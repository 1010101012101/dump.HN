Mine was earning slightly less than me, but she covered the insurance, so that was helpful too. Much more importantly, when there were times that there was no time to see anyone non-business related, when I would get buried in a problem and lost my ability to see the larger picture, and when somebody needed to just drag me away from the computer for a bit, she was there. Not to mention all the help on the domestic/not living like an animal front.<p>It seems like some people need work, problem solving, and/or success like they need to breathe, so their pursuit of those things seems to be enough fuel for them to live off. For the rest of us trying to solve big or small problems, I would say that a strong relationship is an incredibly useful asset.

I certainly don&#x27;t intend it and after rereading my comments I can&#x27;t see how a reader can draw that conclusion.  I even don&#x27;t want bipolar, borderline, narcissistic etc. types to be offended by my comments.<p>I think that the school board is at fault for not inquiring why a person who works primarily with children is receiving psychiatric services.  No, you should not be a teacher or in any profession dealing with children if you cannot behave properly, whether it&#x27;s because you have unresolved personal issues or because you have a disability where you simply cannot realize that certain acts are not allowed or inappropriate.  When the risks are so great - not only the damage to the individual himself, which can persist long after the abusive employee&#x27;s own death, but the possibility that the damaged individual can hurt others and society: prison and/or social support isn&#x27;t cheap - it&#x27;s imprudent and neglectful to not follow up when an indicator appears.<p>I think following up on these indicators would benefit other professional license regimes, not only teachers.  Do you want a cop on the street who suffers from PTSD or substance abuse addiction?  How about a suicidal airline pilot who may suffer from delusions?  Clinical social worker with NPD or history of abusing his own family?  For an engineer or cosmetologist it&#x27;s probably not important.<p>For all of us individually, there are certain professions that we aren&#x27;t cut out for.

9710461,comment,9705971,9706589,0,0,api,,,"You&#x27;re absolutely right that &quot;everything isn&#x27;t broken&quot; and some things are better. The problem is that all the better things are <i>mostly</i> not helping ~90% of the population. You do have orders of magnitude better access to information and better gadgets, but that doesn&#x27;t help you make your bills or plan for retirement (essentially impossible today if you are not rich).<p>Like I said, generally speaking everything is inflating but wages and technology products. We are in something that I&#x27;ve heard called &quot;in-deflation&quot; -- inflation in everything you <i>need</i>, deflation in everything else, and stagnant wages and employment. I think this is at least as bad as the stagflation of the 70s, though obviously a far different phenomenon.<p>I&#x27;m not completely convinced that this isn&#x27;t the result of the &quot;limits to growth.&quot;<p>Americans love apocalypses. They think everything will happen suddenly, explosively, in a film directed by J.J. Abrams with a lot of explosions and a plucky hero. The reality is that things like LTG may manifest very slowly and without much fireworks.<p>Scenario:<p>Commodities just inflate, and inflate, and inflate, and eat up surplus wealth for all but the top. Surplus wealth at the top then inflates things like real estate. Demand collapses, hollowing out employment and accelerating the whole thing (deflationary spiral). Eventually the middle class is destroyed.<p>Then assuming a fairly bad case scenario the die-off begins, but also slowly. In the third world it starts first through warfare, revolutions, disease, and starvation. Finally it slowly progress to the &quot;first world&quot; in the form of decreased longevity and increased mortality among the now impoverished majority unable to afford good health care any longer. Since contraception is still available in the first world, birth rates don&#x27;t spike as they might in poorer places. This saves the developed world from birth spike / death spike Darwinian hell. We go not with a bang but a whimper.<p>In the end we have falling population, collapsing economies, and a wealthy elite cloistered in a few surviving high-tech mega-cities. These are dystopian police states however -- like Singapore with more police brutality and arbitrary power -- so it kind of sucks for them too. Of course the vast global slum also is a police state, but policed more haphazardly with drones and such.<p>In the even longer term these too collapse or are overthrown by angry populist revolutions, knowledge is forgotten, and we&#x27;re back in some kind of dark age. Tall tales are told of the great science and power of the fallen high civilization of old, but also of how its arrogance offended the Gods and brought about its fall... etc.<p>Unfortunately our high-tech civilization is a one-shot. Fossil fuels and concentrated mineral deposits are now depleted. We fell victim to the same game-theoretic Great Filter as everyone else. See: Fermi Paradox.<p>--<p>The above may not occur. The future is hard to predict and complex. But that, I think, is a good expression of how the world <i>looks</i> today and where it looks like it&#x27;s going. It looks as hellishly pessimistic as the 70s, if not worse.<p>In the 1990s a rising tide lifted all boats, opportunity was exploding for everyone, and the Internet was going to transform our society for the better and empower everyone. Libertarianism was popular. That wonderful age ended on 9/11/2001, though the writing was on the wall when the dot.com crash started in 2000. Since then I&#x27;ve seen nothing but escalating pessimism and depression among the general public, though the parallel universe alpha cities of the coasts seem partially exempt.<p>Today the tide is falling but the biggest boats are still rising, opportunity is collapsing for the majority, and the Internet is a surveillance and distraction machine where people look at stupid cat pictures and blob comics while AI profiles them to sell them stuff or manipulate them. Authoritarianism is experiencing a renaissance -- both in populist and hyper-elitist forms.<p>Much like the 70s the music and culture is mostly trash with the exception of a few indie gems. Cinema is remakes of reboots, music is mass produced soulless auto-tuned Muzak, and the Internet has developed a trash culture of its own centered on dumb memes, blob comics, echo chambers, filter bubbles, and verbal abuse.<p>I miss that optimistic world, and much like those in the 70s I worry that it was the apex of civilization... maybe even of intelligence on this planet for this geological epoch. Of course in the 70s you could have said that about the 50s and 60s, so hopefully it&#x27;s a cycle.",1434188358

9710418,comment,9710025,9710025,0,0,Nemcue,,,"tldr; How you use the computer / manage application windows is more important than multiple screens for productivity. If the way you interact with windows and applications isn&#x27;t cerebral then you&#x27;re doing it wrong.<p>First of all, I&#x27;d say his argument is perhaps less applicable if you&#x27;re a programmer. If all you&#x27;re using a word processor and a browser, then maybe you can get by. If you&#x27;re doing programming and designing, and need a couple of applications as well as a few terminal windows — then maybe it&#x27;s not so applicable.<p>However, I do find this subject matter really interesting. I&#x27;ve been thinking and observing about this a lot just this last year, and I think it&#x27;s not so much about screens as it is how poorly most people use computers.<p>I think the main productivity killer is the cursor and how people do window management: focusing an app, resizing, moving, shifting screens and so on.<p>As an example, say you as a professional need to use three applications, and most of the time you use these applications in a maximized state — taking up most of the screen space.<p>Now, if you want to shift attention between these applications, there are a couple of alternatives. You could alt-tab, which is imprecise and slow, since you have to mentally go through the alt-tab stack of applications and find the one you&#x27;re looking for. Of course, you can use alt-tab to toggle between two specific windows, but if you slip up and press it twice then you bring focus to some other application.
It&#x27;s just not really a good way of switching windows.<p>Another way is of course to use some graphical element targeting a specific application. Maybe the bottom menu (the dock on OSX). This is also imprecise and tedious. Windows tries to fix this with having the order of the applications correlate to shortcuts. So the first one can be activated using Windows Key + 1, the second one with Windows Key + 2 etc.
This still leaves you with the problem however that you lose state between toggling applications since your cursor isn&#x27;t where you left it for that particular application. There&#x27;s also not a good way of toggling between <i>windows</i> for an application: say you have two chrome windows, and you want to switch between them.<p>Or maybe you have multiple screens, and you now have to drag the cursor between the windows. Super slow and imprecise, and maybe the cursor even gets caught between the screens since one of them is in portrait mode and the other is in landscape — now you have to spend even more mental effort just to get it to where you want to go.<p>The way I&#x27;ve solved these issues — which has given me a huge productivity boost with a laptop in particular but it&#x27;s also very tangible on desktop computers with multiple screens as well — is to create a really smart system to jump between applications where it remembers where the cursor was for that particular window, and if the cursor is in some nonsensical place when you jump to an application window then it&#x27;s instead reset by centering on that particular window. It also uses a graphical element surrounding the cursor which shows for about half a second, so I don&#x27;t have to spend any mental effort to find it.
I also have a very nice system to manipulate windows which sort of works like Divvy where using the keyboard I can on the fly define a grid on the screen, and move or resize the focused window inside of that grid.<p>Using things like this makes it cerebral. I don&#x27;t have to think, or spend mental effort targeting things. It&#x27;s all super precise and I don&#x27;t even think about windows and screens most of the time, it&#x27;s all mechanics that have become invisible to me when I work.<p>I&#x27;d bet with this setup I&#x27;d be a lot more productive with one screen than someone with two screens without a similar setup.",1434186929

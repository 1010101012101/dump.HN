You have to apply to retrain here, with very specific restrictions, and compete against thousands of other expats. You will never be competing directly against American MDs.<p>This is in direct contrast to the tech industry, which has exactly zero licensing bodies with the ability to dictate who can practice within the profession. Hence, H1Bs galore.<p>People always make the mistake of comparing highly regulated industries to tech. They couldn&#x27;t be further apart. A commenter on the Pao case raised this exact point: maybe women are too smart to get into a dog-eat-dog industry like tech! Women sure as heck have no qualms about law, medicine or nursing! Three professions with excellent guild protections and career stability once an initial licensing hurdle is passed.<p>For better or worse, tech is the wild west of professions. All things considered it&#x27;s absurdly risky to get into, but for the few superstar talents, it&#x27;s very lucrative because there are no barriers to entry. For the above average vet with 40 years of experience though, it can be a nightmare, as an eager H1B will sign up for indentured servitude any day to escape third world poverty.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the tech industry to my kids. Too much volatility and risk. You&#x27;re better off having a steady profession, and pursuing bootstrapped startups on the side. If your idea gets traction, you can always stop practising your profession and return at a later date. That&#x27;s the beauty of guilds like the AMA, you&#x27;ll never be thrown under the bus for a quick buck, because the status of an MD cannot be devalued.",1427587086

9283239,comment,9281466,9282557,0,0,graycat,,,"Let&#x27;s consider your<p>> a complex multi-constraint optimization
NP problem<p>There was a day when I thought that!<p>So, I was thinking non-linear optimization
with, say, some of gradients, steepest
descent, conjugate gradients,
quasi-Newton, Kuhn-Tucker conditions,
maybe some Lagrangian relaxation, etc. and
saw no hope.<p>And I still remember the day when I got an
explanation and learned better!  Can make
the problem 0-1 integer linear programming
but otherwise linear.  The
non-linearities, really complicated costs,
say, have a plane <i>step climb</i> when have a
heavy cargo load, and really goofy
constraints, e.g., don&#x27;t fly over any US
military bases or the White House, don&#x27;t
fly over residential areas at dinner time,
etc., can handle in a simple way before
the optimization itself.<p>The technique has some generality and,
thus, is a good tool to have in a &#x27;data
science&#x27; tool kit, especially with current
computer hardware, library software, and
practical data availability.<p>Here&#x27;s an outline of the technique:  For
one period from, say, 5 PM to midnight
(again from 1 AM to, say, 8 AM) set up a
table with one row for each city to be
served, 90 cities, and one column for each
candidate airplane trip, <i>tour</i>, from
Memphis and back.<p>In this table, for each city and column
put a 1 in the table for that city and
column if the tour for that column serves
that city and put a 0 otherwise.  So,
generate all such columns; may have some
thousands of columns.<p>Considering all fine cost details want to
account for, and taking expectations for
random costs, say, from weather and air
traffic control, find for each of the
candidate tours its cost (first cut,
assume that if a plane goes to a city,
then it completely serves that city).<p>Then for the schedule, want to pick no
more than 33 columns (there were 33 planes
in the fleet) from the 1000s so that all
90 cities are served and total cost is
minimized.<p>So, each column serves, <i>covers</i>, some
cities (each city where the column has a
1), and want to pick columns that <i>cover</i>
all 90 cities -- so have a <i>set covering</i>
problem.  Right, it&#x27;s in NP-complete.<p>So, in particular, we have a linear
programming problem:  We have one variable
for each column.  The costs and those
variables form the linear function of the
variables to be minimized.  The constraint
matrix is just that table we described.
The constraints are that each city is
served by some one column.<p>Or in matrix algebra, we have from the
table described above a matrix A with 90
rows and some thousands, say, m, columns.
We have the variables x, m x 1.  We have
the m costs, 1 x m c.  And we have the
right hand side, 90 x 1 b where each
component of b is 1.  Then we want to find
x to minimize cx subject to Ax = b.  So,
it&#x27;s linear programming.<p>Then in addition we ask that the variables
take on values of only 0 or 1 -- so we
have a 0-1 integer linear programming
problem.<p>If ignore the 0-1 constraint, then have a
fairly routine linear programming problem
but will likely end up with some
<i>fractional</i> tours allocated.<p>For honoring the 0-1 constraints, on this
problem likely could do well enough with
branch and bound.<p>As FedEx grew, the nature of the
scheduling problem changed.  The outline
above should have helped save significant
bucks at least in the early years.<p>Then, of course, that solution technique
could be used to evaluate the few
candidate hub locations.<p>With some generalization, the solution
technique could also be used to evaluate
airplane types to add to the fleet.<p>So, here we have 0-1 integer linear
programming set covering; keep it in mind
and see if you can find another good
application.",1427586378

At a High-Performance Computing seminar I attended a few years ago, the speaker said that around 50% of high performance computing applications are written in Fortran (you know, these shiny little programs that can hog a million CPUs for a few hours or weeks or months). The other half being mostly C and C++.<p>However, programming in Fortran is uncomfortable. Just like programming in C. The advantage of Fortran over C in High-Performance Computing is that it&#x27;s less uncomfortable to write maths and things with arrays in Fortran.<p>If you ever need to handle enormous arrays without breaking a sweat or solve systems of equations with hundreds of thousands or millions of variables, you can give Fortran a try. The syntax has come a long way since FORTRAN 77.<p>Fortran&#x27;s strength has always been speed. In the early days most Fortran programs would run faster than C programs. The trick is to intentionally leave out features that bloat the language such that all there&#x27;s left in the language can easily be optimized by the compiler. Only after the C99 standard (I think), C caught up to Fortran in most applications due to stricter aliasing rules.",1427585972

The fact is that many Italian cities were designed basically in the middle age and they have not changed much since then, hence they have very narrow streets, crossings, and sometimes wide sidewalks. They are simply not made for cars. Anyway, in the last years, the new administration additionally decided to completely &quot;ban&quot; cars from the main streets during weekends and public holidays: no cars of no type, no taxis, bus routes changed to only reach the beginning of the closed roads but they did introduce a small bus line that goes around the closed down zone. The idea was highly criticized at the beginning mainly by the business owners located there, who were afraid of seeing a sharp decline of customers. Instead, after a first period, those &quot;T days&quot; became a success: people re-discovered the pleasure of just walking everywhere on the streets, more and more events were organized, and also shops saw an increase in revenue, and in fact now they are asking to extend this ban to more days.
Personally, I think we should start realizing that cars have put high cost on society in terms of pollution, safety, low efficiency in the use of resources (fuel), stress related to jams (which is a clear alienating experience). Maybe banning them from everywhere is not the solution, but at least the idea that every family must own (at least) a car should be publicly questioned.",1427584830

The challenge in this case is that &quot;what it is&quot; matters less than &quot;where it&#x27;s going&quot; or &quot;why it exists&quot;.<p>In a nutshell: First choose a thread of action - narrow your view to one set of things you already do. Then when you act, you record that you took that action. Add more threads-of-action as you wish, organize as needed. That&#x27;s the beginning of Benome. This pattern remains throughout as the fundamental.<p>This simple pattern allows Benome to become an interactive visualization that combines your past behaviour with probabilities for you future behaviour. A very simple example is that if your chosen thread of action was when you buy tomatoes, and then you choose to share that thread with someone who sells tomatoes, they&#x27;d know when you were ready to buy. But that same pattern can be used for many more applications than simple commerce. You can leverage a detailed awareness of your own behaviour into many personal advancements.",1427584821

To further support his new narrative, he recently withdrew from the expert group and lead role on the JSR-241 [3] that defines a spec for the JVM version of the Groovy Language.

Quoting the article:<p>> What Fujifilm did was to look further than simply moving to digital photography from analog. Instead, the company tapped its chemical expertise for broader uses, such as drugs and liquid-crystal display panels. Cosmetics, as well: It seems the process for stopping photos from fading can be used on skin, too.
> &quot;The most decisive factor [for our success] was how drastically we were able to transform our businesses when digitalization occurred,&quot; Mr. Komori said. What set Fujifilm apart from Kodak, he said, was the Japanese company&#x27;s effort to branch out by employing technologies originally developed for photography.
> And one of Fujifilm&#x27;s latest endeavors is cosmetics—it has its own Astalift skin-care line—that use antioxidation technology for preventing photos from fading.
>The company also has spent ¥650 billion since 2000 to acquire health-care companies. Fujifilm acquired midsize drug maker Toyama Chemical Co. for $1.4 billion in 2008 and last month agreed to buy U.S. medical-equipment maker SonoSite Inc. for $995 million.",1427584096

All drivers &quot;proper&quot; uber and lyft are getting a raw deal.  I feel exceptionally bad for the uber/lyft drivers, they are unwillingly turned into scabs and are under paid given the liability they have to incur. Not to mention some are embarrassingly inexperienced.  I think the wrong windows are being smashed.",1427583799

A god that designed us for a single purpose...<p>Why would a god that needed us to fulfil a singular purpose give us the power to choose to not fulfil that purpose? Why would a god choose a purpose and then not clearly communicate that purpose? Why would a god give us the capacity for reflection and awareness, allowing us to derive our own meanings, if none of those meanings were valid?<p>What would a single meaning of life even look like? Let&#x27;s take a guess and say that love is the meaning of life. That would mean the only point of life was love. All the other experiences? Meaningless. Says who? Who says they&#x27;re meaningless?<p>&quot;A meaning&quot; is like &quot;a sock&quot;. There is only one true sock, all other socks are false, only those that have this sock can truly know what a sock is, etc...

Just try that with the taxi.<p>Also, the cars are better, the people are nicer, you don&#x27;t have to carry cash to pay, and the fees are better. Here in Mexico the illegal taxis (pirate taxis) are a very serious crime. The government wouldn&#x27;t have let Uber entering if they thought it would be like the illegal taxis.

Even though I live 2.5 miles from work now, that road bike still sits in my closet every day. I would love to ride it to work, but LA doesn&#x27;t even have enough lanes to support both driving and parking, let alone biking. The roads are full of traffic and impatient drivers and I value my life too much to risk riding my bike on the couple feet of shoulder that might exist on those roads.",1427583672

There are lots of degrees of success on this one...anything from a useful tool for an individual, to a system for workgroups, to a global network that makes much of the web obsolete. I hope to bootstrap by making something that works at all these levels.<p>I&#x27;m also designing a cryptocurrency system that I think could make a dent in global warming. If the Ethereum project succeeds, it&#x27;ll be a lot easier to implement that one.<p>Last year I did some volunteer fundraising for a small team attempting to invent cheap practical fusion power.<p>Also I&#x27;ve got some less-ambitious projects that I hope will help make a little money along the way.",1427583626

Code4Startup helps you clone websites for the purpose of literally getting a website up for your startup. At Zyring, our goal is to get people to build applications from scratch so they can add it to their portfolio and get a job. That&#x27;s why we put so emphasis on code reviews and feedback.<p>If you have used code4startup, I would love to talk to you about your goals and if there is anyway we can help you.

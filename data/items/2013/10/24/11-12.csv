Why would that be?</i><p>One of the major advantages of developing for the Web is the platform neutrality. You can rise above OS wars and browser wars, and provide something -- <i>one</i> thing -- that almost everyone can use whatever other choices they make.<p>Given the above, why is there any advantage for a developer in having a platform-specific store for web apps, and why would any user want to access web-based software via a store instead of just going to the site? What is the value proposition here?<p>The only thing I can think of is marketing, but I&#x27;m not convinced they offer much benefit there. Despite being a regular user of both Chrome and Firefox since they were new, not to mention a professional web developer, I don&#x27;t remember ever hearing of Firefox Marketplace before this thread and only just read up on what it is. Although I&#x27;d seen references to Chrome Store when starting Chrome, I had immediately ruled it out as clutter that didn&#x27;t belong in a browser and hid as much of it as possible so I could go back to visiting web sites. Certainly no client has ever asked me about using either of these channels for a real project.<p>Of course this is all just personal anecdotes, so it&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;m an outlier. However, it seems like these channels aren&#x27;t exactly Apple&#x27;s App Store where most people get all the software they run on a given device.

I&#x27;ve had some recruiters place me in a position that doubled my pay and challenged me towards greatness.  Another recruiter gave me a really hard sell when I owed the IRS a lot of back taxes...  If it wasn&#x27;t for me they might not have pared down the project plan to something achievable and the might never have gotten the i&#x27;s dotted and t&#x27;s crossed and got the product in the hands of the customers,  but my boss very specifically denied me recognition for my success.<p>The average recruiter,  however,  is filling a hole that is left behind by somebody who burned out.  He&#x27;s hoping that you can hit the ground running without any training,  which is rarely realistic,  particularly considering that 80% of programming work is doing what management expects to deliver 20% of the value.  Because they haven&#x27;t trained any of the other people working on the project you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s difficult to get any questions answered of the order of &quot;how do I get this build consistently?&quot;,  &quot;how do I get this to build in less than an hour?&quot;,  &quot;which module is the right place to add that functionality?&quot;,  &quot;which applicationContext.xml file actually gets deployed to the assembly and how?&quot; and stuff like that..<p>In a case like that you&#x27;re set up to fail and you need to &quot;think different&quot; and start with the 80% of the work that gets you 20% of the way there,  and then when the special job comes around where you&#x27;re the best in the world you can sprout solutions like mushrooms.",1382614628

This thread would be a good place to test-drive an MVP...<p>Scenario 1 is exponential progress - the Singularity which Ray Kurzweil thinks is inevitable and which Eliezer Yudkowsky is trying to bring about. Progress feeds into progress until we enter technology heaven.<p>Scenario 2 is steady progress - the worldview of TED talks and most of Silicon Valley. We gradually solve social and technological problems, and the future is an improved version of the present.<p>Scenario 3 is stagnation. We reach a point where our ingenuity and resources are only sufficient to maintain our current level of civilisation. Peter Thiel might be a proponent of this worldview. If you think &quot;business as usual&quot; is taking us nowhere fast, you&#x27;re likely more interested in out there ideas such as seasteading, charter cities and bitcoin which promise to open up new vistas of innovation.<p>Scenario 4 is steady decline. Dwindling resources lead to fraying social structures which lead to cascading problems - new problems arise faster than we can deal with them. It&#x27;s not a popular viewpoint, but it&#x27;s happened to many complex societies in history. Note that if scenario 2 tends to be a liberal viewpoint, and scenario 3 tends to be a somewhat libertarian viewpoint, then scenario 4 is probably a traditionalist conservative viewpoint (conservatism as in Edmund Burke, not George Bush).<p>Scenario 5 is sudden collapse: everything appears to be going fine until suddenly we&#x27;re all killed by global warming/nuclear war/asteroids/etc. Surprisingly, scenario 5 is more popular than scenario 4, usually because certain groups believe they will live out the apocalypse and get to see the rest of decadent society destroyed.",1382613287

Additionally, Europe and other parts of the world begin to allow such vehicles.<p>Newspapers like Financial Times, NYTimes, WSJ, begin to realize paywalls/subscriptions are not necessarily the best business models. Beginning the process of realizing the old pay model does not work. While at the same time more musicians, small film projects, books get funded by sites like Rockethub, Kickstarter, Indiegogo. Adding to further weight against the old pay model of the entire content creation industry.<p>Part pessimistic, but will add this into optimistic as well. Already companies like JCPenney&#x27;s, Macy&#x27;s etc are facing the competition of not just Walmarts, Targets, but also Amazon and online stores. Optimistic being that stores closings will lead to creative destruction and reinvention of malls across the US. The reinvention wouldn&#x27;t be for a bit longer however.<p>15 years: Malls facing near extinction will need to reinvent themselves. As city greening like in the Bronx, Philly and other cities around the world are currently in their infancy, - Malls are converted to have roof top gardens and become indoor parks for people to be able to exercise with dogs etc, during heat waves, strong winter snaps etc. The heat wave aspect will be especially important as climate change becomes more and more problematic.<p>Autonomous buses replace older buses which require a driver. Cities like Copenhagen, Portland, Philadelphia begin experimenting with &quot;fast lanes&quot; for autonomous buses, which gives them the entirety of street use of selected roadways. Autonomous cars have a quarter of the market and have over thrown the taxi industry.<p>25 years: Autonomous hold 100% of the market. Robotics are heavily used through the households. Households themselves evolve due to climate change, fresh water issues, and stress on waste management/sewage systems. 100% water recycling, reusing, etc per every household. Houses too will compost like how we recycle. Indoor gardening and outdoor gardening will be used more widely with robotics making gardening easier.<p>With the 3D printer revolution in full swing, and recycle/reuse everything rule in practice, it&#x27;ll become rare that anything ends up in the trash stream. Material that will not be reused will be recycled and broken down into raw material form for 3D printers etc. Reused products will make thrift stores more in fashion, possibly taking over big box stores empty from places like JCPenney&#x27;s, Bestbuys, etc going under.<p>3D printing, will take this role. Both low-cost and luxury. Both in big buildings and small. Skyfarms will be easy and cheap to build with such large 3D printers. Some skyfarms will take the role of organic/none-gmo, with locality in focus. Other skyfarms will take the role of massively growing gmo crops year round in a mass-controlled environment. Excess of the crops will be stored for the future, as climate change proves more costly regarding droughts...like the one the the US has been going through.<p>3D printers ability to build large infrastructure will show in bridges and high speed railroads/maglev lines. Particularly in the US - the dream of Boston to DC in an hour or less. Making the east cost a whole lot closer, with Erie, PA, and Buffalo NY becoming suburbs of cities like Philly and NYC, which practically become neighborhoods to one another. High speed rail emerges to compete with autonomous vehicles by providing 300mph or more travel speeds. Cars too will get faster with better technology and be able to go just as fast. Airlines return to Concorde style flights in order to make flying relevant.<p>50-70yrs: But eventually with high speed rails and cars that can go a whole shit ton faster, airlines only advantage is the oceans. The new concord flights are re-designed for international flights, but limited as underwater high speed trains connect the North America to Europe, which re-occurs with various spots throughout the world, some projects more challenging than others, but still achievable. I like to think of this as limited to a few instances, but I could see with 3D printing that later on these projects emerge to connect heavy island areas like the Caribbean, Asian Pacific, etc. I fear for what this might do to the marine life. None the less airlines are forced to reinvent themselves with private spacecraft, space tourism really enters into a new era as it becomes available to the masses and space hotels emerge, with space study laboratories sponsored by partnerships of Universities competing against other partnerships. The same thing emerges on the Moon, with laboratories first obviously, but then the emergence of hotels, and university partnerships laboratories. Towns emerge, mining already in process by this time.<p>100 years from:<p>Laboratories, hotels, towns, mining etc on Mars and possibly there their moons.<p>Mining occurring throughout the solar system.<p>All the while, with this 100 years of climate change, turning us more fully aware of our planet Earth. By now we&#x27;ve already have acted within the first 20 or so years. Wind power, solar power, conservation, recycling, reusing and composting, growing locally while also growing on mass in skyfarms, and possibly beginning to mine landfills for things that can be recycling. Science ideally comes up with ways to help the oceans, capture carbon, and slow down the extinction rate. The understanding of fixing the problems will help us better understand terraforming planets like Mars down in the next 100 years after.<p>Pessimistically: In short, mass job losses around the world due to these emerging technologies will cause upheaval and lead to radicalism, possibly war. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll wipe ourselves out, but we can very well put ourselves back by a few centuries. Though..optimistically...I feel some knowledge will exist past such a war that will allow us to speedily catch back up to where we should be. Still, such a global conflict is unnecessary, as there are ways to help those displaced by technologies - without sending them to the battlefields. Also relating to this..such a war could put us behind in trying to fix key parts of the climate problem, and extinction problem - possibly missing an important prevention of an extinction that may end up proving to be a keystone species that sparks off a domino effect killing the rest of us in the process. I suspect bees as the keystone species. But then again..maybe such a war would cause a population drop off in humanity that would help radically cut carbons from the environment. While we try to regain our balance, we find it harder to deal with climate change and to get to where we were - thus taking longer and thus offsetting the carbon amounts in the atmosphere for longer helping soften the effects for the next century. But yea..such a war would still suck and be unnecessary.",1382613249

Anyway Go seems popular and looks cool and I think that is the next thing I am going to learn.<p>But the point is, what I am doing with Web applications for the most part is making rich UIs.  So I was thinking, since Go compiles so fast, why not just download Go source and escape the browser, and get faster execution etc.?  I mean I  still think ToffeeScript is the best thing ever but Go is not bad at all.<p>So what I was thinking of making would be some kind of P2P-based DHT thing, totally decentralized of course, using UDP, and you can use it to distribute whatever, but two main things would be something like a web site but it would just be markdown and a tarball with Go code.  Then you would display the markdown (maybe let them embed svg) and a button &quot;Run Application&quot; and sandbox the Go code with something like this <a href=""https://github.com/zond/gosafe"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/zond/gosafe</a>.  Maybe have a way to tag sites or some kind of data-oriented alternative to domains.  Point being we are using the web to make it convenient to distribute and access sandboxed applications (even the front ends for e-commerce stuff are becoming thick clients in a lot of cases).<p>It would be nice if we could break out of the browser and also weren&#x27;t subject to the limitations of JavaScript.  And I wouldn&#x27;t miss HTML or CSS at all to tell the truth.  And the other part of this is that the whole server-based model we have needs to go and be replaced with data-oriented networking.",1382612545

Something of the sort. This would maintain the patent&#x27;s value for the inventor in a market, as well as provide reasonable measure against patents being scooped up and plaguing IT for decades.<p>Better yet, though, no more software / algorithm patents.",1382612475

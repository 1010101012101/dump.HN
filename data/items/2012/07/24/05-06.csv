In it he wrote: ""Lets start having fun... lets get funky... let's announce everything... let's be WILDLY positive in our forecasts... lets take this thing to the extreme... if we get wacked [sic] on the ride down-who gives a shit... THE TIME TO GET RADICAL IS NOW... WE HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE...""<p>Years later, Lefkofsky hired a contract worker named Andrew Mason.<p>In Mason, he discovered a naive genius and gave him the money start what everyone thought would be a legitimate business.<p>But then Mason stumbled into a business with an explosively growing top-line (not bottom line or even middle line), and  so believe the conspiracy theorists  Lefkofsky saw another opportunity to be ""wildly positive"" for profit, even if it meant fudging accounting here and there.<p>So Groupon called itself profitable when it wasn't. It moved marketing expenses into capital costs. It confused net and gross revenues. And that's just what it got caught doing.<p>And when it was caught, Groupon's line was: oops, that was a dumb mistake. And while the rest of us rubes believed them, conspiracy theorists say Groupon's people are actually ""dumb like a fox.""\nIn this view, the reason Lefkofsky insists that Mason be CEO is that Mason is young, naive, and plausibly prone to innocent mistakes.<p>These people believe the reason Google exec Margo Georgiadis only spent a few months at the company is that she came in, looked around, freaked out, and got out.<p>These suspicious folks will say: Lefkofsky and company may have believed they were bending rules in order to get Groupon to a point where it could become a legitimate business with clean accounting, but that's still fraud.""<p>Source: <a href=""http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-04-03/tech/31279229_1_eric-lefkofsky-groupon-conspiracy-theory#ixzz21W67Enqu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-04-03/tech/31279229...</a>",1343109316

This is a man who started a business on the side while working the insane hours of a Japanese salaryman.  It isn't that he can't put in the hours, it is what he can do and be productive.<p>Greatly complicating all of this is are two simple facts.  The first is that we can push ourselves and be productive for a short period, so over a couple of weeks we really can work insane hours and be productive.  The second is that we have coping mechanisms to hide our own inability from us - so as our ability to function disappears down the drain, it is very hard for us to judge how impaired we are.<p>To that end, there was an interesting piece of research that I read about many years ago.  The military was conducting research on sleep deprivation.  One of their findings was that soldiers can be trained to operate on 6 hours of sleep, and will self-report that that they are functioning well and getting more done than they could if they slept longer.  However the wives of those soldiers disagreed.  And when ability to perform was judged on standard ability tests, the wives were right.<p>If you, personally, work long hours and consistently get little sleep, there is some food for thought.

Growl retails at $1.99. We are always around the top 20 paid apps and have been for a long time and even that rate, it's not really sustainable for multiple developers.",1343106208

Most of the overhead in this kind of restaurant is in the facility and labor.  The raw ingredients of even the most gourmet waffle should pale in comparison.  And your facility and labor costs should hold about steady unless you're doing an insane amount of additional business from Groupon.  And his base price was $8.  $8 for a waffle.  I'm no cook, but it seems like there should have been a very healthy profit margin in there.<p>I don't own a restaurant or know much about the economics of keeping one open, but this seems like an odd situation to me.",1343106203

However, this is neither unprecedented nor illegal. Ethics committees are widely used to oversee investigational or quasi-elective procedures (ie ""elective"" off-label procedures for non-life-threatening but massively debilitating conditions).<p>It is quite telling that both surgeons still have privileges, and indeed one remains the department chair. The Sac Bee article and the FDA notification letter contain no mention of medical licensure investigations.<p>There is a massive gray area between clinical judgement and IRB or FDA purview. Drs. can and do use drugs and devices far, far off-label all the time - and there is essentially nothing the FDA can do to the Dr.  (however they can come down hard on manufacturers for promoting unapproved uses)<p>The FDA and IRB do not regulate the practice of medicine and ""medical judgement""; those are constrained by medical boards, tort, and in extreme cases prosecution for criminal negligence.<p>This was research misconduct only to the extent that they made the mistake of involving the IRB in the first place.<p>background: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21552172"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21552172</a>\nstudy pro: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2039978/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2039978/</a>\nstudy con: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19404146"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19404146</a>",1343106143

8206729,comment,8206504,8206706,3,0,oatmeal_coffee,,,"How would you define deliberate practice, then? I would agree that deliberate practice may be hard to define across all skills, but it could be defined for a specific skill.<p>For example in programing, I would consider problem sets and side projects with functions and goals that are aligned but still outside of one&#x27;s normal scope of work to be deliberate practice. Working on Project Euler problem sets could be considered deliberate practice. They are problems that can be done in most any programming language, are known to be great for learning a new one, but generally fall outside the usual work of handling data, transforming content, etc.<p>I would consider Project Euler to be akin to practicing scales on a musical instrument: playing scales is not necessarily music in a &quot;having popular appeal&quot; sense, but it does enable new skills and depth of knowledge of the instrument.",1408618593

I&#x27;ve never <i>needed</i> to write a macro (and in Clojure, its somewhat frowned upon to write macros when normal functions will do), but sometimes it saves you from a lot of working around limitations (and every language has limitations). It also allows things to be added to the language as libraries that otherwise would have to be built in - the majority of programmers won&#x27;t need to do this, but if you do, its awesome knowing that its possible. Clojure&#x27;s core.async is an excellent example (Go-style goroutine&#x27;s, as a library).<p><i>I&#x27;ve never run across a situation where the lack of an everything-is-an-expression-is-a-list feature prevented me from doing what I wanted to do.</i><p>Of course not, but you can also do everything you want in assembly. What everything-is-an-expression-is-a-list gives you is 1) uniformity - everything works the same way, so it lowers the cognitive load; 2) simpler code - if you need a statement in an expression, you can do so, and other languages don&#x27;t prevent you from getting the same result - they just take more code, or the code is more complex, or you use less-than-ideal constructs, or...<p>So you never <i>need</i> these things, but they make life more pleasant to have them.<p><i>I just don&#x27;t really feel the need to get repetitive strain injuries in my pinky from reaching for the parentheses all the time.</i><p>I program in Clojure fulltime and I don&#x27;t find that it has any more parentheses than a language like C++ or Java does. On top of that, anyone who programs in a Lisp for a while will use some form of <i>paredit</i>, which makes working with parentheses a breeze to the point where I find I type less than I do in other languages because jumping between parentheses, splicing parentheses-enclosed lists, wrapping things in parentheses and such tasks are a single keypress that just isn&#x27;t possible in other less-parentheses-focused languages.<p>In short, just like significant whitespace in Python, parentheses are a non-issue in practice (after a short adjustment period).<p>But at the end of the day, to each his own. If Lisp doesn&#x27;t do it for you, then that&#x27;s fair enough - you don&#x27;t have to use it :-)",1408618485

That&#x27;s a rather bold claim to levy against an entire field without any evidence to back it up.<p>The 10,000 rule was created by Malcom Gladwell a writer who has received wide criticism within psychology for making claims that go far beyond the empirical evidence. The linked article talks specifically about how the 10,000-rule was mis-attributed to a current psychologist&#x27;s theory.<p>While it&#x27;s true that there are a lot of psychologists out there who are not doing good science, it&#x27;s quite unfair to say that psychology doesn&#x27;t &quot;offer explanations&quot; or &quot;craft testable theories&quot;. Much of the work done in psychology is quite rigorous. Remember, cognitive psychology (brain imaging and reaction time data) and neuropsychology (brain imaging, rat and primate studies) are psychology too, and even personality and social psychology can be done with rigor and an eye toward the limits of what can be claimed based on the evidence collected.<p>I know that psychology has been getting hammered in the popular press lately, but like most of what comes out of the popular press, the real situation is much more nuanced than what they report.",1408618358

This satisfies a certain sense of fairness and justice in life. I also think it&#x27;s just not true, more the product of wishful thinking than any evidence.<p>People have differing levels of talent in different areas, and this <i>does</i> have significant effects on success and ability.

Sosniak (1985) found that international-level pianists had spent considerable efforts to seek out the very best musical teachers during their musical development.

In the South Seas there is a cargo cult of people. During the war they saw airplanes land with lots of good materials, and they want the same thing to happen now. So they&#x27;ve arranged to imitate things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head like headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas — he&#x27;s the controller — and they wait for the airplanes to land. They&#x27;re doing everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it doesn&#x27;t work. No airplanes land. So I call these things cargo cult science, because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but they&#x27;re missing something essential, because the planes don&#x27;t land.&quot;<p>Full text:<p><a href=""http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/cargocul.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/cargocul.htm</a>",1408616359

The last 10% of the project takes the other 90% of the development time.<p>Hofstadter&#x27;s law: It always takes longer than you expect, even after accounting for Hofstadter&#x27;s law.",1408615417

I&#x27;ve read that a lot of DJ types migrated to MixCloud when SoundCloud started to block content because of IP issues.<p>MixCloud doesn&#x27;t let you download (which SoundCloud does sometimes) although it&#x27;s not difficult to find out the streaming URL.<p>I use both services, but I&#x27;m not really happy with the playlist systems of neither. Recommendations, contrary to what other commenter said, are very good.<p>I don&#x27;t really use them with the phone: too much traffic, also train tunnels are bad. I wish it could cache, downloading while on wi-fi and listen later.",1408615366

Because every time a team member would be re-assigned, the social networking account passwords would have to be changed. Security was becoming an issue. This allows you to publish to unlimited Facebook, Twitter accounts. Am adding other services like LinkedIn and Google+ (if they give API access) soon. This service is absolutely free as compared to any other options available online (Buffer for Businesses, Hootsuite etc.). You can add unlimited team members as well as accounts. You can schedule posts as well as use the recommended feature. Happy to answer any questions that you might have. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",1408615277

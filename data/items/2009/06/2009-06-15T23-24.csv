659251,comment,659189,659189,0,0,snprbob86,,,"Centralized systems scale up.<p>Decentralized systems scale out.<p>There is a very big difference that must be understood.<p>I've used Perforce and Team Foundation Server (which is a re-write of Source Depot which is based on Perforce). Each of these systems handle gigantic source trees with ease, but at what cost? No, it's not the local history or branching (as the author points out). The problem has much more to do with the cultural implications.<p>Most open source projects can be downloaded, configured, built, and installed with a series of commands resembling `wget`, `configure`, `make`, and `make install`. Giant proprietary trees usually grow crazy custom processes with makeshift tools and lots of domain specific hacks. Giant open source trees instead develop package managers and powerful overlord processes.<p>Google provides some excellent tree-wide tools in this vein (`gcheckout`, `blaze build`, etc). However, acquisitions and constant growth are assaulting the integrity of their beautiful master tree. Oh, and Google's entire company-wide tree is only a fraction of the size of Windows, or Office, or DevDiv (Visual Studio, .NET Platform, Etc). My understanding is that many individual developers and teams at Google are using Git on their directories until they need to feed back in to the rest of the company.<p>What we need is MORE decentralized tools that work better together. We need to develop tools which, by virtue of their nature, encourage componentization and separation of concerns. Bug trackers, code review tools, build servers, test servers, deployment processes, etc. need to support decentralization. GitHub is a PERFECT example of how to do this: it's a centralized tool but that tool really is just a giant powerful overlord for a decentralized tool. It gets the best of both worlds while encouraging a culture of scaling out. Decentralized tools typically cater to the open source folks, but you need to cater to enterprise needs (which implies a minimal level of central control) to earn mass appeal.<p>Git forces you to have a small tree, so you are forced to build things in pieces. I think that's a good thing, but people who have big trees now can never ever get out. It's pretty much impossible because they, by definition, have too much code.",1245108678

It has a name and and email address (maybe a phone number, it's on my desk at work).  I have no clue why I have it or what the relevance is.  I looked up the domain name, it's a personal site I think (I was doing this last week).  No idea if this guy wanted a job, was a consultant, had $1M of business waiting for me.  I'm also not going to take the time to call or email and ask ""who are you and why do I have your card again?""...  IMO, unless you're a fucking spectacular dude, put some info on your damn card.<p>2) The difference between domain names (and thereby email and websites) is that you can own and control them.  I'm not putting my Twitter ID on my personal card because I still have no guarantee that Twitter will still exist (or that I will still care about it, the novelty of Twitter is fading for me) in another year.  I certainly don't see the value in directing someone to a 3rd party site out my control for them to contact me.

Would that make her a trolley?<p>I'd love to go down point by point with all of your earlier examples. Sounds like fun. But we're already 47 levels deep in this thread, and we're probably the only two who care about it.<p>Suffice it to say that you have basically two choices. You can argue some line of Hegelism, that truth is relative and over time the dialetic of history advances certain societies that are more fit. If this is the case, then the proof is in the pudding: looking back over the last couple of hundred years should give you the survivor/evolved societies, which are, badda boom badda bing, the democracies.<p>Or you can argue some line of reductionism: there are true things that don't change. Societies that are based on these truer things do better than those which aren't. I believe this is more of both of our lines of argument. But even in this case, we're still back to survivorship: no matter what their great qualities, aristocratic societies have consistently underperformed in national defense. Indeed, if anything European history is a prime example of the various wars and conflicts all caused because somebody's cousin claimed a title and somebody's uncle didn't want them to get it. Thomas Paine did a wonderful job of demolishing the idea of kingship.<p>There is no doubt that some people would naturally be able to do certain things better than others. This is self-evident. Where we cross paths is the idea of a stratified society in which a ruling class assumes those roles for life due to blood relations or other unearned criteria. In my opinion, a rotating system based on popular support carries all the benefits of both aristocracy and democracy at the same time. That old representative republic idea still makes the most sense. If you want to add a layer of quasi-permanent public service bureaucracy, on it fine, but we're just splitting hairs at that point.",1245107652

If apple felt that more iPhones would be sold, and at a higher margin, if they opened it up to an alternative carrier in the US market, they'd do it in a second once their initial AT&T contract expires.<p>Further, you can buy a data card for your laptop. It's not like nobody is using their networks to connect to the network. And my point is that they're doing it right now, this very moment, and they're blocking BT and restricting other traffic.<p>Their policies make it very clear that they don't intend their laptop connect cards as a users primary connection, even if their marketing doesn't.",1245107212

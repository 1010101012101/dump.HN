35722,comment,35657,35708,0,0,fallintothis,,,"The same thoughts I had as I jumped over from reddit to here.  Though the discussion on reddit (<a href=""http://programming.reddit.com/info/280e9/comments/c028101"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programming.reddit.com/info/280e9/comments/c028101</a>) does once again raise the age old topic that people seem so fond of (at least over there): bashing Arc for 'not bringing anything new to the table'.  Though, as you point out, I don't think this particular article really needs to spend a few days on news.yc since it's kind of dated and seems an awful lot like a copy-over from whatever is posted on reddit, I would like to know about this.  <p>I know that Paul's offered that Arc is terser - to the point of having the terseness standardized.  I really do see the value in that and don't share in the ""just make CL macros"" sentiment that seems to pervade people lately.  In fact, I'm excited to perhaps someday be able to use Arc.  However, I WOULD like to know what Paul (and other commentators, though again there are more over at reddit so far as that goes) thinks about the vitriolic remarks.  Are they even worth paying attention to?  There always seems to be wanton backlash against things that get posted to sufficiently large news sites (Slashdot, reddit, etc.).  Yet it also seems like a legitimate matter to consider, though it could just be the case that the public-at-large doesn't see the entire picture for not having access to the language.  So, thoughts on this phenomenon, anyone?",1184964998

If javascript on a typical browser takes 45 seconds to work out a solution, then that's enough to prevent spambots from just implementing it without driving the amount of spam they can send out way down.",1184964734

35717,comment,35564,35583,0,0,Tichy,,,"100% agree - I never saw the rationale for the government making risky investments, just because purportedly nobody else does. Imagine your bank adviser telling you they are going to put your money into high risk investments because nobody else does. Yet if the government spends our money like that, few people seem to realize that it is basically the same thing happening.",1184963478

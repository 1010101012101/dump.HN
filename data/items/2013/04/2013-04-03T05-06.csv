5484491,comment,5483582,5484477,3,0,jacquesm,,,"> the profit motive decreases chances of success.<p>Agreed. I think it works that way because if profit is your motive you will run your start-up focusing on the wrong goal, which is to increase your bank account instead of to increase your users satisfaction or the quality of your product. By focusing on a second order goal you will likely lose track of what <i>really</i> matters. But if you focus on what does really matter your second order goal will be achieved as a by-product.<p>I do believe that you can achieve higher profits by tweaking an existing, successful model. But to achieve high profits by going for the money directly only works well for those that are either in finance or direct derivatives of finance (such as bank robbers, who after all have the most direct line between 'profits' and their actions ;) ).",1364968110

I spent quite a bit of time interviewing in startups in New york and SV to explore if they pay better. The answer is a resounding no. Working for a startup as an engineer is a losing proposition.

However, a quick scan of the applications on my Mac only turned up one Qt application that I hadn't already recognized as non-native, and that app was the Kindle application (which had an obviously non-native text rendering system, but excusably so).<p>Qt applications have at least made it to the point where the scroll bars are correct and the menus usually include the standard structure and emacs keybindings work in text boxes, but I've yet to find a Qt application that has a properly integrated help system, and almost every one quits the application when the last window is closed, native toolbars are rare, combo boxes seem to be used frequently where pop-up buttons would be more appropriate, and nobody seems to add any options to the dock icon's context menu. I've seen enough to know that Qt can be a very close approximation if the effort is put forth to make the app act native (probably better than any other cross-platform toolkit), but it's far from free, requires a ton of platform-specific code, and apps that try hard are few and far between.",1364967521
5484451,comment,5483820,5484330,2,0,supersaiyan,,,"Although I agree somewhat, you're doing something wrong. I live there too, my starting salary right out of school with almost no ""professional"" programming experience was around 70k and it was with languages I had never touched - so don't over emphasis the language. I know plenty of people making close to 100k, those jobs may be limited but they are there for good programmers. There are a lot, and I mean a lot of shitty programming jobs in Ontario, mostly because programmers are hired by non tech firms that have some tech side to be code monkeys. I basically rejected a handful of lower salary jobs right out of schools or jobs where interviewers where asking extremely language specific questions (I had an interview where a guy kept asking me syntax based questions in JS, when I made it abundantly clear I did not know JS, and this went on for 45 mins of me guessing syntax...) until I found a job that had decent pay (a little under 70k - this was still depressing as most my friends had 95k+ salary in SF) and interesting work; but left a year later because the salary wasn't competitive with the rest of the world, bonuses were crap and there was little room for growth. The best advice I can give you is work on personal projects and don't use your co workers salary as bases of average range, because you will run into the situation where dev x whose been at the company for 30 years is only making 30k more and they use that as a basis to justify your salary. I know people that were working at my first job with almost 10 years more experience then me making 10-15k more then me, and there is a reason why they would have had a hard time getting jobs elsewhere; A lot of Canadian companies will have you sign contracts that anything you invent(which includes any personal projects) in your own time will belong to the company unless you get explicit permission from their over paranoid lawyers, this process takes about 2-3 weeks and most good hackers stop hacking and fall for daily routine work, 9-5. Although it protects the company for minor legalities it completely destroys the hacking culture (why do you think RIM failed to innovate?). So although they have thousands of hours worth of experience its in closed system, and redundant.

It has been a year since I last used Qt, but given the frequency with which I hit bumps in their integration with OSX, I'm quite sure that they haven't all been fixed by now.<p>Keyboard shortcuts, drawers, and focus passing would randomly fail to work, since Qt was welded into the Cocoa event system and sometimes missed rather important edge cases. For instance, pressing the Esc key was programatically indistinguishable from clicking the 'Ok' button in custom drawers. More often, power-user shortcuts were overridden, didn't respect configuration changes, or entirely absent. Some views (table view IIRC) didn't even try to exactly mimic the native look and feel. Menus worked in fundamentally different ways on different platforms: if somebody designed an app to work on Windows, which does menus on a per-window basis rather than globally, menus  would randomly appear/disappear on OSX. Oviously this wouldn't be a problem if all your users knew about it, but they won't. Integration with launch services was absent or crippled. Docking windows required tons of theming if you didn't want them to look like crap. Sometimes constraints or conventions imposed by cocoa were overridden, leading to subtle differences in the positioning of button text and so on. I spent 2 person-days hunting down the cause of a 2-pixel border between the edge of one view and the window backing; the hunt ended in failure when I realized that I would have to monkeypatch or completely replace Qt's layout system in order to get the view snug against the edge. Sometimes Qt's abstraction layer led to unacceptable performance tradeoffs that would be easy to solve on any given platform but were simply not addressed in the Qt API. In general, the UI design tools didn't enforce platform-specific conventions and were miles behind XCode in terms of ease-of-use.<p>I had a few problems that weren't specific to integration, but they were just as frustrating. The documentation, while great for an open source project, was still far behind the status quo for native libraries. I found their documentation on coordinate systems very difficult to understand (in comparison with the Cocoa documentation) and sometimes it was just plain wrong, e.g. about mouse event propagation within graphics views (and you would think that would be a fairly heavily trafficked page, no?).<p>If you want your Qt app to seem native, you had better be prepared to dig through Qt itself and patch its deficiencies. This often means being intimately familiar with the native libraries, since the bugs reside at edge-cases the Qt devs <i>weren't</i> thinking about when they wrote the code.<p>Honestly, if I had to do it all over again, I think I would have just insisted coding the front end twice using native libraries and development libraries each time.",1364967144

But that it would cost ~$3m.<p>The patent trolls also were going after names such as Amazon, Facebook, and other huge companies. The troll was asking for $200k for a license from each company. As far as my friend knows, they ALL settled (or at least many of them had).<p>There were 15-20 names on that list. If they'd simply put the $200k-$300k of ""licensing fees"" into a common pot and used that money to fight the troll, then it would have done a small amount of good in defeating one troll's patent.<p>But really the whole system does need serious reform. His suggestion was to cause the patent trolls to have to PAY for legal fees if they lose a patent challenge, though that would just encourage them to sue from individual corporations that would declare bankruptcy on losing.<p>But I think software patents should simply be disallowed, or the bar raised (somehow?) to exclude anything vague and hand-wavy. One thought I've had was to <i>require</i> an implementation of the process being patented.

I mean sure it happens and if you're holding a big pile of options when you hit a billion dollar IPO, that is going to be a good day for you.<p>For most startups though, you get a fraction of a percent  of a common or option pool which will perhaps accrue some value later on if the company doesn't fail utterly.<p>So before you count any options as money in the bank, you need to know a whole bunch of stuff (and I am totally an amateur at this but I've done startup rides once or twice. I am, shockingly, not filthy rich from my piles of options.)<p>1) What percent of what pool do you have options to?
The number of options you have is irrelevant, since the size of the pool is a number which is more-or-less randomly chosen when the company is founded. 5000 options sounds like a lot until you find out the option pool has 25 million shares and is 10% of the company.
2) The strike price of the option, that is what your option will cost to buy after it vests. Having 10,000 options to buy at $5/option is not really that great if they're only worth $3.<p>3) Remember your options can be diluted at basically any time. The company runs out of option pool and wants to grant some to new employees? That'll dilute your options. Or if the company raises more investment. Etc. The answer to point 1 and 2 is changing all the time (well, hopefully not <i>that</i> often!)<p>4) Since options are common stock, they're paid out last. Investors (usually) get preferred stock. So for example, investors hold $50 million worth of preferred stock and the company sells for $51 million. The investors take their cut first, and people holding common stock get paid out of the remaining $1 million.<p>Anyway, just a random option rant. Probably inaccurate in all sorts of ways. All that said, I do love doing the startup thing. It's just so much fun! I aim for that, rather than some possible future value my options my get me.",1364966022

New is not always better but consumer products need to be ""new and improved!"" in order to give the customer a sense they are buying something better than the model from five years ago.<p>But at the same time I can't help but feel that progress can only be made with change and at this point Apple can't keep relying on minimal hardware advances to keep their marketshare.",1364965533

At least to me, it seems like when you are looking only at your exit, you might make that exit, but you won't really make much else of value along the way.<p>In other words, when your goal is not to build a sustainable, profitable company with lasting value, but rather just to get out as fast as possible with as much money as possible... just how far away is such a person from ""scam artist""?",1364965343

(Let's leave aside, for the moment, that this was in reaction to an article about the ""Best"" Entrepreneurs, not the companies with the brightest futures).<p>But, obviously, it takes a lot of foresight and a deep knowledge of the company in question to know whether or not it's doing that.<p>You mentioned Google. I'd use his own example, to illustrate A) the grandpa factor, and B) the foresight problem.<p>He uses the example of Bill Gates. ""At 20, Bill Gates had started his own company and written ... A BASIC INTERPRETER.""<p>Grandpa factor: lots of us write interpreters; some of us even mess around with interpreters written in asm on old-timey hardware; it wasn't even rare at the time. There were TONS of nerds who wrote and write interpreters, and I'd be very surprised if a majority of the companies he mentions didn't have someone on staff who'd climbed that particular molehill. So, Grandpa Factor -- the things that a lot of these startups are doing are probably as impressive as anything Gates <i>started</i> <i>out</i> doing. And I don't think even Gates would argue that it was easier to set your sights on ""BASIC Interpreter"" than ""carbon nanotubes in my dorm room.""<p>Second, foresight. Given that all startups look like crap in their early stage (and we're now shining the light of journalism into startups at TREMENDOUSLY early stages, 'just another hobbyist implementing a standard basic interpreter'), etc, how do you know which crap will turn out to be valuable?<p>Anyone could probably have told, from his education and personality, that Gates was an ambitious, intelligent young man. Okay. That's a long way from ""The umpteenth young gun writing an interpreter for frikkin BASIC is going to take over the world of personal computing.""<p>This article is noise. You need to know why Twitter is valuable before you could honestly critique Tumblr or any number of these other social/real-time media services. You need to know just how bad Gates, Google et al <i>all</i> seemed at first before you can have credibility when you trash a wide swath of early-stage companies as a total waste of time.<p>( I have reservations that are similar in nature to his own, actually -- but I know enough not to confidently assert that, say, Tumblr will leave no trace on the tech landscape. And, of course, this is a Best Young Entrepreneurs article, not at all a Best Companies Started By Young Entrepreneurs -- you can argue that there shouldn't be a difference, but then you're arguing that Business Week should have better taste, and who cares?)",1255521003

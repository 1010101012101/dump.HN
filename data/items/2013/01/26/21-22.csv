If you want something done, then one should not be afraid to dive in and learn some C to figure it out. I don't know a lot of C though I learned on it, but I knew enough to open up the PHP source code and figure out what was going on with a multibyte encoding issue to file an accepted bug report and a follow-up feature request. Why don't I do that for parameter ordering in functions? Because, like the author stipulated, I'm not one of the people who cares enough to want to.

The problem is their licensing fees. Python, Ruby, Node, and PHP have no licensing free and deployment costs are negligible. Most developers would agree that PHP is horrible; despite that it  is very popular, because it is free.<p>Once performance becomes an issue, compiled languages become more advantageous. This is why twitter is now on java/scala, and stackoverflow is on .net.<p>Dynamic languages are certainly less restricting and may be faster to development at the start, but have a major maintenance and debugging cost. I shutter when I think about trying to modify and huge javascript or php codebase. With .net, no big deal.<p>As a personal preference, I like objective-c, it has the benefits of dynamic and static languages and it very performant.

I was <i>heavily</i> involved in GCC development for quite a while, though I now work more on LLVM.\nI'm still a listed GCC maintainer.\nI <i>guarantee</i> you, without a doubt, that GCC will die out on its current path.<p>The only thing that could stop it is if it's no longer an FSF-run project, or the steering committee actually started replacing older members with people still working on GCC, or something else drastic.    This would enable folks to do things that currently take a lot of energy to fight about.  It may also have to compromise some core values in order to serve the most users.<p>Yes, LLVM currently lacks optimizations GCC has.  But LLVM will do the same thing GCC did to commercial compilers when we started the tree-ssa project, and cherry pick the high end of research, and implement it (it has already started).<p>As long as GCC stays on the path it is, it will die. It will be a long time, because it has a lot of users.\nLLVM is friendlier to developers, researchers, and users.\nGCC can't win any fight as long as that is true.<p>FWIW: I also don't think most GCC developers harbor any illusions about the above.  I think RMS may, or may not be involved enough to care, but nobody seriously involved in GCC thinks that GCC is in ""a-ok great shape no problems""<p>The other possibility, of course, is that LLVM will end up on the same path GCC does, and thus, they will be on the same terms again.\nI doubt this, since Chris Lattner saw what happened when he tried to merge GCC and LLVM, and despite his flaws, is <i>much</i> more savvy about politics and community policies than GCC is.",1359237012

Apple Mail is for stuff I care about - work, personal projects, family relationships, and other serious topics that are worth investing time in.<p>Gmail has top-notch spam detection, and there's no need to wait while thousands of emails download, which is great. As for negatives, I find the GMail interface to be cluttered and confusing, with its ads, the annoying black bar at the top, random hovering elements, and the occasional exhortation to Buzz / gchat / new Compose experience / whatever it is this week. The UI is unpleasant to spend extended periods in, which isn't conducive to thoughtfulness.

The biggest gains for hotels happen actually when they set their mind to it that they want to shift the source of their business away from the OTAs to more direct business: direct can be the online booking tool on their own hotel website, mails, repeat customers, phone calls. yes even phone calls, that should be one of the goals when setting up a mobile hotel website.<p>To achieve this hotels should invest in a decent website, start blogging with a voice that they cultivate over time and go for better rankings in the SERPs. That, plus a humming hotel operation with systems in place to handle the direct business is the way to go.<p>This way even smallish properties can run circles arround bigger competitors. The bigger hotels have a hard time to copy this, as they are not as agile, and need meetings to figure out a ""social media strategy"".<p>Figure I know quite a bit on how to make hotels way more independent of OTAs as a booking source: this is actually the core of my SaaS offering: <a href=""http://www.igumbi.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.igumbi.com</a> . It is an online pms, revenue/ yield management system and has a online booking tool for the hotel website. JSONP based and no sucky flash or iframe.<p>The most important aspect of the yield management architecture I find to be the use of nesting. It's a very flexible, value based approach on assigning fixed capacties to sellable allotments. This robust inventory algorithm, devised by MIT's Belobaba, is the thing that executes the yiled management settings.

Maybe that is because they get noticed (branding), and thus the number of supporters increase. Maybe people in their busy lives rationalize that if someone managed to break a government website like USSC, then those people means business and are serious enough to stop and get listen to. If then newspapers make a big deal out it, people will rationalize further and consider it to be important.<p>I too hope however that they do publish their data about injustice and corruption.

As it turns out the claims in the story were false. This latest version at least gets right that he is not on the list of influential Enlightenment era authors. That's true. Not pointed out though is that he is more covered throughout the rest of the curriculum than just about any other figure. Also relevant and not mentioned in these articles is the simple fact that Jefferson's two books were both private projects which he didn't publish or intend to, his Jefferson Bible edit and the Farm Book detailing daily goings on at his farm. As these were not published in his era they are certainly not major Enlightenment era works. His biggest writing contribution is in the large number of personal letters he wrote to friends and colleagues, which were not published as a collection during his lifetime. That these establish him as a major enlightenment era writer is not something beyond doubt. We can reasonably include the Declaration of Independence as a product of Enlightenment thinking, and Jefferson was the author of this work which summarized the thoughts of himself and others who met at the time. But we must remember it is a single brief work and it is comprehensively covered in the curriculum, just not under the brief list of suggested Enlightenment authors.<p>As far as the claim that listing the middle names of Presidents is teaching children a false history, it is an absurd claim provided the middle names are accurate.<p>Regarding the discussion about creationism, creationism is not mentioned or included anywhere in the Texas curriculum standards.<p>A few years ago the media jumped on Kansas curriculum standards, and yet here we are and Kansas continues to do quite well compared to other states on things such as SAT and ACT scores, which unlike state achievement tests are comparable between states because the same test is given in all states. Because of this embarrassing fact that Kansas schools do quite well in impartial evaluations by respected outside parties, this genre of article has given up with the Kansas argument and moved on to Texas.<p>I recommend that anyone interested in whether the claims in the article are true download the Texas curriculum standards for themselves and check, in addition to refreshing their knowledge of history.<p>edit: It's always amusing when one posts facts that are so uncomfortable to propagandists and the uneducated that they not only downvote that post, but they go back and systematically downvote everything one has posted in the last week.

However the situation and the initial conditions in each country are different. What works in Burma might not work in US.<p>> ... before they were adopted, on the example of Minnesota's sentencing guidelines, federal sentences were just about wholly indeterminate,<p>Ok so how do you explain what happened and how downloads of scientific articles can result in threatening someone with 35+ years in prison. Isn't this exactly the area to attack, just because it was random before now it is predictably horrible. I would take the randomness again. At least then someone can point to the judge and say, this judge is out of control, they are responsible, they are ruining lives and wasting tax dollars.<p>Now they have a list of minimum requirements and they can all point their finger too everyone dismisses the accusations with ""But I am just a part of the system"".<p>The goal is not necessarily to remove the sentencing guidelines but to make them sane. You assume it the goal is to remove them.<p>> I know actual freedom fighters, that is publishers of opposition magazines and organizers of nonviolent protests, from Taiwan.<p>Again, Taiwan is not US. By comparing the two you are also implicitly lowering the standard and expectation for US. The assumption being ""US is just like Burma and Taiwan, what works there should be applied here"". I think first we should examine that assumption. Pretty scary. Here is a country that managed to convince most of the its population and those from other countries that it is qualitatively superior. Founded on unbiased justice, representative democracy, everyone has a right to happiness. There is freedom to prosper. And now we are left comparing it to Burma. That is interesting.<p>Absolute comparisons are good to conduct (when possible). We are still better than North Korea or Eritrea. So we are looking good there. But there is also a relative comparison -- between the image a country projects of itself (via propaganda, or what most people expect from it) and its reality. There is also comparison between the countries at roughly the same level of development (comparing Burma to Taiwan) but then also comparing US with say Norway.<p>In this case the most important is comparing US to the image most expect from US. Here the situation is not pretty.<p>Also, I don't necessarily agree with attacking websites, but I don't necessarily disagree it. If it reveals corruption, good, make those servers burn. We don't know what it will reveal, so I can't say if this is effective or desirable.",1359234057

I certainly find them more intuitive then the alternatives. <p>Another feature is the nested defines - that is quite nice (considering that you can put very little into a lambda).",1190428273

58238,comment,58025,58204,0,0,asdflkj,,,"Actually, there already is stuff that's far more refined (and empirically true) than Ayn Rand. It's called evolutionary psychology. Unfortunately, understanding it leaves one feeling rather unedified. It's like realizing that you've been a pawn in somebody else's game, and will continue to be one until your life ends. With Ayn Rand fans, this kind of message doesn't seem to be in demand.",1190427458
58236,comment,58025,58228,0,0,ingenium,,,"See, the problem is that you are simply wrong. I do not believe in the soul, and I cannot say for certain that it does not exist. I CAN say for certain that we are just cells and molecules. Our brains are composed of neurons, which are simply complex chemical reactions. The cell is basically a test tube, separating off the chemicals from everything else. A certain threshold of a chemical interacts with a molecule on the neuron surface, and it ""fires"", which causes it to release chemicals to an adjacent neuron, and this repeats. <p>If we had a powerful enough computer to simulate the physics of how each cell works or simulated the connections of neurons, do you really think it won't be able to ""think"" like we do? Our brains really aren't any different from a computer. A neuron either fires or it doesn't; on or off; 1 or 0. <p>Humans aren't special. Other animals can clearly think and react to their environment to make ""decisions"", but they just aren't as powerful of a computer as we are. <p>On that note, I assume you also believe we have free will? Well, we don't. With a certain set of stimuli, you will make the same decision/""choice"" every time. If you understand what I said above, this would become apparent.  <p>With regards to the soul, where did the soul come from? Do primates have souls? If they don't, then it had to come into existence at some point. Was there a set of parents who were soulless and had a child who magically had a soul? What about groups of people that had a long time in isolation to evolve separately, such as the indigenous peoples of Australia and the Americas? Do they have souls? How about the ""hobbit"" that was found in Indonesia that's 12,000 years old and is a separate branch from homo sapiens? What about neanderthals? <p>If a human gets a soul upon conception, and identical twins are caused by a zygote that splits, does each twin only have half a soul? ",1190427262

While these social networks are interesting projects, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a single company like Google to run the underlying network and maintain the user information.  Certainly such a ""platform"" is not stable in the long term for building startups on if for no other reason than the social graph owner(s) can shut you and your applications out on a whim.",1190426540

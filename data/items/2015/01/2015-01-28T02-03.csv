Among other things, the attachment point matters a very a great deal.<p>The attachment point is the % of cumulative losses after which a given tranche starts suffering losses of principal. So for example:<p>L+20 with a 20% attachment point against historical max losses in the asset class over all credit cycles of 1% is a lot better on a risk adjusted basis than L+200 with a 40% attachment point against historical max loss experience of 15%.<p>Without talking about historical loss experience we can&#x27;t really guesstimate the margin of safety here nor say that a given tranche is or isn&#x27;t good value.<p>Another possibly interesting nitpick: LIBOR isn&#x27;t risk-free. It&#x27;s an interbank rate so it is the short-term yields paid by highly rated financial institutions. Risk free means backed by an entity that can print money, like the Fed. That&#x27;s why the LIBOR-Fed Funds basis exists.<p>Also, re: &quot;I think it&#x27;s interesting how high interest rate risky loans can be considered as sleazy while giving opportunities to the less fortunate is considered an admirable goal.&quot; check out the book _Scarcity_ by Mullanaithan and Shafir, which has a super interesting take on this question!",1422413747

It&#x27;s very hard to find good data, especially market data for these more esoteric products (spreads, yields, assumptions). A lot of companies make a lot of money selling this data (I mean A LOT). For instance, a weekly financial newsletter on asset backed securities (~10 pages long, pdf, emailed out) is $3,500 a year [0]. It&#x27;s a good read though and definitely contains info you can&#x27;t find in other media outlets<p>Anyway, if you&#x27;re interested in structured products, I would just google &#x27;[structured product] primer&#x27;. There are a lot of great primers publicly available. Most are really old (2006 - present) but don&#x27;t let that put you off. All the fundamentals are the same and they&#x27;re definitely worth a read. Some are more relevant since they&#x27;re still being structured. Examples include ABS (which include prime and subprime auto) and CLOs (collateralized loans). Others (like non-agency, subprime, most CDOs) are not. This [1] book was also helpful and more in-depth than most primers.<p>Feel free to pm me for more info.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.abalert.com/subscriber/subscribe_now.pl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.abalert.com/subscriber/subscribe_now.pl</a>

In my experience most people I see use a laptop only use power and maybe a wireless mouse receiver and a monitor. I don&#x27;t see many people plugging 12 things in.<p>Batteries - Macs get phenomenal battery life, it&#x27;s not an issue for most people. Much like iPhones there is an argument for swappable batteries but it doesn&#x27;t seen to have a large effect on sales. People seem happier with the thinness and weight savings, or at least don&#x27;t mind the tradeoff much.<p>Spill resistant keyboards - Are most PC laptops outside of the toughbook market? I wouldn&#x27;t have even thought about this.<p>Matte screen - That was an issue. I am typing from the last matte screen MBP Apple made, I didn&#x27;t like the gloss. I&#x27;ve seen the newer machines in person and while they do reflect more light they&#x27;re much better than they were years ago. The better contrast and color saturation would be worth it to me when I replace my laptop.<p>Then again, I imagine the average person always liked the glossy screens because they looked better at first (much like the poorly adjusted TVs at BestBuy).<p>Some Macs still have Ethernet, but WiFi is pretty ubiquitous. When I&#x27;m at my desk I&#x27;d just plug an adapter into my monitor and it would work (thanks to Thunderbolt). RAM and HD are another design decision Apple has made that people seem to accept.<p>I do love OS X. You seem almost dismissive of the trackpad, but I <i>LOVE</i> the thing. I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re a TrackPoint person, and I get that. But the laptop world seems to have standardized on touchpads and Apple&#x27;s are phenomenal. For years they were MUCH bigger than PCs and the gestures works great. For years PC laptops (especially budget ones) seemed to have odd &#x27;scroll strips&#x27; and I read complaints about them in reviews.<p>I&#x27;ll also mention MagSafe. It&#x27;s saved my laptop numerous times and is extremely easy and fast to connect (or disconnect).<p>In general Apple&#x27;s laptops are just well built and feel solid. Some PCs are like that, many aren&#x27;t due to cost. If I&#x27;m going to use a machine every day for 4 years I want to know it&#x27;s well built and holds up well. That&#x27;s never been a problem with my Macs, anecdotally I&#x27;ve heard things all over the place for PC brands. Things where Lenovo makes great laptops except for line &#x27;X&#x27; which is built poorly, or the 2013 version of thing &#x27;Y&#x27;.<p>There is a lot to be said for a well built laptop with very consistent quality, thin, low weight, and excellent parts. It&#x27;s easy to try Apple stuff in person thanks to stores and it&#x27;s easy to narrow down what you want because they don&#x27;t sell 40 individual models (before customization). There is a very large &#x27;no hassle&#x27; factor when it comes to buying, I don&#x27;t have to worry that I spent 5 hours picking the right machine only to have it show up on my doorstep as something I don&#x27;t like and have to send back.<p>> (if you need/like OSX, there is little choice)<p>Now THIS is a potential problem to me. I don&#x27;t blame Apple for not selling OS X, but I know that I&#x27;m at Apple&#x27;s behest. If they decide to make computers I don&#x27;t like for a few years I know I either have to wait it out or switch platforms. With a Windows laptop you decide to leave Lenovo and go to Dell or HP without having to change your whole day-to-day environment.<p>(I&#x27;m ignoring Hackintoshes. I don&#x27;t want to spend the time to deal with the possible problems.)",1422413107

Which isn&#x27;t true for everyone, so this is one that can be dropped off a lot of people&#x27;s lists.<p>Going outside can often be stimulating, if you&#x27;re open to it. I don&#x27;t get to do it as much as I&#x27;d like, but camping or at least hiking is fun. I went to a friend&#x27;s wedding in November in a state park. I stayed at the lodge in the park and from my window I had a fantastic view of the trees in their autumn colors, blanketing the mountains. A friend and I hiked a few miles of trails, seeing the waterfalls and river from various angles. A very memorable and enjoyable experience. My only regret is that my girlfriend couldn&#x27;t make the trip, but it gives me something to show her in the future. And then there&#x27;s stargazing, or catching rare or uncommon events like a lunar eclipse or a total solar eclipse. I still remember the time in high school my dad snagged a couple pairs of night vision goggles and drove us out to the middle of the desert to watch a meteor shower. That was 15 or so years ago and the memory is still strong in my mind.<p>Dating is hardly less stimulating than games. I&#x27;ve, admittedly, not got much experience because, well, my 20s were wasted. But, I&#x27;ve never experienced this level of fear and exhilaration and happiness all rolled into one moment in anything other than dealing with someone I loved.<p>Hanging out with friends is a broad thing. While not video games, my friends and I play boardgames, card games and tabletop RPGs. For me, I count these as distinct from video games because they require enough effort to setup and play that they can&#x27;t touch the addictiveness of video games. We also go to the nearby big (hah!) city&#x27;s downtown and have a good time checking out local productions of plays and art by local artists at the galleries. Eating at restaurants with interesting cuisine. All these things are stimulating, and to a variety of senses. And it&#x27;s a shared experience with people I care about and that care about me, making it an emotionally satisfying experience.",1422412035

They still run on fox pro. Yes. Fox pro. They&#x27;ve built a relatively feature stable foundation which they can keep selling to customers. Great right? Customers clearly don&#x27;t care about the tech running in the background. If you are in there just for the money that works I guess. And that was the problem of customers over tech approach. The UIs were shoddy. There were bugs. The UX ended up making users go through frustrating processes to complete tasks. Report generation was slow. There was a mountain or two of technical debt in the code base that had no tests. And while the money kept rolling in, it felt wrong to keep pushing the product when it wasn&#x27;t something we ourselves couldn&#x27;t fall in love with.<p>The second example is an ecommerce company that I worked at that kept pushing ahead with feature after feature on one tight deadline to a tighter deadline right after. The result was a system that eventually started seeing >10 second load times. We also had a process where customers would come and pay us offline (online payments are still in early days where I am) and the system would slow down heavily during peak hours. But again, the customers were coming so my personal feelings on long load times and long wait times was just nonsense right? Again. Money or love? Which comes first?<p>At this point I need to say that my personal choice is love first. If making money means I have to sacrifice the love for the experience I&#x27;d rather not do it at all. This is just the other side of the coin of going (IMO) deep into the mantra of &#x27;customers don&#x27;t care about tech&#x27;.<p>Ultimately this is just my opinion. I thought it would be worth sharing. Cheers :)",1422411964

Since you&#x27;re looking to do a small area, you probably won&#x27;t have enough capital to bury fiber which is a shame because that&#x27;s when you start getting the biggest bang for the buck.  There&#x27;s a couple different angles you need to assess.<p>Politics/Bureaucrats -- what laws are in place to prevent you from deploying in X fashion?  Can you bury fiber?  Do you have to string across utility poles?  If so, who owns the poles? (It&#x27;ll either be the city or a utility company) What are their rates?  What are the requirements to get quotes for their rates? (CenturyLink requires you to be a part of an NDA/Non-Compete Agreement program if you are reselling competitive services)<p>Business -- how many people are you looking to service?  What&#x27;s the absolute max you could potentially service? (usually subdivisions are zoned with a specific max amount of households)  How many would you like to service?  What is an acceptable cost? (I found $100 is the sweet spot for gigabit fiber)  What kind of customers will you be servicing? (mostly soccor moms who will browse the internet from 11a-3p, young families who embrace video streaming from 8p-11p, retirees who only care about email and facebook from 9a-12p, etc.)<p>Technical -- how much bandwidth do you <i>really</i> need?  Chances are you can actually service 100 or so residential customers with just a single gigabit ethernet connection.  How much fiber will you need to run to everyone?  The easiest thing to do is run single-mode fiber connected to a media converter in their house.  Depending on how you can do &quot;huts&quot; (as google has dubbed them) you will probably do single cisco ToR switch with 48 spf+ ports for 40 customers.  You will dedicate 4 ports for uplink connectivity via LACP and have 4 stand-by ports should one be bad.  Scale this out as needed.<p>This will also be specific to your area -- but expect $10k/mile to run conduit to a hut with an additional $2k/mile for different fiber pulls.  You would usually run conduit <i>and</i> some kind of fiber at the same time -- probably 96 strand single-mode.  But that&#x27;s up to you.<p>Not sure what else you need to know.  That should be a good starting ground.  The bulk of our capital was for fluid insurance bonds.  About 80% of our working capital was going to be tied into those while we laid the fiber.",1422411516

IMHO, this would have been a more interesting and valid point.<p>The current post is a straw man argument for a few reasons.<p>First, because vulnerabilities will be exploited whether the window of availability is 1 day, 100 days, or 1000 days (like this one) and likewise, upgrades will be missed, for various reasons, whether or not they are encouraged.<p>Second, the author spuriously implies that a 6 month sliding upgrade window (&quot;one size fits all&quot;) approach is superior, easier and more appropriate for everyone through a combination of broad assumption and vague hand-waving about developer time efficiency. Rubbish.<p>If you want newer code, then ASAP is the go and BSD-style monolithic releases are <i>bad</i>... something closer to the versionless OS ideal of constant, incremental, package-wise release processes such as Gentoo&#x27;s <i>portage</i> (BSD-inspired!) where you can even install a <i>-9999</i> (<i>git HEAD</i>)  version of many packages would be ideal. Obviously, with such an approach, stability caveats must be considered (as they are). Thus, both FreeBSD and OpenBSD actually represent a &#x27;middle-ground&#x27; between Gentoo and commercial Linux vendor LTS, with OS wide release processes incorporating some greater collective package and package interoperability testing, combined with the package-wise release of things through the ports trees.<p><i>What&#x27;s the real ideal here?</i> A general purpose means to build working, tested, maintainable, secure systems with minimal effort for a broad audience.<p><i>How to get there?</i> Clearly, not by whinging about external release window frequencies of volunteer-based projects, as any frequency still creates bugs, and no process is perfect.

Investment managers are desperate to earn a slightly higher return that the risk free rate.

Credit standards have probably degraded to try and meet the demand of abs securities, but that&#x27;s inevitable.<p>This part terrifies me.

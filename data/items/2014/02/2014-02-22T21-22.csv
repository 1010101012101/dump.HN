The stock market advanced significantly, with the Dow peaking in August 1987 at 2722 points, or 44% over the previous year&#x27;s closing of 1895 points.\nOn October 14, the DJIA dropped 95.46 points (a then record) to 2412.70, and fell another 58 points the next day, down over 12% from the August 25 all-time high.\nOn Thursday, October 15, 1987, Iran hit the American-owned supertanker, the Sungari, with a Silkworm missile off Kuwait&#x27;s main Mina Al Ahmadi oil port. The next morning, Iran hit another ship, the U.S. flagged MV Sea Isle City, with another Silkworm missile.\nOn Friday, October 16, when all the markets in London were unexpectedly closed due to the Great Storm of 1987, the DJIA closed down another 108.35 points to close at 2246.74 on record volume. American Treasury Secretary James Baker stated concerns about the falling prices.\nThe crash began in Far Eastern markets the morning of October 19. Later that morning, two U.S. warships shelled an Iranian oil platform in the Persian Gulf in response to Iran&#x27;s Silkworm missile attack on the Sea Isle City.[8] [9]&quot;<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3ABlack_Monday_(1987)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3ABlack_Monday_(1987)</a><p>&quot;The link at the end, which leads to a story about a VAX machine getting into trouble, might be erroneous. I suggest this because I&#x27;ve seen the story before without the line at the very end linking it to Black Monday (in fact, I always thought the event took place significantly prior to 1987). While it&#x27;s possible that somebody might add this last line to add dramatic emphasis to the story, it&#x27;s unlikely that it would be cut out by somebody - it&#x27;s forms a punchline to the story. Therefore I think the link between this VAX story and Black Monday is probably incorrect.\nNote: the joke link in question (*Alleged computer mishap) was removed 2005-11-05 RaulMiller 00:20, 22 November 2005 (UTC)&quot;",1393106109

7283731,comment,7282475,7282475,9,0,asanwal,,,"Good article.  A few additional things to note:<p>1. Most founders don&#x27;t have to think about hedge funds as a funding source.  They&#x27;re not doing seed/early stage deals.  There are 300-600 private companies that hedge funds track and care about.  It&#x27;s later stage, pre-IPO companies.<p>2. GGV Capital (article author) is a late stage investor so they may compete with hedge funds, but more often than not, hedge funds are providing capital that VCs cannot.  Hedge funds are a much much larger asset class than VCs and VC has been contracting.  So when a VC-backed company needs big $$, VCs need to syndicate and corporates and hedge funds are often jumping into these deals.<p>3.  This trend is going to increase.  As private companies stay private longer, hedge funds and public market investors in general are taking more interest in the private company universe.  And they look at private compnaies as investment targets and as potential disruptors of their public company holdings.<p>4.  Hedge funds are a great deal more data-driven and analytical than their VC cousins.  VC is still very artisinal and instinct driven.  It will be interesting to see how their behavior and approaches influences VCs, if at all, over time. (We sell data to hedge funds investing in private companies and so see how they use data)<p>Notes:<p>1.

7283727,comment,7282704,7283030,2,0,CaptainSwing,,,"Here is the copy/pasted text for those those who cant be fucked with the auto-scrolling website.<p>&quot;They say itâ€™s friendship. We say itâ€™s unwaged work. With every like, chat, tag or poke our subjectivity turns them a profit.They call it sharing. We call it stealing.Weâ€™ve been bound by their terms of service far too longâ€”itâ€™s time for our terms.<p>To demand wages for facebook is to make it visible that our opinions and emotions have all been distorted for a specific function online, and then have been thrown back at us as a model to which we should all conform if we want to be accepted in this society. Our fingertips have become distorted from so much liking, our feelings have gotten lost from so many friendships.<p>Capital had to convince us that it is a natural, unavoidable and even fulfilling activity to make us accept unwaged work. In its turn, the unwaged condition of facebook has been a powerful weapon in reinforcing the common assumption that facebook is not work, thus preventing us from struggling against it. We are seen as users or potential friends, not workers in struggle. We must admit that capital has been very successful in hiding our work.<p>By denying our facebook time a wage while profiting directly from the data it generates and transforming it into an act of friendship, capital has killed many birds with one stone. First of all, it has got a hell of a lot of work almost for free, and it has made sure that we, far from struggling against it, would seek that work as the best thing online.<p>The difficulties and ambiguities in discussing wages for facebook stem from the reduction of wages for facebook to a thing, a lump of money, instead of viewing it as a political perspective. The difference between these two standpoints is enormous. To view wages for facebook as a thing rather than a perspective is to detach the end result of our struggle from the struggle itself and to miss its significance in demystifying and subverting the role to which we have been confined in capitalist society.<p>If we take wages for facebook as a political perspective, we can see that struggling for it is going to produce a revolution in our lives and in our social power. Not only is wages for facebook a revolutionary perspective, but it is a revolutionary perspective from a contemporary viewpoint that points towards class solidarity.<p>It is important to recognize that when we speak of facebook we are not speaking of a job as other jobs, but we are speaking of the most pervasive manipulation, the most subtle and mystified violence that capitalism has recently perpetrated against us. True, under capitalism every worker is manipulated and exploited and his/her relation to capital is totally mystified.<p>The wage gives the impression of a fair deal: you work and you get paid, hence you and your boss are equal; while in reality the wage, rather than paying for the work you do, hides all the unpaid work that goes into profit. But the wage at least recognizes that you are a worker, and you can bargain and struggle around and against the terms and the quantity of that wage, the terms and the quantity of that work.<p>To have a wage means to be part of a social contract, and there is no doubt concerning its meaning: you work, not because you like it, or because it comes naturally to you, but because it is the only condition under which you are allowed to live. But exploited as you might be, You are not that work.<p>To ask for wages for facebook will by itself undermine the expectations society has of us, since these expectationsâ€”the essence of our socializationâ€”are all functional to our wageless condition online. In this sense, it is more apt to compare the struggle of women for wages than the struggle of male workers in the factory for more wages. When we struggle for wages we struggle unambiguously and directly against our social exploitation. We struggle to break capitalâ€™s plan to monetize our friendship, feelings and free time, through which it has been able to maintain its power.<p>Wages for facebook, then, is a revolutionary demand not because by itself it destroys capital, but because it attacks capital and forces it to restructure social relations in terms more favorable to us and consequently more favorable to working class solidarity. In fact, to demand wages for facebook does not mean to say that if we are paid we will continue to do it. It means precisely the opposite.<p>To say that we want money for facebook is the first step towards refusing to do it, because the demand for a wage makes our work visible, which is the most indispensable condition to begin to struggle against it. Against any accusation of â€˜economismâ€™ we should remember that money is capital, i.e. it is the power to command labour.<p>Therefore to reappropriate that money which is the fruit of our labourâ€”and of all our friendsâ€™ labourâ€” means at the same time to undermine capitalâ€™s power to command forced labour from us.<p>And from the viewpoint of work we can ask not one wage but many wages, because we have been forced into many jobs at onceâ€”we also work for google, twitter, microsoft, youtube and countless others. From now on we want money for each moment of it, so that we can refuse some of it and eventually all of it.<p>Wages for facebook is only the beginning, but its message is clear: from now on they have to pay us because as users we do not guarantee anything any longer. We want to call work what is work so that eventually we might rediscover what friendship is.&quot;",1393105001

Just get started on it and do a little bit. I don&#x27;t mean get started on it with the intention to finish it. This is what stops you â€“ fear of <i>actually doing it</i>. So, really, start with the intention to just do a little bit. Tell yourself you&#x27;re just taking some notes, you&#x27;ll stop after 10 minutes. Then, do one of two things: (1) stop and do something else or (2) if you find yourself wrapped up in the work, consider allowing yourself to continue. But you must not think of option (2) when you begin. It&#x27;s not an option.<p>Zizek once said that in order to get himself to write, he needs to to tell himself that he&#x27;s just going to take some notes. One of the most productive critical theorists in the world has procrastination problems too, and he gets over them with self-deception. He also schedules every moment of his life though, so don&#x27;t think one trick is all that&#x27;s required to be at the top of your field.<p>Ultimately, I think finding a way to dodge your anxiety entirely is very important.

7283605,comment,7282618,7282618,3,0,dhughes,,," They way I think about it is you can work a dead end job for 80 hours per week making $8 an hour to make enough to survive and not have any free time to socialize, go to the gym or be with family. Or study for and try to get a decent job you like that pays half decent so you don&#x27;t have to become a human eraser and wear yourself down doing the work of others. Having many skills to fall back on is great but trying to learn everything losing focus and never finishing anything isn&#x27;t much help.<p>Or realize you need to focus and find a career that you like and is wanted by employers. I recall years ago they mentioned &quot;The fear&quot; and it is a great example of suddenly realizing shit I better start getting good at this life thing, now!<p>Time is shorter than you think your health can suddenly rapidly fail, saving for retirement is a constant worry. Time is so short it&#x27;s as if nothing you do can be done soon enough. Realizing that early in life is fantastic. A big part of life I think is having mentors who are examples to follow it&#x27;s good to have a person who you can think &quot;What would Bob do?&quot; as an internal guide.<p>It&#x27;s easy to say all that but hard to do, I haven&#x27;t mastered that yet.",1393103343

You already know you can learn that stuff more easily outside of a classroom, so I would argue that taking that academic path is a waste of both your time and money.<p>Instead, I would consider studying something totally different. Programming is a wild card - you can play it to improve any hand you have.

I find this most visible in the self-portrait, of which the author writes: <i>the man whom one cannot approach easily</i>.<p>The tinge of green in the original portrait makes this man much harder to approach, because it adds the psychotic, unusual aura to the picture. This man has left the world of commonly shared human experience.<p>The author remarks that in the picture <i>The Road Menders</i> the trees have a strange color and after conversion look more solid, giving some depth to the road. So the picture looks more like what we would expect, in other words: we see the usual.<p>But this is contrary to the kind of psychotic perception of the world, which I associate with van Gogh's paintings, at least with those paintings that we would call typical van Gogh (there are paintings from the earlier <i>dutch period</i>, which have a different character): Reality is distorted, colors deviate from the ordinary, everything is flowing together and swirling, the wheat, the sky, the world. Proportions are deranged, look at the painting of his bedroom for example:<p><a href=""http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Vincent_Willem_van_Gogh_137.jpg&filetimestamp=20050519135921"" rel=""nofollow"">http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Vincent_Will...</a><p>Theo van Gogh, his brother, wrote 1889 in a letter to his future wife a characterization of Vincent van Gogh: <i>""As you know, he has broken since a long time with everything what we call convention. The style of his clothes and his behaviour show that this is a special human, and since many years people who see him will say: This is a madman.""</i>",1323691125

I think its more about attitude and approach than the specific way you do things.<p>Our business won two awards for our flexible practices and I believe that the reason we were ahead of the competition was that when the judges visited I was able to point to real results not just reams of HR policies and documents.<p>Founders and early staff really understand that they need to get a lot done and they should also be highly motivated to contribute to the business success. If the business takes the view that it can give people some flexibility in return then this can work out really well.<p>Some of the people who 'need' the flexibility should be founders or part of the key management team. In a startup you have tremendous control over the way your systems and business practices are set up - think about your family needs when doing this. Allow people to find what works for them. One of my cofounders found that she worked best after your children went to sleep and so we got a huge amount done between 9pm and midnight. We built all our systems so people could work from home and told our team that if their kids were sick they could work from home to look after them.

3343236,comment,3341641,3342037,1,0,mss6,,,"""So with that being the case, couldn't this problem be solved? All it will take is a push for bands to stay away from huge labels and for listeners to find that music. That's where Spotify should come in.
What's interesting about this entire thing is that a long tail company like Spotify is potentially able to shift the power from the shit that most major labels produce to better and more meaningful music. If Spotify can find a way to direct people's tastes away from most major label garbage, they might be able to solve this issue.""<p>In response to this there was an older article posted here about some of the numbers behind Spotify: <a href=""http://pansentient.com/2011/04/spotify-technology-some-stats-and-how-spotify-works/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pansentient.com/2011/04/spotify-technology-some-stats...</a>
One quote in particular speaks to your point, interestingly in a section called ""The Short Tail?"":<p>""During a week-long analysis of all music played via Spotify:
88% of track accesses were for the most popular 12% of all tracks on Spotify.
79% of server requests were for the most popular 21% of all tracks on Spotify.""<p>While it might be a nice idea that Spotify could somehow shift user taste towards more independent artists, the numbers here seem to say that people go to Spotify for mainly popular, culturally relevant tracks.  I think a company attempting more of what you're saying is the YC company Earbits with their model focusing on discovery of smaller artists.  Personally I'd rather listen to popular music I know on Spotify, and I think most people feel the same way.  I just wish there was a viable business model there.  Music is a very tough vertical.",1323690259

In fact, the mother is not (and cannot be) legally required even to inform the father that he is a father and can hence give up the child for adoption without the father being able to assert custody.<p>There is no solution to this problem (of equality in parenting for never-married couples) that we as a society can live with, so it is then obvious that fathers cannot be legally or socially equal parents.<p>Now among married couples this comes into play too but differently.  If a woman has an affair and gets pregnant by another man and the husband doesn't find out about it for, say, 3 years, the child is legally his and even if they divorce he may have to support someone else's child.<p>This means that for women, motherhood is both a biological and social fact, but for men fatherhood is purely a social/legal fact.<p>BTW, this also raises interesting issues--- it means that because as men and women can never be equal parents in our society, the ways in which we enforce this also mean that same-sex couples can not be fully equal to opposite-sex couples--- they either end up legally favored or disfavored depending on how presumption of paternity works in a given state.",1323690045

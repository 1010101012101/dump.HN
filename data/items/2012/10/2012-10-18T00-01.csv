This is what I was hoping to get from posting here.<p>We aren't going to hide the fact that other people will write the cards, infact we want to celebrate it. We want the writers of the cards to be a big part of the product. I think that is the only real way to ""short circuit"" the issue. Having written a number of the cards you begin to make the words more interesting, you add little doodles. The people who have received cards so far seem to like it. It's a bit like when the pizza delivery guy draws a unicorn on the box when you put in special request.<p>I am self funding this project right now and there are some typo's in the how it works page. I agree with you 100% that needs to be sorted. We have been live now for a week and the UX stuff is top of the agenda. Our back end is quite robust and seems to be functioning without issue. So thats a good thing.<p>This is MVP 1.0 and in the lean tradition we kinda tried to keep features to the bare bones. If people like the service we are going to develop it as much as possible and make it as simple and fun as possible.<p>Features to be added:
 - Searchable friends yep. 
 - Faster page loads yep
 - Choice of delivery yep<p>Really glad you like it and can see the potential<p>Create better memories :)",1350521336

Group commit to disk is every 1-2 milliseconds.<p>V3 also allows reads to be load balanced across replicas and masters so you gain some additional read capacity from replication. V3 also routes transactions directly to the node with the data so you don't use capacity forwarding transactions inside the cluster.<p>You get to keep transactions to.

4667009,comment,4666043,4666531,5,0,kmavm,,,"Naivete and cynicism are not mutually exclusive. ""If you're not paying, you're not the customer, you're the product,"" is a wonderful example of naive cynicism. It imagines that the only participants in a business transaction with full human agency are buyers and sellers; and that if you are neither buyer nor seller, well, the seller and buyer must view you as the not-quite-human product! This meme explains nothing, and reflects a completely broken view of Facebook's business goals. Its cynicism makes it no less naive.<p>Suppose, for the sake of discussion, that Facebook were a perfectly mercenary, ruthless organization, straight out of HN's collective imagination: it cares <i>nothing</i> about the people using its software, and eats, sleeps, and breathes nothing but monetization. (This view is itself another instance of naive cynicism, but let's grant it to get on with things.) Facebook is still critically reliant on non-paying users continuing to use it; without them, no possible road to monetization exists. Those users are a party to the transaction; they come willingly, and Facebook has no army to compel them to come again tomorrow. Viewing users as inanimate ""product"" that can be manufactured and sold would be stupid; the ""product"" is not something that Facebook produced, bought, manufactured, or otherwise has any proprietary claim over.<p>This relationship is actually pretty close to the relationship that print media have to their readers; your subscription pays for approximately 0% of their revenue; advertisers make newspapers and magazines work. It's also close to broadcast television, where you literally contribute no <i>money</i> to the revenue of the businesses producing programming. It doesn't follow that television studios should view you as inanimate ""product""; indeed, television studios work very hard to produce something that real people enjoy, because without those people freely choosing to watch they are out of business.<p>A much more sensible aphorism would be: ""If you're not paying, you're not the customer, you're the <i>audience</i>."" This has greater explanatory power, for the behavior of free web service, advertisers, and <i>the audience</i>, which is a willing party to this entire transaction, as the ""product"" soundbite obscures.",1350519700

I'm thinking people who can't write by hand might also make for a good market to target.<p>Can't wait to see how things progress!<p>Two quick peevish side-notes:
1) The root domain bfore.me leads to a Heroku error message.
2) The ""How it works"" page needs some proofreading for grammar (and probably worth canvasing the site for any other grammar glitches, too.) I'm only pointing this out because it feels like trust is a major requirement for your users to adopt & there's a direct link between trust and grammar.<p>Two quick UX notes:
1) Searchable friends please...before you even clean up how friends are displayed, make them searchable.
2) This is probably related to me having 50+ tabs open, but does lead to a solution that addresses another issue with the site (page load time): the dashboard was really slow to respond when trying to scroll around. It worked fine for me in a fresh browser, but you probably could still avoid the issue (while reducing HTTP requests and page load time) by generating a sprite of the facebook thumbnails and possibly also the cards.",1350518736

Everything a neuron does it does so with a combination of electrical and chemical signals. This is why it&#x27;s slow, but it also introduces considerable noise in the process.<p>Also, because they&#x27;re usually in some skull-like object, and because neurons are incredibly hard to culture, we simply lack the tools to observe them in their natural environment to the resolution you might want. Simple questions like how often a neural signal fails to cross a synapse in a brain are remarkable difficult to answer. Do we need to know how every neuron is connected to every other neuron in the brain to understand it? Even if we had such a map, would it be missing something so crucial as to be useless (for example how glia interact with the neuron)? Nobody can say for sure right now.",1431021485

For example, certain soils (mainly clays, very fine grained soils) compress and undergo consolidation (i.e. compress downwards) as a function of weight and time. Consolidation, when expected, can be mitigated and/or accelerated to &quot;get it all out&quot; so that there is no differential settlement in the future. For example, this here [1], looks to me like a case of differential settlement that resulted from improper excavation and back filling during original construction. In the case of fault-lines and stochastic motions? It&#x27;s a lot harder to say what can or should be done in a general sense. Luckily the frames of most houses are made of wood, which has more forgiving properties (failing more with more ductility) than masonry. Unfortunately, the exterior shell of some houses are brick, which won&#x27;t be so forgiving as the wood that it surrounds.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1dmt6l/advice_for_jacking_up_a_house/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1dmt6l/advice_for_jack...</a>",1431021414

My business consultant takes me through a lot of different ways of looking at personalities and right now we&#x27;re on Jung.<p>A lot of INTJs hang out here; here are some common INTJ mental tricks:<p>* Holding yourself to a higher standard than those around you<p>* Expecting yourself to make extremely bold, large career moves<p>* Holding yourself to a tighter timeline than you hold others<p>* Expecting yourself to achieve things on an unrealistic timeline<p>As INTJs mature (i.e. through and past midlife), it is common for them:<p>* To learn to make the small, bite-size steps that can help them put their big-picture plans into action<p>* To learn to be easier on themselves<p>An INTJ in the grip of their inferior function (stress, illness, tiredness / exhaustion) will commonly:<p>* Binge on things that indulge their senses (from TV to loud music to porn to food to exercise)<p>* Get zero enjoyment out of the binging<p>* Take an adversarial attitude toward the outer world (so-and-so is plotting against me, etc.)<p>An INTJ can escape this by:<p>* Using their gift for thinking to plan, learn, write, chart, and strategize about ways to escape their unrealistic expectations, currently sub-optimal situation, etc.<p>* Remembering that what others think about you is often a result of that person&#x27;s personality dynamics, rather than whatever you, (the INTJ) think the other person must be thinking about you. For example, if you think an ENFP may be plotting against you because of something he said, that probably says more about your stress levels than it does about the ENFP&#x27;s disposition.<p>A good reference (and not just for INTJs): &quot;Beside Ourselves,&quot; by Quenk.<p>I hope this can be helpful to someone.

I&#x27;ve cobbled something vaguely modal together for bspwm with abuse of shkd, so a lot of the binds map similarly, but like your solution it&#x27;s far from ideal.<p>As for &quot;Why would you want this?&quot; For me, the straightforward answer is &quot;modes are modular&quot;. A core concept in vim is that your input can be thought of as a string describing the edit you wish to make, and modes help me keep that manageable in my head: I can first think about the mode I plan to enter, and then separately what I plan to do under the constraints of that mode. It&#x27;s a little hard to explain, and I&#x27;m sure acolytes of other paradigms have their own philosophies, but it fits in really well to my workflow.<p>It&#x27;s a subtle thing in the limited world of text editing, but I definitely miss the semantics whenever I leave it, whether to a terminal or a browser or whatever.

For example to search for some specific text in the system log using Powershell:<p><pre><code>    Get-EventLog -LogName System | Where {$_.Message -Match &quot;something&quot;}\n</code></pre>\nTo process text as fields, as with awk, one would use the Split method (at least to start off with):<p><pre><code>    Get-EventLog -Log System | Where {$_.Message -Match &quot;something&quot;} | %{ $_.Message.Split()[5,4] }\n</code></pre>\nBut as message text is often parameterised, it may be easier to take advantage of this data to get what you need. For instance, this command would extract the latest machine sleep and wake times from the system log, and calculate the duration:<p><pre><code>    Get-EventLog -Log System -Source Microsoft-Windows-Power-Troubleshooter -InstanceID 1 | Select-Object @{n=&quot;SleepTime&quot;;e={$_.ReplacementStrings[0]}}, @{n=&quot;WakeTime&quot;;e={$_.ReplacementStrings[1]}}, @{n=&quot;SleepDuration&quot;;e={([DateTime]$_.ReplacementStrings[1])-([DateTime]$_.ReplacementStrings[0])}}\n</code></pre>\nOne can also sort and get unique values, just as in Unix-type systems - this command lists all drives defragmented in the past 30 days:<p><pre><code>   Get-EventLog -Log Application -Source Microsoft-Windows-Defrag -InstanceID 258 -After (Get-Date).AddDays(-30) | Select @{n=&quot;Drive&quot;;e={$_.ReplacementStrings[1]}} | Sort Drive | Unique -AsString\n</code></pre>\nSo all the same capabilities are there, and then some.

In general, I bill $x per person:block:day (being each day that I work on something 0-4 hours, and each additional block capped at 4 hours)...  Anything that is not a core part of the product (business logic, or specific design elements) may be abstracted away, reused and/or released as open-source.  I will also use, as appropriate already written open-source code that won&#x27;t elevate the risk of said project (no agpl, only gpl if it&#x27;s a server-side solution).  Once a solution is finished and paid in full, any copyright over the solution will be signed over, and will not include outside libraries, even those written to help with said project.  I emphatically do not believe in Patents on software, so will not apply for or assign any such rights on what I develop.<p>For the most part when you talk to a client openly about how software is assembled and crafted, and that their part of the product will be theirs, and that you will deliver a finished product while also respecting the larger development community in contributing back, it&#x27;s usually a smooth process.  These days we, as software developers, tend to use large amounts of mit/gpl/isc/apache and other openly licensed software/libraries, that when you explain that what&#x27;s out there saves you time, and giving back saves everyone time, it&#x27;s usually less friction.<p>I also expressly do <i>not</i> bid on entire solutions that are not well defined, or are too strictly defined.  It tends to become a time sink if you do.  And prefer to bill in blocks/day against a deposit against the estimated work/time.  I also make clear that what I give is only an estimate, and actual billed blocks may vary depending on changes through the lifecycle of initial development.<p>----<p>As far as a day job... I tend to line-out anything that can be construed as assigning rights of work I do outside of the office on my own time, or Patent assignment.

Haskell is clearly impure in that its laziness is implemented using mutation &quot;behind the scenes&quot;, but it is also taken to have an &quot;observable&quot; semantics where such mutation is invisible and IO is merely an interesting value. This gives it purity [0] according to that degree of observability.<p>I think I&#x27;m having difficulty parsing your interpretation of purity because you&#x27;re moving smoothly between analytic and synthetic judgements of the notion. Agda, as an example, is a system which has a synthetic notion of purity as the &quot;language&quot; is thought to not contain terms which represent effects. Haskell plays a trick where it has, essentially, two sets of semantics. The first shares this property (modulo non-termination, see [0]) and is where most &quot;programming&quot; occurs---here we use monads as a system for constructing terms of the second semantics, IO. The second, IO, semantics are vastly impure.<p>To the degree that this trick is &quot;purity in a language&quot; then purity is becoming a very popular idea. Haskell uses its type system to provide synthetic distinction between the two choices of semantics, but if you use a language lacking that discipline then you can merely call this &quot;isolation of side effecting code&quot; and then nobody will disagree with you.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to call this &quot;purity&quot;, and maybe you don&#x27;t, then I feel you&#x27;re in the minority though you aren&#x27;t without an island to stand on.<p>Frankly, both are sort of an overloading of the term, though.<p>[0] Actually, it gets a lot trickier. It&#x27;s well known that non-termination is an effect and it&#x27;s a little slippery to define Haskell&#x27;s notion of &quot;observability&quot; so as to no longer observe non-termination. I mean &quot;slippery&quot; here to say that it takes some technical finesse and that it tends to go against people&#x27;s intuition a bit more harshly than the rest.",1431019582

It gives me much more time to spend with my family - I know it&#x27;s a cliche, but kids will be gone before you know it so spend time with them while you can. The 4-day work week also gives me much more time (nonlinearly more) to spend on side projects.<p>A few disadvantages: First, I only get paid 80% as much. Second, it took a fair bit of effort at work to set this up; management was supportive, but they&#x27;d rather I worked 100% and it took multiple levels of approval. Third, this basically puts me off the career fast track. Fourth, from a social/cultural point of view, people don&#x27;t really understand working 80% and I find it&#x27;s better not telling people about it (thus the throwaway).

And the numbers of individuals into it are larger that most people realize (consider that 1 in 5 children are sexually abused by the time they reach 18 to know just how large the problem is).<p>Now, maybe certain factors like the potential demand growing for bitcoins would be enough to keep it from being banned.

The Technical Authority had a written mandate, signed off by the CTO and CEO, that his technical suggestions were to be given the same authority as a board level member of staff.<p>The reason why it was successful is that the CTO is no longer a developer, but a board director, and as such should focus on enabling the business through its use of technology, and enabling the techology department by cheerleading its needs to the business - you&#x27;ll need to learn enough of the other business functions so that you can do that job properly, and you&#x27;ll need to be able to give business cases of why you need those extra servers etc.<p>In addition, the Technical Authority wasn&#x27;t disrupted by board level meetings and politics, and could spend more time evaluating technologies, practices, processes, setting standards etc. and they were not really suited to dealing with the non technical stuff a CTO has to.<p>Another big benefit was that it enabled the Technical Authority to keep coding because they loved doing it, and they were very good at it too. The team liked this.<p>The team had a lot of respect for the CTO because they realised that he was pragmatic and knew when to hire to cover his weakness, and when to take a step back and accept that the Technical Authority and the team had collectively made a decision, and that they were in a better position than him to do so.<p>As a general rule though, if you hire someone who disrespects you then you get rid of them. There are very few domains where you&#x27;d have to put up with assholery like that because there are no alternatives. Chances are that if they&#x27;ve got the balls to disrespect the CTO then they&#x27;re likely to be unbearable to the people below and to the side of them.",1431018366

They&#x27;re still facts.<p>You&#x27;re suggesting that the &quot;2 decades of hardware tuning&quot; is equivalent to programming, and that just isn&#x27;t the case. While parents definitely provide instruction, each child&#x27;s brain is fully on its own to program itself. It teaches itself how to make sense of the visual signals it&#x27;s receiving from the retina... no one teaches a child up from down, how shading and colors differ, how to use both eyes in tandem to provide depth perception. It&#x27;s all automatic and &#x27;magical&#x27; in a way, because literally NOTHING you can do as a parent can speed that process up in any meaningful way. The same is true for hearing. You can&#x27;t just upload your current understanding of the world... the closest you can come is by trying to help them along mechanically, by holding them up as they &#x27;walk&#x27; their legs, for instance, but their brain is still figuring it out entirely independently. Showing the child how to move their legs is NOT the equivalent of showing them how to detect orientation using their inner ear, or teaching them how to send impulses to their muscles in the right order and at the right time, or teaching them to predict momentum so that they don&#x27;t just fall on their face.<p>> computer learning is orders of magnitude more effective than human learning<p>The only reason one could even ATTEMPT to make that claim is that a computer&#x27;s learning is something that can be copied digitally. A single machine can&#x27;t even approach the learning abilities of the brain. Computers are so fundamentally different that it&#x27;s not even a fair comparison to the computer... the brain will win every time.<p>> I find it very strange that people leave out the 2 decades of hardware tuning and supervised knowledge building that humans get<p>It&#x27;s because it just isn&#x27;t relevant. Take the most advanced AI available today, slap it in a robot and spend 2 decades raising it. I guarantee it won&#x27;t end up anywhere close to a human in abilities or intelligence.

If I don&#x27;t understand a writer, maybe she is mistaken, or maybe I don&#x27;t understand the nuances enough to use that point.<p>- Outline:> My process usually starts with an outliner now (fargo.io is quite good), but I used to write outlines in notebooks.

In exchange, she sends me her stuff and we absolutely rip each other apart.<p>- Second/third/+ draft:> Sometimes I can nail it with one round of feedback.

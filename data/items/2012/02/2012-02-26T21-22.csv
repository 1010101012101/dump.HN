3636934,story,,,1,0,Mumbler,"Ask HN: How much should founders be earmarking for their salaries?",,"I've been working on my pitch deck and PnL and a lot of feedback (pre-sharing it with angels and VC's) is that I've set the salary for myself and the other founders too high. It's currently at ~$150k, including base + benefits (medical and dental). I've been browbeaten for having it so high, and told it shouldn't be higher than $90k, as an absolute maximum.<p>To put some context into this, this startup is made up of founders in their early 30's, with families, and financial obligations. In addition, while none of us have executed a startup, we all have pedigree in our careers (Microsoft, U.S. military, major global financial firms, and Wall Street bulge bracket banks). Additionally, the product that we're developing is not a commodotized concept, meaning we're not developing another social media site, it's hard science that solves a big problem, with a market size in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Last but not least, we have some initial traction from well known players in the industry.<p>Putting all these factors together, and considering our geographic region (New England, expensive area, not the rural area), are we setting the salaries too high? Should they really be towards the $90k range? Or lower? Or where? Would really appreciate some feedback on this from people with actual experience in getting funded.",1330293510

3636927,comment,3635770,3635770,1,0,bromley,,,"Looks useful - something that my company could use at any rate.  We're currently a customer of geonames's commercial web service.<p>I have a few recommendations for the developer:<p>First, the GMail account restriction sounds odd.  But I'm guessing you can sign up with any Google account?  Lots of people have Google accounts, but don't use GMail...  If you can sign up with a Google account (like you often can with app-engine apps), I'd suggest calling it a Google account, not a GMail account.<p>Second, I think the one-price-for-all-commercial-use is off-putting.  I've already seen a light user talking about the price being expensive for 1 request a day, which perhaps it is, and you suggested that commercial users with low usage requirements should contact you.  Generally speaking I think you want to be making custom deals for the heavy users, not the light ones.  If you want to cater for the light commercial users, you might do better to offer an off-the-shelf package that will appeal to them (whilst being too restrictive for the customers that want heavier usage).<p>I think heavy users would often a) be willing to pay more than $200 a year (which is under $17 a month i.e. very little), and b) be concerned about the fixed price because you wouldn't be able to sustain heavy usage at that low price and so the chances are that you'd want to cut them off for making too many requests.  That's a lose lose situation, when it could easily be a win win (them as a happy heavy customer and you getting more money).<p>I suspect some sort of rate-limit-based subscription pricing or credit-based pay-as-you-go system may be the way forward.  If you used a service like FastSpring you could be taking subscription payments very quickly.  (I recommend FastSpring because we're using them and I think they're great.)<p>I don't want to imply that I know what pricing would make most sense for you - I don't - but I'm pretty confident that the current pricing is a long way from optimal.",1330293333
3636926,comment,3635761,3636162,5,0,tptacek,,,"I don't find this very convincing.<p>If you have an ""above-average product to show off"", the first question any investor is going to ask is, ""how are people liking it?"". If you have a lot of satisfied users, you have traction! If not, having the completed ""above-average"" product does two bad things:<p>(a) it gives the investor an easy ""out"" (""let's work on getting you in front of users and see how that goes""), <i>and</i><p>(b) it creates a signaling problem (""great looking product; no paying users; what's wrong with this idea?"").<p>All that aside, I've done the VC tour a couple times, once in the first bubble and once out of it, and my experience has been that without a thrumming business already built, it's all about your track record. If you've made money for investors recently, they'll pay attention. Otherwise, they'll string you along.<p>Sometimes people get lucky. It's possible to flop 7-7-2. That doesn't mean it's a good idea to go all in on pocket 7-2. Courting investors is tremendously expensive. It probably does make some sense to divert some or all of that effort into building up a business instead.",1330293331
3636925,comment,3634140,3636390,1,0,defen,,,"It really depends on the movie.  I see your point about it sometimes being a lazy way to cover up for poor acting, or just to go for shock value, but consider ""Die Hard"" - the word ""fuck"" (and variations on it) is used 50 times, mostly by John McClane.  I think that helps contribute to the atmosphere of his being a regular guy who's in way over his head, doing his best to survive in an impossible situation.<p>Either way though, I don't think it should be the ratings agency's job to enforce artistic quality.  Either movies that lazily use profanity will fail on their own lack of merit, or they'll succeed; in which case I would argue that the public is getting what it's asking for.<p>Side note: I think it's poor form to lead a comment with ""I know this will get downvoted"" or ""time to burn some karma"" etc.  It comes off as a pretty annoying attempt to psychologically manipulate readers.",1330293274

I'm not arguing for changing the general method by which scientific results are conveyed from an author to the audience (i.e. description of problem, description of approach, description of results, analysis of results and conclusion). It's just that once I've digested your results, I want to analyze them critically, re-use them, integrate them into my work, etc. Publishers should facilitate that.<p>Why can't I easily copy a list of genes from a table in YOUR paper so that I can check if they are present in MY work.

About this time some guy cuts you off in traffic and about flips you and your kids. It is at this point that having these simple rules written down helps. Not only might they help the guy that cuts you off, if he happens to see the wisdom of the book, but they also help us in reflecting on the situation and giving people the benefit of the doubt. What if that guy had a person having a heart attack in the back seat. It may very well change your entire perspective of the situation. I used to think that it was all common sense, until I realized that common sense is not common at all. I also think that there is a lot of wisdom contained in the book. Some of it is very nuanced such as the parable of the king and the servant in that particular parable it has a very nuanced explanation of forgiveness and why it is important. So while it does lay down some very simple laws, there is also a lot of depth that explain grey area situations that many people face.",1330293069

The transformer is super-important, because it isolates the AC line from the output, which is necessary so you don't electrocute yourself on the power supply. AC switching power supplies from tiny cell-phone chargers to big computer supplies are split by the transformer into a primary-side connected to the line, and a secondary side connected to the output. For safety and by law, there can't be any direct electrical connection between the primary and secondary side, so even the voltage feedback control signals need to be isolated with small transformers or optoisolators.

Textile seems to be optimized for producing styled HTML, whereas Markdown tries very hard to make the user forget about the fact that they're using a markup language at all. Even its name suggests that it's meant to be an anti-markup-language markup language.<p>For example, if you use ""pre."" in Textile, you're saying that the text should appear exactly as entered (because HTML ignores whitespace by default). Similarly, class attributes are only meaningful in HTML+CSS. On the other hand, when you indent a code block in Markdown, you're not saying anything about presentation, you're just making the code block look nice in plain text while also making a semantic point that the indented block is computer code. Gruber has consistently vetoed any feature that would make Markdown look less like plain text and more like HTML. You would think it odd if a plain text document contained things like ""pre."" and ""(class)"".<p>This makes it easy to compile Markdown to non-HTML formats like LaTeX and even ODF, which MultiMarkdown does.

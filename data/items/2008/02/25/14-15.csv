Microsoft is still hanging on to some smart people... but the prospect of working with SAP?  I can only imagine that the mere thought would drive them off in droves.",1203951110

I like my sushi done by the Japanese, my Pizza done by the Italians, and my burger done by the Americans. Not because any one of the countries is superior, but because chances are that the Italian will make the best pizza. This does not imply that Italians are better at anything other than making pizza. Just look at their politics...<p>Also note that I'm talking about general trends, so of course you can find companies that contradict the pattern - but overall I stick to my point of view.",1203950082

123086,comment,122972,123049,0,0,mtts,,,"It seems to me you're suggesting that Asians are less capable of producing elegant design than Europeans. Which seems to me fairly racist.<p>It's also not true. Most European companies are not Bang & Olufsen. The products of Philips (a Dutch company), for example, are fairly mediocre as far as their design is concerned. That does not prevent Philips from being a major international electronics manufacturer. The Japanese electronics manufacturer Sony, on the other hand, does in fact do design reasonably well.<p>So I don't think elegant design is a distinctly European virtue. Instead, the reason a lot of cheap Chinese crap is ugly is simply that it's just that - cheap crap. The fact that it's Chinese doesn't have anything to do with it.<p>It's also not true that Asian companies merely copy. At a certain stage during their development they do - that's how the aforementioned Sony started out, for example - but at a certain point they will start engineering their own products, like Sony did in the late 1970s or like Samsung started doing in the 1990s. It stands to reason Chinese companies will also, at some point in the future, begin to create their own products and start to compete with Bang & Olufsen, Philips and Sony.",1203949173

I came across this picture in a recent issue of Motor Trend.

Why isn&#x27;t humane assisted suicide an option considered in this scenario? If I were one of the people who was going to be left to die an excruciating death, all I would want is one syringe with a super potent does of heroin... i.e. enough to slip into a warm coma and then shut down my breathing and nervous system.

8456963,comment,8455063,8456473,0,0,TezzellEnt,,,"My Grandma is slowly losing her hearing - one ear is 100% deaf while her other remaining one is at about 50%. She uses a CapTel speech to text phone with a huge display to understand what is said when people call her. It generally works well, but she only has one in her family room. She struggles to hear especially when there are multiple people speaking and there is background noise. I&#x27;ve learned techniques to improve her comprehension, but it can only go so far (If interested, here&#x27;s a few: make sure you&#x27;re looking at them when talking, speak in a &#x27;deeper tone&#x27;, don&#x27;t rush your words, continually repeat what was said until they understand, etc).<p>Almost everyone in the United States has a phone. If I could download an app that runs this program along with my cousins, and have my Grandma use her &#x27;iPad&#x27; (Nook tablet) to understand, with the assistance of something like Transcense, that would be amazing. By linking several microphones, they may be able to cancel out background noise and only highlight the specific speaker, and that would be a fantastic advance.<p>I&#x27;m wondering what their current state of Transcense&#x27;s speech recognition is, however. From the video, it did see like there were some errors. I&#x27;m sure a deaf user can understand what was meant to be said using context of the conversation, but in a business meeting a misunderstood word can change the whole meaning of the sentence or message. I&#x27;ve used Siri, Dragon Naturally speaking, et al and while they&#x27;re good, they&#x27;re not perfect. Dragon in particular supposedly can be taught and learn the user&#x27;s unique style of speech, so I&#x27;m also curious if Transcence will be going the route of machine learning and NLP.",1413341321

8456925,comment,8454784,8456243,0,0,JamesSwift,,,"I was thinking about this the other day and I decided that fantasy football is the most significant contributing factor in the crazy market share the NFL currently enjoys compared to the other major sports. If not for fantasy football, I don&#x27;t think the NFL would be as overwhelmingly popular compared to the other sports as it is today. Because of fantasy football, nearly every game on television is watchable, because nearly every game has implications to the fantasy-viewer.<p>Of course, a lot of what makes fantasy football compelling to play is derived in part from what makes football compelling as a fan. 16 game seasons mean every game means something. One game a week, all on Sunday (until this dumb Thursday night football BS started), means there is a low overhead to team management. Multiple skill positions and multiple (interesting) ways to score (fantasy) points allows for varying strategies. Add all of those together and you end up with a game that is accessible to the masses, yet engaging and deep enough for those that choose to compete.<p>This is what ultimately holds back the other major fantasy leagues (NHL, NBA, MLB). Daily fantasy sports are a huge win for gaining back some of that market share, so it will be interesting how that affects actual viewership numbers in the future. Personally, I think the NBA is going to gain back some of the ground it has lost since the 90s.",1413340526

8456911,comment,8454464,8456728,0,0,ryanSrich,,,"I actually currently live in The Pearl. I&#x27;ve found that the gap between DC and Portland, in terms of startup culture, is shocking.<p>Here is why I think Portland&#x27;s startup/tech culture is lacking:<p>1.) In DC I had ~12 co-working spaces to choose from. All of which had both bull-pen and dedicated office space. One of the spaces I worked out of had ~10 startups with their own offices, and that was just at the single location in Arlington. At their other 3 locations they had just as many if not more. In Portland I maybe have 2 solid co-working spaces to choose from and as far as I know none of them are supporting any well known startups.<p>2. Meetups in Portland are very low key and don&#x27;t draw very many attendees. I mean check out this meetup in DC[1]. It had close to 900 confirmed attendees. From experience I&#x27;d say at least 70% of those confirmed actually showed up. Portland on the other hand has only 70[2] confirmed attendees for a very similar event.<p>3. There&#x27;s a lack of startup accelerators and incubation in Portland. PIEPDX seems to be the largest (and looks awesome). Nike moved FuleLab to SF this year[4] and everything else that I&#x27;ve researched seems to have closed down. In DC you have 1776[5], Acceleprise[6] and The Fort[7].<p>Perhaps comparing the two isn&#x27;t fair as DC is a larger city. These are simply my observations as a person who has lived in both places.<p>It could also be that I&#x27;m just not looking in the right places. I know startups like Simple, Treehouse and New Relic are all in Portland, I just haven&#x27;t seen any presence from them (be it at meetups or otherwise).<p>To be honest, one of the reasons I love living in Portland is because it&#x27;s tech/startup culture is smaller than other cities. I&#x27;m excited to be part of it&#x27;s growth.<p>• 1. <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/DC-Tech-Meetup/events/154948792/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meetup.com/DC-Tech-Meetup/events/154948792/</a><p>• 2. <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/PDX-Tech/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meetup.com/PDX-Tech/</a><p>• 3. <a href=""http://www.piepdx.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.piepdx.com/</a><p>• 4. <a href=""http://www.nikefuellab.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nikefuellab.com/</a><p>• 5. <a href=""http://1776dc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://1776dc.com/</a><p>• 6. <a href=""http://acceleprise.vc/east-coast/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://acceleprise.vc/east-coast/</a><p>• 7. <a href=""http://fortify.vc/Fortifyventures/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fortify.vc/Fortifyventures/</a><p>p.s. - Let me know if you&#x27;re up for a coffee the next time you&#x27;re in town.

In a growing market with lots of new money coming in, its much easier to win. When growth stops, it becomes much more difficult. The vast majority of remaining players start losing, only the house (and maybe a couple sharks) can win consistently. Assuming a market in continual decline, eventually everyone loses (except the house).<p>Nate Silver devotes a chapter to this in The Signal and the Noise.

8456850,comment,8456178,8456178,0,0,jerf,,,"Check me on this: The TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV will prevent downgrade attacks, yes. However, any &quot;real&quot; SSLv3 connections will still be SSLv3 and still fully vulnerable to the described attack. Downgrading is not a necessary component of the attack, it just increases the number of vulnerable client/server combinations to include those that would normally not be vulnerable due to negotiating TLS1.0+. Therefore, if you are in a position where you truly care about security and the fact the SSLv3 has such an enormous hole in it is unacceptable, you should still be looking at simply turning off SSLv3 as the only acceptable mitigation, even if that does cut some clients off.<p>Yes?<p>(Except please note for the purposes of this question I&#x27;m assuming as a given that cutting off SSLv3 is considered preferable by the entity in question to a very weak SSL negotiation. Whether or not any given entity should have that opinion is a different question; I politely ask that you get into that question elsewhere.)",1413338817

While extensions are often the cause of high memory usage, it&#x27;s not always the case, and immediately blaming extensions makes people accuse Mozilla of passing the buck.<p>If you ever see someone complaining about Firefox&#x27;s memory usage, looking at about:memory is <i>always</i> the first step you should tell them to take. The amount of information can be overwhelming but in extreme cases like this it&#x27;s often fairly obvious what the problem is -- look for the biggest measurement!

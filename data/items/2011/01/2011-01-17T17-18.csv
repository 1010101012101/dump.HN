2112833,comment,2112692,2112692,0,0,onteria,,,"Point 2 is somewhat of a difficult area on my opinion. When looking at programming books, I usually have the following process in mind:<p>* How in depth are the official docs? If you're going to read a book on a language, you need a way to validate the book's contents. How else will you be able to tell the book is not leading you down the wrong learning path? This also gives you a chance to check on if the language is right for you.<p>* How old is the book? If the book is talking about the language 5 years ago, chances are syntax and ways structuring your program (object oriented features may have gotten better for example) have changed. Make sure you have the most up to date edition, and complement it with checking the API docs. Well written API docs will generally indicate if a way of doing something has changed, or will no longer be supported.<p>* Look at the author of the book, and see how close they are to the community of the programming language in question. Are they the creator? Contributor? Someone else?<p>* What is the book trying to achieve? Some great books expect you to have basic knowledge of the language, or some other specific concept (MVC for example). Make sure you know what you're getting into. Some books also act as ""desk references"" that could be potentially replaced by more up to date API docs on the language's website.<p>There's probably much more that can be added to the list, but I think these provide a basic sanity check.",1295286635

We've yet to see a project yet where android outsells iOS. (This very likely has to do with the wonky payment system for Android which started with very few nations and still isn't anywhere near Apple's numbers of participating nations. For Most non-US specific apps, they sell about 50% abroad 50% domestic, so that's a HUGE deal.)<p>The tools have a laughable difference in quality (XCode/InterfaceBuilder used to be a little sketchy for apps, is now pretty good, but eclipse is still eclipse, and graphical layout and editing is still very out there for android, but is the norm for iOS).<p>(I used to be an embedded Linux dev, I really wish android was doing considerably better).<p>That $1289 you'd spend buying a late generation iPod Touch and a white macbook is very worth it (or a mac mini even).",1295284003

We've been in the AppStore for the past 3 Christmas's and have noticed a significant spike each Christmas (30-50%+ increase sales) that doesn't really taper off.  Sure the week between Christmas and New Years has the greatest spike (70%+ spike) but after that it returns to much higher numbers than before Christmas (ie., about 30-50% higher sales).  Surprisingly, these numbers seem to carry on throughout the year until the next Christmas season and then you experience the same spike in sales.  Throughout the year there are some ups and downs but it's pretty steady.  Sure, piracy might have helped his app sales a bit, but he's wrong to discount the fact that the holiday season changes everything in the AppStore and it's effect continues on throughout the year.",1295283978

Sure. I agree. The problem starts, if you mix a lot of clients. Say, I'm using two different OS' (Windows, Linux).

On Linux I'm using ssh (ssh foo@host:port) or scp (scp -P port ..).<p>I certainly CAN manage .ssh/config files and reduce that mental overhead a bit. But my argument is that this makes no sense.

Time-based boundaries like mentioned in the OP are good (""disable Internet access at night""), but I've found that location-based boundaries are also extremely helpful.<p>As an example: no work in the bedroom, <i>ever</i>. This includes reading work email, doing web research, taking work calls, logging into a server, etc. If you have to do something work-related, take it outside. This helps you (and your partner, if you have one) keep good sleep hygiene, and also provides a good barrier to obsessing with work.

What happens to the people who retire in a year like, say, 2007. Their first year of retirement, expecting to withdrawal $50k to live on and instead watch their $625k dwindle down to $460,000. The next year maybe they get lucky and only lose 2%, minus the $50k they withdrew. Now they're down to around $400k. Ok the market picks up and they get a 3% average the next year but took out another $50k. Now they've got $360k. After a mere 3 years of retirement they've used up half their savings. Even if they manage to get 8% a year for the next 30 years, they now only have $28,000 a year to live on. Whoops.<p>The assumption that your money won't run out is not a given. This is the reason it's important to have a LARGE nest egg. While $625k might do it if you could invest it at 8%, you can't count on that and the market could quickly leave you living with your children. To really be safe you're going to need significantly more money than you think you will. You also aren't accounting for inflation, which means as you age either you're going to have to cut your expenses ~3% a year or you're going to have to increase your withdrawls ~3% a year.<p>I don't know what the story is with these retired by 30 people, but I would be willing to bet a fair number of them will find themselves broke and returning to work at some point in their lives.",1361136107

Some areas of focus include miniaturised medical devices, sensors and circuits.<p>Dr Todd, who was trained as an engineer, worked for the institute between December 2010 and May last year and, according to the FT, led a team specialising in a next-generation semiconductor material called gallium nitride (GaN).<p>The material can withstand extreme heat and power levels well beyond the more traditionally used silicon.<p>An external hard drive discovered by Dr Todd's parents in his home after his death contained apparent plans between the institute and Huawei, a Chinese telecoms giant, to develop a device known as a GaN amplifier, which has many commercial uses, the FT said.<p>But the GaN amplifier could also be used in electronic warfare to jam signals and weapons, and to create high-powered radar systems to boost military capabilities, said experts consulted by FT.<p>The involvement of Huawei would be problematic because the firm has been deemed a security risk by governments, the FT said.<p>Last year, a United States government intelligence committee said, after an 11-month investigation, that it suspected communications equipment made by Huawei could be used for spying.<p>The committee's report cited analysts' concerns that Huawei has links to and is influenced by the Chinese government, despite it claiming to be a private company. Huawei has denied these suspicions, although it admitted in a US government report that an internal Communist Party committee does exist within the company, as required by law...<p>According to FT, Dr Todd's parents said that their son had seemed increasingly stressed in the months before his death.<p>""I am being asked to do things with a Chinese company that make me uncomfortable,"" Mrs Todd recalled her son saying.

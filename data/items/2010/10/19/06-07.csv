Apart from the register globals, it says nothing about PHP though.<p>Actually while I won't defend register globals in 2010, back in 1998 (am yes, I wrote PHP code in 1998) when nobody understood web development really (do we even today?) it was a handy feature, that prevented much line noise on pages that were (back then) usually composed of html with a few <? ?> tags and code in between, pretty much the way javascript was on pages until a few years ago. It was only as the php became heavier and was moved in to common include files and later into libraries that the usefulness went away (but the potential issues remained).",1287471118

From their original mission statement, through their huge acquisitions, through their refusal to spin off substantial portions of their company, their approach to competition, etc, etc. If they had been organized differently or if they had been split up into different corporations as a group they'd probably be better off today. Not least because each group would have the freedom to make the choices they need to (free of the MS overarching strategy straight-jacket) and they'd have the motivation to build truly great and disruptive things, rather than the relying on the usual strategy of getting it sorta-kinda right on the nth try through sheer brute force (read: massive investment from Windows/Office profits of the past).<p>P.S.

They had me (a junior programmer albeit with a College degree) building out large parts of their infrastructure, then switching things at the drop of a dime.  (picked up some good skills in the aftermath)<p>There were so many opportunities for me to have left.<p>- When I realized the business plan basically was formulated around a domain name.<p>- When a superior said ""We don't have to build anything new, what people want is one place to get everything and we'll provide it to them"".  (Basically a ""Don't innovate"" directive)<p>- When the investors sued because they contended they company was trying to steal corporate resources (mostly domain names).  (I don't think my boss was, but clearly there was a lack of trust on both sides)<p>- When a superior asked us to all go onto Digg and ""digg down"" people who had taken issue with him for trying to purchase wiki.com for 2 million dollars.<p>Eventually, even the depressed shadow-of-myself left after my boss said ""I'm going to make Bittorrent legal!  The labels will have to accept it because it will be the same as a swap meet"".    I realized the writing was on the wall and I had to get out.  (This was... after 6 months of not getting paid)<p>I left about a month after and had a more interesting startup experience at Soundpedia (didn't work out either, but I have zero regrets and loved every minute of it)<p>I regret that I let my early start on RoR waste away while I was building stuff in PHP and Perl/Mason for them.  (ouch) I regret that I didn't have the courage to try to do something on my own, or to go to the states to try working for a more properly managed startup.  I regret that I didn't have a more social environment (since I was working remotely).  Finally, I regret that I let myself get carried away. It was a classic story of manipulation of a green wild-eyed college kid.  Someone posted a while back about the classic pattern of manipulation in an open source project and my experience fit that to a T.<p>Now when I look back, I can kinda laugh about it all.  I learned, moved on, and I gained a lot of skills after doing so.  Was I stupid? Hell yes; but it's the kind of stupid you can get away with once in your life.<p>Would I work for a startup again?  Absolutely, even if I had no stake in the business.  However, no more remote working, and I won't accept a job where I can't perform excellently.",1287470067

1806391,comment,1806333,1806333,0,0,miyudreams,,,"Actually this is very common in many organizations.  I hear many friends complain about their managers. It's a tough situation to be in. The part where the manager gets all the credit for work you've done, just isn't fair. Sometimes, I've heard good managers tell you to face the situation face on with that ""bad"" manager.  If he/she doesn't change the situation, you go up to his/her manager, etc. However, it's not easy to do that, and how you do it may just make you look bad. Most companies should have feedback and review times, so that should be a good opportunity to raise issues. I think the root of the problem is to screen carefully when hiring the individual.  Make sure the candidate goes through many cases studies properly or even go on a 3 months probation period. I also know big companies usually have leadership conferences or training seminars to keep the employees up to date. I took a course before, and realized I wasn't ready to lead. Not everyone can admit to that, when they have big egos or cocky attitudes. I'm curious to see what you and your buddy are building. Best of luck with your project.",1287469770

1806381,comment,1803809,1805119,0,0,Matt_Cutts,,,"That was probably me. We have two sides to the webspam team at Google: engineering and manual. We definitely prefer to write algorithms so that we avoid dealing with individual websites--the idea is that you strive to fix the root cause of an issue, not to tackle specific sites. However, if we see a website that violates our guidelines and that gets past the algorithms, we are willing to take manual action. Where possible, we use the output of the manual team not only to reduce spam itself, but to train the next iteration of algorithms.<p>For example, one of the big issues in blackhat spam this past year was illegally hacked sites. Our algorithms weren't doing the best job on hacked sites, so the manual team kept an eye out for hacked sites to remove them (and often to alert the website owners that they'd been hacked). The data generated by the manual team helped us build and deploy multiple new algorithms to detect hacked sites, leading to a 90% reduction in the number of hacked sites showing up in Google's search results in the past few months. That decrease in hacked spam in turn frees up the manual team to tackle the next bleeding-edge technique the spammers use.<p>I suspect every major search engine uses similar approaches: try to stop the majority of spam with algorithms, but be willing to take action in the mean time while engineers work to improve the algorithms.",1287469455

1806371,comment,1805839,1806148,0,0,lzw,,,"I really think they should buy ARM.  People say there would be a conflict, but ARM licenses architecture and designs, rather than selling chips, and the existing licensees would surely continue, and there's nothing stopping apple from selling new licenses.  But having the ARM design team available to task for custom designs for apple (to be licensed as well to others, or not) would be worth about $8B, in my opinion.  (given the size of the iOS market already.)<p>The rest of those are bad choices for Apple.  Apple is what it is because it focuses.  I think none of those companies are in Apple's focus.<p>However, Apple could buy Clearwire- Clearwire has very valuable spectrum licenses in the USA.  This might be justified, but since Apple is a global business, it isn't a slam dunk, as whoever controls WiMax spectrum internationally would need to be contended with.  On the third hand, they could use that spectrum to create their own LTE network in the USA, and still have enough spectrum on the side to create a parallel high bandwidth data-only network.<p>Hmmm.... Clearwire's market cap is $1.6B.  They might need to buy sprint too (and then spin out the telecom business) to get full rights to the clearwire spectrum.  (not sure about what the agreement is.)<p>Netflix is a great company with great management.  But the streaming rights won't transfer thru an acquisition, I'm pretty sure.  However, giving netflix a spot in the iTunes ecosystem seems like a good deal, maybe take an equity stake in the process, sure.<p>EA- no need to buy them, balloons headcount, very different business. EA will either put out the apps for Apple's devices, or other companies will beat them to it.  Apple's in a strong position.<p>I'm not sure about Cablevision.<p>I think Apple should buy Adobe, though.  I'm sure they still have some talent left, and owning what's left of the desktop software market would be good for Apple.... but that is a ""mac primacy"" play, and I think Steve and the rest of Apple is focused on iOS exclusively, so I'm sure they won't buy Adobe.<p>PS-- I realize your point was that they have the capital to buy all those companies if they wanted to, but I'm looking at it as a shopping list.<p>I'm pretty certain Apple has plans for the $51B.  They could spend some of it buying back their stock, or as a dividend, but both of those are non-growth company strategies, essentially giving the money to investors and saying they can't manage it well.<p>I think Apple has its eye on some very big opportunities.<p>I think one of those opportunities is putting $10B-$20B into a vertically integrated automated manufacturing facility.<p>They cannot continue to scale their business on the backs of foxconn. At some point, this is becomes the biggest inefficiency, even though Chinese labor is inexpensive, it won't always be, and when it becomes as expensive as korea or singapore or even japan, where will foxconn move?<p>I think pure automation is the solution.  Foxconn needs to be able to build anything, Apple just needs to build the products it desgins.  There is a position to squeeze a lot of cost out.<p>And the other argument?  Apple did it before.  The Macintosh factory was a wonder of its age, and extremely automated. IT was designed along with the macintosh.<p>I think Apple is learning from foxconn, but eventually will need to build their own manufacturing base.  Simply because you cannot keep doubling your device numbers forever.... foxconn will still build a lot of stuff for apple, but I'm waiting for Apple to take over a chunk of it.",1287468806

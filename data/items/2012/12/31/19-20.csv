First, diagnosis is valuable in and of itself.  Second, awareness of a problem shouldn't wait on a solution.  Third, you're basically saying that, for any problem beyond a certain individually-addressable size, just don't talk about it because the author can't do anything about it.  I don't think that's exactly what you meant, but that's what you said.<p>She didn't wound you.  She pointed out that you're bleeding.

4990629,comment,4989340,4990260,3,0,epidemian,,,"LiveScript is more like a functional sugar coat over JS, so it preserves most JS core semantics. Especially strict evaluation and duck typing. Because of that, i think it is much easier to do the conversion from the JS world to LiveScript, and viceversa.<p>Introducing Laziness, pureness and static typing into the JS world is a much bigger challenge. I'd <i>love</i> to see some of these efforts take off; especially Elm, which is even more ambitious, as it not only provides a safer alternative to JS, but also to the DOM model and HTML altogether.<p>The biggest problem i see these projects facing is the abstraction gap. As the abstraction over JS/DOM that they provide is much bigger than, say, CoffeeScript of LiveScript, when that abstraction breaks and you have to dig into the generated JS/DOM world, it's very painful. And this is a necessary pain every time things don't work as expected and you need to debug in the browser. I think that for these projects to be successful efforts like source maps are crucially important. But for projects as ambitious as Fay or Elm, i think we need even better debugging tools; some environment where we can debug <i>entirely within the abstraction layer</i> that these languages provide, and make the cases where you have to resort back to JS much more uncommon.",1356983869

4990619,comment,4989412,4989412,2,0,jballanc,,,"If you allow me a small anecdote... I used to live in Manhattan. Occasionally, I would go to the store to get paper towels or toiletpaper and buy the bulk-size. Invariably, the package would be too big to fit in the small plastic bags that were available and carrying it along with everything else was rather awkward. Last year I moved to Turkey, and one of the first things that I noticed is that all of the bulk-size packages of paper towels and toiletpaper have built in carrying straps.<p>Now, this may seem like a very, very minor thing (and it's not unique to Turkey). On it's own it says nothing, but the longer I've been away from the US, the more and more I've noticed just these sorts of little things. It's the sum total of these ""little things"" that indicate to me that the US has, on a very fundamental level, <i>stopped innovating</i>.<p>Oh, sure, the US will continue to produce new things. It'll probably even produce one or two <i>big</i> new things in the next couple years, but it's not the big things that drive the innovative spirit. Gather enough smart people in one place, give them enough time and enough money, and you're pretty much guaranteed to get a major innovation (or, at least a driverless car).<p>You'll also waste an enormous amount of resources. A society that is innovative at its core has only to foster that innovation, in any small way, to get a far greater return on investment. In short: America has a tremendous head start, but America has become complacent. The ""next big thing"" just might come from somewhere where the people are still hungry.",1356983699

4990611,comment,4986790,4988369,1,0,vidarh,,,"Yes. I bought my house when the UK market was still booming, and sellers were used to houses going substantially over the advertised price. Instead we negotiated 10% off the advertised price, and I don't think we did particularly well even though the estate agent we dealt with seemed rather shocked to get an offer that low. In terms of picking the area, we did well - current value has increased at least 10% more than the average for London in the time since we bought.<p>We could likely have started lower, and we messed it up by using some repairs that needed to be done (that were clearly priced into the advertised price) as an argument for dropping the price when we ought to have been able to get that price drop <i>and</i> make the offer contingent on the seller having some of the repairs done on their dime.<p>The key thing is to be able to move quickly. They picked us because the alternative would have been to wait for other offers, while we turned around and started negotiating as soon as we were sure, offer an agreement in principle subject to a survey right off the bat if they could meet our price, had an agreement in principle from my bank, and had been renting so we stressed that we could move on everything immediately.<p>If you can stress to the sellers estate agent in particular that you can move quickly, keep in mind that it will be in their interest to get a quick, trouble free sale vs. hanging on for weeks for 10% more commission, and that will influence how they deal with their client (conversely, it is in your interest whether selling or buying to be very wary when an estate agent pushes you to accept an offer - there's been some survey where it turned out estate agents typically hold out longer and sell for more when selling their own houses than their clients do).",1356983627

I had a streak of bad luck that left me with an unimpressive resume and made it incredibly difficult for me to get hired, even though objectively I was/am very good at making companies money.<p>In my case it came down to the realization that the standards people use to judge your skills are very arbitrary. Once I went out and got a few certificates I started getting job offers. Nobody cared about the fact that I was smart enough to learn SAS in two weeks or make my previous employers large sums of money, they only cared about the fact that I had the certificate. C'est la vie.<p>In every industry there's some sort of bar past which people start treating you like a real person. Getting past this bar often has little to do with merit-think having a degree  from a ""prestigious"" college or having exceedingly specific previous experience. Try to figure out what that bar is in the field you want to work in and how you can show that you've cleared it. Programming is a diverse field but a few bars I've seen people use (not saying I agree with these) are ""has experience in Ruby/Python/Functional Programming/my favorite language"", ""has contributed significantly to open source"", ""recommended by someone I know who is competent"", and so on.<p>The last one is IMO the most valuable bar to clear.

I went to school at UT Austin, which as you might imagine, has a nontrivial number of these companies recruiting. However, my takeaways from these companies:<p>- You'll most likely be working in Houston / San Antonio (probably not where you want to be working)<p>- They pay well by general, non-tech, new grad standards, but don't expect the ""standard"" 100K salary + 50K signing bonus + 30K/year stock that's become standard fare in the Valley. That said, the cost of living in Texas is significantly lower than the Valley (plus, no state income tax!), so you might come out ahead here.<p>- Not a ton of startups in the space, due to the large amount of capital required. You're basically working for the big guys. This means that there isn't much upside. WYSIWYG, you aren't going to become an overnight millionaire.<p>- Culture is much more corporate than Valley companies. So don't expect free food / drink / laundry / massages / gym memberships / rail passes. And you may have to wear clothing other than jeans + flipflops to work.<p>Major companies in this space recruiting CS people: Valero, Schlumberger, ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66.<p>All the above said, there are some pretty cool technical challenges that these companies face. Where do you drill? How do you analyze seismic data to figure out on a macro level where to explore? What about when you start drilling and find oil, what's the best way to extract it? These companies have massive quantities of data gathered from sensors as they're drilling / exploring, and they need to crunch through it to minimize waste and maximize the possibility of hitting large amounts of easily extractable oil. The oil/gas space is definitely gratifying from a solving-real-problems-instead-of-social-media-BS perspective.",1356982104

Facebook's product is a straight social media business. However, if advertising was your primary source of income, you were in the same business: selling advertising. I will also grant that because of their product model, there is an implicit level of trust that is easily violated. This implicit trust is not as big of an issue for content companies, because the reader isn't trusting you with the gory details of their life on a day-to-day basis.<p>I learned enough in my time as a direct marketer to know that advertisers don't buy advertising on impulse. They buy it based on some criteria. That criteria can be really simple, like vertical alignment, or it can be more subtle. Vertical alignment is simple: E.g., I'm selling phones, so I want to advertise on a gadget website. Easy, but you can't build a business on easy alone.<p>A more subtle case is when an advertiser wants to target a demographic. Anyone with advertising inventory must go through some effort to identify <i>who</i> their inventory is comprised of. You're selling views, but views by <i>whom</i>? That is the question that advertisers must answer before they can buy, except in simplistic cases mentioned above.<p>This means that anyone in the business of advertising must have some means of identifying their readership. This is the same kind of private information that people fear Facebook is building and leveraging. The more targeted this information, the higher the premium one can charge to advertisers. The difference is that Facebook's product is a funnel for the information that drives their business.<p>As usual, matters are not black & white, but business like the ones you founded are on the same spectrum as companies like Facebook. I know that can be hard to see from the inside. You're looking around you, and you're feeling out the context. You're probably thinking, there's no way my business is in any way similar to what Facebook is doing. From a product perspective, I'd agree, but from a business perspective, it's not all that dissimilar.<p>EDIT: My post didn't even touch on the topic of list sharing and marketing ""partners"", because I don't want to be accusatory. I have no idea if you ever engaged in those practices, and they're becoming less common, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.",1356981856

It's like parallel processing. As I said, I don't really even have the language for this particular ability.

Just have them sit with people from the team and talk about the stuff they'll be working on. If they get fired up and start spouting solutions to the types of problems offered, you very quickly see what kind of developer they are. If they're suggesting something you've already tried, that's a good sign. If they already know the pit falls you've encountered before you mention them, that's also a good sign.<p>What it comes down to is that the engineers are better suited to evaluate engineers. Obviously, you've got to have final say as leader of the company, but the engineers are your best asset here. This is why good VC's always have a luminarie in their back pocket to send out to evaluate tech before an investment.

Even if one grants that not much innovative has happened since the iphone was released in 2007, and other comments have already falsified this claim, 2007 really isn't <i>that</i> long ago.  We're talking about an event that completely changed the way people interact with mobile devices and consume content.  A seismic shift that resulted in the rise (Apple) and fall (Nokia/RIM/Sony) of empires.  How often do we expect that to happen?  When did it last happen before 2007?<p>As anyone here can attest, innovation is hard -- <i>really</i> hard.  I'm a nobody and I see this firsthand in my daily life.  I've been working on a side-project for years that I hope will change the world and planned on building a proof of concept prototype last weekend.  I expected to be done with the prototype in 2 days.  It took over a week.  A quarter of the way through construction, the code for the prototype just kept getting more and more complicated and kludegy, even though I thought I had designed it well enough to be straightforward.  Although, I eventually had to redesign the whole thing, the final design ended up being much better and more reusable than the original POC I had planned.  I was fortunate enough to be in a position where I could spend time to rethink the design.  There were plenty of stories in 2012 to blog about where products were released half-baked because they were released too early.<p>I suspect we will see many interesting things in 2013, much of which has been incubated and polished during the time that Michael thought nothing was happening.",1356980453

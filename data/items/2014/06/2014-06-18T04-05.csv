I have one username on Facebook, another on Instagram, third on Slingshot - with the same company. That&#x27;s why Twitter is my identity. Google+ is a mess, too. Twitter is identity and people protect and advertise their identity. All these others are recyclables. Tomorrow this can shut down and nobody will care. I&#x27;m surprised Facebook hasn&#x27;t learned this. You can&#x27;t even mention a username - it often finds the wrong people in the mentions, not even people who are friends. With Twitter, identity is solid. Anyway, maybe I&#x27;m pissed off as I missed to capture my username, but this doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m wrong. :)",1403067229

7908562,comment,7905676,7908478,5,0,patio11,,,"I&#x27;m not ordinarily a fan of per-seat pricing but I think it makes sense in this environment, as software adoption will be top-down, the sales process is high-touch, they can build it into per-employee overhead, etc.  I&#x27;d caution you that, as you likely know, employee turnover in this industry is <i>insane</i> and as a result of that and standard staffing practices the seats in use are going to fluctuate constantly.  This isn&#x27;t totally dissimilar to CS, so you might look at what ZenDesk and the ilk do with regards to floating seats, etc.<p>If you&#x27;re really getting X0% to Y00% in per-collector productivity then I say start by asking for for $100 per seat per month, if you&#x27;re wedded to per-seat pricing.  You can price anchor it around &quot;less than a single collector-day&quot; and that leaves plenty on the table for your clients.  I&#x27;d then start walking the price up (if it is worth $100 a collector it is probably worth $150/$200/$250) until you start losing lots of sales on the pricing question.<p>If you&#x27;ve got very heterogenous clients number of people on the phones might not capture value as well.  You might consider doing N tiers (maybe or maybe not publicly disclosed).  I&#x27;d be thinking something along the lines of $500 for the mom&pop shops, $2.5k for &quot;real businesses&quot; doing debt collection, and $10k++ custom pricing for large/enterprise accounts.  You could have multiple segmentation levers between plans, such as e.g. size of the average receivable, total volume of receivables, type of collection, what data sources you pull in to do the calculations (&quot;Pay more get more!&quot;), etc.<p>The great thing about high-touch sales is that if you hate how your pricing strategy interacts with any one client you just change it for the next one.<p>If you&#x27;d like to discuss this in more detail non-publicly, email me.  I have a weird personal interest in this field and am happy to trade informal consulting on SaaS pricing for war stories.",1403066716

I worked for one large company where the market cap went to a 1/10th of what the company has spent on acquisitions alone during the CEO&#x27;s reign and a continuous sequence of questionable business decisions that included laying off pretty much anyone who could have been instrumental in helping the company recover.  I think there are many other examples.<p>A CEO can always blame the economy, blame the market, blame the weather, blame their predecessors or otherwise spin things in a favorable way.  They can sell a story of tough times needed to make a turnaround.  Sometimes there will be some secret scratching behind the back (I&#x27;m on your board, you&#x27;re on my board).  There&#x27;s the cognitive dissonance on the board side of things, we&#x27;ve selected this guy therefore he must be good. etc.<p>As others have said, the incentives are set in a way that a CEO looks primarly after his own interests.

Unfortunately that doesn&#x27;t look like it will be the case.<p>Some significant problems the project is experiencing:<p>-F-35 can&#x27;t fly in poor weather because it doesn&#x27;t have adequate protection against lightning strikes\n-Stealth coating doesn&#x27;t sufficiently withstand temperature around the exhausts\n-Exhaust gas is too hot for amphibious ship decks for the Marine Corps variant\n-Rear visibility is poor, and 3D helmet designed to address that shortcoming isn&#x27;t ready yet\n-Onboard software is severely flawed and behind schedule.<p>This program is already wildly over budget and is only going to continue exceeding its budget as they address the multitude of issues it has right now.<p>The whole point of this aircraft was that it was supposed to be cheaper and more versatile than the F-22.  The unit cost is already going to be well over $100 million and that&#x27;s with the assumption that our allies will buy a large number of them.  Chances are several allies are going to drop out, and I suspect we are going to dramatically cut back the number we acquire as well, thereby driving up the unit cost.<p>On top of that, it is becoming increasing unlikely it will perform as billed.  Not to mention that from day 1 the F-35 concept was ill-suited for the close air support role.<p>The US military would be far better off cutting its losses now and starting from scratch to develop a light strike fighter for the Air Force, a close air support attack aircraft to replace the A-10, maybe an interceptor for the Navy, and scrapping the Marine Corps variant altogether.

The whole vicious circle of greed never has a happy ending. In most cases, the inability to be happy is a mental problem, which separates the miserable mass from the blissful few.

I subscribe to the thought that nothing is 100% secure, so I would recommend to put as many layers as possible. In my opinion, the issue you should be concerned about is the effectiveness of whatever solutions (layers) you implement. I think it is being accepted by the industry that detection and prevention methodologies based on predefined data (signatures, rules, etc) are only as strong as said predefined data. In layman&#x27;s terms, it will probably protect you from most unsophisticated attackers, but that&#x27;s it. Today&#x27;s most sophisticated attacks are one-off (0day) and/or custom, so they probably won&#x27;t be defined. In this regard, some of the newer generation security solutions are developing / using smarter detection and protection methodologies (real time adaptive models vice defined positive and / or negative models).

There will always be a tension between cheap-and-fast vs expensive-and-precise.<p>I&#x27;ve spent my career doing this stuff. I&#x27;m telling you, it is not trivial. It is being worked on, but you can&#x27;t just strap a missile onto a drone and call it good.<p>A piece of context I left out. I don&#x27;t want to kill people. Yes, despite working on war machines. I ain&#x27;t tossing out cheap, disposable, optimized for operational cost out there, because that means you are, eventually, killing children and other innocents. No thanks. We aren&#x27;t talking &#x27;cool robotics here&#x27;. We are talking corpses, burned bodies, melted faces, families broken, futures destroyed, blood, pain, horror. There are no words for it. I worked on this stuff because I consider the alternative to be worse, but it&#x27;s ambiguous.  I&#x27;ll spare you the &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; speech, as I&#x27;m sure you get what I mean.<p>&quot;Move fast and break things&quot; is a great way to build a Facebook. Not so much for war machines, IMO. Feel free to chalk that up to trying to preserve a career, but it&#x27;s not (you, ansible, didn&#x27;t say that, someone else did). It&#x27;s the realization that everyday, when you go to work, you are designing something to cause unbelievable misery, often for political rather than ethical reasons. It&#x27;s hard to live with. I&#x27;m not denying that there is politics and all of that other stuff happening, it certainly does, but it is not the only thing going on.<p>Sorry, I realize this is a downer for HN, where we are supposed to be chipper, enthusiastic, and supportive, but we <i>are</i> talking about killing people here. It&#x27;s not a situation for being &#x27;disruptive&#x27; or whatever SV meme you might think of (again, you didn&#x27;t use that term, I&#x27;m responding more to the thread at large).<p>Given all of that, is there room for innovation? Sure. And it is being worked on. I&#x27;ve worked on next-gen autonomous robots and UAVs for war. You may or may not read about it some day. But it ain&#x27;t easy. Another poster brought up the IUD analogy. Sure, if you blanket the sky with fire you can take down a modern US jet. And kill everything else as &#x27;collateral damage&#x27;. I don&#x27;t want to fight war that way, and I don&#x27;t think we ever should, except perhaps in extremis. Because at that point we have lost whatever it means to be human.<p>Sorry, I think about this stuff. A lot.<p>edit: a big reason for the expensive airframes and other weaponry is <i>because</i> we decided we don&#x27;t want to carpet bomb and otherwise use non-precision weapons. Spend a million and hit the window where the target is sitting, vs 50K to drop a bunch of bombs that destroy a city block.

So, not saying Facebook has no utility. Yes, we know it serves a purpose for a lot of people. Clearly.<p>><i>it has allowed me to stay in touch with family and friends who I otherwise would probably speak to more rarely.</i><p>Yes, we also know that&#x27;s the number one use case, which serves as Facebook&#x27;s crowning contribution to humanity. I won&#x27;t argue what it means to you or anyone else personally. I do think it replaces more meaningful interaction with a relatively superficial pub/sub model. I also believe that it isolates people and I am aware of studies which have indicated the same.

But, really, I am objecting more to this never-ending devaluing of relationships by Facebook whose motive is  to capture your social activity (relationships) by any means necessary, irrespective of the actual value-add (or subtract)  to those relationships.<p>Of course we all know that their purpose is to make money. I wasn&#x27;t dropping that as a great revelation.

There was a steep learning curve for me personally, especially because at the time I was starting out the documentation wasn&#x27;t very good. (It is amazing now, though!)<p>I also like React a lot but it only deals with the view layer, it doesn&#x27;t give you any structure for the bigger picture of things. I guess this is something that Flux addresses but I haven&#x27;t looked into it.<p>I did briefly look into integrating React to be used as Ember&#x27;s view layer but decided to drop it since HTMLbars looked like it was around the corner (hah). It is still pretty easy to use React with Ember now, though it feels hacky because you end up having to call forceUpdate a lot. I wrote a post about how it works here: <a href=""http://discuss.emberjs.com/t/can-reactjs-be-used-as-a-view-within-emberjs/3470/10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://discuss.emberjs.com/t/can-reactjs-be-used-as-a-view-w...</a>",1403064425

But here it goes.<p>I have a service which identifies which accounts will pay for accounts receivable. IE: collections agencies. Numbers\nshow it can move the needle double to triple digits depending on the account mix.<p>Right now, I&#x27;m planning on a per seat monthly subscription.\nCustomers know how much they&#x27;ll be charged each month, and I think it lets me focus on the value rather than community unit costs.<p>EDIT: Just a note, unfortunately, this is a very high touch environment. The upshot being that once a customer chooses you, they <i>never</i> leave. Even if they&#x27;re being outright abused. (I have stories!)",1403064381
7908477,comment,7907734,7907734,2,0,LukeB_UK,,,"For me, deleting my LinkedIn account was one of the best things I&#x27;ve done. I only ever recieved spam from recruiters, endorsements for skills I don&#x27;t have from people who don&#x27;t really know and invites to connect with people that I worked with and are in a different industry. None of this meant anything to me so it was just an annoyance.<p>Couple all that with LinkedIn&#x27;s constant use of dark patterns and general bad practices, I think I&#x27;m way better off without it.<p>Unfortunately they are in a position where a lot of people signed up and won&#x27;t move to an alternative unless their contacts are there too, much like Facebook. It&#x27;s embedded.<p>Since deleting my LinkedIn profile, I&#x27;ve mainly used twitter for networking. Within the development community it seems to be a great place for people to share all the stuff that people would share on LinkedIn anyway.",1403064373

That&#x27;s what you are seeing with the W-8BEN.<p>For selling stuff across borders, source of income is where ownership changes hands from seller to buyer. If the buyer owns the item as soon as it goes into a DHL pouch in Canada, then it is Canadian-source income and the US can&#x27;t tax it.",1403064282

For instance, an image format with such a bug would allow you to implement a heartbleed-like attack on a user&#x27;s browser by displaying a malicious image and then reading back the pixel values. That would be very, very bad.<p>But I can believe that your statement applies to formats used by games for their own assets, where those assets come directly from the game developer.",1403064251

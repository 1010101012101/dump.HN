10288344,comment,10284028,10285852,0,0,monopolemagnet,,,"You missed the boat and went off on a strawman fallacy based on a fundamental misunderstanding: Microsoft OS code and libraries, are implemented not <i>just</i> in C/C++/some asm but are also implemented in CLR languages.  All that legacy crap in a variety of languages is a huge attack surface.  Demanding pointing to closed source proof is an impossible, specious fools&#x27; errand.<p>Have you ever done any Windows NT kernel driver development?  Compared to OS X (xnu) kexts or Linux, it&#x27;s a disaster.  XNU and Linux extensions are also not that great because it follows the same, flawed insecure methodology of allowing kernel extensions to modify the kernel, which OpenBSD wisely eliminated.<p>The other strawman you raise, trying put the wrong words in my mouth, rewriting a massive legacy codebase does not throw everything away.  The lessons learned are the most important.  Instead, OS and app virtualization can be used to run prior OS/apps while new apps can run in a new environment, sharing a filesystem as needed.  That doesn&#x27;t start over &quot;from scratch, with inexperienced people&quot;, which is <i>your</i> incorrect presumption because that would be foolish.  Otherwise, the Microsoft ecosystem will continue to accrue technical debt and job security which can never be paid off, because it&#x27;s stuck in 1993.<p>The kernel should be the kernel.. a tiny, mostly immutable thing which does just enough to provide process/thread isolation, IPC and such.  Even better is <i>capabilities-granted</i> privilege requests to perform <i>unsafe</i> operations, so that drivers are demoted to least-privilege processes.  QNX and MINIX loosely follow this, and it&#x27;s a far more secure <i>and</i> robust benefits of reasonable microkernel architecture approaches.",1443398270

10288342,comment,10287913,10288147,0,0,bordercases,,,"I think you might be overestimating the role emotions and identity play in maintaining the integrity of a system of epistemic statements. There are structural reasons beyond simply how much I like my ideas or other incentives to keep my ideas that make scientific reasoning hard. Devoid of emotion and human nature concerns, we still end up with optimization problems which feel fuzzy because they&#x27;re fuzzy, not because there&#x27;s anything clouding our vision.<p>The epicycle models that dominated cosmology&#x27;s explanations of orbits comes to mind, if only because it&#x27;s a good example that is obvious enough in hindsight as to be uncontroversial. Epicycles carry such strong descriptive power that it does make sense to add more epicycles if you&#x27;re merely trying to explain your data. But because epicycles don&#x27;t require information from gravitation, it feels like crackpottery to introduce such information even if it results in a simple model.<p>Another example that&#x27;s more obviously structural is building set theory without any notion of self-reflective statements. Russell&#x27;s paradox undid the first iteration of set theory despite that system being quite descriptive.<p>If you built a whole system of thought on a powerful, incorrect statement, you&#x27;re fooling yourself but it&#x27;s understandable.<p>I can&#x27;t evaluate it well enough to say if it&#x27;s true, but some crackpots are coming up with models of black whole phenomena without event horizons, based on a similar problem as epicycles might of had. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll say because I think I&#x27;ve exhausted the controversy I can put into one post. :)",1443398230

Funny you would say that SIP looks like it comes from the telcos, when the whole aim with SIP was to create just the opposite.  H.323 has often been accused of being created by telcos, too.  Truth is, folks from the traditional enterprise voice equipment makers shaped both.<p>SIP was adopted by 3GPP in 1999 to be used in the mobile networks.  Of course, that trickled throughout the telcos, so it now is widely used in the telco space.  H.323 was widely used for PSTN backhauling to reduce tolls.  However, SIP is more prevalent there, I&#x27;d guess.<p>Enterprise networks still use both H.323 and SIP, with more desk phones using SIP and videoconferencing equipment split, but moving to SIP.<p>That said, any move to SIP these days is only because there is nothing better.  WebRTC is the next big thing. It borrows SDP from SIP, but no signaling protocol is defined.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d like to realize the vision behind what was intended to be H.325, which was to be a JSON-based signalling protocol that is fully distributed.  Each application could implement whatever protocol it wanted, and they would all be associated through H.325, giving the user the feeling that these different applications work closely together.  That would be possible, even when applications run on different devices.<p>Alas, there seems to be no financial motivator for those that control the market to explore that concept, so we&#x27;re stuck with H.323, SIP, and WebRTC (and various proprietary glue pieces).  The trend these days seems to be toward proprietary solutions, providing limited interop with others through SIP.  Limited, as in nothing but basic voice and video.",1443396475

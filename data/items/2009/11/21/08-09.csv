Then you can make you're own decision as to whether YC's logic makes sense or not.",1258793698

954363,comment,953727,953727,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Nate Silver is right. This says absolutely nothing about global warming itself. It says something about how scientific research and academia work.<p>They are in a gold rush. As long as the climate change debate remains top of the agenda the money will keep on coming. Securing continued funding for their projects is the main and sometimes only concern of scientists. At least that is what I conclude from many years of working with them.<p>They are funded by politicians and other sources that will dry up once the global global warming hype ends. What politicians need is a clear and unambiguous picture that speaks truth beyond reasonable doubt. That's what politicians will pay climate scientists for and that's what they are struggling so hard to deliver.<p>All this is completely without connection to the question of climate change proper.",1258793252

I think if PG comes to some one year startup and says ""Hi, I wanna be in Ur company for 5%"" nobody will throw him out. But now for U it is not about that fact that U want him in Ur company, but about Ur pride about Ur ""child"" (meaning Ur all heart investment for the last year).<p>I can't give U an advice, U have to know by Urself how much Ur pride is worth to U. I still would take the deal but would make clear that I didn't take it because of the money.<p>But I can give an advice to the YC guys: Don't bring new creteria into a deal U nearly have closed. New creteria are for deals that U can't close without some new leverage.<p>All of that includes the assumption that I have all information nessesary about the deal. But actually, nobody has but the topic creator and the YC guys. So, don't take my words too seriously!",1258793247

954347,story,,,25,14,david,"Dynamic Pricing: Let your prices rise or fall until you maximize revenue","http://informationarchitects.jp/dynamic-pricing-for-digital-goods/ ","I think this idea has potential.<p>Most freelancers/consultants know the prevailing advice for pricing you're work is to start your hourly rate off with an educated guess, based on the minimum income you need to maintain your standard of living, and how much value you think you can provide. Then, whenever you feel like you're not getting enough work, lower your rates, and when you start getting more work than you can handle, raise your rates until you're comfortable again.<p>This way, you can utilize the constant feedback of the market to ensure you're always maximizing you're revenue, given you're current abilities, marketing, and market/economic climate.<p>Doing the same for you're web service/digital products is simple enough it could even be automated. What do you think, would you price your services this way?",1258791640

954341,comment,952511,953180,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Daniel, you say: ""At the minimum I would support the open and free release of all unaltered data.""<p>If i may extract quote from the message you replied to: <i>As you know, I have refused to send McIntyre the ""derived"" model data he requests,</i> since all of the primary model data necessary to replicate our results are freely available to him. <i>I will continue to refuse such data requests in the future. Nor will I provide McIntyre with computer programs, email correspondence, etc. I feel very strongly about these issues. We should not be coerced by the scientific equivalent of a playground bully. I will be consulting LLNL's Legal Affairs Office in order to determine how the DOE and LLNL should respond to any FOI requests that we receive from McIntyre.""</i> (emphasis added by me)<p>I do agree with you that transparency is the litmus test of good science. At the same time, catering to that can lay you open to abuses from, well, trolls.<p>As an analogy, suppose I had a bee in my bonnet about Linux security and I kept demanding that Linus send me copies of his binaries every time he did a new commit. He would rightly tell me to get the sources and build it myself and leave him alone. and in turn I could post lonely rants along the lines of 'why won't Linus Torvalds come clean about Linux security'. It would be quite meaningless, but it would sucker in some people. If I was sufficiently clever I could probably get quoted by someone at Microsoft or in the BSD camp.<p>The parallel I am drawing here is to the public datasets and methods laid out in published, peer-reviewed papers. If McIntyre is so sure that either the methods or the datasets are flawed, why not follow the established practice of writing to the journal and challenging the paper, or even submitting his own analysis of the public data and explaining how it improves on existing analyses? Instead he posts in some minor journal which is not part of the scientific corpus, not a hard science journal, and has been widely accused of lax publication criteria.<p>One of the things that really bothers me about the skeptical crowd (as opposed to individual skeptics) is that they employ a lot of same kind of arguments as the proponents of 'intelligent design' do, claiming there's an ivory-tower conspiracy that silences all dissenting views and shuts them out of publication. Any time you have a bunch of people going 'OMG teh conspiracy', it's time to whip out the old bullshit detector...and all too often, comparing their claims with the published literature sends the BS detector way into the red.",1258790978
954340,comment,954121,954121,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Part of the problem with doing this in the US is that cardiac surgery and cardiac care is a major revenue center for US hospitals.  US hospitals are law bound to treat patients who come in their Emergency Rooms, regardless of ability to pay. So, they lose money on patients who are uninsured or under-insured and need expensive care, and then they make up the difference doing expensive cardiac procedures, OB, orthopedic surgery, etc...<p>There is a growing move to go to specialized hospitals like Heart Hospitals, Surgery Centers or stand alone OB centers in the US, because they are big revenue generators for the owners of those specialty hospitals.  But, while I'm sure quality goes up at dedicated heart hospitals, it causes problems on the macro scale, because those specialized hospitals drain patients with private insurance that would otherwise be subsidizing patients without insurance at a general hospital.<p>If you read between the lines of the article, what they don't say is they are charging cash up front for many of those surgeries.  Families with children needing heart surgery that don't have insurance are forced to either pay cash or their child likely dies an early death.  It sounds like the are actually turning patients away that don't have the money to pay for their surgery.  You can't do that in the US.",1258790953

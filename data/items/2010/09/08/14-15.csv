I really respect Joel for<p>a) treating his programmers well<p>b) not taking external funding for something that doesn't actually require (I suspect points a and b are connected too).<p>but writing a bug tracking system in ASP.NET seems a lot less\nintellectually challenging compare to what's involved in a high frequency trading system (even if you don't get to use Erlang, Haskell, OCaml and C++ -- and you frequently <i>do</i>). Of course that's also nothing compared to many Silicon Valley companies (you get to work on hard problems <i>and</i> you're in a place where core competency is software). I'd imagine, this is related to his point about Stanford (or any other Bay Area school for that matter, even San Jose State): if given other choices, graduates will tend to work on projects that are more interesting or ""hard-core"" (to borrow a phrase Joel himself has used in terms of of what sort of he experience he looks for on people's resumes).<p>(Edit: Had a point about GPA, but since others are talking about this, I'll remove it. That said, does Joel (or anyone else) have any hard data on this, in a statistically significant sample?)",1283957921

I would be biased in this case and suggest Python. But there are other languages that will suit you just as well - Java, Ruby, PHP and so on.<p>The above would be enough to get you going and write your web games.<p>Then later on I would recommend:<p>CSS - To style your web pages.<p>Javascript - To add more interactivity/functionality to the browser.<p>SQL - Initially you can just use plain text files or simple key-value stores that most languages have bindings for (I'm thinking of the shelve module in Python for example).

Thus far I was working on £10k / year on advertising which consisted of Google adwords, social media and niche print advertising market mix. I was also going to promote it directly via presentations to my contacts but I had not priced that time as I can do that while still doing my consulting role (at least initially, and if it goes well I can hire some sales guys).<p>I am concerned about what glenngillen says regarding the perception issue. Security products are expensive: e.g a few competitors such as Archer (<a href=""http://bit.ly/9Z7Xyq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/9Z7Xyq</a>), RSAM (<a href=""http://bit.ly/cSjzDz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/cSjzDz</a>) and riskwatch (<a href=""http://bit.ly/bhlzYY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/bhlzYY</a>) are well over $10K per year for most companies.<p>If I price at £20/m is it too low and will it be percieved as ""cheap"" and non ""enterprise"" or will I be able to undercut the competition and appeal to the smaller merchants who still needs security software for PCI-DSS level 1 and 2 compliance?",1283955773

Moreover, kids whose parents struggle to make ends meet can have the perfect environment to grow created by their parents.<p>It's my observation that you can't judge if someone will be good, or not on the basis of what lies on the surface. You need to truly understand the struggles of the person in front of you to make that decision.<p>So, as a rule of thumb I would pick someone who has struggled more in life vs. someone who hasn't felt the world crash around them.]",1283955217

You mention 100k people in reference to one particular occasion at one particular school. They mention 50k people and don't mention the same occasion, even though they mention the same school. They mention a mob mentality, the closest you have is ""flash-mob deals,"" whatever that means. You mention the importance of a vibrant college town, they say nothing of the sort. You talk about other services likely to pop up. They focus just on Campus Dibs. They mention alumni, you don't.<p>What exactly do you feel they plagiarized?

It's definitely not word-for-word, and while the concept is the same, I'm not sure that proves anything.<p>Aside from whether they did plagiarize your article, there's pretty much nothing you can do. Even if they had cut and pasted your article verbatim, I doubt you could do much other than maybe email some other bloggers with an axe to grind against TC and see if they'd throw some gas on the fire for you.

Dynamical systems inspire computer graphics, Mobius bands inspire carburetor belt design, category theory inspires Haskell...

For another, it&#x27;s almost impossible to measure the risk of American airline travel today, because fatalities are so rare that it&#x27;s no longer possible to turn them into a meaningful number.

With actual numbers, you risk your valuation being objectively quantified rather than via hype, pro-forma speculation or traffic. Far fewer of these projects succeed, but when they do, they are likely to be the ones making the news.</i>",1378741224

6354082,comment,6353780,6353780,3,0,reikonomusha,,,"I&#x27;ve had both good and bad experiences contracting.<p>Good Experiences:<p>* Variety of work. I&#x27;ve done contracting work from writing sophisticated parsers to financial computations to high-precision arithmetic libraries.<p>* The pay can often be better. Dollar for dollar, I&#x27;ve made as much as 75% more by contracts.<p>* If you&#x27;re an excellent worker, you can develop many good connections.<p>* Contract work can sometimes lead to very good full-time positions. Sometimes known as &quot;contract-to-hire&quot;, an employer might decide they want to keep you on board. (Unfortunately, your pay will almost surely decrease in exchange for stability.)<p>* Often you can work in the comfort of your own home on mostly your own time. Usually you&#x27;re under no obligation to work a specific set of hours during the day at a specific location. All of my contract work has been remote.<p>Bad Experiences:<p>* Often don&#x27;t feel a part of the company you&#x27;re working for. Often feel excluded.<p>* Time tracking (if hourly based, which it often is) is annoying. Some services make this a lot easier, but it&#x27;s still a pain to clock in and clock out every single time.<p>* Short to medium term contracting means you need to constantly be on the lookout for work. This, in turn, means you need to dedicate a good portion of your time applying for places and seeing who wants you.<p>* (In the USA) Have to deal with taxes. You might be getting paid $X but you must remember to reserve a portion of that to pay off later.<p>* Typically no benefits, like health insurance. This may be less of an issue outside of the USA.<p>* Not all employers are as nice as they seem. I have had my contract work terminated a month early because I finished a month ahead of time. They said I had no other work I could do to bill them for. Depending on where you live, a month of unexpected loss of life support can mean a lot. For me personally, it about drained what I saved up during the term.<p>* Short term contract work can sometimes look poor on your resume/CV. Even though any reasonable person understands what contract work is, seeing many companies on one&#x27;s resume can often give the impression of lack of loyalty and lack of determination.<p>The Bottom Line<p>For me personally, I prefer full-time work, only because it is much more stable and I don&#x27;t have to seek out work later. If you have significant delays between contract, and depending on where you live, your money supply starts depleting fast. While it&#x27;s enticing to get paid, say, $6000 a month, if you have a 3 month delay between contracts, and each month you have $3000 in expenses, then your effective annual income is decreased by $9,000.",1378741086

Nikcub has provided an excellent summary of the technical detail of the situation (which I will be relaying to many of my friends).<p>There is a huge amount of ignorance in Australia regarding broadband policy. I enjoy talking to people about the NBN, and I came to suspect that no-one in my sample payed any tax. Or they are just really bad at accounting.<p>Very, very few Australians would/should actually trade the cost of connecting their premise for the speed upgrade from ADSL2+ to fiber (edit: which is in the range of about $2k/person or $8k for a 4 person family unit according to the back of my nearest envelope). There aren&#x27;t enough uses for speeds >=1MBps. A typical household is YouTube, Skype, gaming (and I don&#x27;t think a fibre has any special implications on gaming that ADSL2+ doesn&#x27;t have) and downloading stuff illegally.<p>There are more important research/infrastructure projects than a broadband network. Basically anything transit related for a country like Australia - the money could easily have gone into public transport.<p>I was stuck in a situation where I could only get dial-up speeds in a rental property. My theory was that Telstra (the local owner of all the network infrastructure) weren&#x27;t going to invest in any upgrades that would be wiped out by federal spending - but the upgrade wasn&#x27;t going to be for years. 12 months on mobile broadband is very, very unpleasant if you are a heavy Internet user.

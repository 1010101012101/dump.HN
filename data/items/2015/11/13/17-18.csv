People don&#x27;t like &quot;conversing&quot; and &quot;engaging&quot; with brands. That&#x27;s why social media doesn&#x27;t work. Social media is supposed to be social and not commercial.<p>As the article said, it&#x27;s low cognitive involvement that works best, not brand loyalty. That&#x27;s why advertisers are using the Low Attention Processing Model.[1] With this particular advertising strategy, brand information is &#x27;acquired&#x27; at low and even zero attention levels using implicit learning.[2] Implicit learning cannot analyse or re-interpret anything. The information goes directly to the subconscious mind.<p>If so, then we are silently influenced by ambient images and messages around us. Advertisers could be affecting our decision making and even outlook on life in ways we can&#x27;t perceive. This has been the driving inspiration for these posters I designed: <a href=""http://subliminalzen.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://subliminalzen.com</a>.<p>Essentially, if anyone is going to advertise to my subconscious mind, it&#x27;s going to be me.

Assuming this becomes law, you can imagine that someone who landed a robot on the moon, and recovered water from the regolith, would be in a position to make a pretty profit selling that water to the first humans that land for an extended stay. Then there is the whole colonizing thing, if you live there and raise crops (see the reference in The Martian) international law recognizes a colonizing right.<p>So for the last 250 years this has been a joke because nobody could actually go to the moon for an extended stay, but that will change, perhaps sooner than many people think.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/3snvnx/us_congress_legalizes_asteroid_mining/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/3snvnx/us_congress_l...</a>",1447437196

The proliferation of this data, by means legal, or gray, in addition to black, threatens a broad and diverse swath of those who have... less than perfect statistics.<p>Not just in health care, but in general, I&#x27;ve observed a lot of apathy towards security because corporations and large institutions serve a very significant role in <i>diluting responsibility</i> and repercussions.

I know I&#x27;m biased because I&#x27;ve been in Boston for quite some time (it&#x27;s probably different elsewhere), but all of the colleges in the area have been spending money on completely non-academic things.  Building elaborate new dorms & cafeterias, immaculate landscaping, bringing in various pop stars for campus events.  None of it moves the needle on &quot;education&quot;, but it for damn sure enriches the colleges.<p>Speaking for my own alma mater, they spent $8m/year to lure the president away from a California school, because he&#x27;s apparently very good at luring in sponsorships/donations from alumni (I never really understood WTF that meant).  Then the college paid ~$10m for him to have a house in the &quot;hip&quot; part of the city.  On top of that, the university spent many millions building new dorms with sushi bars and excellent views.<p>The costs rose a steady 4-5% a year while I was there, and I believe it&#x27;s been at that clip for decades now.  Sure, you can make the argument that it&#x27;s to pay for their investments, but remember that the university also received in the neighborhood of $100m to rename an existing building on campus.  And of course don&#x27;t forget the monthly phone calls to solicit donations &quot;for the students of tomorrow&quot;.<p>Unfortunately I think that the idea of everyone feeling that they are &quot;above average&quot; feeds into this--kids who can&#x27;t afford it really, really want to go to this school.  And subsidized loans make it very possible for people to borrow $65k a year to do it.  It&#x27;s a vicious cycle, because as prices rise, the more it seems that politicians want to make it easier for kids to go to any college they want to.  Unfortunately I don&#x27;t really know of a good way to stop people from making dumb decisions.  There aren&#x27;t many careers that can pay off $150-$200k in loans in any reasonable amount of time, and I&#x27;m not sure that it would work out well for the government to step in and say that you can&#x27;t borrow more than $X for college from any source.",1447436898

Seizure law is either State or Federal.<p>> If that&#x27;s usually the case, why wasn&#x27;t Bob arrested? In your scenario, he had illegal drugs in his possession, so an arrest seems more appropriate than a simple seizure.<p>Bob usually is arrested. Bob often pleas out, rats out his friends and is not charged, or occasionally is arrested and not charged because the DAs office is overworked as it is. The civil forfeiture is entirely separate from the criminal proceedings. I agree though: for example, the young man that was on the train a while back who had a large amount of money on his person should not have had it seized. That was absurdly bogus. But, as far as I can tell, that was an anomaly.<p>> Lets say Bill, who is unbanked, wants to buy a car. He saved the money for it in cash under his mattress, and now has $3000. He&#x27;s transporting it, and a cop pulls him over, thinks &quot;CASH == DRUG MONEY&quot; and seizes it.<p>First, Bill would have to have drugs on him<i></i>, at least in the State of Oregon, and most states. That is what constitutes &quot;prohibited conduct&quot; under the seizure statutes. Also, having a bank account does not matter. This is a civil case, so Bill would just appear in court and prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the money is not from drugs.

A judge would then order his money returned. It is that simple.

I guess you can argue that keeping proceeds of drug dealing is alright - usually it is cocaine, heroin, and meth - but this all feels very tin-foil-hatty from the perspective of someone who reviews civil forfeitures every day.

We’re very well aware that nobody likes them. On the back-end we have everything to eliminate them from the search results. We cannot implement this functionality on the front-end yet for various reasons.<p>Job seekers, we are sympathetic with all of you and are committed to making your lives easier. For example, you won’t see “great” stealth mode start-ups or established companies that are too “shy” to disclose their name. We require all job posters to publish their company name. Thus, no confidential or anonymous companies; you will know who you’re sending your resume to.<p>As well, we realize that employers need to be educated. Eventually we’re going to fix the problem with employers not posting pay rate, posting junk ads, programming assignments, tests and insane interviews and we may go as far as outlawing third-party agencies.<p>At this stage we’re still in start-up mode and cannot be picky as far as job posters are concerned but our ultimate goals are above. Please, take a look at our site and apply for a job if you need one. And we would appreciate technical feedback again, especially how our site looks on tiny and huge screens.<p>UK and Canadian employers, we’re giving free jobs to promote our business in your countries. Please, sign up and we’ll give you as many free jobs as you want. There’s nothing to lose. Worst case - you’ll waste a bit of your time. Best case - you’ll get a couple of resumes.<p>Have a great weekend, everyone!",1447435381

Since we do inventory optimization, Lokad does not have the obvious conflict of interest that Google would have, but other than that, the degree of technicality involved is not dissimilar to what you would expect from managing an AdWords account.<p>A few salient elements:\n- the Lokad team is, by far, the No1 user group of our own software.\n- client discussion typically starts by defining relatively open goals.\n- we &quot;negotiate&quot; a lot of the business trade-off with the clients.\n- the client may almost never touch the app if only to download results.<p>We are not consultingware, the app is multi-tenant and fairly packaged.

Unless you try hard to actually <i>be</i> one of the unethical higher-ups carrying out bad larger-scale agendas, then in virtually any mode of employment, you&#x27;ll be acting equally as ethically, in terms of your own personal daily actions.<p>But I do think that part of an individual&#x27;s duty to act ethically involves accounting for whatever others might do with the output of your labor. If I write software and don&#x27;t do anything unethical all day, but I <i>know</i> that my boss will use it to cheat on emissions testing, then every time I don&#x27;t quit my job or blow a whistle, I <i>am</i> being unethical, directly.<p>I doubt this applies to many people in their day to day jobs though, since they are not aware of how their labor products are being aggregated for less ethical purposes. So whatever job those folks are doing, whether it&#x27;s performing free dental work to orphans in a third-world slum, or writing some code for a big bank, the degree to which those individuals are &quot;being ethical&quot; is about the same, certainly not different enough to make some big hand wavy guffaw about how bad banking or finance is compared to the rest of industry.<p>Maybe there can be outliers, like someone who not only donates labor to the third world, but also thinks about it in an effective altruism way to make sure that the by-product of that donated labor doesn&#x27;t end up contributing to something bad in some counter-intuitive microeconomic way that is hard to think about when we&#x27;re all consumed with the warm fuzzies of thinking about third-world labor donation. Or a pre-school teacher that is not tied into really any management hierarchy that could possibly be extracting anything from the teacher&#x27;s labor output for some other, unethical purpose.<p>But I think we&#x27;d all agree that these modes of employment are exceptionally rare. Clearly even if every single labor market participant wanted such a job, only a small fraction could physically get them. We&#x27;d still need people doing all kinds of ethical-for-them-in-the-day-to-day-but-unethical-in-terms-of-its-aggregated-affect-on-society jobs.",1447434902

The USDA even published guides on this.  They have a low-cost and a moderate-cost (which is probably still low-cost relative to many peoples&#x27; budgets) plan.<p>A big issue often left out of these discussions is that it is also very time consuming to eat healthily if you don&#x27;t have lots of money to spend.  If you have the time to cook from scratch, you can make healthy food cheaply.  Finding time to cook from scratch is difficult for a lot of people, though, especially people working multiple jobs, or single parents raising kids and also working.  If you&#x27;re starting with raw veggies and dry beans, you&#x27;re realistically looking at an hour or more of prep and cook time, plus cleanup.  If you stop at McDonalds, you&#x27;re looking at 5 minutes.  :\<p>Another big issue is that a lot of people are honestly pretty bad cooks.  It&#x27;s hard to convince your kids to eat healthy food if you consistently make it taste bad, which is exceedingly likely if you&#x27;re trying to cook &quot;healthy&quot; by cutting out most salt and fat.  Hooray for dry baked chicken breasts and steamed vegetables.<p>All of this adds up.

E.g. cops find a DNA match between a suspect and skin cells found under a murder victim&#x27;s fingernails under circumstances where it is clear she tried to fight off her attacker. Does that &quot;prove&quot; guilt? No, it proves that under similar circumstances, guilty is highly likely. The problem is not that the justice system is statistical. That&#x27;s unavoidable. The problem is the unfortunate confluence of the low standard of proof (&quot;more likely than not&quot; versus &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;) combined with the high ratio of illegal versus legal reasons for carrying large amounts of cash (<i>i.e.</i> a high prior odds ratio).",1447434325

Electing people is allocating labor and incurring production costs without evaluating demand signals. It is ideas that must be debated and voted on, and have people fill in to execute them. Only by having information on what policy is desired will you able to properly apportion the production costs and allocate the representative labor in fulfilling said policy. Otherwise you suffer from principal-agent problems in having to trust proxies to execute their ideas, with the proxies you are capable of electing being highly limited in their ideological diversity by result of optimizing for the wrong information.",1447434301
10560883,comment,10556731,10560753,0,0,digikata,,,"The flip side of that argument is that the top xx% people and organizations have accumulated so much wealth that they really don&#x27;t know how to allocate it sanely. As soon as some channel opens to receive it (government or private), money starts flooding in, eroding the integrity of that investment channel - and stupid investments inevitably get made. Meanwhile, people can&#x27;t afford houses or pay for college because the price of their labor is being systematically minimized to increase shareholder value, and the world and national economy as a whole are showing a low-growth stagnation.<p>The question is often asked, what intrinsic reason is there to worry about income inequality? One reason is that when wealth is more evenly spread, the millions of micro-allocation decisions by many people help power a very efficient engine of capitalism. However, if the wealth is unevenly spread, then we have much fewer parties making very heavyweight allocation decisions, and many much smaller allocations being made by everyone else. Under that scenario, the engine of capitalism starts to drop in efficiency because it&#x27;s choking on too high a amount of misrouted investments in some areas, and not enough in others.",1447434284

We use graphite now and are happy with it, but I think having a single database handling logs, events and metrics data would be much more ideal.

You are not &quot;making shit up&quot; by printing more that 15 digits of a floating-point number. Floats, doubles, etc. have precise values. As I said in another comment, the double represented by the literal `0.1` is precisely 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625; similarly, `0.2` is precisely 0.200000000000000011102230246251565404236316680908203125 and `0.3` is precisely 0.299999999999999988897769753748434595763683319091796875. From these exact values, you can see why `0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3` – the left hand side is greater than 0.3 while the right hand side is smaller than 0.3. Printing only 15 digits is not doing programmers any favors: even though `0.1 + 0.2` will print as &quot;0.3&quot;, that just makes the lie even worse – they will be even more confused when `0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3` even though both values print identically.",1447434128

10560868,comment,10559724,10559724,0,0,Fezzik,,,"Ugh, so much misinformation. Having lurked here for a while HN seems to think civil forfeiture is the boogie man. To clarify a few things, at least on the county level:<p>1) There are always drugs when property is seized this way. I review every single civil forfeiture in a rather large county, and the affidavits officers submit read something like: &quot;I stopped Bob after an informant purchased a large amount of heroin from Bob, Bob had syringes, heroin, weed, a scale for weighing drugs etc... on his person, and a rolled up wade of bills&quot;. The money is then seized as proceeds of prohibited conduct.<p>2) IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO CONTEST A CIVIL FORFEITURE. The defendant is given a single piece of paper, that is insanely easy to understand, and simply has to sign the paper saying the forfeited property is not proceeds of a crime. They then have to appear in court, before a judge, and demonstrate this fact. The bar is not high, but I have never once seen this happen.<p>3) The money does not all go directly to the seizing agency. Much of it goes towards drugs programs, oversight for civil forfeitures, and other programs. See, for example: <a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/131A.360"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/131A.360</a><p>Perhaps at the federal level things work very differently and the process is abused, but every time I see these articles it really feels like an anomaly of a story is used to paint an entire program as being demonic, with little to no data to back up the conclusion.<p>edited for clarity, the statutory language is &quot;prohibited conduct&quot; not &quot;criminal activity&quot;",1447434062

I am lost as to where I should start. I want to have a fundamental, intuitive understanding of it.<p>To clarify, I would not consider it shameful to start at whatever level necessary (even the lowest, if required).",1202064995

Fog Creek has had good responses [1] doing this, and it's something that we're considering at Darkened Sky. The downside is that we would need to maintain our own inventory, which would get costly, as well as potentially wasted if we move to a new design, but have a lot of of the old shirts already printed.<p>SpreadShirt actually looks decent, but I'd love to see a blog order a shirt from each of these services, and then write up their experiences.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html</a>",1202063324

I don't think it is.<p>What makes investors successful, is the same thing that makes startups successful:  Figuring out a pattern that works.<p>What YC is doing is betting that lots of small investments in hackepreneur types is better than what VCs and other early-stage investors are doing.<p>Also, I don't see much evidence of them ""desperately trying to prove themselves"".  Looks like they're doing what any smart investment group should do:  Trying to attract great entrepreneurs that they think they can help.

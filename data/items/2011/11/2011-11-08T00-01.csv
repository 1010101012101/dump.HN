3208973,comment,3208422,3208941,1,0,Alex3917,,,"""How can we measure the 'soul' of a lesson, and what happens when a lesson lacks 'soul'?""<p>A good proxy would be just looking at whether something was made by an artist, or a committee. E.g. Feynman's lectures were those of an artist, whereas most textbooks are created by a committee. (And then they get someone with a PhD to add their name as the author after the fact.) It's clear to me that Kahn's lessons are more in the style of the typical textbook, rather than in the style of someone like Feynman. You can't measure it, that's the point. If you could measure it then that's the first sign that something is wrong.<p>""But I guess since they are the highest castes, they are the ones who's mysticism we should adopt.""<p>I'm not advocating the hindu model per se, only using them as an example of a society where schooling is framed in terms of a larger model... In their case one that includes work, marriage, wisdom seeking, preparation for death, etc. It's not clear to me that this is the right approach for western society, but I do think it's worth looking at for inspiration.",1320713995

Working hard may be necessary but it falls far short of sufficient.

Rather, a better educated populace increases the wealth of society enabling us to spend more on programs for the poor.<p>Furthermore, the game may be rigged against poor students, but it isn't rigged by the rich. It's rigged by the teachers unions. Some schools that serve poor children have the highest per-student budgets in the nation (see: DC). But they still perform abysmally. Rich parents have the free time to browbeat administrators of low-performing schools until things change. Poor parents are too busy trying to make ends meet. Their children are stuck with whatever the bureaucracy gives them.<p>This is why school choice programs have displayed promising performance in many low-income areas. They allow students to escape quagmires of union-driven mediocrity. It's interesting that you would want to get rid of the best chance for poor children to get a good education! The DC opportunity scholarship fund increased high school graduation rates by 20% by sending poor kids to private schools. That's a big deal - having a high school diploma substantially increases lifetime earnings.<p>True to form, the unions killed the DC Opportunity Scholarship fund after only a few years of operation. It's hard to make change for the benefit of the poor!

However, it is the qualities (value neutral) of the parenting that determines outcome rather than the richness of the environment. To quote Paul Tough, who gives a good summary of the research:<p>""The disadvantages that poverty imposes on children aren't primarily about material goods. True, every poor child would benefit from having more books in his home and more nutritious food to eat (and money certainly makes it easier to carry out a program of concerted cultivation). But the real advantages that middle-class children gain come from more elusive processes: the language that their parents use, the attitudes toward life that they convey. However you measure child-rearing, middle-class parents tend to do it differently than poor parents; and the path they follow in turn tends to give their children an array of advantages. As Lareau points out, kids from poor families might be nicer, they might be happier, they might be more polite; but in countless ways, the manner in which they are raised puts them at a disadvantage in the measures that count in contemporary American society.""",1320712960

For more than twenty years now, all public schools anywhere in the state offer open enrollment to all students anywhere in the state, up to the limits of the capacity of each school district to receive students.<p><a href=""http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/Academic_Excellence/School_Choice/Public_School_Choice/Open_Enrollment/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/Academic_Excellence/School_...</a><p>So if students don't like what is on offer in their local school district, they can shop around, and take their state funding with them, by trying out another school district's offerings of courses and teachers (and classmates). More students enrolled means more state funding, so school districts make efforts to provide attractive programs that will bring students across district lines. This competition among school districts has promoted innovation in programs and resulted in a fair amount of interchange among students who live in different neighborhoods. School districts compete with one another by offeringprograms for fine-arts-inclined students, or students who desire language immersion programs (Spanish immersion and Chinese immersion programs are both hot programs in Minnesota), and students with many other characteristics. Some school districts gain almost half of their enrollment from open enrollment, and correspondingly some of the historically worst school districts in Minnesota have lost large percentages of enrollment to families crossing district boundaries to look for better schools. (Minnesota also has a huge number of charter schools, which is a distinct form of competition for publicly subsidized students, but they cannot offer some of the programs that public school districts can.) This competition keeps all districts accountable for providing a good learning environment, and helps change the psychology of teachers and principals dealing with families from one of treating learners as a burden to one of treating learners as an opportunity to be grateful for.<p>Any other state in the United States could do the same, and a few already have.<p><a href=""http://educateiowa.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=649&Itemid=636"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educateiowa.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task...</a><p><a href=""http://www.ecs.org/html/offsite.asp?document=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eecs%2Eorg%2FOpenEnrollmentDatabase"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ecs.org/html/offsite.asp?document=http%3A%2F%2Fww...</a><p><i>abolishing private schools</i><p>Abolishing private schools is a distinctly bad idea (as shown by the example of the Netherlands, where multiple kinds of schools receive public funding on a per-capita basis) and anyway is unconstitutional in the United States.

The evidence that having connections helps you get ahead is legion. Who is right?<p>I've always thought that you got ahead by hard work, even while I spent most of my life being lazy. I didn't turn in home work or pay attention in high school; I couldn't afford college because I wasn't a protected class (unlike my best friend) and my parents simultaneously made too much money and had too many kids to pay it; and I scraped by as an adult, always being able to declare exempt on my taxes. But I knew that if I had really wanted to, I could have done something. Even the college thing was just an excuse.<p>Finally, when I was 25 I decided to work really hard. Within a couple years I was able to get a programming job, and a couple years after that I was making 90k. You can say all day long that it's an anecdote, but seriously, the only luck involved is superficial.

It's kind of a 'point system' we use to allocate finite resources.<p>I do think that this is a very important concept that is very difficult for many people to grasp.<p>If you took 50% of each person's money on the planet and burned it in a fire prices would (eventually) drop by 50% on most products.<p>If everyone has less money, they buy less things, and so there is a surplus of things.  This causes the price of things to drop so that an equilibrium is reached.  It will also (ideally) cause a drop in wages, etc so that things are still distributed.<p>The purchasing power of your money depends on the amount of resources to be allocated and the amount of money the people that want the resource are willing to spend.<p>So if banks hoard money, it really does not effect your purchasing power negatively until someone tries to spend that money on resources you want.<p>This is the basic concept, it doesn't mean that there are no consequences to these actions.

Perhaps you should verify your assumptions. Perhaps what really matters for accumulating wealth is the modeling of attitudes and virtues from an existing wealthy set of parents. Much the same way that watching a movie of a famous piano player won't help you play the piano, but working day-to-day with one might, perhaps all this structural, fact-based education actually misses the point of how wealth really accumulates? Perhaps wealth generation is actually more of a learned art, not an applied science.

Long-frame means that resources are given to people who will produce the most with them in the future (i.e. we invest in people whose short-term performance may be mediocre). Short-frame meritocracy is pragmatic and efficient in the context of a static time-frame, but doesn't produce growth or social justice in the long run. Resources (VC funding, jobs, educational opportunities) are allocated to those who don't need them. Long-frame meritocracy is fairer and more productive in the long run but much harder to implement because it requires a certain foresight.<p>Most business decisions are made in the context of short-frame meritocracy. People aren't hired based on what they might become in 5 years, but based on what they're likely to be doing in 3 months.

Likewise for Android (I think). 
BlackBerry's got reader software baked-in, but you'd never find it organically (why is the easiest way to get it open through BBM's <i>Scan a Group Barcode</i> option?).<p>In the time it took to do that, a user could have just typed the URL in, and known exactly what would happen. I'm on a BlackBerry, and even though I know how to run my QR reader, it's still easier and quicker for me to just type it in manually.<p>Similarly, it often seems the people who design posters/ads that feature QR codes have no concept of how you'd scan them - if there's a code on a billboard that's three stories up a building, there's no way my camera will pick that up. Conversely, if the ad is a subway poster (which I'll never be more than 3ft from), you don't need a 4ft diagram.<p>The marketer in me (and everyone) loves them because they allow metrics down to the individual poster/magazine edition, and make it easy - in theory - to jump from something physical to something online. Actual users don't care about them, because there's no perceived increase in value or convenience over the tried-and-true-and-well-understood method of just Googling the product name.",1320710585

It could be that the parents who would send their kids to preschool (regardless of socioeconomic background) are the kind of parents who give their kids the skills needed to succeed later in life. There are tons of confounding variables when it comes to stuff like this, so the jump from ""preschool is a good predictor of life success"" to ""we should invest more in preschools"" isn't necessarily a logical one. Correlation does not imply causation, and all that.",1320710583

I find it odd that Preferences is a tab versus its own dialog. I shouldn't need to access it that often, so I don't think it merits the same visual prominence as my library or playlists.<p>2. If you stick with the all-in-one window approach, it seems  like you should fold the ""About"" and ""Check for Updates"" dialogs into the main window, possibly as siblings to the Preferences items.<p>3. I wish the currently playing song was visually highlighted in the main library view.<p>4. I can't seem to enqueue an entire playlist from the top level Playlists screen.<p>5. There's no intuitive way to go ""back"" after drilling into a Playlist's detailed view.<p>6. There's no easy way to look at the contents of several playlists one after another.<p>I feel like 5 and 6 could be solved by redesigning the top level playlists view to include both the lists of playlists and their contents, a la the Library view.

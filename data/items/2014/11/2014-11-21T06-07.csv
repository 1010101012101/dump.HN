8640145,comment,8638352,8638596,0,0,Derbasti,,,"> Has anyone succeeded in deliberately changing editors, even when not feeling like it&#x27;s necessary? I&#x27;m especially curious how I could start using emacs, and actually get up to speed with it instead of using it as Notepad/TextEdit (as I would do if I started today)?<p>I used to use Textmate at the University. Then XCode at my first job. Then I learned Vim, since every hacker in the internet seemed to love it, the usual story... (big plus: many IDEs have very good Vim key bindings)<p>Then I simply wanted to know what Emacs would be like. I took a bit of a productivity hit for about a week or two, but not more. Over the next year or so I read the Emacs manual and dove deeply down the rabbit hole. It has been four years now. Somewhere along the way I picked up enough elisp to be dangerous.<p>TL;DR: Want to learn a new editor? Just do it. There&#x27;s no magic to it. Do the tutorial, RTFM, take the short-term productivity hit.",1416553109

What I did is just look up the reading lists of the appropriate subjects at the university I was at and started reading down the list.

Charge for it (e.g. $100 a year), and have an &quot;Indie eShop&quot; along with the &quot;eShop&quot;. The open app store models works great for companies that control both hardware and software, and all video game companies fit perfectly in that niche.<p>It seems that it will be that way soon because MS, Sony, and Nintendo have been increasingly more open to indies in the past decade- for the very good reason that it makes business sense. It&#x27;d be very surprising if the trend reversed- and it&#x27;s  surprising that it&#x27;s taking so long for it to reach its logical conclusion.<p>Particularly for Nintendo: if they make the 3DS an openly programmable computer with an app store, there could be some very unexpected apps (not video game related) that would open up new revenue streams.

8640126,comment,8638977,8638977,0,0,graycat,,,"Good lecture:  Important content, well organized,
clear.<p>But, but, but:  It looks like there is a kind of a
<i>bus</i> or <i>bandwagon</i>, and after this lecture I&#x27;m
thinking of either not getting on or just jumping
off before going too far.<p>Sure, YMMV.<p>More generally, I&#x27;m concluding that for information
technology start-ups, Silicon Valley equity funding
is on a long walk on a short pier, about to go the
way of the Dodo bird.<p>E.g., the lecture told me that the <i>Silicon Valley
way</i> is awash in onerous, nearly intolerable, often
seriously dysfunctional, financial, legal,
organizational, etc. overhead that is unnecessary
and should be dumped into SF Bay and forgotten
about.<p>Instead, with some irony, I remember the advice of
Ron Conway in Lecture 9<p><a href=""http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec09/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec09/</a><p>in praise of bootstrapping.<p>My view:  Be a solo, technical founder.  Plan the
start-up; get a computer; write the software; own
100% of the business; organize as a Sub-chapter S or
LLC; get users/customers and revenue; do not accept
equity funding; grow the business; smile all the way
to the bank; and totally just f&#x27;get about VC,
liquidation preferences, pro-rata rights, vesting,
reporting to a board of directors, a Delaware
corporation, etc.<p><i>Vesting</i>:  That&#x27;s where a solo founder who owns
100% of a business -- and it&#x27;s got to be a pretty
good business before it qualifies for VC equity
funding, e.g., see (5) below -- has the business
take an equity check and suddenly owns 0% of the
business, to start to get back some ownership gets a
four year <i>vesting</i> schedule with a one year
<i>cliff</i>, takes on a lot of expensive, onerous
overhead, and reports to a BoD with people with a
fiduciary responsibility to (themselves and) their
limited partners, that can fire the founder for any
reason or no reason (thus costing the founder his
unvested stock -- do that in the first year and the
founder gave his business away to the investors for
a small salary for a few months and $0.00) who are
non-technical and the founder would not want to hire
in the business, who do not write code, who commonly
claim they have &quot;deep domain knowledge&quot; (an
outrageous belly laugh) and, really, do not
understand the business.  Total bummer.<p>To me, if a well qualified technical founder
believes that he needs co-founders and/or equity
funding, then, instead, he should think of a better
business idea that doesn&#x27;t need those and that he
can do as a solo founder.<p>Some really good news:  The US is just awash, border
to border, crossroads, villages, ..., to the biggest
cities with successful businesses 100% owned by solo
founders.  Indeed, from all I&#x27;ve seen, it is mostly
just such founders who own houses, vacation
houses, super-cars, boats, and jewelry worth $1+
million each and pay full tuition for K-12 private
schools and Ivy League colleges.  E.g., own 10 fast
food restaurants, several new car dealerships, a
good independent insurance agency, be a successful
dentist, have a good construction firm of larger
buildings, own and rent real estate, etc.<p>Further, actually can do fairly well in coin
laundries, pizza shops, Chinese carry outs,
landscaping, ..., even just grass mowing and snow
plowing.<p>And of course these solo founder Main Street, USA
businesses nearly never have VC or even equity
funding.<p>Even better news:  What can be done in principle,
and sometimes in practice, with a computer that
costs $2000- and an Internet connection with upload
speed of 25 Mbps is just staggering, nearly beyond
belief.  E.g., there was the Canadian romantic
matchmaking start-up Plenty of Fish, long just one
guy, two old Dell servers, ads just from Google, and
$10 million in annual revenue.<p>Five points:<p>(1) For more, a big lesson of the Altman course, YC,
and VC is that there is a big risk of disaster from
co-founder disputes but also a big theme of don&#x27;t be
a solo founder.  Maybe there are some good reasons
investors don&#x27;t like solo founders, but I can see
big reasons well qualified technical founders
should want to be solo founders.<p>(2) For more, this latest lecture and much more,
e.g., John Doerr from KPCB, keep saying that ideas
are easy, plentiful, and worthless and that
execution is challenging, risky, and everything.<p>My version would be, good ideas are challenging,
rare, valuable, and nearly everything and, given a
good idea, execution is routine and reliable.<p>It appears that Silicon Valley (SV) believes that an
<i>idea</i> is just some one sentence product description
a founder might explain to his neighbor and regards
everything else as <i>execution</i>.  So, it appears that
SV fails to understand what else should be in a good
<i>idea</i>.  No wonder on average VC has poor ROI:<p><a href=""http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/02/venture-capital-returns.html#disqus_thread"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/02/venture-capital-returns.html...</a><p>But a good idea might be based on some original
research, <i>secret sauce</i>, challenging for others to
duplicate, and be protected as a trade secret or
with a patent.  Some people believe that some trade
secrets and patents are valuable <i>assets</i>, maybe
just crucial to the business, and not easy,
plentiful, or worthless.<p>So a founder wants to report to a BoD that believes
that ideas are worthless?  What about some original
and solid ideas for much more effective ad
targeting?  Easy?  Worthless?  Gads.<p>(3) For more, VCs keep saying that a start-up that
claims that they have no competition is just silly,
that there is always competition or at least near
substitutes.  Let&#x27;s see:  What about the original
Xerox 914 copier, a license to print money?<p>(4) For more, there is the common claim that
whatever a start-up is doing, it is not the first.
Hmm .... Suppose we take the set of all efforts that
did the same thing and there consider the effort
that was started with the earliest date.  Then that
effort contradicts the claim.<p>(5) For more, some of the VC arithmetic doesn&#x27;t work
out:<p>E.g., once Menlo Ventures wrote me that they would
not consider an investment in my work before I had
100,000 unique visitors a month.  Okay, assume (a)
each month, on average, each unique visitor comes 5
times and each time sees 8 Web pages, (b) each Web
page has on average 4 ads, and (c) get paid $1 per
1000 ads displayed.  Then the monthly revenue would
be<p><pre><code>     100,000 * 5 * 8 * 4 * 1 / ( 1000 ) = 16,000
</code></pre>
dollars.  If the site soon has 100,000 unique
visitors a month, then maybe soon it will have 1
million and, right, $160,000 a month.<p>But the CapEx to serve 1 million uniques a month?
Let&#x27;s see:<p>That would be an average of<p><pre><code>     1 * 10**6 * 5 * 8 / ( 3600 * 24 * 30 ) = 15.4
</code></pre>
Web pages a second.  Even if need, say, CapEx, of 30
servers at $2000 each, that&#x27;s just<p><pre><code>     30 * 2000 = 60,000
</code></pre>
dollars to get revenue of $160,000 a month.  So, buy
the servers in the first month and just use them in
future months.<p>I can understand that a start-up with 100,000 unique
visitors a month and five co-founders, each with a
pregnant wife, might very much want some equity
funding.  So, be a solo founder.<p>In simple terms, by the time a solo founder has a
business of interest to VCs, he has high motivation
just to continue to own 100% of the business and
f&#x27;get about equity funding.<p>With points (1)-(5), I see a pattern:  Denigrate
founders.<p>Net, I&#x27;m missing why good technical founders should
want to be on that bus.<p>Yes, YMMV.",1416552304

8640098,comment,8637410,8639676,0,0,ealloc,,,"I think the parent is talking about a response to this point of view. Historically, people first wondered whether QM could be explained by hidden variables. Then they proved it could not, which seemed to imply &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;. But now, Susskind is arguing that actually the logic of the &#x27;hidden variable&#x27; gives the right intuition, even though there isn&#x27;t actually a hidden variable.<p>Here&#x27;s how I have come to think of it: When you create the two opposite-spin particles and send them to opposite ends of the galaxy, they exist in a superposition of states which follows QM probabilities. The spins are anti-aligned in all of these possible states , but pointing in a different direction in each state. When one person observes his/her particle, you can imagine it&#x27;s like they are &#x27;masking out&#x27; many of the possible states, leaving just one of the possible &quot;universes&quot;. But no matter which &quot;universe&quot; gets masked out, in the &quot;surviving universe&quot; the spins are going to be anti-aligned.<p>This is a lot like the &#x27;hidden variable&#x27; picture where the spins were pre-decided and put into boxes, and when person A opened her box and saw &quot;up&quot; she knew that the other person must have the &quot;down&quot; spin. The difference is that QM probabilities are not consistent with the probabilities you would get from such a boxing procedure (in particular when the observers measure the spin at different angles). But conceptually, opening the box and realizing that you have the &quot;up&quot; spin and therefore the other person has down is a lot like doing a spin measurement and masking out many of the superpositions, and concluding that the other person must have the opposite spin from what you measured.",1416551473

For the reason that if there&#x27;s any chance you&#x27;re going to take angel investment or give stock to employees, you almost need a C Corp. In fact, the lack of a standard C Corp just creates complications with investors and employees that puts you at risk. Keep it simple.<p><i></i>*<p>C Corporations are almost necessary if you are planning on taking investment. They are not as tax-efficient as LLCs because they&#x27;re taxed twice (once at the corporate level, and another time at the personal income level / capital gains level depending on whether $ is paid out via salary or dividend.) However, they come with the benefit of having different classes of stock (usually required for investors / employee stock options).<p>LLCs are pass-through entities. They reduce taxes for shareholders by basically eliminating payroll / capital gains taxes.<p>If you have an LLC and want to take investment, it is relatively straightforward to convert to a C Corp if its early enough in the company&#x27;s lifespan.<p>On the other hand, converting from a C Corp to an LLC is a pain (you have to create a separate LLC and have it buy the assets of the C Corp, which creates a taxable event).<p>An s-election is a good option to reduce tax-liability of a corporation. It grants pass-through status. However, to be eligible, you have to file in the first 75 days of the year, you can only have common stock, and all shareholders have to be US Citizens (no LLCs, etc).",1416551108

And run comparison tests about those ravines against the ravines for say zebras.<p>This is something actively being done by nn researches. And it lets us do things like take the low level audio processing part of a neural net trained on english voice data, and use it to train smarter neural nets on Portugese voice data than you couldn&#x27;ve without the English voice recordings.",1416549710

Fun to see it pop up here.",1416549681

More than less subscribers are around the 5.5kf+ (kilotfoot) range, which usually means sub 15 megabit speeds - and a limited upload (inherent to all ADSL types).",1416549629

(By definition, an independent contractor is <i>not</i> an agent.)<p>If Uber is only entitled to X% of the fare, then under GAAP it can only recognize that X% as revenue.  This is the exact same funky accounting that Groupon used.  (Note that customers of Groupon would also take their problems to Groupon, not the merchant.)",1416549615

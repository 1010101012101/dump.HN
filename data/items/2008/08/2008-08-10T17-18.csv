272453,comment,272322,272431,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"Shale oil and tar sands are a joke.  Maximum production will only ever be a drop relative to super-giant field output.  You get poor energy returns due to enormous inputs of natural gas and fresh water and the intensive refining requirements.  The ecological horror of these extraction methods alone means they will never scale.  The impending scarcity of natural gas will nip shale/tar in the bud right quick, anyway.<p>In about three different ways in your post you said ""Don't worry, somebody will figure out a way to deal with these big problems sooner or later.""

Not that the oil in the North Sea will last, of course.<p>Norway has larger oil-fields in the North Sea and export quite a lot.<p>The 99% from the Middle East in 1973 is probably a journalistic exaggeration - 99% from outside the country would probably be correct (the oil in the North Sea was found in the 70s).<p>Oh, and we burn a lot of coal in Denmark.

We're talking about a pretty low man-hour investment in futzing with MySQL before you'd have been better off calling an IBM rep.

272443,comment,272266,272266,0,0,aofstad,,,"I would guess that their research only shows that light can be bent around a simple object like a disk or sphere, and not an arbitrarily shaped object like a tank or ship.  I don't think they'll have the technology in the near future to create a metamaterial that bends light around any sort of vehicle or non-trivial object.  In order to bend light around an object, the metamaterial needs to be anisotropic, meaning the index of refraction changes throughout the material in three dimensional space.  While this can be done in the lab with a simple object, it would be incredibly difficult and expensive to produce an anisotropic metamaterial that would hide something large and arbitrarily shaped, and the methods to produce or mass produce such metamaterials are still a long way off.  This is especially true with visible light, where the metamaterial must be built on the nanoscale.<p>In any case, this is still an incredible breakthrough.  It hasn't taken them too long to move this technology from the microwave spectrum to the visible light spectrum, so progress may be fairly quick.  Especially considering the huge amount of money the military is probably sinking into this for obvious reasons.<p>Here is some of the original metamaterial invisibility work on the microwave spectrum:

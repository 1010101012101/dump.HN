Since I'm, you know, a user on the site?<p>I would have argued this position no matter what company had done it, because I think it's the right of the company. Mind you, if certain other companies has done this my stance would have been more along the lines of ""They're allowed to do it, but they're assholes."" Amazon, on the other hand, has never once done something to violate my trust. So when <i>they</i> do it, my reaction is ""They're allowed to do it, and I can understand what made them do it.""",1247925331

The job offered a lot of downtime, so he taught himself enough to program.<p>He became one of their developers and the lead developer at multiple other firms, including two he co-founded with me.<p>I should add that while he hasn't finished his ""top tier"" undergrad degree, he's very close.<p>He got hired <i>at Google</i> relatively recently (~2 years back) and is rising through the ranks.",1247924874

Many great scientists and inventors have been self-taught (eg Michael Faraday).<p>Also, I'm the opposite of his guy.  I went to Oxford. Studied mathematics and computer science and stayed and got a doctorate. I would suck at leading IE development.<p>As a hiring manager I look at what people can do, and then I look at their education. I do this becausesome of the best engineers I've worked with majored in non-CS/EE.<p>BTW I am hiring Java developers in London.",1247924681
711734,comment,709460,709977,0,0,giardini,,,"like vitamin A, Vitamin E is fat-soluble. But an overdose of vitamin A can kill you.<p>In contrast there is no LD50 level defined for vitamin E IIRC. There are anecdotal descriptions of unpleasant side-effects (e.g., diarrhea) but these are vague and may be the result of consuming a large amount of oil at one time (vitamin E is usually taken in oil solution), without ramping up the daily dosage slowly. To the best of my knowledge no one has ever died or suffered permanent ill effects from taking vitamin E.<p>Vitamin D is also fat-soluble but much less toxic than vitamin A. You may have had your doctor recently test your blood for vitamin D levels. If you test low (and most do) you may be given a prescription of vitamin D of 50,000 units twice a week for 10 weeks or so. As recently as two years ago many doctors would have become alarmed should you tell them you took a vitamin D dose higher than 400 units/day. Obviously something has changed: vitamin D has proven to be much less toxic and far more efficacious than rumour and folklore medicine has said it was:<p><a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-07-13-vitamin-d-tests_N.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-07-13-vitamin-d-tes...</a><p>The revised recommendations for vitamin D were slow in coming. I had for years seen rickets in otherwise well-nourished children resulting from parents slathering sunscreen on their offspring before every outing. Nieces and nephews were affected by the overzealous recommendations of the American Academy of Dermatology. After all this time vitamin D proves to be a keystone ingredient to preventing cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, indeed most diseases.<p>My point is that, just because a vitamin is ""fat-soluble"" doesn't mean that megadoses will hurt you. Most of the lore associated with the term is from vitamin A's history.<p>If you get a serious sunburn or burn take a big dose of vitamin E. It will help and, unlike CBLC102, it is cheap and readily available _today_.<p>If you fear nuclear terrorism then my recommendation is to buy a bottle of vitamin E and put it on your kitchen shelf. Next time a nuclear bomb goes off in your neighborhood take a mouthful and run like hell.",1247924663

I lost about 60 pounds, and then over the next 4 or 5 years, proceeded to put 40 of them back on.<p>This year I've re-lost those 40 pounds, and am working on losing another 40, not by counting calories or otherwise trying to find low cal versions of everything (hard to do anyway now that I'm in Norway), but by being more conscious about what I eat (trying to eat more fruits, veggies, and whole grains, while eating fewer processed foods and sugars) and exercising regularly, which is much easier to do.  Well, the exercise part still sucks, but I remind myself that once I get to the weight I want to be at, I only have to go enough to maintain that weight.",1247924400

711728,comment,711709,711709,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"What I find striking is that someone working at a gas station, and with apparently no formal CS education, could get hired and eventually become a lead developer, at Microsoft.  Google would <i>never</i> hire someone like Zeke (they might have in the past, but not current Google); without a degree from a ""top-tier school"", you don't even get past the first steps of the interview process.<p>Say what you will about IE (Zeke is apparently lead on the project), Microsoft actually does have a lot of good software developers working there.  I can't imagine someone would rise to a lead role on a major product like IE without being pretty damned good.  And, there probably is something to hiring really passionate people over someone with a lot of qualification who could take it or leave it...companies like Google that weed out first based on school and grades, might just be missing out on a huge class of talent.<p>I can think of a few well-known examples of this (jwz, most of the 8-bit game developers, John Carmack, etc.).  Not to say the guy responsible for IE is necessarily in that class...but, nonetheless, there's an awful lot of great developers who never went to a good school for CS.",1247923982

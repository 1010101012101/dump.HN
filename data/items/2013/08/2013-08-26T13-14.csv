They choice you have then is to vote with your clicks and go elsewhere or attempt to use the site with an ad-blocker.<p>If any site admin wishes me to go elsewhere they can block users with ad blockers installed. If the site has value then they an ask POLITELY to whitelist their site; which for many sites I do add then to a site wide whitelist.<p>Assuming your site visitors of being thieves is not only stupid but illogical. If I walk past a billboard with my eyes close should I have them surgically removed because their are an adblocker? If I use a PVR to skip ads on TV am I stealing content? No; I am exercising a choice not to look at your pointless adverts.<p>The adverts add nothing to my experience of your site; I don&#x27;t click on them so you won&#x27;t be making any money from me for displaying them anyway.<p>Either find some other way to monetize your site (subs, sell merchandise, ask for donations etc) or find something else to do.",1377525589

From there you can calculate all sorts of ratios to apply to people, and I&#x27;d bet you could make a pretty good guess at gait for motion analysis.<p>A database like this would also be proof against facial surgery; changing bone lengths is harder.

6277039,comment,6275178,6275178,5,0,mcdougle,,,"As most people seem to right now, until the past few months I thought of Microsoft as sort of an aging giant. They had gotten lax during their monopoly, and instead of keeping up with the times they&#x27;re struggling to keep up with more &quot;hip&quot; companies like Google and Apple. And in the public space, this is true -- the average consumer (or the small business/startup rather than the large corporation) these days is more likely to buy an Apple product or a Google product if they can. The average consumer has a better mental image of Apple or Google than Microsoft.<p>And then I started my job at a large hospital system assisting the guys who do financial analytics, and saw the other side of the industry. Microsoft is still the giant in corporate-level big data analytics and providing solutions for large server farms. Their B.I. stack (SQL Server, reporting software, Sharepoint, and other data analytics software I won&#x27;t go into right now) is worlds ahead of its competition (and from what I understand can be used interchangably with the other software -- for example you can hook Tableau into SQL Server and use it as a front-end for an SSAS cube). I would have never thought about any of this if I hadn&#x27;t been at this job, but Microsoft is still a giant in providing software and systems for hospitals, insurance companies, big banks and others in the financial sector -- big companies that need to procsess big data. In addition, as the article states, Microsoft is a leading competitor in providing cloud hosting solutions -- I went to a Microsoft thing to learn about and test Windows Azure, and it&#x27;s incredibly powerful and so easy to use.<p>The article kind of hints at this stuff -- that, under Ballmer, Microsoft has actually been successful despite their stock falling and how the general public perceives them. They&#x27;re not failing, it&#x27;s just that the people who buy the stock are typically the average consumer who see Microsoft in the light I mentioned above. The stock market isn&#x27;t always the best indication of a company&#x27;s success, just an indication of what the people who buy stock think.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean I like Microsoft. I just wanted to point out something I don&#x27;t think many people pay attention to -- they&#x27;re still wildly successful, just in a different market segment, and people might not have noticed that if they weren&#x27;t actually in that market segment. I still prefer not to use their products when I can help it, and I think they could do things much better, and maybe trying to actually compete with Apple and Google and earn the general public&#x27;s respect back would be a good thing. Maybe their &quot;next era&quot; will do this. But then again, I&#x27;m the individual consumer, too.",1377525502

6276947,comment,6274128,6275126,2,0,bzbarsky,,,"A few things, specifically about the US health care system:<p>1)  Unlike medical procedures, for dental procedures it&#x27;s pretty easy to get price quotes from multiple dentists: they will tell you their sticker price if asked.  They will also give you the procedure code so you can ask your dental insurance (if any) to what extent that&#x27;s covered so you&#x27;ll know what the actual price to you is.  People will in fact comparison-shop for major dental procedures, based on cost, dentist reputation, etc.<p>2)  The situation with emergency or time-sensitive procedures (pneumonia, tetanus shot, cut inside mouth) and scheduled non-emergency ones (hip replacement, say, or laser eye surgery) is a priori quite different.  It is in fact possible to sanely price-shop for hip replacements if people are willing to tell you prices and there is reputational data available.  Unfortunately the medical establishment works hard to prevent both.  Laser eye surgery is a particularly interesting case, because there _is_ freely available price information there; you may want to look at what&#x27;s happened to its price over time.  Learning as much about such a procedure as people tend to know about buying cars is not actually all that hard: people don&#x27;t know that much about cars and there really isn&#x27;t that much to know about some of the fairly standardized scheduled procedures.<p>3)  People do in fact do the &quot;90% functionality at much lower cost is just fine&quot; thing all the time, with glasses (e.g. buying reading glasses at CVS instead of getting a prescription pair), dental procedures, and some scheduled medical procedures.  You&#x27;re right that &quot;50% less effective treatment at 50% of the cost&quot; doesn&#x27;t happen much, though.  Instead you get 100% less effective lack of treatment at 0% of the cost....<p>4)  Since you brought up baby deliveries....  Sorry, pet peeve.  If a hospital is charging you $20000 for a low-risk birth with no complications (which they definitely do!), that&#x27;s an excellent indicator of how broken the system is.  If you shop around for how much that sort of thing costs with people who specialize in low-risk births (birth centers, midwives), you will discover that the typical price for birth plus prenatal visits with no complications in the US is in the $3-5k range.  Of course such a setup will not do the various wholly unnecessary things that will be done in a typical hospital birth setting, nor will it be subject to typical hospital billing practices.<p>5)  A good bit of care in the US is end-of-life care, where it is in fact quite possible to make price/time tradeoffs to some extent, as well as comfort/time ones (e.g. hospice vs aggressive cancer treatment that might prolong life for a few months) and people who are in a position to make that choice can in fact make it in an informed way.<p>In practice, what we call &quot;medicine&quot; is a bunch of separate services that have totally different economics, often being bundled together with completely opaque pricing put on top.  For some of them, there is lack of informed customers and lack of choice in outcomes, as you say.  For others one or both are present.  And even today some parts of &quot;medicine&quot; (e.g. scheduled dental cleanings) work quite different from other parts (e.g. pediatric well-child checkups; try to get a price quote from a doctor for one of these!) for no particularly good reasons that I can see.<p>The &quot;right&quot; solution to this problem is unclear to me, unfortunately, because as you point out there is a fair amount of emergency medicine where a free market cannot possibly operate.  A good example of such a thing is the total lack of any possibility of a free market in emergency ambulance transport, from the patient&#x27;s point of view.  We should stop our attempts at a fake free market in those areas, but we should also try to create actual free markets in medicine where possible.  And for quite a few things I believe it is in fact possible.",1377524526

Sounds obvious, but most guys starting out actually believe that there&#x27;s a chance of it playing out like this. Starry-eyed optimism is probably a precondition for going anywhere near this business in the first place, but it must be tempered and kept in check at all times.<p>If you are building a game of substance (rather than a simple puzzler/platformer mobile app - which is a lottery ticket more than a business model), the game will likely take way longer to develop. As it should. Good games take time. This means that you should either be very well-funded, or have extremely low costs of living, or be working on the side of another income (in which case it will take even longer). This is not the way to instant riches, but since when did that ever work? Double down, dig your heels in, this will take <i>years</i>. But the end result is an awesome game.<p>Further to the point, you should probably not think in terms of <i>the release</i> that ends the project and where all your efforts either pay off or fall flat. Instead, the game should be put in front of users continually, gathering feedback, going back to the lab to improve it and repeating the cycle until momentum starts to pick up. That&#x27;s when you know that you are near the final shape of the game. Don&#x27;t even think about talking to the press before this. Luckily, if there is one community that is ready to try new things at any and all times it is gamers, so you shouldn&#x27;t have much trouble getting this feedback. (Conversely, if even the ravenous internet hordes are indifferent to your project, you might need to tweak the formula).<p>While a long and hard road, a game developed this way actually stands a chance of success in the market, unlike the &#x27;overnight success&#x27; stories that play well in the press.",1377524470

No. I don&#x27;t think you do. I don&#x27;t think you have a clue.

Thats just one quick simple example.

Some of that will be useful to you (interesting stuff) and some of that will be useful to me (ad impressions).<p>Apparently, many people are not comfortable with that kind of exchange. However, people being people, they still want to see the interesting stuff. So what do they do, they install this (free!) ad blocker that gets rid of all the things that are not immediately useful to them. Unethical? Possibly. But not illegal, and not even widely frowned upon.<p>So at this point, as a businessperson, I must ask myself whether my business model is still viable. If not, I must change it. That&#x27;s what it means to be an entrepreneur: find ways to turn labour into money. Under Western democracies, I have that right, subject to laws and regulations. What I do not have is the right to having my particular business model be forever profitable.<p>This is a concept that the music, movie and game industries refused to wrap their head around. Their model was (and largely still is) &quot;I give you these plastic things with bits on them and you give me money&quot;. This was acceptable to consumers as long as the plastic was required in order to be able to distribute bits. When this ceased to be the case, the business model started to fail. Rather than move to a different model (which, I realise, I make sound much easier than it is), they held onto the failing one, introducing complicated and fail-prone systems to prevent people from separating the bits from the plastic, in the process alienating their customers by making it harder and hard to actually use their products.<p>So, no, I don&#x27;t feel bad when your business fails because of ad blocking. Being a selfish jerk, I&#x27;m upset you no longer send me interesting stuff. Being a compassionate human being, I&#x27;m sad a bunch of people lose their source of income. But this is the free market. If your business fails, you did something wrong. Someone else will come along and do it right.",1377524248

I&#x27;ve never seen it personally, but I&#x27;ve heard its spectacular and seen some interesting pictures of the luxurious common areas.<p>If you permit skywalks to make one large building, technically most of downtown Minneapolis and (I think?)

If you define &quot;a building&quot; as you can walk from one place to another indoors.<p>I don&#x27;t think interaction scales as well as some think, I lived in a 13 floor roughly 600 person dorm at university and as I think back I never set foot on perhaps a third of the floors, and spent the vast majority of my time on just two floors.

It is Scientifically Correct to say that there is very little difference, genetically, between Europeans, Asians, Africans, Latin Americans, etc.  It also happens to be Politically Correct.  However, it is also Scientifically Correct to say that there are huge disparities in victim reported violent crime rates between Europeans, Asians, Africans, and Latin Americans.  However, this is not Politically Correct.  This is an example of where a problem is identified, but unable to be discussed in the public sphere.  If a problem can&#x27;t be discussed, it can&#x27;t be solved.<p>An African-American male is over 7 times more likely to murder a person than a Hispanic or European-American male.  He is also over 6 times more likely to be the victim of a murder.  This is elementary statistics based on data collected by the FBI. If this problem (which in my opinion is cultural rather than this phony construct called &quot;racial&quot;) can&#x27;t be discussed in an honest fashion due to political organizations which will threaten politicians with boycotts/villification/etc due to their refusal to acknowledge inconvenient truths, then the problem will simply continue.  Not talking about it makes the problem become uglier, because non-Black Americans in general have internalized the fact that poor Black neighborhoods are vastly more violent and dangerous.  Any realtor can tell you this.  They deal with people&#x27;s ACTUAL prejudices every day, rather than the Politically Correct, aspirational notions of the desire to live in a diverse neighborhood.<p>I say this as a white guy who grew up in various poor parts of the south, and spent large parts of my childhood with mostly black friends in mostly black neighborhoods.  Political Correctness prevents us from collectively helping the predominantly black victims of a large sub-culture of black America that celebrates crime, dehumanizes women and gays, views educational/career achievement as betrayal of black identity, and tolerate men who willingly abandon their families.<p>America will not succeed as a nation unless black Americans succeed, and political correctness throws them to the wolves by pretending a problem they are victimized by doesn&#x27;t exist.",1377524052

London, for example, is a metropolitan, racially diverse city that is nonetheless 60% white.<p>I&#x27;m not denying that there are European cities that are racially diverse. But every single U.S. city over a million people, and most of the cities between 500,000 and 1 million, are majority-minority, usually by a large margin (say 2:1). I think that&#x27;s a phenomenon that&#x27;s alien to major European cities.<p>As an aside, I think Europeans unfairly jump to calling Americans racist, when they don&#x27;t have to deal with the political dynamics of majority-minority cities. It&#x27;s one thing for a city to be diverse. It&#x27;s another thing when the dominant ethnic group of a country ends up being a minority in the city, in the process losing political control, etc. Add to that the layer of economic conflict that arises from tax revenues flowing from the richer majority to pay for municipal services for the poorer majority. That creates a wholly different political dynamic, one that is alien to Europeans.<p>Look at Paris. There is tremendous tension there between whites and Arabs. But the Muslim population of Paris is only 10-15% (estimated). What would the political dynamic in France be like if Paris were 60-70% Muslim and hadn&#x27;t elected a non-Muslim mayor in 40 years, yet still relied on whites for most of the tax revenue?

However, if you divide your neighborhood in 9 blocks such that you are in the center, you have 8 neighbors.<p>Schelling&#x27;s model now shows that even in cities where most people say:&quot;I&#x27;d like to live next to only 35-40% of people who are similar to me (whatever that means exactly, could be ethnical background, skin color, income, ...) and I&#x27;d accept 60% of neighbors who are different from me&quot;, you would still get a segregation of 80-90% in the city.<p>So, the reason for strong segregation is not necessarily that people are racists. People can be very tolerant, but if you try to fulfill the minimum requirement (40% like me), you end up with strong segregation patterns just because there&#x27;s no other way to fulfill the minimum requirement for most people.<p>Note: Numbers aren&#x27;t exact, but pretty close.<p>Edit: Link to lecture: <a href=""https://class.coursera.org/modelthinking-003/lecture/16"" rel=""nofollow"">https://class.coursera.org/modelthinking-003/lecture/16</a>",1377523303

Physical attributes influence us as well, whether it&#x27;s bikers and leather jackets or punks and black spiked clothes. In evolutionary biology this is referred to as &quot;kinship&quot;.<p>Not to say that racism isn&#x27;t worth fighting against, but the more free our societies become the more people on average will follow their natural instincts. A non-racial example of this is Norway, which is likely the most gender equal country in the world, but has also extremely skewed gender distributions in professions such as engineering and nursing; with almost only men in engineering, and women in nursing, despite massive attempts to balance the situation. This could be easily misinterpreted and claimed as evidence that Norway does not respect gender equality, but in fact it&#x27;s more likely evidence of the opposite! People in Norway are more free to pursue what makes <i>them</i> happy.<p>When we use terms like &quot;segregation&quot; for cases where it might actually be just &quot;separation&quot;, we risk causing unnecessary hatred and overblown illusions of racism - misleading us from what actually matters: freedom and equality.",1377522910

So you see much less segregation in predominantly white cities like Portland than in cities like Chicago that have an even mix of races, which have less segregation than predominantly black cities like Detroit or New Orleans.<p>As far as I can tell, most European cities are predominantly white, so I wouldn&#x27;t expect as much segregation in those cities as you see in say Chicago or Detroit or Philadelphia. London is one of the more ethnically diverse (large) Western European cities, and is roughly 60% white. LA is the whitest large American city at 50%. New York is 45%, Chicago is 30%, etc. New Orleans is around 25% white, and Detroit is 8% white. At the other end of the scale, Portland is 75% white. If you look at the map, the ordering by level of segregation follows that pattern: Portland is the least segregated, Detroit is the most segregated, and LA, New York, Chicago, and New Orleans are between, in that order.<p>[1] You can argue about whether this is racism or classism. As a practical matter, in American cities the two are tightly linked. Middle class people of both races tend to move to the suburbs, and of the people that are left, whites skew wealthier and blacks and hispanics skew poorer, even more so than in the general population.

This can be done by affirming that you are on the same page with him, that you and him share the same goal.
You can also do this by denying what the other person might be afraid of, such as &quot;I don&#x27;t think your opinion is stupid&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t want to abolish guns for hunting purposes&quot;.
These methods come from &quot;Crucial Conversations&quot;, it goes in depth on the underlying emotional motivations of conversations.

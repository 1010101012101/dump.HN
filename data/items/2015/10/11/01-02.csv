Many companies dont have regular processes, and rely on employees forsaking weekends in order to deliver things on time.<p>I know it&#x27;s usually not popular here to talk about the necessity of Project Managers, but the Video Games Industry is a pretty good example of an situation where more (i.e. better) management could help make things better compared to the current mess.",1444528102

In order to do so, I need to discover the pertinent information about the background and knowledge of my conversation partners.<p>> If you actually meant services, then what&#x27;s your point?<p>I <i>did</i>. That would be why I asked about <i>services</i> rather than RC systems. :) I know that <i>many</i> people don&#x27;t work this way, but if you can try to keep in mind [0] that I try <i>hard</i> to say what I mean, and leave nothing but white noise in between the lines of my statements.<p>Anyway, my point is this. You said:<p>> I&#x27;d take systemd over sysv init, atd, crond, three or four watcher daemons, syslog, various other semi-maintained tools that replicate each other&#x27;s functionality...<p>which I took to be a little strange. It <i>seems</i> like this is your understanding of the typical set of services a Linux system runs, but it doesn&#x27;t jive with how either I or my handful of professional sysadmin friends run our systems. We generally don&#x27;t run atd, leave any FS watching up to the software package that actually needs it, avoid using tools that duplicate each other&#x27;s functionality like the plague, and tend to not use unmaintained software... unless it&#x27;s clear that that software is &quot;done&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve known several friends and acquaintances who have gone off to work for Red Hat. They&#x27;ve -to a man- come back with <i>some</i> really strange, <i>very</i> hard-line positions about how Linux systems are &quot;supposed&quot; to work. <i>One</i> of them <i>vehemently</i> insisted that -because of the complexity of dependency management and testing- a highly-flexible, rolling-release distro like Gentoo Linux was <i>impossible</i>. [1] Because of my personal experience with how Red Hat seems to have enweirdened some of my friends and acquaintances, and because I knew next to nothing about your background, I wanted to ensure that you <i>had</i> indeed stepped out of the Red Hat bubble and <i>seriously</i> looked at what other companies and distros consider a typical set of services and the features provided by and operation of their sysvrc replacements.<p>[0] I won&#x27;t fault you if you can&#x27;t. I have <i>quite</i> a difficult time remembering what I had for breakfast, let alone the rhetorical styles of the couple-dozen one-off Internet conversation partners that I&#x27;ve had over the past several months. :)<p>[1] Note that his position was <i>not</i> &quot;Only a fool would attempt to provide guaranteed enterprise support for any and all arbitrary Gentoo Linux configurations because of $COMPLEXITY.&quot;! I can&#x27;t argue with that position. I asked him if perhaps he misspoke and that maybe <i>this</i> or something similar was closer to his actual position.

I&#x27;ve seen thus in call centres - the best ones I&#x27;ve seen have had no KPIs, the ones with strict call time KPIs have led to dreadful customer service as the entire goal of the operator is to get you off the phone, not resolve your problem. In that situation, they tell the customer literally anything in order to keep them happy but make them hang up.<p>Giving this level of metrics to lower level managers is a bad idea, instead I truly believe it should be kept with people who know how to handle data and interpret the results correctly.<p>---<p>Footnotes:<p>1. <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2009/08/people_understand_ri.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2009/08/people_unde...</a>",1444526632

Twitter&#x27;s ToS (and their reps) have said you can embed anything without needing advanced permission; Instagram says the opposite. Media outlets use embedded tweets/Instagrams for editorial purposes everywhere, and this seems like it would be fair use (taking a snippet of a 140 character message as you would with an article makes no sense) but some people still complain. No one has any problem with embedding YouTube videos or Vines. How this all plays out is likely to be decided in the coming decades in courts and the media.<p>Three things that would be incredibly helpful in this area:<p>1) All these services should give users the ability to prevent embedding of their posts either globally or on a post by post basis. Drawing a very bright line like this makes what is and is not OK very clear. Off or on by default would be debatable.<p>2) Supply a UI or API for automatically obtaining licensing permission (requester goes to an Instagram post, clicks/taps &quot;request license to use in/on {web, billboard, TV commercial, etc.}&quot; which sends a message to the original poster, poster can than choose to consent/refuse, response is sent to the requester.<p>3) Make some public statements / legal guarantees (i.e., a promise to stand behind people who get sued even when using service-provided embedding tools) about what they consider acceptable usage.<p>Right now it&#x27;s just very gray, and the safe route is to obtain advanced permission for anything with a photo, which I think goes against the frictionless spirit of the old web (i.e., just put up a link or excerpt a post and be done with it.) The service-provided embedding tools try to maintain that spirit in the more walled-gardeny world, but legal uncertainties still make that iffy. I wrote a bit more on this previously: <a href=""https://medium.com/@sthware/user-generated-content-embedding-and-permission-2ae8b2edcf74"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@sthware/user-generated-content-embedding...</a><p>I&#x27;m not sure what the legal reasoning would be for &quot;hashtags as consent for photo usage&quot;, but something tells me that it probably wouldn&#x27;t hold up in court if it came down to it.<p>Edit: another thing that needs discussion is things that seem innocent to many, but could be legally questionable. Prominent example: retweets. Let&#x27;s say you embed a Twitter widget of your company&#x27;s feed on your web site&#x27;s product page. You retweet something someone has posted about your product. It then appears in the feed, on the web site, next to your products. Protected or not?

I want to think aloud about the question &quot;how do you hire engineers who can work on the backend of a large video game?&quot;.<p>One issue parts of the games industry struggle with is simply coding competency. There&#x27;s a tendency to hire newer grads and folks who will work for lower salaries, because people always want to make games. (And why not? Making games is awesome.) This leads to turnover, poorly thought out (or over-engineered) designs, lack of &quot;common sense&quot; things like load testing before launch (remember the industry standards you learned at college? if your college was anything like mine, you didn&#x27;t), language soup, etc. And in my experience, the best backend systems are built by those with at least a bit of that experience already - rather than gameplay programmers trying to teach themselves what the CAP theorem is. But what senior engineer wants to work with legacy spaghetti code, or unlaunched promises (and the threat of future layoffs), when they could work at Facebook or Google or whoever?<p>At a previous large tech company I worked at, we built a games team internally to work on large scale platform stuff (pretty similar to what PlayFab is doing but aligned with said company&#x27;s products). It was really cool - we got folks who were solid engineers but also ex-games industry, or avid gamers, themselves, advertising team openings via the videogames@ internal mailing list. We tried to combine the culture/fun of the games industry without the baggage and conditions.<p>But platform isn&#x27;t content, and I recently joined a similar kind of team in an actual games company (which operates much more like a tech company than most, since our game is operated as a live service rather than a one-off downloadable release). Being able to work alongside artists, designers, narrative writers, sound engineers, event producers etc creates a really creative environment, and though I&#x27;m working on MySQL performance tuning and internal monitoring data pipelines, I get to hang out and talk about the new champion releases with folks at lunch. A nice balance, but for those who can&#x27;t afford their own platform team, or don&#x27;t have the carrots to lure us in, PlayFab seem like a neat alternative. :)",1444525682

On a very direct level, faster blood circulation from exercise improves brain function.

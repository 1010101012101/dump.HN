But that <i>is</i> assumed, because the puzzle <i>states</i> that the parent says, &quot;At least one of them is a boy.&quot;<p>In other words, &quot;Put this way, the puzzle is highly ambiguous.&quot; No, not it is not. It is absolutely not ambiguous.<p>I made this point in a different comment for a different blog post with the same example, but: both things you link to contain a fallacy, as follows.<p>&quot;Suppose we know that a certain man has two children and we also know that the older one is a boy&quot; IMPLIES &quot;Now suppose we know simply that a man has two children and that one of them is a son. This time we would reason that there is no possibility that the person has two girls.

It&#x27;s not that the two cases are different (in any important way); they are not; one implies the other.<p>It&#x27;s that in the 1/2 case, the person is naive, and in the 1/3 case, the person takes into account the known fact that there is a 1/2 chance per child of getting a certain gender, thus allowing the BB/BG/GB/GG analysis.",1389174420

The explanation lists all the possibilities, and to do so it&#x27;s necessary to distinguish between the children.  The most obvious way to do that is to talk about the older and younger.<p>we know that in families with two children about half the time you have one of each sex.  You only get that if you distinguish between the children in some sense so that there are four overall possibilities: BB, BG, GB, GG.  If you don&#x27;t distinguish between the children then there are only three possibilities: Both boys, both girls, one of each.  Doing real world trials clearly shows that model to be flawed.  We <i>must</i> distinguish between the children when enumerating cases.<p>Forgive me if this is all obvious to you, but I honestly can&#x27;t see your argument, so it&#x27;s necessary to lay down much more detail to try to find where your reasoning varies from mine.<p>So now consider the situation I laid out.  Take all families with two children.  There are four equally likely possibilities.  Eliminate those who cannot truthfully say &quot;At least one child is a boy.&quot;  You are left with three equally likely possibilities.  In only one of those do we have two boys.  Thus one out of three possibilities has both children boys.<p>The probability of both children being boys is 1/3.<p>Can you explain where that reasoning is faulty?<p>Also, computer simulations clearly show that under this model of what&#x27;s going on, the chance of two boys is 1/3.  If you explain the faulty reasoning, you&#x27;ll also need to explain why the computer simulation gives the same answer.",1389172927

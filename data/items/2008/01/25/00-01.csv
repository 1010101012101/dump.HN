103867,comment,103822,103858,0,0,Alex3917,,,"The point of IT is to combine information with technology to answer questions. When designing something like this you need to start by asking yourself what questions your users are trying to answer. The problem with Tufte's sketches is that they answer different questions. The official Apple version of the stock widget is designed to answer the question, ""How much money is my portfolio currently worth?"" Whereas Tufte's version is designed to answer the question, ""Is now a good time to buy a given stock?"" (And I would argue that he answers this question poorly and unaesthetically.)<p>The real problem though is that since his widgets are designed to answer a different set of questions, there isn't really any basis to compare the two sets of designs.",1201220692

It doesn't mean you're automatically the poet laureate of <i>anything</i>, or even a not-terrible poet, but you have written a poem, and you can probably write more poems, therefore you are a poet.<p>Similarly, you are a programmer if you can write computer programs.

Decaf Java is an s-exp representation of a Java program's parse tree.  It is foggy and distant now but I believe we did do a problem set in actual Java and then later in the semester after doing the Scheme in Scheme metacircular evaluator we did the Decaf Java interpreter.

I can't agree with him that this is a good idea.<p>Part of the reason that people BUY the iPhone is that it's simple and stylish, rather than the existing information heavy devices like Pocket PC phones. In particular, look at his example about the Weather- Apple's widget is small and sleek. It shows you the vital information, and it does it in strong fonts and bold styling. It's clear, and it's easy.<p>He squishes all of that information into a tiny corner, so that he can add a large repeating satellite view- Sure it's useful in some cases, and it's certainly a neat demonstration of the iPhone's abilities, but it fails when it comes to the task of quickly giving me the important information.<p>It makes me squint to see the tiny version of the temperature, and shows off, rather than helping.<p>Sometimes developers fall into the problem of working so often because they can, not wondering if they should.<p>Note- He dismisses this argument, saying that information density isn't the problem, it's laying it out clearly. I agree with him in general,in that complex information can often be presented simply, but in most of his cases, increasing the density would diminish it's usefulness.",1201219515

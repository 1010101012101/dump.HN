Perl is more wide-spread and common, making it a better choice if you want to go hacking things that are there, but I find Awk nicer to program.<p>I'd also start looking for massively parallel languages of one form or another.

Also you can run VBScript.  I have seen code that avoid javascript confirm() and tries to check first if it can use VBScripts  msgbox function, just so it can provide 'yes'/'no' buttons.  Aka:<p><pre><code>  function confirmVB (text)
    confirmVB = msgbox ( Text , VBYesNo )
  end function
</code></pre>
and then javascript<p><pre><code>  function confirmYesNo(txtText)
  {
    if (window.vbSupported)
    {
  	return confirmVB(txtText);
    } else  {
  	return confirm(txtText + "" (ok = yes, cancel = no)""   );

No, but ""open"" does.  The implication is that the boxes each contain a piece of paper on which exactly one name is written, and that each box is closed.<p><pre><code>  > the 'answer' I proposed is: prisoner #1 opens 50 boxes,

You are assuming that the boxes can be left open.  That is ruled out when the puzzle says:<p><pre><code>  > and they will not know anything about the previous
  > prisoners' experiences ahead of time.
</code></pre>
If the boxes remain open then, specifically, the second prisoner will know the names that have been seen by the first prisoner.  That's not allowed.<p><pre><code>  > Nitpicking the text further: what is that ahead of

If, for example, their strategy is that everyone opens the first box (which is pretty pointless, but this is just an example) then easch one will learn something about what the others knew.  In this way they know things that the prisoners before them knew.<p>There are puzzles where this is significant.

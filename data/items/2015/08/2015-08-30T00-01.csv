I realize that some (like Lawrence Krauss) have shown that you can get a universe from nothing plus the laws of physics, however, that seems like a rather unsatisfactory answer. For one thing, it leaves me with the question of where the laws of physics came from?

The inventors of these early devices did not perform extensive user based testing (as it often the case in technology; early adopters end up creating standards that others follow, good or bad).<p>The whole point of the article is the Bell labs undertook an extensive user based study to investigate which layouts might be better (Pretty much the first time this testing had been done on this issue).  They tested both canonical forms of the (3x3)+1 layout and selected what we now know today as the telephone layout.  (If I had to speculate as to why this layout performs slightly better than the calculator layout, I might suggest that, in the West, we read left->right and top->bottom and so this is the more natural numbering scheme).<p>Had extensive testing been performed by the original adding machine developers, maybe both devices would use the same layout.<p>Interestingly, the most creative benefit I’ve heard for keeping the calculator layout as it is, is because calculators are often used to sum up real world measurements, and these fall under to purview of Benford’s Law*  Because of this, the keys which are more likely to be used as the leading digits are closer to the at-rest position of the hand and require less energy to move and press … yeah … I’m not convinced either, but it sounds good <p>*  <a href=""http://datagenetics.com/blog/march52012/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://datagenetics.com/blog/march52012/index.html</a>",1440894697

But power does not corrupt everyone equally.<p><pre><code>  As just a middle aged man who has observed many people, including my own behavior; I have honestly found that 99% of the people(men, and women equally) will go along with the crowd/institution as long as it&#x27;s legal, and involves their livelihood.  
</code></pre>
My antidodial observations are mainly from work, or educational enviorments.  I was in a professional school years ago.  (I won&#x27;t mention the profession out of privacy.)<p>The first day of class all the students were bright eyed, and filled with optimism.  Well as time went by it was pretty obvious that the profession was based on antidodial evidence.
I was beyond disillusioned, but kinda knew what I was getting into before paying all that tuition money.  At the time, their  was still enough bad research which confused the the truth that the whole profession was placebo based, or basically a scam.  I noticed all the students, and all, but one Instructor, made up reasons to believe in the program/profession.<p>These students, and teachers financial/educational lives would have been negatively effected if they questioned the profession too much.  So what did my class(around 75 people) do when it became obvious the profession really didn&#x27;t work the way we told, or believed?<p>The students did absolutely nothing!<p>They didn&#x27;t question the bad science the instructors were spewing.  Their was only one student who dared to question the profession, and his eventual livelyhood, as I recall.  The smarter students rationalized, or went onto denial about the profession that was based on basically antidodial evidence, and naieve politicians. Not one student walked away from that program--well one, but for other reasons(nervous breakdown--I recall?).  A married couple was in my class.  Her husband(23?, perfect health) had a stroke on a Sunday afternoon, after getting a treatment from this profession/school.  She showed up on class a few days later.  Her belief/denial was so strong, I don&#x27;t think she even dared to link his death with the school&#x27;s faulty theories?<p>My point is no one dared to question the school/profession.
Their hasn&#x27;t been a week that goes by that I don&#x27;t think about the findings of that Stanford Prision Experiment, and my experience at that school.<p>I have spent over twenty years looking at people in institutions(educational, occupational, personal relationships), and found that most people just go along with the crowd, or institution.  Yes, I have found a few Rebels, but true Rebels--I can literally count on one hand.  By true, I mean calling the institution&#x27;s behavior out, or leaving.<p>The amount of compliance to bad/questionable institutions; I find very depressing.  No, there&#x27;s no utopia, but what people do to other people/environment because they--can, just reminds me how scared/desperate/selfish/malleable, and in some cases just evil we all are?<p>(This is nothing more than my ramblings on my life. It&#x27;s purposely vague, because I don&#x27;t have facts--just antidotal evidence, and observations.  I do think about the intricacies of that study almost daily, and its findings hold up on too many of my life situations/events.  Sorry, about my writing.  I just don&#x27;t have the energy to edit this.  By the way, if you are a true Rebel; you have my praise, and gratitude.  I don&#x27;t recommend fighting the institution if you are poor--you might become homeless?  I was no Rebel.  I was in the 99%.)<p>If you have become Institutionalized by our society; I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with fighting the system in little ways?  Just doing the right thing every once in awhile helps?  Nothing Big, and Dramatic, but truely doing the right thing in a merky situation might help?  Wow--I feel depressed.)",1440894248

On the other hand I would argue that the best piece of advice in this blog post is the development of discipline itself.<p>Developing discipline is difficult and expensive. At the beginning is a hard process. You need to get used to come everyday, sit down and do whatever you are supposed to do. The first few days/weeks you might want to set an special time for your activity. This time slot must be immovable and sacred. As the days go by you will develop a certain dependency on your routine, I call that effect momentum. Once you get a bit of momentum everything becomes easier and very enjoyable.<p>I&#x27;m on the process of developing discipline myself. I come everyday for 1 to 2 hours after my day job, sit down, grab an English etymology book to improve my vocabulary, and do the exercises very methodically. I do this because English is not my first language. The days I don&#x27;t do my work I notice that something is missing, I even feel guilty for not pushing myself to do my daily routine. Using excuses makes my guilt even worse. That&#x27;s why I do my best to not fail my routine.<p>When applied, discipline is a powerful tool to fully develop any of your ideas.

Personally I&#x27;m an engineer turned CTO who used to spend 95% of my time writing code, and now spends 75% of my time on management and &quot;soft&quot; tasks, so I can directly relate to both sides of PG&#x27;s famous Maker&#x27;s vs Manager&#x27;s Schedule.<p>Every employee is going to need different amounts of space to do their job, both due to the role and also because of personality.  While Slack can destroy focus, it actually has less potential to distract you then the people in your office (whether that be colleagues, co-working space people, or roommates/family at home).  In all cases there need to be boundaries and reasonable expectations, and there is no way to set those without some dialogue and empathy happening.<p>Now, full disclosure, my team is distributed between SF and London with a long tail of employees spread in a dozen other countries, so something like Slack is essential to fill in for certain face-to-face communications.  But even setting distributed teams aside, Slack has some of the best notification controls in the comm tools space.  The granularity of the notifications and the configuration options to show/hide/notify different channels and groups give you an amount of control which no other tool I&#x27;ve seen affords.  You definitely have to dig into the Advanced and Channel Prefs in order to really dial this in.  I also use the Mentions tab, and use of Stars on Channels, People and Messages to augment its async capabilities while still staying remarkably available to help where I&#x27;m needed.<p>Of course this is far from a silver bullet and non-trivial to set up, but going back to email would be unthinkable at this stage.  I have pretty sophisticated methods of avoiding distraction in email too, but it is infinitely augmented by telling my team: &quot;if the sky is falling DM me on Slack&quot;.  That way anyone on my team can get ahold of me at any time, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about a bomb in my email inbox.  The problem with email is that literally anyone in the world can email you at any time, and everyone uses email in their own way, so there is no space to come to a common understanding of how to use email.  The only way to win at email is to define on your own terms how you will use it to make <i>yourself</i> the most productive and not letting others&#x27; expectations drive your relationship to email.  One of the reasons Slack is able to &quot;replace&quot; email is because it gives a team a private space to set up their own social norms that is isolated from strangers and other companies who really shouldn&#x27;t have a say in your priorities and time management.",1440893391

10141791,comment,10132067,10134551,0,0,ForPun,,,"That&#x27;s a pretty good advice, I would suggest OP should take it. I have exact same problem and after doing a lot of thinking alone, (yes off time in nature somewhere peaceful helps), I figured most important thing to do is to latch on to the positive side of the things, you have to fight with yourself to think positive, It could be scary but you have to do it and believe, world is a pretty good place. And as PanJaro said, you are among 5%. What you really need is someone in your life who can tell you everyday that you are fine, there is nothing wrong with you and, what you are doing is perfectly good in terms of amount and size, there is no more requirement to do any more, just keep on truckin. What you have is already pretty Good.<p>One more thing that is exceptionally important is to stay away from a lot of click-bait stuff, this will always leave you sad or feeling you lack something, and negative people. Basically anything that can amplify feedback loop of negativity that you are already struggling with.<p>And another most important thing is. Give your mind time to sort itself out. Don&#x27;t force it to think anything, just let it go a little bit. Your mind has noticed that something in your life is not right, and it is trying to figure it out, like a puzzle, that is why it is trying to take you into a cave and curl up, so it can focus all it processing power on that one thing that it is trying to straighten out and squeze the answers and conclusions for future use.",1440893235

That&#x27;s perfectly reasonable and I&#x27;d wager everyone on this thread does exactly the same, not caring too much about chatter not specifically related to them.

Sent directly, that&#x27;ll be a ping and I&#x27;ll respond as soon as I notice which&#x27;ll be in a few seconds.

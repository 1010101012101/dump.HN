Compare that to iTunes which doesn&#x27;t save you any money, it just makes it a whole lot more convenient.  (As an aside, I was far more appalled by the discrepancy between retail albums and iTunes albums: Both cost the consumer $10, but the label gets 5x more from iTunes while the artist gets slightly <i>less</i> than the $1 they get from retail.)<p>You can save the consumer a certain amount of money by cutting out middle-men, but at the end of the day if consumers are paying less money the producers are earning less money.

You can do offline streaming and such for all the music in it. You pay $10/month for the privilege (which I think is fair). $5 or so goes to the company to maintain their servers and such. The other $5 though you can do interesting things with. Basically, each month you have $5 worth of &quot;tip money&quot;. You can send however much money you want to whatever artist you want.. or you could alternatively setup other neat dynamic setups (the author gets 50 cents when you favorite his song, etc). .. The point being that it&#x27;s under the user&#x27;s control. And, if the user chose to not tip any artists this month(or they have left over tip money), then it&#x27;s evenly split between all the artists they listened to for the month (depending on song count or whatever).<p>This model I believe would work because the biggest thing standing in the way from giving your favorite band a tip is that it&#x27;s through services that you are not already using. I don&#x27;t want to go to their website and then sign up for paypal to give them a $1. The thing with this method payment is already accounted for. You already paid. Now you just get to pick which band deserves your money. This could even work with a free version by doing a model like for every 10 ads you must listen to in a month, you get 10 cents added to your tip money..<p>If I knew anything about the music industry, this would be the startup I&#x27;d be behind.

Oil production is declining, but fairly slowly, and natural-gas production has actually been rising. The value of hydroelectric exports has been going up as European demand for &quot;green&quot; electricity allows them to be sold at a premium price.

But I know a lot of physicists that came to programming because of the paucity of jobs for BS Physics, and they were, at the worst, very competent, up to extremely good. I know plenty of others for whom programming is a means to an end - they want to make robots, gather data to answer social questions, or what have you, and the programming is a means to an end.<p>With that said I did find myself wondering whether the author is a programmer, or slings code around. If you have the right kind of mind its not so hard to figure out how to tell the computer to do something, especially with a powerful SW stack; it&#x27;s another thing entirely to deliver, say, 300K lines of code that is readable, robust, maintainable, extensible, and somewhat future proof, or to make the stack itself from the ground up. Of course, many of the &quot;I&#x27;ve been programming since the age of 10&quot; can&#x27;t do that either.<p>And, with that said (:)), I probably share your suspicion of wanting to &#x27;do a start up&#x27;; it&#x27;s hard to throw a stick here (SV) without hitting somebody yacking about a start up. Problem is, &#x27;start up&#x27; is so often the idea. It&#x27;s rarer to hear &quot;I want to build a device to help the blind, I reviewed my options, and VC money turned out to be the best choice for me because...&quot; (VC money is often a terrible option, it depends on your business situation).<p>But I am straying off the subject, which is the blog said to learn to do something, dive in and actually try to accomplish something. I am wholeheartedly behind that. I&#x27;m trying to learn a topic for work, and am reviewing some Coursera courses. And, not getting far - I need to immediately try to apply the ideas to a real problem to get traction, I think.

Companies respond by increasing automation so that they can generate arbitrage profits against the &quot;average&quot; price dictated by the cost of the generation of a unit of the good by their competitors. The other companies catch up, however, and this process itself is deleterious since profit is generated by accumulating the surplus value of the labor embodied in a unit of the commodity. As this process reaches it&#x27;s nadir, the economic character of society is marked by speculation, increasing international tension, and market crashes. Once the fictitious capital that has outstripped the value in the real economy is destroyed, growth can begin anew.

In my 14 years of frequently going out to eat I am hard-pressed to recall even one such instance.<p>I think it is quite peculiar that the service of the server is perceived to be such a profoundly important component to the overall restaurant experience. Think of it this way: have you ever had to report a floor clerk at JC Penny or Sears to the manager, because he ruined your buying experience? Or a McDonald&#x27;s employee or a Taco Bell employee? Front floor people are important, but it&#x27;s probably not fair to place them above people in the background (cooks, dishwashers).<p>This reminds me, my favorite restaurant (Pita Inn in Evanston Illinois) does not even have servers, you just pick your food up, go to the table and eat it.

It seems strange that we&#x27;ve accepted that certain types of businesses (airlines, hotels, ticket brokers, in some cases restaurants) should list prices that differ significantly from the actual price charged.  There does seem to be some backlash against this practice: Kayak, Hipmunk, and many other travel sites now list the full price of airline tickets (though, often, not hotel rooms, with their &quot;facility charges,&quot; whatever those are).  And today I noticed that StubHub now shows prices inclusive of all fees.

Besides the issues it causes for employers that this article covers, I really dislike the power dynamics that it causes for the customers: but maybe not in the way you would think.<p>While the customer may be financially powerful in the relationship, I feel that tipping culture gives power to the server to <i>withhold good service</i> as a punishment or as an optimization strategy at their own discretion. It causes a server to judge you as soon as you walk through the door... will this person give a good tip? Should I ignore them and focus on this other table?<p>The worst part is that the tip happens at the end of the meal after all of the &#x27;costs&#x27; of providing good service are already done.

You start at the beginning, and gradually build your understanding and &quot;symbol-to-concept&quot; mapping table as you go down. Whereas in code, you often just jump in the middle of a file to change something, and you don&#x27;t want to read 1k lines of code in some random place to determine what f(a,b,q(z)) means. Descriptive names allow you to have all the context you need inferable locally.<p>Note that many good principles of programming are exercises in maintaining locality. Reducing program state, functional programming style (function output depends only on inputs, not on hidden state), writing small functions, building abstraction layers (treating one layer as a &quot;programming language&quot; for the layer above) - all of these allow you to understand and change the code you&#x27;re working on without having to look at unrelated things.",1375198136

The waiter (who was most definitely of Japanese ethnicity) angrily demanded if we had a problem with his service, and if we didn&#x27;t, why did we only tip him $2.<p>I don&#x27;t know how closely this sake bar hews to any Japanese convention (my guess is that it&#x27;s be the Japanese version of hipsterism), but it was an amusing episode that led me to never revisit that bar again, as much as I like the place.",1375198067

As a superficial but very visible aspect, we started each day in elementary school by saying a Pledge of Allegiance to the American flag. There was also a strong focus on American civics and history throughout schooling, often with a general tone of American exceptionalism, and a normative view of what it means to be an American. In high school in Texas, this was even supplemented by a normative view of what it means to be a Texan, though those of us not from Nth-generation Texan families tended not to take that part seriously by that age.<p>As far as schooling goes, Denmark is more liberal than the U.S. when it comes to choice, because there are school vouchers (not sure if true in Sweden). If you prefer not to use the state system, you can get a voucher equal to the prorated per-student cost of public education, to spend on private education instead. One of my colleagues uses this to send her daughter to an English-language school, rather than a Danish-language school. The U.S. doesn&#x27;t have any similar program that will let you choose a Spanish-language school over an English-language school (and there is huge political pressure against Spanish-language schooling, because it is seen as a failure to integrate into proper Americanness).",1375197530

I guess it helps that I&#x27;ve been burned more than once when using code from two third parties where party A reached into the &quot;private areas&quot; of party B&#x27;s code. Rather than working with party B to resolve the incompleteness of the solution, they work around it and then push it to everyone.  Later, when party B makes a change (&quot;Hey, it&#x27;s private, and the public interface doesn&#x27;t change!&quot;) and suddenly breaks A&#x27;s code - there are a bunch of un-related other parties which now have a nightmare on their hands.<p>Case in-point (of which there are many, I&#x27;m sure): QExtSerialPort.  The author needed access to underlying Windows functionality that Qt didn&#x27;t publicly provide, however, there was this nice, private header file laying around they could use.  The Qt team later decided they wanted to remove the contents of that file, because no one should ever be using it.  Anyone who wanted to build QExtSerialport had to go and grab the original file, and put it into the correct location.  If they had instead submitted a patch to Qt to fix the problem, many hours would have been saved.<p>The author might get more points with me if they added &quot;keep private usage private,&quot; but instead they are advocating accessing private internals of 3rd party tools in new open-source projects, which restricts the original developer from making changes without impacting users of the third party tools.  Privacy is important - if you want to go around it fine, but you have to expect the price for you and your users, to hand-wave around that is naive at best.",1375197376

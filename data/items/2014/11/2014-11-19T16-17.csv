Two Rails web apps (UI) and three more API Rails apps all talking to a central postgres database.  It is all running on AWS.  My challenge though is that we don&#x27;t have a dedicated DevOps resource and it is a huge challenge to get all the supporting infrastructure working well for dealing with monitoring, logging, exceptions, deployments etc.  It seems like this stuff would be easier just running on Heroku and using a small handful of plugins rather than trying to manage it all ourselves with open source stuff we need to set up (Graylog, Sensu etc).  I hear about people going from Heroku to AWS because of cost, but I wonder if anyone goes the other direction for ease of use?",1416416378

8631125,comment,8629260,8629260,0,0,kyllo,,,"Interesting application of the &quot;rule of least power&quot; to a Rails app. It kind of seems like code commenting on steroids--actually parsing the comments to execute the code that they describe. I&#x27;d be a little concerned about performance overhead for this--have you noticed any effect on the speed of your Rails app from using this?<p>And if the goal is to provide business rules documentation for nontechnical users, why not just comment your code and make an RDoc? I&#x27;m not sure I fully understand what Aristotle buys you over this:<p><pre><code>    #Move to &#x27;to_do&#x27; if the last message changed and is unverified
    request.state = :to_do if request.last_message_id_changed? && request.state != :to_do && !request.last_message.try(:sent?)</code></pre>",1416416364

My general assumption is that anyone who actually does QM for a living knows at least as much as I do, and almost certainly a great deal more.  (Case in point: I presume that QFT is quantum field theory, but what is DFT?)  I prefer to view this as humility rather than passive aggression.  In any case, I don&#x27;t think either one of us should be losing any sleep over it :-)<p>But can we agree that there are states that can be factored, and states that can&#x27;t, and that this is a useful distinction to make?  And that this distinction is <i>physical</i>, i.e. that it produces observable effects?  (And not just observable, but interesting and useful?)",1416416350
8631123,comment,8629885,8631024,0,0,thoughtpolice,,,"I&#x27;m confused by the Window manager comment. As far as I understand, essentially, ConsoleKit development was stopped, and work on systemd-logind etc began as a better way forward, rather than rewriting ConsoleKit.<p>During this timeframe, GNOME developed integration with systemd-logind, similarly to how it developed ConsoleKit support beforehand. And in fact the ConsoleKit backend was supported for a while afterwords. But this is no longer the case as nobody was willing to support it and maintain it in upstream GNOME. So it was removed.<p>So I&#x27;m confused by the comment. Your insinuation seems to be this is somehow the fault of systemd for requiring a shim for things like GNOME, if you want them to work without systemd itself as PID 1. But the reality is that any software which has an API dependency that you want to replace is either going to A) need a shim or B) need a replacement that is also supported by the project. And the ship already sailed on option #2 - ConsoleKit held on until upstream decided to remove the bitrot.<p>I find this line of argument very weird. Indeed, this whole scenario seems to be a story of exactly how FOSS often works and how we envision it to work: people do the work, and in some cases they may compete with or achieve superiority over another project. And other people adopt that work and use it for their own work later on. And people may develop replacements that are or are-not compatible as they see fit.<p>It&#x27;s probably very true that GNOME and systemd developers worked together to reach agreements on systemd-logind, so it could be used by both and they could understand each others needs. But why is it systemd&#x27;s fault if nobody stepped up to maintain ConsoleKit, and systemd&#x27;s fault if GNOME decided to remove support for something they saw as bitrot? Am I missing something extremely key here? Or do you consider this nobody&#x27;s fault and just something that happened?",1416416347

Design is hard to change later, so it&#x27;s important to get it right from the start.<p>Again, I totally buy explicit error propagation. I just think Go&#x27;s solution ends up cluttering your code. It&#x27;s so focused on errors, yet handling isn&#x27;t a first-class construct, and the mechanisms it gives you for dealing with errors aren&#x27;t very good. You have the cast check (a, ok := ...) and you can do a type switch (switch a := err.(type) { ... }), but it&#x27;s rather weak for something that permeates every corner of the language. At least us have pattern matching.<p>I find the stack frame problem disappointing.

Marijuana is a well tolerated drug used by humans for thousands of years.  People are suffering right now, and every day, and most are unable to obtain marijuana to help ease symptoms or for potential cancer fighting abilities.<p>I don&#x27;t care about recreational use.  I though am upset that I have to break the law to treat my cancer and that a family member with a potential recurrence gets told, oh don&#x27;t worry you likely have 8 years before your cancer metastasizes.  And there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it except take estrogen.  Which I believes increases cellular apotosis but comes with other risks.",1416415240

If you, Apple, or anyone else tries to get the government to stop me from doing so, you are in the wrong, even if you try to dress up your intrusion on my personal property with made-up terms like &quot;intellectual property&quot;, EULAs, and whatever other bullshit they come up with.<p>I do think it would be preferable to simply repeal &quot;intellectual property&quot; laws rather than have to try to use things like the GPL to work around them.

They aren&#x27;t really in the business of doing scientific evaluation of the drugs themselves, and I would be surprised if there are any scientists on staff, and if there are, even more surprised if they have any pull.<p>At any rate, the DEA doesn&#x27;t set drug policy, the federal government does.<p>The federal governments&#x27; track record when it comes to controlling substances has not often been in line with scientific or social needs, as is evidenced by the extreme cost of the current war on drugs and the consequent negative effects on society.  For example, cocaine is a refinement of cocoa which was included in things like coca-cola as a mild stimulant.  When it became controlled, smuggling economics came to bear, and thus refining it into cocaine allowed for more value-per-unit-shipment in smuggling.  Being more addictive, and thus worse for society, was a side effect of this.  Worse, with the war on cocaine that occurred an even further refinement was done for the same economic reasons resulting in crack.<p>I posit that if the wellbeing of society were the primary importance for the federal government there would be no drug war, and thus no drug related violent crimes (or very few) and a lot less addiction.",1416414715

8630917,comment,8624979,8629077,0,0,nana_gb,,,"^^^ This is correct, but I will break it down further with the assumption you are starting from zero knowledge.<p>Let&#x27;s say you are buying ads from FB. It&#x27;s common practice to test multiple ads. (Images, Headlines, Ad copy in the body, targeting (who the ads will be shown to).<p>The hope and idea is that one or more of these ads will work better than the rest. It&#x27;s a bit like how YC invests in a lot of startups, not all succeed, the ones that do get more money, the rest run out of cash and go out of business.<p>To help you see which ads are working FB cookies and tracks everyone who clicks your ads. However they don&#x27;t know if a click results in a sale/lead unless you send them confirmation that a sale/lead happened.<p>That&#x27;s where the pixels come in. The term pixel can sometimes be confusing, because these days it&#x27;s usually a snippet of javascript that makes a call to FB. I haven&#x27;t looked at the back end implementation, but I assume the JS loads an image.<p>In short, this allows FB to attribute the sale/lead to a particular ad. With enough data, you can then weed out the ads that are wasting money, and focus on the ones that work. Al lot of time you can optimize further by building out variations of the winning combination.<p>All this is cool, but if you don&#x27;t control the conversion page, and this is the case for 99.999% of affiliates you can&#x27;t place your FB pixel unless the company you are working with provides a means for you to do so. Sometimes it&#x27;s manually done, other times it&#x27;s automate like what Teespring did.<p>QUICK PRIVACY WARNING: Placing a 3rd party pixel code on a conversion page has to potential to leak private information to the 3rd party. This usually happens if your customer&#x27;s info is in the url variables of the page hosting the pixel. When the page loads, all the info is passed to the 3rd party pixel in the referer info.",1416414597

The tricky bit is that there are two major considerations to avoid having the business&#x27; income sourced to the US: (1) permanent establishment, and (2) the IRC 861-863 income sourcing rules.<p>Without going into much detail, permanent establishment generally defines when a business is treated as operating in a country.  The specific conditions are set forth in various tax treaties between the US and other countries. Generally, having an employee residing in the US and working for the business (whether or not as owner) is usually treated as resulting in a US permanent establishment, meaning the business is treated as operating in the US. If you are from a country which does not have a tax treaty with the US, the issue is generally much simpler: does the business have any income-generating operations in the US?<p>The second consideration is sourcing of income.  IRC 861 and 862 define what income is US-sourced and what income is foreign-sourced.  Generally, income from US customers or US payors is US-sourced income, and the same income from foreigners is foreign-sourced.  For income taxation purposes, this distinction doesn&#x27;t matter but it does matter for non-tax purposes.  The H1B restricts the employee from engaging in US employment or business activities, but does not restrict their non-US employment or business activities.<p>A blog hosted on a foreign host, targeting a foreign audience, and earning foreign ad dollars is <i>not</i> a US business and generally should not violate the H1B rules, however you need to talk to an immigration attorney to make sure the analysis applies to the specific blogging activities you would be engaging it.",1416414443

I know it&#x27;s possible because this is how I work.<p>It is unfortunate that avoiding &quot;common code&quot; sometimes involves more effort than just accepting it, but in my experience, once you have invested the time to free yourself from the &quot;common code&quot;, it is gone forever.  I find this to be a very liberating feeling.<p>The idea of &quot;common code&quot; that the user or developer &quot;must&quot; accept is, I think, seen on many levels.<p>From CPU&#x27;s where I get dozens of instructions no program will ever use, 
to computers of all sizes that are pre-loaded with crapware I will never use, 
to operating systems that come with numerous drivers, libraries and programs I will never use, 
where the libraries themselves include dozens of functions never used,
to IDE&#x27;s where that would give me heaps of code that I will never use, 
to programs themselves, often loaded with features I will never use.  I&#x27;m sure there is more but you get the idea.<p>Are there costs to &quot;common code&quot;?<p>For example, I have seen gratuitous features increase attack surface and make programs less secure.  At the least these gratuitous features make the programs more complex.<p>One cost I would argue is time, which I would also argue the world&#x27;s most valuable asset.  But then I also have to invest time to avoid &quot;common code&quot;.<p>I also see the &quot;common code&quot; problem in documentation.  Manuals running in the hundreds or thousands of pages where the needed information could be conveyed succinctly and concisely in a few paragraphs.<p>What is behind this decision to always deliver &quot;the kitchen sink&quot;?  Or maybe there is nothing behind it?  As crypt1d says, it is amusing.<p>I recall many years ago various attempts at obtaining small command line utilities from Microsoft for working with Windows.  In each case the utility was only a few KB.  Yet obtaining the program always involved downloading a &quot;kit&quot; of several hundred MB or, in more recent years, several GB.  Is this intentional?  Mere oversight?  What do you think?<p>Interestingly, the &quot;common code&quot; problem does not appear to have gained a foothold in the context of information retrieval.  Even though users today have ample storage space and processing power to handle bulk data, in fact as much data as they will ever access in their lifetime, they are not usually presented with an option to download &quot;the kitchen sink&quot;.<p>For example, I can download the entire Wikipedia, load it into a database using my database software of choice, wherein all my queries become local.<p>Or I can make each query across the open internet into a third party&#x27;s database software of choice.<p>Obviously, the later approach might be more desirable to the third party as they can record all the queries.  But the former &quot;kitchen sink&quot; approach is more appealing to me since the querying is faster and more reliable.",1416414210

The law assumes that contracts are a big deal for both parties, that they are relatively rare, and that they&#x27;re given attention on both sides.<p>But it&#x27;s hard to get through daily life anymore without signing a ton of contracts. Software update for your phone? Contract. Sign in to some random online service? New T&C I have to agree to i.e. contract. Pay for something with a credit card? That&#x27;s a mini contract you&#x27;re signing.<p>Now, in some cases there&#x27;s no real excuse for not reading a contract. To take a random example, if you sign up for a two-year contract with a cell phone provider and you&#x27;re given a stack of paperwork and you sign without reading through it first, I&#x27;m comfortable saying that&#x27;s on you. This isn&#x27;t something you do often and you have ample opportunity to read the thing first.<p>On the other side of things, Apple keeps tossing these gigantic contracts my way whenever I do much more than breathe. I&#x27;ll literally get fifty or sixty pages of contract when trying to download a software update or just sign into the store after they made some random change to their T&Cs. Nobody reads these things. I know it, you know it, Apple knows it, and because of that they should be strongly limited in what they can do.<p>I think an important test for a contract should be asking the hypothetical question, &quot;what if everyone who signed it read through it in detail first?&quot; For something like buying a house, this would obviously change nothing. For a cell phone contract, it would change little. For random gigantic software EULAs and web site T&Cs and similar things, it would drive all the customers away. If having everyone read through it before signing it would break the process the contract was made for in the first place, the contract shouldn&#x27;t be valid.",1416413818

Whereas finding an element by ID is literally just a single lookup in an index regardless of where the element actually appears.<p>Best I&#x27;m aware this was true until browsers all supported getElementsByClassName:<p><a href=""http://caniuse.com/#feat=getelementsbyclassname"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caniuse.com/#feat=getelementsbyclassname</a><p>The only material difference between that and looking up a DOM ID is that the first yields an array (of a potentially wide range of tags) instead of a single element.<p>Plus, as already highlighted in a separate comment, `div.class a` or `div#id a` will both work the DOM tree from every `a` element up (just like describe) anyway.",1416413720

This is mostly just to allow users to be able to understand each other and to help automatically catch alternate latinizations so you find out &quot;Hey, he already registered under a latinized-spelling name&quot;.<p>The second is glyph similarity.  This is the security concern where you have two glyphs that are graphically similar but phonetically completely different, but can easily be mistaken for each other.  These glyphs are used to trick and confuse users.  The first kind of check won&#x27;t catch these, but they&#x27;re the reason we don&#x27;t have unicode in domain names.<p>Probably a correct system would have a very liberal interpretation of glyph similarity and would treat strings as matched when they contain similar glyphs.",1416412926

Time well spent.<p>Long live SDKs, APIs and other ways to get a product out the door without coding every bit myself.<p>Fun teamwork results from these side projects also.  Such as my wife recording her custom mix of &quot;Old McDonald&quot; + &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot; to be used as my background music for the game.

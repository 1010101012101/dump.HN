In addition to being slightly skeezy and potentially queering expectations on future projects, doing this also has the practical risk of putting you on the hook for additional work if your client starts aggressively project managing you; after all, they bought the time.<p>Another way (also skeezy, I think) firms play this game is to double-book and have teams juggle multiple projects, thus genuinely spreading the hours on the project out while keeping effort constant.<p>I really think the thing to do is to be upfront; if your rates are raising, they're raising. If your customers want to mitigate that risk, they can pay for it: pre-buy time commitments at a discount from your current rate. I think advanced purchase is a more effective (and more professional) lever to use than rustproofed hourly quotes.",1313953170

Most systems of government can work at small scale. They don't break until you get lots of people. The whole thing should also wind up being more stable socially.<p>Agreed.<p>>They really need to be sovereign, or they're just big cruise ships. They need to have complete ownership of the platforms, which almost means they need to be donated.<p>No it doesn't.  They can be sold, either as real estate or to groups of people who want to administrate them.<p>>Obviously sinking is a big risk. Make sure there are well-drilled emergency procedures, and that the links between platforms are such that one sinking will not bring down any others. And keep lifeboats and dual citizenship, so if it goes south you'll have somewhere to go when they pick you out of the ocean.<p>Obviously the people moving there should educate themselves on whether the platforms are resilient to turbulent weather.  They can bring their own safety equipment (lifeboats, etc.) or perhaps the owner/seller of the platform will include it as part of the rental/sale arrangement.  These aren't hard problems to solve without some kind of centralized paternalist entity.

They lead to waterfall-esque development, since your only shot at avoiding scope creep is to catch everything up-front. Plus, change requests feel like nickel and diming to the client, slow the project down, and are just generally bad service.<p>Hourly billing is difficult to sell: would you buy a house, knowing that the sale price might increase by 30% after you moved in? Plus, you run into the problem of those hours not being tied to a productivity level.<p>We've started giving high-level estimates of projects up front, but not committing to a specific scope or price. Instead we invoice for each 2-week sprint with set deliverables. This way, the client is paying for features, not time. We start a feature backlog at the beginning of a project, but add in much more detail right before each sprint starts. The client always knows what they're buying, and we can quickly tell if we're running ahead or behind on the project based on whether we are finishing sprints early, and how many features we are knocking off.<p>By not getting married to one feature-set at the beginning of the project, it also allows us to throw in 'nice-to-haves' that might be easier than expected, or scale back less important features if they turn out to be more complicated than we thought. It does add time for communication and managing the backlog, of course. We have a dedicated project manager and a QA lead to keep this stuff away from our development team, otherwise they might have all gone mad by now.",1313952040

Sometimes these forms are completely different, /and/ there are very specific rules that specify which form to use depending on the letter it follows.

It applies here, not with what was explicitly stated, but an underlying assumed view.  It is assumed that arguing against spending current amount X of money on science, means arguing for not spending any at all. Obviously that would be bad, because we wouldn't have the current benefits.  In fact, we can also spend somewhere in between 0 and X (e.g. X/2) or even more than X.  We'll get some non-zero amount of benefits for these, and it's not as clear that it's worse off, unlike spending nothing.",1313950664

Most systems of government can work at small scale. They don't break until you get lots of people. The whole thing should also wind up being more stable socially.<p>I really like the idea of ocean-going governmental experiments. Let's have socialist experiments and parecon experiments while we're at it. They really need to be sovereign, or they're just big cruise ships. They need to have complete ownership of the platforms, which almost means they need to be donated.<p>Obviously sinking is a big risk. Make sure there are well-drilled emergency procedures, and that the links between platforms are such that one sinking will not bring down any others. And keep lifeboats and dual citizenship, so if it goes south you'll have somewhere to go when they pick you out of the ocean.<p>I suspect that even if the first few iterations of this idea suck and/or are used for crass commercial purposes, it will likely get ironed out eventually.

But not the complete idea behind it. If it were, then slowly the whole field would converge to publishing ""safe"" ideas so lesser and lesser of it gets torn apart. Because torn apart means rejection of papers (which translates to no research done). The complete cycle of science involves:<p><pre><code>  1. Understanding the different ideas and problems that are out there.
  2. Manifesting a different perspective on the matter.
  3. Understanding and experimenting with this perspective.
  4. Publishing the result 
  5. Gaining feedback and talking to people about the results.
  6. Continue.

Charging $200/hour for an open-ended project is challenging to get any client to accept. Charging $x/hour for a 3-4 week iteration (where the deliverable is a functional, but not necessarily complete, piece of software) is much easier.<p>I have been burned so many times by fixed-rate projects that I generally turn the work down every time the client insists on it. It throws the alignment of the developer and the client completely out of whack, takes away the paltry amount of leverage that the developer has over the project, and it basically assumes that you won't run into unknown unknowns. This means it's terrible for the developer, but it's actually quite a bad deal for the client as well.<p>Fixed-rate coding assumes that software development is at the same general level of predictability as having the oil changed in your car.",1313950112
2909756,comment,2908932,2908932,1,0,chancho,,,"Just to pile on: 0-based indexing is also more convenient when you want to build a multi-dimensional array from a one-dimensional array primitive using the integer division and modulo operators to map between 1D and nD indices. E.g., a  matrix with M rows and N columns can be mapped to the range 0 <= i < (NxM) by letting i = (row * N) + col, and the backward mapping is row = i / N, col = i % N.<p>If instead you use 1 <= i <= (NxM), 1 <= row <= M, 1 <= col <= N, then the mappings aren't nearly as clean. Sure, you could hide all this behind some kind of API, eg. Image.getPixel(x,y), but if you work with multidimensional arrays very often, eventually you'll need to marshal arrays back and forth between different containers that use different access APIs, and the simplest common representation to use for this kind of data is as a 1D array, so being able to work with nD data that is stored in a 1D array comes up fairly often.",1313950105

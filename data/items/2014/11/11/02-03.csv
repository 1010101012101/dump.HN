You can put people on the dark/light edge of Mercury and find a pretty good temperature. A tiny solar panel can generate gobs of power. There are minerals worth mining on Mercury.<p>Because Mars has no magnetosphere all habitable structures will have to be well underground to protect against radiation.

8588047,comment,8584558,8587669,0,0,gjm11,,,"There are plenty of situations in which reference cycles would be perfectly sensible (and not at all &quot;sloppy&quot;) ways to organize your data if it weren&#x27;t for reference counting.<p>For example: suppose you are writing some code that analyses a strategy game. You have (let&#x27;s say) an object representing a position in the game; each position object has references to the positions you can move from there to. If repeated positions are possible, then you have a reference cycle.<p>For example: you have a tree-like structure in which things contain other things. It&#x27;s convenient for each thing to have a reference to its parent, and for each thing to have references to its children. Boom, reference cycles everywhere.<p>For example: you are implementing a programming language that has closures. So each closure object has a reference to its lexical environment, and some of the things in that environment may themselves be closures defined in that environment. Reference cycles. (The same happens if you have classes, and methods have references to the class where they&#x27;re defined.)<p>Of course, all these things can be avoided. Often you can pick some subset of the references (e.g., the parent pointers) and make them weak references, or you can restructure your code to make some of the references go away (e.g., positions don&#x27;t have references to their successors, they have methods/functions for generating them). But <i>the only reason to do those things is that you need to avoid reference cycles</i>. Refcounting isn&#x27;t (in these cases) kindly helping you improve your code by forcing you to avoid sloppy constructs; it&#x27;s taking what would otherwise be perfectly sensible code, <i>making</i> it sloppy, and then forcing you to do something else to avoid the resulting memory leaks.",1415674547

8587999,comment,8583959,8587051,0,0,gjm11,,,"Yup, there&#x27;s an exact solution. It turns out that the volume of the n-dimensional unit ball is pi^(n/2) / (n/2)!. (The factorial function generalizes to numbers that aren&#x27;t integers. For half-integers you get a rational number times sqrt(pi). E.g., if n=3 then we need (3/2)! which happens to equal 3/4.sqrt(pi), so the volume is 4/3.pi.)<p>So for large n we can use Stirling&#x27;s approximation. To make the formulas a little shorter I&#x27;ll write m=n/2. Then the volume of the unit n-ball is<p>V(n) = pi^m/m! ~ pi^m (e/m)^m 1/sqrt(2.pi.m)<p>whereas the volume of the smallest n-cube containing that ball is 2^n, so the ratio is<p>R(n) ~ (pi.e/2m)^m / sqrt(2.pi.m)<p>where, remember, m=n/2. Actually, at this point maybe it&#x27;s nicer to put things back in terms of n:<p>R(n) ~ sqrt[(pi.e/n)^n/pi.n]<p>When n is large, you should see this as<p>R(n) ~ sqrt[(..../n)^n.....]<p>where the &quot;....&quot;s are the less important bits. So for large n this is going to get small.<p>Concrete not-so-large-n example: let&#x27;s take n=10. Then R(10) ~= sqrt((pi.e/10)^10/10pi) which happens to be about 0.081. That&#x27;s pretty accurate -- the exact answer is pi^5/3840, which is about 0.0797. So if you fit a 10-ball snugly inside a 10-cube it&#x27;ll take up about 1/12 of the space.<p>What if we crank the dimension up? With n=100 the ratio is about 2x10^-55. (A naive Monte Carlo simulation will be unable to distinguish this from zero.) So if you do the ball-inside-cube thing in 100 dimensions, the ball occupies less than one billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billionth of the volume of the cube.<p>High-dimensional cubes are really, really spiky.",1415673874

8587921,comment,8587697,8587697,0,0,danso,,,"Some useful context about Page&#x27;s programming abilities from Steven Levy&#x27;s book, &quot;In the Plex&quot; (which, IMO, is a must-read, as much fun if not better than the Jobs biography):<p>> Since Page wasn’t a world-class programmer, he asked a friend to help out. Scott Hassan was a full-time research assistant at Stanford, working for the Digital Library Project program while doing part-time grad work. Hassan was also good friends with Brin, whom he’d met at an Ultimate Frisbee game during his first week at Stanford.<p>> Page’s program “had so many bugs in it, it wasn’t funny,” says Hassan. Part of the problem was that Page was using the relatively new computer language Java for his ambitious project, and Java kept crashing. “I went and tried to fix some of the bugs in Java itself, and after doing this ten times, I decided it was a waste of time,” says Hassan. “I decided to take his stuff and just rewrite it into the language I knew much better that didn’t have any bugs.” He wrote a program in Python—a more flexible language that was becoming popular for web-based programs—that would act as a “spider,” so called because it would crawl the web for data. The program would visit a web page, find all the links, and put them into a queue. Then it would check to see if it had visited those link pages previously. If it hadn’t, it would put the link on a queue of future destinations to visit and repeat the process.<p>> Since Page wasn’t familiar with Python, Hassan became a member of the team. He and another student, Alan Steremberg, became paid assistants to the project. Brin, the math prodigy, took on the huge task of crunching the mathematics that would make sense of the mess of links uncovered by their monster survey of the growing web. Even though the small team was going somewhere, they weren’t quite sure of their destination. “Larry didn’t have a plan,” says Hassan. “In research you explore something and see what sticks.”<p>Levy, Steven (2011-04-12). In The Plex (p. 18). Simon & Schuster, Inc..

I&#x27;m only disputing that the Chagossians have some sort of fundamental human right to return all these years later, just because their grandfathers used to live there.<p>2) Yes, many leading philosophers of previous centuries used to think very highly of property rights, but this trend has greatly diminished in the last 50 years or so, especially in Anglo-American political philosophy.<p>In any case, I&#x27;m pretty sure that if I offered a significant premium over the prevailing market price, most people will be happy to sell their home and move elsewhere. Especially if I also offered to cover their cost of moving and lost wages while they look for a new job. (That&#x27;s roughly what I think every government should offer when they need to relocate people.)<p>3) I totally agree. It was wrong for the UK to move them without their consent. But what is done is done, and now it&#x27;s time to ask what to do about it.<p>If I break your phone, property rights mean that you have the right to make me compensate for your material losses. It doesn&#x27;t mean that you have the right to make me restore your broken phone to its original condition, no matter how much sentimental value it might have had for you.<p>4) That&#x27;s a genuine problem. If it is impossible to ensure an equal or greater quality of life for the relocated population, perhaps that&#x27;s a good reason not to relocate them in the first place. On the other hand, I find it hard to believe that a country like UK would be unable to arrange a fantastic life (at least materially) for a few hundred islanders no matter where in the world they were. They were simply unwilling to do it, just as they were unwilling to consult the locals before deciding to lease Chagos to the Americans.<p>tl;dr: Something very bad happened.

The TrueType font format apparently does specify an underline position and height [1], though there&#x27;s no mention of any allowance for this descender-dodging feature. The fact that font formats defer the actual drawing of the underline to the renderer gives me some hope. This seems to highlight the issue of web browsers having different font rendering needs from other apps, since underlining is so much more prevalent.<p>[edit] Obviously, it&#x27;s a lot easier to fix this issue with a single font, as Apple has done in Messages, than to fix it well in every font.<p>With regards to this implementation, I&#x27;d rather not have to worry about the background, font and select background colors for every link.

If you teach cardholders that a URL will save them from getting phished, they&#x27;ll get phished. This is analogous to, though quite a bit worse than, the idea that a logo guarantees authenticity, even in our current regime.

A better one is probably a gated community (which Wikipedia tells me is rare in Australia, unfortunately, so it may not be a good one for you).<p>The cast of this little play is as follows:<p>Netflix (played by amazon).<p>L3, Akamai: Played by UPS and FedEx<p>Comcast: played by the community association<p>You live in the gated community.  You pay the association that runs the gated community for upkeep of the roads within the gate.  Part of this includes a guard who lets delivery vehicles in.<p>Delivery vehicles used to be relatively low volume, but Amazon becomes popular, and all of the sudden UPS trucks are coming in a lot; as in to the point where the association needs to hire a second guard to let them in.  The association refuses to do it unless UPS pays a monthly fee.<p>Around this time, the community association starts its own online store which residents can by from without any shipping delays.<p>Meanwhile, FedEx (which enters the community via a different gate) is having no trouble with deliveries.  Amazon notices this and starts using FedEx in addition to UPS to solve the problem.  Unfortunately the same pattern as with UPS happens.<p>People start complaining to Amazon and UPS, which results in a blog article from UPS talking about how the Community Association wants them to pay extra for more gates into the community; this makes no sense for 2 reasons:<p>1) The CA is there to serve the residents, and the residents are the ones who ordered from Amazon<p>2) Traditionally the CA pays for any infrastructure improvements within the gate, primarily due to #1<p>So the CA which is supposed to be serving the interests of those living within it is now abusing its status as gatekeeper to charge Amazon for the privilege of delivering packages to it.<p>This finally gets resolved with Amazon, under protest, paying to put a shipping warehouse within the gate, which is something they had earlier offered to do without charge.",1415671531

If you read closely, the article says: &quot;The Chagossians are largely descended from African slaves brought to the previously uninhabited islands, 2,200km (1,367 miles) north-east of Mauritius, by the French in the 18th century.&quot;<p>Yes, these unfortunate souls have suffered generations of evil, starting with the slave trade and finish off with being expelled from the island(s). That said, I don&#x27;t really see the argument that it is somehow their land. Should they have been properly compensated or better yet relocated somewhere with better conditions than what they had? Absolutely! In fact, it seems that a law suite seeking that compensation might have better luck than trying to reclaim the land.<p>The example used earlier with the Balkans is so much more complicated. Depending on who&#x27;s side of history you take, all sides have a claim to most of the land in the Balkans. Things seem to be much more clear cut here.",1415671510

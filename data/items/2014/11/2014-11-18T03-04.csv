On a pure physical level it is very safe. Psychologically the reality is more mixed. If used in moderation with some sense of responsibility, it can be neutral or even beneficial. But &quot;acid casualties&quot; really are a thing. Heavy, irresponsible abuse of LSD and similar drugs can really destroy a person&#x27;s mind. I&#x27;ve seen people who really abused these things and sort of never came back.<p>While there appears to be no conventional toxicity, it would not surprise me to learn later that there is some potential for harm at the neurological level. If so it might be more a result of trauma or stress due to the effects of abuse than direct toxicity. In any case the abusers I saw did seem mentally impaired, in some cases never recovering.<p>So when someone asks me about these things, I always tell them to do a lot of homework on them and to be very careful. I say the same thing to people who want to play with stimulants or nootropics. In general extreme care and self awareness should be exercised when putting anything into your body, especially if it affects your mind.<p>Most of the people from the psychedelic world who seem to have their heads screwed on seem to advocate their use rarely, under careful setting, with at least one other experienced person that you trust, and a lot of introspection and time in between to integrate the experience.<p>Anecdotally harm seems to occur when recklessness precludes integration, as if not processing the experience leads to some kind of overload and trauma. It may be a form of burnout leading to something like PTSD, which can actually manifest physical brain damage. Look up some of the stuff on child abuse and PTSD victims and neurological effects.<p>On the upside, I have seen dramatic evidence that these things can lead to deep positive breakthroughs. They might also be able to act as &quot;steroids for creativity,&quot; allowing extreme feats of lateral integration that are hard to even imagine in ordinary consciousness. These compounds are fascinating and powerful tools that should be studied with care. They should neither be marketed recklessly as enlightenment in a pill or ignorantly banned by fear-mongering reactionaries.",1416283120

That part is great, if you want to make a functional imperative declarative loosely strongly typed language then hey, go for it.<p>But I think one has a responsibility not to try and sell one&#x27;s project as something it&#x27;s not, which especially means being careful with claims. I know this is sometimes hard because a lot of language design stuff comes from the academic community which notoriously overclaims (because it is their job to overclaim), and it is easy for that culture to rub off.<p>But if you are going to say something like &quot;just by doing this our code becomes 200% better&quot;, with a straight face, about something that most practitioners know is going to be terrible in most cases without a tremendous amount of additional work and solving of unsolved problems (solution not shown), you&#x27;re just telling the reader that they can&#x27;t take you seriously.

We&#x27;re not talking about determining sex (male or female), we&#x27;re talking about determining gender (masculine or feminine or whatever) from a name. On that basis, the proposed rename makes sense. (The whole sex / gender thing is one of my language pet-peeves. Ask me about &quot;male toilets&quot; sometime ...)<p>But: this is also completely ridiculous (using the term precisely). It&#x27;s on a par with putting &#x27;trigger warnings&#x27; in University-level course material. If as a society we can&#x27;t deal with the word &#x27;sex&#x27; in a library name, we are fucked (using the term ironically). It feels as though we are descending back into some sort of parallel-universe Victorian prudery. The last time this happened, apricocks became apricots, haycocks became haystacks, and a hundred years later everyone was laughing at the stupidity and childishness of it.<p>How did feminism become the new prudery?

I enjoyed it for how it incorporated alternate history in our relatively recent past - imagine a world in which the Inca and Imperial Japanese kingdoms became the dominant superpowers and led the industrial revolution, Europeans were conquered and fast forward into far future world with aliens, FTL space travel all mixed with what the Inca and Japanese cultures might have evolved into in that context and how those of European descent were seen as the lower caste.

What&#x27;s at question is how many people actually are inclined to ever care about something like this, and the answer is almost nobody. Very few people care to reencode their audio files.<p>> <i>Why so? Is it some kind of stereotype that Apple customers don&#x27;t care about quality of music or can&#x27;t be audiophiles?</i><p>Why do you leap to the worst possible assumption about everything Apple? You seem to have an extremely strong bias here.<p>Most Apple customers probably buy their music from the iTunes Music Store and don&#x27;t ever think about reencoding it, because there&#x27;s no point. Similarly, most people who buy music from other stores get it already encoded in a lossy format appropriate for listening to. Far and away the biggest reason to be reencoding is when ripping music from an audio CD, and iTunes already supports that. Once ripped, there&#x27;s no reason to go about reencoding it again, as we&#x27;ve already long since passed the point where people can discern a difference.<p>The only really legitimate reason to be caring about this sort of thing is when you&#x27;re doing professional audio work (as opposed to mucking about with music for personal listening), and people who are doing professional audio work aren&#x27;t using iTunes for this work anyway so that&#x27;s pretty irrelevant.<p>> <i>Adding FLAC support in their QuickTime framework is</i> trivial.<p>That&#x27;s absurdly naive. It would be practically criminal negligence for Apple to download the latest libFLAC and drop it into the OS they ship to millions of customers without spending significant engineering resources reviewing the code. Then there&#x27;s the ongoing maintenance burden, of dealing with upstream changes, local bugfixes, and just plain integration with the rest of the QuickTime stack. And if iTunes supports it, then iPhones and iPads really ought to support it if it&#x27;s at all possible, and that&#x27;s a really large engineering effort to do so in a way that&#x27;s power-efficient, if that&#x27;s even possible (given the lack of hardware support for it).<p>And that&#x27;s just what comes to mind off the top of my head. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s more that would be involved as well.<p>And for what? What would you gain from having iTunes support FLAC? You should be transcoding into some other format already for actual use in listening, because there&#x27;s no point in carrying around large lossless files for personal listening, especially if you use any mobile devices (or laptops). You don&#x27;t need iTunes to support FLAC just to transcode it, you already have options there, and as long as you aren&#x27;t transcoding to Ogg Vorbis then your resulting file should work in iTunes (and on iPhones and iPads).",1416280242

So they&#x27;re expecting between 5.6% and 6.1% nominal annual return over the long term.<p>Nobody ever invests an entire endowment in bonds; even aside from the lower rate of return, the inflation risk is much too dangerous.",1416279895

It is really not surprising whatsoever that opening a grocery store in a food desert did not reduce BMI in the community in 6 months.<p>From my perspective, you are using the veil of rationality to advance an intellectually dishonest and morally bankrupt argument. When I encounter a line of argument like yours, I find that it is nearly certain the other individual has little personal experience with underserved communities or individuals. I challenge you to any first-hand work in truly underserved American communities. The vast majority of these people are not simply lazy or lacking in impulse control, but are stuck in a socioeconomic feedback loop.",1416279861

218538,comment,218226,218226,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"EDIT: This was a very poor post, but I think there's enough in there to discuss (aside from the awful first amendment stuff and the rhetorical rambling that went on -- please, learn to structure your arguments!)<p>I'd like to bring up one interesting point: Karma shouldn't matter -- yet the entire site is built on karma: who has more can downmod comments, top posters are regularly identified, all sorts of fun articles come out about how karma relates to posting style, etc.<p>You can't have a karma system and then say ""but it doesn't mean something"" Surely it's not the end-all or the greatest thing ever created, but the entire reason karma works is that it has some value to the users.<p>So however the discussion proceeds, can we please get beyond this ""but karma shouldn't matter when you post"" That's like saying it's okay to lose a couple of points in tennis if you're having a good time. It's a true statement, but it does not describe how one plays tennis. (instead it describes how having fun is more important than the rules, which is true of all sorts of things) If we're going to discuss one particular rule/moderation system, then such comments are unhelpful, imo.",1213613673

It even uses the same color and font. Can this be linked to PG once working in Yahoo or does it just stand for YCombinator? I am really curious, any hints?",1213613612

218533,comment,218322,218380,0,0,rms,,,"If I paypal you the $10 can I get beta access to your games for the next year? It feels like a much better deal if you commit to making future episodic content or if there are community tools to make new levels. Maybe puzzle rooms that you have to reclear until you solve? I think building a level editor is the next logical step and this is a great game mechanic to develop further.",1213612858

218530,comment,218425,218458,0,0,ardit33,,,"ok, good point  :)   So, basically limitVolume is used to push the implementation of the that scenario up the food chain, to the player itself.  How about when I want to set the volume exactly 50,  depending on certain triggers.<p>What if I have no control on the videoPlayer, (third party), and now I am limited only on the scenarios they thought were ok to implement?<p>I guess, that's the point of the author, to enforce encapsulation,  but by limiting the actions to only  ""verbs"", the author is restricing the user of that object to what he thinks he should be doing.<p>Basically, the author is limiting my ability to do things the author didn't thought I needed.<p>It is like pushing implementation up, and, limiting what users can do.  It will probably be a system with less bugs, but also a cripled one.",1213612445
218529,comment,218425,218425,0,0,dhimes,,,"The author is mistaken.  You should have no getters and setters <i>of primitive data types</i>.  There should be no<p>private String custName;<p>public String get custName(){...}<p>public set custName(String cn){...}<p>The way to handle this situation is to make a custID object that contains custName, and allows you to add custAvatar, custNumber, etc., as needs change and grow.  Then it's ok to have getters and setters for the custID object.<p>I often find that my ""data"" objects (custID in the above) have all public variables (that is, custName is public, custID is public, etc.).  I find it preposterous to have private variables and public getters and setters that do no ""processing"" of the input.<p>The reason for encapsulating this way is that if, two years later, you find your needs change and you need other information attached to the ""customer,"" you don't break your old contracts.  It's easy to add data to the data object for the objects that now need them, and for the others to ignore it.",1213612384

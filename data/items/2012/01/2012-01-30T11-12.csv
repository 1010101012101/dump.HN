They're only good for memorization, and if you're memorizing something that you need to use, using it is a -lot- better than using an SRS.<p>Plus, memorizing complex things with via SRS isn't easy.  Figuring out how to break down the cards into small enough pieces is really hard for any non-trivial information.<p>For instance, I tried to use it to study for the PHP Cert from Zend.  I passed the test, but only because I spent so much time researching to make the cards.  The actual studying of the cards was pretty much useless after having done the real work of making the cards.<p>I tried to use it for studying languages, but I've found that the time making the cards is pretty much wasted (it's copy and paste, no thought involved) and studying them beyond the first few reps is pointless, too.  If I can get through a few reps, and I'm actively using the language, there's no need to continue doing reps beyond that.  I'm better off letting someone else make the list, study them like normal flashcards a few times, and then throw them away.  (Better yet is something like iKnow that has the word, translation, picture and sentence.)<p>In the end, I've never actually found a use case for an SRS system that wasn't trumped by something else either because of easiness or just being better.",1327923825

3528325,comment,3525544,3527401,2,0,IgorPartola,,,"There are two ""bite you in the ass"" points about ORMs that I am talking about. The first is writing ineffecient SQL which as you mention may typically be avoided by reading all queries. The second is  the RAM and CPU required by the ORM. When you require massive concurrency and very small response times, SQLAlchemy simply requires too many resources. There is no way to avoid that.<p>I agree that loading rows one by one and hard-coding their relationships into you business logic is not the most convenient thing. However, the point of SQL is not really to let you say ""zoo.animals"". The point is: you ask it questions and it returns answers. Where ORMs break down is where you start talking about aggregate rows or complex computed properties. What do you mean, sometimes animal has property potential_mates_with_offspring_count and sometimes it does not?<p>Yes any ORM that uses lazy evaluation will suffer from the issue above. That is why I am not a fan of any ORM. Instead, a carefully written and thought through data access layer is much more scalable and may provide true abstraction of your data storage mechanism.<p>Lastly, no zoo.animals is not guaranteed to be cached, since it may be a declared attribute. The session is not a cache so you cannot rely on it for that.",1327923595

Here's a little secret from a 43yo programmer making the best $$$ of his career. MOST SOFTWARE IS NOT BUILT BY SOFTWARE COMPANIES.<p>Sure, everyone knows about Google, and Facebook, and for my fellow genXers, Microsoft. The truth is though, the code that gets written at those companies and other software companies like them is a tiny fraction of the all code that gets written.<p>All over the economy, companies that are NOT software companies are writing code to DO STUFF. Sure Facebook is highly visible, 'valued at 100 BEEELLLIION dollars', and what all the cool kids are into. But really, who gives a shit about a feed of photos and asinine updates. Yes, it's like soap operas. Always popular, always mildly profitable, and if it disappeared tomorrow, the economy wouldn't notice.<p>Real companies, on the other hand, need to build software to improve their business. Your productivity at those companies will depend on you getting some 'Domain Knowledge'. Yes, I know it's like getting your hands dirty, but if you want to prosper in software development as you get older, then you will need to add domain knowledge to your skill set.<p>Ah! But which domains? Pick the hardest ones, is my advice. Ten years ago I would have said Financial Markets, but we are coming to the end of that gravy train. Financial Markets is a hard domain. It's difficulty makes it very difficult to find programmers who understand the domain enough to be productive, hence programmers who do have that knowledge are in very high demand. And no, they don't give a shit about how old you are.<p>In the future, I think the fields of bio-informatics, robotic control, logistics, traffic control (and other N-P hard problems) will present great opportunities for older programmers to find niche domains to excel at and add longevity to your programming career.<p>If you are young and you want to try your hand at a startup, do it now. If it works out, more power to you. If not, and you want to build a long career in software development, then find difficult and complex domains/industries and learn about them, because even if they don't build software now, they will in the future, and for that they are going to need programmers who understand the domain, not domain experts that can hack together some code.",1327923198

Certainly, government did something; the effective banning of factory towns (through banning scrip and mandatory rental), in particular, was very important.

There is no mention of a FOI application, which I'm not even sure two foreigners are entitled to.<p>2) The two posing clowns are just that kind you would expect to be the butt of jokes.

The problem isn't setting up OpenSSH to offer chrooted sftp access. My gripe is that the sftp subsystem for no solid reason requires that a user directory is root-owned in order to chroot even when the user account experiences a forced sftp response (that is, denying shell access, making it an sftp-only account).",1327921777

It certainly wasn't as hysterical, but ""don't talk to strangers"" was definitely boilerplate parenting.  Of course it's impossible to really get in my own head as a 10-year-old, but I think I internalized the message more or less appropriately as ""not everyone is bad, but keep your wits about you"".<p>Later when I got on BBSes and then usenet/irc there wasn't really an adult in my life who had a clue what the Internet was (other than something that annoyingly tied up the phone line and induced nerd rage when they picked it up :), but I was talking to all kinds of strangers and rightly felt totally safe because what I was doing was just <i>on the internet</i>.

This makes it much easier to recall and use in familiar ways.<p>The corollary is my personal hypothesis that learning Latin actively helps you learn other European languages. In fact, learning French probably makes it easier to learn German, and knowing both gives you more background on which to build the English language. Eventually the limiting factor is memory and ability to differentiate language in context.",1327921666

It's not necessarily technical stuff or stuff you'l explicitly use when you find a job, but you do and learn things that will come back to you at some point in time.<p>I got my current job because of the project I did to get my degree, it was exactly what my company was looking for, and I never did it to have more chances to find a job, I did it because it was fun.<p>Also, by boss once told me this: ""Degrees don't matter that much, the actual <i>work</i> that you are able to do does. However, given 2 subjects with sane skill set I'd pick the one that fiched college, because that shows that he could commit to a 'project' and finish it."" . I found it interesting.<p>Last, there is one thing which we (humans) can't recover (appart from death): time.

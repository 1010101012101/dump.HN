What's complicated about that?<p>Re: implementation, it of course depends on the application.  The key difficulty is having an inverse (undo) for every mutating operation you have.  This may get tricky to do efficiently for some applications (video editing comes to mind).  An additional complication may come from, e.g., undoing every word rather than every keystroke.  So you need some provision for gathering 'small' actions that you don't care for saving separately in history.  <p>The history itself is nothing more than a list.<p>Now, I understand how it can be very hard to retrofit this functionality in an app that was made without this in mind.  I'm redoing a hobby project from scratch because of this.<p>Anyway, care to give details on the complications you've found?  I'm not trying to convince anyone it's easy; I'm trying to help, and maybe gain a better understanding of the problems in the process.",1184687846

That said, I have a suggestion: get rid of the dot in the ""o"" in the word focus, and make the letters on either side of the ""o"" progressively more blurry (sorry if that makes no sense, I'm not sure how else to describe it).",1184687371

Users of the free and highly functional free version still benefit from many great features, such as exchanging large files and even entire folders with each other (all exchanges are encrypted).<p>-----------------------------------<p>About GigaTribe:<p>GigaTribe is great new software that allows you to share specific folders on your computer with friends & family located anywhere there is an internet connection. Only the users you have invited will see the folders (and files) you share. All exchanges are strongly encrypted, so your privacy is guaranteed! Interrupted exchanges automatically resume with no data loss. Define users groups to share distinct folders with distinct groups. Multi-source download is also available to increase your download speed. It's 100% safe (256-bit blowfish encryption), huge files can be transferred (no-limit!) and it's easy to set up. Can also be used to access one's PC from a remote location. No spyware or adware!",1184686797

34777,comment,34746,34763,0,0,euccastro,,,"For some applications, it's not a big deal if only the latest action can be undone.  This already beats warning dialogs, which is the point in the article.<p>Next step (I'll call this B, below) is keeping a linear undo history, which you can navigate one step at a time, like most text editors today.  This doesn't bring any of the complications you mention here.<p>One way to get more sophisticated is exposing a linear undo history a la Photoshop, from which you can remove intermediate old steps.  This seems to work for Photoshop, but in general it sounds like a can of worms, for the reasons you mention.<p>Another path up from B is to keep an undo history <i>tree</i>, with the following properties:<p>- You can display the tree explicitly somehow, and navigate it.  So, e.g., selecting a node shows you the state of your content at that time.<p>- You never delete nodes or branches.  To undo a bad decision, you go back to the last good node and start a new branch from there.<p>- You can still move data between nodes.  For example, in a text editor I would be able to cut text in a discarded branch to incorporate it to my current one.<p>Does this make sense to you?<p>I don't understand the problems you mention with subversion, but aren't those implementation issues?  Or do you mean that these are inherent limitations in the undo concept?",1184686237

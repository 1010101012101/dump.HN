8960974,comment,8959207,8959347,0,0,yoz,,,"Here&#x27;s how the AI worked (second-hand, because although I was semi-involved with the game, I wasn&#x27;t on the dev team).<p>The original natural language parser was Velocitext, an engine we licensed from Virtus. I say &quot;original&quot; because our devs - mainly the super-smart Jason Williams - put a ton of tweaks and other new code into it, and Douglas ended up naming the new system &quot;Spookitalk&quot; (because it was spookily good).<p>Here&#x27;s how to make spookily good AI:<p>1. When ST came out (late 90s), everyone had basement-low expectations of natural language parsers. These days things are <i>somewhat</i> better with Siri and Wolfram and the like, but back then the best you had - especially in games - were the Infocom and Magnetic Scrolls adventure systems. It turns out that all you need to blow people away is something that&#x27;s <i>slightly</i> better than that; people expect computers to be useless at this stuff, so when they can occasionally come out with something smart, the impression is huge.<p>2. Jason and our test lead (Francine) put HUGE amounts of time in putting people in front of the game, recording text entered and the responses, then tweaking, iterating, etc. The AI&#x27;s job  was to parse text, add a little context and then return one of the several thousand pre-recorded responses. By the time the game came out, Jason had it handling the vast majority of things that people were actually likely to type.<p>But again, the secret: AI doesn&#x27;t have to be amazing. It just has to be better than you expect at doing the single thing it&#x27;s meant to do. (See also: Valve&#x27;s relatively simple soldier AI in the original Half-Life, which was amazing at the time)",1422464395

8960923,comment,8957385,8960777,0,0,Steuard,,,"Mind you, you might instead keep the <i>voltage</i> constant (rather than the charges), perhaps by keeping both plates plugged in to a battery the whole time. In that case, the story changes:<p>* Voltage is (morally) equal to electric field times distance, so here if the separation between the plates doubles then the electric field must be cut in half.<p>* The plates&#x27; area is fixed, so the volume between them is proportional to their separation.<p>* The same fact from before about energy density being proportional to electric field strength squared applies, and total energy is still energy density times the volume between the plates.<p>So combining these ideas, we can see that the total energy stored between the plates will wind up <i>decreasing</i> as the plates are pulled apart, because the decreasing field winds up being squared when finding the total energy.<p>That seems very strange! Opposite charges attract, after all, so you&#x27;d still expect that you would need to do work to pull the plates apart. The subtlety here is that the battery&#x27;s stored energy is changing in this process as well. (Let&#x27;s assume a rechargeable battery for the moment.) As the plates separate, the charge on each plate goes down in proportion to the reduced electric field in between, so there&#x27;s suddenly a lot of excess charge that needs to go somewhere. That means that the extra positive charges will be forced back into the battery&#x27;s + side and the extra negative charges will be forced back into its - side. And that process stores additional energy. I haven&#x27;t done the calculation, but I assume that this increase in energy will more than compensate for the decrease of energy in the capacitor itself (in exactly the right proportion to allow for the work of pulling the plates apart).",1422463875

It accurately and factually reports the difficulties one has to grapple with in order to use this exploit successfully. It paints a picture of this exploit as being limited in scope, limited in execution, and limited in use, all of which are true.<p>The sentence after the first one you quote explicitly explains this sentence, so it is not misleading.<p>The author never alludes to the idea that &quot;many apps are not at risk&quot; equals &quot;nothing to worry about&quot;. He links to an e-mail that describes a list of apps that are apparently not affected by the bug. In fact, the point at the beginning of the paragraph, &quot;not all applications are at equal risk&quot;, very fairly summarizes his point.<p>The third point about obsolete functions is a minor one, but again, accurate and useful in lowering the scope of potential attack targets.<p>Finally, we know how to exploit this. Qualys is even going to release a metasploit module. And the risk is small not because we don&#x27;t understand it, but because <i>the risk is small</i>, as has been pointed out many times in the article. It&#x27;s been figured out. It&#x27;s very simple, and it&#x27;s not very useful. This article explains that.<p>--<p>What the article doesn&#x27;t explicitly mention is the real silver bullet in the whole thing: you have to inject a DNS record into gethostbyname&#x27;s buffer that is an invalid record. It&#x27;s bigger than DNS records are allowed to be and uses invalid characters. So every DNS resolver and server in the world is going to ignore it. So the only way you can really exploit this reliably is by 1. hacking a DNS resolver used by a server, or 2. man-in-the-middle attacks.

The only terms on which it can be said to support free speech are the terms under which it is able to mine user data, then sell user data. In less polite terms, Facebook is a no-limits whore for anyone with cash, so we should expect to see exactly what we are seeing.<p>Here&#x27;s a question: what are the conditions under which Facebook will censor the content in the US/European market?

8960840,comment,8960445,8960445,0,0,yoha,,,"I feel like there is still a misunderstanding about why a part of researchers want to prepare fail-safes on AGI [1]. They are not arguing that AGIs <i>will</i> be a threat to human life, only that it <i>could</i>. One of the issues when projecting ourselves in situations we have never encountered is that we can never really know what will happen.<p>Terminator-like scenarios are easy to grasp since anthropomorphism allows us to think of Skynet as &quot;evil&quot;. However, people who argue that AGIs might be a danger are not considering this scenario in particular. Rather, they are considering that AGIs present a special threat when compared to other recent innovations. Some devices can blow up and injure, or even kill, a few humans; a weapon of massive destruction can directly affect millions of people. But still, the effects are easily limited to a geographical area and a segment in time (be it fifty years).<p>On the other hand, a strong AI <i>could</i> theoretically be able to maintain and improve itself without any definite bound. In such a scenario, AGIs would rather be like intelligent predators than dull physical processes. For the last thousands of years, we have managed to stay safe from potential animal predators most of the time. We have no idea if we could resist a new predator with the ability to use most of our technology. The persistent risk would then be for the strong AI to suddenly take decisions that would result in the bankruptcy of a company, the crash of planes or, why not, a Terminator-like scenario.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligenc...</a>",1422463180

Often there&#x27;s not even a mechanism for reporting other players globally. The lack of oversight allows a culture of trolling and nastiness to thrive.<p>Twitter could also do more to proactively prevent troll accounts and monitor tweets without waiting for someone to report it. I&#x27;d be a little more sympathetic to startup-stage Twitter figuring it out, but they&#x27;re to the point where I&#x27;d expect something better.<p>Those who raise the &quot;free speech&quot; argument fail to realize that these are private companies.

8960777,comment,8957385,8960048,0,0,Steuard,,,"Let&#x27;s set aside equations and think about this conceptually. To be clear about the question here, I&#x27;m assuming that you have put a fixed charge onto each plate (equal and opposite) and then isolated them (so the charges remain constant). Here are the key ideas that are significant for this:<p>* Assuming the separation between the plates is always small compared to their diameter/size, parallel plate capacitors give rise to a very simple electric field pattern: it is essentially zero everywhere outside, and it is uniform throughout the region between the plates with a strength that is <i>independent</i> of the separation. (Technically, it depends only on the area charge density: charge per unit area. All of this can be deduced from the electric field pattern of an infinite charged plane.)<p>* Capacitors store their energy within that electric field between the plates. All electric fields carry an energy density proportional to field strength squared, so the total energy stored in a uniform field is proportional to the volume occupied by that field.<p>So for your question, I can combine these ideas to recognize that pulling the plates apart will result in a larger volume between the plates, and therefore it must result in more stored energy (because the strength of the field in between stays the same as you pull). That energy has to come from somewhere, so I can deduce that I would have to put energy into the system while pulling: it would indeed be hard to pull apart. (The level of &quot;hard&quot; would depend on a lot of factors.)<p>(If you pull far enough so the separation isn&#x27;t small compared to the plates&#x27; diameter anymore, you&#x27;ll pretty quickly reach a case where you can approximate each plate as a point charge. Pulling those opposite charges apart clearly requires work, too, though the force gets smaller as they get farther apart.)",1422462562

Sales, marketing, product positioning, feedback gathering, and investor relations can all be separate jobs later, after you have enough money coming in to support that specialization. In an early stage startup, if you&#x27;re not building the product, you need to be the money person, so you should be doing all of that, and you need connections to do it well.<p>If you&#x27;re a non-technical co-founder, the primary value you bring to the business is the people you already know, who have money.

If you can&#x27;t <i>tell a story</i> about &quot;what&#x27;s really going on&quot; (qualitatively) without reference to the equations, then (in most cases) you probably shouldn&#x27;t try to use the equations, either. I see student after student try to solve complicated problems via &quot;equation hunting&quot;, where they just dig through their notes or the textbook looking for formulas that have the right variables in them, and then look for ways of combining them to find an answer. (Sometimes their thinking is a step more sophisticated than that, but it&#x27;s a characteristic pattern.)

[The podcast Invisibilia interviews Hart here.](http://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/377515477/fearless?showDate=2015-01-16)<p>TV shows like To Catch a Predator have impregnated the idea that danger lurks around every corner. Bullies use the internet to attack kids even when they&#x27;re at home.<p>Technology improves lives in countless ways. Can it be used to make people feel safer, particularly when it comes to their children?<p>Do devices like GPS Children Trackers, or internet monitoring actually make us feel safer, or do they just reinforce the worry that the world is a dangerous place?",1422461648

So instead of getting your candidates through recruiters, you put out job ads and get candidates.  This might improve your success rate in getting good candidates in for that first interview…<p>But after that?  If an employer is still doing fizz buzz, adding branches to binary trees, seeing if they can write an outer join, quizzing them about ruby syntax - the approach is still pretty bad.  Just not quite as bad as when they start with a recruiter.<p>My goal is to never do another technical interview again. The way I&#x27;m trying to do this is by expanding my contacts -  and I don&#x27;t mean exchanging business cards, I mean open source projects where I work technically with a large and wide spread group of people in a number of different organizations.  People think you need to be some &quot;rock star&quot; to do this, but really, you don&#x27;t.  Keep in mind, it doesn&#x27;t need to be the equivalent of being a major contributor to rails or the apache server.  They can be business apps with a smaller install base and maybe a dozen or so developers.  The key is, at any given moment, there are several dozen developers at perhaps 6-12 organizations that wouldn&#x27;t need to ask you about binary tree traversal because <i>they have already worked extensively with you</i>.  You&#x27;ve done presentations and code reviews, you&#x27;ve made contributions to the code base, you&#x27;ve fixed bugs.  If they had a question about certain tech issues, they&#x27;d probably call or email you.<p>Unfortunately, this still describes a relatively small number of jobs.  Most orgs aren&#x27;t willing to make their own code base open source (reducing hiring opportunities for developers), and almost by definition most people doing this already have jobs (reducing hiring opportunities for employers_s who want to get away from the unpleasantness of the hiring process.  Get involved in meaningful open source projects, and develop a good reputation for your work.  Blog about your technical breakthroughs.  See if you can speak at conferences.<p>I also would say that this isn&#x27;t at all easy, and that people with this sort of ability are likely to find other opportunities outside software development with better pay and greater career prospects.",1422461309

Fake both sides : This is a bit extreme but definitely a practice used. For ex, fake users asking questions and fake users answering on quora. This basically starts to create momentum validating it for new users.<p>3. Content : Content is a new way to solve this. This is something I have tried first hand. Create a blog on the same domain. Start creating content that explains your marketplace and starts to attract both sides of your marketplace. You can also strategize so that you start attracting the heavier side of users first( ex : buyer/seller case. If you have buyers you will end up having sellers soon).<p>One really important note is to see the cause and effect of your marketplace.

Explanations of concepts often draw on analogy, classical electrical theory, and quantum physics alike.  This multitude of approaches has helped me grasp the fundamentals more firmly than other books.  It also keeps an eye on practical applications.  Sections on, say, power rectifiers or op amps or timers or debouncing circuits or whatever all show you many variations on a theme, with discussion of what you would want to use in which situations.<p>Also, if I&#x27;m speaking to anyone else like me, software engineers who want to know hardware, buy all the books you can, but get an oscilloscope.

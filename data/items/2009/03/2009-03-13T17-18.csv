It looks very interesting, I just ran into trouble porting it to OpenBSD on amd64* and haven't gotten back to it. (I've done several ports for OpenBSD, and when/if I get it ported I will submit it.)<p>I prefer to work in languages that are reasonably portable across Linux, BSD (inc. OS X), and Windows. Combined with my other priorities and general taste, this means Lua, various Scheme implementations, OCaml, and C. (Your taste and priorities probably differ, though. Peace.)<p>* Which is an interesting portability test - Linux-isms are invalid, stuff that isn't 64-bit clean won't work, it's not quite i386, and OpenBSD's randomizing malloc tends to expose interesting bugs as well. (The only real loss has been Haskell, but I'm uneasy with how Haskell's de-facto standard seems to be ""whatever the newest GHC does"" when GHC has bootstrap/portability issues, e.g. <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/1346"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/1346</a> .)",1236965727

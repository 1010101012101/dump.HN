Google spent a lot of time working on the problem so they could obscure faces in Google Street View. You start by looking for the eyes, which are dark spots surrounded by white. Then, you go from the eyes to the nose.<p>Identifying <i>which</i> person a face belongs to is a classification problem, which gets difficult the larger the set you&#x27;re comparing to. Facebook has some tech that is interesting here, but it also only checks your friends and some level of false positives is acceptable. I imagine it that what algorithms they have aren&#x27;t quite good enough to, say, identify your face out of an entire city&#x27;s worth of driver&#x27;s license photos.

See for example, this video: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4DT3tQqgRM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4DT3tQqgRM</a>.

I work in the film trade, and while people may consider a logline or a one-sheet, when some reads a script they sit down and read it start to finish, like a book. It&#x27;s going to play in linear form on the screen, so it has to be read that way as well.<p>What authors usually do is is knock out a freeform treatment where the story is described in prose, which is then broken down into scenes. It is helpful to have the overview in mind during the writing process, but existing tools such as Final Draft provide a plethora of writing aids for that, from virtual index cards to graphical character timelines.<p>Bear in mind that when you work with finished scripts like the <i>Alien</i> example, you&#x27;ve got a survivor bias problem, because almost any story that makes it through the screen has been through multiple drafts and hundreds or thousands of mini-edits. So while it seems very natural to lay that out in a neat hierarchy, that doesn&#x27;t really reflect the writing environment, which is a lot more messy.<p>As for keeping track of story context, this is job one for the writer - you can beef up the dialog or whatever later, but writers, directors and other keys need to be able to keep the entire story in their head at once and know what the inputs and and outputs of any given scene are, not least because 99.9% of films are shot out of chronological sequence and so being able to keep a handle on that story context is essential for guiding the actors. Obviously you don&#x27;t try to remember every last little thing at once, that&#x27;s why we use storyboards and breakdown sheets, but you do need to be able to articulate the whole story off the cuff at the drop of a hat.<p>I do think this would very useful for film students doing analysis, but I can&#x27;t really see myself writing a script in it, although I&#x27;ll try doing some treatments with it.<p>BTW I also feel that if you offer people the opportunity to try it, you should let them try it, not switch to asking for a signup.

It would be great if authors could link directly to the part of a paper that they are citing and be able to open that up if you want to dive deeper. Linking methods to results to discussion for specific experiments would make reading through dense papers a lot easier, and maybe have a notation/jargon definition section open at the same time.

I didn&#x27;t like how Firebase is explicitly injected into and referred to in the controllers. I don&#x27;t want my controllers to be so tightly coupled to Firebase.<p>2. There was no support for associations. If you want to have object associations, which most non-trivial apps require, you need to manage all that complexity in your controllers using AngularFire. I wanted a solution that handled it implicitly, ala ActiveRecord.<p>3. I wanted additional features handled for me by the wrapper like timestamps, save/create/delete/init callbacks, collecting resources into stores to be used across controllers, etc.<p>4. AngularFire leans pretty heavily on Firebase as the place data is stored. I wanted to instead have my data stored in memory and automatically synced to Firebase without me having to worry about it. That way, if I ever switched away from Firebase I don&#x27;t need to change any of my controller code.<p>5. Pagination is something that becomes very important as you start to build more complex apps, and it&#x27;s not the most pleasant thing to deal with in Firebase at present. I wanted a wrapper that managed all those details for me.<p>Angular and Firebase are a great match, and AngularFire is a good way to get going quickly, but it lacks the features and depth required to make a truly complex application IMO.

In studies on ferrets scientists have discovered that the second auditory cortex, A2, tends to collect sonic motifsthings like a quickly rising pitch beginning near middle C, or any kind of warbling, or clear, constant tones at various pitches. Computationally, these motifs can be adapted to a particular corpus in order to improve detection and prediction rates while using a smaller bank of motifs. There&#x27;s also lots of investigation into how these motif banks can improve robustness to distortions and noise.<p>As far as I know, it remains speculation that this effect occurs in humans, but it seems by your experiences (and my own learning Mandarin as a second language) plausible that the human brain itself &quot;prunes&quot; less useful sonic motifs in early life improving your ability to rapidly understand your primary language(s) even under shifts in accent or other distortions. This would likely come at the cost of literal inability to be attentive to motifs that haven&#x27;t been stored. you would perceive them in A1, but they would have less resolution and perhaps semantic meaning (this is as far as I know quite wild speculation, mind).<p>I remember that it took almost an entire 6 mos of study before I really had a clue what tonality in Mandarin meantI could hear it, but never perceive it as a linguistic phenomenon. After 6 months it appeared to almost overnight become something sensible to me at which point I had to relearn almost my entire vocabulary including the tonal information that I&#x27;d been unknowingly ignoring.",1377883453

During the norming study for the test, someone thought to include foreigners at the Mandarin Training Center of the National Taiwan Normal University (  ) in the norming sample. My fellow students and I who were there at the time &quot;wrecked the curve&quot; for all the graduates of Chinese language programs at United States elite universities who had not spent significant time overseas.

In fact, I have a partnership with the DOD/NSA subcontractors who created it, and I have applied the technology to the automated creation of 3D Avatars given a single photo of a person&#x27;s face. My version of the tech is available at www.3D-Avatar-Store.com. The system works as follows: a person&#x27;s head is laser scanned, at the same time dozens of single photos are taken of that person from different angles, different lighting conditions, and different quality cameras. Then a neural net is trained to associate each photo with the laser scan data. After a few thousand trainings, anyone&#x27;s single photo would generate a reasonable likeness of them in 3D. Today, after over a decade of training and 10&#x27;s of thousands of scans added to the training database, we get remarkably good quality 3D reconstructions given a single photo of anyone, any age, any ethnicity. There are limitations, such as the face needs to be visible, and it needs to be within +/-30 degrees of facing the camera for the 3D reconstruction to be suitable for facial recognition. And that is the point of the original application of this technology: a facial recognition pre-processor. It corrects the face angle and removes any facial expression, creating a likeness of the face in a passport style photo perfect for facial recognition. But, of course, I&#x27;m not using it for that. I use it to auto-magically create 3D avatars for video game studios.<p>Oh, it&#x27;s really, really fast. My current system is based upon two generations back of neural nets, and they reconstruct from one photo in 0.9 seconds. The latest generation does 144 reconstructions simultaneously given HD video feeds.",1377883366

Some background: Right now my commute is about 35 minutes through Southern California (I live in Riverside and drive south to the Inland Empire).  On Tuesday, my car was totaled.  I was in the middle lane on a 3 lane highway when I saw someone coming up behind me a couple of miles before my exit, so I got over to the slow lane.  Right as the car behind me was passing me in the middle lane, their tire exploded, spinning them into me, and spinning me across the freeway into the center divider.<p>This crash is an example of just how much money not having money costs.  It wasn&#x27;t an issue of the driver&#x27;s unsafe driving, but of the driver&#x27;s unsafe vehicle due to poor maintenance.  Well, that driver doesn&#x27;t even have insurance, let alone money to fix their balding tires.  For now I&#x27;d agree with anyone that says it&#x27;s their fault for driving it, because that&#x27;s my insurance&#x27;s stance and that&#x27;s the stance that gets me reimbursed for my vehicle, but I can&#x27;t help but see how if they wanted to fix the initial problem of poor maintenance and no insurance, then they&#x27;d need money, so they&#x27;d need to drive to work...<p>But it gets worse.  My car handled the crash like a new car should.  I was safe. I got a little whiplash but I felt fine and was back to work that day.  Her car, much older than mine, flipped (exploding tires are about as bad as a car accident can get - keep up on your treads and watch the air pressure in the summer folks!) and she left the scene unconscious in an ambulance.  Now I don&#x27;t know what the statistics are, but my bet is if you don&#x27;t have car insurance, you&#x27;re note likely to have medical either.  So this woman, who started too broke to replace her tires, now has whatever legal trouble one gets for not having insurance, has no drivable vehicle, huge medical bills, and whatever suit my insurance files against her.<p>Me, I&#x27;m fine, but I&#x27;m without a car (and I opted out of the rental car coverage, and she has no insurance to reimburse me for one), so in the name of frugality I start taking the bus.  I go against traffic on my daily drive, so there aren&#x27;t many routes, but there is one.  It makes 93 stops between Downtown Riverside and my place of work.  It takes about 2 hours 15 minutes with walking time.  That&#x27;s over an hour and a half longer than my commute driving.  I&#x27;m on the bus with a few other people who make the same trip.  Right now my life consists of waking up, walking to the bus, sitting on the bus, going to work, walking back to the bus, taking it home, walking home, eating a small meal, and going to bed to repeat the process tomorrow.  Not to mention last night the bus was 2 hours late because of flash floods in Riverside.  I got home after my bed time.  Everyone this morning was taxed by pretty much all definitions of the word.

I have a fairly &quot;neutralized&quot; accent according to my native speaker friends. How did I get there ? Over 16 years of practice by listening to music, watching movies and most importantly, how my co-workers/colleagues communicate and express themselves. I still do that today when I can. Just a habit.<p>I am not interested in commenting whether PG should have said what he said or not but I do think that if you have a thick accent, you need to work on it and not just assume that people understand what you are saying even if your grammar is great.<p>My advice as a non native speaker.<p>-Talk slow. Lot of foreign languages are spoken fastly and hence when they switch to english, they go at the same pace. Don&#x27;t do that. Try and space out the words.<p>- Ensure that the each word is spoken clearly and not mixed together. Instead of saying &quot;how&#x27;r you&quot;, start with &quot;How are you&quot; ? Once you get a hang of it, you can switch to the faster version.<p>- Just working on specific letters can make a lot of difference. For example, the letter &#x27;T&#x27;. In Indian languages, people hit that letter really hard. So when they pronounce something like &quot;want&quot;, it sounds like &quot;wantttt&quot;. The tongue rolling should be minimal here.<p>- Watch english shows, movies, listen to music, radio whatever. Dont just stick to your own language. Socialize with people who don&#x27;t speak your native language. Observe them and learn.<p>- Most importantly, understand that just being able to speak english with perfect grammar is not enough. You need to do more. Nothing wrong with admitting this fact and working on it. Just my 2 cents.",1377882714

I made a wiki page, with the scanned content for every single monster that showed up.  I made wiki pages for every spell (with the scanned content of every spell, right there.)  I didn&#x27;t have to settle for the OGL content, I had the ACTUAL CONTENT FROM THE BOOKS, so my rule-lawyering players couldn&#x27;t complain that the DM&#x27;s rules were slightly different from their rules.  I made hot-clickable maps, to take me to rooms.  I made spreadsheets with every NPC, and their Initiatives, and Hit Points, and any effects on them...<p>...and now that I&#x27;ve made this thing, for personal use, it would be ILLEGAL for me to share this with anyone.<p>That sucks.<p>I&#x27;ve also played around with making computer role playing games, based off of some fantasy role playing game, but most of the &quot;FREE&quot; ones out there, are not available for commercial use, or I&#x27;d have to pay a licensing fee.<p>That sucks.<p>Ah well, I&#x27;m done rambling for now...<p>One more quick point: I don&#x27;t begrudge people for making copyrighted, commercial art like games and campaigns.

The latest fad is to sprinkle little amounts of money around and hope they can pluck a promising seedling.<p>The important point is that there are VCs out there willing to write little 5 and 6 figure checks, for the hope of a real deal in the future.  That has attracted professional deal makers, and this career looks especially attractive to people with weak technical chops for this industry but fancy they can make up for it with schmoozing.<p>Deal makers have a chicken and egg problem.  They cannot get non-small checks without eggs in the basket.  They cannot show any person with real money the eggs in the basket without promising future non-small checks to the future chicks.  And sometimes people with money decide to not write the big checks until they see pretty chicks.  Oops.<p>You were an egg.  The deal maker here cajoled you to rolled into their basket with small amounts of money.  And you were never given enough money to crack out of your shell.<p>I would point out that the deal maker is not screwing you over on purpose.  But they may be telling you <i>wildly</i> overoptimistic things, while they are scrambling to see if any of a dozen different people will write a real check.  When they refuse to explain, it is because they do not want to own up to making promises which they were not sure they could deliver.<p>As for Los Angeles, I may not have the best ear to the ground, but it does not sound like a top 5 location for recruiting tech talent.

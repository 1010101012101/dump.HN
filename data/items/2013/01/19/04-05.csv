When I heard this, it sounded ridiculous, since sleep is so important for the body.<p>A theory I have been developing is that perhaps meditation that achieves a no-mind state for a long period of time, may allow the practitioner's brain and body to enter the same kind of restorative repair cycle that it normally only enters during unconscious sleep (the only time a normal person's mind is truly shut-off).<p>A variety of experiences have lead me to suspect this, most profoundly being the night AFTER my 10 day retreat ended, when I was quite tired from a long day, having stayed up past midnight, despite having gotten up at 4:30 am that day for the final day of the retreat.<p>When I lay down to sleep, exhausted, I fell into a deep meditative state.  I got up and opened my eyes, took a walk around the block, went back to try and sleep, and immediately was back in a meditative state.  Gave up and just went along with experiencing being in that state all night, since I was totally aware, yet in the morning felt very rested despite having not slept a wink.",1358570831

It should have been. I wrote that part, and I've played THHGTTG, but there was no causal relationship between these two events.

I agree that the Windows Phone 8 OS is quite nice. My problems were as follows:<p>* the volume wasn't loud enough - I kept missing calls even when the volume was on 30/30. This is just not acceptable and I wasn't going to spend 2 years explaining to my wife why I didn't answer her call. Also, I hate the fact that there was no media volume. If I wanted to watch youtube or listen to Nokia Music the volume that the ringer was at is what the youtube/music was at.<p>* MMS didn't work. I couldn't send MMS when connected to wifi. I had to go through 4 steps to get it to work. I'm sorry but a brand new phone shouldn't have this issue. That is something that should have been tested and others have had the same issue.<p>* Call waiting didn't work - I was on the phone with my mom and my wife called. I heard the typical call waiting beep and looked at my screen. There was no notification of an incoming call, which I thought was weird but I just kept on talking with my mom. After I was done talking to her I was going to call my wife to see if she tried calling me, except I couldn't. The call with my mom never ended, it was stuck ""ending call"". I would click on the ""People"" tile to call my wife and it would bring me to my stuck ending call. I had to restart the phone and when I did it showed I missed 5 of my wife's calls.<p>* The OS feels like the Windows 95 of phones - while I liked most of the operating system, it just didn't seem stable. Too many times I had to restart the phone to fix a problem. One of those problems was the call waiting issue I mentioned above. Another was my data just stopped working, even though I had full bars and LTE. A phone shouldn't haven't to be restarted to get things to work, at least in my opinion.<p>* Voicemail - the voicemail was confusing and there weren't any notifications. I went a week without knowing I had a voicemail. The only reason I found out was because my brother had told me via email he left a voicemail. The voicemail app on the live tiles wasn't for the voicemail, it was for visual voicemail, which isn't free.<p>Those were my main issues. The fact that I had so many issues in the first 20 days was what made me realize that I had to return it and couldn't spend 2 years with that phone.

Besides dissolving bad memories Vipassana also has an effect on the depth of your consciousness. Compare this with the upgrading of computer screens from 800 x 600 to the 1920 x 1200 resolution sported by many of them today. Everything is more detailed, more vivid. So is the effect of Vipassana: emotions are more ""real"" and makes the feeling of being alive more vibrant.  We see kids and pets being this way and that is why we like them, the are always fresh and enthusiastic, they know how to enjoy every second with nothing pulling them pack (an effect of not having those negative memories weighing on their brain). It is a profound change in the most intimate place of our being - the consciousness.<p>Then there is also an expansion, a feeling of infinity, eternity and something that could hardly be described by ""radiant space like consciousness"" or ""luminous mind"" which is really what meditators are after. This experience is the enlightenment sought by all religions and spiritual paths. You doubt it's existence? Just remember what your brain and body can do: bliss (orgasm), body buzz (marijuana high), extremely intense feelings of love (young people in love have this sometimes), total serenity (right after we when we wake up, before we start thinking about stuff), dissolution of the ego (we can all have this if we simply participate in a large gathering of people in an emotional state, like, a protest or a football match). Imagine an experience of which bliss, serenity, buzz, inner light are just aspects.<p>We do have the hardware for enlightenment, we just don't know the API. Vipassana is such an API.",1358569509

They won't always be nice, but if they're designed with the constraints of 3D printing in mind, they can be significantly better than just a generic part without any care in mind for the characteristics of 3D printing.<p>> Most plastics were too brittle and would crack when you snapped them on the iPhone. In fact, only 1 ABS was usable.<p>I haven't injection molded anything yet, but I have made some 3D objects with my home made fused deposition printer. This may not hold for other types of printers, but selecting the correct infill orientation, fill percentage, and pattern can drastically change the properties of the final printed part.<p>> The consumer models had a hard time with the curved surfaces and felt much grainier in the hand.<p>I'm not sure what kind of printer you have, but if it's correctly calibrated you can print some pretty nice curved surfaces. They'll always feel grainier because the ""normal"" direction is on the Z axis. With something like injection molding, as you get 'flat' faces everywhere as you have normal surfaces on every part of your mold. SLA does a little better with the layer heights, but the plastic isn't as strong.<p>> 3D printers are great for prototyping and hobbyists doing 1-offs. But the tech has a way to go before being useful to the average consumer.<p>That's absolutely what they're for. What if every piece of tech you had came with a CAD drawing that you could load up and make that thing you wanted but can't buy yet? What if you just wanted one, but someone wanted to buy them from you, and would be willing to skip the design step completely by letting you design it, and them buying it from you. Freelance engineering is getting a little closer (instead of having a full blown design studio, you can make the parts you need for a project in the comfort of your home no matter how bizarre they need to be). Nokia isn't trying to get anyone to mass produce cases with their designs (although they could be used that way), they're trying to entice people with access to a 3d printer and their phone to make something cool. Just check out the search for 'iphone' on thingiverse [1]. People are making anything and everything for them that enhances the functionality of the phone. Nokia wants in.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=iphone&sa="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=iphone&sa=</a>",1358569438

5082609,comment,5080210,5082510,10,0,haberman,,,"> Let's be honest: C is no ""closer to the metal"" than other high level languages<p>This is dead wrong, and your links do not support it.  This is exactly the kind of statement that gets me grumpy.<p>Your link illustrates that an aggressive C optimizer can collapse a chunk of C code down to something smaller and simpler than the original code.  This is true.<p>But what you said is that C is ""no closer to the metal"" than other high-level languages.  Let's examine this assumption.<p>Take this C function:<p><pre><code>  int plus2(int x) { return x + 2; }\n</code></pre>\nYou can compile this down into the following machine code on x86-64, which fully implements the function for all possible inputs and needs no supporting runtime of any kind:<p><pre><code>  lea    eax,[rdi+0x2]\n  ret\n</code></pre>\nNow take the equivalent function in Python:<p><pre><code>  def plus2(x):\n    return x + 2\n</code></pre>\nIn CPython this compiles down to the following byte code:<p><pre><code>  3           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)\n              3 LOAD_CONST               1 (2)\n              6 BINARY_ADD          \n              7 RETURN_VALUE\n</code></pre>\nNotice this is byte code and not machine code.  Now suppose we wanted to compile this into machine code, could we get something out of it that looks like the assembly from our C function above?  After all, you are claiming that C is ""no closer to the metal"" than other languages, so surely this must be possible?<p>The tricky part here is that BINARY_ADD opcode.  BINARY_ADD has to handle the case where ""x"" is an object that implements an overloaded operator __add__().  And if it does, what then?  Surely just a very few instructions of machine code will handle this case, if C is ""no closer to the metal"" than Python?<p>Well __add__() can be arbitrary Python code, so the only way you can implement this BINARY_ADD opcode is to implement an <i>entire Python interpreter</i> that runs __add__() in the overloaded operator case.  And the Python interpreter is tens of thousands of lines of code in... C.<p>The end result is that writing the same function in C and Python is the difference between two machine code instructions and implementing an entire interpreter.<p>This is why I get grumpy when people deny that C is any different than other high-level languages.  While this is a somewhat extreme case, you could make a similar argument about most operations that happen in other high-level languages; similar constructs will very frequently have less inherent cost in C.",1358568870

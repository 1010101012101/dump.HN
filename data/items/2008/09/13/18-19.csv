303265,comment,303017,303161,0,0,emmett,,,"It seems like you're making the argument that any company that turns a profit must by definition be creating value. But it's possible to turn a profit by all kinds of destructive means (fraud, externalized costs, etc.)<p>In particular in this case, the issue is not that the ads had 0 value themselves. Obviously, as you point out, his sites had some value. However, that value is clearly less than that of actually relevant search results (or so Google, the worlds foremost authority on search results, believes). Therefore the profit comes from externalizing the costs, rather than from value creation.",1221331991

Your comment contains the sort of conflict I'm talking about.<p>Why do you think it's acceptable not to? How is it that it is OK to do some things that displease the gods of protected content creation, yet still necessary to pay them certain forms of tribute? Why should people dance to the beat of a notion that is so obviously impractical? Should a couple of very specific business models be protected from natural progression of the digital revolution? Why should the onus be placed consumers to purchase things we clearly don't need to, and not on producers to create business models that actually make sense (e.g. steam, dongles, iphone store, support contracts, server-centric software)? What is it about your ethic that makes it something other than completely arbitrary?",1221331918

303257,comment,302934,302996,0,0,tptacek,,,"I don't like this paper. It makes a facile argument (""DRM systems will leak""), and then supports it with inaccuracies. For instance, the notion that watermarking is unlikely to succeed owing to technical challenges with the ""embedding layer"" --- huh? This irritates me on general principles! Watermarks are covert channels, something most security disciplines try to <i>eliminate</i>, and generally concede to be unstoppable.<p>What I think really happened here? This paper came out roughly a year after Ed Felten busted the SDMI watermark, and simply took his results and generalized them. Of course, SDMI is a crappy watermark; Ed Felten broke it in a matter of weeks.",1221331490

Some examples: User Interface, Graphics and Media, Developer Tools, Frameworks.<p>These evangelists have often helped developers shed more light on bugs against Mac OS X which are blocking the shipping of apps.  Also, they're often a great first-line contact at Apple for getting help from Apple's engineers outside of WWDC.<p>To get an additional App Store contact that could field developers' questions about apps that have been rejected with little or no explanation would be nice.<p>The small group of evangelists Apple already has on the payroll is spread quite thinly between their Mac OS X, and now iPhone, responsibilities as it is.<p>I suspect developers are already talking their ears off about App Store issues, and I bet Fraser's wish could likely come true eventually.  Whether it's in the form of a separate App Store evangelist, or a new iPhone-specific team of evangelists that can also help with shedding light on the App Store process, it'd be a huge improvement.",1221330902

Your job as an entrepreneur is to work around the obstacles.  Give Apple an app that they can't afford to reject.

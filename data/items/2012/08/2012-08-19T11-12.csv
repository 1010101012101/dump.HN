They create artificial barriers to entry so that, when people get in, they spend loads of money ""on the experience"" because they feel lucky and perhaps a bit superstitious. It works for a few months and makes an enormous amount of money.<p>Two years later, some other club is hot and that one is a non-concern, full of ""B&T"" (bridge and tunnel, i.e. non-New Yorkers) and college kids on spring break. There's actually a lot of truth in the Yogi Berra quote: ""That place is so crowded, no one goes there anymore."" Once ""the crowd"" can get in, no one important wants to be there, and the $10,000-per-night people have moved on. A nightclubs has a lifespan. The owners and promoters put it into maintenance mode and start another one. This works extremely well for that industry. If you can sell a $30 bottle of vodka for $700, you've figured something out. Having to start a new club every 18 months isn't a major burden for the owners and promoters. It's the Hollywood model of starting a new project every year.<p>This works poorly for the airlines, which have infrastructural needs that require them to focus on the long term. The airlines play similar status games. There's economy which is deliberately uncomfortable, and first/business (first in domestic flight, business) which ought to be 1.5x the price (50% more space) but is between 1x and 5x depending on a bunch of weird variables, some of which are deliberately indexed to the person's socioeconomic status. You never get a good sense of what a ticket ""should"" cost because they deliberately keep it vague.<p>In the long run, this leads to abandon. Truly high-status people don't use commercial airlines anymore, not even international first. The rest will fly commercial but hate the experience, and would probably ditch the planes in a second if we had decent (250+ mph, 5-8 cents per mile) train service like they have in Europe. Morale in the industry is at an all-time low. As soon as credible alternatives to the mainline commercial airlines exist, they're done for.",1345377564

You see what the rest of the world has, and want to take part.  Want to work on building a Boeing 777?  You can't do it in New Zealand.  Sure, you can work at small companies building small planes, but if you want to be working ""world scale"", you have to be where all the people are.<p>To relate back to HN, there are a few small startups, but the market is different in New Zealand.  As a nation of small businesses, about 95% of the population work for a company with 50 or fewer staff. If your business involves selling to other businesses at scale, there are comparatively far fewer opportunities to do this.<p>NZ would be a great place to put a remote team (Mozilla have one in Auckland) and Kiwis love the idea a company will pay to fly them around the world every now and then.

Learn basics of accounting (or coding for that matter), it is not that difficult.<p>2. Have a good expert in your team and rely on his/her judgement.<p>3. Listen to 3 experts talk and form your own opinion.<p>Going back to the crowdfunding example, the actual decisions and actions will depend on the start-up's specific situation.<p>When we speak about R&D, for example development of new software or hardware, in most of the cases it is possible to capitalize R&D expenses and defer those expenses hitting P&L. BUT this will actually increase corporate profit tax in the current and following 1-2 years. And this will increase cash outlay now because due taxes are indeed need to be paid.<p>On the other hand if the start-up [meaning legal entity] is not profitable, it is possible to defer profit tax using carry forward provisions [which have specific limitations re amounts/timeframe/eligibility].<p>So, yes, learn basics, but speak with expert... :-)",1345377097

4403788,comment,4401174,4401723,1,0,pmjordan,,,"64-bit integers don't really solve the bugs, they just make them slightly less probable. They basically don't help against malicious input in the general case.<p>The most famous example for this kind of bug is probably the binary search implementation in Java:<p><a href=""http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-...</a><p>The interesting thing about this bug and many like it, is that you don't need <i>real</i> arbitrary-precision arithmetic to avoid it. The result of the expression (a + b) / 2 can be proven to safely fit into 32 bits if a and b are known to fit into 32 bits as well - the compiler just needs to make the result of the intermediate expression (a + b) be stored 33 bits, or to transform the it into a mathematically equivalent expression that has the same properties as the original expression with a 33-bit intermediate.<p>Of course, this only can be applied to a subset of algorithms - I suspect this quickly devolves into the halting problem in general. But maybe new languages could specify that such halting problem cases need to be manually determined (explicitly choose between arbitrary precision arithmetic and truncation). The simpler cases can be deduced automatically. I guess that means in addition to uint32_t and uint64_t we'll probably need more specific types, such as ""positive (nonzero) integer in the range 1 to 1 << 32"". Which would be tedious if you had to specify it explicitly all the time, so you'd need good inference and solid support for generic functions.",1345376317

Additionally any article you'd get there will oversimplify to the point of mostly offering an admonishment to check with an accountant.<p>As a business typically you are going to pay for net income.  Calculating net income is going to be difficult in this case because it depends on what you are raising money to do.<p>Raising $500k to pay some experts to go develop the world's best pizza recipe in a year?  Do this the same year as the fundraising?  If you can spend all of the money you raise on bona fide business expenses (but see amortization below!) then it isn't going to raise your tax liability at all.<p>Similarly suppose it is for a pizza oven.  Now we get into the complications.  Do the tax laws (we are talking tax accounting not GAAP or financial accounting here) allow you to take the whole thing off the first year?  or are you required to amortize the cost at a specific schedule?  Irrespective of the ability to do so, would you prefer to amortize over a specific schedule with the idea that you save up for a replacement?

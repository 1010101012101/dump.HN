Throwing three sixes in a row wit a die isn&#x27;t evidence that a die is loaded, but doing that 10 times out of 20 attempts? Highly suspicious.<p>Of course, with a die, we can weigh it, find its center of gravity, cut it poem, etc. that makes it easier to &#x27;prove&#x27; what&#x27;s the cause of our extraordinary luck.<p>Bu suppose we find that the die contains some mechanism that allows one to change its center of gravity. Then, we cannot be sure that all those &#x27;3 sixes in a row&#x27; throws were caused by a change in the center of gravity.<p>Here, the case is more difficult, because we cannot cut open the object of study.",1398067124

7620218,comment,7619824,7619824,2,0,mozey,,,"I use jQuery to speed up specific Angular controllers with lots of binding. The jQuery allows me to avoid the bindings on things like lists entirely. I create a companion directive to my controller with isolate scope. The two then communicate via events. Or the directive just calls the controllers functions from the child scope. Inside the directive I can render the list using something like Mustache, Handlebars, PureJS, etc. All of them seem to be faster than Angular by a factor of 10. Using the jQuery I can then bind, for example, one click handler to the entire list.<p>I load jQuery after Angular. This means Angular is still using jqLite - and prevents the extra functionality from being abused in simpler use-cases.<p>Sometime in the future browsers will support Object.observe natively. At this point I will scrap my companion directives and use Angular binding even in long lists.",1398067029

You want a good performance baseline and the ability of quickly write correct code. For many Scala and the JVM is a better tradeoff than C or C++ in this regard. See Martin Thompson&#x27;s blog if you want to know more about low-level performance optimisation on the JVM.<p>You&#x27;re also overlooking the benefit of a modern type system. If you haven&#x27;t used one before it&#x27;s difficult to appreciate what they bring. Twitter&#x27;s Summingbird project is a great example of how a few powerful abstractions, enabled by Scala&#x27;s type system, can simplify a very complex problem.<p>What I like about Scala and the JVM is they have a large expressive width (<a href=""http://noelwelsh.com/programming/2013/07/10/expressive-width/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://noelwelsh.com/programming/2013/07/10/expressive-width...</a>).

So writing down culture is a rather weird exercise, though i suppose it works as a corrective mechanism. But this memo feels like a half measure. If you want to preserve your culture, best way is to keep following it and lead by example, and you employees will keep following it, and the new ones will automatically conform to it.

You see it clearly in Stalins later statement:<p>&quot;You, Mr Wells, evidently start out with the assumption that all men are good. I, however, do not forget that there are many wicked men. I do not believe in the goodness of the bourgeoisie.&quot;<p>Where Marx saw capitalists (and workers) as forced by circumstance into playing an inevitable role in society - neither inherently good or bad -, Stalin saw capitalists as &quot;wicked men&quot;.<p>In general, a lot of the worst flaws of the Bolsheviks boils down to the near unwavering belief that they were on the side of good in a battle between good and evil, and an idea of a &quot;working class&quot; that they fetishised as near super-human.<p>While Marx would agitate against specific people, he would not categorise groups of people in moral terms. He attacked ideas and behaviour, and expected people would change with circumstance: The capitalist behaves like a capitalist because that is what he needs to do to protect his own interests, and if he don&#x27;t act as a capitalist, he won&#x27;t remain one - he will eventually face financial ruin and become part of the working class, where he will act as a worker.<p>In fact, in part I of the Communist Manifesto, Marx and Engels wrote:<p>&quot;Altogether collisions between the classes of the old society further, in many ways, the course of development of the proletariat. The bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant battle. At first with the aristocracy; later on, with those portions of the bourgeoisie itself, whose interests have become antagonistic to the progress of industry; at all time with the bourgeoisie of foreign countries. In all these battles, it sees itself compelled to appeal to the proletariat, to ask for help, and thus, to drag it into the political arena. The bourgeoisie itself, therefore, supplies the proletariat with its own elements of political and general education, in other words, it furnishes the proletariat with weapons for fighting the bourgeoisie.<p>Further, as we have already seen, entire sections of the ruling class are, by the advance of industry, precipitated into the proletariat, or are at least threatened in their conditions of existence. These also supply the proletariat with fresh elements of enlightenment and progress.&quot;<p>This treatment of a persons class as a matter of circumstance was <i>essential</i> to Marx: Large parts of Marxist theory was based on the foundation that politics in the large is defined by people acting broadly in their self-interest, moderated by their understanding of that interest (e.g. the extent to which a class &quot;buys&quot; the justifications the ruling class gives; consider for example Marx&#x27; Critique of the Gotha program, where he points out that the proposed program is meaningless when it writes about &quot;fairness&quot; in part because the current system of distribution is &quot;fair&quot; according to bourgeois standards - without being explicit, the word says nothing)<p>But the world becomes so much easier to deal with when one can write off ones opponents as &quot;wicked men&quot;.",1398065465

While most of the ideas currently on the forefront of software engineering were invented decades ago, many of them have only hit mainstream very recently. While pure functional programming isn&#x27;t used very often on large projects, current best practices prefer a declarative functional style whenever possible.<p>While a &quot;for&quot; loop may not have changed, someone who has only coded C++ may not understand why it&#x27;s often the wrong way to iterate over a collection in modern environments. They might not understand why you&#x27;d use function parameters instead of inheritance, or lots of tiny single-method classes instead of one class that handles every aspect of a data type.<p>While these may seem like simple implementation details, they can lead to different approaches to problem solving, and conflicts over programming style that you might need to mediate. For example, if one of your group&#x27;s goals is test coverage, then it would be helpful to have done some TDD, and know what characteristics are more or less conducive to testing.<p>While none of these ideas is brand new, there are a lot of teams that have only recently started embracing them, and a manager who hasn&#x27;t kept up is probably not going to be a very good fit on a team that has.",1398063647

The standard of living they enjoy is fantastically better than the poor or even middle class in any developing nation.  Not only that, but their standard of living is far superior to the standard of living of the &quot;poor&quot; in this country 10, 20, or 50 years ago.  Economic growth has lifted all boats.  What&#x27;s more, no one in this nation has a valid justification for envy.<p>If your neighbors are eating well while your children are starving, okay, be envious.  It might be justified.  That&#x27;s not the case here.  As Maggie Thatcher once responded to an accuser, &quot;you would prefer that the poor be poorer, in order that the rich would be less rich&quot;.

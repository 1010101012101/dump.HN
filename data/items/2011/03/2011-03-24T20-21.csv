Instead, it retrieves all of the people that you follow on twitter and lists any of them that also have identi.ca accounts on your screen.<p>If you were thinking about dropping twitter entirely, this could help you make a more informed decision before you switch: do you really want to switch when only 10% of your friends on twitter actually have identi.ca accounts?  Or on the opposite end, if you prefer identi.ca and see that 90% of your friends also have identi.ca accounts, then go ahead and subscribe to those users and jump ship.<p>The app doesn't do anything magical; it simply gives you information.

2365924,comment,2364065,2365752,0,0,cube13,,,"Not really.  The line is this:
long adv = min(recwin, (long)TCP_MAXWIN << tp->rcv_scale) - (tp->rcv_adv - tp->rcv_nxt);<p>So it's really:
long = uint(long, (long)uint32) - (uint32-uint32)<p>Here's the problem on x64: you're converting a 64-bit long to a uint, then doing a subtraction with another uint, then placing that result into a 64-bit long.  Since the compiler is just doing an assignment rather than a sign extension, which is why there is a large positive number rather than -1.<p>Changing it to use the lmin macro would make it:
long = long(long, (long)uint32) - (uint32-uint32)<p>This still has the underlying issue(using 32-bit values in 64-bit buckets), which should work out fine, but may have issues down the road.<p>It makes more sense to change all the long types to int32/uint32 types rather than just cast longs everywhere.  If recwin and adv were changed to int32, it would be:
int32 = uint32(int32, uint32) - (uint32 - uint32)<p>While this potentially has issues if the uints are between 0x80000000 and 0xfffffff, it's a safer solution than using longs.<p>EDIT: added some explanation",1301000264

If people make fun games in 6 months, I'd expect DNF to have a lot more. I still play Genesis games, so graphical flash isn't something I put much value on, usually, but after such a long development time, I'd expect DNF to be at least on-par with the current generation of high end game AS WELL AS being fun and addictive, having replayability, great storyline, physics, AI, dialogue whatever.<p>So (IMO) my point stands: no matter how great DNF really is, it will never live up to the expectations built up by 1) previous DN games, 2) marketing and hype, 3) the 14 years of development and 4) the amount of money 3D Realms and Gearbox Software put into it.

I guess I fail at subtle mockery.<p>Credit should be given where credit is due. Apple's Smart Cover was an innovation. Miniot's cover is less of an innovation, but no less smart from a business sense, and it would have been impossible for them to make this product for any other tablet, because it's too soon for Samsung <i>et al</i> to have added magnets to their tablets.

Or are you saying ""Yes, they inspire great design, but here's this other <i>completely unrelated</i> gripe I have, so I'm going to grind my axe every time Apple is mentioned with any kind of positive tone?""<p>I'm not slamming you on this, if you could show a connection between the two things, that would be very interesting. Sticking to software and not to hardware, I might say that Microsoft and the PC manufacturers allow anybody to make anything, so there are nice PC-Windows things but they are drowned in a sea of dreck. But Apple retain a tight fist over software and filter out the crap. It might appear that Apple inspires great software, but that's only because the proportion of nice stuff to dreck is higher when someone's filtering the dreck out. In reality there might be 2x or even 10x as much nice stuff in total written for Windows, it's just drowned by 100x as much dreck.<p>Now, I am not saying that, it's a strawman put up as an example of drawing a connection between their closed platform policies and great design by third parties.

For entrepreneurs, who have little to lose and a lot to gain, most risk-taking is good. For established companies, which have a lot to lose and a lot to gain, it's much more of a balancing act.<p>There are a lot of risks that have a moderately large upside and a huge potential downside, that tends to be delayed, that a lot of CEOs are given a lot of incentives to take. Mark Hurd with HP comes to mind: it's pretty risky to cut payrolls, gut R&D budgets, and focus mainly on really high-margin products like overpriced ink. The upside is a big bump in profits, but the downside risk is making your employees hate the company and getting killed when someone else starts selling slightly less overpriced ink. The downside tends to be delayed a bit, though, so CEOs who make $25m and get a golden parachute don't need to worry about it.",1300999412

The issue with this argument is Ebay, Akamai etc were the Zynga, Twitter and Groupon's of their day. They are now businesses with 10 years of trading history and relative flat revenues. For example Ebay's current revenue annual growth is just 5% and Akamai's 6%. It's hardly surprising that their multiples are low now (for comparison eBay grew 100% year on year back in 2000)<p>If he put Twitter, Facebook, Zynga and Groupon in that table then I think the numbers of today would be as bad as the numbers of 2000.  e.g. Facebook and Groupon is at roughly 25 EV/Revenue (where Cisco and Amazon were in 2000) and Twitter is prob more like 100 (comparable to ebay).  The PE ratios (for those that make profit in this group) would be even more stark.<p>Obviously the companies I've listed are still private, but that is more a factor of the IPO markets, and companies choosing to delay an IPO where as in 2000 a company like Facebook or Twitter would have IPO'd by now.",1300998121

That's how I discovered the scene of musical festivals(in Europe). Travelling there for the first time(and travelling abroad for first time in general) was so amazing(the vibe, meeting new people, making friendships), that upon returning back home at 5am, after a week at said festival, the first thing me and my gf did was looking up for flight tickets for another festival we read about in some flyer :)<p>Ever since then I began quitting my job every summer and travel for at least a month to festivals all over Europe. Needless to say I meet many remarkable people (and with most we also shared common passion about music), which lead to great friendships I hope to cherish for the rest of my life.<p>B) So like it's already been mentioned in the thread, look for things you'd like to do, or figure doing what could make you happy.

Anti-aging treatments will start out expensive but be very cheap within a generation: a $2 pill every month. Technology's pace of change is accelerating, not diminishing.<p>Aging and dying costs the medical system about $500,000 per person. Then there is the loss of that person's productive potential. Anti-aging treatments are going to be incredibly cheap in comparison to death.<p>Post-aging population growth is likely to be closer to linear than exponential. Would you really want to deal with 5000 kids for a million years?<p>There will be a lot of problems with post-aging humanity, but they aren't the ones people propose, especially not the ecological ones. Humanity's ecological load on the planet will max out some time early this millennium. As a cautious transhumanist and a deistic Buddhist, I worry about spiritual emptiness. I think post-aging, post-scarcity might look like the realm of the <i>devas</i> and <i>ashuras</i> in Buddhism (often mistranslated as ""gods"" and ""demigods"") which may exist only as metaphor now, but is likely to become reality (for some) in a few hundred years. I see no need and no way to prevent these changes (end of aging and death) and we have no right to do so, but they do run the risk of allowing people to lock themselves into sub-optimal and stagnant states. Also, I may be wrong about the post-aging world and I hope I am. A world with a 50,000-year lifespan may be a spiritual paradise, a pure land. Currently, we have an 80-year lifespan and people only get to use 10-20% of their living time due to economic needs, so we have a world where most people don't develop much at all.",1300997940

That's possible, but that's more a science project than starting a company.<p>What I'm advocating (from experience) is that you should/must settle on a one thing before you start your company.  You can then iterate towards figuring out how to make your one thing work, gain traction, etc., but you need to at least know what the one thing you are trying to do is before you start your company.<p>e.g. just saying ""I want to do something in the storage space"" isn't enough.  You can spend the next 2 years trying a lot of things in the storage space.  That's experimenting.<p>But identifying a specific one thing you want to do in the storage space enables you to start a company.  Then, you can iterate towards the solution, but you need to start with a specific problem you want to solve.",1300996807

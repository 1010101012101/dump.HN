One&#x27;s used for Available After First Unlock, and that one&#x27;s stored in RAM till the device reboots. Another is used for items that are only available when unlocked, and that&#x27;s thrown away every time the phone is locked. Items that are restricted to the device use a key that is also derived from a private device identifier.<p>So not plaintext, but the decryption key is hanging around in the device.<p>You&#x27;re definitely on target with the suggestion for a background task token though.",1381388375

There are two reasons not to give specific feedback, even if it is requested:\n(1) A good proportion of candidates will disagree, argue, and waste a lot of your time. Think about how many people you know in real life who don&#x27;t want to accept the truth about some flaw they have. Probably all of us do this in some way.\n(2) In the US, any feedback beyond generic opens the employer up to creative lawsuits.

Seems mostly like a way for Google et al to fish for young talent before they graduate.</i><p>There is tremendous value in summer internships. You get to &quot;test out&quot; companies to work for after graduation. You get to learn <i>a ton</i> about actually using technologies in production and/or at scale. You get to learn from engineers who have years of industry experience. You get to work on technologies you would otherwise never work with (e.g. big data) by yourself. By the time you graduate, you will already have 9 months work experience, rather than 0, which makes starting a startup a more feasible option than before. I&#x27;m a little bewildered as to why you (or the culture in Europe?) find these internships pointless.<p>If what you say about the culture in Europe is true, I find this to actually be a competitive advantage for students/companies in the US.",1381388273

Quora reached out and asked if they could publish on Forbes, which I said was fine.  I updated to add the Yale example, which has already been discussed on HN, so I don&#x27;t rehash, but please note nobody has ever suggested Yale lied.  I&#x27;ve suggested they did not great science, which is very much not the same thing.<p>The statement &quot;Microsoft never did any of these industries any favors&quot; seems to be exactly what I&#x27;m talking about.  Can you honestly say that you think, in the many years that Microsoft have been producing some incredibly popular software that powers much of what makes modern business productive, that the company has done absolutely no good for anyone?

It&#x27;s as though they&#x27;re honestly surprised that anybody would ever want to leave the USA or make a phone call to anybody in another country.<p>An example:  I flew to the &#x27;states this weekend.  Once on the ground, I topped up my American (T-Mobile) sim with a month&#x27;s worth of credit.  (There was no way to do this from abroad since their sims don&#x27;t work there at all, and their website has a ridiculous country redirect even from your account page).<p>At the airport, on the way home, I sent a text to my wife letting her know I was on the way.  It failed.<p>I tried again to various permutations of the French number, with absolutely no success.  Googling around, it seems that you can&#x27;t do that with t-mobile.  You can&#x27;t even get them to turn it on, since their &quot;international&quot; packages only work with their contract services.  Not just roaming, but even placing a phone call to another country is impossible with pre-paid t-mobile.  Sure enough, landing in Paris, the phone was dead dead dead.  No &quot;welcome to France&quot; message.  No extortionate international roaming charges.  Just no ability to make calls at all.<p>I had to pop my UK sim back in just to be able to use the phone again.<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to the first company (in any country) that truly gets all this.

Having good internships, can, combined with other factors, put you over the top in getting admitted to elite schools. That being said, having good internships does not in of itself get you into elite schools. The only things that in of themselves can get you into elite schools are serious accomplishments - published a research paper, placed highly in a prestigious science fair, started a legitimate charitable organization, placed highly in some other competitive activity, etc.<p><i>> I&#x27;m unsure about whether or not I&#x27;ll look back in ten years and wish that I had taken advantage of my summers.</i><p>The grass is always greener on the other side.

The worst part of working\n    at Microsoft has nothing to do with our\n    internal culture (that’s not quite true;\n    more on that in a bit). It isn’t stack\n    ranking or ship cycles or trying to get\n    things done. It is working at a company\n    that people don’t believe in, despite\n    the immense importance it plays in\n    their daily life.\n</code></pre>\nUh, no. It&#x27;s the politics, and the stack ranking, and the interminably long ship cycles, and the typical unwillingness to even consider a market unless someone else has proven that it&#x27;s a billion dollar business. And especially the politics and the stack ranking. They&#x27;re absolutely toxic.<p>n.b. I haven&#x27;t worked there in six years (and in fact the ten year anniversary of my FTE interview was this week!), but my feelings on the matter have been confirmed in every conversation I&#x27;ve ever had with an ex-MSFT FTE. Call it survivorship bias if you want, but this has been consistent in every conversation I&#x27;ve had, regardless if the person left a year ago or five.<p>edit: and the in-fighting. and the backbiting... but I guess those are just politics by another name.",1381384824

I make a good income with my day job - I'm a medical doctor - so I have no financial motivations when it comes to programming, it's just something I like to do.<p>When I became interested in web development I spent some time learning Django. As a result, I put together Instant Django, a no-installation-required Django development environment for Windows, and I also wrote an introductory tutorial. Over the last few years I've had a couple hundred thousand downloads. I don't make any money from it, but a couple times a week someone emails me a thank you note, which gives me a little thrill.<p>Last year I decided to learn to program the iPhone, because it seemed interesting, and my 3 year old daughter loved to play with my phone.

Four payment schemes were chosen, to be implemented in four different cities.  Schools within the city were randomly assigned to the control or experimental group.<p>In New York, 4th graders were paid $25 for good test scores, 7th graders $50.  The article does not say how frequent the tests were, but the average student earned ~$180 over what looks like a school year.  No effect on scores vs. the control group.<p>In Chicago, 9th graders were paid ""$50 for each A, $35 for a B and $20 for a C, up to $2,000 a year,"" and half of their income went into an account redeemable at high school graduation.  The kids got better grades compared to the control group, but their skills--as measured by standardized test--did not improve.<p>The article is vague about Washington.  It says, ""In Washington, middle schoolers would be paid for a portfolio of five different metrics, including attendance and good behavior. If they hit perfect marks in every category, they could make $100 every two weeks.""  The kids ""did better on standardized reading tests.""<p>In Dallas, second graders were paid $2 for every book they successfully read and answered a quiz about.  The kids did significantly better in the standardized reading-comprehension test, and a year later--after the rewards stopped--their scores were <i>still</i> higher compared to the control group.<p>------------------------------<p>That's an awful lot of variables they changed from city to city.  Off the top of my head, I see<p><pre><code>  - Age of the students

  - Whether we're rewarding performance, grades, or improved behavior

  - Frequency of the reward

  - Delay between achievement and payment

  - How much direct control the student had over their performance

  - Level of initiative in student participation
</code></pre>
It strikes me as unsurprising that the Dallas experiment was successful.  The reward was for drilling the key skill (reading comprehension) opposed to an auxiliary like grades or behavior.  The payment was immediate (kids are bad at delayed gratification), opposed to days or even years later.  Students had good control over payoff for their efforts; reading a book and understanding it is concrete, while studying for a test when you don't know exactly what's on it is abstract.  And the whole thing driven by initiative on the part of the <i>student</i>, instead of an administratively mandated test schedule.  Those choices all seem to me to be better than the alternatives.<p>I do think the immediate feedback for solving concrete problems is important.  Kids are like puppies.  They need feedback FAST for something they UNDERSTAND and can CONTROL, or the lesson is greatly diminished.<p>If I were to generalize the success, I would recommend a standing offer to pay students to drill skills directly by solving concrete problems, with payment to be made <i>immediately</i> upon problem resolution.  You could scale it down to a penny per trivial arithmetic sum, or up to $200 for solving any of a list of independent research or engineering challenges.<p>I also find the success in Washington particularly interesting.  I'd speculate about kids learning to respect school or secondary effects from an improved learning environment, but . . . really I wish I could see their metrics.",1271011665

[...] The results reported are based on the first 500 participants in the Combined Transcranial and Extracranial Venus Doppler Evaluation study.<p>The preliminary results reported that at least 55 percent of the MS cohort participating in the initial phase of the study showed narrowing of the extracranial veins causing restriction of normal outflow of blood from the brain.

Toyota was the company that showed major growth (41%) and that was largely because they offered downright crazy incentives to draw in sales after their recent technical troubles<p>There are also factors they omitted...<p>Personal Bankruptcies were up 35% last month (the highest increase since the law was changed in 2005)<p>Earnings fell last month by $.02<p>Plus health care costs (and taxes for health care) are going to go up in the near term.

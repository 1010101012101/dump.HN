That is a better explanation of monads than the one I gave.<p>I intended my example to represent cases where you want real mutation, in the sense of modifying a data structure in place. Your code using the State monad, if I understand it correctly, just abstracts functional updates in a way that looks like mutation.<p>Anyway, my intent in my original comment was simply to explain the practical consequences of pure functional programming. That, for instance, if you have a pure function that you want to randomize, this change must be reflected in all the code that depends on it. My intuition is that this is a bad thing, but I don't have enough experience to say for sure. However, it is apparent to me that purity<p>1. adds a lot of complexity to the language, and<p>2. has no clear practical benefits,<p>which is why I say it's a waste of time.",1238273546

There were another 3 PC labs in the science building, and another PC lab and Mac lab in the library.  In the CS department, there were 2 unix labs, one with about 20 BSD+KDE machines, and the other with 10 SunOS+OpenWindows.  There was also the VAX/VMS system that anyone could use from anywhere via telnet, and provided access to all university services (including the ability to ssh into the Unix mainframe.)<p>Though I didn't really appreciate it at the time, the computer science education I got there was fantastic.  I've talked to friends and coworkers of mine who have masters degrees from ""good"" schools and I'm aghast at the gaping holes in the curricula.  Many of them never had to compile a program until they entered the work force, had never seen O() notation, and so on.<p>I think the moral of the story is that you should be wary of judging books by their covers: the campus might be beautiful, and the reputation might be sparkling, but take a look <i>inside</i> the buildings before choosing a school.",1238272737

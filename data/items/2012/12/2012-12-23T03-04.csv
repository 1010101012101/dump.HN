4958526,comment,4957992,4957992,16,0,aaronjg,,,"This is an interesting example of why randomization in experiments is important. If you allow users to self select into the experiment and control group, and then naively look at the results, the results might come up opposite from what is expected. This is known as Simpson's Paradox. In this case, it was only the users for whom page load was already the slowest that picked the faster version of the page. So naively looking at page load times made the pages look like they loaded slower.<p>However once Chris controlled for geography, he was able to find that there was a significant improvement.<p>Moral of the story: run randomized A/B tests, or be very careful when you are analyzing the results.",1356235175

4958524,comment,4958408,4958443,2,0,winter_blue,,,"True, but there are also things that don't get cheaper.<p>One good example is hosting. Linode/Rackspace monthly charges can eat your lunch.<p>Another is electronic equipment. Computers, smartphones and all other gadgets are not a tad bit cheaper -- they cost the same, and sometimes even more than they do in other countries.<p>Same applies to cars. A Camry will cost you nearly double its sticker price due to 104% tax on foreign-made cars. Indian-made cars cost $10'000 and up -- for nothing that even comes close to comfort and cruising of a Toyota/Nissan engine.<p>I know, I know; these are not big points -- what really upsets me though is -- being paid peanuts when people doing the exact same thing as you are making 10 or even 15 times more in other countries. I know people in Google, Zynga and other places all making $140k or more (in the U.S.)",1356235115

The needs that a small group of wealthy people have for human-created value is, well, small, and therefore wealth barely gets redistributed. Other factors compound this, like the fact that most of the proceeds from a market do not go to the (potentially many) people involved in producing the goods or services, but to those comparatively few with the capital to finance that activity; the chasm between the (so to speak) haves and the have nots grows bigger and bigger.<p>At that point, a significant segment of society simply can't earn a living, and society must adapt to become sustainable again.<p>It's not the kind of thing that happens overnight, but you can see how most forces are pushing in that direction, so without a fundamental change in the dynamics of production, market and compensation, it's not a question of if, but when.",1356234358

My argument, is that in the end it's just biological. We're built this way (not all, but most of us). Perhaps for good reasons, perhaps not, but it doesn't really matter. We can't rationalize or deconstruct it any better than we can needing sex, fearing the dark or the extreme reaction a person has to waterboarding. It just is how it is - we evolved to want privacy, and now we <i>need</i> it and that's that. Trying to deconstruct ""why"" we want it at a deeper level might be interesting, but it is not useful for producing counter arguments to the ""nothing to hide, nothing to fear"" argument, in fact it is counterproductive, because it values the most important argument of all with zero weight. Further it just prompts people to come up with ""solutions"" that address the lower level issues and still leave us with our biological sense of privacy invasion.",1356234280

No bootstrap or framework either. Plain old markup and stylesheets. It uses very little Javascript (no Jquery either), just what the simple UI requires (an event listener for the enter key, and an event listener for 4 links). Nothing else. No animations. No fancy scrolling. No caroussels. Nothing like that. Its rendered on the server side (Django), and gets served to you in a very small package. I even went as far as breaking down the stylesheets so that you dont need to download CSS that does not apply to the page you are visiting. And you know what? It works, feels, and looks amazing. Even if the project ends up being a failure, acheiving such little victories are just deliciously fun.<p>Where did I get the inspiration to go against the current industry trends?

They didn't need me down there, but it was a very measurable output of my work.<p>I might have to disagree with the other comment here about Amazon Fulfillment. It may relieve you of a lot of the logistics, but it will also greatly affect how you resolve issues -- bad batches of products, customer service, wrong/missing parts...<p>At the end of the day what matters in physical goods e-commerce is amazing customer service, and you cannot do that unless you have access to the warehouse. You have to have physical access to the product. You have to have a good relationship with the fedex/ups drivers and account managers. You have to work fedex and ups against each other when the time comes to renegotiate your rates.<p>When you outsource too many parts of your business you end up too dependent on too many variables you cannot control. Your business continuity becomes more opaque.<p>Another story: same company in 2005, South Florida-- post hurricane Katrina and Wilma. Because we controlled a lot of the variables and relationships (logistics, internet, warehousing) we were able to do the following:<p><pre><code>  * Redirect the 800 number to a vonage 
    line and send our customer service 
    staff up to an Orlando hotel room to 
    keep answering phones.

  * Because of our good relationship with 
    fedex we were able to get them to send 
    an empty truck down from Atlanta to 
    pickup in Boca Raton.

  * We processes printing labels and tickets 
    over a 2G wifi connection.

They understand that some human workers may lose out in the race against the machine. Ironically, the best-educated economists are often the most resistant to this idea, as the standard models of economic growth implicitly assume that economic growth benefits all residents of a country.</i><p>No important model of economic growth assumes that growth or technological progress benefits everyone. What <i>is</i> broadly assumed (and there's a lot of empirical evidence behind it) is that innovation is <i>the</i> prime driver of economic growth, particularly in advanced capitalist economies.<p>Economic growth means that society is gaining wealth in aggregate. And so long as the pie is growing, it is always possible, in principle, to allocate the gains in a Pareto-efficient manner (that is, in a manner in which <i>everybody</i> gains) through the political process. Therefore many economists consider the ""distributional"" question, concern about who gets what, to be of secondary importance to their field. They see their job as figuring out how to maximize the size of the pie and leave it to others to figure out how to divvy it up. (Economists do of course have a lot to say about how various ways of distributing the gains from growth affect the prospects for future growth.)<p><i>> Shortly after the Luddites began smashing the machinery that they thought threatened their jobs, the economist David Ricardo, who initially thought that advances in technology would benefit all, developed an abstract model that showed the possibility of technological unemployment.</i><p>What the author is eliding here is Ricardo's development of the idea of comparative advantage [0], one of the truly remarkable ideas in economics. Comparative advantage is basically the idea that even if one country (or firm, or group of people, or single person, or whatever economic unit you want to think about) is better at producing <i>every</i> conceivable good or service, that country (firm/group/person/etc) will still gain from specializing in producing the good or service it (they/he/she/etc) is relatively best at producing, then trading with otherswho will also gain by the interaction.<p>This insight does not mean that everyone will always gain from freer trade, or from innovation (which can be thought of as essentially similar in this regard to a relaxation of trade barriers with a country that's particularly adept at producing one good or another). But it does suggest that there is a <i>net gain</i> to be had from these developments. And, again, economists are primarily concerned with growing the pie.<p><i>> At least since the followers of Ned Ludd smashed mechanized looms in 1811, workers have worried about automation destroying jobs. Economists have reassured them that new jobs would be created even as old ones were eliminated. For over 200 years, the economists were right.</i><p>And that, really, is where I would leave things. There is very little to suggest that technological progress is about to take on a fundamentally different character, or entail much different results, than it has had, and has done, throughout the course of human history. When the singularity arrives, let's have this conversation again.<p>0. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage</a>",1356232524

4958415,comment,4957401,4957401,1,0,aufreak3,,,"> Companies spend millions of dollars and often decades testing drugs; every drug must outperform placebos if it is to be marketed. If we can identify people who have a low predisposition for placebo response, drug companies can preselect for them, says Winkler. This could seriously reduce the size, cost, and duration of clinical trialsbringing cheaper drugs to the market years earlier than before.<p>Wat? Is that a typo? Shouldn't it be ""preselect against them""? .. or better still, include predisposition to placebo response as a variable?",1356232401

The company spent a lot of time and money dicking around with developing some custom ecommerce stuff, tieing in an ordering system to their customer service dept, etc.<p>Then they'd show it, have meetings, make changes, etc.  Did this for multiple <i>years</i>.  And made a handful of sales.  Why?  Because they never promoted it (either under their own name or another).  Why not?  Because they didn't want to 'upset' their current channel partners.  But they'd investigated direct sales for a few years because the channel wasn't delivering.<p>Absolutely ridiculous, and it would not surprise me one bit if I could call China and order the exact versions of what they made and have them shipped to my house faster than ordering from this company in Chicago.<p>I'm not suggesting all companies are like this by a long shot, but I've seen inside more than enough to understand just how inefficient many companies are, and this idea of 'protecting' the supply chain will be a pretty moot point as it becomes easier and easier to order direct from alibaba vendors and have things shipped over in days vs waiting for the appropriate field-sales-marketing-division-exec-vp-manager to fire up their outlook and hunt-and-peck a typo-laden form letter complete with out-of-date brochure/price-list.",1356232322

5958659,comment,5958580,5958580,1,0,bhauer,,,"Your second point is right on the money.  Failure to integrate with my Windows household is my chief complaint [1] with my Windows Phone (a Nokia Lumia 920).<p>You cite USB ports, but I think that&#x27;s going after the wrong kind of integration.  Here&#x27;s what bothers me most: my Windows Phone doesn&#x27;t just seamlessly join my Windows &quot;HomeGroup&quot; network, and it should.  Doing so would be a killer app in my household.  All Microsoft devices should adopt a HomeGroup (or an evolution thereof) model, where sharing of resources is expected.<p>When I take a photo around the house, it should not only be automatically uploaded to Skydrive as it is now.  Since the phone is on my wifi network, the photo should be immediately dropped onto my file server&#x27;s Photos library.<p>When I fire up the music application, it should (a) be able to play anything from my file server&#x27;s music library, and (b) act as a DLNA remote to my various PCs, including the one in the living room hooked to the big speakers.<p>It should be comfortable joining other &quot;HomeGroups&quot; or similar ad hoc private networks.  If I am out and about with my Windows Phone 8 and Surface Pro--and I am usually carrying both--the two should play well together--over an encrypted private channel--whenever they are both on the same wifi network.  If I receive a Skype message, I should <i>not</i> have to dismiss it on both devices; they should each know I&#x27;ve been notified.  (This last bit speaks a bit to my desire for &quot;personal application omnipresence&quot;--a model where applications run single instances with multiple responsive views, all exclusively for me [2].)<p>Integration remains the most lacking and frustrating element of multi-device lifestyles, and it&#x27;s not a problem exclusive to Microsoft, but it&#x27;s one that I specifically want Microsoft to address.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tiamat.tsotech.com/lumia-920"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiamat.tsotech.com/lumia-920</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://tiamat.tsotech.com/pao"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiamat.tsotech.com/pao</a>",1372435119

You said nothing about severity of the punishment.<p>Well, I said &quot;Personally, I would add that acceptance of punishment reduces your ability to deceive yourself into thinking you&#x27;re disobeying for the greater good, rather than just for your own personal gain or fame.&quot; I thought that was implicit in the &quot;reducing&quot;, in the sense that the avoidance of self-deception was not full, and presumably depends on the size of the punishment.  Sorry if this was unclear.<p>>Please be careful about suggesting I am avoiding the arguments of practitioners like MLK, et al. I am specifically dealing with the philosophical debate around civil disobedience<p>I meant no disrespect.  I meant &quot;avoid&quot; in the same way a physicists proposing a new particle avoids constraints placed by existing experiments on the properties of that particle.  He does this by specifying the properties of the proposed particle in a way that ensures it would not have already been seen.<p>> It is not inconceivable that a disobedient might act in such a manner...for the sake of personal gain and/or fame.<p>Not inconceivable, but it does make it much more unlikely.<p>> &quot;His submission to punishment justifies his actions,&quot; that is a very dangerous maxim to put into play,...<p>I definitely never meant to suggest this.",1372434947

This is a direct impediment to start ups, the reason being that most start ups fail and in the USA there is an understanding of this. In the USA employees demand stock options as upside should the start up succeed knowing that there will be no severance package should the start up fail.  But I have yet to find a place in Europe where employees or governments truly understand this.  Not only are forced severance pay packages a problem because most start ups fail and they still have to pay them, but also because start ups are constantly trying out people and the concept of trying out people is very costly in Europe.  In some countries like France, forced severance packages of people who have been with you say only half a year can be as high as double their earnings during that time. For most Europeans stock options are considered a scam to pay them less.&quot;",1372434798

But what I worry about is that the &quot;guidance&quot; you&#x27;d receive in situations like this is more guidance to a set of predetermined ideals or conclusions, rather than guidance into how best to find your own. It&#x27;s incredibly hard to do anything so deeply introspective without bumping up against existential issues. I feel like having someone guide you through this process requires a ridiculous amount of trust in how they value your individualism.<p>As an anecdote, my wife just competed her 200 hour yoga teacher certification which included a two day retreat to an ashram. Like you said about being told that the chanting is not rite or ritual, they constantly said that yoga isn&#x27;t spiritual or religious. But in surveying the whole of yoga there are definitely parts of it that are at least &quot;mystical&quot; if not religious. For some of it you can just say &quot;they&#x27;re not being literal, this is metaphorical&quot; but other parts, such as the chakras, are hard to see through that lens [Edit: as another lesser-known example, see mudras, hand [1] or otherwise]. And then even where there isn&#x27;t any mysticism there is plenty of &quot;holistic&quot; discipline or rigor being taught.<p>When I went to her graduation ceremony one of the fellow students told me that the biggest thing that she got out of the training was the knowledge that when we die, our energy lives on. While this <i>is</i> literally true, she clearly meant it in a very spiritual sense.<p>As a complete outsider it&#x27;s hard not to see this in a religious light. To the issue of trust in those who are guiding your introspective thoughts, I see this situation as a huge barrier.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.eyogaforbeginners.com/hand-mudra-meanings-explanations-and-benefits/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eyogaforbeginners.com/hand-mudra-meanings-explana...</a>",1372434553

There where devices with less than usable touchscreens (including resistive) and in some cases no touchscreens. These are the myriad of devices from Shenzen, one after another, running Android derived from AOSP.<p>At the same time, these devices were only one of the problems. Google was fighting against companies putting the Market on devices that could barely run Android, couldn&#x27;t run 3D games that were available in the market, didn&#x27;t support playback of video formats that were commonly used in the games and other applications, and had other limitations.<p>The availability of the devices contributed to Android&#x27;s popular image as a low-end platform, with Apple&#x27;s iPhone being the premium device. Remember, this was during the Android 1.0 and early 2.0 days.<p>At the same time, it was clear that Android needed to support multiple platforms. I asked one of the developers in IRC at the time when we would see a &quot;set-back box&quot; running Android, or systems for vehicles. The response was along the lines of &quot;let&#x27;s concentrate on phones first.&quot;<p>Now we are seeing a perfectly reasonable restriction in the Market (now Play Store) license being used to exclude a new product category from the officially supported application store where Google collects a healthy cut.<p>Also, doesn&#x27;t the Ouya controller have a touchscreen, and even run Android on it&#x27;s own internal CPU/GPU? It&#x27;s not clear to me from the Kickstarter description but it would make sense.<p>The trade-off here for Ouya is either collecting the share of the revenues for themselves, including possibly through their own free-to-play credits system, or having a large number of partially supported games which were not designed to use a controller. I can see that whether it was the original plan or not, having their own application store makes sense for Ouya if they can get the developer attention they need.<p>That&#x27;s really what I&#x27;m talking about here, Google&#x27;s careless implications of creating a competing console may have the effect of confusing potential buyers at Target or GameStop as to which Android console to buy.

I wanted to be explicit about this because I do disagree with the conclusions you draw but not because you are drawing them.<p>The problem with making the access of public, unclassified systems punishable by UCMJ seems obvious to me. I do not think you agree with this being a problem. I&#x27;m open to your exposition and I hope you are to mine.<p>If tomorrow is the day that Greenwald will publish Snowden&#x27;s leaked information then today the Guardian is a website that a solider can access without UCMJ consequence. The common soldier does not possess a security clearance. Among those who do, they do not have access to the material Snowden leaked. That is highly compartmentalized. Therefore, even soldiers with a Top Secret (TS) clearance would not recognize classified information leaked by Snowden as being authentic. The information is on an unclassified system on non-mil, non-gov domain. Greenwald and Snowden claiming it is leaked classified material isn&#x27;t sufficient for a common soldier to regard the data as such. This requires verification by senior commissioned personnel. Command must inform unwitting soldiers that the information they are reading is classified. Until they do, the soldier cannot be certain. This is effectively classifying any information published by the Guardian as TS. It is unlawful, then, for the soldier to use an unclassified system to access a classified system. If this was only about justifying a block or filter then there&#x27;d be little to discuss. But this is about making the soldier&#x27;s exposure to classified information unlawful, witting or otherwise. Most problematic to me is the fact that command issued this statement to formally classify the information as the soldier is concerned. That is one shade of grey apart from command divulging classified information to personnel that do not possess the clearance.<p>Command recognizes that they are partly corroborating Snowden&#x27;s leak if they specifically refer to the content of the documents. They&#x27;ve been careful to cover their ass, though. Instead of explicitly citing the classified information, they classified the source- the entire system. This is the precedent that concerns me. This is command classifying information to empower them to leverage the maximum authorized penalty under UCMJ. This is worse than censorship. This makes reading certain public domain a criminal act.<p>To your final point I cannot understand your reasoning. Yes, it is a voluntary act. It is a service that people volunteer for that benefits the entire nation. It benefits many other nations. And for this you want to strip them of something? These individuals volunteered to be engaged in the needs of the military. That&#x27;s to say they aren&#x27;t guaranteed they will be or do any particular thing. They will be and do what they are told. In some situations that&#x27;s compromised the individual in ways that would be criminal outside of service. And to that we say, &quot;you volunteered and signed your life away&quot;?<p>The soldier volunteered to do a job others wouldn&#x27;t. In cases like these, the soldier hopes civilians will volunteer to do what they cannot. I elect to speak out against this and demand clarification. I charge this is unlawful and dangerous beyond any soldier reading a website might be because the soldier cannot.<p>What course of action do you propose to a soldier that might be reading this? If what was happening was unlawful in your eyes, what would you suggest is done by the soldier?",1372433263

I like the web interface, it is fast and has less bloat than Google Reader&#x27;s interface did (a plus for me - I was a big fan of Bloglines way back when and it was very streamlined) and supports everything I want to do (read/organize by folder, save stories).  I was confused by the sharing in the app at first - I don&#x27;t really care about a &#x27;blurblog&#x27; and just wanted to share a story on Facebook - so I&#x27;ve switched to just copy/pasting the URL instead of using built in functionality, but I could be missing something.

In 2002-2003 most of the provinces&#x27; and territories&#x27; courts ruled that they could marry.<p>And finally, in 2005, same-sex couples gained full marriage equality at the federal level after several drama-filled months in the House of Commons that included one MP (Belinda Stronach) crossing the floor then retiring from politics, attempts to bribe another MP (Chuck Cadman) on his deathbed, and several MPs (including the Prime Minister, Paul Martin, and former Prime Minister, Jean Crtien) being denied communion at their church.<p>Then it was over. In 2006 the law was upheld in a free vote under a new Conservative Party government, thus cementing the law and ending all serious debate about overturning it.<p>So really, things changed over the course of 10 years here in Canada (1995-2005), and same-sex couples have had full marriage equality for 8 years now. A whole generation is coming of age now in the time since gay marriage was legalized. People entering adulthood now at at 18 years old were 10 years old when the law was passed -- too young to have been concerned about things like this.<p>At best, they only vaguely remember that there was once a debate about it. To them it&#x27;s been legal &#x27;forever&#x27;. They hear about the marriage equality debate going on in the states, but even the more conservative teenagers (mostly, ones who have conservative parents) don&#x27;t understand what all the fuss is about.<p>Frankly, I don&#x27;t either.",1372432255

For those who don&#x27;t know, it essentially involves taking the costs associated with producing a product (in his case, his time) and marking up the cost to some amount above that to ensure sufficient margins.<p>The fact is that when people buy a product they don&#x27;t really care about what it cost you to produce, they care about what value they can extract from it. A classic example of this is the fragrance market, where people routinely pay $80 for a 2.5 ounce bottle of cologne that cost less than two dollars to produce. They do this because they imagine it will make them more attractive, so to them, $80 is a small price to pay and don&#x27;t really care about the markup.<p>Some businesses can mark software up higher and higher and increase sales and profits because they are providing a large value proposition in the form of huge time savings, more sales, etc.<p>Because he only mentioned the time he invested and the existing bottom-of-the-barrel pricing as the reasons all software shops should raise prices, I have to say his logic is mostly flawed.",1372431864

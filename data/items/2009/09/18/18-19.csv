Sales guys would  be able to hit a button and orders would flow directly into our product for execution -- eliminating overhead, reducing errors, and improving yield by allowing better forecasting and delivery.<p>The large multinational conducted a review, and told us that in order to avoid running afoul of corporate standards, we'd have to migrate our sales tracking to SAP, and integrate with SAP instead. The project was put on hold. The hold grew longer when it turned out that currency issues in the large multinational's SAP implementation would prevent us from billing certain foreign customers in their local currency.  Then we realized our budget wouldn't permit us to use this radically more expensive product, and there wasn't a magic SAP budget out there for us to tap into.  A year later, we were still using salesforce.com, without a connection to our core product.<p>I'm all in favor of acquisitions, and this will probably be a great thing for mint -- contrary to (say) the rant from 37signals today.

For example: I get paid $X per month, direct deposit to my savings account.  I then transfer $Y to checking, and $Z to investment accounts (NOTE: not buying investments yet, just staging it). According to Mint I now have an income of $X+$Y+$Z for the month, and have spent $Y+$Z.  When I by investments that amount also gets added to both income and expense totals.<p>It seems to me that doubly entry bookkeeping was invented at least 1000 years ago, and handles the whole funds transfer thing just fine without misreporting income.

No need to make it easier on the spammers to figure out how to bypass the various features that keep the junk in check. Otherwise HN would turn into a useless linkdump in a heart beat.<p>But stuff like article tagging would be tremendously useful, especially in combination with a filtering function.<p>The feature request thread has lots of good ideas, if you want I can spend some time to make a digest.<p>I realize you have lots on your plate but that is precisely the reason why 'life is too short', if the end result of that is that HN feels stagnant (and in some ways it does, even though I can see there is some subtle tuning going on behind the scenes and by the number of restarts) then that seems like a lost opportunity to me.<p>HN - and arc - are clearly your babies and you get to make the calls, but I'm sure there are enough people of caliber here to help out, and if you tell them 'not good enough' when they present a patch I'm sure they'll try harder, that way you could simply do the quality control end of that.<p>It'd still be work, but a lot less work than building all those features yourself.<p>Another thing that came to mind the other day is maybe you do not want to risk eclipsing digg by building a HN that is too good, is that a factor here or rather not ?",1253299780

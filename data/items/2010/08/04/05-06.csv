1573773,comment,1573304,1573304,0,0,tzs,,,"The network interface in general on most operating systems seems kind of absurd from a server point of view. You've got data coming in from N clients. The data from all those clients gets physically multiplexed into a single data stream that comes in over the wire.<p>Then in the kernel you've got something that demultiplexes it back into N separate streams, which it accumulates in N different buffers.<p>The server software is aware of all N of these streams. Through some mechanism the kernel notifies the server software that data is available on some subset of the N buffers, and the server software has to ask for that data.<p>If the server software is using a queue and thread model, it likely then gets that data which the kernel has gone to great effort to demultiplex into N streams and provide it through N separate file descriptors--and multiplexes back onto a single queue for the worker threads to pull from!<p>Why not get rid of some of this demultiplexing and re-multiplexing? Let me have a single file descriptor, and everything that comes in destined to my port comes through that single file descriptor, as a message with a header that tells what remote IP address and port it came from and the length, followed by that many bytes of data.<p>Instead of N separate buffers in the kernel, just have one big buffer per port. You'd still have to keep track of how many bytes in that buffer are associated with each remote connection, for purposes of dealing with TCP flow control, but I think this could be made to work reasonably (yes, I'm hand waving right now).<p>Now you don't need poll or epoll. Heck, you don't even need to use select. I'll just have a blocking thread whose job is to just read that one file descriptor using blocking reads in a loop to pull in data and put it on my queue.<p>Looking at this slightly different--everything destined for, say, port 80 is going to the web server, so why does the web server want this to come in through N different file descriptors? Especially when you consider that the code its going to run is the same no matter which it comes in on? All the multiple file descriptors are really accomplishing is providing a way to tell which bytes came from which client. Is that really the best use of file descriptors, as opposed to just having the kernel tell you which client the data came from when you do your read system call?<p>I can see that the N file descriptor model made sense in the days before threads, when to get concurrency you had to use multiple processes. You then need to have data coming in on port X from different clients not necessarily all going to the same process.<p>But for servers that are going to use the ""single process with multiple threads"" model to handle concurrency, a single stream network model would seem to be a lot nicer and efficient.",1280901485

1573769,comment,1571216,1573543,0,0,dkarl,,,"First, if you read the threads where this stuff comes up, you'll see that most of these discussions are in the context of work and dating, both situations where personal exposure goes way, way beyond what you can learn from stereotypes.  In particular, the desire to abstractly characterize women reflects a sad attempt to depersonalize, out of fear, what should be a very personal, individual relationship.  (Don't try to tell me that the guys driving these discussions are all dealing with aggregates of women -- they <i>wish</i> they were dealing with aggregates of women, because dealing with <i>individual</i> women is too confusing and distressing for them.)<p>Second, hiring a babysitter is a terrible example of making a snap decision based on age and sex.  I've never heard of parents hiring a babysitter without personal familiarity or references.  Lots of grandmothers are incredibly ignorant about child care, even downright irresponsible.  Hell, in areas where meth is popular, I bet grandmothers do a lot more meth than 13-year-old boys.<p>Hiring guys to do heavy lifting is actually a decent example, but I've never seen any discussions on the internet about how to pick good workers from the crowd of day laborers hanging out near Home Depot.  Do you take the young, wiry guy or the gray-haired guy who's built like a tank?  Are tattoos a bad sign?  You haven't read any discussions like that on HN.  No, instead, people talk about how to have a deep understanding of women's sexual desires (scary and bad) and moral scruples (even more scary and bad) without actually knowing a woman.",1280901235

Rarely was I ever told why I would want to use those formulas.<p>My best class was a chemistry course taught by a 60 year old man that used to test missiles at one point. The grades never really mattered and as long as you knew the vocabulary he would pass you.  But where he made a difference was giving us examples of why stuff worked along with how.  For the final we had to determine what an unknown substance was.  There was no right method to do this, just simply a number of different tests that we had to do and be able to understand what the results were.  We then had to 'think' as to what it might mean about the substance we were testing.  He set us free and we passed and failed on our own accord because it was up to the students to read the book to try and find just one more test that might give a better result.<p>The one lasting comment that my chemistry teacher told me was that he was not concerned with how well we memorized things because he knew we would forget.  There would always be time to read up on whatever we were doing on the job.  He wanted us to have the core understanding so that when we did look up the boiling point or specific gravity of a compound we would know what those facts would signify as opposed to learning stats on the more common elements.

What I've been saying all along is something very simple.<p>If the ATR > 0.6, poll wins.  If ATR < 0.6, epoll wins.<p>That means, there's <i>potential</i> gains to be had by using both, and at a minimum you can use both and it won't hurt you very much.<p>Additionally, Mongrel2 isn't a regular server.  Remember all those pesky 0MQ backends?  Those basically crank data fast as shit, so this research could potentially benefit them.  It also points out potential flaws in previous analyses, so people can now potentially use ATR to tune their server's work loads appropriately.<p>But notice I keep saying potentially?  So far I'm the only one offering everything up, all data, everything for anyone to prove me wrong, and I actually don't think I'm totally right.<p>I don't see very many other people who criticize the idea doing the same.

This is the one they've all been using.  So, either you write your own test to evaluate the same thing, without confounding it with other external factors (like this test does), or you use this test and prove me wrong by finding different data.<p>However, I'm glad you finally went and got some metrics to show one webserver instead of the useless rhetoric you were spewing before.  Not that it proves a damn thing since it has no external validity, but at least it's a step in the right direction.<p>I also say that your findings of 40% are <i>much</i> higher than what you implied in your previous comments.  You made it seem like it's close to the 10% range, but 40% is damn near ready to leap over into the equal performance levels.  It's interesting that even after that you still can't see the value of either making epoll faster or using both, but whatever, you can't convince every idiot on the internet, even with Science.",1280898682

They deploy Apache, because it's easy (every distro comes with an excellent default set of LAMP packages, for obvious reasons.) Thus, Mongrel (or any other non-mindshare-majority server) is only sought out by those who don't like the one they've got—that is, by people who are not getting the performance they desire.<p>Mongrel is probably not used by Joe the VPS user, serving 20 simultaneous connections per hour, because Joe is doing just fine with the Apache install that came with his slice. Mongrel <i>is</i> deployed for high-traffic file servers, as the current weapon of choice.<p>It's very likely that that will continue to be its niche (though it will expand out somewhat as larger shared-hosting providers start to default to it), so it's very likely to mostly see use in high-ATR deployment scenarios. <i>Under that assumption</i>, Zed's experiment is solid. I would still like to see a prologue tacked on about the composition of the Mongrel user base, though, if Zed has it :)<p>Edit: rephrased to... sound less like Zed?",1280898644

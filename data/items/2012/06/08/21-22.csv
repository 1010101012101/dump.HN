Given any word problem that you were supposed to solve that way, I could solve it in my head.  It wasn't until I was shown that I couldn't solve 3 equations in 3 variables that I realized that I needed to learn the boring way.<p>Secondly the single most useful thing that I did in school was try to generate a table of how likely it was to get various dice rolls when you rolled 4 6-sided dice and took the top 3.  I learned a lot from that, and that sparked my interest in math.<p>Thirdly my biggest complaint about the way we teach stuff is that we present matrices and matrix multiplication with no context.  It makes no sense to people.  But if you know what a linear function, and realize that a matrix is just a way to write one down, then matrix multiplication turns out to be just function composition.<p>Just think how surprising the associative law is for matrix multiplication.  I remember sitting there thinking, ""How on Earth did anyone think it up, and see the associative law?""  It becomes something you memorize because it makes no sense.<p>But the associative law always holds for function composition. Given three functions f, g, h and a thing they act on v, then by definition:<p>((f o g) o h)(v) = (f o g)(h(v)) = f(g(h(v))) = f((g o h)(v)) = (f o (g o h))(v)<p>Since matrix multiplication is just a way to write out function composition for a certain class of functions, it likewise must follow the associative law.  THAT is how they thought it up!<p>I can hear the complaints already.  ""Oh, but this is too abstract for college students, they can't possibly understand this approach!""  Bull.  They can, and they do if you have the guts to present it this way.  I've done it, with success.",1339192072

Redmine is, in my opinion a big letdown on so many points and Springloops is riddled with bugs for the moment (they're working hard on it) and time management is not flexible at all (can't export time between two dates, etc).<p>So I'm asking out, what are you using?

I'm actually developing something called ""NewNet"" in UT99 for fun - plus, more people actually still play that game than all the others!  Basically it fixes the movement lag associated with high pings and simulates zero ping by keeping track of the positions of all actors from within the past second or so, and ""rewinding"" the server to that saved position according to the ping of the shooter.  There are mods for UT2003/UT2004 (UE2) and UT3 that do this, but nothing for UT99 - although there's the ZeroPing mod which is way too easy to exploit, as it's clientside hit detection.  People said it couldn't be done for UT99 but I've managed to get a working prototype, even though it's quite messy and hacked together.

Add a flag column to your password database; whenever anyone signs in without the flag set, encrypt their password the old way (for checking against their old entry in the database) and the new way (for storage in the database) and set their flag. The only trouble is, users who never log in don't get migrated.<p>2. It's possible to treat the old encrypted form of the password as if it's plaintext, salt that, encrypt with bcrypt, and store the result in the database. Then password checking becomes: encrypt password with old algorithm, salt, encrypt with bcrypt, and check against the database. It lets you convert everyone at once, but makes the login code a little more complicated, forever. If you can't convert everyone's database entry at once, you might still want a flag column, so you can migrate more gradually.<p>There are still all the usual headaches of QA, release management, etc., but presumably you already know how to handle them.

4086163,comment,4085372,4085372,12,0,ilaksh,,,"This brings up a very prevalent false dichotomy and some interesting psychological issues that are holding back software development.<p>The false dichotomy is the idea that you can have either well engineered and powerful systems that are complex and difficult to program, or you can have poorly engineered, simple systems that are easy to program.<p>There is a conflict here which is a little bit like the inherent opposition of technology and business (most people aren't aware of this issue either, of course, but that's a whole other comment for people to dismiss).  The tools which make software development easier and more efficient, both for experienced professionals as well as for beginners, also make software development more accessible, reduce the amount of traditional programming being done and therefore mean it requires less programming skill to accomplish the same thing.<p>This means that as new, more powerful programming tools appear, you can actually be fairly sure that the programmers who have only used those tools have less experience than programmers who use older, less powerful tools.  Even worse, since everyone knows the tools are easier to use, there is a social dynamic and pressure warning programmers off of them: its basically cheating.<p>Many programmers are still acting like calligraphers in an area where the printing press has just recently been introduced.  What self-respecting calligrapher uses a machine to print text?  Its not even calligraphy.<p>I had to stop using Visual Basic anything just because I knew people would judge me as being a lesser programmer if I took advantage of the easier and more productive tool.<p>Peer pressure, pretty much at the level of 12-year-olds, is the main thing holding back deployment and advancement of technology in all aspects of our 'society'.",1339189630

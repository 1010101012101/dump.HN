There is so much wrong with all of these questions, and that's only one of the things wrong with this particular one.<p>In addition to that, there's very good reason for someone to act differently when it's a gain vs. loss at stake.  For one thing, this difference is the whole reason that an insurance industry can exist!  (And insurance, in turn, is the only reason many kinds of utility-enhancing ventures can exist at all!)<p>I used to wonder what the point of insurance was when you could just bear the risk yourself, but then I had an insight (that no one else arguing with me managed to bring up):<p>Diminishing marginal utility implies increasing marginal <i>dis</i>utility!<p>Utility as a function of how much of a good G that you have, usually increases at a decreasing rate.  The first n units provide more of a utility gain than the 2nd n units, and so on.  For much the same reason, losing your first n units isn't as bad as losing the 2nd n units, and so on.  (It may help to visualize U(n) as a logarithmic curve.)<p>This is why people can rationally regard it as better to have a guaranteed loss of (at least) N rather than a (1/x) chance of losing x times N, while not also buying a lottery ticket for N that offers a (1/x) chance of gaining x times N.  And that, in turn, shows the fundamental asymmetry between insurance and gambling.<p>Kahnemann must be on the phone with VF right now demanding they correct this article in about ten places.",1325865433

3433653,comment,3433377,3433377,33,0,danso,,,"It's ""no-duh"" that yoga can hurt you. But what makes the exercise particularly dangerous is that people go into it because it is seen as a recuperative, healing exercise. And the nature of it makes it easy to get into and possibly go too far.<p>Compare it to swimming, which is also seen as a recuperative exercise. But in swimming, it is very difficult to accidentally over-exert yourself...you'll get too tired. So the danger of someone who is completely out of shape going too far is minimal. However, in yoga, it is very <i>easy</i> to go too far because just <i>entering</i> or holding (what seemed easy to get into) the poses may overstrain a muscle or joint.<p>And let's not discount the mindset of many yoga practitioners, novice and expert. Swimming may be a healing sport, but it has the connotation of being a <i>sport</i>. Yoga is seen as not just a physical activity, but as a way to connect spiritually, be at inner peace, and not worry about competition (even if it implicitly happens, as demonstrated in the article). So there is additional danger is in the naive mindset of yoga practitioners...comparatively few people go into long-distance running with the belief that it won't have impact on their knees or back.<p>* Another way to look at it...speaking from personal experience...there is a high correlation between people who are really into yoga and people who are really into doing periodical ""cleanses""...that is, diets in which they spend $200 (no exaggeration) for three days of juice-only servings. This may also be a peculiarity of living in Manhattan...yet I know of other athletes in the city who would never consider doing a juice-diet, or who believe in the ""science"" of cleanses.<p>The point is is that yoga attracts people who want a less rigorous way of being healthy, and these people may not realize that yoga can be as damaging as standard weightlifting.",1325864297

3433645,comment,3431037,3431625,6,0,fossuser,,,"I think the main problem with modern copyright is its length.  Originally you had to register for copyright protection and it lasted 14 years (28 if renewed) before entering public domain.  It was also primarily used to curb commercial infringement.  The purpose of copyright is to ""To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.""[1]  The limited monopoly is simply the means to encourage creative work.<p>The current time frame of 70 years after the death of the artist distorts the purpose - it's no longer about encouraging creating works, but rather artists controlling and profiting for generations.  This, in tandem with orphan works, makes nearly the last 100 years of culture off limits from the public.  Perhaps most strangely the copyright time extensions have been retroactive which is really bizarre considering that people clearly don't need to be incentivized to create works they already created.<p>Today you can't even opt for something to be in the public domain, the best you can do is license it permissively.  Unfortunately, because of large powerful interests and the heavy distortion of copyright's purpose I feel the problem is only going to get worse.<p>If I had the power to change copyright I'd do this:<p>1. Must register for protection (no implied copyright).<p>2. Lasts 7 years (14 with renewal) before entering public domain.<p>3.  Non-profit sharing is not illegal.<p>Of these three points, the third is the most controversial.  My opinion is that without draconian measures you can't stop file sharing.  I also think the ability to make instantaneous and very cheap copies is one of the primary advantages of digital goods (making them non-rival goods).  The public benefits from the ability to share and there is too much waste policing it.  It would be better for businesses to adapt and find the advantages within the system (much how they already do).<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause</a>",1325864189

I live in Northern New Jersey over breaks.<p>What I will be bringing to the table is a credible knowledge of accounting, finance, economics, marketing and other business subjects. My major is going to be Managerial Economics so that is my specialty. Most importantly I bring with me an entrepreneurial spirit, which I have found is a very important, but rare commodity.<p>I am interested nearly any intellectual topic, and actively seek out to know as much as I can about said topic. Although my education has been as a business person, I would rather think of myself simply as a non-technical cofounder. I say this because I have always been quite good with computers both on the front-end and coding. I have only coded very basic programs, but I understand the mindset, and respect the art. And I am certainly not a hands-off kind of guy.<p>I would prefer someone who is in college or college-aged and understands the time constrains we have to deal with, as well as willing to take more risk. I would like for us to both share in responsibilities, and to specialize as well. I would like for us to be as knowledgeable about our aspects of business as each others. You would be in charge of the technical side of the business, and I would be more focused on everything else, however that doesnt mean that I will not learn some programming and fully understand how the technology works. I want us to supplement each other in skill, and learn from each other in what we lack. It doesnt matter what language you know as long as you know enough to bring a full working web app to fruition.<p>I would love to talk to anyone interested and feel free to send me an email  blyandvert@gmail.com.<p>Lets build something amazing together.",1325863232

A lawyer can claim to be an engineer, after all. However I think it is clear that if we actually did the experiment, it would be much more likely than 30% that Jack is an engineer. A way of testing what you really believe the probability to be is this: I bet you a dollar that Jack is an engineer. If you wouldn't, that means that you really believe the probability to be larger than 50%.<p>This is because the probability that he answers yes to the question is much higher when he is in fact an engineer than when he is a lawyer. Bayes' law says:<p><pre><code>    P(E|Y) = P(E) * P(Y|E)/P(Y)\n</code></pre>\nYou should read P(A|B) as ""the probability that A is true given that B is true"". In this case E = ""a person is an engineer"" and Y = ""a person answers yes to the question 'are you an engineer?'"". As you can see the original P(E) = 30% gets multiplied by P(Y|E)/P(Y) given the information that the person answered yes. The probability that a person answers yes given that he is an engineer is higher than the general probability that a person answers yes. So P(Y|E)/P(Y) > 1. So P(E|Y) > 30%.<p>This same law applies to other characteristics, for example Y = ""person likes mathematics"".",1325862717

Instead of finding ways to pressure the Iranian government we are hurting the Iranian people.  The sanctions we place on Iran hurts the Iranian people and their small businesses much more than the Iranian government and it's abundant(for now) oil resource.<p>Obama really tried at first to bring in a different approach.  First off he understood the structure  of power in Iran and so wrote a letter to Khamenei directly.  Then he tried to talk to the Iranian people in parallel by sending the message for Norooz (Iranian New Year).  Next he offered to sit and talk with the Iranians without any preconditions, but what messed everything up for him was the Iranian elections.  That was (read: is) a big pile of mess that no one really knew (read: knows) how to deal with.",1325862267

Then he/she learns two new postures over a period of two months and adds that to their usual routine, and this iterates.<p>So, in about two years the person should be in good physical shape. That is how Yoga should be done.\nI'd recommend an immensely useful book on Hatha Yoga, but I can't find the link.

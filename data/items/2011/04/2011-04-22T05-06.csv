How can that be? Simple, unless an idea is coupled with execution its value is zero. This is what leads to the phrase 'ideas are worthless' which is misleading IMO when phrased that way.<p>> why arent the millions of developers constantly outdoing themselves with utterly amazing work<p>That statement is flawed on many levels. First, the percentage of the population with a high level understanding of technology is small, and the percentage of those who are developers is smaller, and the percentage of those that are great developers is smaller still. So saying ""the millions of developers"" like there really are that many working directly on tech innovation in Silicon Valley and elsewhere in the US is questionable at best.<p>Now, if you're asking why don't the ""great"" proportion of developers do amazing work the answer is that they do. They are the reason you can view and post on Hacker News with a working OS, or listen to thousands of songs on a device as small as your hand, and on that same device check email, play games, download thousands of apps, and make phone calls, etc. In other words, great developers are <i>busy</i> building things. Many amazing things. Some developers build things for companies, and some venture out on their own to build new and innovative things like Twitter, Groupon, or Facebook, some of which work and many which don't. But there certainly are <i>many</i> amazing pieces of technology that have been built so far, and there are many more to come... These won't all come at the same time, but the tinkerers are out there... building, trying, failing, and trying again. They are doing the hard work of executing, and for a small fraction of them, it will pay off.<p>Edit: Let me put the idea challenge back on you, phlux. If your belief is ""idea"" people are certainly only held back from their $ millions in success by not being developers, why don't they borrow, sell, or mortgage $50K on their house etc. and just get the idea built and cash in? It's that easy, right?",1303450283

Both can only mostly be metabolized in the liver, whereas glucose can be metabolized throughout the body.  Both result in a storage as fat of a significant portion of the calories, possibly in the liver, where the fat causes long-term harm.  Most of glucose on the other hand is stored in the liver as glycogen, which is not harmful long-term, and is the main source when you're eating a bunch of white pasta (glucose) storing up for a big race.<p>- If we just ate fructose from fruits we'd eat 10-20% as much as we do today.  Plus fiber is protective against many of the negative effects associated with fructose.  So fruit is probably on the balance still good for you or neutral in terms of the negative effects from fructose mentioned here.<p>- Fructose seems to suppress the post-eating dip in ghrelin levels, where ghrelin is thought to be important in encouraging us to eat--the ""hunger hormone"".<p>- Fructose doesn't cause a spike in insulin and reduces leptin, which he views as a negative, as it goes along with not discouraging further eating.<p>- He gave no evidence that glucose is good or beneficial, or reasons why glucose isn't a threat to increased risk of diabetes, etc.  He's just chosen his battle as against fructose, as it's more winnable than against all sugar.<p>That last bullet is my conclusion/wrapup of his perspective.  I think his points are valid, and his recommendations are good for an overweight person (ie, your average American), but he oversimplifies things to make his case simpler and stronger.  If you're really trying to stay healthy, eating a ton of glucose is not a good thing--an issue he mainly skirts to keep the focus on fructose.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM</a>",1303448736

Just because you live in a linux bubble, doesn't mean there isn't a world outside of that bubble.  Almost all software that runs on linux isn't using the linux api, they are using a gradually munged up collection of APIs from over the years, including posix, bsd and sysv APIs.  That software works on on dozens of different systems.  Software written to a common API that is implemented by dozens of different systems seems a lot more like an argument in favour of more rendering engines implementing a common API.",1360774681

It's a great way to have a peer reviewed and curated set of high quality examples to learn from.<p>At the same time, I do agree with many of the points in Tammer's article. I think the danger with Rails templates, scaffolding and even Daniel's work is that it's very easy to take it and use it part and parcel without understanding what's really going on inside, and why certain decisions were made (this gem vs. that gem, or this code technique vs. that). I think there's a lot of value in starting from scratch (Daniel's option #1) and adding things step by step. As Tammer pointed out, this can lead to a positive team discussion and learning dynamic. And I don't mind the extra typing and time required.<p>The next time I start a new Rails app, I'll probably:\n- Look for a good example to learn from in RailsApps or elsewhere.\n- But then step back to ""rails new"" and add in the recommended gems bit by bit, with testing along the way.\n- Hopefully contribute back to RailsApp if I learn anything new :)",1360774649

But I can rest assure you.. that you are privileged..<p>I am a hispanic male working as a computer programmer, and maybe because of that it's easier to see the privilege my occupation affords me as my grandmother lives in a country where the median income after tax is 500 american.. Where every so often the police, and army decide to shoot it out in the streets.. Where 51% of the population is beneath the poverty line..<p>Maybe it's easier for me to see privilege as I went to a highschool that was a minority majority school in the poor part of town. Where some kids weren't worried about there health care from the flu, but there health care from a flying bullets within there apartment complex. Where the kids in the cafeteria line that had white slips are getting there only meal of the day because it's paid for by the government.<p>Not only do I think it's important to understand we are privileged; I believe it is also our responsibility to act on that privilege to make sure all are granted the same basics our life affords as engineers (job security, food, health care, personal security[violence], time off to vote, etc). Only when the general public is granted those basics will I even partially not think of my self as not privileged.",1360774612
5214138,comment,5213464,5213464,4,0,mfonda,,,"This is a really great development for PHP. A bit more background on this for those not familiar with Zend Optimizer+ and PHP. Zend Optimizer+ is an opcode cache, and using an opcode cache greatly improves the performance of PHP. The improvement is so significant, that it's generally not practical to run PHP without using an opcode cache.<p>Despite an opcode cache generally being necessary to use PHP at scale, one has never been included in the core distribution. There has often been discussion about including APC (another opcode cache) in the core. A suggestion [1] to ship APC with PHP 5.5 was proposed recently, and after some discussion, an alternative was proposed [2]: Zend would open source Zend Optimizer+, and it would be included in PHP 5.5.<p>No definite decision has been made yet on whether Zend Optimizer+ will make it into 5.5 (or the next release), but the consensus so far seems to be that it will.

If you rip out the cat conv you can never run gasoline again.  Fundamentally the flame burns too hot/fast creating nitrogen oxides.

Propane is even better.<p>If you absolutely positively ""must"" use H2 for marketing reasons or whatever then pipe it into a fuel cell and top off a battery, either pure elec or hybrid ICE.<p>The biggest problem is H2 solely commercially comes from natgas, and it turns out that natgas is a great automotive fuel with a huge (mostly non-US) deployed base.  So there is no practical advantage in turning natgas into H2 and then inventing a whole new infrastructure for H2 distribution and all new vehicles, when there's already an excellent system for natgas.<p>The fundamental problem of H2 is how do you intermediate yourself if you're not wanted, not needed, and add no value?

Palm's ""heyday"" was the late 1990s through the early 2000s.  Computers were already extremely ubiquitous at that time.

Palm's PDAs were very much still a niche market when smartphones came along and made them irrelevant.  In 2003-2004, PDAs (across all brands) sold about 2.6 million units[1].  This was probably the peak, but I can't confirm that.  Three years later the iPhone launched and Apple sold 6.1 million units of the 1st generation[2].  Just last <i>quarter</i> they sold 47.8 million iPhones[3].<p>> <i>It's a clear case of revisionist history to say that the iPhone is the ""first comprehensively successful attempt to create a mass-market, consumer-friendly, always-on, pocketable touch screen computer"".</i><p>No, it's clear that the iPhone's sales absolutely dwarf those of Palm.  Relatively speaking, Palm was not a ""successful attempt to create a mass-market ... touch screen computer"".

Sure, modern JITing js-engines are  arguably the most technically advanced parts of a modern browser. However they are relatively small and self-contained; a suitably (i.e crazy-) talented team of engineers can get ballpark comparable performance of V8/Spidermonkey/etc. in a surprisingly short amount of time.<p>Most of the difficulty of making a browser fast is chasing the bottlenecks across multiple layers. For example it's no use having a super-fast javascript engine if your DOM implementation is so slow that real sites always bottleneck there. And there's no point in having fast DOM if your style layer is too slow to relayout when the underlying tree changes. And having a fast style layer doesn't help you much if your final compositing and painting are holding everything back. And of course different sites have radically different behaviour and what is an optimisation for one case might slow down a different case.",1360773720

That's what a sale is, and that's what a sale should be.<p>An earn-out represents value that <i>is yet to be created</i> -- the future interaction between your business and the acquirer's business.  There's nothing wrong with that inherently, but recognize that it's really just an incentive for what is to come, not payment for what was done.<p>Now, none of this is saying that you shouldn't accept a deal with an earn-out if that's what you've got in front of you.  But you have to think about it differently --<p>If you built a business that you think is worth $100M and you sell it to BigCo for $100M, 50% of which is structured as an earn-out given revenue targets over 3 years - guess what....you didn't actually sell your business for $100M.<p>You sold your business for $50M and agreed to a $50M compensation package in your new job.  And with that new job comes the uncertainty of what your new owners will do.  They could, conceivably, decide to close your division and lay everyone off after 6 months - having absolutely nothing to do with you or your team (this happens in big companies).<p>So when the time comes, just make sure you have the right perspective about what price you're actually selling your company for.",1360773318

He'll tell you ""el cafe de Colombia compi!"" Now, ask a Haitian the same question. He'll have the same answer, but he'll also insist that you try Haitian coffee and decide for yourself.<p>Every coffee producing nation take pride in their coffee, but no nation is prouder about their coffee than Haitians.<p>The name ""Kafe Pa Nou"" meaning ""Our Coffee"", and also ""Our Favorite Coffee"", stems from this pride that haitians have towards their coffee.<p>We strongly stand by the belief that Haitian farmers grow the best coffee in the world, but we won't force it onto you. Instead, we'll invite you to try our coffee. After all, coffee is one of these things that you should ""Have it Your Way"". There are so many ways to brew and spice up your coffee, that the resulting number of taste is infinite. Some people prefer the French press over the Ibrik, or the Regular Drip. We haitians have an affinity for the Stove Top Espresso.<p>As a haitian company, we strive to reflect the true nature of the Haitian People: Hospitable, Authentic and Warm.<p>So when we say ""we'll invite you to try our coffee"", we mean that we'll send you some of our coffee free of charge if you've never tried it. Just send us a kind email at tryourcoffee@kafepanou.com with your name, address, a few words about yourself, and your very own share of haitian coffee will be on its way.<p>As a haitian, I'll proudly say it again and again: We have some of the finest strains of coffee in the world.

Although, if there were small changes between the book and the thesis, the author was probably within her rights to email (and indeed host online) the thesis for free.",1360772828

5213890,comment,5213338,5213338,26,0,elptacek,,,"So I am glad to not be the first comment on this post, because I almost was. Instead, I took a while to compose my thoughts and I'm going to take a whack at writing them down. To start, I just deactivated my facebook account to get away from exactly this type of rhetoric. Why? When I look back over my career, it is striking that I have received no career enrichment from any of my female peers or co-workers. Absolutely none. All of the help I've ever gotten has come from men. Do I take a dump on that kindness by punishing them for another person's bad behavior, or by assuming these guys only wanted to get into my pants? I can't live like that.<p>A few years ago, I was pulling into my garage and because of whatever circumstance I have forgotten, my mind was grinding on the idea of prejudice. Specifically how the act of judging another person consumes resources in my mind that I am hesitant to commit, as I'd very much like to use as much of my mind as I can coordinate for more interesting things. This sounds arrogant, but I'm fine with that label and so let's move on. The way I think is the product of constantly having to not take on other people's drama in order to raise my standard of living. That's not the most elegant way of saying what I mean to say, but I'm a bit frustrated right now. The habit of not engaging makes me acutely aware that when I do engage, it is important to choose one's words carefully. I rarely get that right.<p>This is a blatant attempt to engage other people in a negative way. I fail to see the benefits such finger-pointing, but I am willing to learn that there might be some. It seems that if there were no perceived benefit to the actor for the act, but from here it just looks like fighting fire with fire.<p>As a woman in technology, I've seen some things. Mostly I just let it go. I don't think of it as having a thick skin (anyone who knows me will tell you, this is not a character attribute of mine). Rather I think of it as not letting other people's drama own any part of me. And that is what I think when anyone complains of anything, be it gender bias or racial bias or religious/political disagreement: nothing can own you unless you let it.  Maybe this is what having a thick skin is supposed to mean. As I have said to my kids countless times, your anger hurts you the most. I can't find a clear source for this quote, but it goes something like, ""Holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.""<p>This is not how you teach kids to deal with bullies.",1360772609

The argument (as you suggest) seems to go in one direction only - why aren't there more female (developers|CEOs|politicians)?<p>The problems are more complex:<p>1) One problem is related to the fact that society <i>values</i> male roles more than female. A traditional skilled ""female"" role earns considerably less than a similarly qualified ""male"" role. While this isn't immediately relevant to the current conversation, it crops up along with the ""glass ceiling"" argument about CEOs and other high-status traditionally male roles.<p>2) Another, and the one typified in the OP, is the mockery or prejudice that applies <i>from men</i> to those who take jobs in roles more typical of the opposite gender. You know the jokes about male hairdressers, and male nurses also have to overcome such jokes. The <i>jokes</i> that females in typically male roles have to overcome are similarly well known, and even less palatable.<p>Personally, I don't care about gender balance, numerically at least: I don't think the world needs more male nurses or hairdressers, or female developers or construction workers (more power to them if they want to do it though). I <i>do</i> think the world needs to accept (without orthogonal prejudice) when <i>they</i> make the choice and try as hard as I did when I started out in this career.",1360772400

The whole point is to push the probability of infection further along the tail end of the curve. Good computing habits won't help you in such cases. It doesn't matter if 99.9% of careful users relying on Windows Defender report having no trouble with malware for X amount of time (with X being large here) - the point is to ensure that you don't fall victim to edge cases, since only a single successful attack can cost you dearly.<p>Also, those who write malware for Windows 8 will certainly interact with Windows Defender and the smart coders will make sure that their 'product' can defeat it, if only imperfectly at first. It's much harder for them to target several different antimalware solutions.<p>These are obviously 'at a distance' considerations made without going into any Win8 specifics, but as a long time Windows 8 user (if there is such a thing), I can say that Windows Defender has unexpectedly stopped working or failed to update on several occasions. This doesn't exactly inspire confidence, so I chose to rely on a 3rd party solution. The bottom line is to use your own judgement and (as always) to at least consider sensible contrarian options.<p>(Note: I'm not a specialist in this, so I can't say how effective Windows Defender is in combating malware (not least because AFAIK you can't run Windows Defender alongside some 3rd party solution.))",1360772391

There is an enormous difference.<p>Just like all previous bilateral ""free trade"" agreements between the US and any sovereign state, the US will not play fairly and the amount of actual trade tariff reductions and trade promotion in it will pale in comparison to US demands on cross-regional rights, privileges for trans-national corporations and the US state, and even internal regulation changes for the other on key issues of enormous importance to the US.<p>At this time those key issues for the US are:<p>1. <i>Intellectual Property normalization</i>. Particularly, on software patents, digital sharing, cross-regional copyright and licensing, generic medicines, grey market imports, etc.<p>2. <i>Agricultural Products normalization</i>, especially Genetically-Modified crops and artificial hormone meat products.<p>3. <i>Human Rights normalization and deferral removal</i>, i.e. reduction of the impact of human rights legislation, particularly European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) on any aspect of (bilateral) trade, including ""privacy"" rights.<p>So, why now? The problem is while the EU single market is functioning better than ever (otherwise why would the US be interested), the core members who are also part of the broken Eurozone, are still reeling from the impact of the 2008 financial crisis and the associated sovereign debt crisis.<p>This gives significant leverage for the US, who have largely paid down the upfront cost of the financial crises, certainly at least all their banks are fully recapitalized or resolved, unlike the EU.<p>There may be additional leverage from the European people themselves who are strongly feeling the impact of the economic crises, and more importantly from the European national parliament politicians plus media, since this gives them a type of ""deus ex machina"" to support, when in reality all real and most difficult change has to start internally.<p>So, yes, it would be ""<i>huge</i>"" - for the US...",1360771921

I say that with complete empathy, because I have done the same thing, had long internal debates with myself about which stereotypes I want strangers to associate with me.<p>But being accurate about your job description isn't really what someone wants to know when they ask that question, is it?  They're really looking for information about you, not your job.  Your job title comes with a guess at a range of how much money you make, and what kind of activities you spend your time doing.  Nobody really cares if your math is industrial or not.  If you do a lot of math while you work, its entirely reasonable to say you're a mathematician.  And since nobody knows what an industrial mathematician is, all they're going to hear is 'mathematician' anyway.  :)<p>It doesn't help to promote poor stereotypes either, but Adam does it anyway.  Its understandable and we all do it, but it sure would be better to fight the negative images than reinforce them.<p>""Today, they [mathematicians] produce papers for publication""<p>Here Adam is talking about math professors.  Academics.  A mathematician, on the other hand, is anyone who does math.  Adam is a mathematician.<p>""People who design new technologies are engineers.""<p>Not bad, but I like wikipedia's definition beter: An engineer is a professional practitioner of engineering, concerned with applying scientific knowledge, mathematics and ingenuity to develop solutions for technical problems.  Adam is an engineer.<p>Re: analysts, he begins: ""Working with pencil and paper...""<p>This just in, <i>nobody</i> except for sketch artists work with pencils anymore, and even most of them are on the computer.  Analysts spend their time analyzing, and Adam spent multiple paragraphs describing his brand of analysis.<p>A programmer is a ""person who carries out the specific instructions of an engineer"".<p>Wow.  How many of you does that apply to?  Generally, the programmer is the engineer, no?  I can't say I've ever met a programmer that definition would apply to, I can't think of one who ever took his technical direction from an ""engineer"".<p>""The programmer is carrying out the vision of another while my software is written to support my own vision.""<p>That seems just a little exaggerated to me, since he works for a company just like the rest of us.  And lest we forget the millions of programmers releasing their wares open source, or places like the Android or Apple app stores.  Those are the people truly writing software to support their own vision.<p>""The computer scientist seeks a holy grail of computing.""<p>I agree with this one, and I agree with Adam that he's not one.  :)  But, very few people who call themselves computer scientists are actually computer scientists.  Most of them are programmers.  Or engineers, if you like.<p>Consultants are ""costly parasites in American business.""<p>That might be true, but if you are a temporary or contract hire, or the result of your time is advice to a company, then you actually are a consultant.<p>Ultimately, using a categorical term is necessary when describing what you do to someone else.

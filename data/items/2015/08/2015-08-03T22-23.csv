Without even providing a call to action I might add...<p>If you really want to point fingers for her specific complaint, point them at the marketing team. It&#x27;s 2015 and every tech creeper out there has a mobile phone to play on while bored at bart. Her first and last name and workplace are listed - why would they go to onelogin.com/careers (again, with no call to action even - what&#x27;s in it for them?) when they could just as easily look her up on LinkedIn and try to find some more pics and send an inmessage. And yes, as another woman in tech, I can personally attest that there are TONS of tech creepers out there. NO, I don&#x27;t think that is how it should be, but I also think that the marketing team should have tried harder to protect their own employees. They should have taken in to account that creepers are there and WILL be exposed to this bart take over campaign. Doesn&#x27;t sound like a well thought out or strategic campaign.<p>side note on the dice campaign - big difference here. Those are models. They got paid to pose for the billboards. The Dice marketing team didn&#x27;t make it easy for tech creepers to find them online to harass them (no last name, no company listed, no identifying features besides the focus of the campaign message - which, btw, actually has a call to action... just saying). Not a fair comparison.<p>My 2 cents on sexism in tech as a whole - I agree it is a TOTALLY unfair world right now. I battle this in all parts of my work life. Personally have experienced unfair pay, demeaning &quot;compliments&quot;, the comments about &quot;being too pretty to know about [fill in the tech subject]&quot;. The feeling that I have to wear a fake wedding ring at events to cut harassment down. Being talked down to because I am young and blonde, how &quot;cute&quot;. That is a lot of bullshit to be up against! Yeah, it&#x27;s terrible, and it isn&#x27;t right.<p>But I can say that it IS IMPROVING. I see an increased amount of women when I am at industry events or visiting other offices. Could it be better? Hell yes. Keep your head up ladies and don&#x27;t take the bullshit - which includes being smart about what you participate in and stand up for. When something negative (like this woman&#x27;s experience being in this campaign) happens to you, LEARN from it and don&#x27;t let yourself be in that position anymore. Be there for your sisters and girlfriends. Empower each other. It is terrifying, but also liberating. Find where you rock it the hardest and hustle that shit til you get what you want and nobody can deny it from you. If you find yourself in a place where you&#x27;re being harassed, gtfo and go somewhere better. Be the example and support others, otherwise nothing will ever change.",1438642183

Grants are a pain to apply for (there&#x27;s a reason that full-time grant-writers exist) and the feedback loop is very slow. Compare that to the VC world, where you can quite easily raise a small amount of seed/pre-seed capital quickly, and even when you&#x27;re rejected, you&#x27;re likely to hear back quickly[0].<p>This will be a challenge for YC, because it inherently creates an adverse selection problem. The companies that YC (and all venture funds) want to attract the most are the ones who <i>could</i> win a grant if they applied, not the ones who are seeking venture funding simply because they can&#x27;t actually survive the grant process[1]. The grant application process is terrible for a lot of reasons, but it does have the side-effect of filtering out a lot of people who simply aren&#x27;t that serious or invested in their work. For YC, it means a lot more companies to sift through to identify the gems.<p>There are certainly some billion-dollar companies that could not survive the grant process (or simply would prefer not to go through it), but if we&#x27;re looking strictly at the ratios, it&#x27;s going to be a lot more challenging for any venture fund to find these &#x27;needles&#x27;, because the &#x27;haystack&#x27; is simply much larger (relatively speaking).<p>[0] If you never hear back from a VC, that means you&#x27;re probably either rejected or being punted on (&quot;not now, but maybe later&quot;). But that&#x27;s a good thing - at least you know! If you don&#x27;t hear back from a grant application after 2 months, that doesn&#x27;t actually mean anything other than your application may not have been reviewed yet.<p>[1] Possible reasons for failing to win grants: project/business model is simply not valuable, project is not well fleshed-out, company does not have the runway to survive the drawn-out application cycle, etc. All of these apply to the venture world as well, but the cycle there is much faster.",1438641419

  2. Find someone willing to help you for cheaper and/or free
  3. Sleep at a more expensive place

Walmart&#x27;s mobile apps are highly rated and the services we write to support them are the base of that success. We started from a small company acquisition with a single product. Today, we power a platform and a suite of products running on mobile devices and systems in retail stores.<p>We&#x27;re still a small, flat team of engineers. We work with our own tools and make our own build-or-borrow decisions. Our culture is a healthy mix of sharing and pushing each other to be better at our craft. For example, we use pull requests & code reviews liberally. We make refactoring time. We deploy often, with a single line of code run from a REPL. Engineers on our team are challenged to work through our full software stack and be part of our product management. We believe that people are more engaged, fulfilled and happy when they feel responsible for actually shipping their work.<p>The environment at WalmartLabs balances moving fast and breaking shit, with the knowledge that we could break shit for 150+ million people every week. It&#x27;s a tough balance but we&#x27;ve found the payoff to be worth the challenge and responsibility.<p>Some aspects of our work that are important to us:<p><pre><code>  - high performance distributed systems
  - robust & well-factored codebases
  - simple & fast deployments
  - automating the hell out of operations
  - thorough system test coverage
  - managing our own development process and work backlog
  - pair programming when it makes sense (locally and remotely)
  - contributing back to the clojure & open source community
</code></pre>
What we do:<p><pre><code>  - write all our production systems & tools in Clojure
  - create and orchestrate massive distributed systems
  - spin up RESTful web services for consuming & ingesting large volumes of data

But I didn&#x27;t always eat the way I should, and while I&#x27;ve been a competitive athlete on an &quot;on again, off again&quot; basis throughout my adult life (wrestling, jiu-jitsu, powerlifting, mountain biking, etc.), I had been too much of the &quot;off again&quot; for the past few years, and had let my weight creep up a bit.  Even then though, it took me by surprise, I wasn&#x27;t exactly one of those 350lb super-obese people you look at and think &quot;how is that guy not dead yet&quot;, ya know?  But between that and the stress I was under, it almost did me in.<p>And just to elaborate on all this a bit... I&#x27;d always heard the old saw &quot;stress kills&quot;, but interestingly enough, after the heart attack, something <i>everybody</i> (cardiologist, GP, nurses, cardiac rehab people, etc.) emphasized to me VERY strongly, was the impact of stress. I&#x27;m sure I heard &quot;you need to lower your stress levels&quot; more than I heard &quot;you need to lose weight&quot; or &quot;you need to lower your cholesterol&quot;.   And I was <i>really</i> grinding those last few months right before it happened.  I was working pretty much 7 days a week, and I&#x27;d routinely put in 8 hours during the day, then go up to B&N or Starbucks and work another 5 or 6 hours, during which time I&#x27;d drink a triple-shot latte, drink a Red Bull, and then eat a box or two of chocolate covered espresso beans.  And I&#x27;d do this shit 4 or 5 times a week.  In hindsight, it was all pretty stupid, but, like almost everybody who <i>hasn&#x27;t</i> had a brush with death, I thought I was superhuman and could push myself that hard and get away with it.<p>So, again, moral of this story: DO NOT DO WHAT I DID. I AM A BAD EXAMPLE.<p>Take some time off, unwind, do something outdoors (hiking, biking, running, swimming, whatever), eat a healthful diet, and talk to your doctor occasionally.  I know there&#x27;s a lot of backlash against &quot;over testing&quot; and all, but at the very least, it&#x27;s probably a good idea to go have an annual physical.   Stop smoking if you do.  Heart attacks are largely avoidable, but it means doing things right.",1438639758

The UI positions are heavily focused on Angular.js and Bootstrap. QA leans Python.

If we think you look good on paper, we’ll reach out for a phone chat and give you the details on a pretty open-ended code test, where you’ll implement a simple library. If we like your solution, then we’ll invite you for a live culture fit and technical interview, in-person if you’re near or remote if not.

The end result is that economist can make statements that are technically true but that end up conveying a completely different message when listened by a lay person.<p>In this case, when an economist talks about &quot;productivity&quot;, it has a very specific concept in mind. One that has more to do with ROI than with the manufacturing of any thing of value at all. Of course, both concepts are not completely detached from each other (it would be useless to grab a concept to mean something random instead), but they are not 100% aligned either, and this results in misunderstanding, if not actual misleading. By example, when some troubled company talks about &quot;increasing employee productivity&quot;, naive employees expect some sort of training program to help them be more effective at their jobs. What they get is a pink slip instead; if productivity is ROI, you can lay off half of your people and use the company&#x27;s momentum to keep turning 80% of the income, so on paper it will look like you are having better ROI (even if the cuts get too deep and are damaging the long term viability of the business).",1438639247

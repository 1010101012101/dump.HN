I lived in a city of 150,000, where my beautiful 4300+sqft/400m^2 home in a very nice neighborhood with manicured lawns, a playground, neighborhood pool, and 2mi/3.2km of wooded walking paths can be had for ~$600,000.  In the majority of the country, that&#x27;s a high end luxury home price.  In the Bay Area, it&#x27;s a hovel price but -- even if you could find a house like it, which is very hard -- would be a $4m house on a postage stamp lot in a cramped neighborhood.<p>I <i>know</i> it&#x27;s impractical to build neighborhoods and homes like that in a place like the peninsula, but I would be lying if I said I didn&#x27;t miss it... a lot.  If you can&#x27;t afford to live near work out here, and if you don&#x27;t rent in an actual urban center, by the time you get home in the evenings the traffic has drained you so much it&#x27;s hard to be motivated to do anything besides eat & sleep, rinse * repeat.<p>To your point, if you transplanted some of the nicer neighborhoods in Palo Alto or Menlo Park, for example, almost anywhere else in the country, and they&#x27;d just be slightly run down, mostly mediocre neighborhoods most middle/upper class folks would pass up in favor of new construction.

Consider the following link.<p><a href=""http://freemars.org/l5/aboutl5.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freemars.org/l5/aboutl5.html</a><p>Just intuitively - think about the rockets you need to get a satellite level payload to geosynchronous orbit vs what it took to get space probes to lunar orbit (let alone exolunar or returning a craft to earth).  Bear in mind that staging is an exponential problem, the more mass and the more total delta-V you need, the problem gets exponentially worse.  Small satellites can be launched what amounts to a SRBM and a small kicker, to get even a small probe to lunar orbit you need an ICBM plus a pretty decent kicker to handle translunar injection and lunar orbiting.  To get a spacecraft there you need, well, a Saturn-V plus a decent kicker plus a small rocket for everything else.<p>Geosynchronous satellites started in 1963 (Syncom 1) but the Lunar Orbiter program didn&#x27;t start until 1965.  That doesn&#x27;t make sense if geosynchronous orbit was beyond lunar orbit.  And if geosynchronous orbit was an equal distance, it would be trivial to put satellites into trailing orbits and cover the lunar blind spot.  Lagrange points are a different (but very useful) orbital equilibrium.  Particularly the Sun-Earth LaGrange points - these are indeed very far from Earth and have a very useful vantage point for all sorts of things.

It&#x27;s the fine art of not giving a shit because you&#x27;re going to get paid anyways.<p>&quot;Oh these poor .NET bastards, they&#x27;re just sooo clueless of the world around them; they only know Windows.&quot; I&#x27;m sure this could be said of just about anyone. All tech stacks have their stars and fry cooks. As with many things, it&#x27;s a matter of how you want to dedicate your time. Could I spend my time focused on file system design, memory issues, and network architectures. Absolutely! It&#x27;s great that people enjoy this stuff; I personally don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s boring to me same reason I don&#x27;t enjoy futzing around with Linux. I don&#x27;t care about how it works; just that it does work. When I write for the .NET/C# stack, my focus is on the business problem. How do I impact the end-user (ie Shannon over in accounting, or little Timmy dipshit in Iowa) in a positive way.<p>&quot;VS also has this really nasty habit of creating &quot;csproj&quot; and &quot;sln&quot; files. I hate those things.&quot; this is like bitching about make files. It&#x27;s beyond silly. Could it be improved- probably, does it need to be- no. I think make files are a horrible way to do things, do I bitch about it- no. I understand that that is the preferred approach of the environment. Learn what I need to do to make it work and get on with my day. And really, these types of complaints are just childish. You&#x27;re a professional. Deal with it.<p>As far as IIS is concerned, we can have a ceremonial burning of the source code one day. That product is beyond useless.<p>The selling point of C#/.NET isn&#x27;t it&#x27;s community- it&#x27;s its productivity. A company can hire a small team of developers and they can crank out a bunch of code in short order to solve some specific problem. The code will be written the &quot;.NET way&quot; not because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s best for performance, but because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s best for development. Same thing happens in other technology stacks. Code is written to follow a well followed pattern by its community so that new hires and other developers can quickly suss out what&#x27;s going on without having to stop and think. It&#x27;s the same song and dance of using third-party libraries. Bit like a royale with cheese instead of a big-mac. Dress it up different, but the same principles are at play.<p>Fundamentally, there&#x27;s going to be some cultural exchange between the traditional .NET crowd and the open source crowd. Both parties stand to learn a lot from one another, and have lots of opportunities to discover overlap. Rather than throwing in the towel and saying .NET is bullshit and used by dullards who solve inconsequential problems is short sighted. Find a place for .NET in your stack, look for opportunities to mix it in with your existing open source technologies. If you can&#x27;t find a spot for it, then move on to whatever works for you. It&#x27;s not rocket science.",1444788439

Bonus points for a nice salad and other simple options.<p>With groups, when food is appropriate, the food often determines a lot of their potential to enjoy the event and may frequently enhance value perception.<p>My best success with this is centered on local places that deliver kick ass catering.  Even simple things, sandwiches, pizza, salad, cheeze, etc... can be really great treats.<p>It&#x27;s all in the preparation and presentation.  Compare a chain pizza to oven fired, olive oil infused, pizza with fresh, high grade ingredients.  It&#x27;s like night and day, and the difference in cost isn&#x27;t s big deal given the value added.<p>Finding these places can be a fun networking task, and a meet n greet to sample makes great sense too.  Get to know a few and be rewarded with great food experiences with low to no hassle.<p>Time and place matter too.  Can it be an evening affair with light drinks?  Knowing the user community matters as much as anything else does.  Finding ways to message, educate, and encourage everyone to network and share experiences is worth the extra effort.<p>I think about whether I look forward to the event, or it being work.  It is work in both cases, but having a good time and looking forward to that reward of good eats, friends, and high value information is almost not work.<p>Target that experience.  You will pay a bit more, and you will work a bit more, but everyone involved gets enough to make it all worth it and they will be more inclined to bring others too.<p>For a number of years, I was part of a large, regional product user group.  Helped organize the event, and I was a part of many technical things related to the community.  I almost never had trouble presenting material, getting others to speak, etc...  we served brown bag lunches in an auditorium, and over the years it got to be almost a family event.  Repeat attendees had named bags with just the right stuff in there for them, and we always ordered a little extra for new people.  Many were considerate and would give names and food preferences too.<p>Cost was something like $8 per, and the business generated as well as the closeness of the community really was something.  Many of those people have kept in touch and have brought new opportunity and contacts long after that successful run.<p>A bulk catering would have been less.  Maybe half.<p>I am sure we would not have has the same long term, resonant effects with a lesser venue and more general food.  Worth every penny.<p>A similar meetup for creative worked best in a local tech building with beer and wine.<p>Both groups, with the former being engineering focused, responded to personal treatment in favorable ways: being positive advocates, referrals, presenters, friends, etc...  while needing very different vibes and atmosphere to maximize it for them.<p>Some time spent really understanding this will almost always pay big dividends.<p>I understand some groups won&#x27;t have the same value potential, but I also suspect the positive impact on staff and alphas in the community will still make details matter.  No matter what, the staff and significant contributors are going to be there and a lot of how they present and the value perception on all of that is very likely worth some effort.<p>Unless the business is running ultra lean for necessary reasons, damn good events are worth more than more events in my experience.",1444788314

It&#x27;s probably a case of &quot;we&#x27;re sending a probe, would you like to put a telescope on it or have nothing at all&quot;.  I edited that I mean geosynchronous <i>lunar</i> orbit in particular.<p>If the target is in the plane of the ecliptic then the period of observation is probably not a full 28 days - for roughly half of that period a target would be eclipsed by the moon, plus some change for the Earth.  I have no idea the precise time this would be better or worse than the Earth given the Moon&#x27;s lack of magnetosphere or atmosphere pushing the drag down and decreasing the orbital radius vs the smaller angular view of the moon and so on.  It&#x27;s still probably longer than the Earth&#x27;s when comparing the radii equivalently, I&#x27;d think.  It&#x27;s 28x and change for sure, but with significant confounding factors.<p>Counterpoint:  the Moon has near-trivial gravity, so getting to lunar orbit isn&#x27;t much of a problem.  <i>Assuming</i> we had a moonbase, we could service lunar-orbital telescopes very easily.  Remember, lunar orbit was attained by the Apollo LEM, compared to a S-V to get off the terrestrial surface.  The rocket equation is a bitch, and strong gravity wells suck ass.",1444788300

353320,comment,353264,353264,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"Probably too much (in that the expected utility of reading more books significantly drops off after a certain point).\nI own way too many books.  about 1/3rd literature and non-fiction and 2/3rds science fiction.  I can't bear to part with the really good ones.  But the problem is that at 4-8 books a month my collection grows on average 50-60 books a year.  Since i started when i was 8 or 9 I'm up to about 600 books (a couple reductions here and there) that i don't want to get rid of.  this is a hassle for moving and for space planning.<p>But it is worth it.  Science fiction authors and computer scientists (lots of overlap there) seem to be only people on Earth that have zero respect for bullshit.  Ideologically, those are the people who raised me.  One of the ways in which I've been very lucky is that I have pursued very few blind alleys compared to most people.  I can go back to the material I consumed at a young age and not shake my head in disapproval at my younger self as many other people seem to do.  My life has largely been a continuous iterative process of ever better approximations of reality with no restarts (so far, i might still decide to live in the mountains and contemplate the pebble).",1225799956

Generally, I read philosophy and theology (my undergraduate degree is in philosophy), though most recently I've been picking up some of the collections of essays my wife is reading for her graduate work.  I'm also a huge fan of anything about the history of Pittsburgh.<p>Current reading list:\n<i>Christianity and Anarchy</i> Jacques Ellul\n<i>The Gulag Archipelago</i> Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\n<i>Third Ways</i> Allan Carlson<p>My reading time seems to come in fits.  Some days I won't pick up a book, and others I'll read for several hours.

353306,comment,353264,353264,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I love books and reading, although I'm finding as I get older I'm much more willing to ""bail out"" of a book. I also find myself in multiple books. Quite honestly I think this is due to a decreasing attention span.<p>I think there are two types of reading. The first type is conversational or fun reading. It's like having a dialog with the author. The second is structured reading, where the goal is information transfer at the expense of readability. It's great when you can get a book that does both, but the trick is to be able to make yourself read the second type when the information is worth getting.<p>So the books I have open right now are ""Expert F#"", ""Getting past Ok"" (recommended by another HN'er). ""Practical ML"", and ""When Genius Failed""<p>I'm also watching a series of college lectures on the history and evolution of spoken language -- very interesting!<p>I read 2-4 books a month. It's definitely worth it to me. Many times consulting is just being able to consume and process information that most people don't have time for. That means a lot of reading. So while everybody else is watching football or dancing with the stars, I'm either working on startup stuff or learning.",1225798346

353299,comment,353264,353264,0,0,petercooper,,,"I'm a book collector, if that counts! Some months I only buy a few books, some months I will buy 30. Very few are technical. Most are non-fictional on topics such as marketing, PR, design, information theory, grammar and language, anthropology, social sciences, and art. I am not particularly good at <i>finishing</i> books but I read dozens of books each month in terms of pecking out chapters here and there where it seems appropriate.<p>I find it necessary to have books covering a wide range of topics - even those I have no practical use for - to act as a sort of ""mental compost"" to inspire me in my usual pursuits. I find that books on art, architecture, graphic design, medicine, and fashion all help me be more creative in other disciplines. This also goes for magazines.

I just finished ""Circles in a Forest"", a foreign book from South Africa, and I'm about half-way through ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"". (Lots of parallels to coding in this one). I've read and reread the Tolkien books as well as Ayn Rand's works multiple times, and they're on the top of my favorite list.<p>I can't think of any better activity to spend my time on than reading. Eloquence in writing and speaking is built partially from reading, reading can make great practice for formal reasoning, it helps me think of creative solutions. So much so that often, when I'm stuck, I will sit down and read a couple of pages, maybe a chapter, before going back to what I was working on.",1225797498

Every 20 seconds (hence the title of the chapter) removed between you sitting on the couch and starting what you wanted to start makes a difference.<p>I have a nice pullup bar hanging from the wall that's staring at me and every other day I follow the simplefit[2]\nprogram. Have been following it for weeks now. ""Activition energy"" being so low... even when I dread doing sport (yes, there are such days) I tell myself it's at most 20 minutes and I can start right away so the pullup bar is looking at me with a face and I shrug and do it.

3465286,comment,3464479,3464479,17,0,raganwald,,,"No doubt a lot of people agree with this post, but I feel compelled to point out that he doesn't actually present an argument, just a claim. He simply states that a lack of superficial beauty is the best indicator of a lack of code quality and then says it is such basic advice that it needn't be given.<p>It may be true, but aside from preaching to people who already believe this to be true, what does this post give us? No statistics examining Github projcts and correlating inconsistent indentation with defects measured.<p>So while the claim may be correct, I can't support this post. An interesting post would present evidence or at least hypothesize a mechanism for the relationship. For example:<p>Does inconsistent code correlate with multiple programmers working over a long period of time, adding kludges and hacks tht dilute a design?<p>Are sloppy indentors sloppy thinkers on everything?<p>Does poor architecture have a social effect that repells good coders, until sloppy coders are the only people that will work on it?<p>Personally, I suggest that one (not necessarily the only) mechanism in play on some cases is that good programmers are interested in a wide spectrum of good practices, and there is a correlation between any two random good practices on this basis alone. I wager a dozen bottles of craft brewed beer there's a statistcal correlation between consistent code style and test coverage but absolutely zero causal relationship between the two.<p>A good case for one of these or any mechanism would find me far more interested. Until then, it's folklore. It might be true, but it isn't going to persude people as much as confirm what people think they already know.<p>Also, it's crucial to establish whether there's a causal relationship. Because if not, there's a danger that everyone will rush out and go cargo cult, formatting their code and writing style guides, with the result being highly readable dreck. If you want to write quality code, we can't settle for an ndicator, we need to know which practices create quality.",1326574708

If you really do value honest discussion, I think you'll find such preaching to be self-defeating.<p>> ""...everything from Open Source software to self-published books paints a very clear and consistent picture""<p>Please do break this down with some stats and examples.  You can't possibly be so naive to think this statement will be taken as axiomatic.<p>> ""...while there are the occasional gems, most of the work simply isn't very good by professional standards.""<p>Ah, an ad-hominem of your own, most self-righteously disguised.  I am writing this comment entirely using tools that are covered under OSS licenses.  I earn my living using the same tools, and my work is also covered under an OSS license.  You'll note that I said ""earn"", and from that you might deduce that commerce and OSS are not mutually exclusive.  You might also observe a counter-point to your rather haughty categorizations of ""professional"" and ""hobbyist"" creation.  I even have hope that you may perceive the irony of accusing your opponents of being ""black-and-white"".  Speaking of which...<p>> But as long as we confine the debate to a black-and-white ""Big Media Bad, Cheap Freeloading Good"" or ""Cheap Freeloading Bad, Big Media Good""<p>You seem to have created your own personal straw-man using the most radical contingent of anti-IP viewpoints.  I'm surprised you didn't call them freetards.  Your post consists almost entirely of shallow, difficult-to-argue-with assertions seemingly aimed at thick-headed techno-communists.  Do you honestly expect many folks here to recognize only the marginal cost of content production?  Any answer other than ""no"" will tell me that you haven't been paying much attention.  So long as you only hear what you want to hear, you won't be able to intelligently converse with the many folks here who are somewhere in between the extremes.  Folks like me, who might say things like...<p>- I highly value content and the minds that produce it.  Perhaps more than anything else, art is what makes life worth living for me.  I require it, and I thus require content producers to produce it.  I am willing to pay for it, but like everything else that I buy, the cost must be sustainable.<p>- Technology has long been at point where content is presented and used in its purest form:  a totally non-rivalrous and totally non-excludable commodity.  The carriers required in earlier times, e.g. books, CDs, etc., are no longer required.  Any piece of content is now exactly equivalent to any other piece of information -- the words of a book, a song, a picture, an idea, a rumor, a number.  There is nothing novel to me about the idea of copyright, or in its value as a temporary monopoly on the distribution of information intended to incentivize the creation of said information.  Again, if you pay attention, I think you'll find this to be a commonly accepted notion around here.<p>- When non-rivalrous and non-excludable goods are treated like rivalrous and/or excludable goods for the purposes of regulation, bad things generally happen.  The methods by which this must be done are obtuse, ineffective, and in my opinion, often unethical.  Think censorship, DRM, security-through-obscurity, etc.<p>- It seems to me that if someone wants to make money from a completely non-rivalrous and non-excludable product, the onus is very much on them to distribute their product in a commercially viable way.  Some artists are embracing the inevitable challenges of making money from information in today's market.  The large distribution cartels (e.d. RIAA) have completely rejected them, and expect governments to maintain the old business models for them using force.<p>There is indeed much room for compromise, but be not mislead about the depth of the convictions of those who disagree with you, nor of the scope of their knowledge and experience.",1326574398

I can find you hundreds of potential counter-examples, and hundreds of people who will disagree with each other on the ""boring"" part.  Add to this the fact that it doesn't even <i>matter</i> what hundreds or millions of people think; in ""art"" popular opinion does not always line up with the ""connaisseurs"" or academic thought.  More people probably dislike Phillip Glass than like him, but it doesn't matter: he's still a world-renowned composer, regardless of what people think of his work.<p>I understand the viewpoint here, but pointing out mathematical structure in music / timbre / tonal sounds is not exactly new and we should stop being amazed everytime a new mathematical feature is discovered, because fundamentally the rules are <i>not</i> formal, and naturally subject to a large amount of ambiguity and interpretation.  Finding expression of mathematics in music is sort of akin to astrology--you can find lots of correlations, but at the end of the day you won't find much causality.  Imho a physicist or mathematician doing ""armchair musicology"" is just as bad as a musicologist doing ""armchair physics.""<p>The closest we can get, scientifically, is the psycological or psychophysical viewpoint-- <i>why</i> do certain combinations of harmonics sound a certain way to us that is distinct from others.  This is of course an on-going topic of research, and it has biological / evolutionary reasons as much as anything.

We should value both our freedoms and plentiful art, not just the latter as you seem to be arguing.<p>Copyright and patents are a compromise: since there are no effective business models that generate high-quality liberated content, we will make do with high-quality restricted content instead. It's the poverty mentality: since we can't have both our freedoms and high-quality content, we'll take just the latter.<p>Increasingly, though, the premise of that compromise is no longer true. Thanks largely to the Internet, more and more businesses are successfully generating high-quality open source software, and more and more artists are distributing high-quality art that they encourage people to be creative with.<p>Since we don't need that compromise as much any more, one would expect to see IP laws get gradually less and less restrictive. Every year, we should be seeing fair use getting expanded, copyright terms getting shorter and software patents getting weaker. We don't need to abolish copyright and patents all at once, until we find good enough business models that are widely applicable. But we certainly don't need more laws like SOPA.<p>> ""But some things are not changing. Good content does not create itself. Most of the time, the best content is not created by hobbyists working in their spare time, either. We've been trying this experiment for a while now, and everything from Open Source software to self-published books paints a very clear and consistent picture: while there are the occasional gems, most of the work simply isn't very good by professional standards.""<p>I suggest you familiarise yourself much more with open source software. I would argue that the best operating system kernels, the best browsers, the best servers, the best programming languages, the best databases, the best virtualization software and the best media players are all open source. Most of these (such as Linux, Apache, Firefox, Chrome, Hadoop, etc) are not developed solely by ""hobbyists"", but primarily but by fully-paid developers. The same goes for books: a lot of O'Reilly's books nowadays are licensed freely, and yet they still make a profit. These products are definitely very good by professional standards. Computer engineers were the first to catch on to these business models, but they will spread to other types of art, just as the Internet is spreading across domains. The law should embrace this change, not resist it.",1326571824

Apart of purely stylistic issues, this code is:<p>* robust, handles all error conditions,<p>* more or less well structured, I had no problems reading it, although I strongly prefer different coding style,<p>* is on par with the best examples of C code I have encountered,<p>* tricks like jumping into if(0) block are common for error handling in C.  Once you get used to it, it reads naturally.<p>So get over it, people.  Just because some code doesn't look like what you'd write doesn't mean it's bad.

3465170,comment,3464478,3464916,1,0,dangrossman,,,"> The problem with me is my app will have subdomains for each user. For example, `john.myapp.com`.<p>Sounds pretty straightforward. Wildcard DNS entry, wildcard vhost -- two lines of text that say ""point all DNS queries to the IP of my VPS, point all HTTP requests to this document root (your app)"", then your app has some code that looks at the hostname in the request to decide which site to show. Subdomains are not 'things' that take up any resources.<p>> These subdomains are each going to be password-protected areas with healthy amounts of embedded video and I just don't trust the shared hosting I currently have.<p>If all the videos are embedded offsite, then they really have no impact on your choice of hosting solution. You don't have to handle the bandwidth or storage or even the HTTP requests for the videos. A shared host wouldn't know or care if you put a million videos on each webpage -- it would have no impact on their server. It'll have no impact on yours either.<p>> What do you think of something like this from MediaTemple: <a href=""http://mediatemple.net/webhosting/ve/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mediatemple.net/webhosting/ve/</a> ?<p>Considering it's an unmanaged service, I don't see why you'd pay them $30/month when Linode is only $20/month and has a perfect review record among HN hackers.",1326571750

So they start with a little friction and see what happens. Additionally if you were a big fish buyer, you would also follow a certain pattern if initially rebuffed.  All this depends on the domain and the situation of course. If a large company wants your name they could start out any number of ways. But eventually they will throw a decent offer on the table to let you know they are serious. Obviously everything is for sale at the right price.",1326571609

3465160,comment,3464299,3464672,1,0,jmesserly,,,"Agree with parent and gp. Not only that, the article lacks an Econ 101 understanding of microeconomics. Most markets have a few big firms because of the pervasive effect of economies of scale[1]--generally, bigger firms have lower cost per unit. That's why 1-3 is common in many markets. (For an interesting discussion of why it's socially advantage to have N>=2, see the notion of ""deadweight loss"" that happens when there is only one firm[2]).<p>Article is right in one way: software is very different from physical goods. The marginal cost of each additional unit of software is 0. And there's evidence (such as appears frequently on HN) that a bigger firms do not necessarily produce software more efficiently. I've always suspected the software industry is more dominated by network effects[3], which has a similar effect on the market as returns to scale: a small number of firms & high likelihood of natural monopolies.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadweight_loss"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadweight_loss</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect</a>",1326571531
3465158,comment,3464853,3465120,4,0,Samuel_Michon,,,"<i>""To get myself to go, I tell myself that I'm just putting on my [workout] clothes""</i><p>That's a great suggestion. Also, if you exercise at home instead of at a gym, you can tell yourself you're just going to do a 10 minute set. Once you're done with that one, your heartbeat will be up and you'll have enough energy to keep up for a few more.<p>Bribes/rewards are also good motivators. If you promise yourself a minute of reading HN for every minute you work out, you have something to look forward to. (Make sure you don't let yourself take the reward before you do the work, that's a BIG trap.)",1326571494
3465157,comment,3464484,3465025,3,0,fijal,,,"well. it's not entirely true, if distributed systems were the future, we would never see multi-core systems at all, there are still tasks that are <i>much</i> easier to do if you have them done on a single shared-memory system then distributed. I don't think they're necesarilly less complex, they just don't deal with any sort of ""big data"". pypy's translation toolchain is one of those problems, but I can see a lot of situations where a large mostly-read-only set is necessary to be accessible all the time.<p>regarding ""Python is still a natural choice"" - don't confuse python as a language and python (CPython) as interpreter. You would not use CPython for any performance-critical tasks probably, at least not without spending significant time rewriting pieces to C, but PyPy is quite usable in some scenarios and the list is only to grow.",1326571486

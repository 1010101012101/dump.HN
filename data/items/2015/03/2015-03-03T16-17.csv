9138775,comment,9136869,9137214,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> Moon came into E[n]glish from Danish for &#x27;month&#x27;<p>This is flat-out wrong. Check etymonline ( <a href=""http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=moon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=moon</a> ):<p><pre><code>    moon (n.)
        Old English mona,
        from Proto-Germanic *menon-,
        from PIE *me(n)ses- &quot;moon, month&quot;
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s a straight line of descent from proto-Indo-European to modern English. No borrowing at any point.<p>Interestingly, etymonline also points out that the english word &quot;moon&quot; is cognate with the classical Greek word for the moon &quot;mene&quot;. This leads nicely into your more interesting, and less wrong, claim:<p>> the Greek name for the body was Io<p>This is a little unconventional. I&#x27;m not really trained in classical Greek, but I also thought the word was selene.<p>Doing a simple search of greek dictionary entries through perseus ( <a href=""http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/definitionlookup?type=begin&q=moon&lang=greek"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/definitionlookup?type=be...</a> ) quickly tells us that there are many, many, many greek words relating to the moon that use a form of selene or mene (aselenos, moonless; selenion, moonlight; hyposelenios, under the moon; triselenos, of three moons; numenia, the new moon; dichomenia, the full moon; skotomene, moonless night; etc. etc. etc.) Further inspection reveals that the term selene never appears in Homer, while mene does, so mene is probably older. (Knowing that mene comes from a PIE root also supports the idea that it&#x27;s older.)<p>Io also appears, with a short gloss of &quot;the moon&quot;. But the related dictionary entries don&#x27;t really deal with that sense; they prefer to define Io as the mythological daughter of Inachus. But there is a citation to &quot;Eust.ad D.P.92&quot; in which Io is the &quot;name of the moon at Argos&quot;. Wikipedia&#x27;s entry on Io (the mythological figure) also says, &quot;The ancients connected Io with the Moon&quot;, with a citation to &quot;Eustathius of Thessalonica commentary on Dionysius Periegetes, 92&quot;, which looks like the same thing as the LSJ cite perseus gives. Wikipedia also cites this to a 10th-century Byzantine encylcopedia which Eustathius is known to have been familiar with, and to a 5th-century Greek philologist. None of those cites go to web resources, and I would be unlikely to get much out of them even if they did, but it does appear that there was a minor strain of referring to the moon as Io in some places at some point.<p>But selene and mene are clearly better candidates for &quot;the word for the moon&quot;, since only they are used to form moon-related words. (Really, there are two words for the moon -- both terms appear as goddesses, but obviously have an ordinary, non-divine sense.) As far as I can see, Io is a mythological allusion, not &quot;the word for the moon&quot;. It&#x27;s even capitalized in the dictionary entry with the moon gloss.<p>How&#x27;d you learn that the Greek name for the moon was supposedly Io? Do you remember?<p>Finally,<p>> Luna was the Roman goddess represented by the body.<p>Sure, that&#x27;s true, but luna is also just the ordinary Latin word for the moon. You might notice that the same thing happens with both selene and mene. Personification deities are dirt-common in classical literature. Take the goddess who started the Trojan war, Eris. She&#x27;s referred to (by us) as the goddess of discord. And Eris isn&#x27;t really a name -- it&#x27;s just the word for quarreling and strife.",1425401935

You only have one copy at any give point, so the amount of disk space you need is basically the size of the current (or target) version of the repository—not the whole thing.<p>> This means that changing a file in a deep directory will require generating new trees for every directory up the chain—and, of course, that figuring out what changed in a given directory requires loading up all the trees going down the chain.

The problem with git is it&#x27;s more building block than slick foolproof user tool, but some of us like it that way. Git is the first prominent example of someone thinking hard about the low-level theoretical implications of version control (the idea of the state of the entire repo as a changeset, the underlying data structures, etc), and then building a tool around it that works well. When I look at SVN, for example, it&#x27;s not obvious what the hell we were even thinking - there was no theoretical framework, it was just the simplest thing that worked.

I strongly believe that it&#x27;s going to fill a missing piece in modern startup investment, and could end up being a very important program in the future, because frankly, it&#x27;s a better fit for most startups.<p>I&#x27;m not saying there&#x27;s no place for VC, but I think it&#x27;s been a big mistake to plug it into ideas that simply don&#x27;t make sense for it. There&#x27;s a reason my copy of &quot;Nothing Ventured&quot; has a pair of dice on the cover. VC is designed for high-risk high-capital projects (the Intels and Lyfts of the world), and yet we continue to use it for things it was never designed for, like low-capital web startups that don&#x27;t really require a lot of labor and simply need to find a niche in their market (let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s almost impossible to predict your market beforehand).<p>The consequence is startups that are either an enormous success or a complete failure, with zero room for deviance. There&#x27;s a big hole between enormous success and complete failure, and in practice the vast majority of startups land in it. When we don&#x27;t provide investment devices that work for that middle area (but scale to potential for enormous success when discovered), it&#x27;s no surprise to me that we assume 90% failure rates in the industry, and end up with startups that fly way off the handle, sacrificing sustainability at the altar of &quot;growth&quot;.<p>The Indie.vc proposal IMHO fills that massive hole by allowing for the possibility of moderate success. If your company doesn&#x27;t go IPO but still makes a profit, you don&#x27;t get stuck in a trap where you&#x27;re forced to keep raising money to prevent disaster (which you&#x27;re dishonestly selling as a growth opportunity), sell (often an acqui-hire that shuts down a perfectly good business) or go into an asset sale to pay off the investors. Running on that treadmill destroys a lot of perfectly good companies.<p>Neocities is in this boat. We&#x27;ve turned down quite a few offers from VCs because the terms were too dangerous for us, and I&#x27;m assuming many other startups are in a similar place. We need some investment and help to grow, but I refuse to do that at the expense of our great users. They deserve better than to lose their sites because I used them as poker chips to gamble the size of our market niche. If we get big, great, but moderate success is great too. Today&#x27;s investment devices are simply too dangerous.<p>IMHO, that&#x27;s the way startups should operate, and that&#x27;s the way our investment devices should work. Indie.vc is a really great idea.",1425401169

9138601,comment,9123683,9123683,0,0,Olivier_dS,,,"My thought of the day is that Ruby is good to know for Chef and Puppet, the market seems high for these.
Ruby On Rails is brilliant for startups and prototyping. I hear devs talking down about Ruby On Rails, taking into example LinkedIn that has moved away from Rails to Scala and NodeJs.
The thing is, when you scale like LinkedIn, servers become more expensive than developers. In that sort of situation, it becomes a lot more interesting to move to Scala.
Scala and Ruby are both in a sweet spot, but both in a different market.
Of course there will always be the fashion of the latest skewing the market, and that can make it hard to see the effect these could have on the long term.
I also hear devs talking down about the Java market. As if Java was going to disappear anytime soon. I don&#x27;t think so.
All languages suffer from programmers that have no interest to improve their skills and have a &quot;can do&quot; attitude.
No matter which language we are talking about, they are all bound to be spaghetti code at the end of the day. That&#x27;s why there are conventions and software architects. It is like building a house, getting painters, plasterers, masons and electricians to build a house, just that there aren&#x27;t any plans.
I am learning now Ruby, but I don&#x27;t think I would stay there for big applications. My problem is not the language, but the lack of tools, or to be more precise, the quality of those tools. C# got Visual Studio, PHP works great with Netbeans, Java got Eclipse and Netbeans. Ruby might be good on Visual Studio, but I got a Mac.",1425400698

That&#x27;s essentially what a driver is: an interface between software and hardware.<p>With CPUs, the code needed to run in the host OS (the driver) is fairly simple code that gives access to the CPU hardware more or less as it is: practically speaking, everything the CPU itself can do, the compiler can output code to do directly. The output of the compiler (eg. gcc) is sent more or less as-is to the CPU for execution.<p>With a GPU, we have a large chunk of proprietary code running in the host OS (the GPU driver), which provides a 3D API interface, such as OpenGL or Direct3D, to the GPU hardware. There is a huge difference between what is sent to this driver code, and what the driver sends to the GPU hardware.<p>Applications submit, eg., OpenGL instructions to this driver, the driver compiles these OpenGL instructions into code that will execute on the GPU, and sends it to the GPU. So the GPU driver essentially acts as a closed source compiler, that compiles from OpenGL/Direct3D into whatever intermediate language the GPU accepts, which the GPU may further compile into something that its processors can execute.<p>So for a CPU, the compiler does most of the work, while for a GPU, the driver does most of the work, and actually functions as a closed source compiler. On top of that the driver handles memory management, and automatically allocates memory according which OpenGL instructions are executed.<p>Imagine if Intel provided a CPU that you could only use to execute Python code. It would require a closed source driver to work. This closed source driver would compile Python code submitted to it into some unknown instructions that execute on this CPU. It would also have exclusive control over an area of memory, that the driver would automatically allocate portions of, to store data from Python variables. That&#x27;s essentially what nVidia and AMD offer, except the hardware is a processing unit that comes with its own RAM, and the language is OpenGL/Direct3D and not Python.",1425400561

For example, mapping out your customer lifecycle is a great way to measure the effectiveness of brand messaging, story and marketing strategy.<p>Simply ask: What are your acquisition tactics? How much do they cost? What are the conversion rates between each stage of your marketing funnel? How are you tracking referrals? What&#x27;s the CLV? Are you acquiring customers profitably or not? You can further optimize this process by tweaking your story or value proposition and cross-referencing these changes with the data behind your site traffic, sessions, email, referral process and landing page. Mapping out the customer lifecycle and then optimizing your funnel through experimentation not only provide an easily quantifiable standard for ROI measurement, but also help startups make informed marketing decisions to help maximize ROI and growth.",1425399940

I never heard back from them with an acceptance or rejection, until days before the programme started. &#x27;You&#x27;re in,&#x27; they said, and so my folks had to scramble to readjust our summer plans, arrange their finances to cover the program and so forth.  Not really a big deal, but a bit of a nuisance.<p>What&#x27;s the affirmative-action angle?  Well, it turns out that I&#x27;d been on the alternates list because I&#x27;m a white guy, and the programme wanted more girls and non-whites.  One of the accepted folks had cancelled, and so I got a spot after all.<p>It&#x27;s not too much of an exaggeration to say that this programme changed my life.  It opened my eyes to what eventually became my career.  It exposed me to other high-schoolers like me.  It made me friends I still have today.  It still stands as one of my most formative experiences.<p>Now, in this programme there were some students who clearly didn&#x27;t belong.  They were fundamentally unprepared (i.e., they had never been taught the fundamentals of the material).  They didn&#x27;t understand the material.  They <i>cried</i> because they were failing what was for everyone else and easy pass (literally, as in not even bothering to worry).  They held the entire class back because the professors had to spend so much time trying—and, mostly, failing—to explain basic concepts to them. The programme was a waste of their time: they learned little, if anything, and had an utterly miserable experience.<p>They were, of course, uniformly non-white, non-Asian girls.<p>I&#x27;ll pause here to note that none of this is an attack on those students <i>qua</i> people.  I&#x27;m sure that they were perfectly good people, <i>but they had no business at a university geek-kid programme</i>.<p>I&#x27;ll also note that there were plenty of young women in the programme who were quite capable and intelligent and did just as well as the young men.  The poor students weren&#x27;t poor students because they were female, or because they were non-white, but because they were unintelligent and/or uneducated.<p>Now, each spot once of those poor students occupied was a spot which could have been occupied by an excellent student.  Each of those spots represented a young life which <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> changed like mine was.  Which of those students, unaccepted because of their gender or colour, dropped out of high school, never applied to college, committed suicide or majored in some non-technical field?

2*10 physical cores, 256GB RAM, 2 TB SSD
For around ~$10k<p>So you can run AT LEAST 20 m3.medium instances on a physical box (without overbooking). If you use overbooking a single server can handle probably 40 m3.medium class machines.
So instead of 100 servers, you need 30, or more probably 20.<p>Bottom line is:

9138417,comment,9136090,9138364,0,0,aetherson,,,"This has nothing to do with any strong form of the efficient markets hypothesis.<p>If there aren&#x27;t jobs for the people in Berlin, then obviously they can&#x27;t pay these great housing prices that the OP claims they can.  I guess barring a case where Berlin is a vacation spot for the idle rich, but I don&#x27;t think that anyone is arguing that.<p>If there are plenty of jobs, but housing is super-abundant, then I suppose you could make some weird case for there being a non-efficient market that&#x27;s propping up housing prices despite there being no reason for that.  And then landlords are, heh, making a rent, not the normal one but the economic concept, and sure, Berlin is super-overpriced for what it should be.  But that&#x27;s obviously nonsense too, everyone knows that Berlin is affordable.<p>I don&#x27;t care if markets are for some reason inefficient the other direction and landlords are making less than what they ought to be -- the entire point of this ridiculous digression was the OP&#x27;s claim that Campus could design an attractive model city which people would flock to despite there not being any jobs, and the point is that Campus is a landlord.  They will not grow and become a giant disruptive force in the world if they are not making lots of money.  If they build cities in which landlords for whatever reason make less money than they &quot;ought to,&quot; then they will not grow and will not make many cities.<p>EDIT:  I think this was all lost in the weeds, so let me play out the whole thing.  I am not denying that Berlin is a vibrant, great, wonderful city that is also affordable and is attracting people for any reason you care to name.  All I&#x27;m saying is that there are two possibilities:<p>1.  Jobs are scarce in Berlin -> people do not have a lot of money in Berlin -> landlords do not make a lot of money in Berlin -> Campus could not make a neo-Berlin and then roll the incredible profits into making neo-neo-Berlin, because Campus is a landlord.<p>2.  Jobs are not scarce in Berlin -> Berlin is not the counter-example that the OP thought it was.<p>For whatever it&#x27;s worth, I think that the actual situation with Berlin is that it&#x27;s still affordable but getting less so, and the OP confused the graph with the graph of the first differential.<p>EDIT2:  In the case of Berlin, you could I suppose make the case that landlords are renting properties for low absolute rents but high profit margins, and that thus a sufficiently large landlord could use high volume to produce large absolute profits.  But I don&#x27;t think that could be the case for a new city.  Building a city is a capital-intensive process -- even if the land is inherently cheap, building the structures and the infrastructure is just expensive, full stop.<p>What (may have) happened in Berlin is that somebody did the expensive city-building and then took a bath on it.  Present landlords who are (hypothetically) making a good profit bought the distressed assets cheaply and now are making that profit off low absolute rents because essentially they&#x27;ve profited from the previous landlord&#x27;s failure.  Again, this is not a potential route to high absolute profits for Campus&#x27; potential future cities, as Campus will be the first landlord.  They will need relatively high absolute rents in order to have substantially high absolute profits.",1425399156

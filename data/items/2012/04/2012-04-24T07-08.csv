3882942,comment,3882268,3882890,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Even if you had blueprints that said ""here's exactly how to build a space telescope"" just building it and going through all the proper testing would be quite expensive. Certainly you could just privately fund, say, Johns Hopkins University's APL to build a spacecraft for you, but it would still cost hundreds of millions of dollars and still be a comparatively risky endeavor. More so when you consider that the operations side would run to the millions of dollars a month level, and require a substantial build out of infrastructure.<p>That sort of thing will happen, but it'll probably take until after launch costs have dropped a fair bit.<p>I'm not sure which Mars landers you're referring to, I'm not aware of any that were so cheap. The Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity rover) cost $2.5 billion. The total cost of the MER rovers (Spirit and Opportunity) was $820 million. The Mars Phoenix mission cost $420 million. The Mars Pathfinder mission cost $280 million in 1996 dollars, or $380 million adjusted for inflation. There have been no other successful Mars landers within the last 2 decades.",1335254372

There are only a few other usages of quietlog: motd (open file, read it), mail (check environment, stat file), and pam_silent.<p>The first two are not going to cause any kind of performance issue, so we have to look at pam_silent. This variable is particularly interesting, as it is only set to 0 if -q is not passed (and it is not) and there is no .hushlogin (it is not directly controlled by quietlog).<p>If it is not 0, then it is left at a default value, which is PAM_SILENT, and is passed to almost every single PAM function. It could very well be that there is some crazy-slow logic in PAM that is activated if you do not set PAM_SILENT.<p>Given this, someone experiencing this issue might look through the code for PAM to see if anything looks juicy (and this is something that will best be done by someone with this problem, as it could be that they have some shared trait, such as ""is using LDAP authentication"").<p>(edit: FWIW, I looked through OpenPAM, and I am not certain I see any actual checks against PAM_SILENT at all; the only mentions of it are for parameter verification: the library makes certain you don't pass unknown flag bits to anything.)",1335251567

It made a terrific marketing splash, lots of people bought the $400 one.

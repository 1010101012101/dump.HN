They attract and retain incredible talent from all sets of places.<p>Teams work with the top clients - the CEO and team as well as high flyers at more junior levels. Things get done extraordinarily quickly. And well.  But make sure that the internal team is up to scratch, and that there is that mandate from the top.<p>There is no prescription for how to deliver a project, beyond the hypotheses approach.<p>There is an obligation to dissent, and a client-first mandate. When enforced well the client gets what they need to hear, not want they want to hear. High quality consultants don&#x27;t want to work on projects justifying dumb decisions - and can choose not to.<p>Use McKinsey and other consultants to help with new issues, not business as usual. They are fantastic for quickly understanding and assessing important questions of strategy, for mergers and acquisitions, organisational design and so on. They help understand the context and set the new agenda, or validate the old one. Generally clients simply don&#x27;t have enough internal capacity to perform this work alone.<p>Use them, decide what to do and start doing it - and then get rid of them. Consultants that are camping at a client are in effect wildly expensive employees.",1371769199

Look at all the complaints about CS:GO from the hardcore players (one memorable thread involved a HUD tweak driving some clan rabid because it screwed up their grenade-throwing technique). Others complain about Valve doing nothing since Episode 2, ignoring Left 4 Dead and Team Fortress 2 and DOTA and whatnot.<p>Look at the way gamers and reviewers panned Duke Nukem Forever, ignoring the fact that dozens of people poured <i>over a decade of their lives</i> into that thing.<p>Look at the flooding of gamers over to free-to-play and ad-driven titles, pushing the race-to-the-bottom of devs only to then give angry reviews on the app store.<p>Look at how every online game reviewer and game poster crows and white knights about the portrayl of women and gender roles in games, and yet look at how they actually spend their dollar vote.<p>Look at how the gamers mocked Doom3 for having a pretty solid and amazing lighting engine and pushing shadow tech to the limits of its time.<p>Look how gamers today complain about older titles that don&#x27;t hold their hands with navigation and lots of simple mission objectives--and then bitch about how games today are too linear.<p>Gamers are the worst sort of customer after dollar web-hosting ones.",1371767316

But I do think the influence of design on the web has been too heavily tilted towards the publisher end and not enough towards enabling the consumer.<p>I have the skills and experience to retool my browsing experience for my more minimalist aesthetic, but most consumers experience the web as something more like an animated version of a supermarket checkout magazine. Since getting a smartphone a few years back, I&#x27;ve been especially struck by how much bandwidth is consumed on transmitting cruft on things like news stories, where the actual text is only a few kilobytes and relevant photographs take up no more than a few hundred kb; but after you pile on all the trackers, divs, ads, etc. etc. the page ends up being many megabytes and can easily take 30 seconds over a typical 3g connection.<p>To me that&#x27;s enormously consumer-hostile to very little real publisher benefit; the more shit I have to download to see a page the less likely I am to consume news from that source and the more likely I am to reinforce my ad blockers etc. (whereas I will make exceptions for site that make restrained use of such things so they can get a little extra ad revenue or tracking data value in return for the service they provide).",1371766757

There could be exceptions if your employer is smaller and/or several people have already opted out.<p>Couple of things to note first however:<p>1. It&#x27;s not impossible, but it isn&#x27;t likely that you&#x27;ll be able to find the same coverage on an individual plan for the same price. You could choose to opt for less/different coverage of course that is more to your liking.<p>2. Talk to your employer... they may be quite interested in learning <i>why</i> you don&#x27;t care for the plan. One of the reasons I so like HCSA&#x27;s is that you aren&#x27;t limited to such a narrow scope of services... it is basically your company saying &quot;Hey, for medical and dental here&#x27;s $2K a year. Spend it on whatever CRA figures is a medical expense.&quot; A good benefit consultant should be able to work with your employer to make their plan something that is attractive to employees.<p>3. Pay attention to the things your employer pays for beyond health and dental. They&#x27;re probably paying for Life Insurance, Dependent Life, ADD, LTD etc etc. Some of these benefits can be a lot cheaper in the plan, and are nothing to top up. Life Insurance for example you can buy as much as you want.<p>4. Make sure you qualify health wise. Apply for some optional life through your employer before you go out on your own. It would really suck to be rejected privately, then not qualify for re-entry in your employers plan either.<p>5. I&#x27;ll say this to anyone - Buy Critical Illness insurance. As much as you can afford. This benefit is such a gimmie it&#x27;s not even funny. It is basically free money to you (for anything) if you contract a major illness. Buy a house with it if you want.

7650743,comment,7650402,7650402,8,0,danieltillett,,,"For those without background in genetics the FAQ page of the paper author (Steve Horvath) is worth readings as it is a bit easier to understand than the main paper [0]. For those that think this is still tl;dr he has posted the following summary there:<p>What is new in the article? Where is the beef?<p>The epigenetic clock is the first age prediction method based on DNAm levels that accurately predicts age in more than one tissue or fluid. As a matter of fact, it works in the vast majority of tissues/fluids/organs. It is arguably the first accurate measure of age that allows one to compare the ages of different parts of the human body. Researchers who develop genomic biomarkers will appreciate its astonishing accuracy, the fact that it works across two Illumina array platforms and that it is remarkably robust to batch effects. The epigenetic clock yields many interesting insights. Here is a top 10 list:<p>1) stem cells and iPS cells are perfectly young,<p>2) the epigenetic clock works in chimpanzees,<p>3) age acceleration effects (measured by the clock) are highly heritable,<p>4) normal female breast tissue (adjacent to tumor) exhibits positive age acceleration effects while heart tissue appears younger,<p>5) cell passaging increases DNAm age,<p>6) the ticking rate of the epigenetic clock is fastest during development,<p>7) tumor morphology does not relate to age acceleration,<p>8) there is a weak inverse relationship between the number of somatic mutations and age acceleration in many cancer types,<p>9) mutations in steroid receptors are associated with lower age acceleration effects in breast cancer tissue,<p>10) TP53 mutation status relates to age acceleration.<p>The big picture: Most (but certainly not all) prior articles propose that age effects on DNA methylation levels represent noise or epigenetic drift, see for example the excellent recent article by A. Teschendorff et al (2013). Hum Mol Genet. PMID: 23918660. While epigenetic drift may explain age related changes for most CpGs, Horvath (2013) presents compelling data that the epigenetic clock relates to a purposeful biological process. Further, it proposes the epigenomic maintenance system (EMS) model of DNAm age.<p>[0] <a href=""http://labs.genetics.ucla.edu/horvath/htdocs/dnamage/faq.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labs.genetics.ucla.edu/horvath/htdocs/dnamage/faq.htm</a>",1398499180

It used to be that at least one airline (United?) would let you switch planes for free if you asked the gate attendant <10 minutes before door closing and they still had room, so you&#x27;d often end up with a few savvy travelers loitering around until the very end of boarding.  This hasn&#x27;t worked the last couple times I tried it - they charge a fee - but I still almost always ask and see what the options are if I get to the airport a couple hours before my scheduled flight and have only carry-on baggage.

This is why I can never remember people&#x27;s names. :)<p>Imagine you&#x27;ve been told that your favorite programming language has some new useful features, recent examples in multiple languages include lambdas and list comprehensions. Guess how long it will take for the new feature&#x27;s names and syntax to be permanently branded onto your brain cells -- ten milliseconds?<p>People who actually care about other people have the same reaction to meeting someone new who they might like or find useful as a professional contact -- that person&#x27;s name is instantly and permanently branded onto their brain cells.<p>But if you&#x27;ve spent your professional life in abstract pursuits -- mathematics, science, programming -- it&#x27;s very hard to make a transition to giving people&#x27;s names enough importance to remember them. But guess what? People from the humanities have the opposite problem -- they can&#x27;t remember an equation or a scientific fact for more than a few seconds.<p>A professor of ichthyology once said, &quot;Every time I remember the name of a student, I forget the name of a fish.&quot;",1398495904

7650666,comment,7648237,7648811,2,0,deathanatos,,,"> When you split code across smaller repos, you gain a different problem: version management and potentially dependencies using different versions of the same project.<p>True, you do. What you gain is the ability of small pieces to move individually through API changes.<p>If your entire codebase is in one repo (as appears to be the case here), and you want to change an API, you must either do so in a backwards compatible way, and slowly eradicate any old callers, or change them all in one fell swoop.<p>By splitting to multiple repos, you can version them independently. Thus, a project can (hopefully temporarily) depend on the old API, which only gets bugfixes, while another project can depend on the new version.<p>The tricky bit is when you have one &quot;binary&quot; or something equivalent referring to two versions of a dependency. (Usually indirectly, i.e., A depends on B which depends on D v1, and A depends on C which depends on D v2, and D v1 and D v2 are incompatible.) You can&#x27;t really do much about this, but if you keep your components small enough (think services  with well separated interfaces) you should be able to keep the dependencies small enough as well.",1398495602

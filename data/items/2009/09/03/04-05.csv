801809,comment,800937,801578,0,0,btilly,,,"For evidence of the age at which children improve on abstraction, look at Piaget's work.  The onset of puberty is when children usually move from Piaget's concrete phase to formal operations.  Before that age you need to keep things concrete.<p>The links you provide don't contradict this in any way, shape or form.  My complaint about the proposed curriculum change is that it attempts to teach arithmetic proceeding from definition to result.  That goes over kids heads.  Children learn better by repeatedly doing concrete operations that exercise the underlying concepts.  The examples of Chinese teachers demonstrate good ways of doing that.<p>In short I'm complaining about pedagogy, not content.<p>Re-read <a href=""http://www.cbmsweb.org/NationalSummit/Plenary_Speakers/ma.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbmsweb.org/NationalSummit/Plenary_Speakers/ma.ht...</a> with this in mind.  I don't see children being challenged with abstraction.  Instead I see concrete steps that are ignored in the USA being broken out and done repeatedly.  Children may not be able to describe composing a mathematical expression in abstract terms, but they can learn to do it.  And having that skill makes word problems a lot easier.<p>And, of course, the concrete skills and connected concepts give them a better foundation to build abstractions on when they are old enough to do that.<p>A random incidental note.  Your links lead me to <a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/timss/results07_math07.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/timss/results07_math07.asp</a> which suggests that the USA is not as bad in international comparisons as is often claimed.  That said, the USA clearly could improve, and Taipei would seem to be a particularly good country to learn from.",1251953653

They plan to do something on the order of 2.5 megabit 720p video.<p>4.  They intend to have extremely low end-to-end latency.<p>It should be obvious why not all these can be true at the same time.  Furthermore, you'll notice other conflicts even if you start ignoring some of the claims: even if 1) is false, 4) basically makes 3) impossible (ultra-low latency has a catastrophic effect on interframe compression).<p>So at this point I'd pretty much put OnLive in the ""extremely dubious"" category due to the fact that their marketing can't seen to decide what their technology actually does.",1251952271

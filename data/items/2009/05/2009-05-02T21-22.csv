590221,comment,588752,589320,0,0,falien,,,"I did not say that the reviewers were generally incapable of properly reviewing papers, I said that they are less likely to. While most have only the best intentions, those who are capable of subjecting research to proper scrutiny tend to be extremely busy with their own projects as well, especially considering the short time frame they often have for review. The default is to assume that if it passes the lowest threshold for academic rigour (slightly higher than the crackpot test), and conforms to certain practices which vary by field, it is publishable.<p>I <i>was</i> exaggerating, and for the most part respected journals are of high quality. That does not necessarily have anything to do with the review process. I tend to believe it has more to do with the character of those who choose to do such research (without other significant monetary motivations than the long-shot that what they're working on may produce marketable results).<p>Regardless, I would not suggest that the review process is not useful and necessary, as it is the best system we have, and works well for the most part given the dynamics of the system it exists in. I simply wanted to point out that it is very far from perfect or provably reliable (I'd argue most academically dishonest research slips through as not notable enough to warrant particular scrutiny anyway and fades into obscurity without question) and that it is vulnerable to gaming by sufficiently knowledgeable people.<p>Well, that got me off topic without even being the main thrust of my original post. Hit a nerve and started rambling. apologies if my comments came out more critical than I actually feel.",1241299287

If it provides enough power to be useful, than it's unsafe.<p>1) You have to sync to the grid, and if you go out of sync by more than x%, you have to automatically disconnect to protect the grid.  Are they doing this?  If they're not, it's because their power output is so miniscule that nobody cares.<p>2) You have to provide ability for line workers to guarantee that you aren't back feeding power onto a line they had turned off and so thought was safe to work on.  Are they doing this, or, again, is it a don't care because they're only producing 5 watts or some equally silly power.<p>I imagine these devices to be so ridiculously low power, that items 1 and 2 are don't cares.  However, are they so low powered that we don't even care about risk to the house itself?  Plugging into a wall outlet bypasses the breaker-box in the house,  Say that you're producing 10A of current with your little device.  If your breakers are 15A breakers, now they won't trip until 25A of current is running through that circuit.<p>My gut feel is that the answer to all these questions is, nobody cares, because they produce embarrassingly low amounts of power which means they're just a way to get rich off of environmental guilt....  Thinking about it that way, I'm all for it.",1241299115

I'm thinking maybe a hip, young web biz is a better fit for me, but I have nothing on my resume remotely related.<p>I know some common advice might be to build something in Python and show it to a potential employer, but I don't think anything I've coded thus far is substantial enough to impress anyone.<p>So I was wondering, would an internship doing something web-ish/pythony be an option? Even with 3 years work experience? I'd rather not live off savings, so living expenses would be nice...but is this taking a step backwards?

Small wind turbines and solar panels are barely worth the money, even in the best locations.

It's not true everywhere-- there's a lot of wind in North Dakota, and plenty of sun in places like Arizona, but those are rarities. The vast majority of houses don't have many renewable resources available.<p>Just to be clear: I'm a strong proponent of large scale renewable energy; I work full-time in the solar industry.

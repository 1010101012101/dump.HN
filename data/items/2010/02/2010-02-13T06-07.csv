1122677,comment,1120145,1121362,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"I turned on buzz for one of my Gmail accounts, for which I had already set up  a profile.  I then saw I had one person following me.  Someone I know.<p>But I did not see any indication that any of my contacts were auto-following me, or me them.<p>On another Gmail account, for which I have no profile, I signed in and was greeted with the Try out buzz? splash thing.  I clicked ""No thanks.""<p>I get to my mail page, and there's the buzz icon right under Inbox.  That's a real WTF moment.  I clicked the Buzz icon, and it appears no different than on my other account (except here I was not following anyone, and no one was following me).  So, I have no idea what that initial splash page was for.<p>However, back in my main Gmail account, I used Buzz to search for that other account. Not found.  But I have no idea what that really means.  Is it not found because there is no profile? Not found because I didn't really opt in?",1266044288

My company email address has been around and active for 13 years. I get 450 spam messages a day.

1122665,comment,1121047,1121047,0,0,gruseom,,,"Many people (including me) have wondered why large tech companies don't do this, and many people (including me) have quit and founded startups instead. I think it must be intrinsically hard to do. Look at it this way: there already is a mechanism for spawning startups that distinguishes winners and lets founders reap rewards. It's called the open market. So essentially, for an organization to succeed at this would mean beating the market. That's hard.<p>I'm unconvinced by the analogy between hedge fund managers and startups. The variation in what the former are doing is miniscule compared to the variation in the latter. That doesn't make it easy to be a winning trader, but it does make it far easier to identify winning traders and build an organization around them.",1266043365

1122661,comment,1122499,1122581,0,0,unignorant,,,"Sure, I agree that a minority opinion does not automatically pass the ""what you can't say test"". To make a slightly weaker claim, let's just say that it bothers me that people assume you can't run barefoot in the winter, when it is clearly (empirically!) possible, at least given adequate conditioning. Moreover, some of the research involving barefoot running and human biology is suggestive to me of a full-on ""can't say"" equivalence.<p>I agree with you re. the handicapped kid, but where do you draw the line? I consider a pause, eye contact, a smile, and ""I'm fine"" (spoken in a self-assured manner) reasonable evidence that I'm ok, so to speak. When they finally did stop me for good, I was engaging them in what I would consider sophisticated (polite) debate and questioning (along with ""facts""), and yet they still refused to let me continue my run.<p>As for shoes, when I first went minimalist, I jumped straight to FiveFingers. But before that, I walked around barefoot all the time, so who knows... Just progress slowly -- granted, that's advice I have not always followed ;-)",1266043201

In fact, I think the AD&D alignment system may be more than halfway there already.<p>A few months ago, we actually had a ""personality types and how to get along with them"" sort of training at work (not Meyers/Briggs, but something similar). I thought it seemed kind of bogus, so when it was time to fill out the feedback forms afterwards I suggested that a follow-up ""alignments in the workplace"" training would be at least as useful.",1266043040

6762901,comment,6760174,6760174,3,0,fixanoid,,,"Hi everyone! I&#x27;m one of the Ghostery devs.<p>Ghostery started offering Click-to-Play (c2p) functionality a little while back for some of the most common elements. Its very useful and our users love it -- it simply and quickly answers the questions like where did my video or comments go. Click-to-Play is configurable through Ghostery options and may be disabled if the user wants. (<a href=\"http://purplebox.ghostery.com/?p=1016023750\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://purplebox.ghostery.com/?p=1016023750</a>)<p>Heres a how Click-to-Play works in Ghostery. We have several databases that are shipped with Ghostery, one of them is a click to play mapper that is associated to particular trackers in the database. If a user happens to block a tracker thats on the c2p map, Ghostery will take an extra step to examine the DOM of the page where it blocked the tracker to find the visible anchor where the element was supposed to sit and inserts its own Ghostery control to let the user know at the expected place that Ghostery took action. In some cases, we advise Ghostery to attach to the parent node because the element we anchor to may be hidden or invisible. The anchors are provided by our developers when c2p entries are created.<p>Troy runs his blog on Blogspot, and the integration Disqus has with Blogspot is non-standard. Because of this, Ghostery selector for c2p relied on specific Blogspot format and attached c2p warning at the parent. A recent change in Blogspot templates have created a condition in which Ghostery sometimes removes the content of the site, like in Troy&#x27;s case. This is a bug that will be resolved in the next release.<p>To cover some other topics raised in comments:<p>- Incognito mode is a good defense, but its not foolproof. Blocking and running incognito mode is even better<p>- Disconnect is an alternative to Ghostery, but the reason you don&#x27;t see this issue with them is that it does not offer click-to-play nor does it block Disqus<p>- Ghostery, while not open-source, hosts its source for review here: <a href=\"https://www.ghostery.com/ghosteries/chrome/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.ghostery.com/ghosteries/chrome/</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ghostery.com/ghosteries/safari/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.ghostery.com/ghosteries/safari/</a>.

Making it easier to get BTC because old values which were too close to the smallest fraction floor now become splittable and more easily transferrable again. The core folks driving Bitcoin at the moment are already well aware of this risk scenario and what the set of decent mitigation actions can be. This mitigation/evolution is not unlike when key folks in the Internet community realized that IPv4 would run out one day and thus something with a much bigger pool of addresses would be needed: IPv6. A similar hack is possible with Bitcoin too, or with any other e-currency or cryptocurrency. It&#x27;s all just software. We can make it do anything we want, revise it, migrate to something else.

They were somewhat religious, but religion seemed to be more a pursuit for women. Many of that generation were involved in the anti-apartheid movement.<p>Interestingly, since the rise of the Tablighi Jamaat in the 1970s the general mood of wealthy South African Indian Muslims has become a lot more conservative. Beards and headscarves everywhere (it isn&#x27;t unusual to see women with full face veils in the swankiest Johannesburg and Durban shopping malls), and even among the less religious, the mood is generally more conservative. Political participation seems to be in decline, except for Muslim-centric issues like Palestine. Since the end of apartheid, insularity has, in many ways increased. Recent Turkish immigrants provide some liberal religious influence, but they are outnumbered by conservative Paskitani immigrants. But even without these immigrants, the trend was becoming conservative.<p>In all, there seems to have been a worldwide shift to conservatism and insularity amongst Muslims in the past few decades.

It describes the seemingly only legitimate threat at the moment for the future of BitCoin (long term).
I&#x27;m suspect that governments are now probably more interested in the &#x27;monitoring&#x27; of the system rather than governing.
In the case of Silk Road, feds seem to have done their homework when it comes to tracking down the money.  But they cracked down SR, and BitCoin dipped slightly, and the crackdown actually seemed to boost confidence in the currency.
There are points to be made I think that governing entities would want to keep a  system like BC alive (for a while), solely because it would be used as probable platform for money laundering. However if indeed, they are not confident that they can track down on money, or will be able to in the future, they would surely want to shut down BTC as soon as possible.

1) Adverts: These are often used to subsidise features and capabilities. Sometimes good EPG data needs to be paid for, sometimes you need to justify the running of applications stores. This is a business choice that the manufacturer has to make, be off-putting or lose money. Targeted advertising does increase acceptance of advertising over non-targeted advertising, however if you hate advertising your just not going to get a subsidised product (if it is economically feasible to make one).
2) Viewer tracking: This has many uses a) product improvement: by knowing how users use products you can improve your designs. However this isn&#x27;t usually done in such a scatter gun approach. b) You can sell <i>anonymous</i> information to agencies who use it to understand viewing habits and increase the value of traditional TV advertising. 
3) Third party content tracking - This could be used a) to identify working and non-working content formats, not all encoders are the same and it is a nightmare debugging all the strange formats the people of the internet generate. b) to deliver improved titling, indexing and other metadata.<p>Above all remember Hanlon&#x27;s Razor: &quot;Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.&quot;:
1) LG&#x27;s response from their CS department was composed by a minimum wage agent who got a response from their mid-level supervisor who enquired with someone in product management who badly translated that from some Korean discussions.
2) Most Koreans don&#x27;t care about content piracy, it is rife in Korea, especially with their excellent bandwidth.
3) Most of these policies were probably written by someone more interested in making the best product for the least money and probably not someone from the west.<p>I would hope that LG might pick up on this and make a better statement, but it won&#x27;t change their attitude.<p>Finally, personally as someone who makes a lot of set-top boxes I would happily see more dumb TVs, but the business of TVs is loss making. None of the big brands has made money in the TV business in ages, most people do it either for turn-over or brand recognition. Making basic large &quot;monitors&quot; is a difficult business to make a profit in because you are selling something very basic in a mature market.",1384881850

6762663,comment,6761573,6762552,9,0,kibwen,,,"I&#x27;m about to blow your mind here: Rust has <i>never</i> had a GC. Managed pointers were always backed by reference counting, and the cycle collector stopped working sometime in 2010 and was never brought back online. Note that I said &quot;<i>were</i> backed by reference counting&quot; (emphasis mine), because managed pointers no longer exist in the language (unless you turn on the backwards-compatibility flag for them, which is only being provided temporarily).<p>So there&#x27;s no longer even special syntax for a theoretical GC. Instead the plan is to greatly expand our support for custom pointer types in general, which will make all user-provided pointer types (implemented in whatever libraries our users come up with) first-class citizens. Our own stdlib will include several pointer types of this nature, including: `Rc` (reference counting), `Arc` (atomic (thread-safe) reference counting), `RWArc` (memory-safe Arc for mutable objects), and, yes, a `Gc` type.<p>And while it&#x27;s true that we may provide hooks into the runtime to allow the `Gc` type to be implemented more efficiently, any user library will be able to use these hooks to implement its own GC. There won&#x27;t be any implementation in the language itself.",1384881681

The total value of Bitcoin is about $7.5b. Incidentally, the US mint and federal reserve combined 2013 budget was $8.1b for 2013 and the total value of US currency in circulation is about $800b.<p>This raises a few interesting questions: will the logistical cost of running Bitcoin rise linearly with its total value? If so, are Bitcoin&#x27;s running costs too great to make it a viable global currency?<p>Sources:

Let me tell you as a holder of a not as valuable passport, who needed a visa to get anywhere, how I have seen the world.<p>I now live in the US. Before coming to US I visited many European countries. At the border of all those European countries I was treated as a criminal. I waited very long hours while people in front of me holding same kind of passports as me and then myself were interrogated like in a police interrogation. I missed connections because of those interrogations. In one case when I did make the connection, I heard the pilot of the plane speaking to passengers about how the delay was caused because of waiting for people of my nationality. Even people associated with people of my nationality were considered suspicious. A friend of mine was married to a Canadian man who had the same name as a famous American actor. When they tried to go together to one European country, that man was also interrogated for 2 hours by the border police because they thought his passport was fake. I was once traveling via train from European country A to European country B. I happened to be in a cabin with a man from country B. The border police of country B (this was before  Schengen) took him outside the train and interrogated him for 30 minutes because they thought his passport was fake. He had a pocketful of documents, bank cards, credit cards, phone numbers of his family members etc. and the border police still were suspicious. I was so used to the long lines and humiliation that I thought they were normal for any border crossing.<p>Then I traveled to US. Imagine my surprise when I got off the plane, walked a long corridor, passed by a drug detection dog, got into a huge room with many passport control booths, in 5 minutes found myself in one of them, the immigration officer asked me where I was going and what was the goal of my trip then stamped my passport and I-94 and I was done. Even if I didn&#x27;t go anywhere from there, the trip was already a success. It made me feel like a human. In the time since then I have seen the checks in many European countries improve and in the meantime US has added the annoying process of fingerprinting, but in my view US border control still offers better human experience compared to European countries. I was once crossing the border from Canada to US and there was this old woman trying to get into US with an expired (like 30 years old) British passport. The border agents still found a way to let her in. Since  Schengen she probably would be let into other European countries but I am sure before Schengen she wouldn&#x27;t be able to go anywhere.<p>I know that there are people who have negative experiences while trying to get into US as there are negative experiences for people trying to go anywhere, but I think most of the noise associated with them is unjustified and if US border control need improvements other countries need them even more.",1384881154

The key thing here is the ability to follow interests as well as people, but I think you are still getting bogged down in static categories. Look at how Medium has done it: Anyone can create a collection, and you can follow the collections (instead of following people). This way you empower people to curate and be rewarded for good curation, as well as allowing the followers to filter out the unwanted content. The classic example I like to use is I follow @gruber for his Apple commentary, but I don&#x27;t care about Baseball, so a few times a year I wish I could filter that stuff out.<p>On the other hand, you want creators to be able to share seamlessly, and making them categorize their content isn&#x27;t a good way to do it. Looking at the popular social services out there, making people choose a category is too much work, and is too limiting. And when you try to create a service that supports all of these needs, you end up with a really complicated tool that people don&#x27;t use how you envisioned (see G+ - it has &quot;pages&quot; to support personas, it has private sharing via circles, it has communities, but you can&#x27;t just throw all of this stuff at users all at once and expect a community to show up out of nowhere... you have to build your community)",1384881098

I take everything that Musk says with a grain of salt.<p>Tesla&#x27;s <i>goal</i> of making a mass-market car is all well and good, but they are a long way from that.  They can&#x27;t seem to make money on high-margin luxury vehicles, so obtaining the scale to build a lower-margin vehicle isn&#x27;t exactly a cake-walk.  I&#x27;d like to see them do it, but how does it happen, financially?  I&#x27;m not sure.<p>Again, my point is that this is always framed as <i>Tesla v. the Auto Industry</i>, when in fact the auto industry is also trying to accomplish the same things that Tesla is.  And, at least in my opinion, they have a better chance of actually doing it; they have the scale and profits.  Yet places like HN (see some other comments) can&#x27;t imagine these large companies pulling it off.  It&#x27;s absurd.<p>><i>I&#x27;d like to point out that the conventional auto industries and oil industries have received more than their fair share of subsidies as well over the years.</i><p>I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with those subsidies either.

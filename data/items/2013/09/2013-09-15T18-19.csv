They are created by bad governments.</i>&quot;<p>There are two models that could be at work here: (1) &quot;dissident agents&quot; occur randomly (i.e. they <i>do</i> &quot;spontaneously erupt&quot;) but have greater value and visibility when they occur amidst bad government or (2) bad governments cause good agents to become &quot;dissident agents&quot;.<p>In all likelihood it&#x27;s a combination of both: people have varying tendencies of becoming &quot;dissidents&quot;. Some people will rebel without a cause, others will follow their leaders to hell. Most are in between, more likely to (a) become, and (b) be empowered upon becoming, dissidents the more &quot;bad&quot; a government becomes.<p>There are varying opinions of what constitutes &quot;bad&quot; government. It would not be surprising that there are correlations between certain worldviews and their populations&#x27; propensities to engage in dissident activity. Stylised: pro-war advocates might be expected to go dissident quicker than pro-peace advocates.<p>Point is it isn&#x27;t obvious.

6389898,comment,6389498,6389498,49,0,forkandwait,,,"Here is my take on deconstruction, based on an MA in anthropology from a good university and some further interest and reading:<p>First of all, Deconstruction should be credited to Heidegger, not the French.  The French of the 50s and 60s read Heidegger, stole and (further) obfuscated some good ideas, then wrote books without citing him for political reasons (he was member of the Nazi party throughout the war, in good standing at the beginning and bad standing at the end, but he never rebelled or retracted publicly -- complicated person...) Then the students and readers of these French guys think the (derivative) French guys invented the idea.<p>There are two ideas of deconstruction I find useful.<p>The first is basically Nietzsche, and I paraphrase it thus:  Every metaphysics hides an implicit morality of the universe, and every morality hides an implicit and very down-to-earth will to power, and this will to power is a good thing and the drive of Life itself manifesting in human ideas.  N&#x27;s big example is Judeo-Christianity, and how by inventing a selfless morality a bunch of folks took over Western Civilization in very concrete ways. So when the Libertarians have an &quot;objective&quot; system that shows that markets are best in an objective way, or the counselors/ psyches have an &quot;objective&quot; system that shows that depth psychology is best, they are all just protecting their jobs.<p>I extend this to our modern science loving era as: any supposedly scientific system that explains things but can&#x27;t be rigorously tested just becomes wishful thinking to support the vested interests of a social group. This is basically all the social sciences, from econ to psych to anthro, and in all cases I think you can point directly to the group whose jobs or power the supposed &quot;science&quot; supports.  (Owners in the first case, counselors who want more billable hours, locals fighting off outsider meddling, etc). And, yes I know about multivariate regression and survey data, and all I can say is what a joke.<p>Now that I have rambled too long, idea 2:  I think one of the best things about Heidegger (who is fucking brilliant if you can get through his ridiculous prose) is that he asks us to question not whether something is an X or a Y, but rather to get &quot;meta&quot; and start examining what makes it possible for us to go through life assigning things too ontological categories (X or Y) in the first place.  Because the mechanism of ontology -- that everything has a &quot;being&quot;, that it &quot;is&quot; something -- is not a given, even though it comes so naturally linguistically.<p>Anyway, I should get on with my life now....",1379271462

I participated (lightly) at a Hackathon a month ago where the were some monetary prizes offered by sponsors at the end of the event.  There were two entries that seemed to have a lot of substance for a single day event, so the question tickled in my brain a bit as to whether there was a way to validate the efforts of the team from start to finish.<p>We have been wondering about the value of using a cloud IDE (disclaimer, I am CEO of Codenvy) as a type of quarantined project workspace that is managed by a 3rd party for the duration of an event, like a hackathon.  The workspace would be structured & owned by the organizer and not the hackers.  And this way the organizers could place assets like keys into the workspace, and also monitor what code is authored and / or imported into it throughout the duration.<p>We&#x27;d value the community feedback to see if there is value in such an offering.  We may want to hack one up ourselves :)",1379271438

The real reason is that people hunt keywords!<p>The time you submit a headline is very important and often leads to higher ranking, because respecting peak times, when most people use HN actively will give you more surface to positive ratings. Landing on the frontpage becomes easier that way. There are already SaaS WebApps for Twitter and Facebook which do this type of thing, it&#x27;s no different on HN.<p>The HN Mind, can actually be deconstructed more or less easily by mining stats/keywords and relations. And what I have found to be my truth is that the HN Mind chooses what it wants (everybody has it&#x27;s own truth, but the collective follows the most popular spur, just like ants do). And Fronpage posts have one thing in common, there are headlines with similar topics, that reflect the current trend of interest.<p>Do you remember the fake MongoDB Post that hit the frontpage and made a lot of HN folks believe in it initially, until someone released that it was a hoax? This made the HN Mind perplex and more careful for some time. But this careful behavior faded when there weren&#x27;t enough stimulants (hoax posts are rare).<p>What I&#x27;m saying here is that the HN Mind can be gamed and that popular headlines can put it into believing something specific as valuable. A potential attacker could benefit by this situation through systematically using posts to create false beliefs or valuations. Maybe that&#x27;s not a weakness in HN alone, but the humand mind. Our decision making process can be manipulated [1]. We inveest the same way monkeys do [2]. Politicians actively use this weakness [3] by using a manipulative language and broad media coverage, they also hire &quot;specialits&quot; that help to lie for better outcomes/rankings. HN has no measure, policies to prevent Social Engineering.<p>As the HN user @unimpressive mentioned, it is possible to persuade people with weak arguments . . . [4] This case is something that many hackers and engineers out there have been through. Altough you had a good and strong argument, people didn&#x27;t take you more serious, but accepted the case as closed.

6389789,comment,6388195,6388195,3,0,Xcelerate,,,"> When computational chemists got involved, their theories (surprise, surprise) provided support for these hand waving models. These folk &quot;knew&quot; what they needed to obtain - and they tweaked their models until they got it: the models are complex; there are lot of knobs to tweak. Incredibly, even on rare occasion when they got it right they dismissed their own results, ascribing discrepancies to model imperfections...<p>This is stupid.  My research is molecular dynamics and ab initio studies of novel carbon anodes in lithium batteries.  We don&#x27;t &quot;tweak&quot; the model until it fits; if you did that you would be 1) an idiot 2) not a scientist.<p>All models describe reality only to an approximation.  How well this approximation works depends on how good your model is.  In computational science, we have algorithms that can almost <i>perfectly</i> match experimental carbon anodes.  The only problem?  These techniques (short of someone inventing a quantum computer) take essentially infinite time to run on a classical computer.  So you cut down the computational complexity of your model by making approximations (e.g. removing electron-electron correlations) until you get something that can run on today&#x27;s best supercomputers.<p>But you don&#x27;t stop there!  You have to actually assess these models and figure out how well they work!  For instance, there&#x27;s probably 20 or so MD models that describe water (TIP3P, TIP4P, etc...)  Each model can accurately predict <i>certain</i> properties of real water, but is also very poor at predicting other properties.  In other words, your model needs to fit what it was designed for and you will get good results.<p>It seems to me that most people who bash simulations nowadays are experimentalists that aren&#x27;t up to date on the state-of-the-art algorithms that provide very good agreement with reality (for some situations at least).",1379269636

Through concerted efforts over the last fifteen years, the proportion of men in nursing has sharply increased. So the story of men in nursing is parallel to the claim you dismiss, that women are turned away from programming by its association with &quot;masculinity&quot; and that a concerted effort could increase the proportion of women in the field.<p>I do not know whether there is a genetic element to the skewed distribution of vocations, and I am actually inclined to agree with you that their probably is.<p>However, we cannot simply look at the present distribution and assume it is entirely caused by genetics. We do not live in a perfect meritocracy or a society that gives all people equal opportunity and support in following their callings. Other explanations for these gender imbalances are staring us in the face: the poor behavior of many men in the tech world, the subtle implications that girls should not work hard at math, or the teasing directed toward men who study nursing.<p>We should be trying to change these things, not for the abstract goal of having a perfectly equal gender distribution, but for the sake of individual people who are suited to these fields even though they are in the minority gender. I have a male friend who is a nurse and perhaps not suited to be a doctor who, had he been born thirty years earlier, would almost certainly have taken some other job and not lived up to his potential. I don&#x27;t want that to happen to young women who are in school today and would make great programmers.<p>Perhaps some day we will overcome these social biases so that all people are equally encouraged to do any work they are capable of learning. On that day there may still be skewed distributions of genders in each profession, and we will fairly say that those are caused by evolution and other factors we can&#x27;t control.<p>But while there are still factors in our control, preventing people from answering their callings?

At the same time, this article makes me simultaneously mad and sad, though I am sure it will serve to reinforce preexisting biases just fine, especially here.<p>Using deconstruction as a method, independent and decoupled of its own genesis, does not make sense and will yield little of use. The whole point of deconstruction is to oppose another strand of Western philosophy that, depending on country, has reigned for centuries: idealism.<p>Now, I realise it&#x27;s cool to &quot;show&quot; how much superior and empirical engineering is, but idealism is a root of many causes. It has fundamentally shaped our ideas of the University, of statehood, nation, authorship, race and the sciences. Many of the subsequent movements, starting with Marxism, followed by Nietzsche, the New Left, and deconstruction (which, really, is called poststructuralism) are an undertaking to undo some of the damage idealist reign has caused during its reign.<p>Deconstruction aims to undermine the very hierarchies idealist thought has errected: the nation as the culture of a given, demarkated and distinct people, university as a structure of educating state servants, authorship as the translation of Geist into matter, science as the study of matter, leading to the ultimate victory of ratio and empiricism.<p>If people talk about advanced programming techniques without knowing anything about underlying compiler design, algorithms etc, they are ridiculed and set in their place. If people talk about history of thought without having any idea what they are talking about, they are applauded while people cheer for their (and their own) ignorance. Why is that?<p>Deconstruction without its history is worthless. That, however, also suggests that for a history of thought, for an understanding of our present, deconstruction is indeed relevant.",1379268238

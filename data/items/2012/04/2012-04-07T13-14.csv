I think it would be quite a task to bring a Wikipedia Article up to ""featured article"" status and not understand such a basic fact about Wikipedia. I suppose my inclusion of that bit was more about the oddity of seeing things you wrote, copied verbatim into hundreds of magazines, newspapers, and online articles.

You're talking about the setting of micro-incentives to meet a goal by someone interested in a domain. I'm talking about generalized goal-setting by bureaucrats. I'm talking about why the bureaucracy isn't necessary and why we need that individual touch to decide what our goals are or if any are needed. I even admitted that certain subdomains are conducive to goal-setting. I generally include these in 'non-formal' goals because you don't take them from the Central Bureaucracy, you make them up as you go.<p>For instance, say you proposed creating music according to micro-goals. Say we live in the late 1800s. You look at the classical music and you come up with goals regarding tempo, intonation, meter, and some higher goals regarding fit and feel of the music. Then your Central Bureaucracy says, ok, this is the goal for creating music. Congratulations, you just killed jazz, and rock and roll to follow. All musical producers will have their acceptance criteria for recording a track, but it will be different from producer to producer, from musical style to musical style, more formal or less formal, and in general musical innovation comes from moving the goalposts or tearing them down.

Now that you can get all that in a computer, an ever increasing number of people see no need to have each thing in my list above.

The medium/means doesn't matter for them.<p>The standard answer given for what percentage of  communication is non-verbal is 93%. This means the Internet generation is, in effect, losing the ability to read such cues and effectively interact with others in the real world.<p>My FB is bare-bones and I seldom use it. There are purposefully only 15 people on my friend's list (because I use it for my actual friends). Unfortunately, I find little use for the site but just like I gave up household 15 items for a single computer, I'm in a somewhat ""continuously temporary state of acceptance"" when it comes to using the medium my friends use for email and invites to events.<p>What it comes down to is we consume things in 'bits and bytes' nowadays. Be it a status update, a tweet or a blog post. FB plays to this very well. There's the idea that by taking small bites of something, you eventually consume it whole.

Due to federal law the programmers must fill out paperwork for (arbitrarily) each class they build in Java (the universally mandated language accepted as the best compromise by the government, after no small amount of backdoor lobbying by Oracle).  The resulting code must pass mandated federal unit testing standards of ""100% code coverage"" due to the No Line of Code Left Behind Act.  (Various measures of quality were discussed on the federal level, but things like overall code complexity, terseness, flexibility, etc. didn't resonate with the public as much as the slogan, ""100% Coverage--you want it for your car insurance, why not your software?"", which got several freshmen congressmen elected)  In order to ensure compliance the programmers must run a special tool that verifies the coverage.  Programmers who don't achieve 100% coverage have their pay docked and/or face dismissal.  Shops that consistently fail to achieve 100% coverage face closure.<p>As a customer you're looking for a one-off administrative web application.  In several years it's delivered (along with a warehouse of paperwork) in all of its 100% unit tested glory.  As required by Federal Web Compliance 625, it uses EJB and JSP against an Oracle database.  One of the tables has data duplication, requiring Federal Normalization Exemption 835.<p>It's so late because there was a brief controversy during development.  One of the developers had increased his productivity by using a code generator to achieve 100% coverage.  Suddenly he had a lot of time on his hands--he spent it refactoring the code, building prototypes, knocking out requirements, etc.  Due to management oversight his transgression wasn't identified for several months, and the mysterious increase in productivity was hailed by local politicians as a shining example of how the system is working.  Once identified, he was escorted out of the building, and a new developer had to rewrite his code from scratch.  There was a brief splash in the local papers but that blew over, thank god...<p>During the meeting in which the resulting steaming pile of crap is delivered to you, the customer, one of the programmers breaks down crying.

I believe it's because people do think it's important what he talks about - but feel he talks about it in the Wrong Way[TM].<p>Anecdotal data points to support my view: The most hateful comments against Stallman usually appear in highly technical forums - I have yet to see that amount of negativism in the comment sections of main-stream media articles about him. Most technical people, I think, know very well what free software is, and how, generally, it helps us getting stuff done. You would be hard pressed to find a programmer nowadays who has never used any free software for his or her programs. Even if they ""only"" used Eclipse to write proprietary enterprise code.<p>Yet, some technical people are - it seems - completely against free software, and completely against RMS. But consider:<p>They wouldn't rally against Stallman if they didn't care about free software at all (""Ah, that freedom guy again, how cares""). They wouldn't rally against him, if they thought that free software was completely stupid (""Ah, that freedom guy again, well that whole free software thing will be going down the drain, anyway""). No, the only real reason to say something against Stallman is if you are  supportive of free software as an idea - but think that he spoils it.<p>If you think about that, then the people writing the most hateful comments (minus the trolls, of course) are the ones that support, and care about, the idea the most. And with that conclusion I can accept these comments, knowing that the idea of free software still has supporters, and still has people caring. Caring so much, in fact, that they even feel they have to insult a human being to get their point across - because it's obviously _that_ important. More important than Stallman.<p>I also have some anecdotes of why their fear of Stallman ""spoiling"" the idea is ungrounded: None of my non-technical friends know Stallman. None. Not one. Some do know Linus Torvalds ""wrote Linux"", some run Ubuntu on their laptops, and some know what open source means - but nobody of them thinks RMS is the sole speaker of the free software movement, as it were. I believe that even if they'd ever read an interview with him they would still be able to separate the idea of free software from the person Richard Stallman.<p>[1] I mean ""many"" here more in the sense of loudness, not necessarily of quantity - on the internet, nobody knows you're holding forty-two anti-Stallman accounts.",1333805270

3810793,comment,3810543,3810543,1,0,jeremys1,,,"Bobby Jindal is helping fix education by destroying the bureaucracy. Jindal triumphed this past Thursday in his bid to embark on an historic overhaul of public education in Louisiana, receiving final House passage of his centerpiece proposals.
In a state where student performance lags the nation, the complex bills will make it harder for teachers to gain tenure while establishing a statewide voucher program for private school tuition and multiplying the ways to create charter schools. The bills also lessen local school board authority in hiring and firing decisions, expand online schools and restructure public financing of education.
The measure also creates new paths to start up charter schools, which are publicly funded but run with broad autonomy from state and local education officials. Nonprofit corporations with an ""educational mission"" will be allowed to authorize charter schools, rather than just the state or local school boards.
It also will be easier for the state to take over a failing school.
Local school board authority will be lessened, strengthening the hand of superintendents and principals in issues of hiring and firing and giving the state education superintendent more review of local school board contracts with their own district leaders.
Current teacher tenure practice will end. Those with tenure now  or who are poised to receive it before the fall school year begins  will maintain the job protection as long as they aren't rated ineffective under a new evaluation system tied partly to student performance on standardized tests.
Anyone without tenure or who loses it because of an ineffective rating would need to be rated ""highly effective"" for five of six consecutive years in order to reach the job protection.
Statewide salary schedules for teachers will be scrapped. Teachers won't lose any of their current pay, but raises will be tied to decisions by individual principals and school leaders. Seniority won't be a primary factor in layoff decisions.

Why do a little bit extra here if somebody else in the organization is going to look at it anyway?<p>Instead, we find that really smart people are great at arguing on and on about technical stuff that has nothing to do with delivery. <i>The only thing that naturally limits this is having testable work due on a fixed date.</i> Otherwise, people would much rather create little complex systems that mirror their favorite technical book or management philosophy. There are no fights that are as vicious as academic fights over the smallest things.<p>The answer here is simple: if it's not measurable, we do not pay for it. I am sure there are lots of teams of really great people leading fulfilling lives creating quality in an ad-hoc manner that will continue doing so. We call these folks artists. There are also people who live the same kind of lives but have measurable results at the end of their creative process. These folks are usually called artistic professionals.<p>Teachers cannot be artists. The public cannot afford them to be so. They can certainly be artistic professionals, but like other artistic professionals there will be some kind of loose structure around their work product and it will be judged at regular intervals. This measure will be centered solely around students, which is natural because the only reason any teacher would be paid would be because of a student.<p>There might be a great argument about how the current tests are bad. But I think that's another discussion.<p>As a side note, and I want to make sure I hit this the right way, I do not care about teachers as such. Yes, I care about the dignity and humanity and kindness we show to all people, but teachers do not get some special place above, say, policemen. Or doctors. They're just like the rest of us.

3810757,comment,3810543,3810664,13,0,cynicalkane,,,"The thing about measurable goals in teaching is that all of them are awful. Economic psychology teaches us that bad incentives are worse than no incentives. The incentives being promulgated are things like ""higher test scores"" or ""more kids graduating"" so the system aligns itself towards teaching the test while simultaneously lowering the bar for everything else.<p>So let's talk about the software analogy. In software, the bar for formal acceptance usually really low. Do test cases pass? Maybe there's an auto-integration test that also must pass, and some requirements checkout QA has to do. You can write terrible code and have it pass the formal process, which is why you see a lot of terrible programmers coasting along at some of the worse companies. Some teams might have more formal requirements but that goes team by team. If you're working anywhere worth working, there'll be a much higher non-formal bar set by your manager, your team, your customers if you're in contact with them. So the incentives are there but they're personal and informal. The 'waterfall' pattern is one example of a misguided attempt to formalize the software dev process and align it with goals.<p>How would software devs feel if some perverse, untouchable bureaucracy measured their code according to ridiculous formal measures from the Central Bureaucracy and arbitrary rules that changed according political whims? That's what teachers are facing. I know some software devs face the same thing, but we always give them the same advice: find a better job. Teachers don't have that option because the bureaucracy is everywhere; but they can go to better (generally richer) schools, where it's a little mitigated, or they can drop out and leave that gaggle of little Kafkas behind forever.",1333803949

3810745,comment,3810290,3810290,3,0,alexduggleby,,,"I was a SharePoint consultant/developer for quite some time and still do occasional projects.<p>The current version of SharePoint (2010) is a strong product if you stay with out-of-the-box features. It has all the major features you find in the collaboration-saas-app de jour just geared towards big business and therefore less ""sexy"". The core is still built around document management (versioning, corporate meta data/tagging and workflows being the major features) and integrates well into a Microsoft infrastructure environment. There are different levels of search, but if used correctly it can become the corporate search center and index pretty much anything you throw at it (Microsfot bought an external SharePoint search product a couple of years ago).<p>I agree with struppi the wiki (both the old and new versions) don't get close to functionality & usability of modern wikis.
But I disagree on page and site creation. The default templates cover most use cases. The page editing functionality is browser-based WYSIWYG that any Office user can figure out without involving the IT department (the big selling point). Sure you're not going to win design awards doing that, but you get the job done.<p>A lot of Microsoft Access functionality is replicated via lists, linked lists and views but without the concurrency nightmare.<p>Customizing the SharePoint design always fails from my point of view (apart from basic colors and a logo change). There are great examples but they require a lot of investment and who needs it for intranet sites. SharePoint _can_ be licensed for Internet use, but I have yet to meet someone who has done that - it's really an intranet product.<p>Development on SharePoint is a PITA. Workflow development is usually the starting point and has improved over the years but getting to version 1 is an uphill battle. Sadly it doesn't end there, the real problem is updating to the next version. Without going too deep into SharePoint terminology let's just say there is not ""ALTER TABLE"" you can run on SharePoint lists which makes changing data schemas difficult.<p>Regarding search: it does work out-of-the-box (even in the free foundation version) with one exception. To be able to search PDFs additional steps are required which is indeed a PITA to setup everytime. I'm assuming this has patent reasons. Search in SharePoint was one of my favorite features if you use it to the fullest extent.<p>Having said all that (and mostly because SharePoint always seems to be the big mystery product) I am NOT building my MVPs on SharePoint. I have built a couple of products on it but due to aforementioned update difficulties on the one hand and fairly easy integration of vanilla ASP.NET web applications into SharePoint environments I mostly choose that route for my products.<p>To sum up: SharePoint has improved greatly since 2003 and is a good collaboration platform for big (albeit conservative) businesses but cannot be recommended as development platform (for any kind of non trivial project). Since it is based on ASP.NET using that and integrating with SharePoint data via the API libraries is my suggested way to go.<p>PS: I agree with eletrichead that the market for SharePoint products is large and SharePoint knowledge is a value resource at the moment.",1333803624

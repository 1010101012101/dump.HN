In fact any given ARM processor will have a fixed addressable limit. I can certainly compute a class of things in theory that the ARM processor can't compute. There are real HW considerations that you need make when you deal with an actual physical processor that don't exist in the theoretical model.<p>Obviously -- it is a finite state machine, but this doesn't mean any less that it is a theoretical model.<p>>But this is similar to a patent on a new wing design. You can say it is simply a mathematical model of airflow and such. But the pudding is the creation, not the mathematical model of the wing.<p>No -- the wing is a physical object. I can hold a wing in my hand. Conversely, a patent on a wing design does not mean that I cannot use that wing design in a computer simulation of an airfoil. But a patent on bzip does mean, supposedly, that I cannot run bzip on a virtual machine. In other words, the wing design is the point, here: you could patent a specific device for running bzip, but you cannot patent bzip on all computing devices. Which, I suppose, might help to explain my point.",1311900382

Pay profits out to the shareholders.<p>That is it.<p>These days, companies tend to do more of #1 and less of #2 -- they define ""investing the proceeds back into the company"" as increasing the salaries / benefits of the company's top executives.<p>Historically, the US government foresaw this problem of too much power in the hands of too few people, both in the government itself, and in the private sector.<p>When the Federal Income Tax was originally implemented it stated that all businesses would be liable for taxes, and only the wealthiest people (read == the ""moguls"", back in the day) would be responsible for paying taxes (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2783480"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2783480</a>).   Think about the underlying brilliance of this plan:  income taxes are tiered, based on profit (the more you make, the more you pay).  If a company was making excessive profit, it could do one of two things to ""decrease"" the tax burden:  hire more people, or create a ""market"" for stocks that can reward the common Joe.  The original income tax laws laid out would have allowed a company to pay someone $100K (in 2011 dollars) tax-free.  However, that $100K, if kept as ""profit"" for the company would be subject to Corporate income tax.<p>(Q:  Guess who voted NO on letting shareholders vote on executive compensation? (Jul 2009)) Hint - <a href=""http://www.ontheissues.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ontheissues.org/</a> )  (A:  the speaker of the House).<p>When shareholders aren't allowed to regulate their ""ownership"" of a company (especially when it's just tiny percentage), they don't get a say on how those profits are used, and executive salaries continue to bloat.  Those at the top whine, complain that they are the ""job creators"", and should not be subjected to such taxation.  But this is exactly what is supposed to happen: their salaries would not be so high if the companies they controlled  were not doing so well.  If they're doing well, they should be either hiring more people (people with jobs would be less reliant on government assistance), OR gradually increasing the well-being of shareholders by paying out dividends to those who own only a tiny fraction of the company.<p>But, it's not working out like that.  The checks and balances that the founding fathers put into place to prevent the notion of absolute power corrupting absolutely have become weighted down by the greed of a few.",1311900089

I am saying that it is vastly more difficult than it needs to be to write good code in Java because it is insufficiently expressive.<p>I <i>will</i> say that I am suspicious of the ability to write good code of people to whom Java is not a poor development choice, because I suspect brain damage, but a decent programmer can write fine Java. It just sucks to do it.<p>.<p><i>>> You are generalizing and that makes you sound like and troll even though I know that is not your intention.</i><p>I am doing no such thing. You are misunderstanding me, but it's pretty clear from the upvotes that you're the only one.<p>.<p><i>>> I personally have never really had an issue with Java so I don't really understand the hate.</i><p>It is likely because you think in Blub. Read pg's article regarding Blub, <i>Beating the Averages</i>:<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html</a><p>He makes the contention that Lisp is at the apex of the pyramid of software development tools. I disagree, for a number of reasons, but the contention of the article is correct at its core: once you have the perspective of a decent set of other tools, you realize that regardless of your tools of choice, Blub languages rank very low on the scale of expressivity--and thus, in power and ease-of-use. (And everyone should learn Lisp, anyway. Even if they don't write code in it. I think in Lisp when writing Java, and aside from Java's miserable boilerplate, my Lisp-in-Java is better than your average Java programmer's Java-in-Java.)<p>And I would submit that Java is one of the most Blub languages in common use. You have no basis for understanding why others <i>would</i> have an issue, because you are looking up the continuum without insight into what is above.<p>.<p><i>>> Yes, there are sucky frameworks out there but you do know that you don't have to use them?</i><p>Meaningless statement. At my current employer, we are forced to use a legacy servlet infrastructure, but my own Java (and Scala) code uses Play! and other frameworks and libraries that at least attempt, if not always successfully, to drag Java reluctantly into some semblance of modernity.<p>Writing Java still sucks.<p>.<p><i>>> Either I'm writing really simple code that Java never gets in the way, Java is not really a problem, or I'm a super programmer.</i><p>Or you are insufficiently experienced with better tools to be able to reliably determine whether it is <i>done better elsewhere</i>. One who does not know any better may be happy with Blub, but one who has used better is not. This seems eminently straightforward.<p>.<p><i>>> And I write similar code in Objective-C, C++/C, JavaScript and even had to write a lot of code in VBA.</i><p>I'm beginning to see your problem. With the exception of JavaScript, you <i>do</i> work in Blub. And I'd bet that you write Blub in JavaScript, too, instead of JavaScript in JavaScript.<p>.<p><i>>> Every language has its own nuances, you just find the best way to work with them, ignore the junk, and adapt. Which is why I really don't get where all this hate is coming from.</i><p>Nonsense and worse words. The best way to ""adapt to Java"" is to download a Scala compiler. Spend a few weeks using the JVM with something modern like Scala or Clojure and you <i>will</i> get where the antipathy towards Java comes from.<p>Java commits the ultimate sin a programming language can commit: <i>it wastes my time</i>. It is a language designed by committee that does nothing excellently. Its successors on its own platform do not commit the same sin and I am more productive for it--they are <i>better</i> for it.<p>.<p><i>>> You never hear this for C++ and it can also be a pain in the ass</i><p>This is blatantly untrue, in my own experience. I can rant on about C++ quite successfully and at great length, because C++ has its own share of problems. Where it differs is in much, much greater expressivity--that C++ is capable of supporting Boost is a perfect example of this expressivity. It is by no means perfect, but it is certainly a smaller problem than Java.<p>And unlike Java 7, C++0x actually fixes (most of--templated lambdas are unavailable for what I consider fairly stupid reasons) the problems that. Oracle decided to push anything useful out until Java 8, and I'm skeptical it'll actually keep the promise of ""next year.""<p>.<p><i>>> Is almost like it is cool to hate on Java.</i><p>You lack the breadth of experience to make this claim.",1311898754

One day you realize that most of the people of your age are so far, far below your ability it's just sad. You try to help them, but everyone know it's not easy at all. All the work you've done to get to this level seems to be very natural for you after all these years, and you have no idea that most of the kids were not doing _anything_ in their childhoods. Then you got this feeling that all your ""genius"" skills came undeservedly and it's really depressing, because they constitute your person, and you really would like to believe that you got there by your own work, cause it does not feel fair otherwise.<p>To work out this cognitive dissonance, you start to look what you did differently than your peers and you notice that you were doing math (or cs, or electronics, or biology or whatever) as early as you remember, while your averagely performing mates from university only started doing something serious in university classes or maybe in high school. This feels like a pretty good explanation, especially when one takes into account a 10 000 hours rule, but being a rationalist (who you surely are), you cannot discard the impact of your genes, but as long as it is not measurable, you can believe it's small.<p>That's how you come to the state of mind when saying things similar to the quoted ones seems pretty natural and not at all out of touch with reality.<p>(I say this from my own experience, so it's easy for me to sympathize -- I'm not as brilliant as the guy from the article, but I'm getting two bachelors (math and cs) next year, by then being 20.)",1311897899

Net Neutrality is about ensuring consumers have equal access to providers of content and providers of content have equal access to consumers.<p>It's not about allowing piracy - quoting wikipedia:<p>""Chris Elsworth, the main operator of Newzbin, had said repeatedly at trial that he had no knowledge of infringement occurring on the service, and that Newzbin's categories for ""CAM,"" ""screener,"" ""telesync,"" ""DVD,""R5 retail"",""Blu-ray,"" and ""HD DVD"" didn't suggest any evidence of infringement.""<p>These guys were ripping people off and got shut down.<p>Net Neutrality is about making sure YouTube doesn't pay your ISP more to favor them over Vimeo.

We have been tossing back and forth ideas about a project to work on together, but from the first convo to now the it has grown from a basic facebook app to a full scale web service with a fully functional API and capabilities to scale in a potentially infinite way.<p>Obviously this puts a little more time and pressure on me while also raising the bar from the original project scope.<p>Per my request I will be the sole developer on the project unless I deem help necessary at which time I will have discretion over who is hired and for what.<p>But my real question is, What(in equity) should I expect from a project like this? I have already said that any expenses incurred will have to be picked up by them, but what else should I be looking for here?<p>a deal that once looked good to me and that could be fun looks like it could turn into a monster of a project.<p>I would greatly appreciate any thoughts or feedback on this subject and look forward to hearing similar stories with both good and bad outcomes",1311897658

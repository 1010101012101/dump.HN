8837597,comment,8836734,8837338,0,0,ploxiln,,,"I&#x27;ve used linux since 2003, and windows before that, on PC hardware. In 2012, I was looking for a good laptop, and could not freaking find one that wasn&#x27;t an Apple Macbook something. So I got a Macbook Air and installed linux on it.<p>Your case is extreme. But on every windows install I&#x27;ve seen at least one of these kind of inexplicable un-fixable problems you just have to re-install to fix or live with.<p>I like linux because every file is owned by a package, or it&#x27;s a plain text config file in /etc, or it&#x27;s in my home folder and has absolutely no effect on another user. It&#x27;s just generally more under control. Files are not just modified by patch installers etc. So I love OS X app-folders, but many things for OS X use pkg installers, including stuff from Apple, so it&#x27;s kinda the windows situation again, just a bit more transparent because it&#x27;s mostly unix.<p>My tips for Windows: don&#x27;t do what your mother would do. First things first, go into Programs and Software in the control panel, and uninstall stuff, even stuff you don&#x27;t recognize. Check the Device Manager to see if you&#x27;ve accidentally uninstalled a driver, and if so re-install it (get it from the laptop manufacturer&#x27;s support website). Don&#x27;t install or run Microsoft or Adobe (or Apple) software, stick to the open-source windows software where possible, like 7-zip, sumatra-pdf, Libreoffice, Firefox or Chrome, etc. Also go ahead and disable System Recovery on all drives, to save disk space and performance, since if something goes wrong you&#x27;ll have to re-install anyway.",1420439346

And I agree, OS X offers a few marginal benefits, and some drawbacks, but it&#x27;s not much further ahead.<p>OS X advantages:<p>- Entertainment:  OS X has better entertainment options and ecosystem, iTunes mainly, though Amazon MP3, Amazon Prime Video, and Netflix are negating this as advantage.<p>- 3rd party desktop apps:  I find little gems in both OS X&#x27;s app store and in Ubuntu&#x27;s &quot;store&quot; and repo&#x27;s, but the best on OS X are generally better than the best on Ubuntu.  Notepads like Quiver which integrate Markdown and LaTeX, Slack&#x27;s only native app (or native-wrapped web app) is on OS X, Kindle native app for OS X, etc.  That said, Ubuntu&#x27;s good enough that I wouldn&#x27;t miss OS X in this respect.<p>- Overall better for lay people and non-techies.  Gestures, etc.  Still complex though, just as difficult as Windows for non-techies to learn.  For example, I&#x27;d love to recommend to my almost 70yr old parents they switch from Windows to Mac, but the learning curve now is too steep.  This is one of the disadvantages of adding lots of features to an OS - higher learning curve.<p>OS X disadvantages<p>- Stability:Price ratio:  OS X is significantly worse.  About the same stability as desktop linux but at a much higher price.  I can crash both OS&#x27;s by abusing memory (eg, too many apps open + too many browser tabs).  A free OS I can forgive, an expensive one tailored to a single custom hardware configuration I can&#x27;t.<p>- Lock in:  little things like having to take your Mac to a service center to replace the battery, or the inability to copy your entire home partition over to a new computer, etc.<p>- FOSS:  personal preference, like knowing my computer has the many eyeballs effect.<p>- Overall better for power users.  Tiling window managers, ability to keybind <i>everything</i> to Vim keybinds (file manager, all browsers, even Emacs), means you can easily dispense with mice and gestures altogether and use a much faster and more powerful interface.",1420439345

My backround is that I used Windows 2000 and XP from 2001 to 2003 after that Linux for three years and then OS X until 2013, now back on Linux.<p>I bought a used ThinkPad because I heard that that is the hardware which would work best with Linux now and I installed Ubuntu on it. Everything worked ok but just the OS filled up half of my small 128 GB SSD and running only Firefox for browsing got up the load to over 0.5, which made everything not so snappy.<p>A couple of months ago I moved to archlinux with Gnome 3.x, it was a bit more complicated to install, that I admit, but it was so worth it! After installation the system used less then 3 GB of my SSD, and now running just firefox the load is on about 0.01 which makes this ThinkPad from 2010 one of the snappiest computers I ever used. All animations are smooth, not a single application ever crashed or hanged itself and so on. But yeah admitedly I mostly only do development, email and websurfing on it.",1420439226

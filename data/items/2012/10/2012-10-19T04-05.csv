Are you sure you're not thinking of Balsa?<p>Balsa is a hardwood despite being so light, so it has capillaries in it. The wood is cut into blocks and then the end-grain is pressed into the wetted-out FRP mat. The resin in the mat is drawn into the balsa through capillary action forming a very secure bond.<p>Manufactured foam core material doesn't have capillaries and therefore has trouble forming a bond with the resin. If you're using foam instead of balsa core, the manufacturer will specify a bonding agent that you need to use between the mat and the core.<p>If cork were to be used as a core, I'd think it'd have the same problem bonding with the resin as foam has, and you'd have to use a special bonding agent formulated for the cork.<p>EDIT: Heh, after posting I decided to google around for cork FRP core. It turns out there is a company selling a core material manufactured from cork: <a href=""http://www.mcmc-uk.com/products-corecork.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mcmc-uk.com/products-corecork.html</a>; most of the users of it I can find are surfboard builders though.

4672321,comment,4671530,4671787,27,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,">I don't think that decreasing risk will result in more entrepreneurship.<p>TOTALLY disagree, as well as with folks who are saying that ""risk is an important part!""<p>For one thing, there are a series of studies that show that people who are more risk tolerant actually create worse start-ups (for example, [1]). There is at least one meta-analysis that indicates that there's more risk tolerance in entrepreneurs (though the individual studies on that point are contradictory) [2], but OF COURSE there's risk in going off on your own, the biggest one being the opportunity cost of the cushy salary you're foregoing for a year.<p>No, it's not for everyone. But that doesn't mean that people who start businesses are reckless, and it is HARD to get a good price on health insurance in most states -- and if you get badly sick in the US WITHOUT health insurance, you're screwed (if and when the health insurance reform kicks in, this could change).<p>I personally refused to quit my job until I knew I'd be able to get health insurance, and it was much harder than I expected despite not having any health problems (as in, I was denied by two providers and had to get the ""high risk pool"" insurance). So I think it would be effective to reduce the risks of entrepreneurship for people in my situation (i.e., over 35 years old). It's risky enough to begin with; no reason to make it a matter of life-and-death as well.<p>[1] <a href=""http://paraplyen.nhh.no/sfiles/85/88/1/file/hvide-panos-2012-.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paraplyen.nhh.no/sfiles/85/88/1/file/hvide-panos-2012...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://psycnet.apa.org/?&fa=main.doiLanding&doi=10.1037/0021-9010.86.1.145"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psycnet.apa.org/?&fa=main.doiLanding&doi=10.1...</a>",1350622439

So while the concept of renewable energy is non-partisan, policies/discussion relating to funding and regulation of renewable energy can be quite partisan.<p>EDIT: <a href=""http://www.people-press.org/2011/11/10/partisan-divide-over-alternative-energy-widens/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.people-press.org/2011/11/10/partisan-divide-over-...</a> - see the chart near the bottom, titled ""Partisan Gaps over Energy Policies"".<p>I would say something similar is the case with respect to many other issues that sound non-partisan, like national parks -- peripheral issues like government funding and restrictions on private enterprise (logging on federal land?) can lead to a fairly significant partisan divide, even on issues that don't seem controversial.",1350622435

Where I differ from you: 1) I am female. 2) I have a prescription for birth control.<p>Currently, my birth control prescription is through Planned Parenthood, and it's cost me about $25/month for many years.<p>When I applied for my own health insurance, they asked me to list any prescription drugs I took. Even though I get checkups and my birth control prescription from Planned Parenthood, I dutifully listed it in the form (knowing, too, that lying about this might cause me to get disqualified if I claimed something later.)<p>I received a letter from the insurance company that I had been declined for insurance. Reason? Prescription medication.  This was the <i>only</i> prescription I was on at the time. Yes, apparently the fact that I have a prescription for birth control makes it worth it for a health insurance company to not insure me. This is <i>completely legal</i> for any insurance carrier to do in the United States if you are a single person applying for insurance. And guess what? Once you've been declined for single-person health insurance for any reason, you're pretty much screwed.<p>I don't know what the solution is, and I don't think our government got it 100% right when they passed different laws recently. But I also know that something is not right when I can get declined for health insurance for being on birth control (that the insurance company would not have even had to pay for anyway.)<p>The system is broken, and you are the exception.

One, the plans offered through the MA Connector may not be as inexpensive as plans negotiated by an employer, so you may wind up paying more for the same coverage. There's alao the issue of finding a plan with doctors in the same network, you may find yourself paying a little more if you have a favorite doctor treating you for a pre-existing condition.<p>Also, you are only allowed to enroll in MA Connector plans during one (maybe two) ""open enrollment"" periods during the year, so you may be faced with a gap between losing insurance coverage after quiting a job before being able to enroll in a new plan. Of course there is always COBRA, but again the amount you pay out-of-pocket for the premiums go way up.<p>But you are correct that insurance co's in MA generally can't reject you for pre-existing conditions.",1350620968

Many things, distributed over the house?  Expensive.<p>Lets think of one device, a relay (or solidstate relay) that controls an outlet.<p>You need:<p>A radio, or a powerline networking unit ($10). Some sort of processor ($45 for a Pi w/ps and sd card). Some low level logic to connect to the relay ($.25), the relay ($2), and the power socket ($2).<p>If you want to control two outlets at one place, you're only duplicating from the low level stuff to the power socket. That's another $5.<p>If you want to do this at a location that's more than a usb cable away from site #1, you're in for another $50.<p>The holy grail here is a wifi enabled power socket. All it needs is a small api: status and on/off. Bonus points if there's a current sensor. This could be done with the processor from Bunny's $12 phone and the power relay bits.<p>But, it's got to be priced in the $10/socket range.",1369166392

1) Go lobby for components from various manufactures to meet the next-gen specs (whatever that may be)
2) Create tools and APIs for developers to understand the platform for which they are building
3) Improve existing services so that gamers have a consistent and enhanced experience<p>Its a lot of work, but its no rocket science either. Every console does this. Which goes to my point...
When it comes to the games, these consoles are basically the same thing (especially the ps4 and xboxOne). Sure, some platforms may have an exclusive here and a different game there. Overall, the ps4 and the xboxOne will be matching one-for-one the basic gameplay mechanics.<p>What Microsoft did was say ""alright, lets not focus on the redundant, but lets take a look at what separates this console from the other one (ps4)"".<p>This is just an unveiling of what the console is. Don't worry, the games are still here. They will always be here. They could've made a presentation with nothing but demos. Sure, gamers would be delighted. But, if you think of it, it doesn't make sense to do so. Especially that E3 will be coming in only a couple of weeks. There will be plenty of games there.",1369166179

Apps that require Google Play (e.g. for in-app purchases or license validation) already need to find some other option if they want to run on devices running stripped-down Android distributions.<p>I don't think it's fair to characterize this as lock-in, because apps are free to use some other mechanism to implement provided features (or just disable them if not available).",1369166168

It focused on TV, for which many of the core gamers don't care. Contrast this to the PS4 announcement, which had many developers and a lot of talk about how the platform is going to be more ""open"" for the small guys, and it felt really passionate about the ""for-gamers"" features. As a gamer, I feel like the PS4 is where the real passion for games is, where someone actually cared to provide tools for the ""indie"" crowd (who, arguably, are doing the good games these days) ... Meanwhile, microsoft is showing a TV machine, has forgotten the indie channel and has killed XNA.

This is mainly because I started ""in the middle"" and so I couldn't just run it, I'd have had to have written supporting code.<p>I've finally got to the stage where I _can_ run it.

Surely that's false advertising, by saying your food can replace all other foods, while your food hasn't even been tested yet? I'm sure if it was just some fruit smoothie thing they could get away with saying that it's a healthy food. But as a complete, all-round food-replacement? I'd be careful with that.",1369164957

If I knew what package had problems, I could fix it with `dpkg` or even `ar -x`, since Apt-Get really wants Debconf and friends to work in order to do its job... but as-is, I can't even install any version of dash from the correct repositories without bombing out in post-install, and I feel really lucky to even have a shell to attempt a fix, at this point.<p>If anyone has a Pi and they're comfortable breaking it (to see for yourself, or to help me figure it out), change your apt-sources to like this:<p><pre><code>  deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian wheezy main

If you are on raspbian and your arch is armhf, proceeding through `apt-get update && apt-get -uy dist-upgrade` will almost totally hose your system.  Reboot, log in, have a keyboard and mouse for the next part.<p>Network/interfaces will be broken so you'll need those, because you just ruined /bin/ip, it will segfault.  Keep a copy of the old iproute package from raspbian, or be sure you know how to use ifconfig and route to get back online so you can download another one, since dhclient will also be hosed.  It either segfaults or depends on /bin/ip.)<p>The only way to come back from this I've found is re-flashing the original raspbian image.  I can't do it because my SD card does not read in my laptop / I'm stubborn and convinced that it can still be fixed.<p>You will not be able to install any packages that have Debconf post-install hooks, b/c illegal instruction in perl, some depended module.  That's the part I can't figure out.<p>A lot of other things will be broken until you revert libc6 and libstdc++6 to the version provided by raspbian.  At this point,<p><pre><code>  dpkg --get-selections|cut -f 1

The greenest associate at a big NYC law or consulting firm probably has just a few levels above him to the managing partner or CEO. The structure is instead broad and flat, with potentially hundreds of partners or managing directors leading their teams with high levels of autonomy.<p>Pay spreads are also narrower. I don't have numbers for consulting, but many NYC law firms are 5:1 or less top to bottom for partners, and around 30:1 for highest earning partner down to greenest associate (and many of these scales are lock-step, meaning everyone at the same level of seniority is paid the same). Finance is of course broader (thanks to huge bonuses for traders), and my impression is that consulting and accounting are narrower. The pay spread at Yahoo between Marissa Mayer and the most junior programmer is more like 250:1, and even within the ranks of executives the spread is probably more like 50:1.<p>The deep irony of these professions is that while they are a major part of the capitalist system, they are personally mostly free from that system.

Less cash = more equity.  Cash is expensive relative to equity for a start up and payouts are backended. In traditional firms (ie ones that make money) - your salary presents a larger % of the total comp pkg.<p>2.  Human capital more important (in tech vs traditional businesses) = equity alignment is more important<p>3.  VC rounds typically structure 10% to 20% option pools in to contracts.

Generally libertarian views (support for free markets, drug de-criminalization, gay rights, right to bear arms, open borders, etc...) but where views on social issues (namely basic civil liberties, gay rights, drug de-criminalization, open borders) trump (by far) the economic issues.<p>Most of these folks also don't subscribe to Randian/Nietzschean ""virtue of selfishness"" so given a candidate whose economic policies might benefit them but who opposes gay rights and immigration, they'll vote for his opponents even if they happen to be straight and native-born.<p>* Conventional style liberalism, but with heavier focus on civil liberties and technology. Zoe Logfren is probably great example of candidate that appeals heavily to this group.<p>* Bloomberg-style centrism: some degree of social liberalism (particularly in regards to gay rights, abortion), moderate-to-center-right economic views (mainly dictated by self-interest), but strong opposition to personal liberty-issues that are perceived to have social costs (e.g., drug de-criminalization, right to bear arms).<p>This is generally common with older folks, likely the ones that supported Reagan and Nixon earlier. Generally these are also the view of many California republicans (e.g., Meg Whitman) but also a significant chunk of Democrats. Given national republican party has now deviated from significantly from this view (with big factions now being religious right, Tea Party, and some libertarian-leaning folks), again there's a tendency to vote democratic on national level.<p>* Actual libertarians tends to be somewhat more common than in the rest of the country, but again there's a tendency for people to come to libertarian views from a more academic point of view (study of economics, philosophy, etc...) as opposed to from reading Atlas Shrugged.<p>So yes, if you define libertarian as Objectivist (a view that goes far beyond libertarianism -- the idea that poor deserve to be poor and do not deserve even voluntary charity, as opposed to the idea that economic planning hurts the poor more than it helps), then there's only few libertarians in Silicon Valley.

On one side you have billionaires who care about social liberalism, on the other you have billionaires who care about economic liberalism.

They don't exist.<p>There used to be institutions that brought these issues into the discussion anyway, like political parties and labor unions.

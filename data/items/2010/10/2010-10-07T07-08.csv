So 0% until 1 year (then 25%) then every quarter they'd get the next chunk.<p>The equity they get should be a reward for work they've done, not work they're going to do. So if they work their ass off for years they should get their equity and you shouldn't feel negatively about it.<p>Their piece should be quite small relative to yours. If you gave out 15% in an option pool only 7% of it might have been vested and exercised. That's not very much if it meant you got to have really great people work their ass off for you over years.<p>If you do it right you will not regret them owning a small piece of your company because they should have contributed to moving it forward in a big way.<p>You should be thinking ""Bob quit and owns 1.25% but he did do X and that helped us grow so quickly and smoothly it was totally worth it.""",1286437579

or you get 25% of that a year?<p>the former sounds a bit too draconian.  I mean, I don't expect anyone (save for myself) to stick around that long.<p>the latter would stick me with the same problem I have now...  the thing is, every year that goes on, I'm investing what amounts to a pretty large chunk of cash into the company.  If you earned 10% 5 years ago, that's fine, but c'mon, my ongoing contributions should mean something, too.<p>My point is that without dilution, as time goes on and I accumulate more (no longer working) people with percentage ownership in the company, my motivation to continue to invest decreases.  If the company increases in value fast enough (and if my free-market value doesn't increase dramatically) that the percentage of the company I still own is worth the investment, we don't have a problem.  But if I become more valuable or if the value of the company stagnates, my motivation for continuing to invest will decrease with my percentage ownership.  I'll be thinking more about how to buy out those who are no longer with me rather than using those resources to move the company forward.<p>I could issue a new options pool (that dilutes existing shares)  every year, but I don't really see the difference between that and what I proposed, other than it's options rather than equity.",1286436721

Francisco's speech excoriates the latter; but it has little to say about the former.<p>In fact, it has contempt for what it describes as fools, and seems to equate monetizable value creation with moral righteousness; as such, it works well as a justification for selfishness for those well placed in the nexus of supply and demand, whether by luck or skill.<p>Of course, relatively little value creation is monetizable, and that creation which is is generally not rewarded in full according to its value. because of transaction costs. Much as we'd all like to be independent short-term contractors selling our valuable output to the highest bidder at every moment, we can't - the ancillary costs are too high, most of the time. So, most of us undersell our skills for a longer term contract, and the surplus is collected in proportion by those who own the most capital.<p>It's my personal suspicion that Ayn Rand is held in such high regard largely because of the guilt it assuages in people who would otherwise be uncomfortable feeling ""greedy"".

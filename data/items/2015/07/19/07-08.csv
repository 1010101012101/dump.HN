9910412,comment,9910146,9910146,0,0,kayoone,,,"Imo web development in the open source field is a lot more complex than say developing in a strictly Java or .NET environment.\nLet&#x27;s face it, most .NET or Java programmers are building some kind of CRUD app too.\nOver 10 years ago i have started with PHP and Perl, going from horrible spaghetti code to full fledged Symfon2 apps that use abstraction layer upon abstraction layer. I have written NodeJS servers that analyze event streams of hundreds of servers and push realtime statistics to AngularJS frontend apps. These days i am building apps in React and am exited for the prospect of React Native. I have also worked in C# and Unity3D for game programming and built realtime multiplayer 3D action games. At heart, i consider myself a programmer who uses the right tool for the job and i work primarily on the web. I am still proud of it because it&#x27;s one of the most vibrant fields of tech to be in and companies pay good money for my work.\nEven though i did lots of PHP in my life, i never ever touched the code of Wordpress or Joomla or similar though.",1437292745

I mean, yeah, it gives them a leg up - but there&#x27;s nobody willing to put in the time and money to figure out what&#x27;s in their cymbals, because it&#x27;s just more worth it to make your own.<p>The Zildjian name is more valuable than any of their cymbals. If you don&#x27;t buy Zildjian cymbals, it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re too expensive, or it&#x27;s because you don&#x27;t like the sound.

9910393,comment,9909069,9909069,0,0,ectoplasm,,,"Alright, so the reasons I&#x27;ve heard over the years that vinyl sounds better are:<p>a) the high-frequency roll-off starts at 15 kHz; b) the needle vibrates which smooths out the sound and provides warmth; c) the needle melts the vinyl at the molecular level which also smooths out the sound and provides warmth; d) the needle picks up feedback from the room; e) not all vinyl is created equal, you get a lot more quality out of a 5-minute 12&quot; 45 rpm than a 30-minute 12&quot; 33 1/3 rpm; f) clicks and pops and burns are part of the charm; g) the runout groove nagging you to get up is part of what vinyl sounds like; h) vinyl is physical and cool and sometimes extremely rare and barring an ABX test your perception of how good something is will be affected by these supposedly irrelevant meta qualities; i) some things are only available on vinyl, so of course it sounds better; j) depending on the type of music, the mastering won&#x27;t be targeting mp3 players with earbuds but instead big club systems, so if you have good speakers, it might be easier to find the mastering you want on vinyl.<p>I don&#x27;t know how many of these I agree with.

The Internet gives you many more options than we had available prior to the existence of it.  Choose wisely and re-evaluate that choice periodically to see whether your peer group continues to represent your goals and values.<p>Why?  Your peer group literally gets arbitrary code execution on your brain.  (It&#x27;s a flaw in MonkeyBrainOS 1.01 which we haven&#x27;t patched yet.)  You&#x27;ll tend to find yourself valuing what they value.  You will tend to find yourself achieving outcomes strikingly similar to their outcomes.<p>Given this, picking a peer group whose values are not your values and whose outcomes are terrible is a poor choice.<p>There is some cognizable peer group of &quot;the most misanthropic 10% of commenters on Internet threads about programming languages.&quot;  The majority are not professional programmers.  Most are not very happy people.  You can generally tell a lot about what a person values by what they spend their time doing; someone who professes to value the great intellectual challenge that is Real Programming but actually ships comments which make other people feel bad probably, to a first approximation, values making other people feel bad.<p>If you do not also want to grow into a values system where making other people feel bad is the highlight of your day, consider choosing a better peer group, where e.g. feeding one&#x27;s family through honest labor is valued and having very loud opinions about NodeJS not so much.",1437292037

And that&#x27;s just basic stuff, not even considering setting up a database server or, heaven forbid, a cluster. Or anythging like redis, or a queuing system or redundant hardware.<p>That&#x27;s not nearly a comprehensive list, but I think my point is made.<p>It&#x27;s true that generally web dev is less mathy.

The people who say or think otherwise usually just don&#x27;t know any better.<p>That being said, there are different tiers of software development (including web development) in general. Most developers are actually abysmal at architecting good software. This might be down to a number of things - time pressure, lack of experience, lack of skill, apathy, &quot;life happens&quot; etc.<p>Anyway my point is, abysmal software is everywhere. Thankfully, customers don&#x27;t mind. If your software is important, you&#x27;ll write tests.",1437289471

Spacecraft technology always seems outdated because of the lead times required: on something like New Horizons, it&#x27;s between 15 and 20 years from component design to being used for its primary mission.<p>In addition, as another commenter noted, the reference oscillator is used for REX (the radiometry experiment on board New Horizons) and quality of gathered measurements for this experiment was one of the primary needs here: being able to use the component for the communications subsystem is just good power/mass engineering at work.",1437289343

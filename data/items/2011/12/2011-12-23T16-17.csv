The least intuitive and most important thing I learned each time was that there are many wonderful options available but you have to find them. Once you do, it's amazing how much easier things get for everybody involved.<p>There are many levels of care available between intensive care and hospice and plenty of funding available to pay for almost all of them if you look hard enough. Sadly, OP mentions none of this. What an unhelpful article.<p>There is part-time home health care, full-time home health care, assisted living, nursing homes with multiple levels of appropriate care, and multiple levels of hospice care. (Six days to live or you're not accepted? Shame on them. What kind of thing is that to put caregivers through?)<p>There is also tons of ""care for the caregiver"" which is indispensable. I don't how I would have made it without that.<p>Most importantly, I can't say enough for all of the wonderful people who cared for my loved ones, in many ways much better than I ever could have. They're out there, dedicating their lives to make this inevitable transition better for everyone.<p>Theresa Brown, I suggest a follow-up ""how to"" article for caregivers. Unlike this piece, that would take a little research, but could be your contribution to this difficult, but easily addressed problem. You could make it the piece I wish I had read instead of figuring it out myself at the worst moment of my life. Please use the resources of the New York Times to finish the work you've barely started here.",1324659584

3386232,comment,3385596,3385596,10,0,kamaal,,,"The problem:<p>As it is mentioned in the email. People tend to believe, being great is about knowing a lot of facts and stuff from memory. Having information about stuff others don't know. While the fact is intelligence and knowledge only acts as catalyst in the path to success. They are not success or don't lead to success in themselves. Unless you don't understand this you will keep wondering why you are not getting successful while some guy you consider mediocre is winning.<p>What matters in real world is productivity. Ability to discover things quickly. Learn quickly. Learn to understand and properly state problems. Search for solutions quickly. And then use the best tools at disposal to build things in as little time with acceptable quality in the problem domain. Intelligence and knowledge of facts in this system at maximum fastens your rate of success nothing more nothing less. But yes practice helps. But practice in the right areas.<p>If you believe reading algorithm and data structures text books and searching for puzzles online will make you a good programmer, then I'm not sure. It may prepare you for interviews, it may also get you a job a bit web giant. It may make you look super intelligent in front of a panel or your team. But in terms of producing software for solving business problems, those facts from memory and even their practice at maximum serves as a catalyst not a crucial ingredient to success.<p>Apart from practicing writing programs. Learning API's, best practices, tools, techniques and your other usual day to day programming tasks. You also need to practice to be a better team player, you need to learn design, you need to learn customer interaction skills, you need to learn how to gather requirements.<p>You need to learn how to manage resources - time, money and people effectively. You need to learn effective ways of running software teams.  The list goes endless.<p>Its no longer ""Can write awesome code"" == ""Success"". There are a gazillion parameters that will decide you success. And programming is just one of many of them.<p>Here is the shocker. You don't really a 1000 years of life to give 10 years to each. And even if you had a 1000 years of life you would be bored of giving 10 years to each and you would keep forgetting what you did decades back.<p>So, just be more productive and iterate your work endlessly. Find flaws and fix them. Do it in iterations. You will be taken care of.",1324659297

3386172,comment,3382927,3385568,1,0,ImprovedSilence,,,"I think there is a different angle to look at this whole ""99% vs 1%"" thing.  One must be careful not to take the 1%v99% too literally.  I think much of the Occupy anger is (or at least should be) directed towards people who have used questionable methods to obtain and maintain their wealth (more on that in a minute.)  The disparity isn't against the creators, individuals like Louis C.K. who have produced something of value and has earned profit because many others have been willing to trade money for the entertainment he provides.  That's pure capitalism, exactly how it should work, and he shouldn't be excessively taxed.  Also one must keep in mind that income tax (which is how Louis will be taxed) and capital gains tax are two very different beasts.<p>Now on to the ""1%"" Occupy is mad about. Now the problem we have here with some of the larger corporations and individuals, is that they are in a position to better be able to ""game"" the system.  Using the ""double Irish""and the ""Dutch sandwich"" to bring the corporate tax rate to effectively 0%.  Bankers making, well, bank.  I recommend reading this rather enlightening article about Goldman: <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-great-american-bubble-machine-20100405"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-great-american...</a><p>We as people on both sides of the 99% vs. the 1% debate, must develop an understanding of Capitalism vs. Corporatism, as I believe there are many many people with an over simplified view of capitalism, who are duped into supporting whole heatedly ""corporatism"", under that guise that what you are supporting is, in fact, capitalism.  Capitalism=good, corporatism=bad, but don't let somebody sell you corporatism under the guise of sweet sweet capitalism.  Capitalism is what Louis C.K. does. Corporatism is what Goldman Sachs does.<p>About the wall street traders.  They say the service the provide to society is making the markets more liquid.  To a degree they are right, but if taken too far, it can spiral out of hand, and lead to a tragedy of the commons if no-one keeps them in check.  allow me to explain.  Many day traders don't make money by ""investing"" as you or I would in our 401k or what have you.  We like to pick companies, hope they grow long term, and make some profit for us.  If you're a sell side day trader, you make money on trades, not investments.  Your profit is in the margins, the fractions of pennies of made by the banks when trades take place.  This means you profit the most when lots of trades happen.  When do lots of trades happen?  When the market goes up real fast, and down real fast.  I think traders have systematically (if unconsciously) learned this, and make money by skimming pennies off our investments.  This should allowable (to a degree) as it goes back to the providing liquidity to the markets thing.  But it can often go too far.  Now, are they providing something of value, or just taking our value, and should they be taxed accordingly?  Not to mention the seemingly revolving door between wall street and it's govt regulators.  There is clearly something afoot, and we the people are left in the dark.",1324658104

They want to just write something fresh. But when we've invested in a system as large as this, we're not just going to scrap it. The crux of the problem is that they want to create and own their own application.

When that array filled up I did some research and decided to just go the mdadm route and have minimal complaints so far.   I use the 3-ware array still for ""critical data"" and back it up to S3.<p>Monitoring: You have to work a bit more to get proper alerting of issues from mdadm but its not hard to setup.  Doesn't matter for me much, i sit in the same room as this server most of the day working so if something goes wrong i generally notice before i get the e-mail.<p>Performance:  As mentioned I'm using Green drives, this system wasn't built with speed in mind but rather large amounts of nearline storage.  Never-the-less, with some basic tweaking and making sure the array's partition alignment is correct I get around 450MB/sec read speed and ~85MB/sec write long term, I have the system setup to cache writes aggressively however as most of the data on this array isn't critical and its on a UPS, what this means is that writes under a few gigabytes usually complete at wire speed (~200MB/sec) then get flushed to the disk later.  Most of the time I'm limited by network bandwidth to this system, unless I'm writing a very large amount of data all at once.<p>One negative is rebuild speed, here i'm very limited by the 'Green' drives I believe.  It runs at about 50MB/sec so rebuilds do take awhile.<p>As far as CPU usage goes, I've never seen it be the limiter but haven't watched it that closely, it doesn't peg during rebuild.  This machine acts as an SMB/NFS file server and a few development VMs 24/7 (database, and a couple other things) and I've never really had an issue with cpu usage.<p>One really nice bonus is that if something in the system fails, you can just plug the drives of your array into to almost any other linux system:<p>apt-get install mdadm<p>mdadm --assemble --scan<p>Poof, working array.<p>tl;dr<p>If your going after 1GB/sec transfer speeds, get a high end raid card.<p>If you just need some large redundant storage that can saturate a Gbit link or 2, then mdadm software RAID is just fine IMO.",1324656779

But palliative care that shortens life (e.g., narcotics) is fine, as is passive euthanasia.<p>The biggest problem I see here is that unless the patient expresses a clear desire to end treatment (either in the moment or via legal documents prepared in advance) then medical professionals must continue to treat. I think the that's a fine way to run things, but it means Americans <i>must</i> be very clear about what they want if they are to avoid dramatic interventions that may do very little to help them and certainly are scarring for the family.",1324656538

The # of linux servers, which don't care about boot time (or where software init is a very tiny part of boot time anyway) is way larger than the number of people using it as a desktop.  Boot time isn't the thing that's keeping linux off the desktop.<p>Rewriting scripts and rolling them into a C daemon defeats the whole point of scripts in the first place - the administrator of the system can't make quick changes or easily troubleshoot things (or, optionally, selectively enable/disable small sections of initialization).  It's also a large amount of new work for folks busy fixing actual broken or buggy parts of their software.<p>Lennart complains that the starting PID on his linux desktop is too high, because init scripts call 'grep', 'awk', etc. - and that developers should rewrite all of that into their own startup daemons.  It seems like he's complaining about the 'UNIX way' of small, text-oriented tools each doing one job and piping the results between them for flexibility and power for the the system administrator.  Moving all of that into a C-based daemon, hiding it entirely from the administrator (short of a unsupported-by-your-contract recompile and source mod) doesn't seem like a net win for me, especially for a few seconds saved two or three times a year.<p>Most scary is the way he wants to handle socket based services - it's already the source of one remote DOS against a machine running systemd:\n<a href=""https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=739538"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=739538</a>",1324656454

6872497,comment,6867503,6869093,1,0,chetanahuja,,,"US telecom market is mostly a duopoly (AT&T + Verizon) with sprint and Tmobile fighting at the margins. Combine with a profoundly uneducated user-base (when it comes to phone technologies) makes the job of the numerous MVNO&#x27;s (straight-talk/simple-mobile etc.) much harder. Most people I know, even many who work in the tech industry, don&#x27;t quite understand the concept of buying a device and a carrier plan as separate things.<p>This situation is not helped by the fact that the carriers have steadfastly refused to standardize on wireless technologies. Even the two GSM carriers (AT&T and T-mobile) have never agreed on the same set of frequencies for data... so eg., AT&T HS(D)P(+) devices (e.g. Galaxy Nexus, iPhone 4) didn&#x27;t quite work on T-mobile and vice-versa. The regulatory agency (FCC) has basically been either helpless or complicit and maintaining the status quo.<p>Things might get a bit more competitive with LTE (with more standardized hardware etc.) but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any incentives for the big carriers to stop this effective collusion to start a price war. T-mobile seems to be breaking ranks in some ways but I haven&#x27;t really seen a pricing strategy designed to pull the crowds yet even from them.",1386554190

I compared the runtime of a perl script versus shell doing pretty much the same thing, and perl was much faster because there was significantly less fork/exec going on.<p>Sure the executable is say 70k versus dunno 5 megs for perl lets say. In the end, if you&#x27;re that constrained for memory, you should be using c not shell or even perl.<p>My aversion to shell is more related to finding, and eventually having to support, 20k shell &quot;programs&quot;. They are inevitably always brittle creations with no tests or even design philosophy behind them. They nominally were cobbled together to fill a niche. From which I&#x27;m impressed they work, but inevitably they fall on their own petard. I&#x27;ve rewritten most of them with some scripting language and reduced their complexity by orders of magnitude and made them easier to use as well as orders of magnitude faster. Stream/pipe processing isn&#x27;t the only way to skin some cats, despite its simplicity.<p>I guess I just find the &quot;I know i&#x27;ll use shell&quot; behavior to really really end up being its own detriment in later use. Shell may be turing complete but things like spaces for example really make using it easily and simply very much a losing proposition compared to say tcl.<p>I&#x27;m not against shell, its a great glue language, but it just seems to get over used in some domains.<p>Eh, time to go drink I&#x27;m rambling aimlessly now.",1386553865

I plant some seeds, take care of them, harvest the grains, and then sell them.  My capital is whatever seeds I planted, and the labour I used to raise them, then harvest them.  What I get paid is my revenue, and the amount of money that I&#x27;m compensated that goes beyond the minimum required to produce my goods is my profit.

419271,comment,418835,418835,0,0,pmarsh,,,"Unfortunately my main site hasn't given me an excuse to tinker with the setup, so I'm going to ask here.<p>Right now I use Apache 2.2.x in front of a pack of Mongrels and mod_cache is enabled to cache content based on Expires headers. (I tried Passenger over the summer but it still had issues at the time).<p>Now with mod_cache, mod_proxy_balancer and my mongrels I have a very stable setup with only two programs. What sort of benefit would there be to using nginx and say varnishd along with mongrels?<p>I know varnish is a much more flexible cache than mod_cache, but would there really be a performance boost of any note?",1231083004

419267,comment,418672,418672,0,0,Andi,,,"It's all a question about the correct precodition definition. I think people who heard about conditional probability know that the correct answer is ""2/3"". Most people will just imagine the first precondition ""they have two children"" and forget the second one.<p>What about going in the opposite direction and simply ask ""What is the probability that a mother has a boy and a girl?"" I think many people would answer ""1/2"", too, simply adding the precodition ""she has 2 children"" ;)<p>The origin for this is - I think - an implicit context people are thinking of without real awareness of it. You think quicker with implicit context.",1231082838

419259,comment,419060,419060,0,0,mixmax,,,"<i>Simplicity is complex.</i> - gold qoute...<p>I did a redesign for a major site that sells to consumers two years ago, and we focused intensely on usability, particulraly the flow from ordering a product to checking out and paying. The result was an immediate jump in turnover of 25%. And this was without A/B splittesting which would probably have gotten the number even higher.<p>Usability is pretty hard, but it's unbelievably rewarding - I'm constantly amazed that a lot of people don't take it more seriously.",1231082055

The second is to entrust the company to my family in case I die, so that they can sell it if something happens to me.<p>Re: desktop vs. web, yes it's a surprise, but as I say above, a desktop app which syncs to the web is a pretty good proposition...we'll see more as I build my ""web connectors"" this year.",1231081430

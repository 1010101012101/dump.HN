The two had concluded that detectable \n   signatures could be minimized utilizing a shape composed \n   of the smallest number of properly orientated flat \n   panels. In addition, Schroeder believed that it was \n   possible to develop and resolve a mathematical equation \n   capable of calculating analytically, the reflection from \n   a triangular flat panel; this in turn he hypothesized \n   could be applied in a calculation relating to RCS. \n   Overholser had hired his former boss out of retirement \n   and as Schroeder's mathematical computations became \n   available, Overholser and his team of two engineers were \n   able to use these to write the computer program that \n   could evaluate the RCS of prospective design submissions \n   nominated by Dick Scherrer and his group of preliminary \n   design engineers. Derys and his team worked night and \n   day, and in just five weeks produced an RCS prediction \n   program known as 'Echo 1'. The resultant model was a \n   faceted delta wing design which had more than its share \n   of skeptics within the Skunk Works, some in aerodynamics \n   referring to the shape as 'the Hopeless Diamond'.\n</code></pre>\n[Edit: Fact check]",1290567759

When you want to tidy your todo list up just do 'todone-archive'. To look back at what you've achieved and when, just do 'todone-view'.

3603100,comment,3602957,3602957,1,0,alizaki,,,"Wrong. Social games are not regular media. What is a media company? Media companies deal in information - it could be the news, analysis, up-to-the-second stock information or celebrity photographs. Media companies battle comodotization and charge through ads or subscriptions of some sort. Game (traditional) companies are like studios. You build something (you think) people want, market it and boom, you make money. Once someone buys your box/downloads your game on Steam, you're only concerned with how long they play (i.e. amount of fun they have) in the context of the sequel. As with movies and music, there are indie surprises (exceptions which prove the rule).<p>Social games companies (and many of the apps) only gets paid when people actually play their games (I'm simplifying this, because a lot of other factors add in, e.g. geography. But it's more of less true.). This is why they measure revenue by DAU (daily active users). You can bring this engagement around by analytics, behavioral science (social compulsion) or by making a damn good game, any which way you want. But you're in the business of making consumable experience which leave the user wanting more eventually. So social games have more in common with the drug trade than media companies/traditional games.",1329483178

An overwhelming majority of hackers, geeks and guys working in IT are so absolutely alright and wonderful to deal and hang out with and I cannot reconcile the average hacker with discriminating against women, this simply doesn't fit. On top of that most hackers will be so happy to have a chance to have girls around in an industry that seems to draw more than 90% men... look, it's not like we try to keep you gals out or anything, it's just that so many girls aren't even remotely interested in the strange things we do and of the ones who are interested still quite many don't make it through the programming courses in university then - or at least this has been my experience. The image of the hacker and our profession is definitely changing to the better nowadays, so there is something to look forward to. In my experience the average office full of true hackers is a wonderful place to work, no back-stabbing, friendly positive atmosphere and lots of fun to be had.<p>And I never had the impression that hacker gals actually get paid less for the same position, at least not in the IT industry?

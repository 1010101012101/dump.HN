7842095,comment,7841736,7841838,3,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> I can&#x27;t think of a single way where this hurts the consumer<p>You already listed it, and without even thinking about it described why it&#x27;s such a serious problem:<p>> I can&#x27;t just play the video on any device (although it&#x27;s hard nowadays to find a device that doesn&#x27;t have Netflix playback)<p>Suppose that I want a device I can verify. The reasons for this have nothing to do with movies. I just want to know that the device I&#x27;m using for my business doesn&#x27;t have a backdoor put there e.g. by the Chinese government or any other government or corporation when it was manufactured. I want to know nobody has access to my trade secrets, so I want to be able to verify the device myself, or be secure in the knowledge that someone I trust has verified it and that anyone can who wants to.<p>This should have nothing to do with movies. I don&#x27;t care whether or not anybody else wants to watch Batman on their iPad, I just want to look at all the bits I paid for and be able to change them as I please.<p>But if somebody releases a device I can verify, that device would be incompatible with DRM, because DRM can&#x27;t withstand transparency. And devices have network effects. Hence why &quot;it&#x27;s hard nowadays to find a device that doesn&#x27;t have Netflix playback&quot; -- because having Netflix creates more sales for a device than being approved by neckbeards, so the manufacturers all respond to the market. Anyone who tolerates DRM is making everyone less secure.<p>And it&#x27;s even worse than that, because it&#x27;s not just that you can&#x27;t verify a device with DRM. You also can&#x27;t <i>make</i> a device with DRM. If you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in the black box then you can&#x27;t reproduce it. The only way a system gets DRM is if Netflix et al will do the work, which they don&#x27;t do for anything without enough existing market share. And how is a system supposed to get any market share if it can&#x27;t display any content? This is why <i>Microsoft</i> likes DRM. It destroys the ability of newcomers to enter the market. That&#x27;s the real consumer harm. Can you imagine what the landscape would have looked like if Microsoft had &quot;provided&quot; DRM for images and web pages in the 90s? No Firefox and no iPhone.",1401821922

The software I write is mostly used for internal research, so it&#x27;s not going anywhere. It&#x27;s difference between getting compilation errors from &#x27;make&#x27; or having to pull them out of the OpenCL C API at runtime. Setting a breakpoint in an OpenCL kernel... I remember Intel&#x27;s stuff basically working fine, but you had to pass a vendor-specific option to hint at the file path. In all these little ways, the workflow is just sucky. Much of it can be worked around, but I&#x27;m too lazy to write more application code to do all the chores that the CUDA toolchain takes care of already. I&#x27;m glad to hear that 2.0 is fixing this.<p>What&#x27;s your alternative to templates for generic code, exactly? C macros? Scripted pre-processing that further screws up the already marginal tool support for debugging and profiling? Copy+paste? Templates are completely orthogonal to &quot;complex computation&quot; -- I just want to use a device function on different data types without run-time overhead.<p>On the topic of complex computation, I&#x27;m constantly surprised at the kind of features NV adds to CUDA and how well they actually work. I&#x27;m also surprised at the kinds of things people do on the hardware. If someone implements a high performance lock-free data structure on the GPU, you can&#x27;t look at that and say oh, that&#x27;s too complex, you shouldn&#x27;t do that.<p>Also, until we&#x27;re all working on computers that look like the PS4 with a unified global memory, there&#x27;s a huge incentive to cram the awkward bits of your program onto the GPU any way you can, even if it drags a bit, because that&#x27;s where the data is.<p>NVIDIA has really gone to some extremes. malloc in device functions. vtable support. Dynamic parallelism. Metal has none of this stuff.<p><EDIT: Just now saw your other replies downthread.

They are of course domain-specific but it is possible.<p>i haven&#x27;t looked into either of your links in detail, but with the various BLAS/LAPACK libraries that exist, which are also far more mature (and more widely used), would almost certainly be a better choice. lots of these already work on GPUs and are optimized to death by beings who think in assembly.. most of them are in fortran, as well (although they have front ends for several languages).",1401819882

A few other (amazing) people started contributing in earnest late in 2011, and it became a major focus for the Apple Developer Tools group in July 2013.\nThe Swift language is the product of tireless effort from a team of language experts, documentation gurus, compiler optimization ninjas, and an incredibly important internal dogfooding group who provided feedback to help refine and battle-test ideas. Of course, it also greatly benefited from the experiences hard-won by many other languages in the field, drawing ideas from Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, C#, CLU, and far too many others to list.&quot;<p>- Chris Lattner, <a href=""http://nondot.org/sabre/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nondot.org/sabre/</a>",1401819826

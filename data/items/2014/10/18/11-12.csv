And because being <i>actually</i> poor (e.g. being raised in a poor family, lacking a reasonable level of education, having bad job prospects (no chance of career advancement), working three crappy jobs to barely sustain your household without being able to put any money aside, and so on) carries a lot of stigma, poor people tend to be more self-conscious about how poor they appear to their peers (especially peers that <i>do</i> buy expensive crap even if they have to sign this kind of bullshit contracts).<p>There&#x27;s also a distinct difference between being poor as a student or entrepreneur (because being poor is just a temporary thing and it&#x27;s seen as a temporary sacrifice) versus being poor as a regular part of the workforce (why don&#x27;t you just save some of the money or work more?) or unemployed (why aren&#x27;t you working?) or even long-term unemployed (why haven&#x27;t you been working? or from the employer side: there must obviously be something wrong with you or else you would have been working).",1413631264

Not sure how I feel about this rationale.  If I were the <i>other</i> guy in this equation, I&#x27;d be pissed if I was making the same contribution as someone else, but got paid less because the other guy &quot;needed it more&quot;.  Why am I being punished because I live within my means?<p>Maybe the response to, &quot;I need a higher salary because I have a large mortgage payment&quot;, should be, &quot;maybe you shouldn&#x27;t have bought a larger house than you could afford&quot;.<p>How about this: say this guy works at your company, and presents this rationale, and gets (takes?) his raise.  Then the other guy, who is (for the sake of the argument) exactly equal in experience and skill, and provides the same value to your company, steps up to the plate and says, &quot;I would like a raise as well, because I should make the same amount as someone who is my equal and peer&quot;.  Would the group agree with that?  I certainly hope so.  If I were that guy, I&#x27;d quit on the spot if not.<p>And this extends to other things as well:  one guy has 4 kids, the other has 2.  Kids can be expensive.  Does the first guy&#x27;s decision to have more kids make him more deserving of a higher salary than the other guy?<p>I could extend this to just about anything.  In the end, once you&#x27;re above the poverty line, your &quot;needs&quot; aren&#x27;t really based on anything rational or &quot;fair&quot;.  It&#x27;s really just what you <i>want</i>.  I&#x27;m not saying you shouldn&#x27;t try to get what you want, but suggesting that one person&#x27;s wants entitles them to a higher salary than someone who has more modest wants... well, that&#x27;s ridiculous to me.<p>This is actually a great example of one of the reasons why employers like to keep compensation secret.  If this hypothetical high-mortgage guy is that important to the company, you <i>want</i> to be able to give him more money if not doing so will cause him to quit, all without pissing off the other otherwise-equal guy with the now-lower salary.<p>So my thesis here, I guess, is that if you&#x27;re going to be transparent about compensation, that compensation must be based on measures as objective as you can make them.  Otherwise you have to keep compensation secret so you can make &quot;unfair&quot; deals with some employees as necessary, without pissing off other employees who don&#x27;t get such a good deal.<p>At any rate, I <i>do</i> think what you&#x27;re doing is a really cool (and brave!) experiment.  I hope it works out for you and your company, but I&#x27;m very much afraid that making personal needs a component of public compensation decisions will lead to others harboring resentment.",1413631024

And no rationalisations about cost and quality and long-term amortisations and whatnot, please.<p>Yes, poor people suck at managing their money. But at the same time the advertising industry focusses on them. A lot of price-based advertising relies on people not looking at it closely enough. Yay, free phones with mobile contracts. I can buy a new sofa for only $50/month (over the next ten years). This ringtone costs only 99 cents (if you subscribe for 3 ringtones per week at a cost of $2.97/week and all the ones you want are in different subscriptions and don&#x27;t forget the offer code you originally subscribed with or you&#x27;ll have a hard time cancelling the subscription when you notice it a month from now).<p>Our culture places a lot of emphasis on status symbols and wealth.

I&#x27;ve seen plenty of old widows in Germany be able to make do with welfare because they were used to not being able to afford anything (or even theoretically be able to buy anything if they had the money) throughout the post-war period, but we&#x27;re talking about people who&#x27;ve learned to cope in a situation where it was entirely possible to freeze or starve to death even if you did everything right. Luxury meant having a variety of food on the table (or having spare tobacco for your own use, rather than for trading), not being able to afford the latest iPhone.<p>I would also argue that HN necessarily isn&#x27;t representative of &quot;average folks&quot;. The average HN user <i>is</i> special. Not better, but different. There&#x27;s a disproportionate amount of entrepreneurs (yes, they are the <i>exception</i>) for example. Plus, there&#x27;s the survivor bias: if you&#x27;re here, you probably haven&#x27;t found it an impossible task to keep out of poverty (even if you ever were close to it). If you had, you wouldn&#x27;t be here in the first place.<p>But the entire point is moot anyway. If everyone is able to engage in some kind of critical thinking, self control and doing basic math, and still there are a lot of people trapped in these cut-throat contracts, the average person is <i>evidently</i> not sufficiently able to avoid them (and if those things are all it takes to do so, they are <i>evidently</i> not as good at them).<p>But I think this isn&#x27;t a question of facts, it&#x27;s a question of ideology: I think it&#x27;s our responsibility as a society to keep people out of situations where they become practically unable to act freely (even if they only have themselves to blame). You seem to hold the opinion that if they screw up their own lives, we have no obligation to help them and they only owe it to themselves.",1413630385

73786,comment,73674,73782,0,0,brk,,,"Good points.  But keep in mind that YC and typical Angel's bring some things of value like:<p>- Other high-level industry contacts
- Experience
- Proven track record.<p>How does the OP compare in those regards, because that is (IMO) what establishes value more than what your head count is in proportion to the rest of the company.",1193669616

73784,comment,73674,73674,0,0,sharpshoot,,,"You should value how much equity you deserve based upon your expected future value. Sure - you can crank out a prototype, but can you scale a development team, speak at a conference, provide 'non-obvious' contributions to the product? Can you hire other developers, make wide-ranging decisions about which technology platform to use or are you a sockpuppet? If you are hell bent on proving your value - what is your expected future value.

73782,comment,73674,73674,0,0,hugh,,,"Another way to think about it: let $x be the salary you could earn elsewhere, and N be the number of years you'd wind up working for free. It doesn't matter who you are, $Nx is a pretty substantial amount of money.<p>You're basically being asked to pay $Nx for 2% of a company at the ""two guys and an idea"" stage. That doesn't sound like much of a deal. If I were an angel investor I'd be wanting a much more substantial stake in the company for that kind of money. Even YC usually winds up with at least three times that, and they generally put in a lot less than whatever $Nx is.",1193668892
73781,comment,73609,73738,0,0,Goladus,,,"That seems accurate to me.  There is also another class of postponement you can apply for if you don't get a deferment, which is called a forbearance.  Generally it involves calling the loan servicer and asking nicely.  The main difference is that interest will still accrue with a forbearance.<p>Here's an example: <a href=""https://www.acs-education.com/CS/Jsp/loanoptions/ffelForbearance.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.acs-education.com/CS/Jsp/loanoptions/ffelForbear...</a><p>That one even has an online application form for the ""Financial hardship"" forbearance which is basically the ""I just don't feel like paying my loan right now"" option.",1193668869
73780,comment,73674,73775,0,0,brk,,,"Employee is a pretty loose term.  He is doing some work (coding) in return for something of assumed value (stock or options).  Just because he is not getting an actual paycheck does not necessarily mean that is not an employee of sorts.<p>There is also no mention of how much of a track record the OP has in terms of creating success.  Everyone is going on about how this is such a raw deal for him.  If he has no real wins on his resume, this could be a huge opportunity to create something that he can take a lot of credit for, and leverage that to either co-found his next venture, or join an early stage startup with the ability to demand a good overall package.<p>Sometimes you have to actually take a less-than-optimal deal to build up a platform under yourself from which you can shout your next requirements from.",1193668299

73775,comment,73674,73742,0,0,oditogre,,,">you are not an ""unofficial co-founder"". You are employee #1. Big difference.<p>If you're not getting paid, how are you an employee?  If your only compensation is equity, that means that you're putting as much on the line as the co-founders, with an equal level of odds of getting a return on your commitment.  In that case, your payout on the gamble should be, if not the same, at least comparable.  If they're unwilling to offer that, then there needs to be a fair salary from day 1.",1193666721

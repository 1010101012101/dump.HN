I don't care who you're meeting with, you should be holding or wearing the baby.<p>- if the baby fusses, don't hand her off to the nanny -- start nursing her or change her yourself, no matter who you're with.   You can still carry on a conversation with them, and you're powerful enough they have to pretend they're not offended -- they shouldn't be, anyways.<p>- invest in a standing desk and a sling.  Babies love to sleep in those things, and are usually quiet even when awake.  They'll be much more comfortable if you're standing rather than sitting, and it gives you the ability to rock them while working.<p>- have walking meetings.   Great for you, the baby and the participants.<p>- it's your partner's (or an employee's) job to make sure that you get a proper sleep at night.  The shorter the interruption at night, the easier it is to get back to sleep, and the less the interruption.   Your only job is to nurse.  It's your partner's job to pick up the baby when it cries, to soothe her and to change her.<p>If the baby is colicky, all bets are off.   But most babies aren't.<p>And this advice is only for the first 6 months or so.   By then the baby is much more awake & aware, and is probably better off in a nursery right next door.   Working at 6 months is fairly well travelled ground.<p>Very few women have the luxury of stopping all work when their baby arrives.   Heck, most of them don't even get 2 weeks off.

It depends on the publisher but they may also edit the manuscript; find the right reviewers; have a full time editor make a decision based on the reviewer's feedback; typeset or convert it to machine readable format (authors submit in Word, but this'll often be converted to an industry standard XML format to allow interoperability between different databases - both abstract databases and publisher ones as journals change publishers frequently); ensure the content is properly stored (this is not the same as putting it up on S3 for 2 cents a month. It's the scholarly record and publishers generally take the responsibility of maintaining it seriously. Publishers pay a fee to put content into a darknet run by a consortia of libraries - if the publisher goes out of business the consortia makes all the content available for free. They also pay membership fees to industry organizations like CrossRef that allow them to deposit canonical metadata in a central database and mint DOIs) and discoverable (at the end of the day your paper will get much more attention when published in Science than it does your blog).<p>Are all of those things worth paying more than $99 an article for? It's debatable.<p>But can anybody with a Wordpress blog do what publishers can? No.<p>(Same sort of thing applies to trade. Look at self-published books. You can create great content for free and stick it in an EPUB but you'll rapidly find that you need to start shelling out to be included in the book databases bricks and mortar stores use, to have a cover designed, to get an ISBN, to start actually selling through Amazon or wherever... publishing isn't as trivial as it seems.)",1342783592

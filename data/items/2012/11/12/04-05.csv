Pancake never really achieves better than 90 req/sec, and completely fails to handle high concurrency.<p>Remember, this is Apache and mod_php, which is renowned for being the slow and creaky way to run PHP.

It isn't that the long function name is OK, it is that it is poorly decomposed into tasks. But digging another ""why"" back, the root cause for that is what you say later, that it ""increases the overall complexity of the bookkeeping"" etc., and the reason for <i>that</i> is that C isn't really that good a language for abstraction. After 40 years of experience with it we've managed to create some best practices that carry it far further than anyone could have imagined at the beginning, but when it gets down to it, when you have a language that doesn't abstract very well, you do eventually end up paying the price in functions like that. It probably is the right answer in C, no sarcasm, but that's not the same thing as saying it's the right answer in a more general sense.<p>(And to be more concrete, C has poor facilities for composing abstractions together without complication and loss. On a feature-by-feature basis you can make it do pretty much anything you want, Turing Complete etc etc, which makes it hard to see in blog-post-sized examples, but they don't wire together very well.)",1352694541

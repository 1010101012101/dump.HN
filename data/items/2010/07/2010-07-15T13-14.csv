1517777,comment,1514688,1516053,0,0,stcredzero,,,"A problem with this discussion is that both ""fundamental"" and ""value"" are overloaded.  What I am asserting is that the commonsense notion of value is indeed real in this context, just that the market is disconnected from it.<p>When it comes down to it, there is such a thing as talent.  There is also something real called taste.  The tragedy is that it's often really difficult for this to be reflected in a market.  Perhaps a part of the problem is that talent is actually widespread: there is no distinct rare ""superstar"" talent, just lots of cute young women with a certain kind of look.  Therefore, there is no rarefied taste that can recognize the ""superstar.""<p>The valuation of personnel is also greatly complicated by all sorts of other factors.  A musician might have amazing chops, but the wrong kind of personality to deal with the rigors of touring or the temptations of stardom.<p>In essence, there are ""model analysts.""  In the article, they are called tastemakers.  They don't publish their conclusions, instead disseminating information at parties.  They are not necessarily paid directly for their analysis, but most certainly participate in a reputation market.<p>The takeaway is not that talent and taste do not exist.  They do exist.  It's that truly distinct ""superstars"" and the talent that can recognize them are something of a marketing fiction.  I agree that such markets are perpetual bubbles.  Because of this fact, they do more harm than good -- they act to cloud information to buyers and reduce access to resources.<p>Re: Trading -- knowing that certain kinds of markets are always bubbles points to certain trading strategies.",1279202047

Facebook offers a channel for me to communicate with my friends.  My friends and I supply the content, Facebook provides the pipes.  I, for one, don't mind that it's ad-supported; if they had a ""premium"" ad-free version for a small fee, I suppose I'd consider it, depending on the fee, but I can't say it would be a big priority.<p>I'm also not impressed by the argument about data portability:  <i>This is the equivalent of changing mobile service providers but not being able to call your friends.</i>
It's not, really.  It's more like the early days of the telephone (or email), where you could only communicate with those friends of yours who were already on the network.  Complaining about the lack of portability is more like complaining ""I am giving up my mobile phone.  Why can't my friends still call me?""",1279201963

1517671,comment,1517339,1517339,0,0,lrm242,,,"True high-frequency is very hard. Most of these guys got started in the
1999/2000 time frame and didn't have to deal with many of the start-up
issues that new entrants face. For example, just consider the data you
need to trade that quickly. Not only is the real-time feed expensive,
but if you want to source the data from the execution venue then you
have a lot of code to write. The amount of data is also quite large. For
example, the US equities market executes approximately 45 million trades
per day and there are about 700 million quotes per day, not including
the non-top of book quote activity in the various ECNs. I collect
between 2 and 4 GB of data per day, if you were to go direct to the
execution venues you'd be looking at >50 GB per day, probably.<p>So, anyway, the ""true"" high-frequency game is very tough today because
we're already 10+ years into it. The markets have changed and the edge
has gotten smaller, but there is still plently for a lowly individual
automated trader to scratch away at.<p>Instead of looking for millisecond opportunities, look for second or
minute opportunities. Go where the big guys can't because there isn't
enough capacity. Can you find an edge that, on average, keeps you in a
trade 30 seconds, for example? There's still plenty of alpha left, just
don't step onto their playground and expect to get onto the swing set.<p>A few practical notes:<p>* You need to look into unbundled or cost-plus commission structures.
  These fee structures charge a per share commission and pass through
  all fees and rebates from the executing venue. This is required to do
  any sort of size with reasonable cost.<p>* Most ""retail"" brokers are not sufficient for any sort of high-volume
  algorithmic trading. Interactive Brokers is barely ok if you are in
  any way interested in limit order trading because they have fairly
  large cancel fees for direct routed orders. If you're model doesn't
  rely heavily on strictly offering liquidity or you're ok with letting
  IB route your order then IB is ok and offers an unbundled commission
  structure. Lightspeed Trading and Lime Brokerage are two that cater to
  active individual and institutions.<p>* Data storage is a big deal. Effective storage of regular (evenly
  spaced) and irregular time series will require you to engineer
  something. There are commercial solutions, but you can't afford them.
  When you're dealing with high-volume intraday trading this is one of
  the first issues you'll face. How do you store, query, and manipulate
  data that includes 45 million new rows per day? The relational DBs
  fall apart pretty quickly and even if they didn't they won't give you
  the time series operations you need/want.<p>* Data feeds are expensive, but required. Look at DTN NxCore. It is a
  full market feed that will give you the best you can get w/o going
  direct to the exchange. Some brokers will give you access to raw
  exchange feeds, but you'll need to engineer feed handlers and a ticker
  plant for them. This is a non-trivial task, but not impossible. Once
  you've done that, you'll need to figure out how to get all that lovely
  data off your co-located server and back to your home base for
  analysis. Network engineering will be required because your broker
  doesn't want you pushing 10-20GB per day through their network
  connection, so you'll need a circuit from an on-premise carrier.<p>* The banks are players in HFT, but not the original or best. Most of
  the guys that started it are still independent. Look at GETCO, RGM
  Advisors, etc.<p>* Flash orders, what most folks in this thread are refering to when they
  say the exchange gives the HFT firm a first look, are no more. That
  edge existed, and I'm sure HFT took advantage, but no HFT firm was
  built on flash orders. When they started flash orders didn't exist.<p>It is possible to be a successful, independent, automated trader. It is
even possible to do it on a purely intraday, high-volume basis. Don't get caught up
in the hype of needing to be high-frequency or not.<p>---<p>EDIT: The other thing I forgot to mention is that naked sponsored access is likely going away. This is a near-requirement for ""true"" HFT. Any future regulation won't affect any of the existing players because they're all grown up now and most have their own broker/dealers. Some form of sponsored access will likely still exist, but pre-trade risk checks will probably be required and will therefore still leave you're broker between you and the market.",1279199904

I was always a little disappointed when I would see his blog title dimmed out in my RSS reader as I scrolled on to read things by less engaging bloggers. I think this is a side effect of Steve's blogging style: I feel like I know him personally because of the sheer amount of words he uses to communicate.<p>This post is a good reminder that these are <i>people</i> you're talking to online (yes, even the ""Internet famous""). They're just ordianry people who have the same feelings, needs, and wants as you. Things you say have real, tangible, even powerful effects in the real world. It's easy to forget that with all this virtual stuff in between.",1279199038

Last idea, Take a foreign language class.",1279198995

Good that he got help relatively quickly and seems better. But he should really IMNSHO stop playing guitar - typing all day is enough damage to the fingers.<p>Personally, tuba playing pushed me over the edge, and the only choice I had was to stop working with computers and start teaching.

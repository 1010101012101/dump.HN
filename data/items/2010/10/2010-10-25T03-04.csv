1828455,comment,1827928,1827928,0,0,mcmc,,,"It seems fine to just enable SSL everywhere. But indulge me for a second in thinking of alternate solutions.<p>Instead of sending a cookie, send a piece of javascript code (as part of the SSL-cloaked login handshake) that generates a new cookie for each request, and consider each new cookie in this sequence a ""one time use"" token. You can turn off SSL for subsequent requests and just use one of these new cookies each time to verify identity because an attacker won't have your cookie generator.<p>This javascript is really just an encryption key and algorithm, and if you implement it correctly, it should take quite some time for snoopers to reverse engineer the encryption key based on a sequence of one-time-use cookies.<p>Logistically, I suppose you would run into some trouble setting a new cookie for each request depending on how the page is loaded. For instance, if the user pastes a url into a new tab manually, then this system wouldn't have a chance to set the new cookie first.<p>However, I think you could architect a system that solves this. For instance, put the javascript token generator source in local storage. If a new page loads with an invalid key, that new page can just get the cookie generator code out of local storage and manually refresh the page's content by making a request with a valid token. This should be quick enough for most users not to notice, in the rare case that they circumvent the site's usual navigation.<p>A downside is obviously that the content itself is still not safe, but at least the account would be. Any thoughts?",1287979079

That's not to say they can't live mutually, but that certainly is not ""synonymous"". Period. Just the fact that people have agreed suggests he is delivering the emotion he intends to with his art.

By this- I mean I'm pretty sure you didn't grow up in Bedstuy. I certainly don't believe that relieves him of his poor judgement, but I hope it helps invoke some situational empathy.

Try moving the runningRequest = false into the fadeTo callback.<p>Also, .fadeTo() has a default queue of it's own.
You could also add .stop() like this:<p><pre><code>    $('#function').html(data).stop().fadeTo('fast',1);

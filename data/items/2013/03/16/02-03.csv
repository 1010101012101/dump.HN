Part of the problem, I realized while writing an initial response to you, is the split definitions of ""free time"". On the one hand, there is free time that we take because we find our performance declining, and so we stop our activity for efficiency reasons. And then there is free time that is really The Time. Free time of this sort is what life is all about, it is why we work.<p>My query was intended to refer to the second definition.<p>Neither of your objections have much to do with the first definition, and they do not satisfy me with regards to the second form of free time. If you consider the case of someone like a physicist, for whom their great love is also their form of achieving ""success"". For people of this type, and for ambitious people who discover fulfillment through worldly success, work is exactly the sort of activity that brings them happiness.<p>So perhaps that's the split. People of these types concern themselves with free time for efficiency, and the rest concern themselves with the second sort of free time.

But legislation is not required to be pre-certified as Constitutional before it is passed by Congress or signed by the President. This is probably a good thing, because otherwise it would be much more difficult to bring challenges on unforeseen grounds that manifested after the legislation had gone into force, and you'd have a legislative dictatorship.<p>As for the DoJ, my understanding is that as an executive branch agency it has the obligation to make the most of its power to execute the laws on behalf of Congress. The amount of discretion available to the Attorney-General varies from law to law; the executive can't just abdicate its own power.<p>Now, the Obama administration has filed briefs arguing that the Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional for the upcoming case in the Supreme Court. Isn't that the exact opposite of what I'm saying above, you might ask? My answer to that would be no, because in the meantime it is still implementing DOMA; for example, by forbidding gay couples to file taxes as a married couple even if they married under state law. If I were married to a partner of the same sex, and we filed a joint tax return, the IRS would write back and say 'you can't do that.' If I then sued the government, they would be obliged to defend the suit and stand up for DOMA until such time as the Supreme Court overturns it (if they ever do). The administration's brief to the Supreme is a non-binding policy suggestion about how the constitution should be interpreted, which the Justices may choose to ignore.

It is not in the power of one nation, however formidably armed, still less is it in the power of a small group of men, violent, ruthless men, who have always to cast their eyes back over their shoulders, to cramp and fetter the forward march of human destiny. The preponderant world forces are upon our side; they have but to be combined to be obeyed. We must arm. Britain must arm. America must arm. If, through an earnest desire for peace, we have placed ourselves at a disadvantage, we must make up for it by redoubled exertions, and, if necessary, by fortitude in suffering.<p>We shall, no doubt, arm. Britain, casting away the habits of centuries, will decree national service upon her citizens. The British people will stand erect, and will face whatever may be coming.<p>But arms - instrumentalities, as President Wilson called them - are not sufficient by themselves. We must add to them the power of ideas. People say we ought not to allow ourselves to be drawn into a theoretical antagonism between Nazidom and democracy; but the antagonism is here now. It is this very conflict of spiritual and moral ideas which gives the free countries a great part of their strength. You see these dictators on their pedestals, surrounded by the bayonets of their soldiers and the truncheons of their police. On all sides they are guarded by masses of armed men, cannons, aeroplanes, fortifications, and the like - they boast and vaunt themselves before the world, yet in their hearts there is unspoken fear. They are afraid of words and thoughts; words spoken abroad, thoughts stirring at home - all the more powerful because forbidden - terrify them. A little mouse of thought appears in the room, and even the mightiest potentates are thrown into panic. They make frantic efforts to bar our thoughts and words; they are afraid of the workings of the human mind. Cannons, airplanes, they can manufacture in large quantities; but how are they to quell the natural promptings of human nature, which after all these centuries of trial and progress has inherited a whole armoury of potent and indestructible knowledge?<p>Dictatorship - the fetish worship of one man - is a passing phase. A state of society where men may not speak their minds, where children denounce their parents to the police, where a business man or small shopkeeper ruins his competitor by telling tales about his private opinions; such a state of society cannot long endure if brought into contact with the healthy outside world. The light of civilised progress with its tolerances and co-operation, with its dignities and joys, has often in the past been blotted out. But I hold the belief that we have now at last got far enough ahead of barbarism to control it, and to avert it, if only we realise what is afoot and make up our minds in time. We shall do it in the end. But how much harder our toil for every day's delay!<p>Is this a call to war? Does anyone pretend that preparation for resistance to aggression is unleashing war? I declare it to be the sole guarantee of peace. We need the swift gathering of forces to confront not only military but moral aggression; the resolute and sober acceptance of their duty by the English-speaking peoples and by all the nations, great and small, who wish to walk with them. Their faithful and zealous comradeship would almost between night and morning clear the path of progress and banish from all our lives the fear which already darkens the sunlight to hundreds of millions of men.",1363399926

5384058,comment,5382279,5383303,1,0,javajosh,,,"There is an interesting twist here that relates to the reflexivity (reflexivity, that thing Soros likes to talk about) of the value of gold. Precious metals may start off being precious because they are rare and beautiful materials that are easily crafted into decorative shapes. Girls like it. Guys like it. But then, because it doesn't decay it's value increases because it starts to be used as a standard trading commodity! Because that pile of gold can be converted into a house or food for a year or a farm, etc. that pile of gold increases in value. Indeed, pretty quickly this reflexive value eclipses intrinsic value, to the point where the gold itself doesn't matter except as a placeholder.<p>We can then jump to fiat currency. The key question is: how much real wealth can that pile of fiat money be converted into? The details vary (e.g. you can negotiate a better price) but fundamentally the real-world convertibility of a currency requires a functional, working market: the US dollar is powerful because you can easily and stably convert it into a basket of real goods. Indeed, the sheer size of the US economy means that this basket is unusually independent of demand, and can meet essentially unlimited demand in real goods. I mean, you could probably buy $100M of US corn today and not have any real effect on the supply. (Yes, you could overwhelm almost any single commodity market with $36B. Luckily Bill Gates did not decide to blow it all on bottled Coke, otherwise the world would be totally without Coke for probably a good two weeks!)<p>It is the physical, political, social, and legal environment that defines the machinery with which money is converted into real goods. Indeed, one could even justify US geopolitical goals (which pretty much boil down to ""become invulnerable"") as making possible the ultimately stable marketplace, which further strengthens the currency.<p>The problems arise, of course, when the machinery itself becomes perverted. We can <i>define</i> market perversion as ""adversely affecting the machinery that converts money into real goods"". There are a wide variety of such perversions, ranging from patent trolling (which perverts the R&D market), to the increase in size and complexity of the legal system to the point where prosecution is itself punishment (which also dampens innovation and reduces risk taking). This is partly why it is important to have a healthy middle class and not have too much concentration of wealth: if wealth is concentrated enough, then the wealthy wed with the machinery, and the perversion becomes systematic. We already see that with telecom and the FCC, banks and the SEC.",1363399537

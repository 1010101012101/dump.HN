7946061,comment,7943365,7944159,2,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Yeah, I go back and forth on that one. The problem is that the key management is crucial. Slip up and lose your key and your data is toast. Obviously this also applies to Amazon, but they have more resources, better incentives, and one million times the operational experience with their key management system than I&#x27;ll ever have with mine. Frankly, my clients should bet on them over me.<p>Now, one good idea might be to redundantly back-up Amazon&#x27;s backups at some other host, using GPG to encrypt those. This ensures against Amazon encryption errors, billing errors, mistyped legal injunctions, Jeff Bezos declaring you his personal enemy, et cetera.<p>This may be obvious, but rolling my own at-rest encryption is not going to significantly protect my data from an attacker who works inside Amazon, nor from an attacker who roots my instance. If the keys are in the cloud, the keys are in the cloud.<p>UPDATE: oh, yeah, I forgot the use case where you are writing to s3 from outside Amazon&#x27;s datacenter over HTTPS. Okay, that is a much stronger case for GPG in advance. It wouldn&#x27;t matter if we assumed that TLS always worked. But this is TLS. Does your upload client check the certificate chain? So many of them do not. I sure hope Amazon&#x27;s CLI client does.....",1403722723

7945975,comment,7944024,7944703,8,0,thucydides,,,"I practice law elsewhere, but if I were a lawyer for the NSA, I would be scared after reading this opinion. Some of its reasoning about cell phones is directly applicable to the NSA&#x27;s reported invasions of Americans&#x27; cell phones, indefinite collection of all Americans&#x27; call logs, and other matters. Admittedly, the Court tends to defer more to the executive branch in national security contexts than in criminal ones like this, but this opinion is ominous for some of the NSA&#x27;s surveillance programs. In some places, the opinion&#x27;s discussion of the inherent intrusiveness of cell phone searches reads very much like Judge Leon&#x27;s rejection of the NSA&#x27;s phone metadata collection program from December 2013 (<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/JudgeLeonNSAopinion12162013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/JudgeLeonNS...</a>).<p>And it&#x27;s ominous for the NSA not just because the reasoning is directly applicable to some NSA programs, it&#x27;s also that all 9 Justices signed on to an opinion that is more than assertive; it is scathing and sarcastic. E.g., Justice Roberts mocks the government for calling a cell phone search &#x27;materially indistinguishable&#x27; from a search of a wallet, purse, or address book. That is &quot;like saying a ride on horseback is materially indistinguishable from a flight to the moon&quot; (p. 17).<p>This line alone would make an NSA lawyer blanch: &quot;We cannot deny that our decision today will have an impact on the ability of law enforcement to combat crime... Privacy comes at a cost&quot; (p. 25). NSA lawyers should be seriously concerned that in the criminal context, the Court unanimously announced a broad rule that the government almost always needs a warrant to search even an <i>arrestee&#x27;s</i> cell phone - and then blithely dismissed the government&#x27;s arguments about the after-effects of such a rule, saying, &quot;Oh well, privacy comes at a cost.&quot;",1403722079

I am defining &quot;free will&quot; as the property that makes people moral agents --- ie. able to do otherwise in such a way that features in (some peoples&#x27;) moral judgements. I am not claiming that we in fact possess this property (I think that&#x27;s an open question).</i><p>My point is that all conceivable systems of human morality are equally incapable of distinguishing between humans that possess &quot;the property that makes them moral agents&quot; and those that do not. If the universe is deterministic, then human morality is just another link in the chain. Morality cannot address the fundamental nature of our choices because it exists in a system where the only available input are the consequences of and the perceived motivations for human behaviors. Hitler didn&#x27;t accidentally slaughter European Jews, his hateful feelings and aspirations for power drove him to towards those actions, even if he didn&#x27;t <i>choose</i> to be hateful and power hungry. The state of determinism does not modify the criteria for moral judgement.<p><i>Imagine you&#x27;re trying to understand a codebase with as much legacy baggage as human thought. You do so by identifying modules, finding out what depends on each one and what it depends on, testing and later maybe improving on it, or discarding it. Free will is one of those modules and before we try to &#x27;fix&#x27; it, we need to know what it does.</i><p>In that analogy, I don&#x27;t think you can describe free will as a module, contemplating free will is more like asking &quot;is the x86 instruction set etched into the processor or is there a homunculus living in the chip that reads incoming instructions and executes them appropriately&quot;. The answer to that question has no bearing on whether or not we judge the &quot;human thought program&quot; to be malware (e.g. for corrupting the memory space of another program), what we do is first decide &quot;what was the intention of this program?&quot; and then assess if the memory corruption is a bug or the program&#x27;s intentionally destructive payload.

Enterprise distros have reproducible builds on automated systems with chroots that contain only what the package needs, no network access and sometimes the build happens inside a virtual machine. Its is almost ridiculous how after maven forgot the topic of being &quot;offline&quot; almost every tool released afterward has done the same mistake.<p>Understand that Linux distributions sell support and that means being able to rebuild a patched version of a failed package. So whatever dependencies are pinned in Cargo.toml or Gemfile is irrelevant. The OS maker will override them as a result of testing, patching or simply to share one dependency across multiple packages. Distros can&#x27;t afford having one package per git revision used on a popular distro and then afford to fix the same security issue in all of them.<p>So having &quot;cargo build&quot; be able to override dependencies and instead look on the installed libraries with a command line switch or env variable helps the packager not having to rewrite the Cargo.toml in the package recipe.<p>Maven was probably the first tool that made packaging almost impossible and completely ignored the use-case of patching a component of the chain and be able to rebuild it completely.<p>Semantic versioning is great news, because it allows you to replace the dependencies for a common semantic version (not exactly the same).<p>For integrating with the C libraries not much needs to be done.

One is designers wanting to be creative and innovative (which is a top-down directive) without also talking with their counterparts in other areas of the company.  This will get corrected over time; periodically the company tries to line up all of its products so that they&#x27;re consistent across all of Google.  The last major such project was Kennedy; Quantum is the next one, so I suspect Android G+ will eventually change to conform with the Quantum styleguides just announced.<p>The other effect is that design rules are different for big companies than they are for small app developers.  Small app developers want to fit in with the platform styleguides, because they face intense competition, are only a tiny part of the total ecosystem, and so if they deviate from the expected UI it only harms themselves.  Big companies want to <i>set</i> the standards, and so they encourage their designers to be bold and adventurous, in the hopes of creating the trends.  And the Android G+ app has been a trendsetter in the past; some of the recent move towards very image-heavy apps (across both web and mobile) was pioneered by them back around 2011 and 2012.",1403719981

7945658,comment,7944655,7944655,4,0,Paul_Dessert,,,"While posting your prices may seem like a good idea, I&#x27;d recommend not doing it in most cases. I say most cases, because I think it depends on the type of client you&#x27;re going after.<p>In my experience, most clients that actually pay a fair amount of money are those that understand what their getting into. These clients understand that they&#x27;ll be forking out $20k - $40k for a project. So, in these cases, posting prices is irrelevant. They just want the best person for the job. Your sales challenge will be elsewhere.<p>Now, if you&#x27;re targeting the mom and pops in town and their average budget is $2k, then posting your price MIGHT help. BUT, this is simply a race to the bottom. If your rate for a project is $2k, but a competitor will do it for $1.5k, who will the budget minded client choose? Based off of the price alone, you&#x27;ve just scared away the client. You probably won&#x27;t even get the opportunity of an in-person meeting.<p>Bottom line, choose your clients carefully. If they pick you because you&#x27;re the cheapest, you might have bigger problems ahead of you...",1403719277

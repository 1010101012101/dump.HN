We already have first-world countries with medical technology that allows its citizens to live an average lifespan much longer than those in countries where such tech is unavailable.  Not to mention the everyday technologies that indirectly extend &quot;effective&quot; lifespan -- every hour not spent gathering cooking fuel, preparing food, washing clothes, etc. is an hour you can spend &quot;living&quot;.  Even in said first-world countries, there is a dichotomy: those who are rich & influential enough to take advantage of expensive & cutting-edge medical treatment, and those who are not.<p>Actual life extension therapies are just the above, writ large.  I don&#x27;t see any difference between this tech and any other &quot;early adopter&quot; tech, which is always expensive and limited in availability.  We can only hope that such technology will become cheaper & more widespread and trickle down to the rest of us in time for us to make use of it.",1379570362

Leaving Korea in a state of complete anarchy until they somehow sorted things out?<p>The Allies destroyed whatever government Korea had. Without someone to step in to keep the roads maintained, the local cops on their beat, and the courts running, the country would have otherwise collapsed. So of course you step in and try to set up elections so the people in the country can vote in a new constitution and a new government, and then you leave. Unless you&#x27;re Stalin, in which case you pick some crazy guy, install him as a dictator, and call the country a &quot;Democratic People&#x27;s Republic&quot; to make it look legitimate.

I&#x27;m sure WhatsApp could find a way to monetise them, or just leverage them for network effect. WhatsApp is a lightweight replacement for text messages, not a full-blown social network. You pay a buck, you get free text messages, not unending trickery to overcome your privacy options. I have WhatsApp contacts worldwide, so even if some countries reduce their usage there&#x27;s benefit in sticking with it. For $100 I&#x27;d stop using it.

Yes, engineers make more outside of the game industry, but if you look at average salaries for engineers it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> much lower. That $84K number includes, artists, designers, QA and producers.

When you compare against top tier companies we&#x27;re looking at a $20K+ jump.  But if you start comparing against top tier game developers like Valve, Riot or Naughty Dog you get comparable results.<p>I know that salary surveys are understandably taken with a grain of salt on HN, but I feel like it&#x27;s a better yardstick than the &quot;common wisdom&quot; that gets thrown around.",1379569962

All the various countries conquered by the Axis during World War II were occupied by various Allied powers with the intention of reestablishing them as independent countries. Poland and Czechoslovakia, to name two, were occupied solely by the Soviets and was set up as Soviet-controlled puppet states. Japan. to name another, was occupied solely by the United States and was reformed into a fairly pro-Western democratic country, complete with baseball.<p>Some countries were split into occupation zones between the Western allies and the Soviets. Germany was one. There were four occupation zones: British, American, French, and Soviet. The intention was for a new German government to be formed that would govern all four zones, but negotiations broke down and the Soviet occupied zone formed one government (German Democratic Republic, known as East Germany) and the Western occupied zones formed another (Federal Republic of Germany). This state of affairs continued until the fall of communism, when the East Germans more or less decided to join the Federal Republic giving us today&#x27;s Germany.<p>Korea was a similar case. There was no Korean government--it was a Japanese possession since 1910--so, with the intent of punishing Japan and giving the Korean people self-determination, it was temporarily occupied by the Allies until they could set up a democratic government. It was partitioned between the Soviets and the Americans, who, as in Germany, formed opposing governments. And then the North invaded the South--and that&#x27;s where the war began.",1379569227

Worth mentioning, is that we&#x27;re a pair programming shop and everyone on the team is a big fan of pairing all the time.<p>But it is loud as shit in the team room. We have a Spotify playlist constantly going in the background. When a BA passes a story for completion, this is signified by the ringing of a cowbell, at which point everyone will pound on their desk and play with noise makers to celebrate. That happens a few times a day. When a build breaks, a siren goes off and noises play from the build computer to let everyone know.<p>I think part of it might be the pair programming. Before I started pairing, I was a headphones kind of guy, too. I liked it quiet and I was easily distracted. But when you&#x27;re talking through a problem with your pair and you have someone to help keep you on task, it&#x27;s really easy to avoid being distracted.<p>I guess the point is, in the right culture and with the right personalities, open office can work really well.

This is possibly more important now that most software deployments are no longer happening on accessible data centers. Beyond that, open spaces provide an easier path to scaling engineering headcount, often in a Fred Brooks-ian sort of way.<p>To me, more than anything these decisions speak to the engineering or C level culture established within a business. If the talent feels the need to wear noise canceling headphones to function, then there is a problem that isn&#x27;t being addressed.<p>If a company is FORCED to implement this because they have decided to base their operations in an urban area with outrageous rent, then give the talent the flexibility to work offsite. If the management doesn&#x27;t trust their people enough with that degree of autonomy, well, I guess that&#x27;s a different discussion altogether.",1379567662

So every module and code interface was nutted out in detail and usually simplified. It seemed to keep a team of 12 developers focussed on building the same thing. A smaller wb was used to keep a simple list of what the teams working on.  Backed up by an open Plone intranet this brought us to delivery. Probably more suited to medium size teams as in game dev.  Part of the success was having done a prototype beforehand.<p>Whenever I see a w/b covered in those cute little pink and green post-it notes, my reaction is that they are embracing agile too rigidly - that the focus is 'process' not action. Its not a white board if theres nowhere to write, right?<p>So I think the main benefit is simply that the board, being blank, beckons you to draw whatever idea is bouncing around, which you then have to explain...",1237113905

The fact that you got it up just using the standard tools rather than reinventing the wheel shows remarkable restraint for a coder (wish I could stop reinventing wheels :( ).<p>Must look into blueprint, CSS frameworks seem to be the way to go.<p>Well done",1237113114

We had to build them. (and use them).<p>Naked GOTOs were indeed evil and led to endless loops and sleepless nights.  There was no structure to them.<p>Pascal was our savior.",1237112856

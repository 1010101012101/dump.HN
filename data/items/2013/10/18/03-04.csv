My 12 y.o. son was doing a project on seasons and climates, and he asked me whether it rains more in cold weather. And he gave me a certain line of reasoning.<p>Since real teaching moments can be hard to come by, I suggested we not stop there, but look at the data. Climate information is readily available on the internet, and we used Excel to plot out whether there were correlations.<p>Excel on its own has little value, but as a tool, it can make analysis painless and encourage people to form hypothesis and check them out quickly.",1382068703

Dose-response curves do not work that way. They do not look like binary circuits where at 10mcg they do absolutely nothing and then at 15mcg go to the moon. They look like curves. If 15 mcg was better than 12, then I should have observed something like a medium effect. If 20mcg was better than 12, I should have observed something like a small-medium effect. If 30mcg was best, I should have seen signs of a small effect, possibly not statistically-significant, but clear point-value shifts.

6569655,comment,6566602,6567946,1,0,jonnathanson,,,"They&#x27;ve got general consumer research from firms like Nielsen, which doesn&#x27;t really give you all that much insight into how a script will pan out. They&#x27;ve also got focus groups, and I mean that literally: network TV is one of the last great holdouts in abandoning the focus group. Focus groups are methodologically flawed for all sorts of reasons, and they&#x27;re <i>notorious</i> for mis-predicting hit shows and movies. But they&#x27;re still a staple.<p>But more to the point, the real magic isn&#x27;t in the data networks may or may not be able to use ahead of time. It&#x27;s in the data they should capture <i>from</i> the shows: how they&#x27;re trending, how they&#x27;re being talked about, what channels people use to discover them, conversion rates from various channels, marketing efficiencies in various channels, cohorts among viewers based on spending patterns, sentiment, word-of-mouth likelihood, etc.<p>My overall thesis is that less time and money should be spent on (80-90% useless) development research, and more money should be spent on analytical marketing post-launch. I think TV networks can learn a great deal from video game publishers, for example: similar business model, similar hit dependency, similarly huge budgets -- but a complete mastery of distribution and marketing channels.<p>Nielsen ratings, of course, get looked at and scrutinized daily. But those are lagging indicators, they&#x27;re approximations, and they&#x27;re not actionable. And changes made to shows can&#x27;t be directly attributable in the following ratings.<p>A strong counterargument to this logic -- and I feel I should give it its due say -- is that overanalysis will lead to design by numbers. And that&#x27;s a very real danger. But I think the greater present danger is on not being analytical <i>enough</i>. We&#x27;ve got a long way to go before we&#x27;re designing shows by numbers.

The final episode of Breaking Bad pulled in roughly the same numbers that your average primetime hit (or even indexed basket of hits) pulls in every night. So when we&#x27;re talking about the primetime averages, we&#x27;re talking about indices with viewership figures roughly comparable to Breaking Bad&#x27;s final episode. The point was that Breaking Bad was able to put a significant price premium on its finale relative to the nominal size of the audience it drew. It punched above its weight, so to speak. (Finale or otherwise, we&#x27;re talking about 10 million Breaking Bad viewers vs. 11 million CBS viewers.)<p>Is the comparison totally fair? In that specific context, in illustration of that specific point, I believe so. Would it be remotely fair if it were used, say, to illustrate a point about Breaking Bad <i>in general</i> vis-a-vis the market? Considerably less so. The point was more about its value to AMC, and less about the show&#x27;s ostensible superiority to any other network show.<p>To that point, I like your idea about contrasting Breaking Bad (finale, ordinary episode, etc.) with the average cost of an ad on AMC (though we&#x27;d have to control for the skew exerted on that index by Breaking Bad itself). That might be more apples-to-apples in certain respects, and it might have driven the point across a little bit better. Duly noted, and in as much as I am considering a followup, I may want to address that specific concern.",1382066919

6569576,comment,6566915,6569513,5,0,pdonis,,,"Thanks for the links. I&#x27;ll add one link, direct to the project page, since it has links to the actual data, as well as much more detail than is in the articles:<p><a href=""http://berkeleyearth.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://berkeleyearth.org/</a><p>I note two things on a first read-through:<p>(1) The project confirmed the data on temperature trends, but the error bar sizes are only reasonable back to about 1860; further back than that, the error bars get quite large. This is glossed over in the statements of findings: for example, the summary of findings (<a href=""http://berkeleyearth.org/summary-of-findings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://berkeleyearth.org/summary-of-findings</a>) says: &quot;Global land temperatures have increased by 1.5 degrees C over the past 250 years&quot;, but the error bars in 1750 are about +/- 1.5 C. You can&#x27;t conclude anything reliably when the error bars are as large as the signal you think you see in the data.<p>(I also note, btw, that this conclusion is mis-stated in the NYT op-ed by Muller: it says &quot;Our results show that the average temperature of the earths land has risen by two and a half degrees Fahrenheit over the past 250 years, including an increase of one and a half degrees over the most recent 50 years&quot;. Neither of those statements are consistent with the summary of findings page on the project site, which claims, and shows, 1.5 C rise over the past 250 years, as above, and less than 1 C rise over the past 50 years.)<p>(2) The project looked at statistics on temperature trends to test whether the &quot;urban heat island&quot; effect might have biased the conclusions; since they saw the same trends when looking at rural areas only, they concluded that it didn&#x27;t. But that isn&#x27;t the only criticism Anthony Watts made of the individual station data: he claimed that the locations of many individual thermometers, urban <i>and</i> rural, were poorly chosen (the classic case is one that was placed in the hot air exhaust stream of an air conditioning unit). The Berkeley project did not go and eyeball individual stations, as Watts did, so they had no way of assessing this effect.",1382066447

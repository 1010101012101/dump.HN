That you were surprised by the syscall underlying multiprocessing...says a lot although I could point to other indications.<p>Please don't make assertions as to the necessities of a specialty you haven't delved in, it makes it very difficult for me to be civil and respectful.<p>There is...no real comparison between C/C++ and Java for last-mile performance at the bleeding edge, even if Java is a VERY good high-performance replacement for Python for stuff like network services.<p>There are a variety of other use-cases where C/C++/Fortran/Ada are extremely necessary. Also note how abysmal Java has been for Android compared to Obj-C with its ever-present escape-hatch to raw C for making responsive and pleasant mobile apps. Especially games.<p>That aside, stuff like Singularity is research-grade only for very clear and obvious reasons. It isn't practical yet, if ever it would be.<p>Losing a lot of potential performance and control over the machine at the universal OS level is pretty...damaging and limiting.<p>It's bad enough that an entire programming language ecosystem can put a cap on your power over the computer and the performance/behavior thereof, to do that at the <i>OS</i> level except as a research project is unconscionable.<p>Please don't act as if Wikipedia articles about Microsoft Research projects are some indication of the vanguard of operating systems.<p>> you can still x-ray some Go code and have a pretty shrewd idea what the resulting machine code looks like, just like C/C++.<p>Er, maybe in the trivial case. You won't have anything close to a deterministic or real-time model for memory management available to you though. And never will.<p>Everything Go provides on top of C in terms of extra features essentially requires GC to function. (goroutines, and related features). The only thing it really adds on top of C that doesn't necessitate the GC is most aspects of the type system. That could be reused in a hypothetical systems language.<p>Go itself, in its current design, has absolutely zero future as a systems-language-of-first-resort outside of tinkering. (Some people will cross-compile Go code to chumbys and stuff.)<p>However, it has something more excellent available to it. A potential future as the hero that slayed Java and supplanted it. I would rather it did that than focused on trying to compete with C or C++. It's not suited to the task and cannot be reconciled with that goal as a fundamental property of its design.<p>Go is an excellent language for network services. Like Java.

4658916,comment,4658783,4658854,2,0,michaelt,,,"Last weekend I did some work with the OSM planet file - the thing with the XML format is it took several hours just to decompress it - even though I was reading it from RAM on an EC2 m2.2xlarge instance. And after that it still took an age to parse all the XML. All told it took 24 hours just to decompress the file and do a three-pass parse.<p>With the benefit of this experience, I decided it was worth switching to OSM's alternative 'PBF' format [1]. It's a dense binary format that doesn't require additional compression. It's also reportedly 6 times faster to read than gzipped XML. Honestly it seems very complicated to parse, but if you're willing to work with Java or C there's a parser already available.

One must be able to justify their job or salary by superior results (quantitatively better predictions, lower costs, faster development cycles).

4658903,comment,4657713,4658829,3,0,willvarfar,,,"all good points, well made.<p>I find it disappointing that we've come to label systems languages as the languages with the properties to implement the 'systems' of yesteryear instead of the systems of tomorrow; Singularity, for example.  One wonders if Pike and co were to build a new OS just where they'd put the managed/unmanaged line.<p>Wikipedia says <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_programming_language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_programming_language</a> ""The distinction between languages for system programming and applications programming became blurred with widespread popularity of C and Pascal."" and I'd hazard that Pike was smearing that blur wider by saying Go.  The Go FAQ <a href=""http://golang.org/doc/go_faq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/doc/go_faq.html</a> still starts by saying ""No major systems language has emerged in over a decade"" and implicitly saying Go is to be it.<p>Now to my point that C/C++ is usually a bad choice.  Most C++ projects I've seen have been misguided, legacy choices from the late 90s when C++ was the rage.  Then again, I've always been mystified by the appeal of STL, since it only just got a hashtable.  I have always ended up building higher-performance custom collections for stuff and found STL with its iterator-instead-of-ranges clunky.<p>I've written buckets of C/C++ code for OS and multimedia projects, some fairly recently; but even then, I'd rather have written only the innermost mechanics of them in C and lashed them together in something that was nice to work with, good C interoperability (no I don't think python tooling is nice) and didn't throw completely out all performance concerns.  And until Go came along, there really wasn't anything.  Python and so on are only useful for coordinating stuff when the task is embarrassingly and massively parallel.<p>Along comes Go; you can still x-ray some Go code and have a pretty shrewd idea what the resulting machine code looks like, just like C/C++.  Its within spitting distance of C/C++ code for performance and will improve.  And as the concurrent scheduling is all in the hands of wizards, one expects it to scale multi-core rather better than something working at the lib-level that requires more discipline to use.<p>Having said that, I'm actually using Java for a current no-compromise-performance rewrite-from-Python project now.  Its Go but its tried and tested.  Still, I am not enjoying myself too much.<p>FWIW, had a fun bug in production the other day; turns out I must be the biggest user of Python in a sense, since I discovered - via a crash - that multiprocessing is using `select()` internally and will fail if it it gets a descriptor over 1024.. how come nobody else has discovered this?  I see only one person has, and the fix is in ... 3.3.  Just a fun story.",1350377087

You'll see no lasting systemic change until people start growing up understanding the ins and outs of democracy by the age of 15. This does not even happen in the most affluent neighborhoods today. Education focuses on producing workers for the job market, rather than producing citizens for a democratic society. That's what needs to change. An adult graduating from high school needs to be capable of the highest offices of government immediately, even if they don't meet the age qualification. That capability gives them the tools to intelligently engage with their representatives and public servants as equals: as co-governors. Lobbying cannot be the job of an elite minority; it has to be that thing we <i>all</i> do from 4-6pm, after working from 8-4 and before enjoying dinner and leisure from 6-10.<p>Because the capacity to govern is properly distributed, you should see the end of the career politician. Instead, occupying offices should have a higher churn rate as more people run and more people qualify and more people have jobs to return to after their stint in office; the actual electoral result approaches random, negating any effective campaign strategy and thus any influence of money. Instead of campaigning for office, office-holders become facilitators for citizen discussion of policy. Their job is primarily to gather and synthesize, to properly weight authority, and to transparently explain how they determined which policy to adopt. The vote becomes a formality, rather than a nail-biting contest aired on national television.<p>That's what I have right now. It's not much, and it's pretty flimsy, but it's a skeleton to hang my coat on.<p>Enjoy.",1350376890

I actually quite like liquid democracy, but I'm not yet sold on the system; I have a friend currently working on implementing it and it's interesting to watch him work through its issues. It's one of those things that wouldn't have been feasible in 1800 but is far more feasible today.<p>Digression aside, the acknowledgement of the states is a neutralization of pure people power. It is the same reason that the Supreme Court is not elected, and executive appointees are not elected. These are things that are intended to be a check <i>against</i> the people. This is also why the tax-exempt status of churches is supposed to depend on the fact that they are to be politically neutral, and why Kennedy's Catholicism was such a hot issue when he ran for office. This is why charities frequently remain neutral in political discourse, why HN was divided on whether a business should be allowed to take sides on a political issue. This is why you're not allowed to discuss who you're voting for, or campaign for a candidate or issue, within a certain radius of a polling station.<p>Because ""one person, one vote"" never is. In any group of people larger than approximately 25 and definitely larger than 150, you will never actually <i>get</i> ""one person, one vote"". You will get political parties, who give you flyers saying ""Vote for these 5 dudes, vote yes on A, B, and D, vote no on C and E,"" and those flyers will be followed to the letter.<p>It is probably possible to maintain the argument for ""one person, one vote"" despite all of these reasons not to, of course.

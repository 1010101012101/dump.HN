I mean I get what you're saying, you don't want to communicate anything that's particularly suited to a twitter sort of form, and that that form of communication therefore seems trivial. I'm just saying communication forms a fundamental need, and if something facilitates that then thats what its for.",1205845030

139779,comment,139380,139380,0,0,ejs,,,"The problem is that software is very cheap to develop, really only costing labor. Any sort of hardware will cost more and the wild variations would compound that cost, ie analog circuitry vs autonomous helicopters requirements.<p>It would be neat to see happen but I personally think you would need more time and money to get any good demo.<p>I think most hardware would require about double the money and maybe the time as well... Basically it would be the same as many college senior project classes. Just with more money and less slackers.",1205844667

They'll need a resume to help with that, even if it isn't really a deciding factor.<p>Any company looking for funding will also need to demonstrate its value/potential to investors.

139768,comment,139090,139486,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"I like the point that you took away from the parable. However, most of the time someone shows me a parable like this it is to criticize the modern capitalist, consumptionist lifestyle. These critics idealize the primitive and believe that economic progress has made us corrupt and unhappy (although, strangely, you never see them moving to any of the primitive countries they idealize). Rarely do they understand the full consequences of the ideas they support. Nothing makes me angrier than the anti-materialists except maybe the legions bitching about income-inequality, which strangely often are the same people.",1205843616

Then the ""if IE"" code wouldn't trigger because the browser is Microsoft(r) MetalDog Home Premium, or whatever.  Of course they probably wouldn't want to lose the brand recognition of IE.",1205843452

I picked it up when I wanted to learn the language.

There's always new stuff to learn. :)<p>I'd agree with this advice: be passionate about what you do and keep on building stuff, it's the best way to learn.. not only that, try to think about what you're doing and why. It's better (and more fun!) to actually understand  how things work.<p>Learning from smart people is also a great way to learn.. it can be hard to find these people though.
I'm tipping this is a good place to find smart/talented people. I think you're in the right place. :)",1205843149

I'm itching to start doing something again and when I do, I guess I'll pick up something new.<p>What project are you working on?

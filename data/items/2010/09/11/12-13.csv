1681446,comment,1680391,1680391,0,0,Mz,,,"I also have aspirations of independence and have concluded that ""getting rich"" is not The Answer.  Some things that are working for me:<p>For health reasons, I have given up all furniture. I sleep on the floor with zero bedding. I had to get healthier in order to be able to do that.  Being cold was really about being sick.  It was a gradual process of using less bedding, getting healthier, and generally changing our lifestyle to need fewer things to meet our basic needs.<p>I have a netbook and a small folding shelf it sits on to keep it off the floor.  The little shelf has folding legs, so I can change its position.  I also have a prepaid cell phone as the cheapest phone access and have cancelled my landline.  No furniture means less housework.  It also means fewer bugs in the house.  When we first moved to this apartment, there were a lot of bugs.  I thought it was just that without furniture they were visible.  Over time, with getting healthier and getting the apartment cleaner and reducing our possessions further, we have fewer bugs.<p>At the moment, we own one deep frying pan.  We cook a lot from scratch, but they are simple one dish meals.  The medical condition I and my oldest son have is high maintenance.  So rearranging our lives so we have less to do in terms of cooking, cleaning, etc is essential in order for us to be healthy and still have time and energy to get a life (which we are basically working on now, after having spent about a decade working on getting well).<p>We live without a car.  That substantially cut our expenses and has turned out to not be as challenging as I expected.  Since we don't own furniture, we don't need to haul that much crap home.  We regularly buy food and clothes (because clothes gets thrown out routinely around here....long story) and we bought a netbook earlier this summer.  But I just don't need the kind of hauling capacity I needed when I lived more conventionally.<p>I have internet access via my netbook and could also have it via cellphone if I wanted it.  I guess the internet access my cell phone would offer would be more limited.  I'm reasonably content with the situation at the moment, though there are three people sharing one netbook and the plan is to buy one or two more netbooks when there is money for that and eventually add some (probably handheld) gaming systems.<p>Anyway, that's all that comes to mind at the moment.  Just start reducing your needs now. Have a yard sale.  Start living with less stuff.  Step by step, you can move towards this and as you make changes it will make other changes possible that you wouldn't have imagined.<p>Good luck.",1284208507

You can try, for example, StatusNet Desktop application (from identi.ca), and it feels like a crap. It's painful to install, not only you need AIR runtime (that's quite understandable), but there's an installator (like with Windows apps) that puts something (actually a lot of something) somewhere to /opt, and then, the application feels very alien, doesn't work well, lock itself all the time, and it isn't even ""pretty"". After seeing few of them, I can say that at least on Linux, AIR applications are nowhere close to the native applications (or possibly even web ones inside the browser!) in almost any aspect.

Those were the dark days of Apple: MacOS 7 was alright but less than brilliant and then they got stuck with the Copland project (the Mac version of project Longhorn). In the meantime Microsoft got Windows 95 out, and had several years to solidify its position.<p>2) Apple sold expensive computers back in the days. I don't mean the high end like today but actually expensive. The idea was that if there's so much demand we may as well milk the cow for all it's got. If I remember correctly Steve Jobs believed in lowering the price and going for marketshare, whereas Sculley thought better to get as much money as they could out of it. Eventually the latter one. This was another reason that made Apple lose marketshare<p>3) The customers for iPhones, Android phones or other smartphones are in reality the carriers. And they are very worried of losing their bargaining advantage (plenty of supply from different companies, but only few carriers to buy them). Hence I expect they'll try to avoid having anyone get a large marketshare. They may back Apple, Google, Microsoft, RIM and Nokia as it is to their advantage.<p>Finally a last difference is that Microsoft made a ton of money from their Windows product. Google is making little money from their Android. I am not sure what the implications of this will be, but it may matter a lot.",1284207252

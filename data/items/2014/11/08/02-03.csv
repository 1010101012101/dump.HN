8575839,comment,8574872,8575528,0,0,xnull2guest,,,"I&#x27;m rather partial to your comment. Though as a cipherpunk of my own generation, fully knowledgeable of rubberhose cryptanalysis and the rest, I do hold out hope that some of these technologies balance power and push them into the hands of the benign individual more than they magnify the power of a select or chosen few.<p>If all technology provides more power to everyone, but unevenly to where more is added at the top than the bottom, then the only thing that is left to defend against power inequality are court systems and forms of mass unrest. I distrust the completeness of the former (we&#x27;ve seen them go bad) and rather dislike the latter.<p>The pendulum could of course swing too far the other direction into anarchy. This, too, leaves my mouth bitter.<p>Ultimately I think technologies like Tor aren&#x27;t so bad. Certainly it is nothing compared to nuclear weapons or personal firearms. Information and communication, while they can aid criminal behavior, are not criminal in themselves. Like has always been the case - long before it was possible to monitor and store information and communication for later introspection - criminal acts are acts in the physical world and they can be investigated there.<p><a href=""https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2014/04/bruce_schneier_techn.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2014/04/bruce_schneie...</a>",1415415594

However, I have the sinking feeling that in this respect, Mr. Graham and his partners are the exception rather than the rule. That may well be one of the reasons why they are so successful. Not that I have hard data, and I&#x27;m not sure if reliable data could be obtained, but I have personally witnessed a frighteningly large number of incidents in which people were obviously influenced by the physical appearance of those whom they were tasked to judge.",1415415554

8575826,comment,8575106,8575585,0,0,PhantomGremlin,,,"> I think the biggest problem with any ideal portfolio allocation tool are black swan events (Taleb).<p>Yes. Black Swans are certainly a problem. It&#x27;s insane to think that investment returns are anything resembling a Gaussian distribution. In the financial crisis of 2008-2009, people were using phrases such as &quot;a 9 sigma event&quot; to describe the markets.<p>Wrong! Basically THERE&#x27;S NO SUCH THING AS a 9 SIGMA EVENT. Wikipedia gives the probability of a 6 sigma event as 1 in 500 million. So it the epitome of arrogance to think that we&#x27;re so &quot;special&quot; that we just happened to be alive during a 9 sigma market move.<p>What it all really means is that the markets do not behave the way lazy eggheads want them to. Everyone understands Gaussian distributions and standard deviation. So they are eager to use that math where they shouldn&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m sure you know all this.

8575813,comment,8574299,8575496,0,0,smeyer,,,"The numbers were split not just by race, but also by parental income. Yes, if you&#x27;re in the bottom 10 percentile of parental income as a white kid, it&#x27;s harder to get scholarships than if you&#x27;re black. Still, these kids are more likely to move up the income charts than their black counterparts, because even though race-based scholarships are more available, the other disadvantages outweigh them.<p>While I don&#x27;t have the numbers at hand, I think it&#x27;s unreasonable to expect that white children of parents in the bottom 10 percent of income are attending good suburban schools in significant numbers, because if you&#x27;re in the bottom ten percent of income you probably can&#x27;t afford to live in those regions, regardless of race.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that race is the most important factor, and I&#x27;d also like to see splits by schools and other factors. But I think parental income is extremely important, and even after controlling for that we see a very substantial racial component. If race-based scholarships were had such an overriding effect, we wouldn&#x27;t be able to reproduce these statistics. If you have numbers that show that controlling for some other factor (like school quality) leaves no remaining racial component, definitely let me know, but given how large the disparity remains after controlling for parental income, I sincerely doubt it&#x27;s the case.",1415414998

There&#x27;s no reason a retail investor should not tilt those odds a few points in their favor the same way professional traders do every day.<p>Please note this is just wrong.<p>There are actually 3 outcomes, which you should know if writing covered calls because you are essentially betting on the third option, which is that the stock stays flat, ie it doesn&#x27;t move.<p>My whole point is that selling covered calls does tilt the odds, just not in your favour:(",1415414583
8575802,comment,8574184,8575170,0,0,nostrademons,,,"For me - it&#x27;s because Go exists in the same uncanny valley as Java.  It is a language that manages to get a good number of trade-offs right, balances performance & productivity, and provides a good all-around package.<p>However, it&#x27;s not the best at anything.  If you need super performance and the ability to control the machine directly, you still need C++.  If you want super productivity and the ability to quickly try out ideas and see if they work, you still need Python or Ruby.  If you want to write for web browsers, you still need Javascript.  If you want to write for iPhones, you still need Objective C.  If you want to write for Android, you still need Java.  If you want to be absolutely certain your program will work as intended when it compiles, you still need Haskell.<p>I guess Go is the best mainstream language available in one area, networking concurrency.  And that&#x27;s where we see its successes so far - Cloudflare and Doozer (Heroku&#x27;s Paxos implementation) and dl.google.com.<p>But virtually all the money in the tech industry is made on the margins - by being the best in the world at one specific task.  If you want to build the fastest, most memory-efficient database possible - you still need C++.  If you want to crawl, parse, and index the most pages on the web - you still need C++.  If you want to have the highest-quality graphics at the best frame rate possible - you still need C++.<p>I could see Go getting pretty widespread adoption within the enterprise (as in, software departments of companies whose primary product is not software), much like Java has.  There, you <i>don&#x27;t</i> need to be the best in the world at something, you only need to make the best use of the computing resources you can with the staff you have available, and a language that gives you a good trade-off works out well.  But these people moved away from C++ a decade ago; the enterprise is all Java land now.  The people who still are on C++ generally work for product companies where performance is critical; because of the economics of the software industry, it pays for these companies to hire a  few more expensive developers and ensure that their product remains better than the competition than to switch to a more productive language and take the risk that their technology stack won&#x27;t let them achieve the goals that make them competitive.",1415414558

It becomes hard to imagine how it could work another way. It becomes obvious that weeks would be spent tracking one concurrency bug or having to add cron jobs to watch for crashed programs and restart them because the system is so complex and non-deterministic, replicating the bug is too hard.",1415412961

But in every other regard, these two projects are very dissimilar:  they differ in their goals, in their organization and in their technology choices.<p>Getting more specific, I (obviously) have a dog in the fight, so it&#x27;s hard for me to look at this with an outsider&#x27;s perspective -- but I think the most nonjudgemental way of phrasing the fundamental difference is that SmartDataCenter is opinionated where OpenStack gives architectural choice to the integrator and/or operator.[1] So in SmartDataCenter you don&#x27;t pick the storage substrate (it&#x27;s ZFS) or the hypervisor (it&#x27;s SmartOS) or the network virtualization (it&#x27;s Crossbow).  While OpenStack deliberately accommodates vendor differentiation, SmartDataCenter deliberately rejects it:  we are designed for commodity storage (shared-nothing -- and no RAID controllers, please!), commodity network equipment (no vendor-specific SDN) and (certainly) commodity compute.  The upshot is that the integrator/operator needn&#x27;t design the system themselves -- which we know from experience can result in greatly reduced times of deployment.  (Indeed, one of the great prides of SmartDataCenter is our install time:  provided you&#x27;re racked, stacked and cabled, you can get a cloud stood up in a matter of hours rather than days, weeks or longer.)<p>That fundamental difference -- opinion vs. choice -- has many ramifications.  For example, we have no interest in governance (sorry, democrophiles!); if someone has a good idea, we&#x27;ll do what most open source projects do and let our user community make that determination.  This is not to be overly controlling; anyone who disagrees with us (or with anyone!) is welcome to fork the project -- we have deliberately selected a fork-friendly license in MPLv2.  We also have no interest (zero, none, nada) in legacy enterprise hardware vendors that are interested in cloud computing only as a vector for preserving their inalienable right to screw their own customers; there won&#x27;t be &quot;hooks&quot; or &quot;plugins&quot; in SmartDataCenter or generally other such sheep-like wolves.<p>There are many differences, of course, but I think many can be explained by the fundamental difference in engineering principles of the two projects.<p>Anyone who is interested in the nature of the opinions asserted in SmartDataCenter -- or in helping form new ones! -- should check out the repos[2][3] (we try to document our thinking), join the mailing lists, and/or join us in IRC at #smartos on Freenode.<p>[1] This is a bit of a &quot;pro-choice/pro-life&quot; nomenclature in that I have deliberately picked nomenclature that I think these two projects would use to put themselves in the best light.  More candidly, I would say that OpenStack seems to me to be a discombobulated mess -- and I&#x27;m sure to OpenStack, SmartDataCenter would seem supremely fascist.<p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/joyent/sdc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/joyent/sdc</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/joyent/manta"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/joyent/manta</a>",1415412956

Statements about &quot;reliable&quot; or &quot;unreliable&quot; happiness in response to a discussion about depression reduce depression to, essentially, a period of unhappiness.

It took almost year to hone basic Java skills and learn necessary basic stack of technologies to do plain Java projects. It took another year till I got my enterprise stack skills to acceptable level. Every technology/framework is 1-1.5k pages book reading and hours of practice just to start doing something useful. And then you have to repeat that every year, because frameworks updating faster than you can learn, priorities shifting, you forget things.<p>Edit: However, I must say, ^ was done almost in vacuum: I had noone to ask and had limited access to the Internet (sorry, no Stackoverflow for you :). With good instructors, well-prepared programs and strict discipline in classromms, I would say it is possible to get into entry-level positions.",1415412366

I&#x27;d love to be proven wrong but getting from autonomous under limited circumstances (say designated section of limited access highways) to the more general case seems an enormous distinction that will span decades. Fifty years? Yeah, I could believe that. But not 10.<p>(And I&#x27;d also argue that if AI is at a level where you could have truly autonomous cars, you&#x27;re also at a level of truly profound change in many, many different areas.)",1415412086

Anonymous people are more likely to share opinions that don&#x27;t conform to the opinions of the hive-mind in politically charged subjects because there are no repercussions to them doing so. Anonymity is a direct solution to combating hive-minds and upvoting/downvoting is something that further enables hive-mind-like behavior. Why are you saying that preventing anonymity helps with hive-minds? You&#x27;re conflating two different issues: quality control and hive-minds.<p>You can have high quality posts that don&#x27;t challenge anyone&#x27;s mindsets, this is high quality and high hive-mind. You can have low quality and low hive-mind. And ideally you want high quality and low hive-mind. Anonymity lowers your hive-mind but often lowers your quality. Upvoting/downvoting increases your quality but also increases your hive-mind.",1415412039

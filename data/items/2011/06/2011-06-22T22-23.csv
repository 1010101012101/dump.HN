2685763,story,,,6,3,abbasmehdi,"Tell/Ask HN: Why the cloud scares me (including Heroku and GitHub).",,"Has anyone read through a service agreement with cloud service providers?<p>First problem: Cloud hosting services are apparently not responsible for ""security and privacy"" of whatever you upload. This basically means you don't own what you create/upload - they could pass on your uploaded content to anyone (even for money) and you have no remedy against them. This also means no IP for you (since they are considered public domain)!<p>Second problem: The cost is sky high when you scale. Has anyone done a cost comparison b/w cloud based maintenence, hosting and deployment vs your own servers on maybe rented out racks? Compare backups and multi-nodal solutions.<p>Finally: You have no control over your stuff - what triggered this in my mind was when I saw how many companies have their sites taken down while they are being investigated for stuff they have very little control over vs. companies who own their infrastructure and thus need to be subpoena-ed or issued a warrant against to but taken down. For example, consider two scenarios of a popular company, say Facebook or Craigslist, let's make it FB. Now if FB is on the cloud and some teenager kills himself from being bullied through it then all the police have to do is ask the hosting company to take down FB while its under investigation. The hosting company wants to keep peace so it complies and FB cant do a thing about it. On the other hand, if FB has its own infrastructure and the cops have an issue, FB can wave the middle finger at them until they get a order from a judge to shut their servers down, which is much, much harder for cops to do and they must make a strong case before getting such order. So basically my point here is youre at someones mercy and could be driven out of business easily by the flick of a switch.<p>None of this is concrete, and is just a starting point. However, they are serious concerns, and I dont think there is a better place than HN to ask this question. Please share your thoughts freely.",1308783375

Say we have a country with 300 million people making $100 each per year (all exactly equal) and 20 people making $1 billion each per year (also all exactly equal).<p>The total income is $50 billion per year.  The Lorenz curve looks like a straight line from (0%, 0%) to (100%, 60%) (because the area under those 2 people making $1 billion is zero for our purposes.  That means the area under the Lorenz curve is 0.3, the area _over_ the Lorenz curve is 0.2, and the Gini coefficient is 0.4.<p>That's lower than the Gini coefficient for the US.<p>Which was the poster's point: if you have a very small rich elite and a vast pretty poor populace whose _total_ income is comparable to the total income of the elite due to the sheer numbers of the poor, then inequality measures like the Gini coefficient will be very strongly affected by the inequality within the poor part of the population.  And if inequality there is low, overall inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient can end up looking pretty low in spite of the existence of the rich elite.<p>Note that if in the above example the 300 million people each made $1000/year, not $100, then the Gini coefficient would be very low... in spite of those 20 really rich guys.<p>Now maybe you don't think this situation has much inequality, but that's a separate issue.

It is akin to the reason why security cameras, if facing the public, must have a disclaimer sign with: ""I am recording you"". The cookie must inform the user: ""I am tracking you"". Right now, most users are unaware cookies even exist.<p>I agree my surfing behavior should be private, but I don't agree with the strictness and ambiguity of this law.

This is not entirely complete/correct.<p>First off, the same problem occurs no matter which database. Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, whatever, they all grind to a halt when stuff no longer fits in RAM.<p>Second, it's not really the whole data set or the whole index that needs to fit in RAM, it's the <i>working set</i>. This is a pretty big difference. I'm currently running a production MongoDB database which is about 20 times larger than RAM and at first I made the mistake of using random string primary keys (_ids). This ensured good distribution between shards but also ensured good distribution within the primary key index. This essentially made the working set of the primary key index equal to the entire index. Once the primary key index no longer fits in RAM, the database grinded to a halt. I now use a primary key consisting of a timestamp followed by some random text. The timestamp ensures that inserts only hit the end of the index, thereby keeping the working set small.

Farm workers can't unionize nearly as easily if they are undocumented, and undocumented workers don't have to be paid standard wages. In fact, they can explicitly be paid substandard wages and there is no way to complain. Your parents, most likely.<p>Undocumented workers lower unskilled work wages and working conditions far past what a documented system would. Further, as workers age out of the ability to do backbreaking farm work, they have no legal protections on which to rely, and can be thrown back out more easily. The DREAM act, however, brings people into the system with legal protections, people who can't easily be exploited in the same way their parents are. Your parents, that is.<p>And that's why we face an uphill battle with the DREAM act.

For instance, I can provide a simple implementation in Haskell that includes addition, multiplication and square roots:\n  data Real = Real<p><pre><code>  add :: Real -> Real -> Real\n  add _ _ = Real \n\n  multiply :: Real -> Real -> Real\n  multiply _ _ = Real\n\n  squareRoot :: Real -> Real -> Real\n  squareRoot _ _ = Real\n \n  zero :: Real\n  zero = Real\n\n  one :: Real \n  one = Real\n</code></pre>\nbut it isn't very interesting as you can't print things or test for equality...Any implementation of real numbers that includes those is going to be much harder[3].<p>[1]<a href=""http://videolectures.net/aug09_spitters_oconnor_cvia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://videolectures.net/aug09_spitters_oconnor_cvia/</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Exact_real_arithmetic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Exact_real_arithmetic</a>\n[3]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarskis_undefinability_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarskis_undefinability_theorem</a>",1308780322

So I email people a few times:\n- after one week to ask them if there was a problem\n- after two weeks to offer a free trial of the paid upgrade\n- after one month with a short user survey<p>It appears that less than 5% of these emails generate an action from the inactive users.\nIs this normal ?\nAre most people entering fake email addresses ?

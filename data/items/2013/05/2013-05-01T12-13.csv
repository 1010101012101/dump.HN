What about the rest of the permission-hungry apps? Whatsapp? Facebook? Any Google app? Any other big developer's app? What if the founders of Path just start a new company?<p>Not installing Path is not a solution here. You gotta look critically at the permissions an app uses and their terms of service (at least skip to the privacy related issues, though they usually try to hide and obfuscate them). If there is something you don't entirely trust, wonder why you really need that app. Perhaps it's an improvement for your life, but can't you really live without? You've gone without that app for the past how many years? Is it worth giving up your phone book and all sdcard contents?",1367413199

Actually, that makes them crappy is their ubiquitousness.  Even if you seldom use Flash or Java applets, you'll often find yourself having them installed, because there is that one site that needs one or the other.<p>Now, people like us with the technical knowhow know how to get around that (disable plugins; flashblock, etc.), but most people just install these things whenever there are updates, each is a change of getting crapware along with them.

If this made it into stock android, developers would be forced to put phone book access in a try{} block so that permission revoking doesn't crash the entire app. Your solution with returning an empty phone book sounds even better, but that's also more work so I don't know whether that'll ever make it...

Like a virus they replace the societal leadership function and use the ""normal"" mechanisms of law and order for their own ends.  People are ""arrested"" and ""tried"" just like every day - but it is a farce.<p>Now at what point do you shoot a police officer? When is it socially acceptable to kill a cop? There just does not seem to be a point.  So for years this can go on.  Rounding up ""criminals"".  I could put psychologists on stage to say ""treatment of the whole family"" is the solution for criminal activity - we are taking these families to family-re-start camps.  You can make up anything for a while.  Its only when the media provide proof that this is going on, that people are dying that <i>maybe</i> killing the next cop to arrest someone will be seen as righteous.  But you could easily argue that 60 Minutes cannot be aired because it will incite people to shoot cops.<p>After the cop has arrested you, that's it, you have no guns, game over.<p>2. Serbia<p>This is very muddled but basically can be seen as just arrest / herd everyone out of a defined geographic area - for example it would be everyone in the street <i>apart from</i> #47 and #186.  Round them all up with an army / militia and send everyone to a processing camp.  Thus the removal of guns happens to a whole neighbourhood, and can be done with artillery and tanks.  Cant arrest everyone cos they are all armed?  Really it seems not to work like that.  The mass graves in Serbia / Croatia are filled with military age people.<p>3. Rwanda.  Half of your village attacks your family with knives.  Imagine say the white folks in NYC deciding to kill the black folks using pitchforks [1].  This is hardly a controlled genocide so is less crime against humanity than WTF.<p>I was focusing on the first one - there seems to be no point 
where shooting a cop (even one in a black shirt) is something acceptable, even for people who would otherwise shoot back.<p>There is something built into us that perceives immediate danger as a threat, but if danger is kept far enough apart from the ""now"" we rationalise it away - even if it is bleedin' obvious.  Its why i supported Blair/Bush invading Iraq - I mean the guy had a track record, of <i>course</i> he had WMD.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_draft_riots"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_draft_riots</a>",1367412317

According the Union of Concerned Scientists, the 30 billion was the cost of the antibiotics, not the weight. The antibiotics weighed 24 million pounds. Besides, what does the total mass have to do with prudent use? If I said we used 100 billion pounds to save people, would you consider that acceptable?<p>You also need to put that number in context. In 2010, American meat companies produced:
26.4 billion pounds of beef
22.5 billion pounds of pork
5.8 billion pounds of turkey
313 million pounds of veal, lamb and mutton
37.2 billion pounds of chicken<p>Finally, there is no clear evidence that the proper use of antibiotics in food animals has ever led to a disease resistant bacteria in humans. Don't you find it much more alarming that your GP will prescribe antibiotics to common visitors just to get them out the door? It's far more likely you're going to die purely because someone next to you won't leave the doctor until they get an antibiotic, regardless of their health status.",1367412100

Just like ""Do you agree to the terms of service?"", you hardly have a choice. I was very surprised to see people <i>not even glance</i> at the permissions before clicking Accept.<p>But as I said, it's blackmail anyway whether you look or not. You don't want them to have all your contacts, your exact location, all data on your sdcard, and full network access? Fine then, you won't get [whatsapp] (or pretty much any other app), that what everyone else has and that you're almost socially obliged to have (at least in my age category).<p>It even goes so far that the android user has no permissions to use the permission manager to deny or allow permissions for apps. There are commands (""pm grant x"" and ""pm revoke y"") that lets you change apps' permissions... but you can't use it by default, even as root (""java.lang.SecurityException: Neither user [your uid] nor current process has android.permission.GRANT_REVOKE_PERMISSIONS"").

So the problem isn't solved but the answer is not coming up with yet-another-file-format.<p>A good example of extending TIFF with tags is Pixar's PhotoRealistic RenderMan.

All the Microsoft Office formats (DOCX, XLSX, etc.), all the OpenOffice formats, all the iWork formats, ePub, Safari extensions, Chrome extensions, JAR files, and countless other general public-facing formats are exactly that: loose collections of files that contain an index file (or multiple index files) and are combined using zip. ""<p>In other words, a single encapsulating file... Which was my point?<p>The exact implementation is hardly relevant is it?<p>""No, you couldn't.""<p>Of course you can. Just include hashes of the different resources within the file and only the parts of the file that contain changes needs to be downloaded. Or implement something more general along the lines of the rsync algorithm.<p>Taking html as an example you could also do everything transparently on the server if you wanted to. Or do everything transparently on the client instead if you wanted to keep a snapshot of each visit as a single file.<p>But no, I'm not arguing that we should encapsulate all web pages. But on the client side, if the user chose to save a webpage, the result should in most cases be a single encapsulating file.<p>""Many PDFs do, in fact, rely on this capability.[1] It's generally transparent to the user.""<p>The keyword was <i>only</i> used linked resources. I think my point was, and is, rather obvious. PDF would never be where it is today if it weren't for its ability to encapsulate resources.<p>EDIT: My point isn't that all files should be encapsulating all the linked content. There must be a point to it. Web pages on a server, hardly beneficial... Image files? Absolutely.",1367410791

5637448,comment,5636586,5637434,10,0,smtddr,,," Well, IMHO, this story is about racism. I've read too many stories on african americans ending up with criminal records for things I've seen non-african americans do without consequence.
 Also, I have a similar experience with chemistry class in high school. While a white kid burned holes, dropped chemicals he had no business messing with, and other moderate damage to school property more than 5 times, _in front of everyone including the teacher_. I did one thing, that didn't endager anyone, didn't break anything. I booted up an old AppleII computer and played music on it(the bubble-bobble invincibility theme music I coded in BASIC)..... ended up in the priciple's office for ""tampering with chemistry class computer system"". This computer wasn't doing anything; it was covered in dust.
 Mom & I went to the principle and, as it turns out, the principle totally tore up the write-up from my chemistry teacher in front of us, then she said ""Don't worry about it. I know that teacher of yours. This isn't going on any records. It ends here."" She was white, in case that impacts this little story of mine. Chemistry teacher was a white male. And my parents were born & raised in Nigeria.",1367410507

5637439,comment,5636876,5637154,12,0,jballanc,,,"Depends. In many cases of antibiotic resistance, the actual ""resistance"" is a matter of degrees. For example, Penicillin interrupts the cell walls of bacteria, so in Gram negative bacteria it is only active in the periplasm. Some forms of Penicillin resistance work by metabolizing the Penicillin before it can do its thing. Other forms work by simply pumping the Penicillin out of the periplasm. The former mechanism requires a specific enzymatic activity. The later usually just requires tuning the pre-existing pumps that maintain the environment of the periplasm to be more specific to Penicillin or pump faster over all. In fact, most ""multidrug resistance"" genes are simply pumps that can exclude drugs from the insides of bacteria in general.<p>But really, this is just the shortest of short answers.

For example, apricots (which are just now in season) are $2.50 per pound. When the height of apricot season kicks in, the price will come down to around 50 per pound. But if I want a steak I can expect to pay at least $12 per pound.<p>I take a certain comfort in the notion that this price difference reflects the true cost of producing meat. Likewise, everything is locally sourced because there isn't really any other option, so everything taste fresh. Produce is only available when its in season, but this adds a fun sense of anticipation as the seasons change.<p>That's one point of view. The other point of view is that feeding antibiotics to cattle improves yield. Transporting produce long distances ensures that it can be grown where conditions are best, and flying fruits in from Chile means that supermarket customers can find what they crave even in the middle of winter.<p>The US has a long tradition of asking ""can we?"" not ""should we?""

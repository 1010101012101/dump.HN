Without the source, your only option is to port the game to a new version of Unity.  That&#x27;s not so great.<p>But again, I&#x27;ll readily admit that all of this is only a win if you have the right team with the right skillset.  There are definitely tradeoffs involved.",1424390397

It is usually a natural consequence of your skills being in high demand that you&#x27;ll be able to ask for a higher salary.

9078019,comment,9076558,9077969,0,0,marknadal,,,"Wonderful questions! Actually some of the best in the entire thread I think.<p>1. See (3) but first read:<p>A) The upper boundary is defined by the current machine&#x27;s local clock, which could have skew or drift.<p>B) The lower boundary is defined by the last known update on an individual record (down to the UUID+field).<p>2. The expected use case is for this conflict resolution algorithm is for basic field/value pairs (terms defined here: <a href=""https://github.com/amark/gun/wiki/semantics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/amark/gun/wiki/semantics</a>, and here: <a href=""https://github.com/amark/gun/wiki/JSON-Data-Format"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/amark/gun/wiki/JSON-Data-Format</a>) within a UUID an object (called a node, as in a node in a graph).<p>This is what HAM works off and is considered the lowest level atomic pieces (the value). In order to sync on collaborative text you need to build an OT layer on top of this (I plan on doing this, possibly integrating with ShareJS as another mentioned). You cannot collaboratively sync on atomic values by themselves, you must define a CRDT for that - plugins/modules for them will be coming later.<p>3. Vector Clocks. HAM does not assume what the sort key is for state, it just assumes it is a value it can do <, <=, ===, =>, > comparisons on.<p>A) Vector clocks have a vulnerability that if you are working with temporary/ephemeral machines, the clocks will constantly get reset and have to play &quot;catch up&quot;. However, network partitions are highly likely, so there is no guarantee that two machines won&#x27;t issue a conflicting vector clock. If this happens, there is no standard way of dealing with this, although there are plenty of work arounds.<p>B) Timestamps also have a vulnerability, that is if you set your local clock ahead (say 2 years in the future) then it will &quot;always win&quot; wiping out other peers valid values. However you unfortunately cannot determine in an untrusted network whether a peer is being malicious about being 2 years in the future, or if they are actually at a different point in timespace - like a GPS satellite or on Mars, or went offline in the subway.<p>C) As a result, this is why I combine them together via the boundary function. The upper and lower boundaries of the state machine provide the relative &quot;vector&quot; for the untrusted timestamp in the delta update.<p>The benefits of this technique are two fold:<p>1) You get deterministic and idempotent resolution within a special-relativity timeframe in a decentralized system without gossip (consensus).<p>2) If you do run GUN within your own trusted network, you can use the timestamps to calculate drift between machines and then readjust the boundary function of the state machine. Thus giving you a highly accurate &quot;objective&quot; view of your data across peers, which if the latency is low enough could indicate it is worth creating locks (but thus sacrificing Availability).<p>Hope this was clear enough! Any questions? I&#x27;m going to be reposting this in the rest of the thread.",1424390038

9077909,comment,9075333,9077825,0,0,rayiner,,,"The overhead of GC is independent of heap size. Take the following variables:<p><pre><code>    L = total size of live objects in heap
    H = maximum size of heap
    P = time between collections
    R_a = rate of allocation
    R_s = rate of heap scanning
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s easy to define P and R_s (assume a mark-sweep collector so we can ignore copy reserve):<p><pre><code>    P = (H - L) / R_a
    R_s = L / P
</code></pre>
Substitute and simplify:<p><pre><code>    R_s = L / ((H - L) / R_a)
    R_s = L / (H - L) * R_a
</code></pre>
In other words, <i>it doesn&#x27;t matter how big your heap is.</i> If you make your heap twice the live size, the amount of heap scanning you do will always be equal to your allocation rate times some constant. If H = 2L, that constant is 1.<p>So the way to improve performance is to cut down on that allocation rate. If you use RAII for most objects, and GC only occasionally, your allocation rate, net of non-GC allocations, will be very low, which means your scanning rate will be very low. You&#x27;ll have to traverse all live objects every GC cycle, but you&#x27;ll rarely have to do a GC cycle.",1424388745

9077780,comment,9075945,9077427,0,0,venaoy,,,"> As a buyer, why would I use bitcoin internationally when I can&#x27;t reverse my transaction if they don&#x27;t deliver?<p>Sometimes reversibility just doesn&#x27;t matter. The merchant might be 100% trustworthy (like Amazon). Or as another example I once rented a VPS for a month from Russia. I paid in bitcoins because it was $3 or $4 so I simply didn&#x27;t care if the VPS provider didn&#x27;t deliver (submitting a chargeback request for such a low amount is not worth my time), but at the same time I didn&#x27;t fully trust the merchant with my credit card info (how securely do they protect/encrypt it? could they be hacked? etc).<p>> Since we don&#x27;t gift each other bitcoins, Example 3 isn&#x27;t a problem.<p>You completely avoided the main point of my example #3. And that&#x27;s very stupid for you to say this. I gave some to my family, I could say this proves you wrong. Even Coinbase set up a page to give bitcoins last Christmas because it&#x27;s common for enthusiasts to give some to friends & family: <a href=""http://blog.coinbase.com/post/105032873402/give-the-gift-of-bitcoin-this-holiday-season"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.coinbase.com/post/105032873402/give-the-gift-of-...</a><p>> Example 4 is laughable because in the last week, four Bitcoin exchanges were hacked (or robbed by the owners - still TBD) and people who had their coins in those exchanges lost it all.<p>This is completely irrelevant to example #4. My point was that a Bitcoin transaction cryptographically authorizes only the transfer of a specific amount to a specific address, and nothing else. In contrast a CC transaction lets a fraudulent merchant place any charge for any amount at any time. This is a substantial undeniable security advantage that Bitcoin has over credit cards.<p>> Skimming CC numbers is for sure an issue for credit cards, but as someone who has had their credit card skimmed, my issuer locked my account within 2 hours of fraudulent activity, called me, and eventually gave me my money back.<p>You were lucky. But your cute story doesn&#x27;t mean credit card fraud is a solved problem. In many cases the customer has NO RECOURSE for fraud. For example you cannot chargeback a transaction made more than 60 days ago. Some fraudulent merchants pretend to act legitimately but stall shipping (eg. claim delays, issues, etc) for 60 days specifically to exploit this fact and exploit the fact customers don&#x27;t know about this condition. Or if your PIN code is stolen and a fraudulent transaction is made with the PIN code, you will typically be held liable (check your credit card issuer&#x27;s fine print, for example: <a href=""http://www.scotiabank.com/ca/common/pdf/borrowing/revolving_credit_agreement.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scotiabank.com/ca/common/pdf/borrowing/revolving_...</a>)<p>> How many Mt. Gox users got their money back?<p>Give your money to a fraudster and he will run away with it, no matter if its bitcoins or dollars.

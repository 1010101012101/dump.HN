I honestly think this is a fairly unbalanced presentation of Android. How long did you have to wait to get copy and paste working on the iPhone? Can you run multiple apps at the same time on the iPhone? Can you have widgets on the iPhone? What about the well known problems of the iPhone App Store we all hear a lot about these days? And about the hardware: if you have a problem with the non-standard earphone connectors of the G1 (which can be solved by a $5 adapter), what do you think about not being able to replace the battery of an iPhone yourself? You don't have these problems on Android.<p>I'm not trying to bash the iPhone here as I truly believe that it's a great phone, all I'm trying to say that this review isn't really fair and balanced.

AT&T: 4Chan Blocked Over DDoS, Not Content
Jordan Golson | Monday, July 27, 2009 | 10:22 AM PT | 3 comments 
AT&T has finally issued a statement about the company’s unannounced blocking of certain parts of forum site 4Chan. A number of parties blamed AT&T for “censoring” the Internet, presuming that the company had blocked access because of the content on 4Chan, which can range from classless to tasteless to everything in between. In fact, AT&T said it blocked one section of the site to control a distributed-denial-of-service attack that was affecting an unnamed AT&T customer. 4Chan is, for lack of a better term, the “Wild West” of the Internet. It is an unedited, unmoderated message board that is surprisingly influential on the Net. 4Chan users have been credited with starting lolcats and RickRolling. Last year, a 4Chan user allegedly hacked into Sarah Palin’s Yahoo Mail account and posted the password on 4Chan. The site, especially its /b/ page, is an interesting place — very, very “not safe for work.”<p>According to a statement from the phone giant:
Beginning Friday, an AT&T customer was impacted by a denial-of-service attack stemming from IP addresses connected to img.4chan.org. To prevent this attack from disrupting service for the impacted AT&T customer, and to prevent the attack from spreading to impact our other customers, AT&T temporarily blocked access to the IP addresses in question for our customers.  This action was in no way related to the content at img.4chan.org; our focus was on protecting our customers from malicious traffic.
Overnight Sunday, after we determined the denial-of-service threat no longer existed, AT&T removed the block on the IP addresses in question. We will continue to monitor for denial-of-service activity and any malicious traffic to protect our customers.<p>The story got legs on Reddit, where many commentators scorched AT&T, saying the company “censors the Internet,” and 4Chan fans formed bulletin boards to organize “retaliation” against AT&T. TechCrunch wrote that blocking a web site without notification is an “extreme breach of user trust.” Of course, the blocking evidently wasn’t over 4Chan’s content, which AT&T assures me it would never do, but instead over network protocols that were affecting other customers.<p>Net neutrality is all well and good, but when one particular server is negatively impacting other users, AT&T is obligated to respond. Not everyone jumped on the blame AT&T bandwagon, however. Late last night, Shon Elliott from unWired Broadband wrote on the North American Network Operators Group mailing list:
There have been a lot of customers on our network who were complaining about ACK scan reports coming from 207.126.64.181. We had no choice but to block that single IP until the attacks let up. It was a decision I made with the gentleman that owns the colo facility currently hosts 4chan [sic]. There was no other way around it. I’m sure AT&T is probably blocking it for the same reason. 4chan has been under attack for over 3 weeks, the attacks filling up an entire GigE. If you want to blame anyone, blame the script kiddies who pull this kind of stunt.<p>""The above newsclip is distributed to educate and inform.  This does not imply accuracy nor endorsement of the views by AT&T."" 
---end---<p>My response:<p>AT&T did a good thing (stopping a DDoS attack), but they need to be more on top of their “twitter relations,” people claimed to have called in to AT&T and received the response that the site was blocked due to content. Now that is may normally the case, so the support person on the phone was probably just hazarding a guess, but once the story caught on fire AT&T’s twitter account should have tweeted that taking down 4chan had nothing to do with content. Or at LEAST that they could say they were investigating.<p>I know it was the weekend, but the story went pretty far, and AT&T is already getting blamed for Google Voice being blocked on the iPhone, so they don't need anymore bad press. If a corporation is taking down a website over the weekend they need to be ready to explain to the public why, otherwise they are just asking for disaster.",1248972497

732540,comment,731947,731947,0,0,lee,,,"First, no code. Sketch. Sketch using a magic marker on printer paper where the other side has already been printed. Make these sketches quick and not-pretty. Do many. You want to be able to throw these out without hesitation. Using software to build pretty wireframes will invest you in how something looks. Don't do it. Wireframe software is for presentations.<p>Think about the flow of the majority of users. Can you engineer it so that 80% can do what they need to do in the fewest clicks possible? Remove functionality. You can always add it later. What are the core experiences you want your users to have? How lean can you make the experience and still have it do what you want it to do?<p>Spend the next couple of months sketching. Leave your house. Go sip espresso at a cafe on the Rocks. Think about those people. Now go to Paramatta. Think about those people. (I'm assuming you're in Sydney.) Go be in places where different people from different walks of life are and be with them. Really figure out who your audience is. Get to know your audience really really well. Focus on that audience. You are their servant. Show them random sketches and get them to tell you what they think about the layouts you're sketching. See if you can engineer four or five different ways to flow the same experiences and functionality.<p>My favorite framework for social networks with ecommerce is Drupal with Ubercart. I've built several social networking sites with ecommerce using it. The user system is already built. It's very flexible and just a little PHP can get you a long way. What's more, there's a very strong community built up around it with forums and several IRC chatrooms. There are meetups in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. There are many themes available that can be customized with just a little tweaking. There's going to be a learning curve no matter what framework you use, but Drupal has the advantage that the need for Drupal developers and themers is growing exponentially. (Recession? What recession?)<p>The way that Drupal adds functionality is by adding modules. There's a central repository on Drupal.org with thousands of modules already written. Chances are that much of the functionality you're looking for can be built using combined Drupal modules. Drupal has a system of hook functions for users, content and just about anything else you can think of. You can search for pieces of functionality using google and add the word Drupal in front of it. When you land on an article or forum post, pay attention to which version you've landed on. It's important.<p>The thing that will really prove Drupal's worth is the community. It's very supportive, has its own security team, and when you build a site, and there's a security update, your site will email you and let you know. (It'll let you know whenever there's an upgrade, too.) Drupal's a gratifying playground for developers. (While the framework isn't object oriented, it's good to be up on objects and arrays.)<p>While you're in the sketching phase, build a couple sites for nonprofits in your area. Not only will this teach you how to build sites in whatever framework you choose, it'll teach you about working with clients, and you'll learn a lot about why you don't want clients. (Nonprofits are notoriously disorganized. There's something about the profit motive that focuses people.)<p>Expect this kind of schedule:<p>3 months of sketching layouts and workflows. Meanwhile, become part of the community and build small sites for yourself and nonprofits.
3 months hacking at whatever technology you want to learn. 
3 months starting and throwing away Drupal sites. Start over as many times as you need. Use version control. (GIT or SVN)
3 months building your site.
2 weeks to 1 month theming your site.
3 weeks testing with friends and family (closed beta)
3 weeks extending closed beta
1-2 months open beta
Launch when you have the marketing in place.<p>Marketing can be done for free in several stages. Very very often the free marketing is much more effective than the paid marketing.<p>Look at business partnerships. Who also serves the same audience but isn't a competitor? For example, if you want to reach kids, you can partner with one of those companies that takes the school pictures and has products like mugs or t-shirts with the kid's picture printed on it. You can add a membership to your site to their product catalog for no money down. See who is serving the same market and who has already done their marketing homework and partner with them for a percentage.<p>Lastly, remember that this is a marathon and not a sprint. Do not burn yourself out. It's important. Once you have the site up and running, it's only the beginning. I haven't mentioned hosting or other important details, but the information is out there. If you can get a partner, life will be easier and you can provide moral support for each other.",1248972136

There is a limited, scientific chiropractice that limits itself to physical injuries, and while its domain is not zero, it's so limited I sometimes wonder at if it's really enough to be its own specialty. Maybe it is, it just seems thin to me compared to a full physical therapy regime.<p>Then there's the total quack chiropractice that gets covered by things like <a href=""http://www.chirobase.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chirobase.org/</a> .

They can make good business sense, certainly, as you'd rather hold on to the customer's left-over credits. And consumers can be more likely to spend credits due to the mentioned abstraction layer.<p>That said, they're a firmly consumer-unfriendly model, for those very reasons. And even then, the ""more likely to spend credits"" factoid only comes into play once they've actually bought into the system - seeing that it's Yet Another Credit System can be a slight added barrier to entry.<p>Expanding on this, if every place I spend money online worked with its own ""credit"" system, I would have upwards of 20 idle balances of my own money earning interest for someone else.

As such, you can expect to receive both credit and blame for everything attached to that company and you are responsible for doing everything within your authority to fix problems.  That limit may be nothing more than putting the person you are dealing with in the correct department, but if that is it you should pass along the contact information (in both directions!) respectfully and courteously, not dismissively with ""I just work here.""<p>As a manager, I would be unhappy to ever hear one of my employees say that no matter what their job.

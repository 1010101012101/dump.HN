A woman whose boobs are falling out of her clothing at work is not dressed professionally. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s discrimination. We don&#x27;t let men show up in &quot;muscle shirts&quot; either. We allow women to show a LOT more skin than men and still call it &quot;professional.&quot; I think this one restriction on keeping the cleavage covered is a very reasonable standard.<p><a href=""http://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/2014/02/nothing-but-bunch-of-boobs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/2014/02/nothing-but-...</a>",1426035576

Most engineers fail to realize how critical all of them are. They fail to demand fair compensation for their time.

Compare to C#, which appeared 15 years ago, or Go which is from 2009, or Swift, which hasn&#x27;t even celebrated its first birthday yet.<p>Better comparisons might be Python and Ruby, which are both fully dynamic and have cool metaprogramming facilities like JavaScript does, but they&#x27;ll both give you hard errors when you type the equivalent of [].lenght.  And they give you proper stack traces and error messages, too: none of &quot;undefined is not a function&quot; which took until 2015 to get fixed in Chrome (try it).  Working with Node.js will make you fall into despair when you realize that your program crashes, and it has stack traces, but none of the stack frames are in your code because everything has been threaded through callbacks.  Python&#x27;s major implementation has serious problems with concurrency (re: the GIL, global interpreter lock) and it too has dynamic types everywhere but it&#x27;s still far easier to work with.<p>What I want is to be able to refactor a JavaScript project without feeling like I&#x27;m crossing the river Styx.  Where are the call sites for this function... who knows?  TypeScript seems to at least give me some of those tools, it&#x27;s a shame that the tooling isn&#x27;t really ready--the compiler takes ages to run (timed it at 2.0 seconds on a small project... I might as well be using C++ at those speeds).<p>And if Google has been using TypeScript as a basis, as they say, then you can keep using JavaScript the way you want and you don&#x27;t even have to type anything in differently.  Just let us add some type checking if we want it.",1426035130

Movie B is a very mixed piece that isn&#x27;t really enjoyable to watch, but &quot;advances the art&quot; in some key ways.  Movie C is an even more well loved blockbuster than movie A, which even more millions of people will see and enjoy, but that was only made because the director was one of the few that really understood Movie B.<p>The argument, as I understand it, is that Movie B is somehow objectively better than Movie A and Movie C, <i>because</i> it enables Movie C to exist, even though Movie C isn&#x27;t actually good, because it doesn&#x27;t advance the art?  That doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.  The journey has value only to the extent that the destination is valuable, no?

That might not be fair but it&#x27;s life.

When improper sexual relations get to the level of legality, both people&#x27;s lives are damaged and logic dictates that&#x27;s often going to be unfair to one of them (and logic leaves us in the lurch determining apriori which, despite the ideology and vituperations of all parts of the political spectrum).<p><i>But, the modern workplace culture encourages being more then &#x27;professional coworker&#x27; to your coworkers outside of the office.</i><p>Indeed, at the start-up workplace seems to.

My scenario is &quot;men harasses woman, someone else sees&quot;. Your stats are impeccable, but they are about victims reporting, and that is totally unrelated to my argument.<p>You&#x27;ve yet to explain why the third-party thing is important.<p>===\nI&#x27;ll leave the middle part for last.\n===<p>>> 2. No one is morally obligated to solve a problem for which they are not responsible.<p>> Yep, I agree here, the question is about how to define &#x27;responsible&#x27;.<p>Well google dictionary defines responsible as: &quot;being the primary cause of something and so able to be blamed or credited for it&quot;.<p>>> 3. You can never fully ascertain risk, especially in these circumstances.<p>> Agreed that you can never be sure. This applies to everyone so it doesn&#x27;t change my argument at all. It just changes where you draw lines, not if you draw lines.<p>This isn&#x27;t merely a theoretical argument.  When a woman steps in to stop harassment, there is a real threat of violence.  There&#x27;s no way to reasonably determine what the amount of risk is.  Even if the woman reports the episode after the fact, there is always a chance of retaliation, either by the harasser or by the reporting woman&#x27;s boss, or by prospective employers because she&#x27;s been blacklisted.  It&#x27;s critical to understand that because of this, your scenario does not exist.<p>>> 4. It is grossly entitled for a system that oppresses women to ask women for support so it can stop oppressing them, labeling them as &quot;part of the problem&quot; if they refuse.<p>> It&#x27;s entitled to do this to anyone who is not a harasser, but someone&#x27;s gotta explain that it&#x27;s not okay.<p>There are two issues with the argument you&#x27;re making here:<p>1. The system oppresses women so it&#x27;s unfair.  The system doesn&#x27;t oppress men (OK you can make a gender roles argument, but let&#x27;s stipulate for now), in fact, white men built this system, so it&#x27;s fair.<p>2. The issue with your argument that you make here is your phrase &quot;to do&quot;.  Women don&#x27;t control the patriarchy, they can&#x27;t direct society to force white men to police themselves.  They obviously can&#x27;t, because it&#x27;s not happening.  You&#x27;re implying equality between white men and women when you say, &quot;it&#x27;s entitled to do this to anyone&quot;.  It isn&#x27;t, because women aren&#x27;t responsible for the patriarchy, rape culture, and so on.<p>>> 5. Given the current situation, which simplified could be characterized as men having $10,000 to solve a problem and Women have $7,500 to solve a problem because the problem has already cost women $2,500, why are women obligated to spend any money at all to fix the problem? Hasn&#x27;t the problem cost them enough already?<p>> This hits right at the core of how you and I disagree. I don&#x27;t think unfair treatment should come before moral obligations. Moral obligations are there no matter how you&#x27;ve been treated.<p>I vehemently disagree with this.  I have no obligation to treat someone who beats me with respect, for example.  Or if I&#x27;m married and my partner cheats on me, my moral obligations change significantly.  Do you disagree?<p>> But perhaps you say the obligation is for the rich to help first. That is totally valid! White straight guy has to help the most, because he had it easy. I can get behind that! But then Man Z, who only has $300 because life screwed him over, I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s more obligated to help than the woman with $7,500 is.<p>This is where the analogy, like all analogies, breaks down.  In the patriarchy, we deal in the currency of privilege, and privilege is relative.  If a man has $300, there&#x27;s a comparable woman with $225.<p>===<p>Now your bullet points.<p>>> * Do you disagree that it&#x27;s not women&#x27;s fault someone is being harassed?<p>> Depends on what &#x27;fault&#x27; means. They have no direct fault, they share in societal fault.<p>I more or less mean &quot;responsibility&quot;, which again is &quot;being the primary cause of something&quot;.  Therefore, even if I buy into the idea of societal fault (which I don&#x27;t), women clearly have no responsibility for this.  They&#x27;re obviously not the primary cause of the patriarchy.<p>>> * Do you disagree that women are not responsible for the patriarchy?<p>> Women are partially responsible for the patriarchy.  They are not slave-caste.<p>I actually feel like this is the root of our disagreement.  Let&#x27;s use actual slaves as an analogy.  There were free blacks in the US during slavery.  Did they bear any responsibility for slavery?  Your argument says that they did, even if it&#x27;s a small amount, because they had at least some power.  But, of course, this is ridiculous.  They didn&#x27;t create slavery, and given its druthers, slavery would oppress them (if it hadn&#x27;t already).  Same thing goes for the patriarchy.<p>The oppressed are never responsible for the system that oppresses them.  How could that even be the case?<p>It seems like you&#x27;re implying that the patriarchy is a problem that affects us all and we&#x27;re all in it together to dismantle it.  But that&#x27;s incorrect.  The patriarchy was created by white men, and it benefits 1/3 of the population while oppressing the rest.  The oppressed are not responsible for the system that oppresses them, therefore it&#x27;s morally incumbent on those who benefit from the oppressive system to fix it.<p>>> * Do you disagree that women are far more likely to suffer the effects of retaliation compared to men, because they&#x27;re far more likely to experience harassment?<p>> I agree that women are far more likely to suffer retaliation because they experience more harassment. However I am not convinced about retaliation unrelated to self-reporting. In particular I am not convinced that women trying to fix societal flaws are far more likely to suffer retaliation than men.<p>Again you&#x27;ve yet to explain why third-party is important.  I will also clarify and say that regardless on the retaliation risk to men and women, men bear responsibility because it&#x27;s our system, and because we know for a fact that women experience high levels of retaliation.<p>===<p>I&#x27;m not gonna quote all the junk for the last point and the final section, because HN isn&#x27;t really equipped for these kinds of discussions.  What I will say is that it boils down to this:<p>Women are not members of the patriarchy, any more than blacks were members of slavery, or any other oppressed group is a member of the system that oppresses them.\nEven if you argue that contemporary white men did not create the patriarchy, white men are the only ones that benefit from it.  You cannot morally obligate the oppressed to fix the system that oppresses them.  The only group left is the group unoppressed, and that&#x27;s white men.  This is why all men are responsible, and no women are responsible.",1426033210

Let&#x27;s exaggerate to show why:<p>Collect all throws on a random bowling alley for a year. I predict that the 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10 configuration as the first throw has a higher success rate than as a second throw.<p>Reason? Players who end up with that second shot must have completely missed the first shot. Good players will occasionally get there (if you wait long enough you will even find a pro throwing it, maybe because he suffers a stroke during play), but bad players will get there disproportionally more often. Of all such second shots, 90+% may be played by the bottom 50% of players.<p>Similarly, I think the 7-8-9-10 that isn&#x27;t in this dataset isn&#x27;t impossible. I would guess children who are barely strong enough to throw the ball will occasionally throw it.<p>Thinking of it, bowling would get way more interesting if one could get more points for difficult combinations. Let&#x27;s say you announce &quot;I&#x27;ll leave the 7 and 10 pins standing and take them out with my second ball&quot;, and go on to do that. Surely, that&#x27;s worth more than a dull strike?",1426032804

It is worth understanding the fundamental economic underpinning of this.<p>Two observations or assertions: a) People have more debt than a generation ago b) People have less leisure today than a generation ago.<p>These two assertions seem broadly true world-wide. As an example, young people can observe how many of their college-educated peers are graduating with excessive levels of debt. These two are connected - in fact, I believe (a) causes (b), to the extent that you can determine causation in social science.<p>Now who caused (a) i.e the culture of debt? Answer: Government policy, in particular central bank policy. Ultimately, money is credit in a fiat system, so when we talk about ""Fed creating money out of thin air"", they are really creating credit (i.e debt instruments) out of thin air. Eventually, cascading layers of debt entraps most of the population - corporations and individuals alike.<p>Debt causes serious cultural and social changes. Keynes had this right:<p><i>There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.</i>",1227563106

Really?",,"I'm working on a web startup with a partner and I'm just feeling unsure of whether whole SaaS thing <i>really</i> works.  Maybe it's because I'm personally reluctant to pay for stuff online, but I feel like some of my enthusiasm for this thing is waning because I'm doubting whether anyone really pays for anything.<p>I mean, I've read all the success stories about the YC companies and other web startups, I've read the ""Autopsy of a web app"" article that the Particletree guys wrote (awesome, btw).  But I would love to see more numbers, as well as hear success stories from others, no matter how small.<p>To be blunt, though, I have a hard time believing that people will really sign up and pay for this in the numbers that we need.  Our service isn't that expensive, starting at about $20 / month, and we need about 500 paying users to be ""ramen profitable"".  But once we get to several thousand users, things start to get really interesting.  Is that at all realistic?<p>I know it's heavily dependent on the market, what value we add, etc, but to give you an idea, our target market is primarily small companies, tech startups, bloggers, and others with a strong online presence.  Probably a little smaller than the market for something like Basecamp, but similar in nature.<p>Bottom line: is it unrealistic to think that we can get 5000 users paying $20 / month?  I know this is an unrealistic question to ask without more info, but I'm just trying to get an idea of what the upper limit of realistic expectations is.  If a company like 37 signals only has 2,000 paying users for Basecamp, then I don't feel great about our chances.  But if they have 200,000 paying users, I feel better about it.  I just literally have no idea of what's realistic in terms of the size of a paying userbase.  I know that others will be reluctant to post their numbers, but perhaps you can post them under a different account name or something?  I would absolutely love to know how many paying users you have.  Help a fellow entrepreneur out here :-)",1227561726

375391,comment,374706,374875,0,0,etal,,,"As a vimmer who has used Visual Studio in the past:<p>- Auto-complete can done in emacs and vim, too. There's an older vi-style completion which just completes from existing tokens in the current file (Ctrl-P) and a newer ""omni-complete"" (Ctrl-X-O) which is a bit smarter. For better poking around, keep an IPython session running.<p>- Don't scroll by hand in vim. There are keybindings for all kinds of jumping around and finding the declaration or definition you need.<p>- Search and replace: I'm surprised you would doubt this.  Vim itself is a search/replace/insert filter; there's no dialog you bring up; full regular-expression navigation and substitution is always active. That's why a couple of keystrokes is usually faster than reaching for the mouse, for vim and emacs users.<p>- Command line: Yes! Search, replace, sort, find a declaration, pull up the documentation for a function, run a documentation generator, interact with the version control system -- most of it's build into the editor, and for what isn't built in, the editor gives easy access to the system shell. It's perfectly reasonable to build and edit your code with vim in one window, perhaps split into a few buffers, while playing with the resulting program in a terminal window next to it. For an interpreted language like Python, you don't even need to restart the interpreter, just reload the modules after they change. Thanks to this design, all of this works just as well over an ssh or telnet session.<p>Vim/vi is built for Unix; on Windows, without Cygwin, it's fairly crippled compared to a system that's fully integrated with the operating system. Unix was made to be programmable, and the shell gives significant help for inspecting the system and connecting different programs together. So a text editor that gives direct access to all of these capabilities and builds on top of them is very powerful -- assuming you already know how to use the shell effectively. For VS, it's the other way: VS makes Windows programming reasonable, while doing the same things without the IDE's substantial help (perhaps the way it is in Eclipse) is brutal.",1227560540

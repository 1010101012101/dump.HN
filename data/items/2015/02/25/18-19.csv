The danger of AI is that is will put increasing power in the hands of those who have the data and the know-how, i.e. large corporations and governments. The power of mining usefully the troves of data they have on every citizen, both on a micro level and a macro level, to understand what people are doing, what they are thinking, and what they are going to do next. And ultimately, to control what they think (to give you an idea, Facebook can already influence your mood by selecting what goes into your newsfeed).<p>First comes intelligence, then prediction, and finally, control.<p>Yes, AI is something we should probably be worried about, in the same way that we should have discussed the privacy implications of the Internet years before the NSA files.

We&#x27;ve just been tip-toeing through endless warfare, poor economics, poor social policy, and occasionally skirting with nuclear destruction.<p>Give the AI&#x27;s a chance to contribute, especially if the solutions to problems we can&#x27;t crack are because of human cognitive limits.  This situation reminds me of how the Apollo landings couldn&#x27;t be done without computers. There&#x27;s just no way a person can do those calculations on paper.

By focusing on the theoretical harm that been done to the extent of all other considerations, you can justify anything. It&#x27;s a dangerous mentality that has resulted in many evils throughout history. Hell, this is the same justification ISIS originally used when recruiting Sunnis who were tired of corruption and discrimination at the hands of the Shia Iraqi government, only with the economic context replaced by a political one.<p>A more mature ethical position would recognize that in some environments, while evil has been done which harms or disadvantages you, the strategy of employing &quot;any and all effort necessary to further one&#x27;s interests&quot; is likely what gave the advantage to those who have allegedly disadvantaged you. If you successfully follow through with this attitude you&#x27;ll likely perpetuate a cycle.<p>If you are going to cheat, break rules, or whatever you should do so because those rules or prohibitions have little or no moral and social value in the context in which they exist.

Even with the statistical adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, I seriously doubt that the people who use saunas frequently have the same income levels, attention to health, and all sorts of other habits as the people who never use saunas.<p>So I would put this study on the heap of interesting correlations that ultimately mean nothing.<p>BTW, they should look at the development of Alzheimer disease.  There is suspicion that high body temperatures (e.g. with fever) can incite the changes in protein conformation that are thought to be essential in the establishment and progression of the disease.

9108598,comment,9108311,9108311,0,0,hooande,,,"Machine intelligence does pose an existential threat to humanity. The question is, how does that threat compare to all of the others? Is it greater or worse than climate change, the possibility of a bio-engineered virus, growing income inequality, nuclear war or asteroid strikes? It&#x27;s true that malevolent machine intelligence has the potential to systematically exterminate all human life in a way that many other threats do not. But the question is, what are the odds of that actually happening?<p>The first issue is that the development of machine intelligence is wildly unpredictable. We have made incredible progress with statistical optimization and unsupervised categorization in recent years, but we have very little to show in terms of machines that can do human level reasoning, creativity, problem solving or hypothesis formation. One day someone will make a break through in those areas, perhaps solving it all with a single algorithm as the essay suggests. But we have no idea when that day will be and absolutely no evidence that it&#x27;s getting any closer. sama does note these points and states the timeline for a dangerous level of machine intelligence is outright unknowable. I can only assume that the second part of this piece will explain why we should be concerned about something that might or might not occur at some point in the near or distance future, as opposed to the very real and quantifiable threats that the world is facing today.<p>The other issue is that we have no idea what the nature of machine intelligence will be. The only model we have for intelligence of any kind is ourselves, and the basic aspects of our reasoning were shaped by millions of years of evolution. Self-preservation, seeking pleasure and avoiding pain, a desire to control scarce resources...these were all things that evolved in the brains of fish that lived hundreds of millions of years ago. They aren&#x27;t necessarily the product of logic and reason, but random mutations that helped some organisms survive long enough to produce offspring. A machine intelligence will start completely from scratch, guided by none of that evolutionary history. Who knows how it will think and see its place in the world? If someone explicitly programs it to think like a human, and it cannot change that programming of its own accord, it might indeed decide to think and act like a sci-fi villain. But it seems like the most likely outcome is completely unpredictable behavior, if it chooses to interact with us as a species at all.<p>This Superintelligence book has sparked a meme among very smart people. That&#x27;s just how culture works, I guess. Some ideas catch on among certain groups and others don&#x27;t. But I can&#x27;t wait for the technical intelligentsia to move on to something else so that we can get back to the business of making stupid machines that are incredibly good at optimization and prediction.  The world has a lot of real and pressing problems, here and now, that affect lives in a negative way. Hopefully we can use statistics to do more with less, and bring relief to those who need it instead of worrying about what-if scenarios and unanswerable questions.",1424889736

But I hope I can tell you why recruiters and hiring managers act the way they do, so that you can handle them better and understand their constraints.<p>I&#x27;ve written about this a lot elsewhere: <a href=""https://medium.com/terms-conditions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/terms-conditions</a><p>The message you sent to the recruiter and the hiring manager at Company X was: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to work for Company X.&quot;<p>Hiring someone is kind of like getting married -- an employment agreement is a long-term commitment to mutual dependence as you work toward a common goal, and it involves a large share of your hours every day.<p>You want to marry someone who&#x27;s nice to be around, who can hold up their end of the deal, and who shows clear signs of wanting to marry you in return. That desire is expressed through the effort they put into your relationship, especially in the beginning.<p>Both you and the company face the same challenge: gathering reliable information about someone you don&#x27;t know. The only information the company cares about is a) can you do the job? and b) are you easy to get along with? By refusing to take the coding challenge, you gave them no answer to a) and a clear signal that the answer to b) is &quot;no.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not saying you should waste a lot of time taking hourslong coding challenges for companies that you don&#x27;t want to work for. But if you do really want to work somewhere, you need to find a way to show them that you can do the work and that you won&#x27;t be a wrench in the gears.<p>You could have tried to meet them halfway. Get some projects you&#x27;re proud of up on Github that you can point them toward. Let them know that you&#x27;d be happy to do some live coding during a technical interview so they can hear you think out loud as you solve problems. That&#x27;s one way to minimize the time and effort you expend, and still give them information they need.<p>They&#x27;re not going to pay you to get that information, but like you, they should be willing to spend some time, in a process of escalating commitment, to make sure you can do what you say.<p>What a lot of good software engineers don&#x27;t realize is that there are a lot of bad software engineers out there. The job market is full of noise. People lie about their skills and experience. So employers need to be able to test those claims, and they do it with coding challenges.<p>I have to respectfully disagree with @taprun. The fact that coding challenges can be applied to the job market for software engineers makes it much less corrupt, and raises the quality of matches between employers and employees.<p>MBAs and HR people are not in a position to show what they make. This leads to a lot of bad decisions. That said, there is still a screening process. A good company does a ton of reference checks, and watches them closely to see if they deliver on the job. If they don&#x27;t, they&#x27;re usually gone in a few months.",1424888935

Any new venture is intrinsically hard to value, and even a global optimizer would be reluctant to invest in those. This is no different from risk aversion, which I&#x27;ve already cover.

However, this is a distinct concern than an alleged short-term bias in capitalism, an idea which I was attempting to refute.<p>The problem you describe exists just as much in the short run as in the long run.<p>As for what it is to be done, I think several things can help:<p>- Relax antritrust legislation: large companies who aren&#x27;t threatened by competitors can capture a lot of externalities and tend to develop new science and technology.

If you look at how Deis does it, they&#x27;ve actually created tons of little binaries to help with different tasks (<a href=""https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/2254"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/2254</a>) because the unit files get too crazy by themselves. You end up trying to build a system like Kubernetes using shell scripts and unit files.<p>The key thing to remember with CoreOS is it puts systemd at the center not docker and only interacts with docker through the client.  In fact, there&#x27;s really zero docker integration besides shipping the binary.<p>There&#x27;s also the underlying technical issue around what is PID 1.  In your example, you aren&#x27;t actually monitoring the container, you&#x27;re monitoring the status of the docker client, which may be different than the docker daemon.  For containers, the docker daemon owns the fork rather than systemd.  In a system like Kubernetes you have a reconciliation loop that monitors the daemon.  You could probably build a similar idea into your unit files to make them more robust, but that&#x27;s even more complicated.<p>Having gone down the systemd route it seems like a dead end to me for distributed docker applications.  If you believe in a containerized future, then choose an orchestration framework that treats docker as first order primitive.  You can still bootstrap this framework using CoreOS/systemd but after that I&#x27;d much prefer to just interact with a higher-level system.",1424888606

You didn&#x27;t, and so you probably will not get the job.<p>To your second question: I find this particular challenge to be unreasonable. I have provided coding challenges many times for people who are interviewing for companies I work for or own. Sometimes they are &quot;very large project&quot; type challenges. But I always stipulate in writing and over the phone that &quot;we would like you to time box your efforts to 30 - 60 minutes total. Focus on some aspect of the project you would like us to see. We don&#x27;t mind if you only write a single function. We want to understand your methods and thought processes, that is all.&quot; I find this works exceptionally well. Unfortunately, a number of technical companies really get this interviewing thing wrong.<p>Now for some friendly advice, which, of course, you can take or leave. You must be looking for a job or at least you are attempting to have a relationship with this recruiter, because it seems you have spoken to companies that this recruiter has found for you. It is good to not burn bridges with recruiters. You just burned a bridge.<p>You need to realize that the recruiter is never going to pass your message along to the client. The recruiter is right now crafting a message to the client saying &quot;Chad really doesn&#x27;t have time to complete the challenge because he has a few other offers on the table. Would you like to give him an offer? Of course if you don&#x27;t, I have 30 other engineers for you to look at who would love to complete the challenge and will be a great fit for your company!&quot; Yes it is a blatant lie, and your recruiter may make up an entirely difference excuse for why you won&#x27;t do it. But the client will certainly never receive your message. Never.<p>In the future when a job comes up which fits your skill set and price range, do you think this recruiter is going to think of you first? Not a chance. &quot;Chad looks like a perfect fit for this. But, what if they give him a code challenge? That&#x27;s a lot of hassle to have to save face with the client. Hmmm Susan and Johnny are both pretty good fits as well, I&#x27;ll send them.&quot;<p>Your point is good but your presentation is the problem. Maybe you could have tried:<p>&quot;I am super busy right now, I just can&#x27;t complete such a large challenge with my family life and work schedule. Please let your client know I am so sorry and I don&#x27;t want to cause them trouble, I just can&#x27;t complete it at the moment.&quot;<p>This would have been a great way to get out of it that would have left the recruiting thinking of you in the future. Alternatively you could have tried something like:<p>&quot;Wow! I really like this client and I would love to work with them. It sounds like the Director really wants to find the right candidate. However, I am a bit concerned. This is not just a lofty challenge but a time consuming one, especially with family, kids, and work. I estimate this would take me 8 hours to complete. Maybe I am way off though. I would love to show them my abilities, but would they object to me time boxing this to 1-2 hours? How can we work together to make this happen?&quot;<p>Your milage my vary of course, but don&#x27;t burn too many recruitment bridges, or you might find you have no way to cross over to the other side.",1424888233

Generally, almost everyone involved in your points was compensated to do something, even if it wasn&#x27;t the work that became the Internet stack, or if compensation was not their primary goal.<p>My point was actually rather minor - that the military does not function as a top-to-bottom altruistic organization. You went meta and made some good points about society in general. Please indulge my meta trip because I think it might illustrate why Google et al have the &quot;successionist&quot; impulses of which they have been accused.<p>A principle of justice we seem to accept nowadays without too much question is that one shouldn&#x27;t have to be bound to an accident of birth - e.g. Racial discrimation. Then why should someone be bound to the accident of being born American?\nA plausible argument there is that the success of something such as Google might be impossible for a non-American company.<p>Neither argument seems eminently provable, but maybe more important questions might be whether one can choose to whom one might share the fruits of one&#x27;s labors and how much one should share.<p>For example, the Christian Church had a nominal demand of 10%. Certainly that was a lower limit but at least it was publicly known. Modern society doesn&#x27;t seem to care for such clarity - as best I can determine, the cut seems to be &quot;as much as we want&quot;, which is probably a harsh interpretation, given the complexities of our political and fiscal systems.<p>A way to rephrase the who question is - &quot;assuming I have to share my fruits with others, why must it be with the country of my birth? Why can&#x27;t I pick someone else? Why can&#x27;t I pick myself?&quot; This isn&#x27;t an argument from left field, it&#x27;s not too far from the position of the USA c. 1776, though the Declaration seemed to dwell on the injustices of the British Empire more than on the right to choose one&#x27;s master.",1424887765

Capitalism makes investments much more fungible than they would otherwise be, changing the incentive landscape. It can set up a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma (i.e. a failure of global optimization due to induced local optimization) which preferentially allocates capital away from investments which are intrinsically difficult to value in a timely fashion or intrinsically difficult to capture value from (i.e. science).<p>Correct tulip speculation gets you $$$, making a correct incremental step towards curing cancer gets you nothing on the market. Nobody will be able to tell if your contribution was valuable for the next 30 years, and by then you won&#x27;t have any mechanism by which you could retroactively hold back your contribution in order to obtain a fair market price for it. According to capitalism, this unfortunate (but completely incidental!) state of affairs is a good reason why investors should speculate in tulips rather than fund biotech. Yuck!<p>Can we do better? In the narrow sense of solving this particular problem, the answer is yes: a prestige-based economy (see: academia) is able to reward investments whose value can&#x27;t be captured by a market economy, such as the &quot;incremental progress towards cancer cure&quot; example above. Of course, a prestige-based economy would fall flat on its face if one tried to generalize it to more mundane facets of everyday life, so it&#x27;s not a satisfying solution for the general problem. But it IS a good way to get free-market drum-beaters to acknowledge their very constrictive assumptions about timely valuation and value capture :-)",1424887752

There are pitching motions which hurt my arm just doing them in slow motion, now imagine heaving a baseball 90+ mph repeatedly for your entire life.<p>This is a far different selective pressure than what e.g. soccer players would have where quickness & speed on their feet is what matters.<p>The problem with these discussions is that people are using words like &quot;taxing&quot; to only narrowly mean what they want it to mean.",1424887584

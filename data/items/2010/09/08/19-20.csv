But I have worked at 3  different startups in the period of 3 years as an employee before landing a cushy job in a big corporation.<p>Working at the startup before having my first child: not too bad, sometimes stressful, but I could handle it well.  The work was always engaging, and it was hard to separate work from life.<p>Working at startup post-child: stressful, because now having a kid means I can't put in long hours at work as my family needs me at home.  I would much rather forget about work and focus on the needs of my family when 5 PM rolls by.  I was more susceptible to burn out once I started my family + working at a startup.<p>Big Corp: lack of stress, nice compensation + benefits = happiest workplace.  The slower pace does not drive me crazy, and instead it gives me a chance to indulge in my technical curiosities.<p>For now, I'm enjoying my big corp employment. It's only been 3 months so far, and I realize that may change if I have to deal with more corporate BS, but it's the most enjoyable workplace I've been at so far.<p>The catch here is that my team here is top notch, and the section I'm in is very engineering/hacker oriented.",1283975962

The way sizing is handled in the clothing industry is ridiculous for women especially, but for men as well according to this article.<p>The basic technology product is software that, given information about your body shape, can produce a listing of clothing that <i>will</i> fit you. As far as we can tell this does not yet exist. When the customer can trust that the clothes will fit, then they can shop based on style, fashion, price, or any other number of more interesting criteria rather than worrying about getting the right size or cut.<p>If you pair this technology with a customer-centered online retail environment then I think you can create a lot of value. Zappos has shown that you can make buying articles of clothing online work, with their famous customer support and return policies.<p>The concept of requiring a customer to consult a sizing translation table <i>per label</i> or even <i>per garment</i> just to find clothes that fit well flabbergasts me. But we haven't found any better solutions on offer.<p>This all fits in with Request For Startup 2: New Paths Through Product Space. <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/rfs2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/rfs2.html</a> Nobody is selling clothing based on what fits the individual shopper. We want to make an online storefront that only offers clothing that will fit <i>you</i>.<p>There are a lot of negative knock-on effects from the current way clothes shopping is done. People agonize over sizing and equate their waistband with their self-worth. That's ridiculous. Every person will look best and be most comfortable in clothing that matches their actual shape, regardless of what number is on the label. Especially if that number is a lie!<p>Clothes shopping changed drastically starting in about the mid 1800s through the 1920s with the advent of mass-produced garments. Before that each item was made individually. After that, confusing labels, garments designed to fit the ""average"" person to minimize the need for alterations, changing demographics, and vanity sizing turned the whole system into an incredible morass. It wasn't always this way, and it shouldn't have to be.<p>The article suggests that government regulation of sizing labels is the solution to the problem of ill-fitting clothing.

1673093,comment,1672538,1672716,0,0,thwarted,,,"I think the parent comment is referring to OpenVPN's HMAC packet authentication of the TLS control channel, the --tls-auth option.  From the man page:<p><i>The  rationale for this feature is as follows.  TLS requires a multi-packet exchange before it is able to authenticate a peer.  During this time before authentication, OpenVPN is allocating resources (memory and CPU) to this potential peer.  The potential peer is also exposing many parts of OpenVPN and the OpenSSL library to the packets it is sending.  Most successful  network attacks  today  seek to either exploit bugs in programs (such as buffer overflow attacks) or force a program to consume so many resources that it becomes unusable.  Of course the first line of defense is always to produce clean, well-audited code.  OpenVPN has been written with buffer overflow attack prevention as a top priority.  But as history has shown,  many  of  the  most widely used network applications have, from time to time, fallen to buffer overflow attacks.</i><p><i>So as a second line of defense, OpenVPN offers this special layer of authentication on top of the TLS control channel so that every packet on the control channel is authenticated by an HMAC signature and a unique ID for replay protection.  This signature will also help protect against DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.  An important rule of thumb in reducing vulnerability to DoS attacks is to minimize the amount of resources a potential, but as yet unauthenticated, client is able to consume.</i><p><i>tls-auth  does  this  by  signing every TLS control channel packet with an HMAC signature, including packets which are sent before the TLS level has had a chance to authenticate the peer. The result is that packets without the correct signature can be dropped immediately upon reception, before they have a chance to consume additional system resources such as by initiating  a TLS handshake.  --tls-auth can be strengthened by adding the --replay-persist option which will keep OpenVPN’s replay protection state in a file so that it is not lost across restarts.</i><p>and I just realized who I'm responding to... :)  I'd be interested in knowing if the above isn't a strong/decent rationale.",1283973787

Non-Euclidian geometry, or group and set theory stuff, or whatever else you see that is off the beaten path and possibly taught by a well-liked professor. You will learn to solve problems better using non-standard techniques, and it may be just plain fun.<p>* One of the two or three classes in the philosophy department that deal with logic, puzzles, paradoxes, and such. You may be surprised at first that about a third of the people in those classes are in your CS classes, too. Figuring out what is computable and what is true isn't all done in your discreet math classes.<p>* A basic science class unrelated to your engineering field. Astronomy is a good one. Learn about your world, and possibly meet your future spouse.<p>* The most popular class on campus. Every school has that cool class taught by the famous professor that everyone attends. There's a reason for that. It's probably in the psycology, english, or history departments. Your spouse may also be in this one.<p>* Introduction to Civil Engineering. Knowing a bit about static forces, failures, and materials helps you when you need to build or fix stuff. These guys also have been engineers a lot longer than there have been software engineers. They teach you how to fail properly, perform repeatable tasks to ensure quality, and other engineering practices.<p>* Law for business students. Your business school offers an intro class to the law. It's like the first year of law school smashed into a single semester class for business students. It covers contracts, torts, agencies, and other things that will keep you out of trouble.<p>Yeah, most of these classes aren't in the CS department.

If craigslist itself was under a serious legal assault, or its managers facing criminal charges, I'd be right there with you. It seems to me, however, that craigslist's opponents would be happy to leave it at ""don't run ads for the sex trade"".<p>I simply don't believe that's an unreasonable position.",1283972713

You'll find most charters pay higher than public schools for an equivalent amount of experience (public schools have a lot of 30 year veterans on the payroll, charters not so much).<p>Anyways, if you're looking for talent, then market rate is the rate required to lure in talent from other industries.  You can probably pay a little less because people like the idea of being a teacher, but it can't be egregiously less, which is what it is right now - what would I make as a first year or fifth year math teacher?",1283972609

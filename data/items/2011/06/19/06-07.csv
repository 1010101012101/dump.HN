Also what exactly do said children bring to the table? If the young man there had a prototype already in the works built by himself, that would be something.<p>Honestly, I never understood the idea of pitching startups at events like these to garner funding or co-founders, with no actual code/product/etc no matter the age, skill, or race of the individual. Always seemed a little quixotic and irrationally exuberant. pg and co seem to not mind however, as they seem to have gotten pitches (and accepted them) for non-existent startups. Wasn't Reddit at 0 when it was pitched and accepted into original YC?<p>Then again, there's a quote of pg somewhere saying nearly everyone has a product/some code at least now when pitching to YC.",1308463519

5573718,comment,5573181,5573541,6,0,jacob019,,,"I think it's great.  No one is forcing anyone to upgrade, jQuery 1.9 is stable and you can use it forever even with new browsers.  So what if it's not supported after some unknown date in the future.  It's solid and will keep on working.  No one is forcing developers to switch, but in my case I don't want my users using older versions of IE.  We develop apps for in-house use, and breaking old insecure browsers is a good thing, it promotes user upgrades.  A smaller jQuery is great, as it will reduce load times a bit.  I couldn't be happier with the decision.",1366325976

If you're credible with your shoppers, they'll trust you more. I still believe that data can improve fit, but it may be better suited for a company like Everlane (that makes their own product) than Rewire Attire (that retails product).

Either way, the point isn't just that the government should be non-existent, or smaller for its own sake, but that it should allow the citizens to provide for their own welfare and provide the minimal in opposition to that.  The Republican mantra believes that people can and will fend for themselves, and either enjoy their own successes or failures with minimal intervention.<p>The democratic mantra is to provide a minimum standard for all, at the expense of those in excess of that standard.<p>It's a contrast in ideology, but neither is good or bad on its own.  Also worth noting is that over time, the parties have effectively flipped positions on matters entirely.  The Republicans, for example, freed the slaves despite FIERCE opposition by the democrats.  Nowadays, the Democrats generally carry the African-American vote.<p>In short, it's a popularity contest.

Do people STILL target IE 6? IE 8 is on ~10%[1] and at the current rate it's dropping at should be at 5% by October - Just in time for IE 11?<p>As for blaming XP, I'm not sure you can completely. IE 8 is the default browser of Windows 7 and XP has more than double the market share of IE 6/7/8 combined. Most IE users seem to be schools and companies that haven't upgraded. Although IE 6 will definitely be gone by April 2014, we could very well be stuck with IE 8 for a very long time.<p>For the record, IE 6 and 7 should be ignored completely. Combined they have a market share of less than 1%.<p>For a rule of thumb, I commonly drop support once a browser crosses 5%. Might seem high but usually once it's at that level, it's only going to keep falling.<p>Something to look forward to, my estimates[2] put Firefox 3.6, Safari 5/5.1 and IE 6/7/9 to all be gone by the start of 2014.

At about 3 months, I stopped using their docs for anything but cursory information: what methods does this class have of its own, what does it inherit, what is its class hierarchy, etc. That information is dynamically generated and typically spot on. The rest is generated by doc comments, and it's very hit or miss.<p>Instead, if I needed to know ANY details of a function, I clicked on the '.js' link on the right side of the page in the class hierarchy to load the .js file in the browser, then a quick cmd+f would show me what I needed to know, because I can parse consistently formatted JS faster than I can grok their vertically challenged documentation. JSDuck pulls inherited docs if function-level docs are omitted in a subclass, too, and sometimes they're just plain wrong because of that.<p>After about 6 months, I had committed to memory about 60% of Ext (all but the graphing bits, mainly, which I never used). I believe a good library is one that you don't need to worry about, ever. So naturally, being required to delve into Ext's source so often to me is unacceptable of something that is a paid product.<p>I would've been fine to fix so much in Ext, but it isn't developed in public via something like github, even though it's dual licensed, which meant the only way to do that was to post on their forums. No thanks. 4.x came a long way in rendering performance, but there were still critical paths that were untouched, including layout logic that determined when to perform layouts. They aren't required almost ever, but are used liberally, so while making the process faster is a benefit, the fundamental problem remains. A 200ms (for us, YMMV) layout problem was fixed (down to < 1ms) by a +5-0 change that added heuristics to determine when a layout was actually needed. This is a trivial change, and could be thrown in a PR at no cost.

5573512,comment,5572241,5572241,10,0,jules,,,"This kind of complaint applies to <i>any</i> method. Dimensional analysis just means that your data satisfies a certain kind of symmetry. A scaling symmetry in this case. It doesn't matter how long you define one meter, as long as you do it consistently. Hence any answer should not depend on the length of a meter. There are other symmetries, for example it does not matter where you put 0 on the temperature scale. Hence your answer should not depend on where you put that zero (unless that zero has special significance in your context). This is a kind of additive symmetry. Another additive symmetry is that it shouldn't matter which year you call year 0 (unless it has special significance, e.g. you are investigating the birth of jesus). In the same way your data can have any kind of symmetry, especially with multi-dimensional data you often get extra symmetries. For example it shouldn't matter in which direction you define north and east.<p>For any given problem, you should generally only use methods that obey the symmetries that your data has. This doesn't mean that PCA is invalid as a method, it's just only valid on a data where the scaling symmetry does not apply. Another example would be fitting a line through the origin for temperature data. That's invalid, because the result you get depends on where you define your zero (but as before, it might be valid if that zero has special significance in your context). Does that mean that fitting a line through the origin is invalid for any data set? No.<p>In other words, the same criticism could be applied to any given method. Just choose any symmetry that the method does not respect, and then declare it completely invalid. Hence we cannot dismiss a method outright purely based on this reasoning. For example PCA is perfectly valid on unitless data. What's even stranger is that the author does like neural neworks, which are certainly not dimensionally valid, heck they probably don't satisfy <i>any</i> real world symmetries. This is also a case where it can be OK to use a dimensionally inconsistent method. As long as it works, it works.",1366323432

Even if they were 99% sure that they had legit footage of possible suspects, why announce <i>that</i>, until they are good and ready (i.e. within an hour) to release them to the public? In fast-moving crime scenes, the strategy is usually to withhold as many facts of the crime from the public until a good suspect has been nabbed...among other things, this prevents people from claiming to have witnessed specifics when in fact, they only saw them on TV or heard about it in the news.<p>When a witness (or suspect) tells the police a fact that has been withheld from the public, that's a tool for the police to use to determine a witness's reliability.<p>In the case we have now, the suspected bombers have had at least 12 hours notice that the FBI had working images of them. Even if it were a complete bluff...what would be the point? Isn't it better to keep the suspects in as much ignorance as possible? It may be that at least one of them is dumb and complacent enough to think they've gotten away with it.<p>But this is a new age of news dissemination, so maybe the FBI was just flying by the seat of their pants. Part of me thinks that they did have a suspect/person of interest all this time (since yesterday's erroneous reports) and that this release is a partial ruse to flush out a co-conspirator (who, if he/she believes the press conference, thinks that the FBI has no one in custody yet).",1366322556

The sender needs to have an account with the originating bank, either Chase or Citi but the recipient can have an account anywhere with a routing number and account number. The bank facilitating the transfer will ask for ACH access to your receiving account and place some small transfers into your account. When you see those transfers they are like activation codes which you then use to validate that you are the owner of that account.<p>This certainly works in one off situations but I would love to see Citi or Chase productize this via an API for authorized merchants, etc.",1366322515

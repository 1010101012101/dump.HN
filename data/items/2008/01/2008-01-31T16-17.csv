107448,comment,107435,107435,0,0,mixmax,,,"Even if the recording industry manages to shut down Pirate Bay in Sweden they will just move their servers elsewhere. They have already demonstrated that they are capable of doing this -  last time they were raided by the police their servers were up and running in other countries within 24 hours.<p>And even if they manage to shut down the Pirate Bay completely something else will fill the gap within a month. Napster, Kazaa, e-mule, the list goes on...<p>Don't these people have anybody looking into new businees models? Their current one seems to revolve around suing their customers, and in the long term I somehow don't think that is a great strategy...<p>I don't necessarily agree that it is OK to steal copyrighted work, but seen from a business perspective they are digging their own grave. The world evolves, and industries that don't evolve with it will wither and eventually die.",1201798213

107444,comment,107297,107417,0,0,pchristensen,,,"I know, I love Google products and use them extensively, but they all trail their competitors.  Probably inertia where people won't change even though there's a much better, equally free alternative.  I think it comes from Google seeing a useful online service and building their own better version.  By the time Google's offering is up, users have already developed habits on other apps.<p>I guess rather than dysfunctional I meant ""relatively unpopular"".  The fact that you don't know a single hotmail user is a reflection of the kind of people you know, because hotmail and yahoo mail have multiple times more users than gmail.  Technical superiority doesn't always (or even usually) win.  Heck, IE7 crashes on my wife a couple times a day and she still refuses to use Firefox (which is installed on her computer with a copy of her bookmarks).<p>By behind, I <i>definitely</i> mean in # of users, not technologically.",1201797650

107436,comment,107187,107187,0,0,geebee,,,"Fractions vs Decimals was a big debate in my 5th grade classroom.  The teacher asked us, after showing us each way, which one we preferred.  The class was split.<p>At the time, I thought the debate was just about convenience in hand calculations - a mistaken notion that seems to be at the core of the link.  I didn't realize how conceptual fractions were until college, though, when I saw a proof in number theory that the square root of two can't be represented as the ratio of two integers.<p>It wasn't until real analysis that I started to understand why ""natural"" numbers like pi and euler's constant can't be represented through fractions (and why this is what you should expect), why factions can be counted but real numbers can't, and so forth.<p>Personally, I think kids need to learn fractions to get mentally ready for this sort of realization... but maybe that's just because that was my path toward understanding it. On a purely computational level... the symbolic reasoning needed for algebra and calculus (which isn't just math theory, but almost everything mathematical) is probably more related to mentally managing fractions than decimals (the quadratic equation, for example, uses the dividing line.  A decimal representation wouldn't be useful here, would it?)<p>All in all, kids probably need to understand that most numbers can only be approximated with fractions and decimals.",1201795613

Amazon&#x27;s big as far as e-commerce goes...but people bought things before, they can buy things from other websites, and they&#x27;ll continue to buy things even if Amazon didn&#x27;t exist.  Facebook somehow managed to get people to spend 2-3 hours/day throwing sheep at each other and give up all their personal information for targeted ads.<p>Zuckerburg&#x27;s genius isn&#x27;t that he&#x27;s a master technologist (I hear he&#x27;s pretty good, but that was never FaceBook&#x27;s core competency), it was that he realized social networking would be a billion dollar business long before anyone else did.  Google had competitors out within a year, but it never took those competitors seriously, and so 9 years on they are <i>still</i> struggling to play catch-up.<p>Probably nearly everyone on Hacker News could&#x27;ve built FaceBook in a weekend or so, in its original incarnation.

Google spends millions of dollars to ensure the security of the Google Mail platform. It also runs a public-facing bounty program --- one of the oldest and most reputable --- to solicit more vulnerabilities. It staffs a large and extremely well-regarded software security team to keep up with vulnerability classes and to research new ones.<p>Can you say the same thing about Fastmail.fm?",1371318879

When I did, I had started looking around to find out which companies have better contracts and who all people do not have such issues.  It was largely an empty set.  One big-name company had the contract optional with the condition that if you do not sign it when joining, you do not get bonus/stocks in the company during performance reviews (only the base salary and benefits).<p>I had also posed these questions to several wannabe founders as well as a few successful ones at YC Startup School and elsewhere.  Nearly all people in the first category had never read their contracts ever, while the people in the second category became tight-lipped right away and diverted the question.

I first understood this when I was an undergrad, and my EE professors assigned us homework involving Matlab.  The school had a license that allowed 50 concurrent users, <i>and the software enforced that</i>, which was a big problem when 80 students had homework to do.  Yes, the freedom to modify the software would have allowed anyone to circumvent this restriction, but the inability to modify the software does not imply that such a restriction must exist.<p>All of the four freedoms complement each other.  In a world without Freedom 0, you might be denied the freedom to modify your software, because you might not be able to run the software <i>needed</i> to modify other software (e.g. imagine a simple world where all software is distributed as Python source, but where your text editor is designed to not be able to edit such source, and where your OS is designed to not run any other text editors -- modifying your software suddenly becomes much harder).",1371318710

Invoke a terrifying internal and external enemy\n2. Create secret prisons where torture takes place\n3. Develop a thug caste or paramilitary force not answerable to citizens\n4. Set up an internal surveillance system\n5. Harass citizens&#x27; groups\n6. Engage in arbitrary detention and release\n7. Target key individuals\n8. Control the press\n9.

NTP does not use time zones so I am not sure what that has to do with anything.<p>Exit nodes forging ntp responses? That is going to be pretty tough. Last time I checked tor has a tcp fetish and ntp is squarely in the udp camp.<p>I checked the reddit link. Lets skip over the fact that you said &quot;identify a client&quot; and the reddit link is about hidden services. In order to work it requires that the hidden service serves http, serves http over plain ipv4, and  is running on a computer that is also a relay. So that is not &quot;simple&quot; but most importantly it has very little to do with ntp requests.<p>I&#x27;m not going to lie, I stopped reading the whonix documentation after the first three paragraphs  and i have pasted them below:<p><pre><code>  Don&#x27;t wonder... To prevent against time zone leaks, the system clock\n  inside Whonix was set to UTC. This means it may be a few hours before\n  or ahead of your host system clock. Do not change!\n\n  On the host. If you were a user of TorBOX 0.2.1 or below and removed\n  NTP, restore it now.\n\n    sudo apt-get install ntpd\n</code></pre>\nCan you see why I stopped reading when I did?

If you are out after 8 years, what is the motivation for a 50 year economic plan?<p>As the Chinese move more and more in to capitalism, and its people grow richer, they will want a say, and some power. As that happens, China will slowly feed in democratic mechanisms, as it has capitalist ones. It will have no choice, and it knows that. China will incresingly have more to lose and more international assets to protect, so its military will grow, as will it&#x27;s navy. As Chinese influence and world investment grows, the likes of the USA will lose power and influence, and grow more an more concerned. As we have seen, that fear and paranoia will lead to more and more loss of freedom and democracy. So as China becomes more like America, America will become more like China is now.<p>The USA needs a long term plan to meet that challenge, and find a working equilibrium.

Perhaps ultimately the ethics behind the value of privacy can be traced to its role in constructing a society that produces the best quality of life for people.<p>If so then it may start with whether hurting someone can defuse a ticking bomb, then be expanded to whether hurting more people can undermine an enemy and whether it yields less accurate information than subtler interrogation methods, or perhaps whether it recruits more enemies and is a losing strategy, and some many steps later, after addressing whether it undermines the fundamental goals that make the society worth protecting, what kind of people it makes us to engage in torture.<p>I suppose that what I am getting at is that we wouldn&#x27;t necessarily agree with the values that informed past ideas about what is moral.

They have a very focused job to do. Breaking a crypt system or something is a very focused effort. Youits really intense. So its really something thats really compatible with their character. And so, when something happens and they see things happening to people who get involved, like myself or others, they get afraid. And being introverts, they even go further asfurther into themselves and staying isolated. So, thatsthats the primary character of people. And the others, the others are probably part of it and believe that its the correct thing to do. And they dont try to find a reasonable, constitutionally acceptable, legally acceptable way to do theto achieve the objectives that they want.

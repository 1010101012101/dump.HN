So if you make a gizmo in the goods economy, and price it outside of the demand line, they sit on the shelf and you go broke.<p>Of course in the goods economy you had a cost of making the item, sure there was R&D and advertising Etc. but each good also has some raw materials so you really can't sell them below a certain price or you lose your shirt.<p>In the information economy you get this weird artifact. Your 'good' gets copied and distributed without remuneration. This appears to be lost sales, but in fact it is simply that your good is priced outside the demand curve for those buyers. What is even stranger is that you can lower your price all the way to zero if you choose because the marginal cost to make a new one is zero. This gives you tremendous pricing leverage in the info economy and people who use it well typically price high for novelty value early, then lower to capture the larger market, and then lower still to pick up the remnant market. The cost of R&D, marketing, etc can be amortized over all of these and if you look at it as an integral value function you can actually make reasonable pricing decisions.<p>Of course old school media doesn't get the 'info' economy any more than telling a teenager that the 'fair' price is one that someone will pay even if they think it is too high.<p>Over time these concepts are making themselves known in the mainstream but it does take waaaay more time than it does to innovate so it seems like its not changing at all.",1330231542

Should we ignore mistakes made at the whiteboard because someone was under time pressure?<p>Sure, most software engineers (aye, even Google software engineers) are not under significant pressure on an average day.  We get to work in the morning, we sit down at our desks, we hack on our code with our 30"" monitors and customized editors, and we go home.  It's a nice job, really.<p>But there are occasions when engineers are under pressure.  There are deadlines.  There are revenue-impacting bugs that need to be fixed while millions of dollars are at stake.  There are segfaults in some new code you just deployed and the SRE team that's getting paged at 3am is threatening to burn your house down if you don't fix it before the weekend.  Time pressure is not utterly foreign to a software engineer's life, and it's not unreasonable to do what we can to see how an engineer will function under such pressure.  An engineer who can only properly function sitting at a desk with his 30"" monitor filled with vim instances and ample time on his clock is lacking some measure of flexibility and capability that we reasonably expect to find in the best engineers.<p>No, we don't forget what it's like to be an interview candidate.

Then again, I'm not really sure you can reliably make programmers with a substantial degree of success.  In my undergrad CS program, we had 300 freshman at the start, and I graduated with 29 others at the end.  For people with a CS undergrad, an MS program is quite good.  They shore up on depth and theory that they didn't get while working on their programming chops in undergrad.<p>Sadly, if you can't already program, you can get a master's in CS (because it's focused on depth and theory instead of programming), it's just completely useless.  I have no idea what one can do with a MS-CS, if they can't program.  It's honestly a little heartbreaking for me, that people to spend 2 years of their lives wasting it on that.<p>With all that said, I haven't found any degree (at least from any school I've interviewed applicants for) to be a reliable signal for programming.  Even if they went to a really good school, there's a good chance that they spent all their time learning network protocols and low-level mechanisms, and will happily write up a sliding-window implementation for me, but will stare at me blankly when I ask for a simple recursive algorithm.

Given the established precedent of providing feedback, what is Alice to do? We have a precedent in play. Would you want your employees telling candidates that they did a rubbish job?

Whenever you give project managers responsibility for hiring for their own projects they'll take the best candidate in the pool, even if that candidate is sub-standard for the company, because every manager wants some help for their project rather than no help.

3634805,comment,3633405,3633405,2,0,leephillips,,,"<p><pre><code>   I attended Stuyvesant in 1973-76, which I learn from this article was
   the era of the highest black enrollment. I have a few quibbles: the
   article states that admission was solely by test score. In fact, one of
   my best (black) friends at Stuyvesant sheepishly told me that he
   scored somewhat below the cutoff but was admitted as part of a
   program to admit students from disadvantaged backgrounds with lower
   scores. He was sheepish because he knew that I knew that he was in
   fact quite wealthy and was from a privileged background. His
   father was a famous radio personality. But the system treated him as
   a member of a disadvantaged group because of his complexion.

   The article says Students take the exam in October of their eighth-grade
   year. Many students who will wind up at Stuyvesant never go
   to eighth grade. Like me, they are placed in an accelerated
   junior high program that consists of seventh and ninth grades only.
   Also, the article refers repeatedly to middle school. The first
   time I heard this term was after I moved away from New York.

   The article refers to free preparatory programs. Never heard of
   them, nor any other type of test preparation or practice. The test
   resembles an SAT. If you know English and your junior high math, its
   not that difficult to get in to Stuyvesant, frankly. I know this
   because I was not very good at taking tests, and was somewhat
   surprised that I got in.


   A bigger obstacle is the desire to go there. Most American students
   dont want to face a year each of physics, biology, and chemistry,
   math up to (and optionally including) calculus, and much more,
   including economics, metal shop, and drafting. It might not sound
   like much to the Germans and Japanese, but it does not resemble the
   typical American highschool curriculum. I was shocked to meet people
   in college whose mathematical knowledge seemed to stop at what I had
   learned in 10th grade and who had never heard of mitochondria.  All
   this, and the nerd stigma, was what kept my siblings, for example,
   from taking the test and settling for our abysmal neighborhood
   school. Note that most of Stuyvesants population consists of the
   offspring of immigrants, who seem to appreciate the importance of
   education.</code></pre>",1330230132

These amounts are enough to get anyone's attention. I've bought many $100K+ value domains for $15K-$20K by starting with a $5K or $7K offer.<p>By starting with at least something that gets their attention they will take you seriously.

I have a domain name in mind that I'd like to buy; it's a four-letter nonsense word, but easy to pronounce and spell (2 soft consonants, 2 vowels, not nec in that order). My question: is this a ""great domain"" for which $5k - $10k should be the starting point, or is it more akin to one of those ""decent 2 word domains"" for which you could start with $1k to $2.5k?",1330230057

If you watch ""R-rated"" depictions of brutal violence, the probability that you will be adversely psychologically (or socially) affected by those depictions is pretty close to zero. This is not because you have committed acts of brutal violence yourself, but rather because you are capable of dealing with such things in a mature and rational way. Similarly, the argument here is not that high-schoolers will be unaffected by this film because they have practised the behaviour depicted therein, but because they have dealt with it and understand the implications of such behaviour.<p>Language is a particularly important case because people outside the school system (and even some inside it) tend to believe that children are unspoilt bundles of verbal innocence, whereas in reality the sort of language practised on a day-to-day basis by your average 13-year-old is probably considerably more offensive than the language used in this film. It's ironic that a film like this one should be crushed by the very veil of ignorance which it attempts to lift - social norms change, and the MPAA can't expect to be able to stick its head in the sand and assume that a ratings system based on a fairly static set of ""family values"" will be relevant forever.",1330229907

Sure its great when you love your business partners but I dont find it that big of a deal, especially when it came from Kevin's mouth (as with any other show they put totally character-contrast cast to make things spicy - Kevin vs Barbara, i.e.)<p>You have to learn about him to understand what kind of deals he is performing. He is amazing on selling anything to everyone even if its ice to Eskimo. In his example he had some huge, hm poisoned water delivered here and there :) [1] But I give him credit for fucking up software deal to Matel and having huge balls to being proud of it and shoving it in everyones face (at least on the show: his favorite quote was something like ""millions of dollars? thats a rounding error, a statistical noise in deals i have been doing!""). Don't get me wrong: the guy is a genius at making money and just proves that you will get dirty by making plenty of money. I would like to live his live, sure, but definitely wouldn't like to die as Kevin, given you believe in things like God, Heaven and Hell.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_OLeary_(entrepreneur)#Controversies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_OLeary_(entrepreneur)#Con...</a>",1330228930

For developers, the data show clearly open offices are productivity killers. Some people may <i>like</i> them, but that doesn&#x27;t make those people more productive.<p>So what are the areas where open offices plausibly improve business function?<p>Employee retention? This is possible, as some people clearly have a preference for them, but based on comments in this and other threads the people who hate them hate the a lot, while the people who like them aren&#x27;t nearly so zealous.<p>Productivity? The data show this is clearly not the case.<p>&quot;Communication&quot;? I put this in quotes because I&#x27;m not sure what it means, although it gets touted as a benefit of open offices. Private offices and short meetings with small numbers of people result in good communications within and across teams, and I&#x27;m not sure what barrier to communication is imposed by being unable to interrupt the person three desks over (and distract everyone in between) that can&#x27;t be solved by a simple messenger app.<p>Scalability?

9601196,comment,9600885,9600885,0,0,aspir,,,"Contrary to popular belief, angels have no incentive to steal an idea they&#x27;ve been pitched on. More accurately, doing so is a net negative.<p>Angels do a few things well: quickly vet a flood (sometimes dozens a day) of inbound deals to back with a tiny investment, and support the companies that have found product market fit after the first investment. Both of these sound trivial, but it&#x27;s difficult to do in practice and both are incredibly valuable. The vast majority of angels are either not good at building things, or they&#x27;re too busy/exhausted to do so with their time. If they were, they&#x27;d become entrepreneurs, or join as an exec in the most successful startup they backed. Also, the great networks that angel investors provide are on the business side. Angels expect you, the technical founder, to have the technical network and skills to hire and build product.<p>So, angels exist to source good deals, and support the winners as they surface. This is their lifeblood. To steal an idea is a cardinal sin in the angel community as much as the entrepreneur community. They&#x27;d be outcast, removed from deal flow, and their career as a seed investor would cease to exist. If we assume that the majority of business ideas are flawed, and the majority of startups die, then for an angel investor to steal an idea makes no sense: they&#x27;d be effectively ending their careers for little upside.<p>On a more humorous note: being an angel is an easy life compared to building a business, let alone building a business off of someone else&#x27;s idea. Any angel that would give up an easy life that makes money for a hard life of executing an idea they aren&#x27;t passionate about, and a life with a high risk of failure, is an idiot.",1432580019

And ofc, rewrite all the applications to live in a world where we dont have <1ms connectivity to everything.<p>I would say that I currently spend a couple of hours/month actually working on CF fixing bugs, trouble shooting etc. Rest of the time I can work on other stuff, so I would not really factor in my salary to much into the equation.<p>We get compute and flash storage for &quot;free&quot; from other projects(massive SAP and other back office installations wont go away anytime soon).

All of the professors with whom I corresponded said that universities were full to the brim with Soviet literature courses in the sixties, but interest took a nose dive once Russia ceased to be the Evil Empire.&quot;<p>This is supposedly the reason?  When I was in school, I was not required to read any Russian Liturature.  I didnt care at the time, I was working towards a business degree, with a minor in biology.  My writting skills, and use of the English language was, and still is atrocious; I ended up taking most the required English, and Literature courses my last semester.<p>My first introduction to Russian Liturature was years later.  I checked out Lolita by Valadimire Nabokov.  I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  Well, after reading the book, I finally appreciated good writing.  I found his writing beautiful, and easy to read.  I wonder why some of his work wasn&#x27;t required reading.  I wish I was forced to read at least one of his books in high school, or college.(I understand why a high school english teacher wouldn&#x27;t even mention Lolita.  It wouldn&#x27;t be worth the backlash, but his other books are appropriate?).<p>As to why I wasn&#x27;t introduced to any Russian Liturature, I always thought it was due to the Mcarthy Era--where anything remotely related to socialism/communism was career ending?  And, professors remember what their predecessors went through, and just decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it.  Stick with the safe stuff politically?   I assumed, today, Russian Literature, at least some authors, were required reading in most American college Lit. departments?  I had no idea, the students were the one&#x27;s whom showed no interest in Russian literature?  Are their any recent English, Lit. majors who would chime in?

That is, there is just enough balance that one player cannot force a win by themselves, but there are otherwise gross imbalances in player power, and it is up to the players to maintain balance through temporary alliances and inevitable backstabbing. From my many plays of Cosmic Encounter, it does seem that the player with the strongest position does not win very much more often than others.<p>There are downsides to the design: one, it&#x27;s hostile to new players who don&#x27;t have enough knowledge of the game (this is true of any skill based multiplayer game, but in games like CE the effect of an unskilled player on the game can be profoundly wonky). The other issue I have is that players with a weak initial position have to win through negotiations, and so have fewer paths to victory than the players in powerful initial positions. I rarely ever see the &quot;weak&quot; player win in Cosmic Encounter (whereas the moderately-powerful and very-powerful players seem to have about equal chance at winning if they&#x27;re playing competently).",1432579361

9601128,comment,9600717,9600717,0,0,scottLobster,,,"Seems that article is more about interfaces for the handicapped than anything specific to the elderly; probably because being elderly in general doesn&#x27;t preclude one from technology.  In my experience it&#x27;s the elderly people who have no desire to learn something new that are the issue.  My GF&#x27;s dad is in his 70s and uses his iPhone, iPad and laptop regularly with no issues, because he embraced technology years ago, uses it every day and is open to learning how to use it.  His wife on the other hand is a little more &quot;set in her ways&quot; and intentionally avoids technology aside from a few things like Facetime and Plants vs Zombies, and as such runs into a lot of everyday issues that she doesn&#x27;t know how to deal with and just waves them over to him or me or the nearest Apple Genius.<p>Technology being &quot;impenetrable&quot; is not a trait only applied to the elderly.  It&#x27;s initially &quot;impenetrable&quot; to everyone when they first start using it, whether that be at age 3 or age 80.  Learning to use technology well comes with experience like anything else, and those many elderly people who have attained some technical proficiency are proof of this.  If someone doesn&#x27;t want to put forth that effort then they shouldn&#x27;t feel patronized when the interface assumes the lowest common denominator.<p>Now designing for medical issues and handicaps that may or may not come with age is another issue.  I&#x27;m all for medical accessibility, but I&#x27;d divorce that issue from &quot;designing for the elderly&quot;, on the grounds of over-generalization.

Microcontrollers are designed specifically (physically, instruction set, cost) to control low-level digital and analog IO, and not to run a general Operating System.<p>Raspberry Pi etc are general purpose computers. They only differ from your general laptop etc in form factor, and that they&#x27;re built around a System on a Chip (SoC) rather than discrete CPU and peripherals. In that regard it&#x27;s much like your cell phone, tablet, Chromebook and other budget laptop/desktop computers. But general computers are moving in that direction too — on-chip graphics, ethernet etc. Because RPi targets education and hobbyists, its form factor exposes some general purpose IO (GPIO) pins, much like a general computer parallel port might.<p>As far as I know, Raspberry Pi doesn&#x27;t have ADC on-board, but you can wire an external one into its digital GPIO/SPI pins. You could also plug a USB or serial port ADC into your laptop, or your RPi.<p>With regard to “physical computing”, there&#x27;s generally a real-time requirement, which cannot be achieved with a multi-tasking OS. Microcontrollers generally run at less then 100 MHz (often 8 or 16 MHz), but because of their instruction set design, timer and interrupt systems, and lack of multitasking, they can reliably and rapidly sample inputs or trigger outputs. A 48 MHz microcontroller could perhaps come close to 1 MHz sample rate.<p>SoC devices and general purpose computers are designed to run a multi-tasking OS at GHz speed with heaps of RAM. But despite that, this example shows an inability to reliably control I/O at more than 100 KHz when running a general (multitasking) OS.

I also note that the Intelligence Agencies aren&#x27;t above lying to Congress (whether behind closed doors or in public hearings), to the DoJ, the Supreme Court, the President, or anyone else for that matter.<p>> Also... &quot;prohibited&quot;? By whom?<p>Uh, <i>actually</i> prohibited by long-standing Federal law? USC Title 18, Section 793, and Section 798 totally apply here. Congressmen are <i>NOT</i> immune from prosecution that stems from their disclosure of classified information that they receive firsthand.[0] What&#x27;s more, the Speech or Debate clause <i>only</i> protects Congressmen from arrest and detention while performing their official duties. It <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> shield Congressmen from prosecution stemming from illegal acts performed while acting as Congressmen.<p>So, no, Federal agencies can&#x27;t prevent[1] Congressmen from revealing directly-disclosed-to-the-congressman classified information on the debate floor. But then, a Congressman can&#x27;t protect himself from prosecution, fines, and jail time after the big reveal.<p>[0] Remember that the Pentagon Papers were sent to a Congressman by a newspaper. Generally speaking, disclosure of classified information that&#x27;s in the public interest by a person who is not under an obligation to control access to said information is a protected activity, as is disclosure of classified info by the press.<p>[1] Though, they can directly discourage it by limiting cooperation with Committees and access to personnel. This would clearly be a roadblock, rather than a permanent obstruction, but it would probably serve as a permanent obstruction to dispassionate Congressmen.",1432578656

It seems likely that you could find a number of areas where open offices look statistically better, and a number of areas where they look worse.<p>It also seems likely to me that open offices are more likely to be poorly executed than private rooms (there&#x27;s a lot more rope to hang yourself with). That&#x27;s all the more reason for us to have more nuanced discussions about it.<p>As an example, most people on HN are singularly focused on what makes for a good office for programmers. My startup is made up mostly of non-programmers, and all programmers are allowed to work remotely. So basically, my goals might not be the same as yours, and one-size-fits-all advice is too simplistic.<p>Another example: In our office everyone&#x27;s primary desk is in the open workspace, but we also have enough private rooms that 100% of our team can work from those at the same time if they want. So no one <i>has</i> to work from the open office, and yet most people choose to. I&#x27;d guess that open offices are viewed much more favorably when they&#x27;re not the only option.",1432578654

9601101,comment,9599976,9600930,0,0,zokier,,,"I&#x27;d say the difference between Arduino and RPi is far greater than the difference between RPi and vanilla PC.<p>RPi is very much just a computer with couple GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins exposed. RPi runs pretty much the same Linux as your PC would. Indeed RPi originally was designed to allow school pupils to have cheap access to Ubuntu and LibreOffice and whatnot, the maker community thing was kinda just a sideproduct of that. This class of devices are commonly called single-board computers.<p>Arduino on the other hand is designed to run your code on bare metal and typically does not involve operating system of any sort. That means that you got very direct access to the HW, and also that you generally have fairly solid hard realtime guarantees. Arduinos also have orders of magnitude less resources (memory/compute/storage) available than RPi but also consume order(s?) of magnitude less power. I&#x27;d call this class devboards.<p>One relatively important distinction between the two is that RPi class devices can be considered self-hosting in the sense that you can program the devices on the device itself without another computer, whereas Arduino development generally always requires a host computer that programs (&quot;flashes&quot;) the device.",1432578597
9601100,comment,9598333,9600889,0,0,joesmo,,,"This is certainly the way it <i>used</i> to be, but nowadays any musician can buy enough equipment to get started in any genre even if they&#x27;re making very little money. With a few hundred and definitely a couple thousand dollars, anyone with the will to do it can put together a &quot;bedroom studio&quot; that will rival any record label in production quality. There is little to no value in an artist taking $50k in debt (as unlikely as the scenario is to be in the first place) for production. So that only leaves marketing and promotion, which allegedly the labels do, but in reality, they only do it for their highest grossing artists, if that. Or the artist could save up one or two thousand, buy their own equipment, produce whatever tracks they want, and get just about as much promotion and marketing from the labels as if they were signed (asymptotical to zero). So my question does indeed still stand. As far as your Eminem example, Eminem came out in the late 90&#x27;s when self-production was not quite affordable yet and was just starting to reach quality on par with professional studios. He&#x27;s also one of the most extremely talented rappers so comparing him to someone that isn&#x27;t on his level easily explains the discrepancy between the two.",1432578586

9601048,comment,9573735,9575427,0,0,jnape,,,"Whew, lots of good feedback here. Clearly I should have checked back earlier; I didn&#x27;t realize there would be so much discussion. Excellent! Points addressed inline.<p>> First of all, Kolmogorov complexity talks about the output from programs at a &quot;higher-level&quot;. For example, to define the Kolmogorov complexity of plain text, we must talk about programs which output text. To define Kolmogorov complexity of, say, Ruby code, we must talk about programs which output Ruby code. And so on. The author mixes up the complexity of the text (eg. in the 3 line example) with the complexity of the code. These are two different things: the complexity of the text depends on the shortest program which outputs that text; the complexity of the code depends on the shortest program which outputs that code.<p>Unequivocally true, and probably illustrative of the primary reason my article failed to express my intent, which was to illustrate Kolmogorov complexity as a useful measurement in reconciling the complexity of an algorithm (as expressed, say, in some natural spoken language, like English) with the complexity of its implementation: or, more precisely, how uniformly symmetrical some implementation which models an algorithm is to the algorithm itself. Perhaps it was too great of a leap to name Kolmogorov complexity as the conduit for this, but it seemed much closer than other similar textual comparison mechanisms (like, say, Hamming distance, which has its own interesting, but completely different, implications in comparing source code revisions).<p>For example, in a language that supports pattern matching in function definitions, you could, in theory, implement a 2-arity addition function by defining all permutations of two 32-bit signed integers. This is, of course, an incredibly unhelpful implementation, not only in general comprehension and understanding (who&#x27;s going to memorize the outputs of 2^64 function definitions?) but also in deriving the intent of the solution (in this case, the rules of addition). I find too often our implementations tend to focus on varieties of knowing &quot;2 plus 2 equals 4&quot;, rather than understanding the nature of the solution, and was trying to use Kolmogorov complexity as a heuristic for identifying the relative complexity of two implementations to discover the one that is more general and correct. Perhaps that was too much of a leap.<p>> Secondly, writing different programs with the same output doesn&#x27;t change the Kolmogorov complexity; it merely improves an approximation (since Kolmogorov complexity is undecidable, we must approximate it). The author also uses the word &quot;count&quot; when talking about these approximate numbers, which I think is better than calling them &quot;complexity&quot;.<p>Again, this is absolutely true, although given that complexity is undecidable, it seemed convenient to synonymize &quot;complexity&quot; with &quot;approximate complexity&quot;. Given this feedback, however, perhaps I&#x27;ll update the article to attempt to clarify this distinction (possibly using &quot;count&quot; more, as that seems to have struck accord).<p>> 1) When comparing different languages, like Ruby and Python, it might be nice to point out that the complexity can only change by a constant amount. This is because, in the worst possible scenario, we can write an interpreter for the other language. For example, if we use Python as our meta-language, we can denote the complexity of some text T as P(T); if we switch to using Ruby instead, the complexity R(T) <= P(T) + I, where I is the complexity of a Python interpreter written in Ruby. Since I doesn&#x27;t depend on T, it is a constant, and therefore the choice of language becomes less important as the complexity of T increases.<p>Great point! I&#x27;d also add that it&#x27;s useful to understand the magnitude of I between languages, as that could (and should) be a contributing factor when choosing the language most appropriate for the problem.<p>2) Using Kolmogorov complexity as a benchmark doesn&#x27;t seem like a great idea to me. [...]<p>It can certainly be taken too far! I tried to caveat the article at the end, illustrating some of the pitfalls of making it the One True Metric, e.g. introducing artificial abstractions. Of course, this can extend to incidental language idiosyncrasies that can be exploited to shorten implementations. I was attempting to bring focus to subjective clarity as the final ruling metric, using Kolmogorov as assistance on the journey.<p>> Just look at <a href=""http://codegolf.stackexchange.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codegolf.stackexchange.com</a> for example ;)<p>I actually referenced code golf in the footnotes as a correlative example of refactorings based solely on Kolmogorov complexity. It&#x27;s a double edged sword: some of my most profound &quot;aha!&quot; moments came from code golf exercises, although the vast majority of the time I just end up frowning at the non-obvious nature of the final winning submissions.<p>Hopefully my responses are more clear than the article was, although I fear they perhaps were not. Thanks for the very thoughtful and measured feedback!",1432577718

But this study does not prove it.<p>I wish scientists would be more straightforward about conclusions.

One option to avoid this is to get rid of status indicators, though that is inelegant and means the message would have to sit on the server at least until it expired. I&#x27;m not too concerned with the messages sitting on the server, because if the message passes through the server, then they could be storing it either way, and I&#x27;m already trusting that they will do that responsibly. Well, at the very least, trusting them to do that responsibly as long as there is no algorithm for faster large prime factorization, and the message is unreadable to them anyway. Expiration timers could be deliberately very short, which would reduce server load. I would personally allow the expiration timer to be user-set, because I believe the average security conscious person is going to want the timer to be short, unless there is a reason for the message to hang around.<p>Of course, this doesn&#x27;t completely address the issue. It would still be theoretically possible to check for connections to the server, and determine online/offline status just from whether the messages are going out immediately after being sent in. Even generating fake data might not be enough to completely reduce that theoretically possible to the realm of technically impossible. It&#x27;s still a risk to keep in mind.

I think novels like Cement and How the Steel was Tempered are hard sells in the classroom. And Quiet Flows the Don is so long.<p>Having said that, a well-designed cultural studies course in literature, painting, sculpture, film, and propaganda would be amazing, and I think would be intellectually stimulating.<p>Maybe like this: <a href=""http://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course_details.xml?courseid=006292&term=1154"" rel=""nofollow"">http://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course_detai...</a>",1432576870

I have much better things to do with my time besides fabricating elaborate stories on the public Internet.  Not trying to be defensive, but just saying that not everything on the Internet is rubbish.<p>I do however respect your opinion and view as an individual.

This is the best explanation I&#x27;ve been able to find for how to use From, instead of Into.<p>One thing that&#x27;s useful about From is that you can implement From<SomePublicStruct> for YourPrivateStruct, but the compiler complains about Into<YourPrivateStruct> for SomePublicStruct.<p>SomePublicStruct could be (i32, i32) and YourPrivateStruct could be MyPoint, for example.<p>Making YourPrivateStruct public (with pub struct) fixes things, but that&#x27;s not always what you want.",1432576820

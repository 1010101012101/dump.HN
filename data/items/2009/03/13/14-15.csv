It seems that getting hired by (say) Google is even more impressive now than a few years ago.<p>Another thing that worries me is that there are no IPOs anymore, so the only options for small businesses are to stay small (and unimportant) or sell the business to a large corporation (making them even stronger). And with more regulations and bailouts from the government, corporations might just be getting stronger than ever. I hope it is not true, I'll be happy if you prove me wrong.",1236953841
514876,comment,514541,514541,0,0,kaiserama,,,"I have used PayPal and Google Checkout on a site, if you sign up for the business/payments pro version of PayPal you'll be able to collect payments in 2 ways on your site.  Either via PayPal payment, or credit card.  The credit card payment can be transparent to the user if you are either using a shopping cart with PayPal integrated or if you know how to program against the PP API, or can transfer to PP and complete a CC transaction there.  The Google Checkout option will require the purchaser to have a Google Checkout Account. This is typically a slight deterrent as it requires someone to create a new account which can sometimes be considered a PITA.<p>Either way many sites typically support multiple payment methods.  But if you're talking about small transaction sizes you may want to do some research into micro payment processors.  Not sure how far along they are but one that had been mentioned a long long time ago was NOCA.  Think the site is NOCA.com.  But there are others.<p>Good luck.<p>oh and yes there are always premiums involved.  If you go with PP the fee for payments pro is like $20/mo + ~3% + $.30/transaction.

I can sit in it for extended periods of time and not have much fatigue or get sweaty like I can with some of those pleather chairs that you have to assemble when you get them home.  2, for the many many number of ways you can adjust the chair.  I'm curious if the ones you've been sitting on are the basic model or have the lumbar, arm adjustments, etc.  Also they come in 3 different sizes and getting the right sized model is actually pretty important.<p>I also find them much more comfortable to sit in but this could be because I have a medium sized frame and because I prefer sitting leaning back.<p>Either way like noodle said, it doesn't really matter what anyone else says, if you don't like the aeron skip it.

Refutability is one of the classic determinants of whether a theory can be called scientific.<p>>>This falsifiability criterion is what determines whether a theory is scientific, but there is a larger category of theories which are not all empirically testable yet are subject to rational criticism, and are therefore rational, though we must generally hold them with a lower degree of confidence than we do our scientific theories.<p>The essence of anti-intellectualism is when we say that there are subjects that are too deep or too laborious to discuss.  Suppose we say that (1) empiricism is not empirically testable, and then say that (2) empiricism is true, and then say that (3) everything that is true must be testable. Now suppose someone were to come along and say that (4) It is the case that (1) and (3) are mutually exclusive.  The shying away from statements/discussions like (4) is the essence of anti-intellectualism which spawns from all manner of modern philosophical beliefs.

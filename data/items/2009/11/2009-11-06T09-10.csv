Having ideas is like having to paint, or blog or anything other that is creative that is a drive outside of yourself.  You literally can't control it.<p>And if in all those ideas there is <i>ONE</i> golden one and it is recognized as such amichail will be the one to reap the benefits from that.<p>HN is a great place to get criticism for your 'stupid' ideas, and it isn't always the smart ideas that end up making you money.<p>If I look at my own history it is the stupid ideas that made be lots of $ and the intricate and lots of work stuff is what gave me great intellectual satisfaction but ended up losing literally buckets of money.<p>Give the guy a break, there is room enough for everyone here.<p>One of the reasons these 'niche' HNs seem to fail is simply because of the lack of volume and requiring the potential audience to monitor yet another website.<p>If amichail were to take his 'idea fountain' elsewhere I for one would miss him, and I would consider it a loss to all of us.<p>A couple of years ago I guy I knew was bugging everybody about his idea for 'foldable storage boxes'. He eventually made a cardboard model, and couldn't stop talking about it. The follow-up was dreadful, it never went anywhere. Fast forward 10 years, he's back at it, only now he's gotten this idea that maybe he can make them larger, so that trucks that drive south with flowers can use these boxes on the way there, and fold them up on the way back so they can carry payload both ways, instead of driving back with empty flower racks. Oh, and of course everybody was telling him he's nuts.<p>Same basic idea, took well upwards of 10 years for the coin to drop. I would not be surprised at all if amichail is like that guy. He takes a shower, comes back out and can literally fill 10 pages of his 'notebook' with ideas.<p>99% of them are crap, and everybody keeps telling him.<p>I wished I had his banking problems though...",1257498554

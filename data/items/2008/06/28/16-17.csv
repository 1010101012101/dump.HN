They interviewed a bunch of millionaires to figure out how these people got rich. Visibly they came up with bunch of traits. You need a little bit of intelligence, a lot of hard work, and a lot of risk-taking. And they derived that, hey, taking risk is good for you if you want to become a millionaire. What these people forgot to do is to go take a look at the less visible cemetery — in other words, bankrupt people, failures, people who went out of business — and look at their traits. They would have discovered that some of the same traits are shared by these people, like hard work and risk taking. This tells me that the unique trait that the millionaires had in common was mostly luck."" - Nassim Taleb<p>Gladwell's previous work on genius isn't that promising either: <a href=""http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2007/05/gladwell-and-genius.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2007/05/gladwell-and-genius.htm...</a><p>Finally, I doubt that the book will be better than this: <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/2926754/The-Mundanity-of-Excellence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/2926754/The-Mundanity-of-Excellenc...</a>",1214669180

Well, decided may be the wrong word... let's call it a happy accident that it happened that way.<p>Now that we've had this flow live for a few months, I can't think of a reason a small startup would possibly ask for credit card information up front.<p>Pros:<p>- We have one of the lowest barriers to entry to our app. Literally 10 seconds and you have a fully functional install.<p>- We have lowered the amount of people complaining about us accidentally charging them (i.e. they forget about the 30-day trial and ask for a refund at day 31) to zero.<p>- We've opened up a lot more channels for follow up.  We can contact people weeks/months after their trial expires and see if they'd like an extension or to try again. (In other words, we've removed the negative parts of trying the product -- cancelling)<p>Cons:<p>- It's lowered our conversion rate (remember what rate means) and made it extremely unpredictable.<p>- We don't get to steal as much money from people who forget to cancel their subscriptions.<p>At the end of the day, I believe in our product and I want as many people to try it as possible.  A credit card form isn't going to stop someone from purchasing a product (unless it's <i>really</i> bad), but it sure does stop a lot of people from trying out a product.

Personally, I try to stay away from prototypical objects unless the style fits very cleanly with what I'm trying to do. Otherwise,the best way I've found to keep my sanity is to pick whatever language you're developing the backend with, and use as many conventions you've established there as possible.<p>For me, this means my Javascript looks more like Python -- it can be a little weird, but switching between the frontend and the backend is easier that way.<p>I'd also recommend using objects as namespaces if you're not dealing with prototypical objects.  It makes grepping easier - you can search for 'Graphs.init' instead of 'init' in this example:<p>var Graphs = {<p><pre><code>    state_variable: null, // store global state somehow\n\n    init: function() {\n        // Some initialization code\n    },\n\n    refresh: function(img_element, url) {\n        // some code to refresh the src url\n    }</code></pre>\n};",1253593199

As the other guy said before you just created a business not a startup. You are an entrepreneur. Good for you. I don't see why you have to denigrate the people trying to change the status quo. Nor do I see why you took an aggressive posture to promote your site.<p>As such, I have flagged you for two reasons: you are going against the civil nature that the site was created to foster and the fact that you are plain wrong about the lack of credit we give to the other ""soft"" sciences such as business development, selling, and interpersonal relations. There are plenty of those submitted and promoted to the front page.<p>I do wish you good luck with your site though.",1253592437

Being older and seeing life a bit differently I see martial arts differently as well. I stumbled across a new show where I was surprised to see childhood action-hero Steven Seagal as a real sheriff. It's a good example to me of the real, rather than tv side, of martial arts, and I'd probably study Aikido if I got into something.

1156926,comment,1156356,1156907,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Im not sure that is the case for <i>controversial</i> theories. Just take a look at the differing opinions on quantum theory (especially the argument over light quanta) and atomic structure in the past. That was pretty black/white for many years (by which I mean you had scientists very staunchly on both sides of the theories).<p>This black/white scenario is ripe for corruption by a (political) third party. They can play the two off against each other and ultimately try to present one as right or wrong.<p>Going back to the specific quote:<p><i>It seems to me that if one were to pick a population to corrupt, one would pick the intellectually lazy majority</i><p>As I read it DaniFong is saying that the general populace is being corrupted by denialists (agreed, as it happens). He uses this as a(n abstract) proof that non-denialist climate change science is accurate and scientists are not corrupted by political motives etc.<p>My argument is that firstly this is a tautology (because both could be true) and actually that both <i>are true</i>.<p>We've seen some politically motivated science hit the news even over the last month or so. Just as much it is clear that the denialists are trying to sway populists to their opinion through a combination of pseudo-science and (more often) by undermining the science (as you mention). Arguing that only one exists doesn't really work any more.<p>I think that if you want to hold an opinion on this you, sadly, have to go and do some realistic research of your own into the topics. It's no longer safe to trust politicians, activists (both for/against) or news agencies (and, yes, some scientists).<p>As an aside: this whole debate amuses me because as I observe it seems incredibly black/white for everyone involved. People are getting so hung up on whether we have an effect on climate or GW that it completely disconnects from the actual main issues. It seems often like there is a minority of people actually trying to do something sensible while the rest bicker of (albeit very important) meta-issues.<p>(btw I'm not a denialist :))",1267368090

If you suffer from ""pressure"" that could be a moderate form of anxiety. A great combat to the parasympathetic response? Breathing.<p>Watch what happens when you get punched in the gut. Your immediate, initially uncontrollable desire is to blindly fight like hell or turn and run. Keeping a calm head takes practice to overcome the rush of hormones. Breathing slows the heart and tempers the response.

1156922,comment,1156838,1156872,0,0,ghfdrvtsyup,,,"I agree. The idea that a martial art can help with programming is a bit of a carryover from when they were considered 'mystical' or 'dangerous' in the mid-late 1970s/early 1980s. Having studied a few and wrestled in HS, I would agree that the real benefit they have is taking your mind off of work, getting exercise, and beating people up/getting beat up. It's <i>fun</i> , and that's what exercise should be.<p>So, do what you want and work hard at it.

Even if the DRM was perfect, would sales have gone up? In all that time people were waiting for a successful crack, how many people gave up on pirating and bought the game? I'm betting the numbers were ludicrously small.<p>The developers would have been better off not spending any money whatsoever developing this copy protection.

1156907,comment,1156356,1156754,0,0,cgranade,,,"Actually, science is characterized largely by an absence of black and white thinking. Speaking as a theoretical physicist, I can assure you that those of us in science will argue ad naseum about whatever detail of a theory you want. It is this precise mechanism that allows us to produce theories which are incredibly well-tested.<p>Where science tends not to see shades of gray is in defending its work from politically-motivated attacks. One might as well accuse biologists of being ""black/white"" on evolution when defending against entirely insubstantial attacks from creationists. Creationists aren't interested, say, in whether it's genes or species that are evolving, but only in whether they can sow enough distrust of science to get into the public discourse. Similarly, climate denialists don't really care about specific problems with climate models as much as they do with undermining how science is perceived.<p>Thus, denialists don't see the actual teeming debate within science over the specifics over how AGW takes form, where real climate skeptics point out problems that are then addressed by the rest of the community. To a denialist, it probably seems as if the world is simply screaming ""no"" at them over and over again, but that doesn't mean there's not a rich world within the science that they denigrate.",1267366552

At most, I think practicing sports helps to keep a healthy body as the counterpart to a healthy mind. In general, I think there are principles of martial arts that can serve as adequate analogies to principles in software engineering (know your tools, be aware of your enemies, use the path of the least resistance, practice makes perfect, it pays to broaden your skills, ...) but knowledge and understanding of those principles is not bound to actually practicing them.",1267366547
1156905,comment,1156361,1156391,0,0,Mz,,,"As a woman who gave away lots of advice/information for free for many years and didn't get much back, I can sympathize with part of her point about ""Pay me"".  I am still trying to figure out how to monetize what I have to offer.  It's clear that I do some things very well that other people usually don't do so well and that there is a ""market"" for what I know.  But, yes, I feel like I've been used and I don't like it.  I feel that way in part because I have had people give me flak for having ads on my websites.  There does seem to be more expectation that women are supposed to just give away their time, energy and knowledge than there is for men. I'm a person with a generous nature but I'm becoming rather burned out and cynical.  So far, being kind-hearted and generous hasn't done anything to solve my financial problems or further my career goals, at least not that I can tell.  I sometimes wish I could grab someone by the collar and go ""What is the goddam SECRET???!!!""  Of course, that wouldn't get me anywhere.<p>In short, I can understand why a woman would post this point of view.  Men frequently complain about having to pay child support in a divorce. In such discussions, both men and women seem to largely overlook the fact that it costs women a great deal more financially than it does men when kids come in to the picture.  Women have lowered salaries, take more time off to care for the kids, lose out on career opportunities, and it is generally assumed that if she has a kid and gets a job, the child-care expenses are part of ""her"" costs of having a job (not ""their"" cost or ""his"" costs).  I think this underlying assumption probably influences a lot of social transactions, from both sides:  Other people assume ""she"" is supposed to give out of goodness and not expect anything in return, and ""she"" assumes she can't ask for anything in return either and/or doesn't know how to do so effectively.  I think women are probably going to continue to struggle with this thorny issue for many years to come.  We definitely don't have gender equality yet.",1267366511

Furthermore, they certainly aren't penalising their suppliers for their poor working conditions!<p>All that will happen is a few underage workers will stop working. The living conditions will still be a joke, workers mistreated, and the dodgy supplier wont suffer in any way (other than needing to find replacements).",1267365764

It's crystal clear that he's not talking about the incidental advances one may obtain from playing video games and that he's not talking about the special niche of 'video games' where the game is an educational instrument. That dismisses your examples and probably your 'on and on'.<p>Meta-comment:
The parent is an example of a critical comment that is upvoted and subsequently hurts the community. It diminishes the chance that people will read and learn from the article. The remark about video games is a relatively minor part of the essay (mostly it was the sbject of the post that inspired this one) and the criticism of only that part probably gives a lot of people the wrong impression about the article. Comments touching only remotely on the article, however insightful, should not be voted to the top. (Please note that this meta-comment does not depend on me disagreeing with (part of) the comment)",1267365637

(And if trading with Iran is illegal how would you buy an Apple or Dell machine anyway?). Can you have gmail/blogger/twitter accounts or are US companies forbidden from giving you free accounts? What languages are popular? Is there a large  internal market for software?<p>Thanks in advance.",1329740173

What one should do is gain intimate knowledge of a particular system/module and keep up to date with it.

Instead of the impression of fewer and fewer bugs in new releases, he started running into them often enough, until the first action he tried in the new release was buggy. That's really not a good state.<p>I'm not sure what would be a useful criticism for a ""I keep running into bugs in your software and it's pissing me off enough to share this with random developers on the internet"" situation. Especially when a bug is a regression and the proper behaviour can be found in the previous version. Apparently submitting the bug is something that the poster is familiar with and which doesn't work that well either. Can you come up with some useful criticism for such situation?",1329740103

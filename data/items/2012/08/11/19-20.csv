4370838,comment,4369512,4369512,5,0,kanamekun,,,"There's a real advantage to buying Twitter followers that isn't highlighted in the article.<p>One of the fastest and easiest ways to grow your follower base is to follow people and hope that they follow you back.  But you can only follow 2k people with a new account before Twitter's anti-(follow)spam algoritms kick in and prevent you from following more.<p>However if you have more than 2k followers, then you are allowed to follow more than 2k accounts.  Twitter actually allows you to follow 10% more people than you have following you... so if you have 10k accounts following you, you can go ahead and follow 11k account.  That means you can followspam 11k accounts instead of just 2k.<p>So by buying fake followers, you greatly increase your ability to follow-spam on Twitter.  And this technique yields (mostly) real followers.  So in short: if it's part of a followspam campaign, buying fake followers is an efficient way to grow your followership much more rapidly.<p>All that said, I'm not a fan of this technique for many reasons.  For starters, it's so unfair to watch other people buy followers and aggressively followspam while you play by the rules.  But so many people do it, so the pressure on everyone to achieve these sorts of results is immense.  It's vaguely reminiscent of baseball in the 90s: everyone else is breaking home run records, so it's easy to be tempted to try steroids.  Also, as a casual user of the site: it's not fun to be followed by so many new accounts that magically have 10k fake followers and are aggressively followspamming to build up real followers.<p>I hope that Twitter cracks down on this unfair practice, and better polices their system against abuse.  In the meantime, just wanted to point out that this abuse is more than just a hack to buy social proof... it's a marketing loophole for Twitter spammers as well.",1344715004

My alma mater has a tale of a student 7 or 8 years ago who built a neural net to detect lizards in photos.  He fed the system a bunch of pictures to teach it what lizards look like.  When it came time to test he got remarkable results: it was 100% effective in positively identifying lizards.  Then he fed it a picture of empty ground and the net happily confirmed that this picture contained a lizard as well!  Turns out, if all of your training data is positive the computer just learns ""everything is a lizard"".<p>Of course, real-life researchers would never dare make such a mistake but this tale always amuses me so I couldn't resist :)",1344714181

4370805,comment,4368993,4369703,1,0,snprbob86,,,"Thanks. I looked at the GVariant page a bunch too.<p>It seems like the encoding is a steam of <i>{type, value}</i> pairs, where values can contain per-type headers as well.<p>Protobufs, on the other hand, use <i>{field, wire-type, value}</i> where <i>field</i> is required to have an externally known type to parse <i>value</i>, but <i>wire-type</i> is sufficient to determine the  length of value, so you can skip unknown fields (used for backwards compatible protocols). In theory, required fields could omit field and wire-type, but Protobufs deemed it more complexity than justifies the space and performance impact.<p>Primitive values like integers are totally expected in any such format like this. Their salient feature being that they're of known length. I'm a little more leery about ""arrays"" or other data structures of variable length which are encoded with a known length. Consider Pascal strings <i>{length, [chars]}</i> vs C strings <i>{[chars], NULL}</i>. The later lends itself much better to streaming protocols, but the former is far simpler to work with when you have a complete dataset.<p>I ran into this situation with a Protobuf I was designing where the first attempt had a message with a repeated field, but it became obvious that I wanted a begin message, a repeated message of singular fields, and then an end message, to allow a fast-start on the send, which didn't require to know the full data set length up front.<p>There are, however, situations where you <i>do</i> want the length up front. For example, if you need to allocate space to put things. You can get faster parsing if you know the total message size immediately. In general, however, I don't think it matters all that much with modern languages and hardware.<p>This is one reason why Clojure has both lists and vectors. Lists are lazy head/tail pairs and (count some-vector) is a constant time operation. Unfortunately, Clojure's reader doesn't seem to offer streaming reads of lists (I may be wrong about this).<p>The bigger issue with unbounded values is that they are more difficult to work with in most languages. Haskell, Lisps, and other functional languages fair far better than most, but once you start mixing fixed-sized messages with known fields, with variable-sized sequences, you wind up with a situation like <i>{x, [ys], z}</i> where a piece of code wants to look at <i>z</i> before looking at <i>ys</i>. If that tuple is represented as an associative structure <i>{:x 1, :ys [2 3], :z 4}</i> then it's suddenly very confusing that it's an ORDERED map and all sorts of assumptions go out the window.<p>Even more fundamentally: Source code is a serialized protocol. You write down text and the order of the characters on the page have meaning. Sometimes, that order may be over-specified, but regardless, humans see order and make assumptions from it, even when order doesn't matter.",1344714065

This community among many others has a tendency to attribute things like this to malice or, more often, conspiracy. I can't tell you how many times I see people thinking along these lines and I just think to myself ""Has anyone ever heard of Occam's Razor?"".<p>An online petition is meaningless to the government if they want to ignore it. We also forget that a petition is more like a very strong request or a demand but no one is obligated fulfill what the petition requests. So even if this petition got a million signatures all it means is that we presumably let whoever is in charge of watching these petitions know that x number of people feel this way.<p>One last major point I want to make is that the government is far more inept than people give it credit for. It's funny how people see the government as either completely incompetent or as some all powerful entity that can exert power over anything and do anything. For example, we have people that believe the USPS is totally broken and the US government is too incompetent to fix it's own postal system. Then, by the same token we have others that believe 9/11 was a massive conspiracy that was masterfully executed. In both cases the problem comes down to the government being run by fallible humans who make mistakes.<p>Very very last thing to think about: to some, the TSA petition was incredibly important and it's being taken down has been, in their minds, morphed into some kind of conspiracy to keep the people down. Now I ask you what about the other petitions on the site? To some people the TSA petition isn't important but some other random petition is. There are lots of petitions that are just as important to people that do make their signature goal.

Now if that optimization has been negated by the enviroment then you can ask yourself the next question.  Does the code need to be or envisaged in the near future to need changing for a reason other than making something that works into something that works and is readable but not as fast.<p>Both question are important and if you answear no to either then your best leaving the change to a time when you have to change it.  Reason being that you may have a margin in the enviroment negating the optimization today, but that may change before you need to change the code for a reason of business.  You could end up beutifying it and losing that optimization and then end up hitting that wall a few months/years down the line and have to reinvent that optimization.<p>Over all the most important aspect about reading code is to understand the structure and by that this part does this and that part does that.  If your calling a optimized load of code in a function then if that code is sexy looking or not it will still have the same look from anything that calls it.<p>So as a rule, if you don't have to touch it and don't need to touch it then ask yourself why your touching it and are you workbombing yourself with something in a less busy period that will drag on over into a busy period and cause you regret it down the line.  Also make sure your doing it for the right reasons, beyond putting a flag ontop of a mountain so to  speak, what are you gaining.

Let's now take a deep breath and read it again. We'll see how this article makes most mundane and unremarkable things sound like a spy triller, it's a nice piece of work:<p><i>Former senior intelligence officials have created a detailed surveillance system more accurate than modern facial recognition technology</i><p>More accurate how? Than which modern facial recognition technology? All of them together? Sounds unlikely that RT made a survey of all modern face recognition technologies. But even if they did - what exactly it allows to do more accurately and how much more accurately? From the descriptions it sounds like it <i>is</i> a facial recognition technology plus some pattern matching - but 99% of it is marketing-speak, so impossible to understand what it actually does.<p><i>Every few seconds, data picked up at surveillance points in major cities and landmarks across the United States are recorded digitally on the spot</i><p>So we have some data recording happening in some locations in the US. We don't know anything about these locations except that some of them are inside major US cities and some other are in known places which aren't cities. For all we know, it may be inside bank vaults in major cities, or inside private secure structures - but the authors certainly make it sound as it is practically in your bedroom. It's like they are in major cities and I am in a major city - OMG!<p>Then these ominous surveillance points record video <i>digitally</i>. Oh noes! Just like my digital camera! Must be made by CIA to spy on me too. And it does it <i>on the spot!</i> There must be some spy stuff going on. But you heard nothing yet:<p><i>then encrypted</i><p>As we all know, encryption is practically synonymous with shady business. Nobody who has nothing to hide uses encryption. They do, ergo they are up to something bad.<p><i>and instantaneously delivered</i><p>Instantaneously! I mean, move over, physics, CIA is here! Oh, you mean they just upload their videos to the central server over https using broadband networks? Just like I do with Youtube clips? So that must mean Youtube is under CIA control too, I guess.<p><i>to a fortified central database center</i><p>Fortified center! Certainly sounds ominous - nobody ever that is up to any good would have any physical security in his data center that stores millions of dollars in hardware and information. Fortified means bad. It's like Mordor, dude!<p><i>at an undisclosed location</i><p>Undisclosed location? Did you ever hear ""undisclosed location"" in context that meant anything good? It's or somebody is hiding from mafia hitmen, or some spooks are meeting to discuss their spooky things. Or it's a conspiracy-speak for ""they didn't tell us where their data center is because they didn't think it's our business to know where their data center is"".<p><i>to be aggregated with other intelligence</i><p>OMG, can it get <i>any</i> worse? Other intelligence! What kind of other intelligence? Who cares, it's obvious aggregating video with ""other intelligence"" can only make it worse. Other intelligence is spookier than anything else, just let your imagination run for a bit and you'd see how scary ""other intelligence"" can get.<p>It's like that face.com startup that Facebook bought - that allowed to combine facial recognition with ""other intelligence"" to sort facebook pictures or make logins via face recognition APIs. I didn't know those guys were CIA, I actually used them! Good thing facebook shut them down. Or maybe they just were not supposed to show this technology to the people? After all, Facebook is CIA too, so maybe they just went <i>underground</i>...<p><i>The employee roster at Arbaxas reads like a whos who of agents once with the Pentagon, CIA and other government entities according to their public LinkedIn profiles, and the corporation's ties are assumed to go deeper than even documented.</i><p>And now's this. Some employees of these companies worked for CIA or DoD (we don't know in which capacity, but everybody that ever worked for DoD in any capacity is up to no good, it's clear) or ""other government entities"" - you know, Department of Education, EPA, NIH, Smithsonian, National Science Foundation - those all are ""government entities"", so we can cover a lot of ground here while sounding like we still talk about spies. And if we miss something, we can always say ""it is assumed"" - by which we mean we just assumed that because why not, but we will say it as if it is a known, even if undocumented, fact.<p>So what we have is a regular video surveillance system with some algorithms built on top, some company founded by people with govt connections, looking probably into some juicy govt contracts on securing some of the numerous govt facilities that need securing, and some creative writers making it all sound like the CIA is out to get us while giving us next to zero information on actually <i>what</i> we are supposed to be afraid of and what new is in what they tell us.",1344713351

When some one proposes a technical approach he doesn't like, he can simply call him a ""conservative-not that there is anything wrong with that"".<p>Yegge is an average programmer at best. He wasn't able to maintain a simple 2D game and very easily blamed Java for it. It was a clear case of PEBKAC. It is absurd and unsurprising at the same time, that the simple act of blogging can some how elevate a programmer to expert status.<p>Yegge clearly has no idea what he is talking about. I am currently working with Scala which is apparently Hardcore conservative. Look at his characteristics of liberal languages.<p>1. Eval. - scala has a REPL, so u can do an eval if you wish.<p>2. Metaprogramming - scala macros<p>3. Dynamic scoping - No<p>4. all-errors-are-warnings - Meaningless bullet point, all languages encounter statements that it cannot meaningfully interpret. This statement just shows you Yegge's massive PL understanding deficit.<p>5. Reflection and dynamic invocation. RTTI - Scala has these.<p>6. The C preprocessor - Nope<p>7. Lisp macros - scala macros.<p>8. Domain-specific languages (for the most part). Optional parameters. Extensible syntax. Downcasting.  Auto-casting.  reinterpret_cast. Automatic stringification.  Automatic type conversions across dissimilar types.  \n- all yes for scala. Infact, you can provide your own casts for any 2 types and import/export casts as you wish.<p>9. Nil/null as an overloaded semantic value (empty list, empty string, value-not-present) - Yes and No, Option[T] is generic. If you want to know if any container(including strings) is empty, you say container.isEmpty(). But not container == null.<p>10. Debuggers. Yes Scala has debuggers. At this point one has to ask - what is this guy smoking. If your language has a debugger it is a liberal language? WTF??<p>11. Bit fields - No<p>12. Implicit conversion operators (e.g. Scala's implicits).  Sixty-pass compilers.  Whole-namespace imports.  Thread-local variables.  Value dispatch.  Arity-based function overloading.  Mixed-type collections.\nYes,  yes, yes for scala.<p>13. API compatibility modes.  Advice and AOP.  Convention in preference to explicit configuration.\nThese are fairly vague properties and you could say yes/no.<p>I recently converted a ""liberal"" perl project into ""conservative"" scala and the code size fell by an order of magnitude, but apparently I live in alternate universe where ""conservative"" languages are somehow more succinct.<p>This guy is just suffering from verbal diarrhoea and he gets way too much attention for his uninformed commentary. I haven't seen a more bogus classification in ages, it is quite amazing how he politicized a purely technical topic.<p>It is fairly clear what his issue is<p>1. He likes dynamically typed languages. You have to type less and lower error checking is tolerated by the community.<p>2. He is uncomfortable with more advanced PL concepts, cannot decipher compiler error messages when working languages like Haskell. He would much rather let the program run and crash with a run time stack, where he can jump in and examine the value or operation that caused the failure. The Haskell compiler error message makes him feel stupid and he does not like it. This also probably explains why he wants to dump clojure into conservative territory, too much of STM and Parallel Haskellish stuff going on.<p>3. He is not a big fan of java/C++.<p>There is nothing peculiar about the set of biases he has, in fact it is fairly typical. People who favor Java/C++ simply need high performance code that would need to be maintained/refactored for a long time. It is not a religious choice but a pragmatic decision in the face of constraints. I have never seen ""conservatives"" write build scripts in C++ or ""liberals"" write OS kernels in Ruby.<p>All the attributes he has described simply cannot produce the ordering of languages that he has conjured. In the only barely technical portion of the post he has contradicted himself soundly, but it doesn't matter because no one is paying any attention to that.",1344712001

His idea is interesting only insofar as it manages to so successfully get and keep people's attention.

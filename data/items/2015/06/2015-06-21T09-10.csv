If people are given enough independence and individual responsibilities, but in a collaborative setting, it will become obvious to the entire team when individuals are not carrying their weight.<p>Keep in mind that once a person becomes a member of your team you&#x27;re in it for the long haul.  Every once in a while a team needs to rally to achieve objectives, since it&#x27;s almost impossible to give perfectly equal distribution of work in a project.  Every once in a while individuals need to be propped up by the rest of the team if they&#x27;re having difficulties with their individual responsibilities.<p>It should only become a problem when the same individuals, over the course of an extended period of time, fail to meet their objectives.  And even then if the company is large enough they should be given an opportunity to move laterally within the company to move to another team.  If individuals fail regularly within multiple teams at that point it becomes obvious they may need to be let go.<p>With all that said, different projects / companies have different budgets and so they may need to cut corners.  That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important to be careful to select people you are in it for the long haul with, and are willing to put the time and energy into that person as an investment for the betterment of the company.<p>Sudden turnover is one of the worst things for morale in any company.

9752793,comment,9750930,9752453,0,0,jenius,,,"Just jumping in here to back you up jpmoral. In fact, I said in my original comment that I am not trying to tell anyone how to spend money and its these peoples&#x27; own lives and they can do what they want, right in the last paragraph. So I hope nobody was offended here.<p>On the other hand, the first reply above actually answers the question. Notice that, while cloaked as a rebuttal to my initial comment, it was actually a string of defenses as to how the author rationalizes spending money for himself, others, or both, which was precisely what I asked for. Let&#x27;s take a look at the points made:<p>- I earned this money so I can spend it how I want<p>- I should not hold back on spending money because it&#x27;s my personal freedom<p>- Do you give away 100% of your money? If not, you are no better than me so who are you to suggest this?<p>- We have tried to solve worldwide poverty problems and failed many times, so it won&#x27;t make a difference if I donate<p>- The money I spend on luxurious things is helping society as it creates jobs and trickles down the supply chain, so anything I spend is actually good for the world<p>- It&#x27;s none of your business how I spend my money<p>Pretty decent answer actually, when it comes down to it. The answer is simply that people come up with a relatively consistent number of ways that they can rationalize themselves spending excessively, and from these rationalizations build their psychological defense. In fact, many of the points in his answer are <i>exactly the same</i> as the ones from the quora threads linked in my edit above.<p>Now, my next question is whether any of these defenses are valid. My preliminary research indicates that a resounding &quot;no&quot; is the answer, however, I&#x27;m going to continue researching and do a separate writeup on this topic, as it&#x27;s fairly extensive. If anyone from here is interested at all let me know on twitter or something (@jescalan) and I&#x27;ll link you when it&#x27;s done.

9752774,comment,9751758,9752739,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"> For example, suppose you want to test a scheduler, or any mechanism that places a timeout on an operation. You could abstract away the entire timing mechanism, but that is exactly what you&#x27;re trying to test: maybe the developer used some system function wrong, and is now waiting 5 seconds instead of 5 milliseconds?<p>Time is an IO effect, so it&#x27;s true that mocking it away removes that test. I&#x27;d treat that kind of &quot;do I understand the API?&quot; issue as an integration test, and split the problem up a little:<p>- &quot;Mock&quot; the timeout calls, to allow as many tests as possible to run outside IO<p>- Write tests where the operation always succeeds (eg. &quot;Just x&quot;)<p>- Write tests where the operation always times out (eg. &quot;Nothing&quot;)<p>- Write tests which do a combination of success/timeout and a bunch of different interleavings (QuickCheck would probably be useful here)<p>- Write some small integration tests, eg. give a timeout of &quot;5&quot; to a process that sleeps for 5 seconds, it should time out; give a timeout of &quot;5&quot; to a process that sleeps for 4 seconds, it should succeed; and so on.<p>> Mocking (or IO isolating as you call it in Haskell) ends up producing really good unit-tests, but often the more important tests span more than one small unit, and making those non-flaky is very hard.<p>Haskell&#x27;s IO isolation causes the vast majority of a program to be defined outside IO.

9752739,comment,9751758,9752222,0,0,pron,,,"> Haskell&#x27;s ability to define restricted subsets of generalize IO is extremely powerful and sidesteps this entire problem.<p>Except it doesn&#x27;t, precisely where that problem is most annoying. For example, suppose you want to test a scheduler, or any mechanism that places a timeout on an operation. You could abstract away the entire timing mechanism, but that is exactly what you&#x27;re trying to test: maybe the developer used some system function wrong, and is now waiting 5 seconds instead of 5 milliseconds?<p>This approach (which is the same as the mocking approach -- there&#x27;s nothing special about Haskell here) doesn&#x27;t do too well when you want to test timing, and those tests are usually the most brittle (hosted continuous integration services often introduce really long pauses). Of course, you could weave virtual time services throughout your code, but then you have the third-party library problem again.<p>Mocking (or IO isolating as you call it in Haskell) ends up producing really good unit-tests, but often the more important tests span more than one small unit, and making those non-flaky is very hard.<p>In theory, you could replace all references to time in a JVM language -- even in libraries -- using an agent or a bootstrap classloader in order to make larger tests run predictably, but I&#x27;m not aware of people going to such great lengths (maybe Google does it; I know, for example, that when it comes to accessing the filesystem, they replace the JVM&#x27;s filesystem provider with an in-memory file-system[1] when they don&#x27;t mock, but I don&#x27;t know how the deal with clocks).<p>EDIT: Apparently somebody has done just that as a research project[2].

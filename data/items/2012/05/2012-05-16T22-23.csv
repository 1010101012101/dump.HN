The upload is slow; my files are large and the uplink is slow, so it's my fault, but there could be better handling of this problem I think.<p>3. Further, there is no way to send feedback. When I click ""feedback"" I am presented with a search box for FAQ. I don't think it's time yet to be afraid of too many people sending in suggestions and feedback.

3984503,comment,3984004,3984004,4,0,reneherse,,,"What, I rejoin last night and there's already an article about it? ;)<p>Seriously though, in my search for cheap/free movies what pushed me off the fence about rejoining Netflix was that they were offering the first month free, even though I'm not a new customer. All the details of my account were saved, and all I had to do what update the security code and expiration date on my card. Pretty damn good UX through the re-signup process.<p>The annoyance factor came when I tried to watch a movie. I got an error message with an obscure DRM error code, and instructions to call a Netflix 800 number. Rather than wake Reed Hastings up at an ungodly hour, I Googled around and followed advice to delete a particular Silverlight related file, and restart the browser.<p>Again, no dice, but at least now the error code was one that prompted me to upgrade my version of Silverlight. Downloaded, installed, restart browser. Log back in for the third or fourth time. NOW I can watch my movie.<p>Let's just say that was only mildly annoyed by all of this because the first month was free. And the process in the end was somewhat less painful than hunting for a working stream (...or what that must be like, I'm sure). ;)<p>One free month is more than enough time to re-evaluate whether their streaming catalog is worth the 7.99 monthly price. I do hope they've added more A-list movies on the streaming side, because it's just not worth it for me to tack on another eight bucks to get access to the DVD catalog.",1337209041

Unless you're arguing that higher taxes won't increase government income (which is a totally specious argument that people make all the time, but which isn't backed up in the least by any actual historical analyses), then higher taxes absolutely could solve the deficit problem.  Federal tax revenues as a share of overall GDP are historically low right now, and merely letting the Bush tax cuts expire for good would solve almost all of the ""deficit crisis.""  For example see <a href=""http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/26/are-the-bush-tax-cuts-the-root-of-our-fiscal-problem/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/26/are-the-bush-ta...</a> or <a href=""http://baselinescenario.com/2011/10/03/how-big-is-the-long-term-debt-problem/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://baselinescenario.com/2011/10/03/how-big-is-the-long-t...</a><p>So I guess it depends on what problem you want to solve, but if you're worried about the federal deficit, then higher taxes (even in the form of just eliminating the bush tax cuts) will absolutely help to solve that problem.",1337209021

3984423,comment,3983953,3983953,4,0,tytso,,,"Open source used to be used as a marketing tool --- people believed that software was automatically better if it was Open Source.   Today, people have learned how to be more nuanced; just because it is better in some FSF sense (if it is ""free software"" in the Stallman/GPL ethical/moral sense of the word) doesn't mean it's better for a particular business purpose.  If you're a developer, or your company has a development shop where it's prepared to make changes, then obviously Open Source is better.<p>If however, you're prepared to contract out support and development to a company like Red Hat, then from your perspective as a customer, it may not matter as much.  As long as you are willing to pay $$$ to Red Hat and the software/services/support is of sufficient quality for your purposes, you're happy.  Now replace ""Red Hat"" with ""Oracle"" in the above statement; does it still work?  Why, yes.  So you really won't care if it's Open Source or not.<p>At one point there was an argument that Open Source is good because you're free to change to a different vendor.  i.e., if you don't like Red Hat's services, you could always switch to SuSE.  In practice, alas, the ways in which various boot and configuration scripts are set up are just a tiny bit different enough that it's often not trivial to switch from one Linux provider to another.  So the main difference is whether or not you're willing to make changes to the source code and recompile.  But if you're a Red Hat customer, the moment you do that you use lose support for your modified package.  So most Red Hat customers probably don't take advantage of the fact that all Red Hat software is ""open source"", at least not in a direct way.  And in that case, why bother trying to use it as a marketing term?",1337207930

Namely, notice that according to this data, the median AGI of the United States is $32,396/year.<p>So <i>half the population</i> is making less than $32k/year.  Yes, the top 10% and the top half of the population are taking on almost all of the income-tax burden.... because they (we, in my case) have almost all the income.<p>There's nothing fair about demanding tax money from people who are just plain poor.  You tax the rich, because rich people have money.<p>Now, we could talk about distributing the tax burden ""fairly"" across the rich and the middle class, <i>but that assumes we have large, broad middle class</i>.  Which we <i>don't</i>: making a ""middle-class salary"" like, say, $66,193/year <i>already</i> puts you on the border of the top 25% of the country.<p>And then notice that to get from the top 25% to the top 10%, you have to make <i>almost</i> twice as much money.  Top 10% to top 5% isn't that large of an increase, but top 5% to top 1% requires <i>more than doubling</i> your income.<p>So, to be clear:<p>To go from median to top 25%, you need to roughly double your income.  To go from 75th percentile to 90th percentile, you need to almost double your income.  To go from 95th percentile to 99th percentile, you need to more-than-double your income.  <i>We're operating a tax system designed for a bell-curve income distribution when what we actually have is a power-law income distribution.</i>",1337206128

I don't believe Ruby is taking over the world. Six years ago it was, but now it's fairly mature and stable. I do believe that Ruby is better-loved overall than Java. (Incidentally, you'll notice Java is dropping two orders of magnitude faster than Ruby on TIOBE's chart.)<p>2. I have been programming Objective-C since 2001 when OS X came out. I'm pretty familiar with it.<p>3. HN is not ""the horizon of the entire programming world,"" but it is pretty well-embedded in the Silicon Valley startup scene, which is what I was discussing at the time. My point is this: Take a look at any area where passionate coders get to choose any technology stack they want and you will find Ruby is generally more popular than Java. If HN's job listing isn't convincing to you, let's take a look at another place where coders choose their own language  open source. On Github's ranking of most popular languages, Ruby is #2 and Java is #5.<p>4. I am not trying to convince you that you should love or hate any languages. I am saying that many people do, and their feelings towards these languages affect how they behave.<p>As a side note, I agree that programming languages are tools, but honestly, most artists and craftsmen I know do have favorite tools  a favorite violin, a favorite kind of film, etc. Heck, many people have a favorite chair.

Personally, I spend all my advertising dollars/effort (and good brand building requires far more effort than dollars.)  on brand building, and as little as possible on per-customer sales (except as it relates to the 'brand building' - support is part of that.)<p>I mean, it's like commission.   For co-location, it's traditional to give the referring party 10% of what the customer pays you for the life of their contract.  (sometimes it's for the life of the customer, and through any upgrades, too.)   -  every customer pays a different price for the same product, and you are expected to spend hours selling to the customer.<p>My approach is to put the price and information on the website, and then advertise that.  Spend little effort on each individual sale.<p>The advantage of per-customer effort is that you can specially craft your offering to charge as much as that particular customer can pay.<p>The disadvantage, of course, is that is a lot of work, and it doesn't help your reputation any.  This is a big reason why IAAS is crushing co-location; It literally takes months to get the real price out of a co-location provider, while amazon has the prices right there on the website. (I mean, the off the bat price is about twice as high as the ""real price"" after negotiating and looking around in co-location.    Cogent quoted me $3/Mbps six months ago.  I signed papers at $0.65/Mbps.  There isn't as much room when it comes to power?  but my highest quote is easily twice the price of the lowest quote.)<p>I don't know about you, but as a customer?  I will pay more to know the price up front (and to be reasonably sure that I will pay a similar price if I need more later)  -  I mean, I won't pay 400% more, but I would pay 30% more,  that negotiation isn't free on either side.<p>So yeah, I think brand building is the better advertising value in the long term.    It is more effort, though;  writing articles probably has a better return than buying ads for brand building.  (buying ads has a place, too.)",1337205610

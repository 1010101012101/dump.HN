It's obvious that hacking would be far worse without security researchers finding and disclosing bugs that can be fixed.<p>What Linus is describing seems to be more along the lines of 'public approval'. When a big new hack is found, the researcher who finds the hack is treated like a rock star and given a ton of praise, and the company/coder responsible for the security bug gets a lot of dirt thrown their way. ""How can you be so stupid as to let customer's data be taken?!"" - that kind of thing. As Linus says, these bugs are generally very complex things and people obviously make mistakes.<p>Might be better for the community in general to try and not treat security researchers/hackers with so much awe? Moot point at any rate, it's just human nature - not going to be able to change that. People will always jump on this kind of thing (strikers in soccer get far more awe than defenders, even though both are equally valuable to the team).",1353862763

The questioner asks:<p><i>How can this paradigm be used to build predictable software that works as intended when we have no guarantee when and where an expression will be evaluated?</i><p>While it is true that this will not lead to unexpected computations in a pure language, it may lead to excessive memory use. For instance, consider the definition of Data.Map.Lazy.Map:<p><a href=""http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/containers/src/Data-Map-Base.html#Map"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/contai...</a><p>The Map data type is spine-strict and key strict in Weak Head Normal Form (WHNF). However, it is not strict in its values, and values may be thunks (unevaluated expressions). This may result the memory usage of the values to be much larger than when they are fully evaluated.<p>There is now also a variant of Data.Map that is value-strict, but only in WHNF, so only the outermost constructors may have been evaluated, and you'd have to evaluate the data further to have thunks replaced by actual values.<p>Thunk leaks are something that every new Haskell programmer will bump into and is something that makes programs less predictable if you are not yet comfortably reason about strictness and laziness.<p>Edward Yang wrote a nice explanation of such leaks:<p><a href=""http://blog.ezyang.com/2011/05/anatomy-of-a-thunk-leak/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.ezyang.com/2011/05/anatomy-of-a-thunk-leak/</a><p>I very much enjoy Haskell, but I think that the benefits of laziness are much overstated.

Reddit has the problem quite frequently, people will submit referral links under the guise of the content being ""interesting"" or having some value to users and then it becomes a game of ""is this person genuine or are they looking to make money?"". Ultimately it doesn't really matter that much and you're a long standing HN user (didn't notice it was you who submitted this...) so deleting it would probably be overkill, just might make a few people apprehensive about being gamed.<p>People share their blog entries and companies and products here all the time to make money and that's fine but I figure that's because it's transparent whereas referral links (where the person intentionally used it) are trying to make money without admitting it. ""I made this product..."" vs. ""This product looks amazing, what do you think?"" the latter is misleading when (intentional) referral links are involved, because I don't assume by default the person presenting it is in it for the money.",1353860018

This doesn't look like the site of a failing project: <a href=""https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/</a><p>It's not that the project is about to fail, it's that even with that I still don't see a future. The project is mostly driven by the now-disinterested Google and a bunch of large companies with huge and different GWT-based frameworks (SmartGWT, Vaadin, Sencha GXT). The latter players only have an interest in keeping the core of GWT alive, not in advancing the regular GWT experience. Other players are small and on the whole don't seem to be contributing in promising ways (in my opinion). For example, the GWT-P framework, despite some good ideas, is quite verbose and provides false time savings.<p>>> I can change things in the client or server code, save and see the results instantly.<p>I work on a medium-sized code base (compared to some enterprise code I used to work on in the past). I am using 1-yr-old top-of-the-line MBP with best-available SSD and let's just say we disagree on the definition of the term instantly. I experience anywhere from 15 to 30 second waits on refreshes (that trigger recompilation), plus server restarts if server-side hot code deploy fails. That's far from instant.<p>>>>> it's inexcusable for a 2012-era framework to not have a quality form validation library available.<p>>> <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/gwt-validation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/gwt-validation/</a><p>I disagree. Have you actually used that library? All it does is data validation. That's not my problem.<p>My problem is tying that into forms and the UI. Compare that to <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation</a>, compare that to validation provided in SmartGWT's forms.<p>Have you written forms that had to be validated? GWT CellTables that had to have contents be validated?<p>There is another GWT validation library out there that helps with forms/tying into GWT controls, but it's quite lackluster.<p>>>>> The other downside of GWT is that it's written in verbose Java<p>>> That is a huge, major win dude. Seriously. What else would we all program the web in? JavaScript?<p>Java is verbose and you have to recognize that downside. I will often pay those costs of verbosity on the server-side in exchange for performance. Someone else here gave a good alternative perspective, but yeah, JavaScript.<p>>>>> ...Java, with plenty of non-DRY stuff.<p>>> DRY is a principle, you can repeat yourself or not in any language you choose.<p>The problem with GWT, and this applies to the non-DRY comment, is that they did not aggressively go after eliminating that. They just said, ""it's Java, things are just going to have to be verbose."" C'mon, you wrote a Java-to-Javascript compiler for Pete's sake, surely you can put some talent into making the core development experience better! Especially in the face of competition like jQuery or Rails.<p>Creating two files per page/view sucks (or 3 files with GWT-P, be warned), or coding up your views w/o UI binder, you end up coding the layout of the page in pure Java (verbose and far from directly relatable to the layout). I already mentioned the pain of doing GWT RPC calls in my previous comment. I could go on all day.<p>Of course, DRY is a principle. Use it!",1353859586

I'm committed to join others that make their material available for free (under a creative commons license) and encourage colleagues from other institutions to do the same.  The good news is that I soon will have completed a textbook for introductory linear algebra.  The not-so-good news (for most of the HN crowd) is that all I write is in French.  Fortunately, there are already free textbooks in linear algebra available in English.  If enough of us make a stand, within 5 years there might be enough material written to shame anyone showing this kind of disgusting behaviour.",1345417095

The book didn't seem to have very many used copies being sold as it was an advanced class and people were more likely to keep the book than sell it.<p>Just providing context to how a custom edition can be cheaper if the professor does work.<p>I've also had many professors write their own book and give it for free in pdf or let you buy it for $20 at the university copy center already bound with the option of buying supplemental books that they thought were of good quality.<p>Maybe my engineering department was different but it seemed most of my professors tried to work to help the students not have to pay large amounts.",1345417088

I'm not really talking about this specific example, but a myriad of other examples where using transitions and other CSS features do make sense.<p>My favorite example is the way transitions handle height/width properties set it auto, in that they just don't. If you do decide to change the height of an ""auto"" sized item and want a transition you instead have to set it's current height explicitly (in Javascript) first, then set it to the height of the to the height of the new content (having calculated that somehow.

If you're a consumer, sure, StubHub and CL will probably do the best for you, but that's because you're not a broker.<p>I'll definitely make some brokers angry by explaining this, but there are a few ticketing networks, the largest being TicketNetwork (TN).<p>TN is a SaaS play that costs somewhere in the $2500/year range, and goes up or down depending on which services you need. If I'm a broker I can simply get on TicketNetwork and list my tickets. We'll say I bought a ticket for $50 and I want to sell it for $100. I put it on the network at $100. TicketNetwork automatically updates it so that it's selling on your site for $100. Since it's on the network every other ticket broker has access to it, and they resell it for different amounts (standard is your price + 20%). So another ticket broker in my city would try to sell the ticket for $120 - they pay me $100, and I dropship it directly to the customer with a white-label packing slip.<p>There are about 800 brokers on the network at any given time and about $1 Billion in inventory. Some won't sell, most will. The affiliate payout in the ticket industry is among the highest, since it's super high margins. As a broker it's great, because as soon as you throw a ticket on the network you have 800 people trying to sell your ticket. But not just anyone can be on the Network - you have to pay a pretty penny for that opportunity, that keeps people like you out.<p>Where TicketsNow makes most of its money is in the selling. They have excellent marketing, great affiliates, and they are selling an absurd amount of tickets. They let you post your tickets on TicketsNow, but that's not where the real money is made, the real money is in selling other brokers' tickets that are much higher margins.",1345415947

This is a great idea for patron happiness. Unfortunately the patron isn't the customer at a ticketing agent. The customer is the presenter/promoter or venue. As a patron, I don't NOT buy Japandroids tickets because TicketMaster is the ticketing agent. This plan causes the ticketing agency to almost assuredly lose money or customers (price too low they lose money, price too high they lose smaller venues).<p>b) The ""big guys"" are also probably that artist's promoter, or they own the venue. LN/TM promote most big names and own a good portion of the venues. It's vertical.<p>c) No band wants their promoter or agent to deal with merch. Merch is where a lot of the money comes in at the venue, and they want as much control of that as possible. Most venues already require a certain percentage of merch sales be given back in settlement. The only way to make this work would be for the label or artist to sell the merch package ahead of time with a voucher for tickets to be used at the agent.<p>It doesn't help that ticketing a very large likely to sell out show is HARD. It doesn't help that convenience charges are accepted in the industry and quite frankly, if you're a venue that runs a hard box office with an online agent, you love that they charge a convenience fee.<p>The only real solution without major disruption by a major act leaving the LN/TM world is for TM to show final price, and have all the settlement be secret. I honestly would prefer to see the fees as they break down, so I know how much is going to the box office settlement.",1345415578

Credit card rules until recently have forbidden merchants from passing those costs on selectivey to credit card users, so the net result is essentially that credit cards users are subsidized by non-users, which provides a strong incentive for people to use credit cards, which maintains the monopoly.

In response to to the proposed solutions:<p><i>""Someone Needs To Create A New Ticketing Platform""</i><p>Creating it is one thing.  Getting venues to agree to use it is much, much harder.  Venues usually sign long-term (5-10 year) contracts with Ticketmaster to make them their exclusive ticket platform.  These contracts usually include a large upfront payment from Ticktmaster to the venue.  Given that LiveNation is the by far the biggest promoter in the US, it would be an enormous risk for a venue to forsake Ticketmaster and go with an alternative.<p><i>""Venues/Artists Need To Ditch The Big Guys""</i><p>See the above.  Pearl Jam rather famously tried this in the mid-1990's, with disastrous results (<a href=""http://goo.gl/xJItB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/xJItB</a>).  Not playing in Ticketmaster venues forced them into the netherlands of American live music venues.<p><i>""All-Inclusive Pricing Model""</i><p>To Ticketmaster's credit, they're getting a lot better at this, but they still have a way to go.  It's worth noting that the majority of the fees that the author complains about are not kept by Ticketmaster; they are kicked back to the event promoter.  The promoter does this so that they can advertise low face values (appearing fan-friendly) while maintaining margins.<p><i>""Offer More Music/Merchandise + Ticket Packages""</i><p>This is a bit of a non-sequitur.  The author writes the entire article from the perspective of making ticket buying better, and then throws this in ""for the content creators.""  It will indeed make more money for artists, assuming it doesn't hurt conversion rate (which it does) but strong-arming consumers into buying more stuff when they purchase tickets doesn't seem fan-friendly to me.<p><i>""Forget Everything I Just Wrote, We Should All Learn From Louis C.K.""</i><p>Totally impractical.  Louis C.K. could pull this off because he performs at comedy clubs.  If you're Coldplay...not an option (see above).<p>There's no question that ticketing needs reformation.

I want to ignore 3 and 4 movies, so it doesn't matter if the algorithm can predict them well. It also doesn't matter <i>alot</i> if it is able to ferret out every possible 5; as long as it gets a substantial portion, everything is great.<p>I played a bit with this contest when it first started, along with a friend. In just one night, I was able to beat Netflix's own algorithm by enough to get us onto the leaderboard (temporarily). And the algorithm I used was nothing fancy, just correct scaling and normalizing using means and standard deviations: high school math. Unfortunately, neither of us knew anything about algorithms for collaborative filtering, so we quickly reached a plateau.",1242953804

Most high schools, even fairly good ones, are going to have a dearth of technical knowledge present in the administrative staff, so lightweight is good.  They need software that is as easy to set up as possible, and they need be assured that it's reliable--schoolteachers and administrators are deathly afraid of parents and lawsuits, and something that loses grades is anathema.<p>(And I second what mahmud said above; the accomplishments in your profile make my head spin)",1242953314

621362,comment,621198,621335,0,0,zimbabwe,,,"The Mac in 84 onwards was run by a man who thought Apple had to sacrifice its design integrity to succeed. Since then it has been placed back in Jobs' hands, and he's taken a decade to fill it with people who believe in his design philosophy. Note that the iPod has maintained its virtual monopoly thanks to design alone. So far, no competitor has arisen to match the iPhone. I'd love it if one appeared, but it hasn't happened so far.<p>You seem to think that design progress is a given. Look at Microsoft for the counterexample. They have progressed their design several major times since Windows 95, and each one has taken steps back. The fact that window borders are now twice as huge as they were a decade ago, or that gradients have been added where gradients are not needed, makes me think that the people designing Windows simply don't know what about Apple's design appeals to people.<p>Phone design seems similarly hedged. I play with every major phone that comes out, because I want somebody to get Apple scared enough to turn more competitive. So far, nothing done. I don't know why companies feel the need to place meaningless gradients for backgrounds, or shade things in pretty ways that reduce functionality, but they all do, and they seem to think it's helping. Apple's not perfect here - there's a lot about their designs that I dislike, especially regarding their iPod classic - but they at least understand what they're supposed to be doing.<p><i>Most estimates are that about 95% percent of downloads are free so that would make about 50M apps sold.</i><p>Apologies for saying ""sold"".

This is the part that forms the core of Blackboard's software offering.<p>One of my professors at Cornell told us a bit about how CourseInfo came about; if I remember correctly, it started as work one student was doing for a particular professor to keep said professor's class website organized, and it grew from there.  At some point, Cornell's administrators deliberately chose not to employ the student who was building what was evolving into CourseInfo in order for him to legally keep all the rights to his creation.

You imply that there is no different between preference & what we see as morals.<p>I don't think you're free and clear though. There are all sorts of ways to draw a distinction between the two. From a utilitarian perspective, you could argue that torturing causes pain & is therefore bad. From a rights/liberty perspective, you could argue that it violates some ones rights or liberties. Form the Kantian/Deontological or many other perspectives, you'd see that you would not want torture to be widespread or that it is inherently wrong.<p>Basically, almost to the extent that morality can be said to exist, torture can be said to be wrong. Peanut butter eating can be said to be right.

I see this a playing out much like the Mac from 84 onwards with regards to the UI.<p>> ...which has sold a billion applications in less than a year<p>Actually this is downloads not sales. Most estimates are that about 95% percent of downloads are free so that would make about 50M apps sold. Readers may want to consider why they are upvoting a story that contains false information and downvoting the story that corrects it. They may want to ask themselves 'just what has happened to my critical faculties with regards to the iphone'. Or not.<p>Of course other platforms that actually allow you to install software without the approval of their 'app store' can't trumpet numbers like these cause they don't know about every single app their users are installing.

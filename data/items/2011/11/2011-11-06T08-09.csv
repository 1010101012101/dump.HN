Once sugar became cheap enough, maple syrup began to be used only when one <i>wanted</i> the maple flavor, but by then the grading was well-established.",1320569910

But, many of the author's points can be refuted by using version 2.0.<p>Regarding the point of using getLastError(), the author is completely correct. But the problem is not so much that MongoDB isn't good, it's that developers start using it and expect it to behave like a relational DB. Start thinking in an asynchronous programming paradigm, and you'll have less problems.<p>I got bit my MongoDB early on. When my server crashed, I learned real quickly what fsync, journaling, and friends can do. The best thing a dev can do before using MongoDB is to RTFM and understand its implications.<p>The #1 reason that I used MongoDB, was because of the schema-less models. That's it.

As such, what was valued was a neutral flavor, i.e., something that tasted as little like maple as possible, and as much like sweet liquid.  Thus, Grade A (and Grade A Fancy, etc.) went to the lightest, mildest syrup, and Grade B (and Grade C, which is for industrial use) went to the darker syrup with a stronger maple flavor.<p>(As an aside: the grading is done by color.  There is a small kit producers buy which has small samples of colored liquid for each grade, and the grade is assigned based on which liquid your syrup's color matches most closely.)<p>The change in preferences came when cane sugar became a cheaper commodity; there was no longer any reason to use maple syrup (or maple sugar) if you weren't looking for the maple flavor.<p>I used to make my own maple syrup, back when I lived in the US-- it was a lot of work, but a lot of fun.",1320569433

Most of them were pure dumb money in this case.  The majority of big-name investors participated only in the last $950M round in Dec 10/Jan 11, which, as is widely known, went almost entirely into the pocket of management and earlier investors.  The new VCs added no value, weren't on the board, and were just along for what they assumed would be a short ride between their investment and IPO.  It was a momentum bet, pure and simple.  One can certainly make money that way, but I doubt it's how they think of themselves (or when they tell themselves when looking in the mirror).  There are times when VCs add lots of value.

3202181,comment,3202081,3202081,37,0,antirez,,,"I appreciate the ""public service"" intend of this blog post, however:<p>1) It is wrong to evaluate a system for bugs now fixed (but you can evaluate a software development process this way, however it is not the same as MongoDB itself, since the latter got fixed).<p>2) A few of the problems claimed are hard to verify, like subsystems crashing, but users can verify or deny this just looking at the mailing list if MongoDB has a mailing list like the Redis one that is ran by an external company (google) and people outside 10 gen have the ability to moderate messages. (For instance in Redis two guys from Citrusbytes can look/moderate messages, so even if I and Pieter would like to remove a message that is bad advertising we can't in a deterministic way).<p>3) New systems fails, especially if they are developed in the current NoSQL arena that is of course also full of interests about winning users ASAP (in other words to push new features fast is so important that perhaps sometimes stability will suffer). I can see this myself as even if my group at VMware is very focused on telling me to ship Redis as stable as possible as first rule, sometimes I get pressures about releasing new stuff ASAP <i>from the user base itself</i>.<p>IMHO it is a good idea if programmers learn to test very well the systems they are going to use with simulations for the intended use case. Never listen to the Hype, nor to detractors.<p>On the other side all this stories keep me motivated in being conservative in the development of Redis and try avoiding bloats and things I think will ultimately suck in the context of Redis (like VM and diskstore, two projects I abandoned).",1320569045

But somehow the clearer/milder syrup got the higher 'grade'. Why? And what 'evolution' of ""our sense of American identity"" has outraced the labeling?

How would the browser know if the server-generated content is a RSS feed, a image or a HTML page?<p>Are you seriously suggesting it's the <i>browser</i> which should support whatever scripting backend which is used on the server?<p>Mime-types is there for a reason.",1217728755

265312,comment,265237,265288,0,0,prospero,,,"The ACLU'S weird about that sort of stuff, inasmuch as they seem to mostly object to indiscriminate surveillance.  I work for a company that does ""smart"" surveillance, which allows for both improved cross-referencing of footage and a finer grained control over who can see what.  Depending which side of the coin is being discussed, they'll either demonize or canonize us, without ever acknowledging that they've had different stances in the past.<p>All in all, I think they don't have a clearly defined stance on any of this.  A lot of camera installations in cities are surprisingly ineffective (too many feeds to monitor in real time, usually at absurdly low frame rates because there's not enough disk space to hold onto high quality video), and I think this makes them low priority targets as far as the ACLU is concerned.  It will be interesting to see what they do once the technology really comes of age and a few operators can actually correlate footage from a city-wide installation.",1217725878

But, I'm not sure it's going to look exactly like the patronage model described...but probably close enough, if you squint.",1217725840

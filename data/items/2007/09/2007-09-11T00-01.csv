53063,comment,53060,53060,0,0,amichail,,,"""We study the problem of sorting in the presence of noise. While sorting linear orders is a classical well
studied problem, the introduction of noise poses very interesting challenges. Noise has to be considered
when ranking or sorting is applied in many real life scenarios.<p>A natural example comes from sports. How do we rank a league of soccer teams based on the outcome
of the games? It is natural to assume that there is a true underlying order of which team is better and that
the games outcome represent noisy versions of the pairwise comparisons between teams. Note that in this
problem it is impossible to aEURoere-sampleaEURX the order between a pair of teams. As a second example, consider
experts comparing various items according to their importance where each pair of elements is compared by
one expert. It is natural to assume that the experts opinions represent a noisy view of the actual order of
significance. The question is then how to aggregate this information?""",1189471342

#1, I think you have to head to the Valley and find another hacker. #2, maybe you could pay for two months rent for #1 and travel costs? Hopefully by then you could have another hacker and get this thing out. It seems that YC would help but it sounds like you need to do this with or w/o YC. <p>Have you launched the beta yet?

53042,comment,52936,52936,0,0,geebee,,,"The first startup I ever worked for was in LA - a film compositing software company.  The scene isn't nearly as big as silicon valley, of course, but I wouldn't be surprised if tech startups related to the film industry are more common in LA.  <p>It's a cool area, too, especially if you have a math background.  Plus, you can get academy awards :)  The founder of the company I worked for had three, and another dude I worked with had one.  Of course, these are the sci&tech ones, not the ones you see on TV.  But they do send a cute actress to host it.<p>One thing I'd say in favor of LA - the entertainment industry may be hard driven, but they sure do reward talent.  If you rock on the tech side, there is trememdous opportunity.

The OP wrote the existing code, which is allegedly what happened to ConnectU. Of course, if you discount the allegations and assume that Zuckerberg wrote the code himself, then the existing code argument is irrelevant.<p>This is an interesting debate that can actually be answered if the OP chimed in to explain what he meant!<p>Re ConnectU: I never assumed that ConnectU would have been successful if Facebook hadn't happened. In fact, I believe that the only way ConnectU would have been successful is if Mark Zuckerberg stayed on that project (or _maybe_ if ConnectU made him sign a NCA).",1189469162

The sooner you can assess the likelihood they are capable of committing the better. <p>My guess is that the best tactic in this case is to figure out way to convince them the startup is happening with or without them.

No matter what the listed discounts are on the website, they'll always feel like a custom quote is a better deal (because it's part of the salesman's job to give them that feeling).<p>AFAIK Dell does offer automated quotes (I found these <a href=""http://www.dell.com/us/en/business/servers/rack_optimized/ct.aspx?refid=rack_optimized&s=bsd&cs=04&~tab=4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dell.com/us/en/business/servers/rack_optimized/ct...</a> for example) - and even he says ""I even put the $4000 server that I want to buy in my shopping cart"".<p>So what I think he means he gets the automated quote, but since it's not the 'special offer' he's used to getting directly from the sales guy, he's unhappy.<p>So it seems that the blog author loves the hardware - but not enough to purchase it at the price listed on the website.<p>My question in general is, how good are the discounts you get from these a sales guys, typically?<p>And my question to the blog author is: How much of a discount are you losing now, that you'll compromise on the hardware you wanted.",1257447549

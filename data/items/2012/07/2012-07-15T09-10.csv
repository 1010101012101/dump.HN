4246617,comment,4245737,4246370,5,0,einhverfr,,,"I think the obvious solution is to stop worrying about what's perfect on paper and instead approach things from two very simple questions:<p>1)  What are my use cases? and<p>2)  What should be abstracted in order to create the cleanest interfaces with the most predictable behavior?<p>3)  What should be exposed to ensure that debugging is easiest?  The answer here is simple, ""everything.""<p>I think if we focus on clean interfaces based on use cases, we get something better.<p>The problem with the book example is that a book is something that is very hard to optimize both for reading and composition at the same time.  If I am writing a book, the functionality I need access to is very different than if I am reading it.  For reading, it's probably sufficient to have some methods to access the table of contents, list of tables, list of figures, etc. and the index, and a single method:  get_page(int) which returns a page of text, which can then be processed, and if sentences move on to the next page, we just fetch the next page and process it too.  For writing, however, you are going to have trees connected to linked lists, and it will be very different.  I may want to change a paragraph, or add a new one.<p>But a book is a bad example, because it is internally structured in the way we think of it in order to be functional.  In other words, with a book, the internal structure is the user interface along with helpful guides like the ToC and index.  A better approach would be to note that the actual structure of the ToC, LoT, LoF, etc. doesn't need to correspond to the actual paper and so the data structures underneath could be very different, but the overall programming interface would probably mirror the actual paper structure pretty closely.<p>Now, if you were representing a book binding process, or book repair process programmatically that might be more interesting.",1342345815

4246614,comment,4243713,4245436,1,0,ralfn,,,">As to your claims about how my post ""feels"", please take your feelings and place them somewhere appropriate.<p>That's uncalled for. I was being polite in my choice of words. Let me spell it out for you: Your story is the type of story a lawyer would write, to make a case in a front of a jury. Convincing in the mind, but totally unrealistic in reality. We could grab strangers from the street, and they would be able to tell the devices apart in a heartbeat.<p>For starters, the aspect ratio of Samsung devices and Apple devices is completely different. Yes, both products have rounded corners. Exactly like any other every mobile device in the last 20 years, because otherwise they would tear your clothes. Yes, they are as flat as they can be: again, not suprising.<p>There is often only one natural, optimal way for a vendor to engineer a device using the components that can now be produced at full-scale. The reason Samsung and Apple products look so much alike, is because they contain pretty much the same components: Apple products are essentially Samsung products with an Apple logo slapped on them. From the screens, to the chipsets.<p>So, for their products to look more alike is not that weird: they have been designed for the exact same set of limitations. (the form factor of Samsung components)<p>Finally, fashion does exist, and it is not owned by whoever happens to set the trend. From high heels, to low cut jeans, that's not so much copying designs, as it is about market research and listening to your customers.<p>And the right to 'own' a design requires that design to be superfluous. The three adidas bars are protected. The nike logo is protected. But nobody can sell a white T-shirt, and claim that design their own.<p>You can own branding. Copying designs is illegal only when it actually leads to consumer confusion, as an extension of trademarks. Apple isn't trying to own its design: it trying to own the whole concept of minimalism. That's function over form: and I personally love that, but you can't expect society to give any company a monopoly on minimalism.<p>Everybody is allowed to produce a white T-shirt. But only one company is allowed to put an apple on the back of that shirt.",1342345748

Active Patterns are the closest thing to First class patterns in a production language * .<p>Haskell has a similar thing in views. But I think another concept, unique to and playing better to its strengths, while attacking this level of problem are Generalized Algebraic Datatypes. I mentions GADTs because it deals specifically with <i>""This is somewhat limited: you cannot easily write code that is generic over the constructor at the head of the pattern. ""</i> Like I said, I've never heard of the pattern calculus - is there any problem it solves that could not be solved with GADTs with a similar level of effort?<p>* certainly biased but I see active pattern use more than I see extractors or views",1342345713

2) a specific old OS (windows 98 or XP maybe) (for having a predictable address to which to inject the shell code)(I can't imagine an ASM code doing base of registry scanning in less than 4k to get an address of a peculiar exec/lib);
3) since it is based on specific 64bits alignment problem and since there are 32bits legacy application) it would target only the 64bits version<p>This makes the threat looks more like ripples in a glass of water than the tsunami that was announced.<p>Basically this (if it is not the hoax I think it is) would be <i>just</i> an exploit of a specific browser in 64bits version on a specific OS.

It used to look like this in earlier proposal:<p><pre><code>  macro def addTwo(c: Context)(x: c.Expr[Int]): c.Expr[Int] = c.reify(x + 2)

Here c.reify is similar to quoting in lisp version. It really should have been something like:<p><pre><code>  macro def addTwo(x: Expr[Int]): Expr[Int] = reify(x + 2)

It almost feels like they are making syntax more cumbersome on purpose to make inexperienced people not to use it.

If you're developing something web related, PHP is certainly worth considering (especially in your case, as you have experience with it).<p>Just a few quick thoughts:<p>PHP is - in most cases - very tightly coupled to the HTTP request. This can be good or bad depending on what you're building. Doing a lot of offline processing? Probably bad. Serving up web pages? Probably good.<p>There's no (or little) state with PHP (you do have the session, which can be pushed to memcache), so - generally speaking - running your application across a bunch of web nodes isn't too hard to implement (even scaling the horrible legacy style code that helps give PHP a bad reputation shouldn't be <i>too</i> hard). This may or may not be important to you.<p>There's really no one true way with PHP - it can be used for a simple 10 line script, or for a large scale web application.

Yet, it has little to do with OO in the traditional Javaesque kind of sense. Encapsulation does not require an object to achieve. Hickey says OO a'la carte and splits up the conflated concepts.<p>The reason he says to use a map or a list is because of another conflation danger. If you have an opaque book - you have a book but not its underlying representation - then if you want to represent multiple these, you should make the container ""exposed"". Because that choice is the modular one. All the functions which operate on my container can now be used. For instance (MAP spellcheck books).

It's because we are doing more with less and commoditizing the types of work they were doing.</i><p>Efficiency in production makes society as a whole richer, not poorer. For example, programming computers to drive cars will ultimately enable a lot of taxicab drivers to do other things to help society that they couldn't do before because they were busy driving. When self-driving cars become widespread, society will benefit because it will have the same benefits of transportation that the taxicab drivers used to provide as well as the new goods and services the former drivers are now providing. The fallacy that machinery reduces wealth and employment is debunked in longer form by Henry Hazlitt in Economics in One Lesson.

4246570,comment,4246233,4246233,3,0,dmor,,,"Small businesses can be tricky for a number of reasons.  The biggest challenge is that they are generally run by 1 or 2 people who are aged 40 - 60 years old, and these folks aren't online all that much as they busily running their companies.  Add to that the fact that they may be distrustful of the Internet and things they find there.<p>Before you go crazy on channels online it might be a good idea to think through why they go online and what their intent is when they are there.  Maybe its to socialize with friends/kids/family on Facebook, but more likely it is to do research or read the news.<p>Research = Search will probably play a huge role in your business getting discovered<p>News = PR is the way they're going to discover you without doing an explicit search<p>I would also go where the small business owners are - FORUMS!  Find out where they are talking and get yourself and your company into the conversation.  These forums and communities are usually segmented by industry: real estate, hospitality, restaurants, beauty, retail, etc. and then sometimes even sub-categories within that<p>My gut says you will probably have to combine online self-service sales with some amount of more direct sales to make this work.  If you have something free that they can play with and give you their email for, then a followup email or phone call within 24 hours could go a long way toward winning them over (and you'll come to understand them better in the process)",1342343612

Sure they're on FB and (maybe) Twitter - but for the most part you will need to be face to face<p>It also depends on ""how small"". Are we taking store front shops or companies with 50+ people? Small to me is a company with under 25 employees. But You might have a different idea.<p>Ok some suggestions:<p>1. The local Chamber of Commerce (not the national group, but the local one). You probably have a few in your city. Pick the biggest. Join and start going to the networking groups. You'll need business cards, by the way. Oh and since you mentioned Real Estate - The Chamber always has lawyers and Real estate agents in attendence . :)<p>The Chamber also hosts leads groups and other events where you can showcase your services.<p>2. Another example, assuming you selling to the geeks that work at these business, the local tech meets. In FTL Microsoft hosts  monthly meetings/parties. Doesn't matter if you run MS or not. Everyone trolls through it at one time or another. A great place to be networking. Again bring, lots of business cards.<p>There are various other events. But really.. you have to go where your customers are.<p>Also, fine turning your google search is a good idea. But if you selling to this market, don't expect them to find you on google. In fact, they probably don't know what you do. So you gotta train your potential customer. The Chamber events are great place for this; proving to your potential customers why <i>they</i> <i>need</i> <i>you</i>.<p>Also if you selling nationally your best bet is to setup sales people in those areas who can work off commissions. Sort of what the local carriers do.",1342343500
4246568,comment,4244787,4244787,14,0,nkoren,,,"It's worth noting that a world without coral reefs is hardly unprecedented. Approximately 14,000 years ago, every coral reef in the world would have been destroyed by Meltwater Pulse 1A[1], an event which caused sea levels to rise by 20 metres in just a few hundred years. Although this must have caused the demise of the complex reef ecosystems, coral itself survived, presumably as isolated individuals and very small clusters. Afterwards, sea levels continued to rise rapidly, and the large reefs that we have today could not become established until about 7,000 years ago, when the sea levels finally stabilised. The corresponding ecosystems have evolved only since then.<p>For this reason, I am mostly unconvinced that the (admittedly horrible) disruption which we are causing today will irrevocably knock things back to a precambrian state. When you look at history of our planet over evolutionary timescales, you see all kinds of disruptive events -- rapidly rising or falling seas; bolide impacts as powerful as tens of millions of nuclear bombs -- which the planet has managed to shrug off with apparent ease. With one exception, most of the harm we are causing seems to be along these lines. So even if the great reefs die off, then my expectation would be that coral itself would continue to survive in niches. 10,000 years from now -- long after we've wised up or died off -- there could very well be great reefs again, and our disruption would be relegated to a small blip in the overall evolutionary record. The planet's losses will ultimately be minimal; the <i>real</i> losers will be our children, who will inherit a less beautiful and wondrous world than the one we know. I've swum through coral reefs, and it's painful to think that the next few dozen generations won't be able to experience that kind of beauty. But from the planet's perspective -- looking at evolutionary timescales -- this may not be a particularly big deal.<p>The one real and substantial caveat to my nonchalance is ocean acidification. It is truly global compared to other forms of ocean pollution, acts as a disruptor to individual cells rather than to the (more resilient than we give them credit for) ecosystem relationships, and is making an excursion that may be unprecedented in the past 300 million years. In contrast to things like changes in sea levels and temperatures -- which actually happen <i>all the time</i> when you take the long view -- evolutionary timescales give no assurance that ocean acidification will be a survivable event. It is something that merits a much higher level of attention than it's getting.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltwater_pulse_1A"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltwater_pulse_1A</a>",1342343434

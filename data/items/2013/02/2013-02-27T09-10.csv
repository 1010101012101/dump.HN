The population would explode (even more than it currently is) because far fewer people were dying and most people were still having sex and creating more immortals. At some future point (probably not too far away) there would not be enough food on the planet to sustain the lives of all the people living on it. This would lead to mass starvation and/or world wars over land to grow food.<p>Unless our research into creating immortals also throws up a way for us to photosynthesize, it's really not worth it.

For a student they definitely should learn a language based on external factors (marketability of the skill, ubiquity, applicability to other languages, etc).<p>To the OP, Java is a great language for students to learn. It's OOP through and through (with the exception of primitive types). It's probably a prerequisite on more job ads than any other language (at least outside the HN microcosm). It allows you to discover a whole world of Java tools and libraries. Any language you transition to will have a whole audience of people moving to it from Java/C and language designers take this into consideration for their syntax.

The environment provides exploration, reasoning about the code as a whole and refactoring at a level that no text editor or traditional IDE can match.<p>IBM VisualAge for Java was actually mostly VisualAge Smalltalk under the covers and provided a Java dev experience that for me has never been matched.

Better health leads to more productivity and higher GDP because instead of sitting in a hospital, being miserable at home due to disability, or dying prematurely, you are productive, working, and consuming.<p>Working less <i>does not necessarily</i> drop GDP if it is offset by an increase in productivity. If I work 8 hours with 1 unit of GDP/hour, that is the same as working 4 hours with 2 units of GDP/hour.<p>Are you saying that free software lowers GDP? That connection is by no means clear cut. Again, we can potentially see productivity gains in terms of lower costs across the board.<p>I do not (and never did) disagree with you that GDP doesn't cover every metric that ought to be measured (i.e. happiness). I'm correcting you because I think your economic reasoning is flawed for most of your examples. And as it stands, trying to measure ""well-being"" and quantify that value in terms of prices is so utterly nebulous as a concept as to be nearly impractical. Who would set and enforce the price? How would you even begin to convert happiness to money?<p>EDIT (reply to below):<p>First, there is no question that premature death will negatively impact GDP. Furthermore, health problems that don't lead to a hospital stay but lead to general disability will drag down productivity. Furthermore, while in the short term a hospital stay in of itself (lets say, a $100,000 bill for lung cancer) will increase GDP by the bill ($100,000), that money partly comes out of savings that would be spent anyway in the long term. And the ability for someone to create value as a productive worker/consumer is still severely curtailed as a result. And while I'll concede that reducing hospital stays in of itself has a negative effect to GDP, improvements in health end up being net positive for GDP.<p>As for the larger philosophical question of GDP. Who is ""we""? The economy will optimize for itself (higher GDP) because that is how a market economy is set up. And a market economy is not set up to optimize for anything other than growth/money (money representing economic value). As for ""people,"" people, society, and governments routinely already optimize for other things.",1361957979

(They can't be modifying x264 itself since they'd then need to submit their source code changes upstream, if I've read the other replies right.)<p>If all they're doing is turning x264's settings knobs, they'll have to have studied the effects of those knobs in depth. I can hardly see how any analysis they're doing can be usefully turned into settings for x264. I find it a bit difficult to phrase my reasoning, but I'll try:<p>-----<p>- Trying to outdo x264's analysis at optimizing for perceptual quality <i>while still depending on it</i> is like <i>trying to optimize a car engine from the driver's seat</i>. It's not likely to happen.<p>- x264's settings are, generally speaking, macroscopic - they apply to the whole video segment. (You can apply different settings to different segments, but in the end your control is still limited by whatever knobs x264 offers.)<p>- If there were a way to optimize things better than x264 has, it almost certainly requires working directly within the encoder's analysis code itself rather than carrying out a pre-encoding analysis process and then fiddling with rough-control knobs. I simply doubt the complex interplay of settings within x264 lends itself to mere knob-turning. Many of the settings are mainly for making tradeoffs among the impossible trinity of <i>encoding speed</i> vs <i>output quality</i> vs <i>output bitrate</i>, rather than to allow the encoder to improve the output perceptually (because that's x264's job).<p>- Even if they managed to build a pre-analysis model that figures out decent settings to feed into x264, it would break to some extent whenever x264's code/algos are changed. That doesn't seem like a stable base to build a business on.<p>- All the above reasoning is overkill, because the settings the Beamr encoder turned out look <i>outright silly</i> to me: setting b-frames to 0 is just shooting x264 in the foot (b-frames are central to bitrate savings through discarding unnecessary visual data). Plus it turns off mb-tree and psy in 3 out of 4 samples, which basically discards two of x264's more powerful adaptive bitrate-vs-quality features. (mb-tree detects motion and saves bits on and around moving objects; psy is various optimizations for psychological quality perception, e.g. grain level.) It's just plain regressive.<p>-----<p>More fundamentally, the claim that ""a minimum bitrate for visually lossless encoding of a video can be found"" is quite doubtful, because of the fuzziness of the claim and its assumptions. The trouble is, a pure marketing line like this is easy to sell to a non-technical crowd. And x264 is good enough that anyone re-encoding a crappy source with it will find good bitrate savings, even with dumb settings.<p>Anyone looking to encode video in the cloud should instead use a well-priced, well-tuned service that doesn't overstate its case. Daiz suggested Zencoder, so it's probably a good bet. People who just want to shrink videos should grab Handbrake or any other x264-using encoder package, and use one of the presets (or just stick to the defaults). The result will probably be better than this service, as things stand.<p>(Thanks for patrolling the video frontier, Daiz.)",1361956979

These seem like reasonable criticisms, but I think they miss the point.<p>Many of you, if not most, are in the software industry. You try to solve interesting problems every day, or, at least, you'd like to. Every industry and every field has the need to solve them, at least with my definition of 'interesting'.<p>Solving such a problem is difficult. It requires knowing very clearly about the rules of engagement, and mapping out strategies for tackling the issue. It requires an understanding of the lay of the land, but also the capacity to think outside the box. In short, it is exactly what all of you would expect from a 'good' programmer - the ability to think actively.<p>You'll notice that I make no claims of this sort about physicians. The best doctors may do these things, but most doctors don't. And at the very least, doctors certainly are not trained in ways of solving problems effectively. Instead, we are mostly trained in pattern recognition.<p>So what? Do I think a doctor would benefit from learning to program? Yes. Because figuring out how to writing a complex program is not so different from doing a complex surgery. Understanding algorithms is not so different from producing a good differential diagnosis. Most importantly, if we want to solve big problems we can't always rely on an engineer from the outside looking in and solving it for us.<p>Programming forces you to explain your understanding to something that is very stupid (in a way). If you don't understand what you're doing, your program doesn't work. That basic check doesn't exist for doctors. Ask your doctor what a graph of y = 1/x looks like. Then ask him to graph alveolar CO2 vs ventilation. You should be really afraid of how many doctors only know the latter. I would guess some of them even wouldn't know that! (but they probably know what to do with a patient who's hyperventilating, because they'd memorized it)<p>Programming is the means to the end, not the end. All this talk of APIs and IDEs and C vs Python vs Javascript really seem to miss the bigger picture here. The best way we have of teaching thinking is with programming (IMHO) and there has to be a way of teaching programming by getting all of the annoying crap out of the way. And we desperately do need more people who have the capacity to think and solve problems. Maybe not will.i.am or Chris Bosh or even software junkies in the valley, but definitely in every other industry.<p>EDIT: small grammar edit, no content change.",1361956300

9980325,comment,9977092,9980288,0,0,SeoxyS,,,"The real problem comes from the fact that any amount of stock that would generate significant return becomes prohibitively expensive to exercise. If you&#x27;re granted 100k shares at $5/share, and they could eventually sell at $15/share; it does you very little good, because there&#x27;s no way you can swing the half a million bucks it&#x27;ll take to exercise in order to make your uncertain $1M profit.<p>On the other hand, if it&#x27;s an amount of options you can afford to exercise (e.g. 1k shares @ $5 = $5k… most people could scrap together the funds for that.), your profit is unlikely to be more that 2-5x, which likely would return $10k, and at the most $25k on your $5k investment.

9980322,comment,9979234,9979869,0,0,Manishearth,,,"&quot;Rust can leak memory&quot; is an overgeneralization of the issue and misrepresents it.<p>Rust doesn&#x27;t break RAII in the usual sense. The leak issue in Rust is not something that can be cleanly talked of in the context of other languages.<p>In all languages with RAII till now, it&#x27;s possible to &quot;leak&quot; memory by sending things to a permablocked thread, or stuffing them in a global hashmap, or whatever. This is something that no compiler can prevent, and it may even be desired at times.<p>Rust has always allowed this sort of &quot;leaking&quot;. So have all the other languages out there.<p>However, Rust has the concept of scoped/borrowed data -- data with a lifetime which cannot escape that scope. Stuff that isn&#x27;t scoped is said to be `&#x27;static`, i.e. it&#x27;s lifetime can be the lifetime of the whole program (we can keep moving it out of functions and throwing it between threads). Scoped data can&#x27;t be shoved into a global hashmap or sent to a random blocked thread, because it&#x27;s not allowed to escape its scope.<p>Except, it turns out that using stuff like Rc cycles, it&#x27;s possible to leak such data too. This affects RAII guards which use lifetimes to bind themselves to a scope to say &quot;run destructors when this particular scope ends&quot; (this is different from &quot;run destructors when this object is no longer accessible&quot;, because with regular objects they can be hoisted into a larger scope by moving).<p>Note that the entire issue is about _scoped_ data (data with a lifetime, containing borrowed references), which is not a concept that exists in other languages.<p>So Rust still provides de-facto leak safety via RAII, it&#x27;s just that it is possible in safe Rust to leak stuff, but you have to be explicit about it (global hashmap, mem::forget, etc). This is unlike languages where you must `delete` the object explicitly to avoid leaks.",1438325818

Pandora and Apple Music are both heavily tailored that way. Google Now on your phone knows everything you do. Netflix can find videos for you to watch based on what you&#x27;ve watched before. Amazon will recommend purchases to you based on what you like. Hell, half the people on this site build these systems. You know how many machine learning articles there are on the front page every week?<p>But that&#x27;s the thing, right ? People want their computers to be more intelligent, reactive, adapted to their needs. They don&#x27;t want Google, MS or Apple to know everything about them. How did the first came to automatically imply the second ?<p>Apple, Google, MS and others could deliver the same products (software that learn user behaviour and adapt accordingly) without sacrificing privacy, invading personal space and storing private documents on the cloud in order to parse it to deliver relevant ads.<p>Machine learning should keep on trying to be machine learning and not solely data scraping for marketing tuning and exploitation.<p>What does it bring me that MS or Google knows my search terms of the day ? I want my quad-core CPU to know that when I browse HN it should automatically split the screen in half and open my media player to listen to radio music because that&#x27;s what I do most morning.

I like HPMOR, but... not necessarily because it&#x27;s rational?<p>I mean, Eliezer is an impressive writer whose style resonates with many people. And it&#x27;s indeed frustrating to see idiocy in fiction, like in Star Trek where the most powerful weapon is obviously the teleporter but no one acknowledges that. We can all agree on these things.<p>The problem is that removing idiocy doesn&#x27;t automatically make a piece of fiction good. It seems like Eliezer has convinced a ton of nerds (I hate the word but let&#x27;s roll with it) that they can succeed in writing fiction by applying this one weird trick. But you need much more than that.<p>Our enjoyment of stories comes mainly from emotions, which we then rationalize by saying &quot;I liked that story because the hero was really smart&quot;. A few people have noticed that the actual plotlines in HPMOR are kinda weak, and it&#x27;s really the characterization and &quot;epic&quot; style that makes the story work. A version of HPMOR that was just &quot;smart&quot;, with better intrigue but less emotional appeal, wouldn&#x27;t attract nearly as many people. A version of Worm without the raw moments of suffering would be kinda pointless to read. These things don&#x27;t come for free if you just try to write rationally.<p>To conclude, here&#x27;s a few recommendations:<p>- If you want to read a work that succeeds purely based on rationality, without much emotion or characterization, check out The Metropolitan Man. It&#x27;s probably the best example of its kind, and a damn good read too.<p>- If you know your way around the Harry Potter universe and want another good fanfic in that setting, try The Seventh Horcrux. It doesn&#x27;t give a fuck about rationality, but it&#x27;s so amazing that you won&#x27;t care.<p>- If you want something extremely smart, well written, and emotional at the same time, read anything by Ted Chiang. I&#x27;ll never stop recommending him.",1438325155

Without the 7-year rule then the upside isn&#x27;t so clear cut, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they are near worthless at all.<p>Second, companies really don&#x27;t grow that quickly.  Over a 1 or 2 year time horizon, even a really successful company will 2x-4x in value (and the common stock might grow even less than this).  If the strike price was low on the original grant, the strike price will also probably be pretty low on the refresher grant.  Especially at early stages of a company&#x27;s life when the options are priced at essentially zero, even if you 5 or 10x the value, the strike price will still be very low.<p>When you have more established companies and higher strikes prices, it is less of an issue because there might be a shorter term path to liquidity which takes away risk of exercising without being able to sell the stock.",1438325110

The central factor is not the strike price, but the spread between your strike price and what you can eventually sell at (which should hopefully be higher than any strike price set at the last 409A). If you get an initial grant at $1/share, and then a later grant of the same number of options at $5/share, then is the later grant worth 1/5 of the initial one? No - if you end up selling for $15/share, then it&#x27;s a difference between getting $14/share and $10/share pre-tax. It only ends up being a much worse deal if the strike price of the later grant is very close to what you later sell at, in which case your company is flatlining.",1438325105

Assume you assess the expected value of the equity grant to be, let&#x27;s say, $100k over 4 years.  Then this means your total comp will rise by $10k a year, which probably is comparable to your natural gain in market value.  Thus this is equivalent to taking a similar offer except with $40k in equity with linear vesting, and either getting a raise or switching companies to get the $10k/year raise.<p>What this analysis omits is that the expected value calculation ignores the fact that the equity far exceeding the expected value is correlated with a desire to stay at the company, which makes the backloaded vesting irrelevant.<p>If you interpolate a bit to account for that correlation, I personally started concluding the $100k offer became more like $50-60k, which dropped the offer below market rate and I walked.",1438324500

You figure out what the data flow is, read up the API doc, and build some kind of process that does it in 5 minutes in bash on a medium instance on AWS, whilst fixing the errors the macros were making.<p>Will it be an easy sell? You were expressedly brought in to do this, but you&#x27;ll find that the manager in charge of the 150 people - let&#x27;s call him the CXO - is going to fight every inch of the way to stop you from launching your product. He&#x27;ll point at the diff between his crappy but nevertheless, in production stuff and your script as cause for audit, creating a weeks/months long review process (because nobody can find the time, or wants to take the responsibility and the fight). He&#x27;ll blame you for creating a &quot;toxic&quot; work environment. He&#x27;ll bog you down in endless 2h long lunchtime meetings unrelated to the main point in an attempt to make you lose your professionalism in front of external stakeholders. He&#x27;ll list missing new features then put them through the audit process.<p>Eventually, once a few months have been wasted, he&#x27;ll point at your lack of progress as a sign of your incompetence, even though the working version was ready to be rolled out months ago. Nobody will question him because the company is profitable and it doesn&#x27;t really matter how the process is done, just that it gets done. So, you leave the project, pocketing your pay - which they will pay on time so you don&#x27;t make a fuss - and things continue as before for the CXO and his team, perhaps even gaining approval for a further 50 in headcount to develop the new features or to compensate for the expensive SQL and scripting training (MS stack, of course) that he&#x27;s sending his entire team to in batches, whilst you&#x27;ll have made a bad impression on that company&#x27;s management and be burnt out of their network.<p>The CXO benefits outside the company as well, as he can now say he managed XYZ employees which is how people automatically gauge someone&#x27;s success. This enables a succession of ever greater responsibility positions (or entry to Harvard Business School, who actually asks you &quot;how many reports did you have&quot;). &quot;Well, if the previous place trusted him with 150 people...&quot;<p>It&#x27;s even worse in startup space because VCs and many founders understand that growth at all costs is what matters, so there are significant incentives to doing it today, even if badly, vs doing it tomorrow but well and in a way that doesn&#x27;t pile technical debt. It&#x27;s a winner takes all, so you just need to pour in enough millions and you&#x27;ll reap the billions (in fact this is also the very structure of a VC&#x27;s portfolio, investing in 10 different ways of doing the same thing in the hope one wins, even if it means the others all die).<p>So some founders may be doubly incentivized: making the company as large and cash flow burning as possible both to appear like the obvious winner, and to justify mammoth fund raises at a time of abundant capital seeking yield; and, if things go wrong, well, they managed hundreds of millions of VC dollars and hundreds or thousands of people in dozens of global offices and it sounds damn good for their next try.<p>And this is where both WhatsApp and Instagram did things differently: they focused on getting the user growth scalable without enormous headcount growth, whilst - at least in Whatsapp&#x27;s case - having enough cash flow to hold on until the mega acquisition (and in Instagram&#x27;s case, sustaining the company on the early rounds). Pointing at lack of revenue is not particularly useful - I would say even a red herring - when even SaaS companies go 5-10 years without showing profitability and with enormous fund raises for growth (just look at the analytics space for recent examples).<p>The hedge fund space - which is almost by definition results driven - has already caught on - Bridgewater type funds with a thousand employees are the exception rather than the rule and seeing AUM over a billion USD per head is more common than &quot;unicorn&quot; startups.",1438324399

Security is probably the hardest thing to guarantee when all the source is out there. It takes quite a while to secure against all the obvious attacks, while attackers can see all the code. I&#x27;d trust gmail for security before I trust some small host which installed squirrelmail.<p>But having said that, I think that the reason a lot of stuff becomes centralized is because SOCIAL is not decentralized today. Bitcoin decentralized money but user accounts, profiles, connections etc are still done in a centralized way. That&#x27;s why GitHuv and is centralized even though git is not. Social and security - if there were solutions to these, many people would decentralize.<p>And by decentralized, I mean you still have a server hosting your stuff, but it would be your choice - it could be on a local network, and you wouldn&#x27;t even need the internet.

While not everything was perfect, it&#x27;s better than a lot of stuff I&#x27;ve paid for.<p>I remember really enjoying some of the early points where there are jabs at what characters do in fiction generally.

9980204,comment,9977785,9978405,0,0,lastofus,,,"You mention you are a loyal C developer. As someone who learned C as my first language and used it for years (along with C++ and Java), I found I enjoy programming significantly more when I&#x27;m using an expressive high level language like Python.<p>When it becomes 10x easier to express complex ideas and algorithms with a fraction of the code by making use of built-in language features, it&#x27;s a breath of fresh air. The huge ecosystem of easy-to-use libraries for most anything doesn&#x27;t hurt either. I can enjoy focusing on the problem I&#x27;m trying to solve instead of how to structure my code, what design pattern I should be using due to a limited static type system, how best to avoid memory corruption or seg faults, etc. It&#x27;s akin to writing pseudo code, and then having it execute.<p>Another great thing about Python in particular is that it ends to be extremely easy to read other people&#x27;s code due to semantic whitespace and also by language design of there only being one way to do things.<p>If Python turns out to be your thing, it&#x27;s popular in data science/machine learning. If you lean in that direction, you may be able to work more on some complex math/stats problems and less on writing/maintaining large low-level codebases.<p>Also, that feeling that your code is not perfect is really common. I&#x27;ve been programming for ~20 years and it has never gone away. What&#x27;s helped me a lot is focusing on the end result of the product, and its impact on the business and the value it creates. As someone who wants every line of code to be error free, as performant as possible, and properly structured, I find comfort knowing my &quot;good enough&quot; solution (and sometimes not-so-good solution) is making business owners and end-users more than happy.",1438323481

9980192,comment,9977322,9979720,0,0,mikekchar,,,"Based on what you are saying, I would recommend reading some Japanese manga.  Manga follows a different story structure from western fiction.  In western fiction you usually start the story with conflict.  The main characters resolve the conflict and the story is over.  Manga follows the Chinese epic structure where you start off with a section that simply defines the rules of the universe and introduces you to the characters.  Often it is quite light and humourous.  About halfway through the crisis develops.  Quite often this is rather hard on the reader because something incredibly nasty happens to their now beloved characters.  The rest of the story talks about how the characters resolve the conflict.<p>The main advantage of this story structure is that by setting up the rules at the beginning and spending a great deal of time introducing the characters, you have the opportunity to examine the actions of the characters in the conflict section knowing their constraints.  That way the actions and reasoning are much easier to follow and to relate to.<p>I&#x27;d like to give you advice on what to read, but I tend to enjoy fairly childish, light stuff ;-)  Although not fantasy, Barefoot Gen is pretty amazing (should be on everybody&#x27;s reading list IMHO).  I don&#x27;t personally like it, but Akira is also quite good.",1438323178

I use it daily on my own iPhone.<p>The issue is that because Crypton does crypto with JavaScript in the web view of a Cordova app, it needs to not be stupendously slow. The default iOS web view available for Cordova apps, up until iOS 8, was the UIWebView which is well known for not having access to a JIT (like Nitro in mobile Safari). This means that JavaScript crypto (particularly done the way SJCL does it) is VERY slow. We&#x27;re talking almost two minutes just to log in. :/<p>However, even though iOS 8 now provides a web view with a JIT (WKWebView), it has been slightly crippled by Apple. The WKWebView disallows loading local files except from the app&#x27;s tmp folder. This has meant some work for the Cordova iOS team to get the WKWebView working. It is finally at a stage where it can be used, but some of the changes Cordova had to make to get it working, plus some differences in WKWebView&#x27;s API, mean some changes had to be made to both Crypton and Encryptr to get it all to work.<p>It&#x27;s working now.

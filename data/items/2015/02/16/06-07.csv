If you&#x27;re a startup growing aggressively, hiring great people is so important that you end up using your personal networks not to <i>filter</i> candidates but rather to find more candidates than you&#x27;d otherwise get through people who apply cold. For our team, if we saw two brilliant engineers, a PhD who applied cold, and another wonderful fellow with a connection to our team, we&#x27;d hire both.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are some stereotypes about PhDs, but I&#x27;d be surprised to find a startup that held it against you. One piece is advice...I think showing humility is important. I&#x27;ve seen some PhDs who want to join our team and dive right in (that&#x27;s great!) while others are only interested in leading a research team or something fancy like that even though they have no work experience (that&#x27;s not great). I&#x27;ll always give someone the benefit of the doubt so I won&#x27;t assume that any PhD I meet is too big for his/her britches, but as a PhD applicant I think it&#x27;s important to understand that anyone leading hiring has probably seen plenty of PhDs who don&#x27;t come to the table with the humility you need for a startup job.<p>Last thought -- the one challenge in applying to startups is to make sure they don&#x27;t accidentally reject you, e.g. we&#x27;re a relatively small team and we get thousands of applications a year, and we try our darndest to read every one and review every code challenge and take everyone seriously. That said, I&#x27;m sure we make mistakes every now and then, and we overlook someone who&#x27;s awesome. As an applicant, one way you can avoid that is to make yourself stand out. Was your PhD research really fascinating? Have you built something cool? etc. For example, people sometimes email me as the CEO instead of applying through our web site. It happens often enough that in most cases I&#x27;ll introduce them to the head of recruiting on our team; I can&#x27;t get involved personally every time or it&#x27;s all I&#x27;d do every day. But if someone really stands out when they email me -- and in a substantive way -- I&#x27;ll pay attention.<p>Sorry man, I know the job search is hard, especially coming out of a PhD program, but the good news is that you&#x27;re in a highly competitive job market for engineers and most companies are hiring on merit.<p>PS if you&#x27;re looking in Boston, feel free to email me afeuer@panoramaed.com (Panorama YC S13)",1424069430

9055653,comment,9055177,9055267,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Hi Simone, when I installed the solar system on my house (5.2kW, 2001) we seriously looked at going &quot;off grid&quot; (which means batteries). The problem at the time was that getting a few 10&#x27;s of kWh of batteries was both quite expensive (you basically either built your own system or used an over priced data center UPS type system) and quite intense in its maintenance. Tesla is working both the reliability and the maintenance issues simultaneously.<p>That means that using their tech, with two of their battery packs (so that I can disconnect one for service/replacement while the other can run my house) would very much be an interesting &quot;feature&quot; for Solar City to offer. Typical peak power requirements of a house might hit 25kW but a car it can easily hit over 75kW (100 hp equivalent). So they have the inverter technology to build a whole house inverter.<p>The bottom line is they have built for a car, that which could be sold for houses, with the &quot;hard bits&quot; mostly solved. But that only becomes a useful thing if they excess battery capacity because I&#x27;m sure they can make far more money selling this tech wrapped up in a car than they can as a &#x27;get your house off the grid&#x27; kit.",1424068982

In one incident described in the podcast, Will describes a multiple-redundant multirotor losing a single propeller and having the vibrations of that cause a cascading failure of the other propellers, ultimately bringing the machine down in an uncontrolled manner.<p>I think that as a blanket rule it is very appropriate to not allow amateur UAS to fly directly overhead of people not aware that it is there.

I had the impression that in Germany everybody was purchasing fresh milk because in Italy there is a pattern that as you move towards the north, people are more and more hardcore with fresh milk, and there are fresh milk &quot;centrals&quot; in most cities in the north with locally produced fresh milk. I expected the pattern to continue towards north.<p>UHT milk is sold here of course but mostly used as a &quot;backup&quot;, to take a few home if you end without milk. Also micro-filtered milk is gaining in popularity for years at this point, but if I should judge the percentage of buyers from the amount of bottles I see in supermarkets, still far from fresh milk.<p>An important part of this is: fresh milk duration is 4 days max mostly for a matter of ancient regulation. With new productive chain milk gets a lot less contaminated with bacteria so usually lasts a lot more. Many people say that filtered milk is mostly about regulations than a huge difference in duration per se. What is true is that in filtered milk actually the fat is split from the rest of the milk and pasteurized at higher temperatures, and then re-added, so indeed the duration should be better, but not a lot better than fresh milk produced with a very good standards.<p>Finally, in certain parts of Sicily it is possible to purchase &quot;raw&quot; milk, not pasteurized at all, in automatic machines on the street (in the province of Ragusa, for example).

9055571,comment,9053759,9055009,0,0,dalke,,,"&quot;#1 is unsustainable outside of the hard sciences&quot;<p>I disagree. Why do people go to college? From what I&#x27;ve read, under the GI bill, a lot of people went to college because it was a place to learn. College was cheap - a minimum wage summer job was enough to pay for a year of college even for those without the GI bill. (Colleges were also much more discriminatory, including based on race, ethnicity, and class. But that&#x27;s a different story.)<p>Starting in the 1970s colleges were increasingly defunded by the states, often explicitly as a way to stifle left-wing professors and students, who come more often from humanities than science. There&#x27;s been a push since then to say that people should go to college for vocational reasons. &quot;I&#x27;ll get a better job with a college&quot; was the thought. As you point out, this then gets turned into &quot;I need to get a loan to get the degree, and the better job will pay off the loan.&quot;<p>(The college deferment for the draft no doubt also played a role.)<p>The hard sciences exception (and you should add engineering) has the twin advantages that 1) engineers and hard scientists tend to be less interested in history, politics, and the other fields which focus more on the human condition, and 2) the extra training actually is important for a job in those fields, so companies can outsource training to the colleges, who then demand money from the students for the privilege.<p>So, #1 could change if we (magically?) change our minds and insist that a college education is for higher learning, and that companies pay for job training, not students. It would also change if the government were to fund all higher education directly.<p>I&#x27;m not holding my breath.<p>In any case, even if #1 changes, I don&#x27;t think it would change the adjunct situation.<p>FWIW, based on this article about U. Chicago <a href=""http://chicagomaroon.com/2013/06/04/harboring-the-humanities/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chicagomaroon.com/2013/06/04/harboring-the-humanities...</a> , the percent of humanities undergrad degrees has actually increased over the last 10 years. &quot;In Spring 2012, 3.7 percent of all degrees in the College were awarded in philosophy, up from 2.5 percent a decade ago&quot; despite that &quot;Forbes Magazine ranks philosophy the fourth least lucrative major, with an unemployment rate of 10.8 percent for recent graduates&quot;. And the number of humanities graduate students is going down.<p>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s typical or not. If it is typical, then it suggests that #2 is not occurring.<p>As someone who was in the hard sciences, I was told there will always be jobs for people trained in physics. Then near the end of my undergrad I started reading articles about how perhaps there were too many people trained in physics.<p>This graph - <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/02/the-phd-bust-americas-awful-market-for-young-scientists-in-7-charts/273339/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/02/the-phd-...</a> - shows &quot;employment at graduation&quot; for different categories of PhD. The trend seems to be that in the hard sciences there are fewer real jobs, and more post-doc (the research equivalent to the adjunct professor) positions.<p>So it&#x27;s not clear to me that there&#x27;s significant safety in the hard sciences. It looks like engineering is the best bet.<p>Regarding #3, what you said is of course true. Mine laborers are also easily replaced, as are garment workers, teamsters, shoemakers, and . There&#x27;s a well-known solution; unionize and require it be a union shop. This of course won&#x27;t work in so-called &quot;right-to-work&quot; states, which I consider them to be anti-free market laws.<p>You&#x27;re right in proposing a #5, to &quot;just limit the use of adjunct faculty in the first place and open more tenure-track positions to replace them.&quot; I&#x27;m pretty sure that those working as adjuncts now would be fine if there were more openings for tenure-track positions and fewer adjunct positions, just like post-docs would be happy if there were more tenure track positions and fewer post-doc positions.<p>Being stuck in limbo is frustrating. My problem with your #5 is that many politicians and members of the public already believe that the major increase in university costs is due to professors&#x27; salaries, when all evidence says this isn&#x27;t the case. #5 does nothing to improve the dynamics. Neither does #3.<p>Any any case, #4/#5/passing a law seems only slightly more unlikely than #3/unionization.<p>Yes, my #4 is not going to work. But I think your objection is equally simplistic. The Washington Monthly article I linked to observes:<p>> While some administrative posts continue to be held by senior professors on a part-time basis, their ranks are gradually dwindling as their jobs are taken over by fulltime managers. College administrations frequently tout the fiscal advantages of using part-time, “adjunct” faculty to teach courses. They fail, however, to apply the same logic to their own ranks. Over the past thirty years, the percentage of faculty members who are hired on a part-time basis has increased so dramatically that today almost half of the nation’s professors work only part-time. And yet the percentage of administrators who are part-time employees has fallen during the same time period.<p>You said that &quot;you can easily get into a bubble where ...&quot;. The same is true of administrators. They can get into the same bubble regarding other administrators. Senior professors help pierce the bubble.<p>You&#x27;re right though that if 10% of the non-teaching staff could be cut then there&#x27;s no direct mechanism for &quot;magic&quot; transfer of funds. There&#x27;s an indirect one, in that tenure/tenure-track professors and adjunct staff are much more likely to be co-workers, if not friends.<p>If those professors have a more direct role in the workings of the university then the same birds-of-a-feather mentality which currently keeps &quot;armies of functionaries—vice presidents, associate vice presidents, assistant vice presidents, provosts, associate provosts, vice provosts, assistant provosts, deans, deanlets, and deanlings, all of whom command staffers and assistants&quot; with their funding suggests that a similar bubble kinship might improve the life of adjunct staff.<p>That may just be wishful thinking.",1424067146

It reminds me of the sort of made-up, seemingly-mathmatical, but ultimately befuddling stats that you sometimes here in infomercials for copper-wrist band arthritis cures.<p>The windows mouse pointer seems to work on a pixel-by-pixel basis, when moving slowly.

I'd be shocked if he didn't come to a presentation with PPT slides & Excel chart combination.  :)<p>On a more serious note, I think the idea that PPT slides full of text are helpful is basically entrenched in corporate culture.  I wish everyone used Lessig's approach.  ",1174057348

Ultimately it&#x27;s a game to be played for entertainment, and if you can get some people to think about social issues as they play it that&#x27;s wonderful, but it&#x27;s still supposed to be enjoyable. Clearly homeless people in the game are impeding some peoples enjoyment and it&#x27;s a problem that is not obvious to solve.<p>Some games that offer more freedom let you solve problems like these in more interesting ways, for example when I played Dwarf Fortress (years ago now), a common strategy was to make the nobledwarfs accommodation floodable with lava, so if they got too uppity with their demands (sometimes nobles would insist that you make certain items or not sell a certain items or they&#x27;d get furious and make everybody else unhappy) they could be dispatched. I think it&#x27;d be funny if Sim City offered a similar option.",1421837986

From the top of my head there&#x27;s about 20 meow/maw/mraw/meeaw/mwaw/mwo we can distinguish (possibly 50 if I include variations in tones and length of each phoneme).

Most &quot;teachers&quot; you&#x27;re talking about are researchers first, and lecturers second. They don&#x27;t really think about pedagogical techniques, and they&#x27;re not going to start.<p>Plus, they most definitely aren&#x27;t going to take motivational issues seriously. Most professors assume you have motivation, and if you don&#x27;t, they aren&#x27;t going to care. They&#x27;re going to let policy take care of you.<p>Also, like I&#x27;ve mentioned before, most professors are not teachers. They are lecturers. The difference is that a lecturer just spits out the information in a clean and accurate manner, but it&#x27;s your job from there to handle your learning.<p>On a gloomy ending, I would even note that most teachers ever probably don&#x27;t care for the state of pedagogical research.

In Dredd URI parameters are inherited from resource to action, but there is no way how to filter out unwanted parameters from resource under action section.<p>In this case I assume that `skip` and `take` parameters belong only to GET action (retrieving collection), so its imho a non-sense to discuss them on the resource level because they will be propagated to any action under that resource.<p>Thank you for very interesting feedback!",1421835947

But after that we had no problems with the language, when we had to implement algorithms, which would look quite similar in most other OO languages, maybe with added memory management.<p>I think JavaScript&#x27;s prototype-based inheritance and global scope would make it hard to abstract concepts learned in it to other languages. Strict ES6 might help a bit. When switching from Scheme + Java to JS, you can get the Java+Scheme mix, that JavaScript is in my eyes, and use it accordingly. Switching the other way round you would basically have to relearn the concepts, because JavaScript does not express one distinct enough, but is an exotic mix of them (or an ugly hack as others might say).<p>Outside of CS though, I think introducing people to JavaScript, PHP or even advanced Excel is highly beneficial.",1421835911

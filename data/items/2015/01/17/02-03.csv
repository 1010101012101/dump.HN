First of all you must convince a rich person/company that you are worthy. Then you must convince them that you want to work for them, that they&#x27;re special, and so on. And then later, you must defer, every single day. Ill? According to policy document AED, page 5, section b, one of your eight sick days will be deducted, worker drone!<p>It&#x27;s not enough to simply perform a valuable function for society. You need to be subservient and defer to authority - you are worth less than your betters (those with wealth) and must please them in order to eat, in order to shelter.<p>There are a few ways left in which you can directly serve other humans and profit via such - private entrepreneurial services such as window cleaning, antique dealing, etcetera - but these make up a small portion of the employment market today and are often subject to ridiculously overbearing regulation. The vast majority of &#x27;jobs&#x27; in the Western world involve being directly, by rank, inferior to another human being.<p>Other people seem much more capable of dealing with this than I do. Often I find myself resenting others for putting up with the more ridiculous aspects - it feels like a betrayal, that if only people were better human beings and less likely to defer to authority we could all have a better experience.<p>This is the struggle I face, really. Physical trauma I find very simple - the emotional aspect of actively taking part in a system that I despise is much more difficult.",1421463414

Ultimately it will come down the supreme court but I would not be surprised to see them limit the scope of Maryland.<p>>The government’s legal justification for the call-tracking program is based on a 1979 case, Smith v. Maryland, involving the surveillance of a criminal suspect over a two-day period. In that case, the Supreme Court said that Americans have no expectation of privacy in the telephone metadata that companies hold as business records, and that therefore a warrant is not required to obtain such information. A succession of judges on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court have adopted the government’s argument based on that ruling.<p>>But Leon said the question the Supreme Court confronted in 1979 is not the same as the one he was faced with. “Indeed, the question in this case can more properly be styled as follows: When do present-day circumstances — the evolutions in the government’s surveillance capabilities, citizens’ phone habits, and the relationship between the NSA and telecom companies — become so thoroughly unlike those considered by the Supreme Court thirty-four years ago, that a precedent like Smith does not apply?” he wrote. “The answer, unfortunately for the government, is now.”<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/judge-nsas-collecting-of-phone-records-is-likely-unconstitutional/2013/12/16/6e098eda-6688-11e3-a0b9-249bbb34602c_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/judge-nsas-collecting...</a>",1421463376

Koreans, despite being workaholics (in a grossly simplified general sense) have a cultural predisposition to drop everything and savor their meals. It drove me absolutely up-the-wall when we first met. Meals were something to get through as quickly as possible and then back to work.<p>But over time, as my work responsibilities have increased (and my work stress), I&#x27;ve learned to value meal time as a moment of peace in a stressful day -- an island of solitude. I take meals now with purpose, savoring every bite, spending the time to enjoy the food and simply enjoy the act of eating. I seek out places with nice atmospheres and good quality food.<p>As a result my health is better, my stress is better managed, and I find the pacing aspect of it keeps my head in the game when I return to work.<p>It&#x27;s been an important lesson I&#x27;ve continued to enjoy.<p>I know other people who don&#x27;t like this, maybe it&#x27;s an introvert/extrovert thing.

The tech interview will matter less to them because they&#x27;ve seen the value you provide.<p>* <i>Write good cover letters/mails</i><p>Your application is your first point of contact. It has to be short, crisp and make them want to know more about you. My application email is usually just one or two sentences and then 4 links (github, resume, and a couple interesting projects). If you have interesting projects in multiple languages, change them to suit the company you apply to.<p>* <i>Try to avoid any automated forms to apply to a job</i><p>They most likely end up in a blackhole at popular or larger companies. Find a person who works there and send him/her an email.<p>* <i>Don&#x27;t panic and take it slow</i><p>It took me a couple months to find a place I&#x27;ll be comfortable at.

The only thing that&#x27;s different is what goes on under your TCP/IP layers.<p>Your Phone has a modem built in, that modulates a digital signal over a carrier wave at a certain frequency (set of frequencies, depending on the channel access protocol) the modulated carrier wave is sent out to the cellphone tower.<p>When the modem is supposed to receive, when it&#x27;s allowed to send, how it negotiates these things is all strictly defined by protocols the telecom industry has standardized on. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m an expert on these protocols, there&#x27;s a whole bunch of them. They are grouped in protocol stacks with familiar names like GPRS, EDGE, UMTS, LTE.<p>These protocols besides making optimal use of their available bandwidth taking into account all kinds of noise, disturbances, moving from tower to tower, other phones also specify how the communication should be encrypted.<p>The encoding/decoding of these protocols is usually done by an integrated circuit in your phone that&#x27;s separate from the rest of the phone&#x27;s functionality, to prevent you from tampering with it (and to ensure reliability I guess).

The minimum curve radius is 3.67 km, or a length difference of 18 mm between the left and right side over the length of one pylon.<p>Assuming that all sections start as straight tubes, how much sideways force would that apply on the pylon? For that we need to calculate the &quot;flexural stiffness&quot;[1], which for a hollow cylinder is given as:<p>EI = E pi/4 (D⁴ - d⁴)<p>Where E is Young&#x27;s modulus, and D and d are the outer and inner diameter.<p>Therefore the bending moment[2] M is:<p>M = EIκ = E pi/4 (D⁴ - d⁴)κ<p>Where κ is the curvature, equal to 1/r.<p>Finally, muddling through the equations on the bending moment article (and treating the tube as a 200&#x27; beam with a load in the center) yields:<p>f = M / (100&#x27;)²/(200&#x27;) [not sure about this one]<p>A whopping 300 tonnes•f of lateral force on the pylons! Probably doable, but it means if your tubes are constructed straight your pylons are going to be buttressed at a ~60° angle. Also, note that this only applies to the slip distance (~150m, or three pylons), since the tube sections well within the curve will never move enough to be in a non-curved section of track, so they can be built curved from the beginning.<p>Also you can vary the curvature smoothly[3], which can substantially reduce the forces involved. For example, if you eased into the curve over 30 pylons and it only moved by 3, the sideways force would be reduced by 10x (since the curvature is always &quot;about right&quot;). Further calculations here are left as an exercise to the interested reader. :D<p>As for my own objection… Even on the sharpest turns successive pylons will only vary from straight line by 0.15°, so the lateral forces caused by expansion and contraction shouldn&#x27;t exceed 9 tonnes force.

A workplace that one wouldn&#x27;t call overtly racist can still have their black employees make less than their white employees for the same work. The phrase that the social justice movement has decided on to call this phenomenon is institutionalized racism. It&#x27;s racism, but no one person or group of people is the culprit, instead it survives because people don&#x27;t care enough to examine how or why they make certain decisions.",1421460518

However, the notion that you could always just reimplement a few places here and there in C is mostly false IMO. In these cases where the interpreter itself is the bottleneck (as opposed to I/O), you&#x27;ll often find that the performance is spread out over dozens or hundreds of sections in your code - for non trivial projects. When that happens and you really need an order of magnitude or more speedup, you basically have to reimplement.<p>What I want to say is: In many cases starting with a scripting language makes sense, just to get a working prototype quickly, but when you know beforehand that performance is critical, don&#x27;t overestimate the ability to just patch it up later.

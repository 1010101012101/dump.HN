8792176,comment,8791370,8791370,0,0,kenOfYugen,,,"My first Apple Computer was a black MacBook 13&quot; bought in 2007. The OS installed was Leopard and I was extremely happy with it.<p>The experience contained quality, responsiveness, stability as well as productivity enhancements. Hadn&#x27;t missed Windows and Linux at all.<p>The experience remained perfect as the OS was gradually getting updates up to 10.6.8, the latest Snow Leopard version and the hard disk drive was changed to a solid state drive.<p>At that time I bought a MacBook Pro 13&quot; with an i5 processor, and was introduced to Lion.<p>Believe it or not, I used my older MacBook more. It &quot;felt&quot; much more solid and responsive. Well at some point I gave it away, and was stuck with the Pro model.<p>As the OS updates where coming along, things were expected to get only better, just like I had previously experienced. But no! I&#x27;m currently using the latest Yosemite, and hate it when I notice tiny buggy things happening..\n[ for example, try to disable the transparency in accessibility features, and get clunky black corner edges around the volume box as you adjust the volume up/down ]<p>As I became a more experienced programmer, I realized that good software is perfect software. Thus anything I notice that&#x27;s not right (and doesn&#x27;t get fixed when it&#x27;s a known issue) is a hint for a lot more bugs that I might never get to experience. So essentially I feel like I&#x27;ve lost the stability and security feelings that used to keep me close to the Mac OS.<p>I really miss Snow Leopard, and hate the path Apple is following. I could bitch about their phones too but that would be more derailing.<p>PS: I wish there was an image out there of Mac OS 10.6.8\nI haven&#x27;t got a spare Apple machine to boot 10.6.7, update it to 10.6.8 and create a bootable disk for my MacBook Pro<p>Does anyone know if such an image exist, or perhaps can create it?",1419411589
8792175,comment,8791370,8791890,0,0,pmjordan,,,"The glass blur effect is actually disabled in VMware and other unaccelerated graphics devices. You can disable it on intel/AMD/nvidia too, the setting is in the accessibility part of system preferences.<p>They&#x27;ve just removed the last remnants of pure 2D acceleration support in Yosemite, it&#x27;s HW-accelerated OpenGL or nothing now. They also changed the timing of screen updates, which locks some drivers at 8FPS. Finally, the rounded corners on windows seem to be broken in the software renderer.<p>Before you go blaming VMWare etc. for not offering an OpenGL driver: Apple doesn&#x27;t document those APIs at all, there aren&#x27;t even headers files. They don&#x27;t even officially support writing a graphics device driver at all (according to DTS), but they provide enough source code so you can figure out how to do so, albeit not providing 3D acceleration.",1419411564

Is there really any significant performance advantage to be had?<p>I really wish normal SSDs just implemented a passthrough mode to the real flash with enough metadata about blocks that the OS can just deal with it directly. Having to implement filesystems on top of these abstractions just seems wrong. We&#x27;re setting us up to later find out that we need to join the two layers like ZFS did with RAID.",1419411546

That transition is <i>not</i> very smooth. Informally, it doesn&#x27;t seem slower ...it&#x27;s just not as smooth as the old effect.<p>As another poster noted, in Yosemite those panels now use a cross-dissolve effect instead the simpler slide and fade in earlier versions of OSX.<p>Thing is, I&#x27;m not sure I would have noticed this in a million years.<p>How much time do you guys spend clicking around in System Preferences every day? This really affects you?<p>I don&#x27;t know of any other apps with preference panes that use this effect. I tried two other apps (iTunes and Pages) and neither one uses the cross dissolve.<p>I understand that this small regression is merely emblematic of the issues some of you are experiencing; none of you are claiming that System Preferences itself has a huge impact on your daily lives.

8792168,comment,8791117,8791989,0,0,sd8f9iu,,,"You make inequality out as the result of purely economic factors, when it is as much the result of political decisions. If congress passes a tax cut for the top 1%, that increases inequality, not because some group has suddenly &quot;found a way to farm more efficiently&quot; or discovered a cure to Alzheimer&#x27;s, but because we decided it that way.<p>And as matthewmacleod has stated, you have constructed a complete straw man for someone against inequality. The inequality movement doesn&#x27;t believe in destroying productive resources. The idea behind redistribution (e.g. taxing the rich and giving it – possibly through increased social spending – to the poor) is to make up for what is seen as an unfair rewarding of wealth and inequality of opportunity. And before you say that this results in the same thing as destroying resources because it drags the economy, I invite you to look into the research being done on the negative economic effects of inequality, not to mention its effect on society as a whole.",1419411377

You either get DRM or copyright, but not both.<p>Finally, I move that corporations can be sued to have their copyright privileges revoked for a period of no less than 50 years if they are caught destroying or interfering with works that should eventually enter the public domain.

8792152,comment,8791117,8791572,0,0,Hermel,,,"In the US, wealth inequality correlates strongly with median age over time. In a regression, raising median age can explain 89% of the raise in wealth inequality of the top 10% (my own calculation, using Picketty data, not online yet). The hypothesis behind this is that inequality tends to grow with age. Among 20 year olds, there is much less inequality than among 60 year olds. In fact, the richest even grow in wealth after retirement thanks to capital gains, widening the gap even more.<p>Maybe the system did not get less fair over the years, just the people older? I would guess that inequality within age groups did not change much over the past 50 years. But those age groups with lots of inequality grew larger.",1419410996

I examined the source code in the GitHub repository and found that all the follow-up operations are immediate. No consideration of or measurement of latency.<p>> I wonder if the experiment normalizes for the client origin.<p>Unfortunately it does not. As you imply, a high round trip time, or just high latency of the storage operations in general, could easily affect the apparent consistency with the current experiment design.<p>In an enhanced version of this experiment I think it would be helpful to have latency measurements, such as total time from beginning of write until end of read (average and percentiles); and as you suggested round trip time measurements. Luckily the code is available, so I suppose it&#x27;s on us to reproduce the results and extend them! Fortunately the code is also pretty short, since a lot of the storage system specific logic is encapsulated within the Apache JClouds library.<p>(To clarify, I don&#x27;t question the accuracy of the results  they are about what I&#x27;d expect.

The approach this site uses is <i>far</i> superior to the flashcard vocab word-driven approach taken by duolingo, memrise and so many others.<p>In my experience, at the beginner level the most important thing is getting a good grasp on phonics and learning some vocabulary. But once a student is even lower intermediate it&#x27;s a way better to spend time doing Extensive Reading instead of vocab drills. Extensive Reading—reading that is easy enough no dictionary is needed—is still great for building vocabulary, and it teaches colocations, grammar and the target language&#x27;s culture, too. As ER builds up vocabulary, more and more radio and podcasts become comprehensible. In the long run, lots and lots of input (both reading and listening) and opportunities to use the language extemporaneously in real life is pretty much assured to lead to full bilingual proficiency.<p>The interesting thing about this app, is it just might allow students to transition from more formal study and into Extensive Reading at an earlier point than they otherwise would. The risk is that students would continue choosing books with a lot of words they don&#x27;t understand and rob themselves of actually &quot;reading&quot; in its natural sense.",1419409365

8792053,comment,8791370,8791370,0,0,Yoshino,,,"I do agree that Yosemite has had some performance regressions, but people seem to remember the older operating systems with rose colored glasses. I used 10.3 to 10.5 on the 2005 PowerBook G4 (1.67 GHz) and it was <i>incredibly</i> slow. Spotlight was nearly useless. The fans would frequently spin up. And let&#x27;s not talk about Finder locking up when a network mount disappeared. Right now I use 10.10 on the original 2012 Retina MBP, and even though Yosemite is a bit slower than Mavericks it is still leagues faster than (Mountain) Lion on the same machine (which is what it shipped with). The biggest performance regressions I&#x27;ve seen have been in Safari, but Chrome doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same problems.<p>I think they are paying attention, since 10.10 performance has improved considerably since the first DP, but they need to do more. I wish they would stop fucking with it on a yearly cycle and just release a stable, fast operating system with no new features. The graphics system needs more optimization and they need to kill HFS+ (but that&#x27;s a whole different can of worms).<p>(Edits: wording)",1419408111

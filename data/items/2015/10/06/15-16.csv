We do not follow the original copy anymore as we have progressed and found different ways to run the country. Additionally, like any text, we can interpret the document differently depending on the bias of who is reading it. The second of three commas in the 2nd amendment makes the amendment have different meanings on who you ask. Pro-gun says the comma seperates the right of the militia and the right to bear arms. Anti-gun says the comma doesn&#x27;t mean anything and only the militia have a right to bear arms.<p>The whole idea of the New Testament which is what Christians follow, is supposed to be an amendment to the Old Testament. The only issue is that there is no copy of the Old Testament with the repealed parts striked out. One could argue that the Old Testament is the book of law but the New Testament is the guidebook on how to follow the law, whats ok to break and whats not.<p>Very rarely do we have situations in life where we have absolute laws and absolute consequences.

And this has to be expanded to every agent in an economy. How will a consumer know how to allocate his resources if the economic is not possible?&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s use the toilet paper example, looking at how this can work in a resource-based economy...<p>&#x27;knowing what to produce&#x27; - toilet paper<p>&#x27;at which quantities&#x27; - at sufficient quantity to meet expected demand, just like in the current system.<p>&#x27;when to invest in capital goods&#x27; - when they are needed<p>&#x27;when to invest in research&#x27; - continuous and free form, no barriers to scientists and engineers researching how to improve the toilet paper that is produced and the methods used to produce it.<p>&#x27;when to save money for the future&#x27; - in a resource-based economy there&#x27;s no money to save.<p>&#x27;this has to be expanded to every agent in an economy&#x27; - everyone who wants toilet paper is invested in seeing production and consumption continue.<p>&#x27;How will a consumer know how to allocate his resources if the economic is not possible?&#x27; - which resources will the consumer need to allocate?<p>&#x27;What you&#x27;re describing is a nightmare world. Guard against over-consumption? Who decides what is considered over-consumption and what is &quot;normal&quot; consumption?&#x27; - In general, you want to encourage consumption by aiming for abundance, through processes such as cradle to cradle design, however you do have to set some limits to stop excessive overconsumption. For example, someone deciding to take all of the toilet paper in the world. However, in general you want to make the limits generous.<p>&#x27;Have you even considered scarcity?&#x27; - Scarcity is an issue, yes. However, you tackle this managing the world&#x27;s resources, aiming to maximise how well we can use them without damaging the ecosystems of the Earth.<p>Would recommend taking a look at this talk on Cradle to Cradle design, gives some practical examples of what is possible when you manage your resources effectively:<p><a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/william_mcdonough_on_cradle_to_cradle_design"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ted.com/talks/william_mcdonough_on_cradle_to_cra...</a><p>It&#x27;s worth mentioning that overpopulation is also a problem. In the case of overpopulation, if the resource limits of the Earth are well understood it&#x27;s easier to know what is the maximum size of human population that the planet can comfortably sustain. Whilst you hope to never have to encounter this limit, you can use policies such as &#x27;one child per couple&#x27; when we need to reign in the size of the population.<p>> &quot;By the way, who produces those smartphones in such a moneyless economy? On what incentive? Who builds the airplanes?&quot;<p>The people produce them because they want to have them. If the resources are available then they can request the item to be made or make their own arrangements to make the item, depending on the complexity of the item in question and the skills needed to create it. For example, a carpenter may want to make a wooden chair by hand, but may want a smartphone to be manufactured by others.<p>> &quot;So the central planner will &quot;just&quot; monitor available resources and then what? Order that more must produced? Whose second/third/etc order goods will be used to produce consumer goods?&quot;<p>Production will be based on demand.<p>> &quot;Do you expect people to invest and innovate in exchange for a rice quota?&quot;<p>Food would be free. All material goods would be free. Innovation would happen because someone wanted to make something better.<p>> &quot;It&#x27;s very easy to just claim &quot;collaboration&quot; and not have to care about how it actually works in practice.&quot;<p>I can explain how it works in practice, but I need to set the scene about the general ideas behind a resource-based economy first.<p>To save some time I&#x27;ll link you to a video that summarises the basic idea. One point I will make beforehand is that I don&#x27;t believe in a &#x27;one world government&#x27; approach aside from the basic fabric of using and protecting resources, which differs from what some other people have proposed. I&#x27;d rather see a diverse group of smaller societies. I also believe in variation in goods produced, which again differs from some approaches. However, we can discuss these details later. Here&#x27;s an introduction to the general ideas of the resource-based economy:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDhSgCsD_x8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDhSgCsD_x8</a>",1444146930

So, websites have to use cookies to display a warning about cookies and if you don&#x27;t accept the cookie, you get a warning about it on every single subsequent visit.<p>It screams laws written by politicians for special interest groups none of whom have the first clue about technology or how it works.<p>You could just have the web browser show an alert when a site wants to set a cookie and the user can click that alert or always allow it.

And they got blind to the warning and paid no attention to it.  Which made any other warning a browser shows more likely to just be clicked through.<p>So browsers removed the warning because we all realized it was stupid and pointless and ineffective and served no purpose any longer.

Understanding that history helps you to understand the mindset of the people who created the technology and why and how they designed it. Understanding that will in turn enable you to appreciate and utilize the strengths and weaknesses of said technology better.<p>One good example: the Unix philosophy. Unix originated back in the 70s, with slow, expensive time-sharing computers, many of which still used printing teletypes. Any text output was expensive in that it used ink and paper and took a long time. Therefore the principle of silence was born: if a program doesn&#x27;t need to say anything, it shouldn&#x27;t. See also the principles of smallness and modularity - each program should do one (and only one) thing well, but it should be easy to combine different programs to suit one&#x27;s needs. You simply couldn&#x27;t run any very large programs back then, and later on it turned out that chaining several together was actually a pretty good design principle anyway. (For more details, see ESR&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Unix Programming&quot;.) Knowing this history will help one appreciate the philosophy, understanding the philosophy will help one write good programs for that context.<p>Second example: take the Python language. Its community places a prime on &quot;pythonicness&quot; (<a href=""http://blog.startifact.com/posts/older/what-is-pythonic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.startifact.com/posts/older/what-is-pythonic.html</a>), a set of guidelines/rules/principles that strongly influence the evolution of the language. Knowing what is and what is not pythonic helps one write better, cleaner Python code, as it enables one to use the language as it is intended.<p>tl;dr: knowing the history and culture surrounding a technology enables you to use it as it was intended",1444145353

They began at $31.36 an ounce.  The next morning this increased to $31.54, then $31.76 and $31.82.  No one had a clue how they went about setting the price, although everyone presumed that some subtle analyses of the world bullion and foreign exchange markets went into the calculations.  In fact, the choice of price was completely random.  All they were trying to do was to push the price a little higher than the day before.  The exercise brought out the juvenile in Roosevelt.

If you&#x27;re saying that it&#x27;s going to be terrible to make changes to your codebase, simply bolting micro services on top of that is going to make things worse.<p>A well-designed micro service architecture is modular in that each micro service is basically a nice wrapper around either a query or an update.

They&#x27;re fully rational and logical, but from the external view, terrible.  These choices may be grounded in emotional or intellectual &quot;idiosyncrasies&quot;, but you can&#x27;t quite call them medical, and the &quot;oh that poor dear&quot; narrative isn&#x27;t helpful.  You can treat illness, but you can&#x27;t treat worldview and behavior.<p>The other problem with this train of thought is that then, other &quot;amoral&quot; choices become medical.  For instance, when many believed homosexuality was a terrible horrible amoral sin, there was a push to consider it a &quot;disorder&quot; (with the complicity of the psychological community), which merited psychological or other medical interventions.  This lead to the idea of &quot;conversion therapy&quot;, because an &quot;illness&quot; can usually be &quot;cured&quot;.  Similar views have been proposed for other socially unacceptable behaviors, and later discredited when the wider moral viewpoint shifted.<p>When this decade&#x27;s &quot;morality&quot; crisis is treated as medical, you open the door to medical (mis)treatment of anything society doesn&#x27;t care for, and that&#x27;s, in many ways, worse than the current approaches.  You can release somebody from jail when we realize a law is stupid, but 10 years of Psychiatry&#x27;s Favorite Hot New Substance in a small padded room runs the risk of depriving people of far more than just time.<p>I agree that the motive of the legal system should be less about revenge, but a &quot;people who do bad things are all mentally ill&quot; narrative doesn&#x27;t fix that. If done poorly, it mostly means that people doing things we don&#x27;t like will spend their lives drugged out of their heads in padded rooms, rather than sober in concrete ones.<p>So, we need to keep a strong line between &quot;people making bad choices&quot; (which requires behavioral interventions) and &quot;people unable to make choices in reality&quot; (which requires medical or psychiatric ones).  These are two different situations, and as our current system proves, neither intervention suffices for both.",1444144723

Timeout.com had spent several years using the PHP framework Symfony to build a massive monolithic CMS, and the thing was a disaster. It was shockingly slow. If you ssh&#x27;ed to inside the datacenter and then tested the response time of the system, under ideal conditions, from one computer in the data center to another computer in the data center, then the average response time was 10 seconds!<p>This lead to a long internal debate. I advocated for what I called &quot;An architecture of small apps&quot;, because at that time none of us had ever heard the word &quot;microservices&quot;.

But the bigger thing standing in the way of a solution is the belief of most people, which is rarely even thinly veiled, that most criminals deserve whatever they get.<p>Which is understandable: many times (most of the time?) the criminal has actually done something heinous, and I suspect we&#x27;re programmed to depersonalize and even hate people who commit asocial crimes. But it does lead to barbaric results that a civilized society should reject.<p>ETA: Just to be explicit that there are ways to make the experience of prisons better: don&#x27;t charge a prisoner $20 for a 15 minute phone call.

There is no way a normal person can reasonably protect themselves from an attack like this targeted personally.<p>I disagree. Protection of yourself is a multi-angle approach.<p>One of the very practical ways to not live in fear of evil strangers is to practice good online anonimity, pseudonymity and/or compartmentalisation.<p>Back when I first got regular Internet access in 1998, this was a no-brainer. Almost everybody did it, and even if you slipped up at first, it was often possible to just cover some tracks and start over with a new nickname.<p>I walked the web like that for years, until modern Internet made it a lot harder. I was forced to make some hard choices about my own privacy (and thereby automatically about other people&#x27;s privacy too) versus the ability to stay in contact with certain (groups of) friends. Not for one-to-one messages, email still works fine for that in principle, and everybody still uses it. It&#x27;s the <i>group</i> communications that were the real issue, forcing very hard choices on people that actually want to choose privacy. But I digress.<p>The point is, simple precautions like this used to be no harder than simple real-life precautions such as locking your door and not leaving your phone or wallet on the bar counter as you go to the toilet. Simple common-sense things such as not writing your street address on your key-chain label. Or in cases of &quot;bad luck&quot;, if some creepy guy is being creepy, being able to safely tell the bartender, paying attention that he doesn&#x27;t see where you&#x27;re going as you leave, letting a trusted friend know where you are, etc.<p>No it doesn&#x27;t offer 100% protection, but it helps a lot! Real-life precautions like the above are the &quot;way a normal person can <i>reasonably</i> protect themselves&quot; from these types of real-life attacks and threats.<p>Nobody, corporation or government, would consider making such real-life precautions harder to follow. Or if a corporation would leverage network-effect to turn such a real-life precaution into a social handicap or taboo, people would quickly ask themselves &quot;wait, is this  really what we want?&quot;, and as soon as the first victims fell, the corp would get a lot of flak for it.<p>I believe we should allow people to be able to afford the same sorts of easy-to-follow <i>on line</i> precautions, without forcing people to make the awkward choice between privacy (and sometimes safety) and partaking in social life without too much inconvenience to themselves, and importantly, their friends too.",1444144463

Entrenched privilege and the resultant increase in inequality is quite a divisive issue already; a putative future in which this aspect of society is further extended such that children of the wealthy are unassailably genetically superior will be unacceptable to many.<p>My point is not that genetic manipulation is wrong – in fact, I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s inevitable and essentially the next stage in human evolution.

Windows mobile users had all these features and more for a long time already. It seemed like the only new thing about the iPhone was the UI and UX. Purely technically it had much less features. Thus most windows mobile power users just couldn&#x27;t get excited about it. What we all underestimated is how much of a game changer the iOS UX was for market adoption. No average person wanted a &quot;PDA&quot;, most people probably didn&#x27;t even know much about these devices. It was something used by tech-savy business people.\nThat irrelevancy of WM PDAs made it seem like iPhone was the very first to have all these features. And it indeed was the first device to bring that to the mainstream and led the whole mobile revolution. \nIn retrospect it&#x27;s so painfully obvious, but at the time it did really seem like a nice toy to most smart people. And one has to remember at the time UX wasn&#x27;t as appreciated. iPhone pretty much started the UX revolution as well.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as simple as making the wrong assumptions. It&#x27;s more about being unable to see the future and how much a few simple things can change the industry.<p>Like lol, even a few years in I still got the HTC TyTN II and couldn&#x27;t care less about iPhones or the new Android at the time.

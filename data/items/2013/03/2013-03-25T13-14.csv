If you've never been out of your urban area, ever, perhaps a native New Yorker or something like that, you may not realize that trees can be found all over the world in some pretty crazy conditions.  Not just trees, but even human beings, have been known to live in places that are 26 degrees warmer (or colder), although someone extremely unsophisticated may not be aware of it.  Which made me interpret the article as a humor piece.<p>What could be a problem is placing a skyscraper in an area already only borderline habitable, but why would you want to live there anyway?  The treeline in colorado is around eleven or twelve thousand feet so given that Denver is about five thousand feet up, I would not put a tree covered skyscraper more than 5000 or so feet higher than Denver.  Or if you're building in Denver and insist on putting a tree on top, don't make the building more than 6000 feet tall.  Or if you're building a little hut at Mt Everest base camp, putting a tree on top of it might not work out so well.  Another issue is the absolute tree line for all conifers might be 11000 feet but for say, palm trees, it might be lower.",1364219708

5436912,comment,5434627,5435711,2,0,tomku,,,"If you spend a lot of time making a good deck full of programming language facts, I'm sure that it works well enough.  I don't think that it's any kind of substitute for sitting down and coding.  I think that the core issue is that there are a lot of things you CAN memorize in order to make coding easier, but there are very few things that you MUST memorize in order to make coding possible.  No matter how much you memorize, you're still going to end up sitting down to code and learning from your mistakes.<p>That said, if you want to give it a shot, I'd suggest starting with the desktop version of Anki.  Make your own deck, because making a deck is its own form of studying.  Use it for a while, and if you feel that it's something that you want to invest more time in, get the mobile app.<p>Oh, one other thing I'd like to mention about SRS.  SRS techniques are designed to manage HUGE numbers of cards, ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands.  If you have less than a hundred or so cards, it's just a really smart flash card system - you could review all the cards every couple days without much trouble.  People who really get into SRS tend to use it for everything, because it's an easy way to integrate more knowledge into their existing knowledge-management framework.  As such, you should be careful about recommendations for using it for one particular field.  The people doing the recommending usually have lower friction regarding adding a couple hundred programming cards to their deck than you will as a beginner.",1364219318

5436905,comment,5436316,5436316,3,0,ShellfishMeme,,,"I honestly don't feel like any of the ""large scale (JS|Backbone) applications"" posts really addresses the difficulties you run into when scaling JS applications.  
Most of these things are common sense (eg. ""use namespaces"", ""make use of consistent naming conventions"" etc.) and should hold for any kind of application development.<p>For me, one of the main problems when scaling the Backbone app I work with is decoupling View interactions. Now the usual recommendation you receive is using an event bus. In the link @analog just posted [1], Addy Osmani talks about using the Mediator pattern to achieve the decoupling, which certainly does help, but imho his example does not fully reflect the purpose of the Mediator pattern. His Mediator is barely more than just an event bus.<p>A Mediator can make use of an event bus, but an event bus is not automatically a mediator.  
It still forces the views to know about events triggered from other views and react to them. This still causes coupling, and even worse, it keeps the coupling in the views. The mediator should exist to take care of that coupling and pull it out of the views.<p>Let's take for example a checkout page. The checkout page has a view containing a form for address data. It also has a view that lets you pick the payment provider, a view that allows you to enter a coupon and a view that shows the order total.<p>Here are some of the required view-to-view interactions:<p>* If the user email changed, revalidate the coupon to make sure the ""new users only"" constraint applies and show the status<p>* If the payment type is changed to Paypal, add an additional charge to the order total and display it.<p>* If a coupon is entered, update the order total<p>This means that in many cases, views need to know exactly how the public event interfaces of the other views look, even if they communicate by an event bus and not by direct references and method calls. To make the application maintainable, we need to get rid of the knowledge about the other views' events as well.<p>This is where the Mediator comes into play. We make the mediator aware of the different event interfaces of the Views and have it decide which events to retrigger or which methods to call in what View. Instead of having the views subscribe to the other Views' events, the Mediator wires them up and encapsulates the View interactions. 
The Mediator now knows that the `change:email` event from the AddressForm triggers the `validateCoupon` method on the CouponView or the `validate:coupon` event to which the CouponView listens. The CouponView no longer needs to know about the existence of the `change:email` event.<p>Now the Views only need to specify their public (event) interfaces and the Mediator knows about how the different Views interact. This is a lot more scalable than the naive event bus approach.<p>I really wish there were more articles about scaling really big JS applications. In the end they will probably heavily borrow from GoF's Design Patterns book, but it always helps to see the patterns in action. I appreciate the author's effort, but I always feel disappointed when I read ""Large Scale (Backbone|JS) Applications"" and don't find advice to solve and real problems what come up with scaling ""Large Scale (Backbone|JS) Applications"".<p>[1] <a href=""http://addyosmani.com/largescalejavascript/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://addyosmani.com/largescalejavascript/</a>",1364219215

The main issue is that for the most part, the protocol assumes that information provided by another source is correct. This could clearly be used mallisiously, but it also allows small, innocent mistakes to take down the network.<p>For example, back in 2008, Pakistan decided to block youtube within their country. While this specific example would not happen in a utopian society, there could be valid reasons that a sub-network would want to disable or redirect requests going to a different server.<p>What happened was that one of the ISPs, instead of simply blocking outgoing requests to youtube, advertised itself as youtube. This change propogated through the network, and youtube went down globally.<p>Still, when these issues do come up without any malice, they should be relatively easy and painless to fix.",1364219209

He <i>wrote about</i> Fascist societies, but reading both his fiction and his nonfiction does not generally lead to the conclusion that he considered this desirable or stable.<p>I think the people who get that he's a fascist are making the mistake of assuming that because an author writes about it, they are endorsing it. This obviously falls apart under any sort of thought whatsoever, but that's more thought than most people give it. Alternatively, they get it from the Starship Troopers <i>movie</i>, in which IMHO the director misread Heinlein as a fascist, leading everyone else to the same conclusion by the nose. This is not the best source from which to conclude anything about Heinlein; I think it was a good movie on its own merits but little of Heinlein's politics shown through.<p>In N-Space, Larry Niven directly addresses another example of this; Jerry Pournelle's Co-Dominion future, in which their co-written A Mote in God's Eye takes place, is set in a galactic empire consciously set up to be feudalistic, including starting from a fairly idealistic conception of feudalism where obligations are bi-directional, and decaying (in the sequel) into the sort of feudalism where the nobles begin to consider their privileges their right without any corresponding responsibility. Neither author is <i>endorsing</i> this political structure, <i>per se</i>, but observing the course of human history, one can not deny that under the right circumstances feudalism could very well rise again, and it can work well for a story.",1364218289

If by ""homophobe"" you mean someone who literally fears that social acceptance of gay marriage, related causes, and homosexuality in general is likely to undermine the vitality (and virtue) of America, then yes.<p>But do realize that the guy treats homosexual <i>people</i> with similar levels of dignity and respect as any other human being, at least in the likes of his writing. If you doubt this and wish to see examples in his literature, please read his novel _Songmaster_ - a novel which caught Card a lot of flak from conservative groups who accused it of glorifying homosexuality.<p>(If you still doubt this afterwards, well, okay, maybe it won't convince everyone, but you'll be much better informed about the nature of the problem and your opinion will have nuance).<p>Anyway. For what it's worth, I'm sure a lot of interesting authors like C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkein, and many of their less obvious contemporaries would find themselves in a non-dissimilar position if the issue were one in their times - as would a variety of Christian groups opposing gay marriage and similar causes today.<p>For this reason I find the outcome of the recent Card/Superman hullabaloo disappointing and distressing. It is nigh unto unthinkable that you would actual find any representation in a Card-authored Superman comic which would be anything less than perfectly charitable towards homosexuals - and more likely he would just steer clear of stuffing modern sociopolitical controversies into it. (And it's nice to escape those once in a while, you know? like in <i>comics</i> and stuff. :P)<p>DISCLAIMER.

The book could very well be a Poe story the way it's written. Every word is chosen for the final effect. All the character's development and what he does is preparation for that crucial moment in the story, pretty much like ""The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar"". You could even remove the ending and it would still be an awesome story.<p>And then when I thought about the movie the first thing that came to mind was all the possibilities for visual effects in the battle room. And now the first thing I see from the director is mentions of the battle room. So, are two hours of visual effects enough to build up the climax of the story? Will they split the novel in two to be able to do it in the second film? I sincerely hope they manage to get it right.",1364217507

My first response is to say that I find it both possible and desirable. My second is to note that ""elimination of mutable state"" isn't really the goal.<p>The real goal is to give mutable state a very composable, repeatable, clear, and restricted semantics. This is what occurs in the State monad in Haskell, for instance. You retain mutability (observable w.r.t. the stored state over applications) but can slice up the mutation and the intermediate, immutable values and recompose them in various forms with impunity.<p>That kind of state model is incredible to learn. Monads might be scary because they're unfamiliar, but in a functional context they can do some beautiful things.",1364217279

67059,comment,66842,67040,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Risk mitigation.  Most large tech companies don't purchase startups for the revenue they bring in.  They purchase them because they are <i>deathly</i> afraid that some startup will become the next big thing that renders their revenue stream obsolete.  It's happened often enough that big companies have reason to be concerned: think of how the computer world would look different if IBM had bought Microsoft instead of licensing their software, or if Yahoo had bought Google when it was an early-stage startup.<p>If you look at the > $1B acquisitions, almost all (except Skype) have been for companies that fundamentally threaten a large company's business model.  If Google hadn't bought YouTube, Viacom's lawsuit against it might have set a precedent that literally puts Google out of business.  If EBay hadn't bought PayPal, it would've opened the door to a payment service that wasn't controlled by Ebay yet was frequented by all of EBay's customers; it's not a huge leap for Paypal to start offering its own listings then.<p>Startup founders have the opposite risk profile: their wealth is all tied up in one company, so if they <i>don't</i> take over the big company's market, they get nothing.  Most founders would rather take their $40M payout and diversify.<p>So basically it comes down to risk aversion.  Say that a startup has a 1% chance of displacing the big company (worth $100B for the sake of argumentation), and a 99% chance of eventually failing.  For a big company, 1% is far too large a chance of losing everything, particularly when they have the cash & stock to avert the possibility entirely.  For a founder, $1B is a helluva lot of money, and far better than a 1% chance at being the richest man in the world yet a 99% chance of nothing.<p>There's also a moral hazard issue, in that the people actually responsible for footing the bill are stockholders, yet the company executives have a far stronger incentive to not look bad by botching an acquisition than to save $1B.  Many money managers <i>hate</i> acquisitions, because it's by far the favorite way to destroy shareholder value.  But few CEOs will be replaced for making too many acquisitions, while it's almost guaranteed that they will be replaced if they <i>fail</i> to make the acquisition that becomes a major competitor.<p>A pithy way to put it might be ""Big companies are driven by fear, yet startups are driven by greed.""  That gives both of them incentives to agree on an acquisition price higher than fair market value.",1192228612

I&#x27;m glad that Armin&#x27;s giving it the coverage it deserves, but there&#x27;s a little more to the story here both for and against the notion of unwinding.<p><i>For</i>: for some domains, you really, really, really want to be able to handle panics. For a notable example, one of the first production deployments of Rust is a Ruby gem that runs inside of a client&#x27;s Rails process (<a href=""https://www.skylight.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.skylight.io/</a>). Without the ability to unwind, a panic in your Rust code would bring down the whole process (henceforth an &quot;abort&quot;), and your paying customers will probably be somewhat peeved. Servo is also looking to leverage unwinding, so that a panic in one tab doesn&#x27;t abort the entire browser process.<p><i>Against</i>: the concept of unwinding is inherently flawed in some very pernicious ways. Say you&#x27;re the user in the previous paragraph who <i>needs</i> to catch panics. You have everything set up properly, and when your code panics you&#x27;re prepared: the stack unwinds, freeing resources and calling destructors. Everything is peachy. But here&#x27;s a twist: while unwinding, what happens if one of your destructors panics? The process aborts, is what happens. You&#x27;ve setup all this machinery for apparently nothing at all. And generating all the machinery for unwinding is a hit to compile time, bloats binary sizes, and can potentially thwart optimizations in the generated code.<p>I don&#x27;t think it would be uncontroversial to provide unwinding as an option. The biggest question here is whether or not that option would be enabled or disabled by default, as it would have implications for distributing compiled binaries (though perhaps Cargo could assist with this).",1414720784

8536912,comment,8534489,8536667,0,0,wahern,,,"You don&#x27;t have to instrument every single arithmetic operation. Multiplicative overflow can only happens if the value of one or the other operand is >= 2^(N/1), where N is the number of value bits.<p>On 64-bit machines, this means if you use 32-bit values and properly promote them, or one 32-bit value and one 64-bit value, you don&#x27;t have to instrument.<p>Also, often times the better strategy is to design your code to be immune to overflow. Garbage-in is garbage-out, so if somebody gives you garbage then they can expect to get garbage out. All that matters is that you don&#x27;t allow that garbage to taint the state of your program. I usually use unsigned arithmetic, because then I don&#x27;t need to worry about undefined behavior in C. And for general bounds checking tasks my only condition is whether something is >= object-size.<p>Some of us rigorously analyze our code for overflow problems.<p>Those of you who don&#x27;t are like the programmers from 20 years ago who thought that it was too tedious to do bounds checking on buffers, and that because of all the existing code it wouldn&#x27;t improve security.<p>Well it did matter. Like with buffer overflows, it&#x27;s a collective action problem. The dilemma you point out doesn&#x27;t exist if you stop being so resistant to change.",1414720329

language, for both vocabulary and appropriate
usage of the words, was from learning phrases
and not individual words one at a time.  Or,
to learn several words, it&#x27;s much easier to 
learn a phrase that uses those words than just
the words themselves.  And learning the phrases
lets you start to <i>think</i> in the new language
and not keep going back via 1-1 word to word
from your own language to the foreign one.<p>One way to learn a lot of those phrases is to
have a little story with maybe 20 such sentences
and then read the story out loud maybe 20
times a day for a few days.  Then practice 
making the sounds correct via use of language
lab where hear a recording of a native speaker
reading the story and, then, correcting your
reading of the story.<p>Can learn a lot of a foreign language that way,
quickly.<p>So, this approach is radical:  Start with reading
and speaking and leave writing and grammar until
later, say, after have already learned a lot of
phrases.  Or, in English, how does one learn
I am, you are, he is, we are, you are, they are?
Sure, not by memorizing such a table but by
lots of phrases that are examples of the content
of such a table.  Then, when have lots of good
examples, learn the rules later.",1414719163

While one might argue that the court could easily rule for the government in this case given that the defendant consented to the secondary search (perhaps out of ignorance of the law), what&#x27;s troubling for me in this related case is the government&#x27;s position outright: namely, that it doesn&#x27;t matter if the police officer does or does not know the law as long as a stop is &quot;reasonable.&quot; To me that sounds like a pretty awful precedent to set.

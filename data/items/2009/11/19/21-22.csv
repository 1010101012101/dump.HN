951205,comment,950751,951149,0,0,ams6110,,,"Here's my guess about Apple's thinking.  Note that I don't own an iPhone or iTouch.  So I don't have any experience with the App Store or submitting applications to it, and can't say that it is or is not working this way but....<p>Apple wants iPhone apps to ""just work""  They don't want a plethora of buggy, half-baked, inconsistent apps in their store, because this would diminish the brand.  It would be like a typical Linux distribution where half the apps implement their own peculiar UI conventions, crash often, or just don't work at all.<p>So it <i>is</i> like developing a game.  You get one release, one chance, to get it right.  It needs to work.  Maybe a lot of app developers don't get this.  There are published standards about conventions, icons, behavior, etc.  The app is expected to be FINISHED and WORKING before you submit it to the store.  Don't count on deploying 27 follow up patches and updates to customers -- imagine the chaos if every iPhone app needed updates multiple times.  Users (most of whom are not hackers) would, after a while, just give up and abandon the platform.<p>So, when an app is submitted, it is reviewed, and if it's found to be buggy, or it doesn't work, or it works in an unconventional way, then they don't want it.  And they're not in a particular hurry to waste more time on you when you didn't follow the instructions the first time.<p>I don't know, I'm just speculating.

951195,comment,950751,951012,0,0,mlinsey,,,"I think you may be right, but I have a couple misgivings.<p>The year that iPhone existed without the App Store, no smartphone competitors came close to replicating it's core functionality and user experience.  I don't think that's  quite true anymore, and so I think that the App Store is one of the iPhone's key advantages. Specifically, the iPhone didn't need the App Store to differentiate itself from RIM and WinMo in 2007, but I think it absolutely needs the App Store to differentiate itself from the Pre and Android in 2009.<p>I don't think there is one killer 3rd-party app on the phone that everyone needs to have, but there could very well be many third party apps that smaller niches need to have.  For me personally, MLB At-Bat (live streaming of baseball games) and the Kindle reader are actually the two biggest factors keeping me from switching to Droid. Those applications could easily be ported to Android, but haven't been yet, and in both cases a third party holds the distribution rights for the content so it's not like me or another hacker could replicate those apps easily.",1258667058

951149,comment,950751,951012,0,0,shiro,,,"I too noticed the similarity to the console game development.  Usually console game developers have to go through lengthy approval process of the platform provider.  Still developers accept that (although grudgingly), since once approved and the released, that will be the end of the process; no more bug fixes; the team dissolves and everybody starts working on the next project.  (PC games are different, and certainly network games are continuous development, but console games have this feeling of ""done is done"").<p>Part of it may be a byproduct of the way the console games distributed on ROMs or disks.  That may change, for consoles nowadays have network connection and can get updates anytime.   There's another part, however, that some type of games fits this ""done is done"" philosophy.  Like novels or movies, which you don't expect them to be improved over time.<p>Well, I don't defend the app store process either, and I believe majority of software should be developed in the iterative process.

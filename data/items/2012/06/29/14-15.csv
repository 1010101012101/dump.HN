It is less personally offensive as the ""person to blame"" field and still gets to the same analytic data for reviews.<p>I do agree a ""person to blame"" field was obviously implemented by a ""management only"" oriented person to probably cover his/her own ass. Essentially this is a scorecard to give to his higher-ups to say ""Hey look Bob is the one with all the issues, no me"".",1340981983
4176909,comment,4176658,4176658,19,0,Spooky23,,,"I was a senior manager in an organization where one of my peers essentially inserted a similar blame regime into our incident management process. It is a poisonous practice, but I actually loved my job and wanted to improve the place. So my team fought back.<p>The way that you defeat a system like this is to use it. Be humble, honest and calm, and go out of your way take the hits. But refuse to be blamed for things that aren't your responsibility. Force the problem people to do the same.<p>That undermines the system, as your putting the problem person in the uncomfortable position of taking responsibility for his actions. The whole point of ""blame assignment"" is to deflect blame from the golden children.<p>In my case, the blame regime lasted a few months. It collapses when the person pushing the regime is on the defensive too often.",1340981976

4176905,comment,4176658,4176658,54,0,reitzensteinm,,,"The top answer has it exactly right. This should be Root Cause, since ultimately even bugs caused by human errors are really caused by systemic flaws. Some examples:<p><pre><code>  * SQLite has 1177 times as many tests as code (not a typo)\n  * Live television is broadcast with a 5-10 second delay\n  * IMVU automatically reverts commits pushed to the site if regressions are detected\n  * Netflix implemented a system called the Chaos Monkey, which randomly shuts \n    down processes. Ensures the system can survive any failure\n  * VLC, Unity3D, Windows, 3D Studio Max and many more applications phone\n    home crashes, which allows developers to quickly patch frequent issues\n  * Code reviews and pair programming ensure no one person's mistake\n    can break critical code sections\n  * Similarly, multiple people should sign off on copy written. For newsletters\n    and press releases the whole team should, since they can't be withdrawn\n  * Well designed systems automatically backup, and those backups are \n    automatically tested, so nothing is deleted forever\n</code></pre>\nChange ""who"" to ""why"" and a horrible idea turns into a brilliant one. Well designed systems can reduce the risk of almost any mistake, at the cost of speed and flexibility.<p>Ultimately it's up to the company to decide where the balance lies, and to live with the consequences. Startups will accept a drastically different risk profile to banks and Fortune 500 companies.",1340981889

4176891,comment,4175399,4176694,4,0,talmand,,,"But what exactly are you basing the accusation of a horrible user experience on? Is it a matter of a Flash app that's badly designed? Because that's not Adobe's fault. If one were to duplicate the app's horrible user experience over to iOS does that mean the user experience for iOS apps can be considered as horrible? If I write some bad javascript that causes the browser to consistently crash does that mean that javascript or even the browser sucks?<p>Lack of Flash on iOS is a feature for you. Let's not assume what's good for you must be good for everyone else. I for one have never had much of a problem with Flash on the hardware that I use, but in some circles a negative opinion always outweighs a positive one.<p>The complaints about the problems you describe just running the Flash player on several different platforms are rather well deserved. It does seem that Adobe has decided at some point to drop the ball on the whole thing. But the player does support backwards compatibility all the way back to the beginning. I've always thought that possibly the majority of their problems relate to that. They should try just ripping out support for anything that uses versions less than actionscript 3 for a leaner plugin.<p>But, this statement does seem more about the Flash player itself in the browser. It doesn't necessarily mean that Flash, as in the platform, will die. It'll probably live on as its own platform that requires something like Adobe Air to run on some hardware.<p>Also, almost everything you hate about Flash's ""user experience"" will live on in the canvas tag.

4176867,comment,4176301,4176510,4,0,p2e,,,"I think that this is a serious issue.  Khan usually just hits record once, publishes, and never revisits his videos again.  By his own admission, he takes some initial feedback (first few video comments) from his videos but only applies it to his subsequent lessons not bothering to fix the prior lessons.  This allows him to produce a lot of content, but it can end up doing more harm than good by keeping a lot of bad lessons out there.<p>I've seen quite a few of his videos that have had serious problems in them, 20-second long stretches of silence when he's erasing or fixing mistakes, and places where he talks himself (and the listener) into a circle.  I just don't see why Khan doesn't take the time to fix obvious mistakes/issues in his videos -- or have someone else do it!  Sure, it means more video development time but it's for the purpose of producing superior lessons and not spreading misinformation.<p>Traditional educators revisit topics/lessons and learn from their previous attempts and from student feedback.  This allows future lessons on the same topic to be more refined and better serve the student.  Who honestly believes they get something right the first time, or doesn't try to improve something when they, or someone else, identifies an obvious problem?<p>Khan has an excellent framework in place, but he needs to revisit his content.

Obviously, now it's all cleared up and back to normal, but my God, those of us on the normal credit scale are clueless as to how expensive bad credit is.<p>EVERYTHING costs more when you have bad credit.  You are perceived to be a risk, and that risk is priced into anything that involves a long term commitment of payment.  Move?  You will pay a higher rent at some places, or simply a higher security deposit.  Activating utilities?  The power or water company will want a few hundred dollars down.

Our punishment for that success was that management saw this general-purpose mail reader and said, ""since this mail reader is popular with normal people, we must now pimp it out to 'The Enterprise', call it Groupware, and try to compete with Lotus Notes!""<p>To do this, they bought a company called Collabra who had tried (and, mostly, failed) to do something similar to what we had accomplished. They bought this company and spliced 4 layers of management in above us.

This is how I got started programming in the mid-to-late 90's as a kid in high school.<p>There was some auction software written in PHP, and I setup an auction site and spent tons of nights making small tweaks to the software to make it a really cool and fully-featured auction site. Nobody listed a damn thing on the site, of course, but I was hooked.<p>- Bad habits can be unlearned (I've unlearned enough to know)<p>- You can go back and learn CS basics<p>- You can gain an appreciation for well-designed languages and tradeoffs in design<p>But it is really, really hard to replicate that awesome feeling when you start out with some substantial piece of software and are able to incrementally make it better - making bigger and bigger changes as you learn more and become confident. The fact that so much open-source PHP software exists, the development cycle is so short, and it is so quick and easy to host makes it pretty good for that. Honestly, as much as I like Java now, if I'd started out trying to use it, who knows what I'd be doing now.<p>As crappy as the language is, it is good enough at a lot of things. You won't ""kill"" PHP by making a better language any more than you would beat CraigsList by designing a better UI.",1340981228

Alas, it is at the bottom of what is basically another of the ""PHP sucks"" posts, of which he says we already have too many.  And now this comment thread is hip-deep in ""Shut up, PHP works fine"" posts.<p>I'm self-taught on Python, and I love it, but as I've moved freelance I've had to learn PHP, and I . . . don't love it.  It is what many of my clients use, for reasons that seem good to them, so there you go.  I don' enjoy learning it and using it the way I enjoy Python, but as a professional that's Just Too Damn Bad.  So I'm kind of with the people irritated by the PHP bitching.<p>But I wish that Python had those characteristics that make PHP ubiquitous.  I'm too new to really state what these are, and I imagine there are some good design reasons for avoiding some of those patterns.  But anyone preferring that something like Python or Ruby should see wider adoption has to consider the aspects of PHP that have supported its prevalence, and compete on those aspects.<p>I am going to guess that Jeff felt the need to critique PHP because he thought there must be some justification for duplicating those functionalities of PHP.  I think the community is at a consensus that there isn't, and shouldn't / couldn't be, One True Language, and that it's okay to choose the proper tool for a particular job.  And if that's the case, why would it make sense to revise Python or Ruby to duplicate stuff that's already done well by PHP?  Why insist that any one language do everything?  The best  argument would be that PHP gets a lot right, but couples that to a lot it gets wrong.  And whether or not that is so drives the question of whether some other language should trouble itself to duplicate the stuff PHP gets right.<p>It might be enough to say that some people / many people don't like PHP very much and wish that other tools were more prevalent.  Among such people, the questions then are: 1) are we just being jerks, is there really that much to be gained by getting away from PHP? and 2) how do other languages have to change (technically, the installed base / trained developer population arguments are beyond this discussion) to compete?  And I think the two questions are related.  If it isn't hard to make Python as deployable as PHP, then we needn't gain much to make it worthwhile.  But if those changes are hard, or they somehow introduce into Python anti-patterns of some kind, or shift the community focus in some negative way, then we would have to see much larger gains to make the shift worthwhile.<p>I hope Jeff reviews the reaction to this and responds with another post, one that explores why PHP is so frequently adopted.  (Again, it's best to put to one side the issues of widespread developer knowledge and default configuration in support of it, if a better alternative is built those things will move.)  And, what are the challenges of adapting Python / Ruby / Perl to competing on those technical aspects?  And what are the technical / community risks of making those adaptations?  At that point I think he's moving the discussion in a much more constructive direction.",1340980540

The fact that the AoT compiler uses C++ as a target doesn't change the input language, which really is PHP. E.g., $i = 0; $a[$i] = $i++; makes a different array than $i = 0; $a[$i + 0] = $i++;. We have to get all the nooks and crannies right because we use significant open source packages in PHP.<p>The developer's usual routine is the same as someone using Zend; they write honest-to-goodness PHP and reload the page. There is no compilation involved; you instead are using the JIT (or until recently, an interpreter) that monitors the filesystem for changes and silently integrates them.<p>Facebook devs use PHP exactly as everybody else does; they just do so with a different toolchain.",1340979897

I think PHP is a generally awful language, eclipsed in sheer programming linguistic badness only by such systems as MUMPS (which, fortunately, I have never had the opportunity to work with). Fractal of bad? Check.<p>And it isn't just a bad programmer thing. PHP's bad habits encourage novice (or uncaring) programmers to pick up bad habits, especially if they are not particularly inclined to study how to use their tools well. Given a language where the obvious thing to do is right vs. one where it's wrong (see PHP < 5 database queries - no prepared statements, mysql_escape_string) vs. an environment where the obvious thing, encouraged by the introductory tutorials, is right, I think that the more correct/safer language will encourage programmers to write better code.<p>But reading the comments here and on Jeff's post, it is humbling to remember that people are using it, every day, to build more and better software than I ever have.

We've now got a new business model and are kicking ass and taking names. :) And even though the program has ended, our mentors are still involved.<p>Pitch Day was great. They spent a lot of time the last couple of weeks really helping us refine our pitch -- ended up with a couple of solid pitches. One more of a story meant to generate excitement and another rooted more in the market and financials -- all the details that an investor would be looking for.<p>Not sure how many people showed up, but there had to have been 200 or more people -- at least, that's what it felt like up on the stage giving our pitch. We're now busy following up with potential investors and executing our new business plan. Crazy, hectic times. And we get to squat at the American Tobacco Campus in the TSF digs at least until the new class arrives.<p>Their application for the Fall class is tomorrow. You don't have to be located in the Triangle to get in -- at least one of the companies (Berst) was from Chicago and I know several of us had people living and working from other places in the country.<p>Happy to answer any questions about the program for those considering applying.

Even if the guy that delivers the iPads to the table doubles as a waiter, won't it still be difficult to feel pampered and waited on?<p>After all, when we dine in expensive restaurants, we expect a certain experience, quality and selection of food, but above all a knowlegeable guide who tell us about everything about the food and wine (highly subjective). When we then need to interface with iPads to learn about the menu and place orders, we lose that human interaction that makes visiting places so much fun (for me anyway).<p>On the flip side, you can place a drink order without needing to wait and flag down your order, and perhaps get your food faster... assuming of course that 15 tables didn't all submit their orders at once.",1275724348

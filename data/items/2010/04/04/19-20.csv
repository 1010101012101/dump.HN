Adding multitasking like the Android means every user becomes an accountant keeping track of what's running and what should be killed. Activity or task managers are most definitely not intuitive. Most apps don't have any business running in the background, saving and resuming states seems to work in most cases especially with smart use of push notifications.<p>I've really only seen a couple compelling use cases and that is Pandora (basically music running in the background for the uninitiated) and the YC Wakemate app. Anyone have any others that couldn't be solved with push?",1270411149

It's from an era when it was popular to try to make programming languages look like English. Most people have since decided that trying to make code look like English text is a Bad Thing.<p>Second, it is very common to create SQL queries by splicing together strings in whatever language you're using for the rest of the application. That's a horrible way to write any kind of code. ORM is, I think as much an attempt to avoid that as an attempt to avoid SQL itself. CLSQL provides SQL semantics with Lisp syntax that can be used directly in Lisp programs.

There is a trick in the wording of, “The better adapted you are, the less adaptable you tend to be”, since “adaptation” was redefined in the second part of that statement. If you’re so well adapted to the current situation such that you fail to adapt to future, hypothetical, unknown situations, then what you’ve really done was to hyper-specialize and stop responding to change. This is not that one adapts too well so much as one got comfortable and <i>stopped</i> adapting.<p>In terms of practice, it means someone stops being mindful of the task on hand and starts performing his tasks mindlessly.

As of today, phones are purchased with contract, and iPhones are being sold at the same price as Android phones.</i><p>Huh?  I'm betting on nothing. I just quoted the retail prices of the devices as google found them for me. Whether you purchase them with contract or not doesn't make a difference other than pay now versus pay later.<p>Yes, apple <i>may</i> lower the iPhone prices to match up the cheaper android devices. There's just a tipping point where that won't make sense anymore. It won't be long before we see nexus-grade devices hit the street for half the price of a comparable iPhone, with equal build quality and feature-set. What then, will apple sell the latest iPhone for $199 <i>without</i> contract?  Will they add some gimmick to justify the premium price (what could that be then?)?<p>Touchscreen phones are becoming a commodity and apple can't change that. This is not a ""bet"" or guess, it's just plain old market forces at work (many manufacturers competing for the android market versus, well, apple).<p>Note that this is a bit of a different story than the mp3 player market. The ipod arguably still <i>is</i> the best mp3 player you can buy and afaik apple still holds the clickwheel patent to ensure that doesn't change too soon.<p>In the smartphone market the difference is nowhere near as clear cut. Android already is pretty close and apple doesn't hold any patents to push it back (unless you think they can win the multitouch case). So, as said, in short order we'll see android phones that match the iPhone experience. In fact, I'm quite sure soon enough we'll see android apps that <i>skin</i> your android to look near indistinguishable to an iPhone. Unless iPhone OS makes great leaps before that this might become the ultimate humiliation. How will apple sell me their $499 brick when my $199 brick plus a $5 app makes it look like theirs, plus multitasking and stuff?<p>That's the crossroad where apple will have to decide between trying to compete on price against the likes of HTC - or letting the iPhone fade back into a niche.",1270409545

Having as small a 'footprint' as possible - carbon or otherwise.<p>I probably first entertained this idea after reading translations of Buddhist texts or things like Merton's ""Saying of the Desert Fathers"". But for much of my life this was a fuzzy idea like most liberal thoughts something to declaim with out really applying. In my mind it took the form of a clean aesthetic - clean, Zen-inspired, Danish modernist work and living spaces. (Which couldnt be farther from the current reality of a 1000sq' apartment with my wife and two boys.)<p>When I first became conscious of GNU/FSF and Open Source this became a bit more concrete. Before I was able to get Linux working on whatever hardware I could find, it was interesting to me because of its economical and simple design which lent itself to self-reliance and control.<p>I've tried in little ways to wean myself of a certain style of spending/ consumption. Less Starbucks, double edged safety razors instead of plastic, public transit and walking instead of car - but I am far from an example to anyone.<p>But the idea that  ""less is better than more"" would almost seem anti-American up until the past few years. To me it always felt right. So many of our illnesses in the US are ones of over consumption - petroleum, hydrogenated oils, corn syrup, etc. It is hard for me to say if this is merely a aesthetic choice or also an ethical one. It seems to me that it is but I have a hard time formulating a convincing argument. I am not sure myself.<p>The impact of less and less consumption could hit the service industry and further reduce jobs. If we really lived within our means what would result?<p>On a tangent I saw a fun movie last night with James Cogburn and Rod Steiger - ""Duck, You Sucker!"" also called ""Fist full of Dynamite"" in Italian. Sergio Leone direction and Morricone score. Much of it corny and implausible but fun nevertheless. Steiger plays a semi-literate Mexican peasant who at one point blurts out ""revolutions are started by those who read and the ones who dont read suffer through them...""",1270408372

1240645,story,,,3,1,rcmorin,"Global in-app purchases for iPhone",,"Hello everyone.<p>I'm a product manager who works for a small internet company that is developing an iPhone application for a social network. We monetize by offering limited and premium memberships to users (premium members get additional features not available to limited members). For billing on the web, we use a 3rd-party payment gateway that is nearing retirement, and will be replaced by an in-house solution.<p>The business wants a global launch for our iPhone app using iTunes + in-app purchasing as a payment gateway. The problem with going global using this payment method is that for our web service membership level, available features, and subscription costs are defined by country. For example, in the US premium/limited memberships are available at 5 pricing tiers; in France premium/limited memberships are available at 5 different pricing tiers from the US; and in Chile the service is available for free and all features are available to users.<p>Is it possible then to have the server-side, based on the user's country of registration, control the level of access, features, and payment options for users on the iPhone? I'd also note that since iTunes Connect does not allow variable pricing by currency and country, each ""region"" would need 5 in app purchase options.<p>I argued for a US-only launch for iPhone using iTunes in app purchase until an in-house payment gateway is available. But you know...",1270408346

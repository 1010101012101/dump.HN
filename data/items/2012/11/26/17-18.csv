But then, you might ask what is effective communication especially in your context? Clearly, your client is not as tech. savvy as you might want him to be. So instead of mentioning Github directly for example, you need to think about the end goal that you want to achieve. In your example, I believe you wnat your client to agree to use Github for tracking the code changes, communication etc. But instead of saying that directly, you could say ""Hey as you mentioned that the site needs periodic updates, I propose using a tool that will reduce the time and error to put a fix and update your site regularly. This tool is available online and can be accessed both by you and me anywhere through internet. We can do it without this tool but it will increase the time to make changes to the site and ultimately cost you more""<p>Now you have given the ""what"" to the client and not the ""how"". The ""what"" is thte importance of using the tool (github) but you don't want to say that directly. The client will see that you are giving them an option to reduce their risk/time to update the site which is the end goal, not github. Github is just a medium that u decide for the client.<p>The next question from the client could then be ""Ok so what would it take to get this tool up and running. how much? how long? "" But now, you are already half way through.",1353952783

4833020,comment,4830140,4832916,5,0,jacquesm,,,"Sure. Fraud is one of the bigger risks when you deal with non-segregated merchant accounts. This basically means that when it comes to fraud there is an overall chargeback limit that you share with all the other merchants in the same cluster, as well as the risk that one or more of the merchants are processing so-called high risk transaction on a non-high-risk merchant account (or maybe even downright illegal transactions). If one of those merchants is substantially larger than the rest or if you are in a group that has a higher risk profile than you yourself have chances are that at some point VISA/MC/Whichever will fine the holder of the merchant account or will shut down the merchant account altogether. These fines can be substantial (sometimes in the millions) and this can cause the whole thing to collapse. If you're even more unlucky the money that was still pending deposit on the merchant account will be used to pay off part of the fine. If you have your own merchant account then if the payment service provider (Stripe in this case) makes a bad decision with acceptance of a particular merchant then that will only affect one merchant.<p>Exactly what the fall-out of such a problem is is highly dependent on the acceptance policy and the level of fraud prevention in place to make sure that bad apples are detected before it becomes a problem for a larger group of merchants as well as the size and composition of the clusters (sometimes there is only one such as was the case with IBill). This is - obviously - not under the control of the individual merchants so you have absolutely no guarantee that there is no risk from this angle and it is not in the interest of an IPSP using this model to disclose who their customers are and what the exact setup is (since this would give bad merchants a leg up on how to game the system).<p>The IPSP game is complex, there are lots of gotchas and there are a ton of things that have been tried in an arms race that is now roughly 18 years old. A late entrant to this arms race will find a lot of opposition armed to the teeth and battle hardened.<p>This is the reason why it is very hard to displace paypal, for all the flak they're getting they have the fraud angle under control. Stripe is still young and they are probably learning valuable lessons at a very fast rate. I have all the faith in them coming through this in one piece but that still does not detract from the fact that this particular model carries an extra risk.<p>If stripe were to offer an option (which likely would have to have better rates than their current plan) where higher volume merchants would be able to bring their own merchant account to the party then I think that would be positive for everybody. I'm not sure if they are thinking in this direction or if that option is even on the table for them. But it would make me feel a lot better about putting my apples in the stripe basket. And I <i>really</i> like the founders.<p>After having been bitten twice by the shared merchant account model I hope you'll forgive me my reservations, IBill and DMR cost me a very large amount of money and I'm not about to risk that once more. If you have $50 in sales every month then I can understand that a merchant account is not worth it but as soon as a business is more serious then your merchant account becomes your lifeline. IBill used some pretty dumb strategies for risk mitigation (such as adding low dollar amount charity charges into the mix to offset the high chargeback risk because the chargebacks were taken as a fraction of the total number of charges rather than of total charge volume which helped to mask a problem). Regardless of the rest of the setup, a merchant account you share with others translates into a (substantial) extra risk.<p>Another aspect here is that if your IPSP goes under that you lose access to your renewals, for a subscription based service that is lethal. And IPSPs are not usually allowed to give you a copy of the subscriber data because of card company regulations (PCI).<p>I hope that's detail enough for you.",1353952736

4833012,comment,4832568,4832706,1,0,frou_dh,,,"I found the Go module (aka package) system subtle to understand, but it seems to work well. The subtlety being that what you name when you write ""import"" is not a module, but a directory on the filesystem (under a known root). Actual module names that act as the namespace for a module's public identifiers do not have to be the same as (or derived from) the import path; that is just the convention. For example, importing ""utils"" could conceivably bring in bobsfunkystuff.SomeFunc with there being no such module as utils and hence utils.SomeFunc.<p>It's also my understanding that there are no ""submodules"" in Go. If you want what's in the import path ""foo/bar"", importing ""foo"" is unrelated. In fact, there might not be anything in ""foo"", making it an invalid import path, despite ""foo/bar"" being a valid one.<p>And then there's the stuff with being able to directly import code from github, code.google.com, etc, but that dovetails in to the same mechanism after downloading.",1353952675

When one LED burns out the whole chain is lost and the regulator would increase the voltage across the remaining chain until it was using enough current for two.  Naturally this will greatly shorten the life of the remaining eleven LEDs.<p>This is the worst case scenario and probably won't happen.  Two ways around it.<p>1) Since current is (non-linearly) proportionate to voltage, the regulator need to increase the voltage to compensate.  But all regulators have a maximum output voltage. If the regulator is cheap and running near its limits, it can't increase the voltage high enough to damage the remaining chain and the bulb will run a little hot but be fine.<p>2) LEDs get warm and should not operate above 85C.  A good regulator has a thermistor connected to the LEDs and will automatically drop the current to safe levels.  The bulb will once again run a little hot but will be mostly fine.<p>If there are more than two wires connecting the regulator to the LED it might have over-temperature protection.  Or if the regulator is physically connected to the heatsink.<p>The regulators themselves are pretty reliable.  I work mostly with low voltage DC lighting (12V-48V, 20W-100W) and there is nothing in the regulator that would wear out easily.  Line AC might be a different story, those probably have large filtering capacitors.  If the caps are electrolytic they might dry out eventually from the heat.",1353951730

Wouldn't adding a preprocessor directive like ""#include_once <header.h>"" solve this?  Alternatively, these guards could be added to the headers themselves without changing the preprocessor.   This probably should be a parallel set of headers (#include <std/stdio.h>) to avoid breaking the rare cases that depend on multiple inclusions, but creating that set would be a simple mechanical translation.<p><pre><code>   C++ templates exacerbate the problem\n</code></pre>\nI'm mostly a C programmer, so I have no argument here.<p><pre><code>   Precompiled headers are a terrible solution\n</code></pre>\nWhy is this?  It likely would break the ability of headers to be conditional on previous #define statement, but since the proposal does this anyway it doesn't seem insurmountable.  Along that lines, how does this proposal handle cases where one needs/wants conditional behavior in the header such as ""#ifdef WINDOWS"" or the like?  And is caching headers during the same compilation also ""terrible""?",1353951310

( <a href=""http://albertinepress.com/about.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://albertinepress.com/about.html</a> ) I'm not sure what the angle would be exactly, but they're just a few blocks away, and might have equipment and expertise that would allow for a more interesting kind of print-on-demand than the Espresso printer. And if bookstores are increasingly becoming fellow travelers with letterpress printers and vinyl shops and so on, maybe there are strategies in common.<p>- Others have mentioned affiliate fees. If book <i>stores</i> are no longer efficient ways to store and deliver books, but are still great ways to look at and play with and explore books, is it possible to fully transition to a book showroom instead of store? How would the business change if you were no longer thinking in terms of inventory, but only in terms of sample copies? You obtain exactly one copy of the very best books that fit comfortably in your space; the customer collects ones they like; and then they're scanned at the front desk, searched online, and the cheapest available copies of the quality they request are shipped to their address. So customers are getting Amazon prices (or better, because you might be better at running the search than they are), but the experience of discovering physical books. You could pay for it either with affiliate fees, if there's a program that works, or with a surcharge.<p>If you went down that path, your focus on the supply side would change from acquiring second-hand books, to finding really interesting ways to <i>discover</i> books. For example, shelves where you can flip through the top-ten favorite books of Bill Clinton, or Neil Gaiman, or Natalie Portman, or David Foster Wallace. Cyberpunk shelf curated by Neil Stephenson (with a blurb taped inside each cover if he'll write one!). Law & Tech shelf curated by Larry Lessig. Books by TED presenters. Make it so poking around the store is itself a learning experience.<p>Good luck -- I hope you manage to find someone, and their ideas are better than mine.",1353950772

And under a professional services model, they are clients, not customers.<p>How do you ensure that those downloading early versions of the software have a positive enough initial experience to commit to its use, in the absence of support...i.e. how do you get them to put up with perceived bugs, lack of features, cumbersome workflow, etc without some hand holding? It seems to me that a lack of upfront commitment contributes to few open source projects obtaining critical mass.<p>Products released for free start several disadvantages - the user has low expectations for value, support costs are unfunded, and the loose relationship between the developer and the user makes it difficult to have long insightful discussions about the user's needs.<p>Ultimately, the value proposition of the project you describe needs to fall within those typical of B2B, not ad supported smartphone apps.<p>The last question is, are you scratching your own itch as a developer with this project, or is it a startup idea?<p>Good luck.",1353950309

The only situation is if I'm a GitHub salesperson, or we're having a very non-casual conversation comparing tools.<p>Those aren't normal conversations.  GitHub is not a tool that normal people use.  Suggesting it to someone who is not a professional developer demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of your audience, of their skill set, of their engagement level, etc.<p>By definition, being a developer takes you out of ""normal,"" so you're not really well-suited to judge how other people are receiving you.  This is why you feel like it takes ""large expenditures of energy on my part"" to talk with them.  When, strictly speaking, <i>no-one has to talk with you.</i>  Talking is <i>entirely about the other person.</i><p>Growing up, I did speech contests, which teach you how to present and how to deliver an argument and how to articulate your ideas well in a short span.  Something like Toastmasters would help you practice that today.<p>That doesn't help you social situations, or in professional relationship building like business requires.<p>A friend of mine has a coworker who is socially rude.  The coworker constantly interrupts, and their voice gets higher and higher pitched and they talk faster and faster when they think you're not ""getting it.""  The problem is, all the senior developers ""get it,"" he's just so enamored with his idea that he's not seeing the practical issues.  The coworker is really looking for agreement and praise, not discussion and critique; his statements are leading, and his questions are rhetorical.<p>My friend finally sat this coworker down and explained how he needed to learn how to act like a normal human being having a normal human conversation.  My friend now physically intervenes in conversations and points out every instance of verbal malfeasance, and the coworker is learning to control himself and convey his ideas reasonably, to think before he responds, and to actually consider someone else's perspective for once.<p>This friend, years ago, would stand over my shoulder and edit my emails with me.<p>My friend doesn't scale, but maybe there's someone you trust -- not a programmer, a normal person -- who can do things like edit your emails for you -- that's what <i>editors are for</i> -- and who can shadow you in conversations and talk with you about them afterwards.",1353949394

Blue bg only covers half of it, rest of text is obviously unreadable. Looks like this is the result of the width: 1.25em; in the CSS. If I remove that, then the blue bg on hover doesn't span the box any more. Looks like these icons should really be applied as ::before or ::after, instead of modifying the element itself, as this seems to horribly break things.",1353949390

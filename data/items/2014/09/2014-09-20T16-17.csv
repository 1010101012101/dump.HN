I&#x27;m (also) not an IP lawyer, but as I understand it your use of the term &#x27;public domain&#x27; here is inappropriate.<p>If you&#x27;re arguing that JavaScript has become genericized - on the basis, presumably, that there are multiple institutions making available various implementations of JavaScript without acknowledging or licensing Oracle&#x27;s trademark - I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s correct, and typically that would only be settled in a legal case. Certainly, Google, for example, publishes V8 and describes it as a &quot;JavaScript Engine&quot; - and makes no trademark acknowledgement toward Oracle that I can see; if Oracle wanted to they could probably attempt to enforce their trademark rights there. Mozilla, who distribute SpiderMonkey as a &quot;JavaScript Engine&quot;, acknowledge the trademark (though they still attribute it to Sun). Oracle&#x27;s failure to continually distribute any product which makes use of their trademark might count against them, but if they wished to argue that Mozilla has continually exercised Netscape&#x27;s exclusive right to use the trademark, they might be able to get a sympathetic judge to rule Google out of order for claiming V8 is &#x27;JavaScript&#x27;.

But when you try the same for a 100m population, or a 1000m population, you&#x27;d get 10 compartments of 100m, 100 compartments of 10m below this, and 1000 compartments of 1m. To expect each to follow the national policy is very difficult to do. You either need a strong dictatorship, or you need to accept that different compartments may elect radically different policies, which is why I don&#x27;t think you can just implement and scale a policy to 1300m as easy as one can to 17m.<p>That&#x27;s why you see huge differences for example between states even in things we expect to all agree on. There&#x27;s very few national policies that simply scale to all states exactly the same, the military probably being a big one. But things like education, police or fire departments, housing, healthcare or even marriage, can be radically different. But here in the Netherlands? On tons of topics like education, police, healthcare or marriage, it&#x27;s exactly the same in every single province, because we&#x27;re pretty much one big state, despite quite large differences between provinces. e.g. 2 hours north-east, I can&#x27;t understand the local language, here it&#x27;s mostly protestant but two hours south is mostly catholic. But despite big differences in culture, language, religion, but also industries and demographics, it&#x27;s extremely homogeneous in policies.

For example, for values of `r` just above 1 + sqrt(8) ~ 3.82842 you can observe a stable oscillation between three different values!<p>The math isn&#x27;t actually all that hard.

Ordinarily these have a very complicated solution, but in this case we already know two of the solutions, because any fixed point is automatically a period-2 cycle, so x = 0 and x = 1 - 1/r will satisfy the equation. We can get rid of those solutions using polynomial long division, leaving a quadratic equation, whose two solutions are the location of the points in a period-2 cycle!<p>We can do similar tricks to find period-4 cycles (an eighth order equation which can be reduced to 4th order by factoring out the fixed points and period-2 cycle) and period-3 cycles (a 6th-order equation that can be reduced to 4th order by factoring out the fixed points).<p>Proving the stability or instability of these cycles and fixed points is slightly more involved, but still not too hard - it just requires calculus at about the level you&#x27;d pick up in a late high school or early college course.",1411230316

If EV certs were believed by end users, wouldn&#x27;t we merely be creating a social engineering security hole? Competent thieves also would use EV certs and increase trust in their websites too.<p>Thankfully, I&#x27;ve never met an end user without technical knowledge who understood what an EV cert was. I do know what they are and I don&#x27;t trust them more than regular certs (which is not much for identity, but I do as protection against low-cost confidentiality and integrity attacks).<p>[1] Re: &quot;certainty&quot;: I know EV certs are supposed to be more secure and not perfectly secure, and that there is no perfect or &#x27;certain&#x27; security. However, few end users understand the latter, and of the ones that do few would take the time to learn the degree of increased security EV provides. We shouldn&#x27;t say, &#x27;trust the green bar&#x27; unless we expect people to do it.",1411229428

I live in Austin, TX in a single-family home that typically has 3-4 adults in it (me, my roommate, and an Airbnb that&#x27;s booked out almost every day with 1-2 additional adults.) That 3900 gallon usage, or 118 gal/day, is for <i>all</i> of us combined. So it&#x27;s quite doable in the US!<p>I think the biggest contributing factors are:<p>1) We don&#x27;t water the lawn.

In fact, if anything, I think we do way more laundry/dishes than the typical household thanks to having an Airbnb and wanting to keep everything clean for our guests.<p>My conclusion: Americans are going to have to give up on their green lawns, and prioritize energy efficiency in appliances, to get to this level.

A subtree merge is a one-time operation. git-subtree, on the other hand, enables you to continue to merge in upstream changes. You can also split the subtree (including it's history) from your repo and make it a standalone repository again.",1336115641

I dropped out of state after studying German and whatever to make money in the technology boom, and I did.  Lots.  For many years my career grew and I was at zero disadvantage to someone entering with a degree.  In the bust, I was even at an advantage for awhile as I had key experience over anyone competing with me.<p>Over time however it became evident the long term growth curve of my career had a lower slope than my college educated colleges.  Soon enough I couldn't move up any more.  In a deep, sit-down conversation with a respected manager I was told I would never make senior grade engineer without the degree.<p>Now in a start-up or small shop maybe this wouldn't matter.  In a Fortune 500 corp. it simply did.<p>Now I'm in my 30's and back in school.  At least I'm enjoying it this time :)",1336115296

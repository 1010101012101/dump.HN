PkD was rather a counter culture figure and was 'less than impressed' with Hollywood's attempts at his (or any other) book.<p>When he saw Ridley Scotts's work on the visuals of Blade runner he was amazed. Remember before this, and Scott's Alien most SF films consisted of putting the star in spandex and drapping the set with some tin foil.<p>This is especially gracious since Blade Runner takes one tiny part of a complex themed book and turns it into little more than a cop chase.

The more bass you want on a record, the wider the grooves need to be, which gives you less time per side; the more playing time you want on each side, the narrower the grooves need to be, and you don't get as much dynamic range, loudness, or frequency bandwidth.<p>Another example: there's some Yo La Tengo record, I forget the name (it's been a while), but it's a one sided 12"".

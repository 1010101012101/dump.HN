The mouse cursor can only be controlled up/down , left/right with it. With too much graphical work, that cut my use of it short.<p>Several years later I started a strength training program, and within a few weeks my RSI vanished. At its worst, my arms would be numb when I woke up, I had sustained numbness in one hand for weeks, at one point I couldn&#x27;t physically hold a mouse more than 15 minutes. It took a quick Google Image search to know I would never do a carpel tunnel release surgery.<p>After adding up the workout time spent, it was about 4 hours of strength training (no weights or gripping) that ended 5 years of debilitating wrist pain. From what I&#x27;ve been able to tell many years later, it was all from doing pushups -- which likely has everything to do with shoulder and back muscles. That ironic thing was, because the pain was in my wrists and arms, I thought doing pushups would cause too much pain so I had stopped doing them.<p>Now instead of ergonomics I think of how to be more active while and between working.",1391014536
7145058,comment,7142987,7143906,5,0,0x09,,,"This isn&#x27;t as complicated as this thread has made it out to be. Look at it from the perspective of a(n American) company that wants to distribute a product with kvazaar. They are prepared to purchase a distribution license from MPEG-LA for each copy sold (read: distributed), and the terms of that license do not include resale (or redistributed). Any customer redistributing their copy must purchase their own license from MPEG-LA. But they&#x27;re also beholden to the terms of the GPLv2, which says this:<p>> 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.* You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&#x27; exercise of the rights granted herein.<p>* Including unlimited redistribution in source or binary form as per sections 1 and 3.<p>Now there&#x27;s a problem. Guaranteeing the text of the GPL implicitly allows the user to infringe the patent license, while honoring the patent license violates the guarantee of the GPL. Such a binary becomes completely un-distributable. With permissive licenses that have no such clause, there&#x27;s nothing preventing Company X from distributing the licensed binary and source and telling the user that if they want to redistribute a binary, to buy a patent license of their own. That&#x27;s why the BSD license would not pose a problem for distribution in the presence of an extra, more restrictive license such as a patent package.",1391014530

I misread your statement where your point was instead to imply that whatever the truth, I lack the capability of determining it. ;)<p>I allege both are at work, but only due to the fact that its Communitarianism is a very shallow self categorization, a glorified self image. As a whole, I think American society is rather exclusive, it&#x27;s religiously controlled and does have strong authoritarian traits in my opinion, but I already said why.<p>To give one example why I think Communitarianism is self-deceptive: the group of people who tend to be against creating social support structures are without fail religious conservatives. Health care, welfare, development programs, you name it - they&#x27;re against it. It may well be true that they believe those same functions should be administered through the local church community, but that doesn&#x27;t exactly make their intentions any less deplorable.<p>The fact that last week the whole community helped poor old Mrs Smith clean up her yard doesn&#x27;t make up for rejecting the funding of more social workers.<p><i>> You&#x27;ve moved the goalposts quite a bit</i><p>Granted. I felt it necessary to come back to the original point in the original post, since we have drifted quite a bit in an effort to &quot;correctly&quot; label American Protestantism. Making a generalized criticism of religion <i>was</i> my central point, talking about the perceived similarities between the American and the Muslim system was only an extension of it.<p>When I expressed a hope that education could lead rationalism and humanism, I was implying that it could do so by healing away religious ignorance.",1391013809

That would be weird. 76 heads strongly suggests you were wrong about there being a tail side to that coin.<p>The frequentist concludes that she&#x27;s dealing with something anomalous: the distribution is all off. The difference is in <i>how</i> this is built into the math: frequentist statistics can reveal, say, the difference between flip 4 being tails (and all the others heads) and flip 72 being tails (with all the others heads), whereas in Bayesian terms it just &#x27;falls out&#x27; of the math.<p>So here&#x27;s a fun one. Given the 10h-10t-10h-10t-10h-10t-10h-6t: which model does the best job of predicting (correctly imho) that we&#x27;re more likely to see four more tails than anything else?",1391013777

Many people believe, on both the right and the left, that the imposition of rules on individuals by the community can lead to more actual freedom than a scenario in which individuals act without restrictions.<p>Now, whether American religious communities display more of the characteristics of communitarianism or authoritarianism is a matter of opinion.<p>> But to your point. Just because your religion provides you with a &quot;personal relationship with God&quot; (which I believe pretty much every single religion does by the way), doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re not living in a restrictive framework of questionable ethics.<p>And my point is that American Christianity focuses on the person relationship with God, and not an authoritarian framework, while Islam in Islamic countries tends to focus on the authoritarian framework. American pastors by and large do not get in front of their congregations and say &quot;do this and don&#x27;t do this, otherwise you&#x27;ll burn in hell.&quot; To most American Christians, that&#x27;s not the function of religion in their lives. But in most Muslim countries, that is the function of religion. They don&#x27;t eat pork because their Imam says not to. They wear headscarves because their Imam says to. The relationship with God is also important, but the regulatory framework derived from religious text as interpreted by religious authorities is also very important.<p>You&#x27;re entitled to believe that the ethical framework of American Christianity is questionable, but that doesn&#x27;t make it authoritarian. And you&#x27;re welcome to believe that American Protestantism is a conservative throwback, but that doesn&#x27;t make it authoritarian. Believe it or not, free thinking people can find their own way to conservative ideas, and free communities can impose conservative rules on their members because they feel it will enhance their collective prosperity, not just because some authority figure tells them to.<p>>  I criticize the validity of a belief in imaginary magical beings, especially ones that spread fear, ignorance, and suffering as their believers impose this nonsense upon themselves and, more importantly, others.<p>You&#x27;ve moved the goalposts quite a bit, from asserting that American society is essentially authoritarian in the same way as Islamic society, to making a generic criticism of religion. Religion = bad, and America and Saudi Arabia, etc, have lots of religious people, and that&#x27;s bad. Right? You&#x27;re ignoring that the function and nature of religion between the two societies is very different.",1391013375

It&#x27;s a reassurance in the idea that if you&#x27;re deciding if you want to make the purchase or not, that the site will have no problems in accepting the payment option you would like to use. Plus, in a strange sort of way, it implies the site is a valid on-the-level company because surely a credit card company would come down hard on a scam site for using their copyrighted visual identity.<p>There&#x27;s not much valid reasons other than it&#x27;s a visual thing for customers. Although I always suggested using the method of displaying the type of card after starting the number, that goes against the reassurance thing.

Here are a few things to consider.<p>First, we&#x27;re only talking about language. We get those gendered pronouns not because of a need to distinguish between how a person views his gender (or how the world views it), but because of stupid linguistic convention going back to English&#x27;s Indo-European roots. You&#x27;ll see that in many languages in the same family, nouns all have gender, even absurd ones like &quot;airplane&quot; or &quot;shoe&quot;. These genders have absolutely nothing to do with sexual identity, they&#x27;re essentially randomly assigned, conferring no additional meaning (but providing a parity check in communication, helping ensure clear transmission). Coming from this history, we shouldn&#x27;t be too concerned with the way pronouns correspond to individual humans.<p>Second, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s hard to imagine socially-undesirable consequences of honoring anyone&#x27;s own claimed gender. I&#x27;m thinking of a biological-male claiming to self-identify as female, so that he can use the women&#x27;s locker room at the gym. So under what circumstances do we want to honor their self-image (or, for that matter, to <i>believe</i> their claimed self-image)?<p>Third, with identity politics still having legal bearing in our system, it seems that self-identification of gender may derail efforts to ensure gender equality. Given that there are legal structures in place to protect females, may I (as a biological male) claim to self-identify as female, and achieve those same protections? May I at least self-identify on official forms (thereby making enforcement of workplace protections unenforceable)?<p>Not that these things are insoluble, but I think that we need to give thought to the repercussions should we choose to take any person&#x27;s claims of gender at face value.",1391013143

Lines of code is a god-awful measure of work, especially in a verbose language like Java or C#.</i><p>It&#x27;s not particularly large but add complexity to that and the work is insane. The application was implemented in C++ and COM for reference which is terse and complex.<p><i>I feel as if you have a flippant stance towards web-applications, which I promise you is incredibly misguided. Not everyone here is making TODO apps with Ruby.</i><p>Not particuarly. I&#x27;ve spent 18 years writing web applications (big ones) and do today. I&#x27;m a pragmatist and web applications are not for all use cases. In fact bar information presentation they are a complicated frustrating area. The emphasis is on smaller applications within this community by comparison which is where my point lies. The reality of real businesses with complicated procedures, processes and regulatory compliance is not something people have to deal with. Fanfaring about the death of IE7 shoots a big chunk of the industry in the face. These people do a disservice to us all.<p><i>Where to begin on this? To keep it somewhat related to the parent thread, I&#x27;d suggest that code for embedded systems is a different world than sharecropping on a Microsoft technology (or a code-bloat ERP almost certainly containing layers of awful sedimentary hacks placed by numerous outsourcing companies). In 2007, you had your head in the sand (while drinking the koolaid) if you thought ActiveX was a long-game.</i><p>The reliability and lifespan expectations are surprisingly similar. The delivered product is different but the processes and procedures are similar. yes in 2007 ActiveX had the writing on the wall but in 2007 the product was already 18 years old and was a 1998 port to COM/C++ from an AS400 platform.<p><i>Oh come on, this is just ageist. Was the guy that wrote something that only works on IE6/7/8 thinking ahead? What about an engineer that created a scenario in which hardware can&#x27;t be updated? Unless your code is going on a satellite, congrats on over-engineering a solution that only works in a given architecture</i><p>Not ageist. When this was written, they had Internet Explorer 4 and Netscape 4. Try engineering a solution that fulfills the requirements with any other technology than ActiveX at the time. Even Java wasn&#x27;t mature enough then. As for hardware it was designed to work for 30 years and they bought enough spare parts to make sure it does.<p><i>With most consumers thinking of computers as tools that access the web, thinking that you don&#x27;t have to be incredibly reactive to change is myopic. Do you think that writing maintainable stacks for a changing consumer preferences and patterns is something done without planning?</i><p>This is a temporal argument. When the application stack was designed 16 years ago, the world was a different place. And thanks to the lifecycle guarantees of Microsoft, that guarantee was made up to 2017. In 16 years the same will be true. Time needs to be frozen for certain things and guarantees need to be made otherwise it limits the ability to write off risk against big projects.<p><i>If your customer thinks that she can predict needs for the business 10 years in advance, she&#x27;s about to have her lunch eaten by another company.</i><p>Simply no. For some markets, yes but for a lot of traditional supply chains this isn&#x27;t the case. The company has been around for over 100 years so they&#x27;ve obviously done ok with high lead times and a static model for the last 60 years. Whilst there are some disruptive changes, particularly in the consumer-facing and retail sectors, the sheer amount of work, knowledge and momentum required to enter some industries is prohibitive so they are unlikely to be disrupted by new technology startups.<p><i>The &quot;technology press&quot; is media and investors.</i><p>Yes. Noise. They focus on the technology company, not the company that uses technology purely as a function of its business.<p><i>The &#x27;critical cogs&#x27; are maintained by kernel, hardware, and protocol devs that are typically paid by a company that doesn&#x27;t obsess over running ancient code on dinosaur hardware because that doesn&#x27;t scale with changing demand.</i><p>Actually no. The critical cogs are the ones that generate revenue. The kernel, hardware and protocol work is bought in. The unique algorithm, advantage or working model for your company is the revenue stream, not the stack. The stack is incidental to it. The port from COM to Java SE/EE here is seen as an incidental cost of doing business.<p><i>With respect, I feel like you&#x27;re drawing a line in the sand and being smug because you imagine your problem domain to be on somehow more &quot;pure&quot; side of engineering.</i><p>No it&#x27;s not pure; it&#x27;s just a considerably larger problem domain than most people anticipate and an unrepresented area of the industry amongst these circles.<p>Everyone has a story to tell; this is purely mine. I&#x27;m not suggest it&#x27;s right or wrong but there are two sides to every coin and people should consider both before they start a browser witch-hunt.",1391012556

The interviewer started asking questions about specific Python functions/methods without even asking me about previous work experience. He was so adamant in trying to understand if I could program that he simply forgot to ask about me. This turned me off instantly and I did not answer any questions. I kept the interview short and politely declined through email for any sub-sequent interviews.<p>Their product is APIs for the financial sector. I write APIs for a living, and have done so for a while. Including APIs for the financial sector. I understood their challenges, and the technology. But rather than try and get to know about my experience a little bit first, he decided to test me on my knowledge of some obscure explanation in the Python documentation.<p>In contrast, my current employer did the opposite. They got to know me a little bit first and then asked me questions about programming. They brought me in as a contractor for a short period of time and observed me work. Then they did three more interviews including a technical one. Which was really interesting to do because it revolved around the decisions made in the short project I was given. The process was very smooth, and I have already shipped a project for the company, and am in the process of shipping the second one. No silly questions about coin flipping, no fizz buzz on a whiteboard. Just real questions about my skills, and an opportunity to show them off on their own environment.

It might be tempting to think that knowing a one sentence summary is better than not hearing about the research at all, but it&#x27;s not so obvious to me.<p>Most (social science, nutrition, environmental science, economics, psychology etc.) research is deeply flawed. That includes study design, statistical analysis and interpretations. Politicians love to through money at scientists that look for simple straightforward causal relationships between such incredibly complex systems as human behaviour, brain chemistry, nutrition, genetics, etc. And that&#x27;s why there is so little reproducible research. You won&#x27;t get a right or wrong answer about whether, say, cannabis is harmful without taking into account, a person&#x27;s genetics, daily stress, the use of coffee, alcohol and other substances, their diet, their level of physical activity, social life, childhood trauma etc. But that would be too hard to interpret. Instead we get headlines like &quot;Teenagers smoking pot are (arbitrary number) more likely to develop schizophrenia&quot; and &quot;Cannabis has been shown to kill cancer cells&quot;, which leads absolutely nowhere, because they just delude people to thinking the scientists are answering the original question (&quot;is cannabis harmful?&quot;), which isn&#x27;t well defined in the first place.<p>The necessary part of improving the current state of social &quot;sciences&quot; is acknowledging that simple rules rarely govern complex systems, and therefore the public should be incredibly skeptical to any headlines that report that &quot;the scientists proved&quot; some straightforward &quot;law&quot;.<p>Source: I do data analysis for multiple research groups that  include psychology research (hormones, behaviour, depression), nursing research (breastfeeding, childbirth complication) and psycho-oncology research (quality of life of cancer patients and their caregivers).",1391011776

If I&#x27;m offered standard market rate then this will be very different to a situation where a developer has factored into the price the assignment of all IP.

The infamous Icesave accounts were <i>savings</i> accounts, not investments in the way you&#x27;d normally think of them. They were savings accounts that paid higher interest rates than just about anyone else in town (about 6% in the UK), but they still had the equivalent of FDIC protections (for the American readers out there).<p>The problem is that the Icelandic equivalent to the FDIC had nowhere near enough money to actually pay back all the guaranteed deposits that were lost, so they said, &quot;We&#x27;ll pay the Icelanders back first and then....hey look! A squirrel!&quot;<p>The UK and the Netherlands stepped in to cover the losses of their own citizens, but they also took Iceland to the European Court for failing to honor the required guarantees.  The importance was somewhat lessened as the assets of the failed Landsbanki bank that had offered these accounts could cover quite a lot of the debt owed to the UK and the Dutch, but yeah, Iceland did sort of screw them.

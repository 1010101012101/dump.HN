697232,comment,697016,697016,0,0,dasil003,,,"I really can't stand the hype around these document DBs anymore.  Sure SQL database are overapplied.  I realize many people are incompetent with them, and that they often don't give appropriate thoughts to alternatives.  The title is fair, but then it veers off very quickly into hyperbole and misrepresentation.<p>To state that the applicability of relational databases is narrow is egregious.  Any one of the list of reasons could be a reason to use a relational database, it doesn't require a significant portion at the author seems to imply.  There are other reasons too... like how error prone it is to write raw map-reduce code to generate a query that would be trivial, fast and guaranteed correct in any relational DB.  And I'm thoroughly sick of the boogeyman of scalability as well.  You can go up to the scale of 99.99% of web applications with relatively little hassle.<p>The article acts as if data integrity is usually not important, but for the vast majority of applications that are out there in the wild and older than a 6-month startup the data is far more valuable than the code.  For a huge subset of all data SQL databases represent it the most accurately with adequate performance.<p>I don't care if the pendulum has swung too far towards SQL--this type of article is intellectually dishonest and won't help anybody make better decisions, it's just more hype.",1247209044
697231,comment,696368,696785,0,0,ErikDB,,,"Zach Smith, one of the founders/makers is in both projects. Also, we (I'm RepRap developer) collaborate on designs to print and reuse each others technologies and ideas. Because both designs are completely open source, the can reuse whatever is practical and also differentiate themselves to be used in different 'market segments'. RepRap is meant to be more adjustable and modular, and meant to be able to replicate most of its own parts. The Makerbot doesn't have this requirement and can mostly be made on a laser cutter. Although several parts of the Makerbots are printed on Makerbots and/or RepRaps.<p>Erik de Bruijn

Is it perhaps because a several time convicted monopoly abuser is using the power granted to it by its multiple interlocking monopolies to prevent this from happening?<p>Uh, no, I'm pretty sure it's because creating an office suite is a hell of a lot of work, and because Office is really pretty good, and so it doesn't make business sense for anyone to compete right now.  If Office were lacking, you'd see competition.  As it is, I don't think the (near) monopoly on office suites is actually hurting anyone.  It's not like Microsoft isn't innovating - I've been using Office 2010 builds for a month now and it's very solid, with tons of improvements over Office 2007.",1247207911

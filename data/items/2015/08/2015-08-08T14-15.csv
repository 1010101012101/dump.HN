But there are some things for the average Silicon Valley entrepreneur to be aware of.<p>1.) Moving to the Iranian market is not your typical &quot;Shopify opens the doors for UK after X weeks of preparation&quot; type of activity. Making it in Iran as a foreigner will take you months and years of preparation.<p>2.) Don&#x27;t make the big foundations angry. They control most of the big corporations and led the economy during sanctions. Those corporations kept Iran self-sufficient. While the cars have the standard of the 80/90s, it never happened to me to drive in a car NOT produced or assembled in Iran. They won&#x27;t like to give up producing their stuff just because you want to revolutionize the market.<p>3.) Basic things you excpect are missing. Postal service is very unreliable. Currently, transferring money to the outside world is not possible (at least in Iran, the banking system may be considered top notch)<p>4.) Create the best possible customer service with real people to talk to or let it be. Iranians LOVE and expect PERFECT service.<p>5.) Do not bet all you money or your career on Iran right now. Political situation is unstable (not in Iran itself, but with the outside world). Your money is very easy to be lost if the Iranian governments decides once again that atomic powers are more important than a good economic situation. Invest money you can afford to lose.<p>One positive thing: do not get fooled by &quot;oh, they already have that&quot;. In many cases, things are copied (like the online used car markets) but they do not get the business model (connecting all dealers to it for a fee).<p>And one last thing:
While the government is anti-western, the population is not. Iranians in general love the West, the USA. They are the REAL friends (I personally consider the arabian world false friends). They do not want to copy our individualistic lifestyle for sure, but they value our services, products and political freedom a lot.<p>So with good preparation, go for it.",1439043540

10027258,comment,10026695,10027203,0,0,mistermann,,,"Maybe not a great example: dentistry.  While it is surely not &quot;simple&quot;, I don&#x27;t think it is nearly as complex as something like medicine, and it is fundamentally important basic need in everyone&#x27;s life.  But is also extremely expensive, and is often not covered by universal health even in countries where medicine is.<p>So, from time to time you&#x27;ll hear, typically in ethnic communities in western countries, of non-certified people practicing dentistry off the books.  I have no way of knowing what skill level they tend to operate at, but I&#x27;d be surprised if it wasn&#x27;t somewhat equivalent to where mainstream dentistry was at say 20 years ago - so certainly not the best, but far better than nothing.  But when it leaks out this is happening, they are shut down immediately.<p>As a comparison, auto mechanics is also quite complicated, but if you literally can&#x27;t afford to have it dealer serviced, at least you have less-better but affordable alternatives.  Not so with dentistry, because they have a powerful industry lobby that sees that any competition is formally illegal, and any freelancers have the full force of the law brought down to stop their practice.  The argument for this I imagine would be &quot;public safety&quot;, yet auto mechanics also has a public safety aspect, <i>a much larger one</i> I would argue, yet I can buy tools and work on my own car in my garage without breaking any laws.<p>And so it will go as technology progresses, industries and professions with government connections will often be untouchable.<p>The older I get, the more I see a similar pattern recurring everywhere (but in different forms), such as the &quot;Why is rent so high and pay so low&quot; article on the front page of HN today:  <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10024681"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10024681</a>",1439042725

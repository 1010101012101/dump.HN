Making software proprietary demotes a tool to an appliance we can only interact with in prescribed ways as mere consumers, a role which is beneath us. It severely limits the benefits society derives from your work, and I believe it also harms the customers through learned helplessness. Our incentive should be getting paid for <i>writing the code</i> as a work for hire, not coding on spec and then rent-seeking against people for finding it useful.<p>Before software, this was much less feasible and generally nobody bothered (e.g., this is why they still sell cars without the hood welded shut, and why simpler computers used to come with schematics).",1324176973

3365746,comment,3365071,3365437,2,0,wtallis,,,"Yield problems hurt superlinearly as you scale up the size of a chip. That's why the fastest graphics cards have two GPUs on board, and why two mid-range cards will usually offer a better price/performance ratio than the biggest, fastest single-GPU card. Besides, the biggest GPUs out there are already little more than arrays of hundreds or thousands of vector processors: AMD's current biggest is 2.6B transistors divided among 1536 shader processors running at 800-900 Mhz, and NVidia's biggest is 3B transistors divided among 512 shader processors running at 1.5Ghz.<p>That NVidia monster has a die size of about 520 mm^2. At that size, there's already a lot of waste due to the fact that wafers are round and the chips are rectangular, and that can only be reduced by making physically smaller chips. (Rumor has it that by the time NVidia's 529mm^2 GF100 chip was originally supposed to launch, yields were bad enough that they were getting only about 2 usable chips per 300mm wafer. The cost of chip production has a pretty much linear relationship with the number of wafers processed, so that <i>really</i> hurt.)",1324176839

Copyright is about power. In the case of the content industries, honking great amounts of government backed power to grant or withhold access to what is basically the shared culture of the planet. Enough to, eg: strong arm a company that would prefer not to be evil into accepting at-whim takedown - that's what power does. And that's what by-design amoral money-grubbing organizations do when you hand them that much power, they turn into thugs, because their only way to make money is to hold things hostage. Even those around them who would be moral are pulled into the amoral system, because of that power.<p>Regardless of whether you agree that artists and labels should be paid, copyright is a bad way to implement it.<p>Thus, defending copyright but saying ""you make me look bad"" - no, this is inevitable.

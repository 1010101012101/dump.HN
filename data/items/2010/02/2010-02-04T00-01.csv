1099425,comment,1098679,1098980,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Yeah, especially as online-publishing is a freedom of speech issue and unless Berlusconi rescinds Italy's membership in the European Union, he'd have to be able to prove that essentially banning access to free-speech online isn't a violation of freedom of speech European Court of Human Rights. Any judgement by the court is wholly binding on the member states and legally has to be complied with or they can ultimately be forced out of the EU, but would likely be subject to sanctions and receive no 'rebate' from the taxes their citizens pay to the EU.<p>Being forced out of the EU would mean all their citizens working in the EU, outside of Italy, could potentially lose employment <i>immediately</i> due to not having work visas. Every Italian citizen living in the EU would have 6-months to return to Italy, and by how most immigration policies work they would be unable to apply for a work visa or even citizenship within their country of occupation. The exact same would happen to any EU citizen living in Italy, which could potentially be devastating for the economy in Italy.",1265245062

I don't have time to look up the figures now (sorry) but last time I checked, wind was more expensive to build average capacity than nuclear, even when you compared the cost of <i>just</i> the wind turbines with the <i>complete</i> cost of nuke plants.<p>> If you use a Brayton-cycle gas turbine for a nuclear reactor, for example, now heat exchange to the gas becomes the biggest issue. And even the most optimized gas peaker turbine plants cost $500/kw.<p>Heat exchange to the gas is an issue, but it's the sort of issue that nuclear reactor designers have a lot of experience solving. The Chinese pebble bed reactors, for example, are cooled with helium gas, and they don't seem to have much trouble with that.<p>As for the cost of the turbines themselves, in general Brayton-cycle gas turbines are cheaper than steam turbines, and supercritical CO2 gas turbines are remarkably small, so they'll probably be cheaper than the conventional ones. Even conventional gas turbines would work, though.<p>Of course, when competing with natural gas burners, the fuel cost is a huge issue. Natural gas fuel costs are vastly higher than those of nuclear plants (per kilowatt-hour, of course).<p>I'm not sure I answered what you were saying, but I hope I covered something interesting.",1265244272

Newspapers are still stuck on the model of providing a ""full"" news experience to its readers much in the same way that many failed big dot-coms (Excite comes to mind) held too long to the ""portal"" model of the web during the first dot-com boom/bust.<p>In an era where communication is difficult there is value in aggregating that communication (local news, national news, international news, business news, sports, weather, broadcast advertisements, etc.) into one coherent source. There's a great network effect in that model. However, that model is broken by modern technology which has dramatically lowered the cost of communication. There no longer is any value to regurgitating the same AP wire report in the local paper since the cost to distribute such reports to the entire world are practically nil in the modern age.<p>There is still value in unique, original reporting but modern news institutions do so little of that. This is where the conflict comes from. The value of a newspaper was once the sum of the value of the network effect of the readership (e.g. in regards to classified ads) and the transmission of non-local news and the original reporting. Today none of those things have true value except the last. And, unfortunately for most papers, this is the most difficult, most costly, and lowest margin aspect of the entire paper.<p>There's still value in some of the things newspapers do, but newspapers still insist on defining themselves in forms that are no longer financially sensible in the context of modern technology. Until that changes (maybe via most newspapers dying and being replaced by more modern institutions) newspapers will continue their long slow slide into oblivion.",1265243296

You would just have 10,000 page contracts that would specify the liability of each individual shareholders is limited to X, a lawsuit must target all shareholders and damages/debts are limited to Y, etc. Basically, each contract would reproduce corporate law.<p>Then whenever you wanted to collect a debt or sue the company, you'd need to dig into the contract to figure out how.<p>Instead, we've created a useful simplification/standardization: you say ""Company X owes me $50,000"", and it's up to Company X to figure out internally how to deal with this.

As far as I know, the corporate charter of Apple is the standard ""increase shareholder value"" charter. In that case, it would not be acceptable for Apple to do this unless somehow segregation increased shareholder value. In fact, pushing segregation would be violating the rights of minority shareholders.<p>So isn't pushing agendas that have the sole purpose of increasing shareholder value potentially contradictory to the interests of the general public population of citizens, whom the government are obligated to serve?<p>> On the other hand, the corporate charter allowed Apple to devote 10% of their profits to general racism (or perhaps to general social causes, as agreed to by the board), then it would be acceptable regardless of the opinion of the minority.<p>Again the company now is acting as an inhuman entity. It has interests characterized by a charter, not by a human being's potentially malleable opinions.<p>> This is simply a question of contract law. If you don't like the charter of a company, don't buy shares.<p>Yes but some of us can't say no to an iPhone. Should we be forced to indirectly support segregation?<p>> This is not an issue restricted to corporations. In general, we allow people to persuade other people to vote in all sorts of ways. Some people have persuasive power accrued through unrelated methods.<p>Yes we allow individuals to do that. But there is a reason corporations imposing their influence is frowned upon. I think your misunderstanding stems from the fact that you see a company as having the rights of a person. But a company is not a person. A company does not have the same needs as a person and thus it has the possibility of having conflicting interests with those of a citizen. The government is here to provide equal representation for citizens, not arbitrary entities.<p>> For example, Barack Obama has verbal persuasive power accrued through methods (community organizing and teaching law) completely unrelated to government insurance, union bailouts and cash for clunkers. Should he be forbidden from speaking?<p>No because Barack Obama is a human, he is not a corporation. He has a right to speak for human beings' interests because he is one (at least the last time I checked). A company is not a human. It has a distinct non-human character defined by your so called ""corporate charter."" A corporation accruing power (through money) is different from a human accruing power through money, or otherwise. A corporation does it because it has to, a human does it for a plethora of reasons unknown. But we do know that whatever the human's reasons are, they are because he/she is a human. And the government is supposed to represent the interest of human citizens.",1265242905

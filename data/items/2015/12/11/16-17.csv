So you&#x27;d need a JSON structure that has &quot;a hash of a hash of a hash ... pointing to an array&quot; with a depth in the 60s before you&#x27;d get a recursion call.  And the real program stack shouldn&#x27;t take that much per call (I didn&#x27;t optimize this part, so I&#x27;m not sure what the minimum is).<p>I only wrote a JSON validator, but my method should apply to cases where JSON elements are being placed into a data structure.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that a JSON parser could be written in C/C++ that requires less than 1kb overhead, where most of that is the string buffer.<p>I make no claims about speed though, as my concern was proving the bit part (I suspect speed using my method would be worse than the naive per character jump table).<p>[1] <a href=""http://web.cs.dal.ca/~sjackson/bitJson/JSON.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.cs.dal.ca/~sjackson/bitJson/JSON.html</a>",1449853170

In one case I was asked to directly do something that would cause me to be acting in an illegal way, in two of the cases it would result in a company doing something that was illegal.<p>Yes, CTO&#x27;s can run a &#x27;special project&#x27; but the engineers are quite aware of the situation with respect to emission targets in this specific case and must have been very much aware that they were doing something that was fraudulent. The people mentioned there certainly had incentives but did not have VW in their pocket to such an extent that they could interpret their mandate as carte-blanche to commit fraud. These are not stupid people, on the contrary. My interpretation is that they were told to do this &#x27;in whatever way possible&#x27; and that they interpreted this possibly as &#x27;and that includes illegal but don&#x27;t tell me about it&#x27;. Plausible deniability are the key words.<p>Whether that&#x27;s the case or not will come out in due time, it always does. See Oliver North, Watergate and countless other scandals where you can only throw so many people under the bus until someone does a tell-all.<p>I note that the prosecutor hedges his words carefully (&#x27;likely&#x27; and &#x27;orchestrated&#x27;) and I also note that on the VW org chart it would not take more than 10 people to go from the CEO level all the way to a single programmer to insert this code.<p>That would also still require someone to either cooperate with this scheme at the auditors side, especially given the nature of the Bosch memo and the document linked by user PeterStuer which you may take as common knowledge within the automotive industry. In such circumstances a source code level audit of the software that ends up in the shipping devices to make sure everything is above board would seem to be indicated at a minimum.",1449853133

10718141,comment,10714660,10714660,0,0,yason,,,"&quot;What is the future of Amiga&quot; asks the cover for issue #1.<p>There hasn&#x27;t been a future for Amiga for a couple of decades. Amiga was dead in 1995 already, not to mention 2015.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I think I used mine till early 00&#x27;s (for serious stuff, such as email and work). I loved Amiga and I think no other platform except BeOS has ever captured the same feeling that you get from having hugely advanced technology in your hands. If I could jump back to the 80&#x27;s/90&#x27;s which is the time I got my serious with my Amiga, I would. No doubt about it.<p>But Amiga as we know it is dead and has been dead for so long I barely remember. I would welcome another Amiga that would again be such a state of the art platform that it would compare to nothing else――although I wouldn&#x27;t know what that could it be. Maybe you could say iOS is the new Amiga, but it doesn&#x27;t convey the same feeling.<p>What I do remember from Amiga was how snappy it was.<p>AmigaOS had a modern design with no bloat. My i486 running my first Linux installation in the mid-90&#x27;s beat it hands down, technically, but it never felt the same. Things were crazy fast (in comparison to MC68030) but they never <i>felt fast</i>. And feeling counts for 99% for a human being, even if my mind is telling me my phone is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than my Amiga.<p>In contrast to how my Linux@i486 behaved my Amiga did just what it had to do. Linux (and Windows and Mac) always seemed to do a lot of things until they bothered to do what I asked. I&#x27;ve only experienced something similar in BeOS. It&#x27;s weird that there are no other mainstream operating systems where user interface would be prioritized over anything else. I still experience lag in my 10&#x27;s machines when running Ubuntu whereas I&#x27;m longing for the experience where no button or window ever hesitated to behave when I asked it to. It would be very much possible to implement (run UI in a single process that is never paged to disk and runs on SCHED_RT priority and never depends on the application itself to ultimately react to user interface events) but nobody has done it. Yet that&#x27;s what I still do miss from Amiga. The feeling is almost tactile, and it needs to feel it comes from 20 years in the future.<p>I don&#x27;t know how I feel about any Amiga magazine or any of the Amiga rebirth projects there are. AROS is nice but none of them is the same. Even if we did 00&#x27;s things in 80&#x27;s architecture running on 10&#x27;s hardware, it&#x27;s not the same. I don&#x27;t give a dime about keeping the old Amiga on life support. Every few years I fire up UAE and conclude that, all right, it still has that <i>X</i> but is lacking <i>A-W</i> and <i>Y-Z</i>. I understand that I&#x27;m a human being and my emotions attach to points in time, and that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s going to be. It&#x27;s worth remembering but not holding on to. At best, we can take what was extraordinary back then and if it&#x27;s still extraordinary, reimplement it on a modern platform.",1449852726

Look at the economic performance of the Netherlands or Finland during the last year. And of course the south is still unable to employ a lot of the youth and Greece is worst than ever.<p>2. &quot;Far-right&quot; is not a good description of these parties. They are anti-immigration. That is the only thing they have in common. They disagree on other issues.<p>3. People turn to these parties because like in the US, the political landscape in Europe has shifted to the right, economically. A blatant example of this is that both the center right and center left are fully supportive of TTIP. The only other notable alternative besides the anti-immigration parties is the Greens but the Greens are highly opinionated about many things that tends to turn people off. Plus they have been there since forever and not achieved much so people do not see them as &quot;change&quot;.<p>4. &quot;The typical political reaction to financial crises is as follows: votes for far-right parties increase strongly, government majorities shrink, the fractionalisation of parliaments rises and the overall number of parties represented in parliament jumps. These developments likely hinder crisis resolution and contribute to political gridlock. The resulting policy uncertainty may contribute to the much-debated slow economic recoveries from financial crises.&quot;<p>Way to spin that into a bad thing!

One I read about consists of the HFTs putting small tripwire sell orders on some exchanges to detect buy activity, then front running big orders by buying up all the stock on other exchanges and offering it at a higher price.  The HFT performs no function besides inserting themselves as a middleman.  It&#x27;s like being on Amazon, clicking buy on a $10 item from seller A, then either having your order fail or be filled by seller B (who themselves just bought from seller A) at a higher price.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_running"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_running</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Boys"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Boys</a>",1449852346

I understand the argument you&#x27;re making about economic signaling, and indeed YC(b)&#x27;s milquetoast declaration of encouraging women and minority applicants would be a cheap sop to political correctness. But I think you elide an important point, which is that YC(a)&#x27;s signaling, though expensive, is <i>also</i> motivated by political correctness. In other words, you&#x27;ve tweaked two variables, when in fact only one has changed; a more accurate rendering is<p><i>YC(a) is serious about being politically correct, while YC(b) merely cares about</i> appearing <i>to be politically correct.</i><p>Political correctness is common to the two cases for the simple reason that YC(a) would inevitably help wealthy, well-connected female and black/Latino founders to the exclusion of, say, poor, less-privileged Asian founders. It&#x27;s hard to explain this behavior in humanitarian terms, but it&#x27;s easy to explain in political terms. Nobody gets in trouble these days for expressing the sentiment that we need more women, blacks, and Latinos in tech, no matter how rich and well-connected they may be.<p>The only other possibility I can think of is that YC(a) genuinely wants to help especially deserving founders, and such founders are so overrepresented among women and blacks/Latinos that specifically targeting those groups achieves the goal well enough for YC&#x27;s purposes. In other words, the cost of <i>reaching</i> such founders may be so much lower when targeting specific self-identified groups that it&#x27;s worth the minor cost of helping the occasional privileged member of one of those groups. Still, it&#x27;s hard to avoid the observation that this policy is generally aligned with political correctness, which would appear to justify some skepticism.<p>(My guess is that YC&#x27;s policy isn&#x27;t Machiavellian in the least, but it works adaptively because of a political environment in which explicitly helping women and blacks/Latinos is strongly favored both by custom and by law.)",1449852276

But except for the homeless, housing is not a problem in Baltimore; houses sell for as low as $10K, $20K, $30K. Nobody is buying them (or at least at a very slow trickle). Yet we still have various activist groups talking about the problem of gentrification.<p>One interesting thing to note is how racially divided the city is. There are five or six majority white neighborhoods in the city, surrounded by majority black and latino neighborhoods. Those majority white neighborhoods expand a little bit every year - sometimes just becoming more dense, but sometimes the boundaries expand. When that happens it creates a sort of new market - new stores with higher prices, homes converted to apartments with higher than average rent.<p>At the same time, it also pushes out traditional &quot;black culture&quot; businesses - babershops and hair/nail salons, liquor stores, takeout food, dingy bars. These businesses are the social gathering places for black people in the city, and when they disappear, so does the presence of black people in daily life. There are other issues that come up too, like strained tensions over an increase in (arguably hostile) police activity around majority-white populations. Even as new businesses come into the neighborhood, you don&#x27;t see an increase in jobs for people who already lived there.<p>It&#x27;s easy to see how the people moving in are not there to help the impoverished existing residents. And it is true that rents do gradually increase. But at the same time, crime does reduce, and more money is invested in the local community.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen anyone pushed out of their home due to rising rents around Baltimore, mainly because we have so many god damn empty homes. But could it happen in a crowded neighborhood? If they are renting, abso-fucking-lutely; rents have been raising in neighborhoods around here for years, with one landlord turning the building over to another and raising the price.<p>The question isn&#x27;t whether this happens, but what happens to the people once they have to move out. Where do they go? Do they have to start at a new school, find a new job? Are they now far away from their families, some of whom they might be supporting, like the elderly or people who need stay at home child care? And can they even afford to move, if their home was multi-generational and they don&#x27;t have the funds to buy a new one? These are the questions the article doesn&#x27;t address.",1449852092

Redlining and related issues are huge problems that need to be addressed if we want to have healthy cities.)<p>The problems (gentrification) start when the market rate is <i>actually</i> something like $2k/mo or even higher due to popularity and limited space.<p>It would probably be fine if that rate was due to simple inflation, as the ability to afford rents at these higher rates would have similarly increased. This could even be an acceptable local effect if local wages kept up with local cost of living.<p>However, in popular big cities, wages have not kept up, so if rents are allowed to rise to the market rate <i>everywhere</i> in the city, the entire poorer end of the population - who are necessary for any city to function properly - tend to end up displaced.<p>In <i>theory</i> this could probably be addressed by proper zoning. Allowing some high-end expensive housing is fine; it just needs to be balanced with an appropriate[1] amount zoning for lower-income housing. I fear this could be another area that is easily abused for both social class or racial purposes, but that&#x27;s probably a problem regardless.<p>Other areas have addressed these problems with very strong rent control laws.<p>As cities grow and the population become more dense, these issues will become more common. The answer obviously isn&#x27;t a pure free market, though I doubt we have invented the best way to regulate these problems.

They, in turn, object to him. The British feminist epistemologist Hillary Rose, for instance, in a review of Science in Action, wrote: &quot;By cutting himself adrift from those who point to the dominant interests which science serves and to the masculine composition of its workforce and its knowledge, [Latour] sidesteps the crucial challenge.... Unless feminism engages in a rather sharp struggle for social and conceptual space, both networks and analysis are likely to remain integral to masculinist hegemony.&#x27;&#x27;<p><a href=""http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9410/latour.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9410/latour.html</a>",1449851175

They convinced themselves that rationality means trusting an external system so that if it leads to something counterintuitive, it must surely be seriously accepted. I mean it&#x27;s kind of how it works, you shouldn&#x27;t rule out your potential conclusions at the outset, but real life is a lot messier than theories. And I know one can say, this sounds like an excuse to be lazy and unreflective and uninterested in the world&#x27;s problems, but actually all I&#x27;m saying is you can&#x27;t obsess over this sort of thing and keep your mental hygiene at the same time. This sort of thing can make people burn out or become actually depressed or paranoid.<p>One must keep the ability to laugh at oneself, to be able to humorously see a kind of futility in what one does but dance the dance anyway. Clenching too hard, making one more nested iteration in the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma or the chicken game won&#x27;t help.<p>Also don&#x27;t take stuff more seriously than a certain ceiling.<p>For me, reading about Zen ideas helped me get out of this narrow, &quot;rationalized&quot;, neatly ordered, algorithmic, packaged-and-labeled way of thinking. Metaphorically it&#x27;s kind of the difference between a probabilistic machine learning system vs. a symbolic knowledge system where everything is defined precisely and unambiguously and every rule is laid out etc.<p>I&#x27;m still materialist and atheist, but I think being too deeply involved in any ideology is harmful (be it Marxism or Fascism or Scientology or LW). Yeah, you can reflect upon whether it&#x27;s possible to live truly independent of ideologies without making or finding a new one for yourself. But there are certain indicators, like when you feel you&#x27;re getting distanced away from the people around you physically, when you start feeling superior for belonging to the in-group etc., it usually means you&#x27;re just not noticing some aspects and are obsessing over something. Sure one can say that if innovators thought like this and always stayed in line of the mainstream, we never would have gotten Ford or Jobs etc. And there is truth to this, but it kind of sounds like &quot;X dropped out of college and went on to be successful therefore dropping out of college is a good idea&quot;. No, generally the good idea is to be humble and positive about the people around you, be open and reflective but not obsessive and be able to relax.",1449850607

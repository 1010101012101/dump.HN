437881,comment,437727,437841,0,0,azanar,,,">Newspaper circulation is actually more than I expected...all this bitching and moaning about how newspapers are dying, and they only lost 10%.<p>That is enough, though. Businesses don't just care about sales, they also care about net profit. The ratio of the latter to the former is profit margin, and indicates how what percent revenue needs to fall in order for a company to go into the red. A small change in sales can result in a large change in profit margin, depending on the costs involved in running the business. The NYT ran a 3.4% profit margin in 2007, on revenues of $3.1bn. A small change in that revenue is all it takes to put them in the red. If they have lost 10% of their circulation, assuming advertisers become disinterested at a similar rate, that is more than a sufficient amount of pain.<p>FWIW, this has borne out in Q3 2008. Profit margins at NYT are at -16.72% for Q3. Revenue was at $687.04, which is a 10% drop from the same quarter a year ago. Annualized revenue from Q3 is at $2.748bn, or a 14% drop from the prior year. Not counting the $160m ""unusual"" expense they took -- whatever that was from, that still around 10% drop in revenue, and a profit margin of right around 0%. I can't imagine Q4 will be any more rosy given the trajectory of their revenue.<p>I suspect we'll see more cost cutting there in the coming month, which will likely result in a reduction of reporters and other staff. It would seem to follow that either a smaller paper, or less expensive (read: more fluffy) articles will result, which runs the risk of further reducing sales. Not a happy cycle.<p>So yeah, it's enough.<p>Source for figures: <a href=""http://finance.google.com/finance?q=NYT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://finance.google.com/finance?q=NYT</a>",1232179054

George Soros is legendary for this; he's been known to back out of billion dollar investments the next day.  Most good managers are like this too.<p>The crucial part is <i>data</i>, and how they evaluate that data.  And not having read the blog post, I can't say whether Warrior's thought process makes sense.  But I really hate the idea that ""Passionate people cling to their ideas at all costs"" - that's responsible for most of the failures and wasted effort in the world today.",1232179050

437869,comment,436870,437048,0,0,spoondan,,,"I think your point can be summarized most plainly by saying PHP is cheap to host. I don't doubt that is a large part of its continuing popularity. But it is begging the question: Hosting providers didn't force PHP on the world, they met a demand. Where did that demand come from?<p>I don't think its technical merits (such as they are), community, documentation, or appeal to hosting providers is to blame. I think the answer is rather simpler: PHP was the only language that tied itself to the ""build a website"" niche in both its implementation and its marketing. Sun's contemporary efforts with Java were scattered and, even in the web domain, more focused on applets. PHP had ""build a website"" written all over it.<p>In short, I think it comes down to the old adage: location, location, location. PHP was perfectly positioned. The web boomed, and PHP rode its coattails. Anything with even the slimmest virtues could have succeeded with such good placement. In fact, it did.",1232178232

The belief that change is difficult leads people to expect that the database will never change.  Which leads to programming practices that aren't flexible enough to change large sections of code rapidly.  Which leads to software that is difficult to maintain in the face of schema changes.<p>Start from the assumption that the database will change often, however, and you'll build refactorability in from the start.  If Junior dev Jimmy drops a NOT NULL constraing on a column someplace, then suddenly the continuous build will break on seven unrelated projects, and those teams will spend 5 minutes each patching the code, testing and getting the build fixed.<p>It's really not hard.

You can't tell me that every web host worth their salt didn't (or doesn't) offer up a cgi-bin directory.<p>I would characterize it as this: PHP is a Perl-like language that is entirely web oriented.<p>Because Rasmus built PHP to make web sites it was oriented towards the web from day 1. Since it's similar to Perl (dynamic typing, just-in-time, etc) it's easy to learn and flexible.<p>However, unlike Perl there was no existing community with a non web focus. This made it very easy for the PHP community to rally around web projects and achieve all the things that made it good for the web and hence extremely adoptable.",1232177774

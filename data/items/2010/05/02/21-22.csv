We want to provide social media management services to nonprofits to improve their public relations and meet their goals (fundraising, recruiting volunteers, increasing awareness, etc). Currently, I provide web services to NPOs, but we are thinking of expanding this service to include support for social media outlets such as Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, etc. The individual organization's needs would steer what specific type of services they would want (as in, if they are really in need of volunteers, we'd concentrate on expanding their volunteermatch profile and local, community-specific forums for volunteers).<p>The problem we see is that a lot of small and medium sized nonprofits don't have the capacity to manage a successful social media program. At best, a lot of nonprofits think its sufficient to set up a facebook or twitter account with minimal maintenance or updates. We would argue that it takes a lot more than that for a nonprofit to successfully engage constituents on the web. Our solution is to provide these types of services to nonprofits.<p>I can give more details as needed, but basically we're wondering if this would work. Do you see this as a need in the sector? How should we consider tweaking our idea to improve our services or make them more appealing? How much would you pay (or think is a fair price) for this service?<p>Any help or advice is appreciated.",1272835118

Not very good for a mouse/pen combo...but I can easily imagine some evolution of it on my phone. Android already presents picture galleries in a 'pile of photos' fashion, and while there's a limit amount of space on the phone for throwing things about, some tablet device could certainly benefit from a shuffly physics metaphor.",1272834737

But tptacek (the author of the parent comment to your comment) did not write his comment as one HN insider speaking to others, but as a technically aware Facebook user to others. My personal observation of Facebook user behavior (including my many Facebook friends who are not at all hackers) squares with his. My favorite kind of link to post on Facebook is any well written link about security issues with Facebook. My friends read those, and share them with their friends, and most of the friends are reasonably cautious in how they use Facebook. We still have a good time. I don't see Facebook advertisements because I run a general ad-blocker on my browser. I don't sign up for Facebook applications in general. I just have good conversations (much like this one with you) with friends who know me in real life, about links that we find interesting.",1272834582

I have never seen anyone older than 30 write anything intelligent about Facebook. You people are not real users. Please understand this. How you ""use"" Facebook is so completely different from how people in college and recent grads use Facebook. For you, most of your pictures were what you actually posted yourself. For real Facebook power users, the vast, vast majority of photos come from other people. It's becoming clear that understanding of Facebook is the clearest dividing line between those in their late twenties and beyond and those younger. You pretend users really sound like old men shouting at kids to stay off your lawn. Why don't you at least try to educate yourselves about how Facebook actually works?",1272834534

For example <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_made_by_Raymond_Kurzweil"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_made_by_Raymond_Kur...</a> are spot on so far. What ideas do you have that aren't there? No big ideas that's for sure.<p>Startups mainly work by using existing technology to make a working service in a few years. The main problems are economic, social, psychological, not technological.<p>Will people use some silly limited email service? Yes, because it alters the psychology of communication, enables them to talk to more people quicker. Will people use a search engine that indexes the web? Yes if content on the web is worth a damn. Will labeling the world through people's IDs instead of URLs and brands be more efficient? Yes if you pull it off.<p>Will people pay for Adobe's apps instead of buying templates? Yes if they're convinced by designers that templates are bad and they need to go through an exclusive branding ritual.<p>A lot of startups are so mesmerized by what's possible with current technology they can't see two steps ahead. They come up with pretty small ideas in most cases and it's often difficult to link those ideas to the big technological trends even when the startup gets as big as Mint or Twitter.<p>That's why VCs don't care about ideas. We already have the ideas. If you understand tech like Ray Kurzweil did, you can shit out ideas all day. VCs care about fitting into the unpredictable world of fickle humans, like Twitter's 140 characters did, and your motivation to slave away.<p>The tech economy will move forward one way or another. In the big scheme of things we will get to AI and understand our own brains until we can predict if Twitter should add the ability to subdivide long texts into 150 character chunks to limit the size of rants like this one.",1272834510

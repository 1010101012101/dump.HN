3911090,comment,3910612,3910612,7,0,robatsu,,,"There is a little bit of misunderstanding sometimes when people discuss ""inflation"".  To some, if not most people, inflation means increasing prices.  To others, it means increase in the money supply, which eventually may cause rising prices after some latency, especially if the growth rate of the economy doesn't keep up with the increase in money supply.<p>I have no idea whether ""rising price inflation"" has been underreported, especially by design, by the government.  I would concede that there are political and bottom line reasons (e.g, minimize increases in salaries/benefits tied to COLA), but again, if this is happening, IMO it is probably more just institutional slouch than a top-secret directive from the Federal Reserve bunker.<p>Overall, I don't have an informed opinion what the facts of the matter are wrt to underreported inflation - I only have anecdotal evidence.<p>OTOH, it is pretty clear that ""money supply inflation"" has increased dramatically in the past few years due to the various policies associated with the bailout.<p>Whether this will cause ""rising price inflation"" remains to be seen - there is always latency between money supply increase and rising prices.  In the bailout policies case, the latency is pretty large, as the bulk of the money went to securing ""toxic"" assets and so forth rather than directly into the consumer economy.<p>The overhang of this increase in money supply/government debt naturally constitutes rising price pressure, but again, how much is anyone's guess, as there are deflationary pressures as well (falling asset prices, and such).",1335815838

3911088,comment,3909326,3910992,3,0,chc,,,"I guess it depends on how much time you have to listen. Based on the evidence on display in HN comment threads, I think on average most programmers' opinions on the law are probably a little bit better-informed than those of a Starbucks barista, but not enough so that I'd give somebody's opinion deference just because he knew C++.<p>Most programmers' opinions on the law (like most people in general) fall into one of two categories: fundamentally mistaken (e.g. ""sharing an encrypted file can't be copyright infringement because they didn't copyright the encrypted form"") or merely indignant. That's not to say a programmer can't be well-informed, but just that it's hubris to think that programming knowledge alone can give you some keen insight into the law without actually studying the law.<p>On the other hand, I definitely stop and read when I see something by, say, grellas  because I know what he'll have to say is very likely to be the result of study and careful analysis.<p>(And for the record, I don't pretend to know a lot about most aspects of the law.

I've tried to restrict my development and general Web usage to ~2 hours a day. I recall bumping into a colleague at around 3-4a.m. We had a smoke and then he got called away to do tech support on some web app he had been contractually obligated to support.<p>Given experiences like that, and my previous work schedule: In the meantime, I've played in the park; re-learned futball to where I can perform advanced, intensive dribbling; re-experienced my long distance running regimen with old friends; progressively mastered the track bike (in complex traffic scenarios, track standing, skid stops, heel stops, etc.); re-organized my thoughts in ordinary language philosophy, contemporary neuroscience, quantum mechanics, Wittgenstein and Spinoza; I've begun a semi-daily writing activity; longboarding; road tripping; skipping stones; befriending animals; etc.<p>These are the activities which contrast with $ pip install -r reqs.txt or reading another API or vim or bash scripting.<p>But what else have I noticed?<p>Daily I sit underneath the Texas sun, and watch. I watch people use these devices. I see IE everywhere and hours upon hours of people fumbling with that. Or texting. Playing some app or Twitter.<p>It's beautiful, as I sit under the sun, silent. It upsets me how so many able bodies opt for such narrowly prescribed lifestyle.<p>This argument often turns into ad hominem or red herring involving luddites, Amish, throwbacks, vintagers, etc..

And when SGI and Microsoft paniced when it got out, well it became a bludgeoning club which they used to bludgeon people they didn't like. And all of the efforts to make it a language for lots of purposes like C or C++ (when is the last time someone got sued by AT&T for making a C compiler?) got tossed into the bucket in the name of bludgeoning.<p>Bill Joy asserted for a while that the JVM would execute byte code (with the assistance of HotSpot and some other bit of secret sauce that never actually happened) faster than compiled native code. Later when gcj was released (Java to native machine code compiler) that code ran faster than hot spotted code, and it loaded quicker too.)<p>Google on the other hand knew it was leveraging something it had the code to (and like a third of the original team) and yet it often takes a very literal interpretation on license requirements when that interpretation suits them. An example of that was the lack of any requirement to put any of their changes to Linux back into the repo because they didn't ""ship"" Linux, they just used it in house. Now a number of engineers were very annoyed at maintaining things that they didn't want to maintain and that forced things to be pushed upstream but that was commit by pain, not commit by intent.<p>So I really resonate with the comment James made that there isn't anyone with clean hands in this fight.

My hand-wavy calculation to get to ""deaths per 100,000 per year is 29 fatalities / 554 people / 50 years * 100000 = 105/100K. (Previously I did it as 34 / 450 / 50 * 100000 =
151)<p>The numbers I'm computing are the effective deaths per 100,000 per year. That's different than the number you are calculating, which is the number of fatal launches per year, I think.",1335814243

The variable value of functions are kept on the stack and are used as arguments for other functions. One function affects another. Insisting that there are no variables and thus no side effects in FP is wishful thinking at best and crackpottery at worst.</i><p>The author is misunderstanding FP entirely; possibly due to FP zealots misunderstanding FP entirely.  The key to FP is not some abstract hand-wavy idea of ""stuff never changing"", which is the strawman on which he built this entire post.  It is referential transparency ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency_(computer_science)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency_(compu...</a> ).<p>Referential transparency is the notion that any given expression can be replaced with its value without changing the result of the program.  This property does wonders for formal verification since it allows programs to be broken into pieces for ease of verification (this is a <i>huge</i> win).<p>FP, by making all state explicit, trivially exhibits referential transparency (since the dependencies of an expression are syntactically present within it).  Imperative languages, by making state implicit, do not exhibit this property.<p>A study languages which exhibit referential transparency yet have state, such as Mercury or Flapjax, shows that state is not incompatible with referential transparency or functional programming in the manner the author believes.  A solid understanding of reduction-semantics such as that used by the lambda calculus would also help him form a more coherent argument (particularly the points about ""functions being variable"" don't make logical sense).",1335814215

Google has the final say over APIs which is a good thing - you don't want hardware vendors designing software APIs that work cross device - that is best left to people who know that sort of thing. And not having a sanctioned committee with varying interests wrangling each other and slowing down progress has also worked out well for Google and Android.",1335812564

If Google slimed Sun, what did Sun do to Harmony?<p>If the primary goal was compatibility, they should have worked with Apache on that. The license fees wouldn't have been a problem. If, on the other hand, the primary goal was controlling the single open source version of Java, you're going to have to expect non-""Java"" open source forks.<p>I'm not sure what Google ""sliming"" Sun has to do with the copyright or the patent case, though. Is he suggesting that he agrees that APIs are copyrightable? (you wouldn't even need a TCK in that world)",1335812516

3910820,story,,,4,0,aay4,"My ideas.txt",,"I've been sitting on these for a while and I doubt I'll be working on them anytime soon so I thought I'd share:<p>1) SMS ordering system for local cafes and restaurants. Give businesses the means to publish a simple menu and let registered customers order by SMS.  Delivery and payment details are held on file so only the menu items need to be sent by SMS.  Perfect for ordering lunch at work.<p>2) Live-sourcing. Connect via VoIP (twillio?) to experts who work under your instruction using google docs (or any app if using screen sharing). This is for people who know what they want but not how to create it e.g. business people who need PPT presentations. Could also work for lazy people - dictate that blog post or essay and watch the words appear on screen with near 100% accuracy.  More expensive than outsourcing but with virtually none of the problems you'd get on odesk, elance et al<p>3) group complaints/protests - like kickstarter for complaints. People can create complaints stating:<p>a) what the problem is
b) what they want done to fix it
c) the consequences if they don't. e.g. a boycott, twitter/phone/letter campaign, protest outside their HQ etc<p>Other consumers pledge their support and if the company fails to act, people take action together. Revenue comes from a small membership fee like meetup ($1 per protester ..?) or by allowing competitors of the target company to advertise on the protest page.<p>4) Volunteer dating - allow charities to host and publicize events where volunteers can help out one evening/afternoon. Singles in the area can register their interest and then go along to meet other singles at the event. No pressure, casual environment and a great way to meet new people.<p>5) Guess Who on facebook ... this has probably been done ... ?<p>6) Offline ad-network : match up people with interesting locations to display ads in the physical world with companies looking for unique advertising. You would only accept listings that have something unique/newsworthy about them.  As with all marketplaces, the difficulty here would be the chicken/egg problem but maybe you could use listings on the site to advertise the site ...?<p>7) creative quotes. Simple, web-based editor to let people create quotes like on reddit.com/r/quotesporn. Revenue from partnerships with cafepress or similar.<p>8) checklist marketplace. Checklists are very useful for reducing human error/capturing best practice.  You could create a marketplace where experts in particular fields publish lists of do's and dont's (along with explanatory notes) that can be sold as PDF's for a few dollars. The publishers get revenue, the readers get the benefit of years of experience and expert knowledge.<p>9) software for credit unions. I haven't investigated this one much but I met someone who ran a credit union that was complaining about how expensive/outdated all the existing software was (in the UK)<p>10) letsbuyit.com - it failed the first time round, but  people are now much more comfortable buying online.  Unlike the original, you wouldn't hold any stock/inventory. Simple negotiate and publish the deals, then let the consumers deal directly with the retailer.",1335812497

The author can then look over the history to see not only what the comments were, but exactly what each one means in the code. You're guaranteed that the problems are fixed, and (assuming the original programmer actually does look over the history) the learning value is much higher.<p>I've done exactly this on a couple of occasions and it worked very well.

It's a way for your app (via curl or any other http library) to ""connect"" to your http clients.<p>It has a few interesting options. ""messages"" are passed by a ""channel id"" and you can have any number of long polling listeners on a channel, or you can error out the first or last connections on a channel so there is only one listener at a time. If you have multiple listeners the message becomes a broadcast.<p>You also have a configurable amount of memory to buffer messages in the event there is no listener on a channel, or the listener is busy (receiving a message I guess). You can also set limits on number of messages per channel and a timeout.<p>I can see the advantages of this easily. The connections in nginx are much less resource intensive then a rails or php fast-cgi. You'll end up using much less ram. I know python has twisted and there are few others webservers for other languages, but this would allow me to run a php based chat server and take advantage of long polling.<p>I like it.",1255709654

Most of the rest are from people who just skipped straight to Java, or who are so young that they never had to learn C++ at all.<p>The comments that really drop my jaw are the people who seem to hold up Java as a ""better"" C++.  Java is okay, but from its sketchy real-world performance, to its crappy generic programming support and poor ability to enforce such type-safety basics as const-correctness, I've never been impressed.  Take the time to learn C++ for what it is, instead of ""C with objects"" and you'll find that it's far more elegant than the backlash would suggest.<p>I think that what most people really hate about C++ stems from the widespread use of legacy compilers that incorrectly implement the spec, or implement older versions of the spec.  This problem exists for every programming language in the universe (<i>e.g.</i> Ruby 1.8.6 vs. Ruby 1.8.7 vs. Ruby 1.9), but since C++ is widely implemented by <i>multiple vendors</i>, the problem appears worse.  If Python or Java were implemented by Microsoft and GNU and four other smaller companies, you'd see the same horrible compatibility problems with those languages, too.",1255709280

It's not taking off?!""  There's a lot to learn about where to put the ""pay wall"" with a freemium offering, how to get users to upgrade, how to optimize a public/brochureware site for paying conversion, etc.  With content sites, I imagine there's a lot to learn about selling ads, remnant ad space, ad networks, etc.<p>- Work on your public facing site a LOT.  And measure it.  In the early days, it's a constant salesperson for you.  We all remark on how bad/confusing sites are, but lots of us treat the brochureware part of our business as a red-headed stepchild.  After over a year of having a paid offering, we just redesigned our site and there was a 400%+ increase in conversion rate.  Thinking about the revenue ramifications if we'd done that a year ago (or even 6 months ago) makes me wince.  We were leaving lots of money on the table.<p>- Don't pitch big VCs unless you want big money.  They take LOTS of meetings to get to a yes/no and make very few investments.<p>- Focus on relationships when fundraising.  Almost every investor we got was through an introduction (social proof wins).<p>- How fast your site/app is is REALLY important.<p>- Focus on retention as a metric.  The compound interest effect of retention (or return visits if you're a content site) are HUGE.  Do the math.<p>- Keep your burn low and don't underestimate how long it takes to get to profitability.  We raised more than we wanted to and it turns out we needed it.<p>- Marketing/sales wins.  Almost always.  The quality of your product is a multiplier on the success of your business.  It's easier to build a great marketing engine on top of a great product than the inverse.  VERY VERY few businesses launch a product and ride word of mouth to greatness.<p>- PR isn't all that.

I can't really see this ruining anybody's life. 
It isn't letting me search for specific peoples comments. I don't know any of these people, nor am I likely to meet them.<p>This website reminds me of being outside, with people, and hearing little snippets of conversations from strangers. Nobody goes to a park and then complains the council that strangers where able to hear their conversations.<p>Hmmm, I hope this doesn't sound facetious. I feel like I'm missing the point with  the facebook privacy hype. There are so many reactions that seem totally strange from my perspective that I feel like I've got something wrong.<p>The way it sits in my mind is: 
Facebook is a service provided for free. 
I've given facebook some information about myself so that it can be displayed to people who are interested. 
My friends do the same and so we can communicate and share things such as photos. 
Some people start to get angry at the fact facebook doesn't do what they want, namely provide this service in a private manner.<p>I have yet to see anyone personally upset by this. Mostly people seem to disagree with the principle, and go and get angry on behalf of others.",1273794956

For news links, this will unlikely be the case unless you are actively attempting to create a news site where only a very few have power over what is shown and what is not.<p>Also, the Cloudmark technique chooses very few people to reward and this is on purpose. They are sparing with the reputation points and quick to downgrade on controversy in order to prevent a high-reputation individual gaming the system. Your news reputation system would likely have to incorporate a similar technique in order to be similarly robust. However, in doing so, I would imagine that most people would not see their reputation ever rise and would likely stop using the system. (due to lack of the ""incentives"" of which you speak) Cloudmark gets around this because people are already marking emails as spam or not in their email clients already, so there's no marginal cost associated with training Cloudmark's network or building their own reputation.<p>Its an interesting direction you propose, but I believe you'd be exposing your user base to scale-free network effects in which only a small few would gain sufficient reputation to ""move the needle"" and the rest would wallow in relative obscurity. This would then essentially replicate the Slashdot of 2000 AD but with the marketing message saying that it was ""fairer"" because of all the ""incentives"" people have.<p>You might want to think of how to structure a social news site as a kind of online auction, choosing a structure in which truth-telling is a dominant strategy, instead, such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey%E2%80%93Clarke%E2%80%93Groves_auction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey%E2%80%93Clarke%E2%80%93...</a>",1273794561

There are two possible choices he could have made:<p><i>Something shocking, like ""playing hooky"", that could get people in trouble. In this case, people will get in trouble, because someone will find out they were playing hooky and report them. However, because people are directly being effected, a shit-storm will be caused, and people will accept that this is a problem faster.<p></i> On the other hand, the examples could have been something trivial, such as ""Weight"". It may get people annoyed about it, but no one is going to lose their job. And since they won't lose their job, they won't be pissed, and Facebook can drag their feet.<p>The best part is, anyone with malicious intent could make these searches on their own.

Not just employee - Developer.<p>I read your blog post, and you make some very good points. I feel much the same about the industry as a whole, and became especially sensitive to it after attending FOWA Miami last year, and seeing the vast, vast difference in the number of women in attendance versus the number of men. At the after parties, I walked up to every woman I saw and asked them if they were programmers. I didn't find a a single one. They were all in marketing or design.<p>But here at Grooveshark? Yeah, so the ""that's what she said"" joke on our 404 page is inappropriate. But it's still pretty damn funny. Maybe I'm biased. I've heard ""that's what <i>he</i> said"" jokes thrown about the office as well. As a woman, I'm certainly in the minority of employees here at Grooveshark. But I am absolutely not dumped into any sort of Illustrator ghetto. In fact, I'm the lead ActionScript developer here. The actual Grooveshark application you use every day? Until the redesign, that was all me. It's gotten too large to be maintained by a single dev anymore, but I'm still the one who designs and writes all the application's architecture. I am not sexualized (at least no more than any of the men are) or vilified here. I am a valuable part of our team.<p>So yes, our industry has a serious problem. But don't think Grooveshark (or our 404 page) seriously contributes to it.",1273794487

Constitutionally, states must honor with ""full faith and credit"" other states' ""public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings"" (Article IV), so for the most part, a state government-issued identification card has the same authority as a federal-issued one, since each state is obligated to give it the same credence they would their own. (America's extreme form of federalism is to thank.) Although there are obviously instances where this isn't necessarily true, carrying a passport around along with a state ID would be redundant in most cases within the US -- even the TSA, for example, puts a state ID on the same level as a passport.<p>I know this wasn't REALLY the point of this article, but it did make me wonder about the constitutional/legal issues involved.",1273792801

Typically the community wants to have some visibility into the decision making process, and that simply isn't happening with the jvm imo.

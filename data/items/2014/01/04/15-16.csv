Front-end vs. Back-end, and yes, it is very common to split up work like that. I&#x27;ve never heard anybody describe &#x27;modules&#x27; as &#x27;models&#x27;,&#x27;views&#x27;,&#x27;urls&#x27;, etc. etc. though.<p>A back-end dev, team, or when doing back-end work, you&#x27;re focused on the server side architecture and code. That would include your models, views, controllers, routes, database, etc.<p>A front-end dev can then take these end-points (routes or URLS) and build the templates, and front-end experience (HTML, CSS, Javascript).<p>I think the problem you may be having is in how you&#x27;re defining what you&#x27;re working on. You say specifically &#x27;when we add a new table&#x27;, but a front-end guy isn&#x27;t going to know what to do with a &#x27;table&#x27;. That is back-end. Both teams should be focusing on the feature or capability you are providing, not the technical structure. So rather than saying to the front-end guy &#x27;we added a table and need a view into that table&#x27;, you may have more success saying &#x27;we want to show how weather patterns affect our shipping rates&#x27; or whatever it is the table does. Then the front-end guy can take your URL and from a user-perspective build a solution which solves the problem.<p>Another thing to consider is that design and user experience is not part of Front-end development. You may have a front-end dev who is good at UX and design, but if so, you&#x27;ll be very fortunate. Some Front-end devs can do design, but not all. So you may want to make sure that before the Front-end (or even Back-end) guys get coding, they have the design of what they are building. That may help both sides come to the best solution quickest.",1388851136

Conservatives would have never won in that situation, and that shows a huge problem in the system as-is.\nTo take a poor analogy it asks people what is there choice between 3 shades of blue, or bright red. Most people agree on blue, but they differ on which exact shade of it, and red end up being chosen. If you had given the choice between blue and red, blue would have won absolutely because people who votes blue 1 were still very much in favor of blue 2 or blue 3 if the alternative was red.<p>Anyway, good luck to my friends in Canada",1388849513

Some apps tie the networking stuff to the main run loop. You can see which apps do that by simply opening a context menu in the app somewhere or open a regular menu from the app&#x27;s main menu. The run loops will be &quot;halted&quot; for as long the menu is open and thus your networking will stop. As soon you dismiss the menu the networking will continue.<p>At first this may seem totally bullshitty: Imagine a download manager. Do you really want the download to pause every time you open a context menu? Well it turns out it is not such a bad idea in many cases: What if the context menu allows you to cancel the download? If the download were to go on in the background you would have to explicitly take care of that. If you tie the networking callbacks to your main runloop this simply can&#x27;t happen.<p>Of course there are also a lot of use cases where you want your networking code to not have anything to do with your main runloop...",1388848963

We use a freemium model and about 75% of our users use the free service to host their free events. This helps us because of #2 below.<p>2. Our built in viral mechanism is that when one hosts an event, everyone who signs up for an event sees a &quot;powered by eventwax&quot; logo at the bottom of the registration pages. So, even for free events, we are getting a tiny bit of passive exposure to all event&#x27;s audiences. That means 10&#x27;s of thousands of people a month see our logo.<p>3. We have a semi-active blog that brings in some high quality traffic.<p>4. We&#x27;ve had success at targeting a few keyword phrases that bring in a bit of traffic but SEO targeting has also been one of our biggest disappointments. Online event registration is a very competitive field and we&#x27;ve &quot;wasted&quot; a lot of time trying to improve our keywords.<p>5. We do run very limited Google Adwords and Linkedin PPC campaigns but haven&#x27;t optimized them yet. Our current combined budget is only about $100/month. The next think we need to do is &quot;bucket&quot; our keywords into semantic groups and then create custom landing pages for each group to increase relevancy.",1388847729

As in, <i>&quot;Oh they did a very thorough job of complying by our standards that we had no option but to restore their status&quot;</i>.<p>Unfortunately in this case Google&#x27;s response speed comes across as a bad thing.

I.e. a business is a lifestyle business as long as you are neither trying to be an acquisition target nor trying to build up to go public.<p>The point is that you don&#x27;t have the same kinds of relentless pressure in that environment that you do in a vc-backed start-up.

7011204,comment,7003627,7011154,0,0,walid,,,"In your first point you skip that the reason why Aaron was able to get into the system was that MIT was a breeding place for the hack culture and didn&#x27;t clamp down on security like keeping the door of the switches closet open and allowing highly privileged access to its network. If it was locked or entry was prohibited then it would have been outright against set rules. It wasn&#x27;t. This means according to MIT&#x27;s followed traditions he did what everyone else was capable of doing and it was not against the law because heavy use of the network and access to the switches room was allowed.<p>As for your second point it doesn&#x27;t hold. The kerfuffle around the NSA is partly because it was collecting data from the ISPs without a warrant and 4th amendment rights are being violated. In this case MIT is in the same position as the ISPs while not having immunity over their actions like ISPs did.",1388847617

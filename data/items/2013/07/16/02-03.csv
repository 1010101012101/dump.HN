6049806,comment,6048670,6049191,6,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">So instead of banning surveillance, which would be futile, it&#x27;ll be much more practical to call for transparency, so the power generated by surveillance data is not concentrated to the select few.<p>Transparency is necessary but not sufficient.<p>Being able to see the government taking bad risks doesn&#x27;t cut it if we can&#x27;t actually stop them. And the problem is that it&#x27;s not just the government and it&#x27;s not just our government. You can&#x27;t just come up with some restrictions on the FBI or the NSA (good luck with that anyway, and good luck enforcing it) while you ignore what China or large corporations might be doing.<p>Part of the answer to surveillance technology has to be anti-surveillance technology.<p>And I think one of the big things we need to push for is: We need more bandwidth. We need a national push for gigabit fiber to the home.<p>Copious transmission capacity attacks vulnerability to surveillance in two ways:<p>The first is that it reduces the practicality of storing all the data, by increasing the volume of data by an order of magnitude or more. We can price the spies out of the market.<p>The second is that it facilitates anti-surveillance technology. Tor is slow because it&#x27;s bandwidth starved. Most people have piss-poor uplinks which are a factor of ten or more slower than their downlinks, which becomes the bottleneck if those users were to operate a relay. We need to solve the bandwidth shortage to make widespread use of that sort of technology practical.",1373943573

This is never a nice pixel double or halving that OSX carries out, but always a blurry mess, scaling up or down.

So when a single name is added to a namespace at the beginning of the curve, that blob gets bigger, and every other blob moves 'right'. Once you stare at it a while, you can see that every blob moves along the same path, and it's slightly easier to see which blobs are growing and which are getting shoved. But I agree that it isn't easy, and I think it's because the CPAN Map wasn't meant to be time-lapsed like this.<p>Edit: if you go to the mapofcpan.org site and click on pixels, I think you'll figure out what the blue areas are.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve</a>",1350910635

So does my car have a tire tax, just because it comes with tires on it? If you're buying a PC, 99.99% of all people expect it to come with an OS. In fact, it's cheaper to buy a PC preloaded with Windows ($35) than it is to buy an unloaded PC and buy a copy of Windows ($150). There are major manufacturers making Linux PCs. There are major manufacturers that will sell you a box loaded with FreeDOS. There's even a major manufacturer that sells pre-installed, well-supported, and beautiful Unix PCs (I've heard they're one of the richest companies in the world). It's not like Microsoft is literally taxing computers, they're charging an incredibly small amount of money and in return you're getting their OS preinstalled like most of the market wants.<p>Can we get over the Windows Tax thing? It's pretty much akin to saying Micro$oft. Funny in middle school, but it makes your argument much less attractive now.",1350910599

There are big discussions in those circles about the meaning of the verbs ""to buy"" and ""to possess"" as used by Amazon, Apple and other big DRM ""retailers"". It is not only about DRM. Libraries are realising that paying for access to a website of a publishing house is not exactly like paying to receive a copy of a published journal or magazine. Have a look at all the dark archives and to who is financing them.<p>First it was an hacker problem, now it has spread to humanities, in five years the DRM will finally become a layperson problem.

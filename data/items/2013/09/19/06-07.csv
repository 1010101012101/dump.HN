6410253,comment,6410067,6410231,1,0,RyanZAG,,,"I get that - but the usual implementation would be to have a set of databases with indexes (maybe mysql or mongodb) where you could store all the data and run ad-hoc queries against. You&#x27;d then put memcache in front of that for fast access to repeated queries where you already know which data you want. If the data isn&#x27;t in the memcache, it would fall through to the underlying DB that is already on disk.<p>zBase would have it&#x27;s own full copy of the data already on distributed disks, so it wouldn&#x27;t need to fall through to some other database. That seems to be the entire point there - but surely you&#x27;d still need to store the data in some place you could run ad-hoc queries on it? That means that the data is duplicated into two places that would need to be kept up to date in sync. If a transaction fails on one of the data stores, don&#x27;t you have inconsistent data now?",1379573877

You guys are thinking in completely wrong terms by worrying about countermeasures. You could create 10 grenade-wielding UAVs, set them for a pre-programmed course above the crowd, out of reach of everyone, and set them off almost immediately. Water cannons, oil cannons or any other countermeasure would be useless. This attack is dirt cheap, incredibly destructive and you don&#x27;t even need a depressed individual to commit suicide to do it. It could be run from any outside location within a couple of kilometers from the target.<p>The <i>only</i> long-term solution against terrorism is to just make sure that people&#x27;s options in society are good enough that they won&#x27;t resort to blowing things up. This is also the only sustainable way of fighting crime, which any reasonable study will show you.<p>I&#x27;m from Norway, we recently had a terrorist attack that was bigger than 9/11 in relation to our population size.

Wiki mentions the tricks learnt from GTAIV were exploited to their full extent to make the best use of the hardware for GTAV.<p>> While both games were developed for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, the team were able to render the world of Grand Theft Auto V with greater detail than in Grand Theft Auto IV because they had become familiar with the hardware over time. Art director Aaron Garbut opined that while the aging hardware of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were tiring to work with, &quot;I think one of the most amazing features is the way we handle lighting in the game to maintain a consistent look despite the constraints on realistic lighting and shadows on current hardware&quot;, he explained.[28] Vice president Dan Houser agreed with this sentiment, explaining that working on Grand Theft Auto IV with relatively new hardware was difficult, but &quot;now we know what the hardware&#x27;s capable of, so it&#x27;s become a lot easier to move things along and a lot more fun, too&quot;.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gta5#Development"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gta5#Development</a>",1379573245

You can see similar life expectancy graphs in several animal species. Basically, once you reach a certain age, you have a high probability of living up to a decently high age.<p>Regarding &quot;Medicine, sanitation, pooping indoors&quot;, well, all of these became problems because of the Agricultural Revolution, where people lived in densely populated areas together with their domesticated animals. Diseases slowly spread from the animals to the humans, and the density and lack of sanitization increased mortality by helping disease spread quickly. The Agricultural Revolution also forced humans to do back breaking jobs for which our bodies were not built for (working hunched over in the fields, or carrying heavy weights on our backs), and shrunk our varied diet into mostly eating grains and grain-based foods.<p>So I think you should probably re-think your poor view of hunter-gatherer societies.",1379571892

6410121,comment,6409529,6409899,2,0,rwg,,,"First off, you&#x27;re absolutely right.  The difference in IPC between a modern CPU and a 2002 vintage Pentium 4 is pretty incredible, and the way forward is all about power efficiency and cramming more cores onto one die.<p>However, I think it&#x27;s unfair to say clock speed is an unfortunate marketing gimmick &quot;anymore&quot; when it was a gimmick all the way back in 2002 when Intel released the 3.06 GHz &quot;Northwood&quot; Pentium 4 that the OP&#x27;s linked article references.  In fact, it was a gimmick that caused one of the biggest strategy/roadmap blunders Intel ever made.<p>Intel designed NetBurst (the architecture that the P4 was based on) to do one thing <i>really</i> well: allow Intel to ramp up clock speeds quickly.  The architectural choices they made to enable this severely hobbled the P4&#x27;s performance, especially the 20 (later 31!) stage pipeline that made the penalty for branch mispredictions pretty awful.<p>Intel eventually released P4s that clocked as high as 3.8 GHz and had an unheard of (in the x86 space) 115 watt TDP, but when the Athlon 64 was released, AMD could smoke Intel&#x27;s fastest P4s using slower clocked CPUs with lower TDPs.  Instead of focusing on raw clock speed, AMD focused on architectural improvements like x86-64, HyperTransport, and an integrated memory controller.  (Intel CPUs wouldn&#x27;t see QPI or an integrated memory controller until Nehalem, released five years after the first Athlon 64.)<p>As you say, the tables are now turned  clock for clock, the IPC of AMD&#x27;s Piledriver core is behind that of even Intel&#x27;s (two generations old) Sandy Bridge core, and all AMD seems to be able to do is add more cores and crank up the clock speed.  Unfortunately for AMD, adding more cores doesn&#x27;t help single-threaded performance, and a very nasty side-effect of increasing clock speed is that the processor&#x27;s TDP increases disproportionately: the 4.7 GHz FX-9590 has a whopping 220 watt TDP, while the 4.0 GHz FX-8350&#x27;s TDP is 125 watts.",1379570988

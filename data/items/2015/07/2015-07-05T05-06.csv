I would bet that these rural areas have power and phone (maybe even cable, too) provisioned via poles and thus stringing the fiber along the poles would be the approach I would take,<p>Well, as they say, it depends. Purely on it&#x27;s own aerial fiber is often cheaper than buried fiber to install. However the aerial plant is more exposed (both in good and bad), so lifetime costs depend on the location. The biggest issue is however access to poles and specifically at what cost. Pole fees and make ready work can easily push costs above direct burial costs, if there are no land usage fees and you can bury the fiber by plowing.<p>> barring some fantastic reason why that wouldn&#x27;t work [copper handles high winds better? icing? who knows].<p>No need to go all fancy.

American manufacturing has only increased almost every decade since WWII.  There has not been a decrease.  What HAS decreased is employment in manufacturing.

Optimistic updating is definitely the biggest and most challenging feature on my roadmap. I figured I&#x27;d save it until last so that by the time I start working on it some of those kinks would be figured out :) but I&#x27;m going to take a close look at the blocking issues.<p>Even when those RethinkDB issues get resolved, I still have some conceptual questions understanding how to make arbitrary queries update optimistically. For example, say that I&#x27;m subscribed to:<p><pre><code>  r.table(&#x27;proposals&#x27;).pluck(&#x27;name&#x27;)
</code></pre>
And I issue the following update:<p><pre><code>  r.table(&#x27;proposals&#x27;).filter(r.row(&#x27;votes&#x27;).eq(0)).delete()
</code></pre>
On the client side, because I used the pluck(&#x27;name&#x27;) operation in the subscription query, we can&#x27;t possibly know which rows to optimistically delete since we didn&#x27;t download the &#x27;votes&#x27; field.<p>Do you know how this issue is addressed in meteor?

The human imagination is as capable of dreaming up impossibilities as it is incapable of dreaming up the way the universe actually is, and math helps us avoid doing the former while we use systematic observation, controlled experiment and Bayesian inference to figure out the latter.<p>Because &quot;thinking about the mathematical representation of physical reality&quot; is such a profoundly unnatural, unintuitive act, and because the math is so strict and simple, it is very hard to for us to use it to imagine impossibilities, whereas if you have a conversation with a layperson you will find they almost instantly run off the rails into nonsense because they don&#x27;t have the math to keep them on track.

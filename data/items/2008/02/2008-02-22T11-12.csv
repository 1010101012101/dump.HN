Predictably, the people who worked the hardest didn't have time to create a FaceBook account. So, every other member of the mailing list was a member of FaceBook and didn't want be on the outside of this group.",1203681428

121205,comment,121194,121194,0,0,tomh,,,"Hard choice.  One other factor you didn't mention about is community.  In releasing your code to a wider audience, you are trying to create a community around your code.  Community requires support; a wiki/bug-tracker to post problems and solutions, a mailing-list to support conversations and questions, a robust source control server to host your code, and a understandable release process to push out new versions.<p>Also, you will need to write a lot of documentation about your code, how to install, how to extend, etc.  You will probably want to write a FAQ first to fend off first-time newbie questions about installation, management, etc.<p>You will also have to make conscientious decisions about what versions your software will run on, and which requests you will support -- we run a stack on Tomcat 5.5 with Java 5, for example, but we have gotten X amount of questions about support for Java 6, JBoss, JRun, etc etc etc.<p>My two cents: it's rough to get other people involved.  The good karma for open-sourcing can be more trouble if you are not organized about how to handle and attract new members to your project.",1203680775
121204,comment,121194,121194,0,0,davidw,,,"How's it different/better than something like OFBiz or one of the other open source systems?  What's your edge over all the other project management things out there?<p>With open source, you're essentially foregoing any revenue from licensing in the hope that you'll make money consulting, unless you do something like have a GPL library where people will pay to be able to link to it in proprietary apps.<p>I'm not entirely convinced that the world needs yet another project management thing.  I think it had either be really good and far better than what's out there now, in which case you can charge for it, or... perhaps another direction is best?<p>PS: YC's formatting isn't very advanced.",1203680331

121201,comment,121137,121137,0,0,duncanr,,,"The kids in the post add value by building more complex structures out of the raw materials, no? Does the author of the article think we have an infinite supply of raw materials? I read the original article as an experiment into control of raw materials rather than an experiment of added value vs. zero-sum.<p>As much as economists may dislike it, these arguments seem to always boil down to 'who has control of the raw materials'; those that are empowered are happy with the current system, and those that are not empowered are not. The efficiencies of the market, and whether it's zero-sum or not, would seem to be a secondary concern for most participants.",1203680123

Those who are a bit more cynical/nihilistic tend to go into finance or start their own companies.<p>The old advice ""do not make any gods to be alongside me"" is still relevant except for the ""alongside me"" part, which probably only has any meaning if you consider yourself religious.

My intro courses, IIRC ""intro to CS"" and ""algos & data structures"" were Ada. 2nd year Software Engineering was Java. I think students starting Fall of 2002 had an entirely Java curriculum. At the time I was kind of annoyed to be learning Ada rather than Java, especially because the faculty member who wrote the assigned Ada textbook couldn't be bothered to actually teach the course. However, looking back on it I think Ada is a better language for learning than Java because everything is so explicit. I still have Ada on my resume, mostly for shits and giggles.

2592719,comment,2592693,2592693,15,0,jmtame,,,"The announcement they make in a few weeks is going to be huge and disruptive. Some interesting bits from the interview in <i>Startups Open Sourced</i>:<p><i>Q: Tell me what your experience was like raising money. Was that positive or negative?</i><p>That experience sucked, and I'm still in that process. It's a lot better now but it still sucks. It's still very taxing.<p>When we went to raise before, we were six months after the recession which meant that it was very hard to raise from anybody because they were being super cautious. Sequoia did this ""RIP"" slide thing. It was challenging, and so it sucked because you just got a lot of ""no's."" We were two kids from ASU, never done a company, had never worked anywhere really interesting. We had nothing going for us other than that we were in YC. So raising sucked; we almost died actually. We were probably a week from just dying, thinking ""Oh guess we're going to go back to school."" I was like, ""Tim, if you ever want to build anything, build it now. We might not be alive in the next month, so just build it now."" And we actually ended up raising from Max Levchin and Michael Birch at the last second, and that saved us. We were like, ""Oh, we finally did it, we raised."" But raising was just taxing because you end up talking to VC's who have a million reasons why your idea sucks, won't work, and then you talk to angels who won't invest in you until some other angel invests in you. You have this chicken and egg problem.<p><i>Q: Sequoia's leaked RIP slides happened October 2008, and we were in the same YC class which was Summer 2009, so the summer right after. People may forget but it was actually kind of a challenging economical environment.</i><p>Yeah. I think the companies that raised--you had to be pretty decent if you raised. I think we were more lucky than decent.<p><i>Q: Any points where you thought Mixpanel would fail or where you really had stressful moments?</i><p>Yeah. It happened two weeks ago. It happens a lot. Basically when you're doing real-time data analysis, the problem is that you have to pre-compute everything. You have to do it all right when the data comes which means that if you don't scale the rate at which the data is coming in you start to get backlogged. You just have data that's piling up over time and so we definitely had scenarios where we were not real time, we had 24 hour, 48 hour, 72 hour delays for two weeks, and there are definitely points in times where the scaling problems were so bad that I would just lay on the ground and think ""How am I going to scale this? How am I going to do this?"" And the thing is, if you can't, you die.<p><i>Q: I remember the delays in Mixpanel's early days.</i><p>Yeah, things like that still happen even today, but they're less severe. We have a better handle on it obviously, but there were definitely days where things just got really, really bad, and if you can't scale you just lose.",1306523915

So if you have safari but if you are not using it (for whatever reason) then you should not be calc as a part of market share. Just by forcing users to download your s/w doesn't increase the market share in reality. It would be interesting to know about popular browser within tech community and why (technically and by usability)?",1209826753

Having an option and using that option is 2 different thing.",1209826100

I make sure I go through the same morning ritual as I would if I were to go to a real office.  Take a shower, get dressed and eat breakfast before even thinking about reading email.  By that time I should be good to go.  If you still can't get going then starting off on something you really want to do than something that is just work is a good way to get going too.",1209825862

I predict that new-style AI will solve a few of the ""dumb"" things that people do, such as keeping our balance and getting a visual sense of our 3d location and orientation.<p>The difficult part will continue to be those areas where we're not just doing combinatorics and we're not just doing statistics. The meaning of a sentence is formed both by the grammar, which is nearly combinatorial, and by the meanings and connotations of the words used, which are hardly combinatorial at all. I doubt that this sort of thing will just fall out from bayesian networks, or from any simple development based on bayesian networks.",1209825023

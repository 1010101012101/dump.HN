3016208,comment,3015326,3016158,6,0,guygurari,,,"Religion is wrong in the sense that it is based on incorrect assumptions, namely that God exists. This is not a moral statement. Whether or not it is harmful is to be decided by the evidence (many terrorists are religiously-motivated etc.), and I agree this point is harder to establish, because religion also brings comfort and so on. Anyway for Dawkins this issue seems secondary to the first one.<p>As for your second paragraph, but of course this is advocacy! Dawkins is not acting as a scientist here, I think this much is clear. He is an advocate who draws on his scientific knowledge and his rational philosophy to make his case.",1316491143

I'll repeat that I think you're missing the point.<p>The offensive part about religious fundamentalism isn't stubbornness or denial of respect. These are corollaries to dogmatic thinking, but not its defining features. Positions rooted in science are by definition not dogmatic and therefore cannot be fundamentalist. Lack of respect for differences of opinion is indeed a shared trait between Richard Dawkins' views and those of fundamentalists, but that's a rather trivial similarity. At their core, they are philosophical and moral opposites.<p>Consider as an analogy what would happen if I had a difference of opinion with my doctor about what my illness is that was completely counter to the best information available through examinations and tests. My doctor wouldn't be stubborn or dogmatic for considering me an idiot in that instance. My opinion has no value and therefore is owed no respect.",1316490967

3016179,comment,3015158,3015552,1,0,kragen,,,"There are some similarities. One relevant difference is that the GreenArrays GA144 has 144 CPUs on one chip, not just 48.  Another relevant difference is that the GA144 uses up to 200 milliwatts, not up to 125 watts.  A third relevant difference is that the Intel chip can run existing software, while the GreenArrays chip needs software to be written specially for it.  In large part, this is because the Intel chip has 296 kilobytes of RAM per core, while the GA144 has 64 18-bit words of RAM per core (1152 bits, 144 bytes).<p>The communications infrastructure is also different.  The cores on the GA144 are directly coupled to adjacent cores on the chip, so if you want to route messages, you need to devote some of your cores to routing. The Intel chip instead has a router attached to each pair of cores.<p>I don't think you'll ever see Go running on an F18A core like the GA144's.

Requests to the logged-in SSL site are made by injected Javascript in a separate non-SSL page.  By changing the length of the requested URL (easily done by appending GET variables), the authentication cookie header is pushed out so that the first unknown character is right at the end of a cipher block.  This allows us to make guesses at that character, testing each guess using the method described by Wei Dai in the linked email (using another crafted request to the server).

The thing that makes me anxious is worrying that I won't get any thoughtful responses, and therefore won't have anything worthwhile to think about or wrestle with.  So, thank you for keeping up on this.<p>> <i>""your other point that groups that do terrible things are not Christians""</i>
> <i>""there is actually additional criteria that you are applying to the term that wasn't there before.""</i><p>That's an inaccurate characterization of my point.<p>The label ""Christian"" has been in use for nearly 2000 years (it appears in its Greek and Latin forms in the Bible and other contemporary writings.)  For a person to be ""Christian"", they must be transformed by Christ and therefore must show some of the characteristics of being Christ's disciple.  This isn't new content I'm adding; this is all stuff that's talked about in the Bible (I think it's reasonable to consider the Bible authoritative on the subject.)<p>Now, it's certainly possible for a Christian to be a ""work in progress"", who shows some signs of transformation in some areas but is severely lacking in others, and who therefore does certain terrible and not-Christ-like things on occasion.  But if a person is all terrible, all the time, with no evidence whatsoever of any transformation, they are not Christian (regardless of whether they claim the label.)  The Bible talks about this, too -- 2 Peter 2, 2 Corinthians 10-12, and the entire book of Jude argue about those who masquerade as apostles of Christ, but aren't really.  It is not a new thing for some people to claim the label but be undeserving of it, and it is not a fallacy to point it out when it happens!<p>> <i>""the types of claims you and your wife are referring to do merit the same status as out of body experiences.""</i>
> <i>""I don't really know how it relates to evidence""</i><p>Everything is a form of evidence, including experience.  It's all subject to certain forms of scrutiny and certain criteria; how well it holds up determines how strong it is as evidence.  Some criteria include the accuracy/credibility of the source (is this person a known liar?  Is the lab equipment flaky?), the external verifiability or correctness of the data, the detail with which it is measured and recorded, and so on.<p>Expereince, both personal and other, can be strong evidence or weak evidence.  The only people I've ever heard speaking of UFO abductions have seemed non-credible in other ways, and as such, I consider their reports to be very weak evidence.  I've also heard of out-of-body experiences that are vague and don't connect to anything external (""I saw a tunnel and heard a voice mumbling about how it wasn't my time yet""), which are not particularly useful evidence.<p>I've also heard of more detailed out-of-body experiences where people are able to describe things, in detail, that were happening outside of their immediate vicinity.  That's a fairly strong type of evidence because it connects back to something external.  Similarly, the experiences I described all connect back to something tangible, and all come from people I know to otherwise be credible, and I therefore consider them strong evidence (but since you don't know either them or me to be credible, you have the option to discard them as weak evidence.)<p>Given the consistent impressiveness of these experiences, I find them hard to discount; brain malleability, white noise, hallucinations, and ghosts are all woefully inadequate explanations.  The only conclusion I can draw is that some intelligence is communicating information with us; I am content to label that intelligence ""Yahweh"" until it gives me reason to refer to it differently.<p>> <i>""how absurd it is to think that there is a majority group of Christians out there who want to rationally talk about their beliefs and in any way have them challenged""</i><p>This is an unfortunate result of living in a place where the loudmouthed anti-intellectual branch of Christianity is most prevalent.  All I can say is that it's not like that everywhere, hasn't been like that for most of history, and <i>definitely</i> isn't like that among theologians.<p>> <i>""I am of the opinion that the evidence will lead you away from sources that claim to know about the unknowable""</i><p>I am of the opinion that most of the things being discussed are not ""unknowable"".  They may be difficult to constrain to a lab, but they can be understood to some degree.<p>I am also of the opinion that evidence will lead you to wherever the evidence leads, as long as you're willing to follow it.  It is intellectually lazy to decide, before looking at the evidence, that it will lead you in some specific direction.  Dove and I have looked at a lot of evidence, and ended up where we are right now; do not be too quick to discount that.<p>When it comes to the history and translation process of the Bible, it's clear you haven't really studied the evidence; it appears you've simply adopted common opinions that conform to your worldview, which themselves come from people who haven't really looked at the evidence (you don't need to read biased Christian sites to get the other side; Wikipedia provides a nice, neutral look at these topics.)<p>For example, your <i>""copies of copies of translations of copies""</i> comment is an oft-repeated but factually incorrect meme; you would be well served to read about the topic of ""textual criticism"", and read the introductory page in various Bibles where they describe their own translation process.<p>Likewise, you stated (in question form) <i>""different Christian denominations have many different versions of the Bible that include and cut out passages""</i>.  Aside from a few cult groups, I'm not aware of any denomination that has its own version of the Bible.  I've seen a good mix of translations in Catholic, Baptist, Mennonite, and non-denominational churches.  The difference between the translations is primarily linguistic philosophy -- the reading level they target, whether they focus on word-for-word [1] or phrase-for-phrase translation, how they handle idioms, etc.<p>Regarding passages that have been ""cut out"", this goes back to textual criticism; any decent article on the subject will discuss the end of Mark, Luke 22:43-44, John 8, and 1 John 5:7-8.  (The NET Bible, available at net.bible.org, has extensive text-critical notes on each of these passages as well.)  It's not as though each individual denomination cuts out passages that don't suit them; rather, when the manuscript evidence shows a passage was likely added later, it's put in brackets with a note that says ""this probably wasn't original"".<p>Again, you stated (in question form) <i>""the Bible was started many many years after the mericals from Jesus""</i>.  We have copies of the Old Testament that are older than Jesus; this is not at all in doubt.  The evidence points toward the New Testament writings originating between 50 and 70 AD.  Notably, none mention the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem, which is kind of a big deal.  Even ignoring this, many parts of the NT are quoted in letters by Clement of Rome (95 AD) and Polycarp (120 AD), and some fragments from Polycarp's era still exist in museum collections (look up Papyrus 52).  This puts the writings within a generation of Jesus' death.<p>Regardless of what you think of the value or truthfulness of the Bible, the evidence is clear when it comes to its origins and content.<p>[0] also, Minecraft 1.8 just came out, which has made me even slower to respond.

One lesson of history is to gain deeper understanding of human nature. That is a big key to understanding politics in any age. Plenty of people become adept at politics knowing nothing of history. Another lesson of history is to understand the balance between conservatism and progressivism. Birds need left wings and right wings to fly. Healthy societies need conservatives and progressives, but the so-called left/right dynamic is only the most apparent dynamic in politics, the one with the most entertainment value; and so the entertainment industry exploits it and ends up devolving  political discourse. Think of the carnival side-show 3 shell game. The shells moving around and the banter between the con-man and the shills distracts everyone and provides entertainment. Where the ball ends up is the libertarian/authoritarian dynamic of politics. Most people don't have a clue, but if you have gained understanding from history (which requires studying a balance of sources) you see it. History is only one course of study to gain understanding of human nature and balance.",1316487728

There is nothing fundamental about the views of this subset of Christians.  The term is pure marketing, wild enough for good TV and, thus, wild enough to acquire impressionable followers, and the beliefs are not fundamental.<p>I see the stance against evolution as just a form of We vs They, a political tool more than religious, unnecessary for Christianity at large, and damaging to the religion in the long run if it persists.  I have seen it create stupidity in otherwise fairly intelligent individuals because they want to be seen as part of the group, not ostracized from their equally-susceptible peers.  For similar reasons, I have had friends reject the religion entirely, as they do not want to be a part of this insanity.  As for me, it is another nail in the coffin of my interest in the organization aspects.",1316487726

Granted, it's far easier to find people who are good at some tasks than others, but the list of ""difficult to find"" skillsets isn't as focused in the tech industry as you might believe.<p>Case in point. My father has run his own lawn & landscape company for the last 15 years or so. In that time, he's discovered that it's actually really difficult to find people who are good at that job. That job being running a lawn mower, weed-whacker, and hedge trimmer. I'm a determined individual. I consider myself up to any challenge, but on my best day, one of his crewmen is worth two and a half of me in the field.<p>After the Florida hurricanes in 2005, I worked with my father's business for about a week in an effort to help them catch up. Two Guatemalan men on the crew called me ""el burro"", because while I wasn't much good at anything else, I'd pick up and drag tarp after tarp full of debris back to the trailer without question. They were half making-fun, and half serious. I ended up gaining their respect, but I'd have received my pink slip after three days if I were a hired hand.<p>I've taken the long way around to get to my point. From the businessman's perspective, most programmers we deal with suck pretty hard too. Care to know how many developers I've wasted time on, only to find out that they didn't know what they were doing, or were incapable of meeting me half-way in understanding a project?<p>Some will be quick to point the finger at me for having a loose spec, or allowing scope creep, or failing to understand the technical challenges. I'll be quick to point to the fact that I have a great network of talented, motivated programmers who jump at the chance to work with me.<p>I'm not asking you to talk to bullshit entrepreneurs who can't walk the walk, but I am asking you to set aside that chip on your shoulder until you take the time to know the difference.",1316487678

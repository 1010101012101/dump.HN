But it is useful to people who don't need much security.  I understand that many people just use it for text-based chat and things like that.  Also, some people will subscribe because, although it's insecure, it's a better choice than flying home half way through their holiday....",1200699493

If it is smart (and it is), it invests the dollars it is hoarding in US Bonds or some other very safe vehicle (US Bonds might as well be bulletproof, short of WWIII). The problem is that even though China is investing in dollar-assets, this isn't counted in the silly trade deficit figures.",1200699068
100602,comment,100190,100343,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"<i>Instead of sending back those dollars to us and receiving goods from us, they would stuff them under a mattress</i><p>Usually they take the cash and invest it in US Government Bonds or private stocks and bonds. This high demand for bonds means our government can offer them at really low rates, and there are still takers. (China has something like $300 billion of US Bonds.) This is an added bonus for us. In this way, our currency's primary status is kind of self-perpetuating. Our currency is backed in faith in the solvency of the US Government, and our Government can borrow money really really cheaply to deal with any crisis it needs to, keeping it solvent where other governments would fail.<p>(For anyone out there that is scared what will happen if the rest of the world started dumping it's dollar-back assets, remember that less than half of the 'National Debt' is owed to foreigners, and many of these countries use dollars to stabilize their own currencies, so this would amount to financial suicide for them.)",1200698640

100588,comment,100497,100577,0,0,sethjohn,,,"So lets assume that the costs for a successful web company are a small fraction of revenue (maybe 20%?). That's profits of 100 million a year for last-year's-Facebook.<p>So if this company makes 1/10th the profits of Facebook, it will take 50 years to make enough profits to cover it's current valuation. Of course, if this company is as profitable as last-year's-Facebook then their total profits will exceed their valuation after 5 years.<p>So I guess the question then is whether social-networking apps have the potential to generate similar revenues to the big social networking sites.",1200697809

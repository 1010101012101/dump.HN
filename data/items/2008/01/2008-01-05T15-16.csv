Some of the most innovative mathematicians have been Indian, whereas I don't know of any such Chinese innovators.<p>While industrialization is very important for turning good ideas into products; the good ideas, in my mind, are more important.  As Al Queda is showing us, technology isn't the panacea we often think it is.",1199548526

But then again, that's when you as a voter get to weight these things as you'd like when choosing a candidate you'll support.

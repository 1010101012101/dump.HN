9818061,comment,9817295,9817829,0,0,veidr,,,"Yes, basically I do mean that. It&#x27;s not exactly that I gave him an iPad as an experiment, but the times he somehow got an iPad I &#x27;experimented&#x27; with not taking it away.<p>Eventually, I felt like I should take it away, though. (And I did.) The reasons basically boiled down -- as much of being a parent does -- to gut feeling. The way he played with most iPad apps didn&#x27;t seem healthy. He plays with blocks, builds a tower, it falls down... sometimes he is upset about that, sometimes he laughs. But his experiments with blocks and trains somehow lacked this <i>obsessive</i> quality.<p>I mentioned it in my reply to jasonkester elsewhere in this thread, but I felt like he was a kitten and the iPad was a laser pointer. He couldn&#x27;t/wouldn&#x27;t stop himself from using it, even when it was obvious that it had passed the point of being fun and became this frustrating, negative experience.<p>At such a young age, under two, the brain really is working on the basics. Weight. Gravity. Hard. Soft. Big. Small. Etc.<p>As he has grown, some of the things he can do with the iPad are getting pretty neat (painting, music, etc) and he does get a little bit of (supervised) iPad time now.<p>It&#x27;s hard to say at this stage, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if we let him do iPad for an hour a day (or an hour or two every few days) by the time he is say, four. It depends on what we see him doing with it, and how observing that makes us feel as parents.<p>I&#x27;m just speaking from my experience here, because I am not an expert on brain development and things like that. But I do really think there is a qualitative difference between e.g., physical wooden blocks and blocks on a screen. In general, younger than two just seems self-evidently too young.",1435834526

9818057,comment,9817209,9817906,0,0,TeMPOraL,,,"Often benefits put you in a situation where it makes no economical sense to pursue a job. I have a friend who lost her mother and had a pension that would be taken away if she got employed, but the pension itself was much bigger than she could ever dream of earning at that time (hell, it was bigger than I was earning in my first two programming jobs). So there&#x27;s your incentive to go and get employed.<p>Or another example; until not so long ago, my mother (single parent) got social benefits that would disappear if my own personal income would exceed a particular (not very big) amount, and this would turn into a problem with paying rent and feeding her and my siblings. She also spent some time unemployed after a company she worked in went bust (the original owner died, and his son mismanaged it into the ground), because all jobs available for her wouldn&#x27;t even pay enough to cover the lost benefits.<p>Basically, living at the lower end of income spectrum is incredibly hard, and you end up doing a lot of weird calculations. When working hard for 8+ hours a day pays you less than not working at all (and caring about your kids instead), suddenly this &quot;laziness&quot; becomes a perfectly rational choice.",1435834462

9817991,comment,9817295,9817853,0,0,veidr,,,"Yeah, good point. It annoys me any time this topic comes up (which is fairly often in my life, since I recently had kids) that I don&#x27;t have a better set of references to back me up.<p>It was decades ago that I studied journalism in college, and I can&#x27;t find links to a lot of what I learned, including the deleterious influence of television on human development (especially children).<p>Today, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends[1], &quot;Television and other entertainment media should be avoided for infants and children under age 2.&quot; We have pediatric doctors like Dr. Dimitri Christakis doing interesting research to help demonstrate the harms[2].<p>But I don&#x27;t have much time to really follow it these days (aforementioned young kids and all...). At the same time, when I hear &quot;show me the evidence! there&#x27;s no proof TV is harmful to 2-year olds!&quot; it really bugs me. (Not implying that&#x27;s what you are saying, it&#x27;s jut something I hear a lot.)<p>It&#x27;s like one of those &quot;there&#x27;s no proof dogs have emotions!&quot; things. It&#x27;s obvious when you watch little kids with TV and heavy and mostly-unrestricted iPad/Nintendo. It&#x27;s obvious that is not how you should do it (very much). I can&#x27;t <i>prove</i> it, but I am certainly going to act on that conclusion with my own kids.<p>So, to answer your question, the reason I deny my 2-year-old TV and unsupervised iPad use is because I have observed it in him, and observed it in his peers, and it&#x27;s just my best judgement that it is better off waiting until later.<p><i>Example 1</i>: One morning I came downstairs and he was watching TV. He had turned it on by himself; it was an unusual morning in that my wife and I both slept in. He was just sitting there, in a kind of stupor, staring motionless at the TV with a kind of slack jawed empty expression (like my own, probably, when I drink beer and watch True Detective after everybody is in bed). I walked in and he didn&#x27;t even respond. (The show was roughly the Japanese equivalent of Sesame Street.) I cleared my throat. No response. I grabbed the remote, and jokingly pointed it him from behind (the joke was for my wife, who had just walked in also). With the <i>click!</i> of the TV going off, my son immediately stood up, looked around, and busied himself with his Brio train set (which is what he usually did in the morning at that age (right around 2)). It appeared as if I had used the remote to turn him <i>on</i>.<p><i>Example 2</i>: We experimented with letting him have limited access to Mom&#x27;s iPhone, especially she started nursing our second child. For the usual reason -- it made him a lot easier to deal with while Mom did an unrelated but important task. He did these little &#x27;educational&#x27; games where you build a train track and then the trains run on it, and you have to build around obstacles, etc. But we soon noticed that when we would take the iPhone back, he would have a <i>very</i> violent negative reaction -- really unlike him, we felt. All kids have tantrums and taking away a toy is always a risk of creating a situation, but we both felt that his behavior seemed unhealthy in some way; to exaggerate a little, it seemed like he was addicted to the little game. In that same vein, when we let him do it for as long as he liked, he would keep doing it over and over until he worked himself into a similar state. E.g., after an hour of doing it he would get so frustrated by the train track building not going well that he would have a similar tantrum of screaming and being very upset. He had this same kind of frustration with the real laws of the physical world, too -- like the wooden block too big for the hole he was trying to fit it in -- but those moments seemed much more short-lived than the iPhone-related ones. (And it wasn&#x27;t just games -- interacting with the OS itself (dragging apps around, opening things to see what they did) seemed fascinating to him, but also seemed like a laser-pointer-and-kitten thing where he would get too worked up and couldn&#x27;t stop himself.)<p><i>Example 3</i>: My friends who disagree with me about this and let their 3-year olds watch TV hours every day have more annoying and obnoxious kids than those who don&#x27;t. ;-) Bad impulse control, lower ability to accept and move on when things don&#x27;t go their way, etc.<p>Also, I should clarify that we don&#x27;t blanket ban TV and iPad. It&#x27;s not an absolute, just a general rule.<p>With iPad especially, there&#x27;s a whole lot of potential good stuff there, too. We let him use the iPad when we are supervising, or just sitting with him if he is in one of the painting or music apps. He&#x27;s pretty awesome at Garage Band, and incredible using EasyBeats. He does a lot of painting in Paper and apps like that. And although he is not allowed to, he is a small and clever <i>homo sapiens</i> and therefore predictably manages to sneak a substantial amount of screen time, whenever somebody leaves an table or phone around with an easily-guessed password.<p>With TV, we watch NHK news around him -- he doesn&#x27;t tune in to it. We had to stop watching the news channels with commercials though; as soon as one would come on, you could see him stop building his Duplo block tower and swivel his head to focus on the TV.<p>I do let him sit down and watch UFC fights with me, though -- that is the hypocrisy that proves the earnestness of my intentions.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/pages/media-and-children.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-ini...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.medicaldaily.com/interview-dr-dimitri-christakis-explains-why-television-bad-babies-brains-241578"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medicaldaily.com/interview-dr-dimitri-christakis-...</a>",1435833266
9817990,comment,9817209,9817209,0,0,ppereira,,,"It looks like this is not a &quot;saturation&quot; site for testing the basic income theory.  All participants appear to start with the same income, but the basic income group receives their income with no strings attached.  This can create some unfortunate incentives that would not occur had everyone received a basic income.<p>For example, if you have one group with a basic income and one group without a basic income in the same population, the group without would be more likely to be hired for low wage jobs because that salary is much more important to them.  If everyone had a basic income, then all potential hires would be on an equal footing and it would not look like the non-basic income group is more employable.<p>One way to test the basic income theory is to give everyone a very low basic income and then slowly increase that amount over time.  If basic income works, it should be beneficial even at low rates that do not massively disrupt the tax and welfare system.  When this is seen to have beneficial effects (or at least not adverse effects), the rates can be increased.",1435833238

You could equally say that kids learn better by interacting with people than with cuddly toys, so we shouldn&#x27;t let kids have them either.<p>Having a child watch TV,or play with a doll or an iPad, doesn&#x27;t mean you will now stop talking to your children, and parents aren&#x27;t going to be spending every single waking second talking to their kids.<p>So the question that should be asked is whether TVs and iPads are better or worse for kids than the other things that they could be doing during the times that the parents isn&#x27;t going to be actively interacting with them - things like playing with their dolls, crawling around the house, listening to music, sitting and staring out the window etc.<p>And I&#x27;m guessing that the answer to that question is that they aren&#x27;t intrinsically particularly better or worse than any of those other things, and that the problem comes when you let any one activity be the default way of keeping the kids quiet.<p>Of course there are parents who replace any actual human interaction with 18 hours of TV a day.

A New York Times editorial about the Morison case basically presented an argument that Reagan&#x27;s DOJ <i>invented</i> the modern leak prosecution, using a novel interpretation of the Espionage Act to override the will of Congress, which had refused to criminalize leaks in general.<p>And of course, the information Morison leaked was positively anodyne compared to entire databases full of diplomatic cables, or North Korean proliferation intelligence sources, or the precise details of which Chinese computers the NSA TAO group was hacking. Which is funny, because the NYT editorial called some of that kind of information out as the sort of the Congress <i>did</i> want to outlaw leaks in.<p>But that aside: I was stepping back from leak prosecution to the broader issue of transparency.<p>The Reagan administration was less transparent than this one, or even the Bush Administration (which was itself also less transparent than this one).

Most estimates of deaths due to state crackdowns, gulags, and so forth within North Korea put the number right around 10% of the entire population of the country. A catastrophe equivalent to the holocaust has happened in North Korea but few people appreciate that it has because of the extreme secrecy of the regime. On top of that there are the continual threats North Korea makes to the security of the region and the world, their acts of terror (they&#x27;ve downed airplanes, kidnapped civilians, and worse).

But &quot;number of valid algorithmic approaches offered&quot; is, as would be &quot;validated time complexity of best offered approach&quot;.<p>The idea that a tech interview should be digging deep into a candidate&#x27;s background to assess their experience and derive intelligent questions that reveal depth is, I believe, <i>the pervasive myth underlying all bad technical hiring</i>. The people who conduct technical interviews are developers, not trained psychologists. Developers have a pronounced tendency to overestimate their own confidence in things like interviews. For lack of a more eloquent way to put this: developers suck at interviewing.<p>There&#x27;s no better way I know of to interview devs than to have devs do interviews, because it takes a trained developer brain to accurately classify answers to useful tech questions (ie, &quot;is this unexpected response incorrect, or is it a correct response that uses a more clever approach than the one we expected, or is it a correct response phrased in different terminology than we&#x27;re used to&quot;, &c). You have to have devs doing interviews.<p>So the next best thing is to stop pretending that devs are capable of doing something that they&#x27;re mostly not capable of doing. To me, that says &quot;take a couple weeks to come up with a standardized interview that every developer will give&quot;. Watch the responses to those interviews. Look at who those interviews select; if those people seem to be working out, stick with it, else adjust.<p> <i>One indicator I&#x27;m playing with: if anyone on your team</i> looks forward to <i>doing interviews, you&#x27;re doing something wrong; for the interviewer, the process should be mostly very boring.</i>",1371926391

My assumption based on very little evidence is that the Chief Executive should have access to all classified information held by the executive branch&#x27;s agencies. That seems to be logical. I seriously doubt that the President would accept an answer from one of his chiefs that &quot;that information is classified.&quot; Now, a more nuanced and interesting answer might be found by digging into not whether the President <i>has</i> access to all classified information, but whether the President <i>chooses to interrogate</i> that classified information. There, I assume a President <i>should</i>, because if s/he does not, that raises serious doubts about a President making thoroughly informed decisions.<p>The only way forward for solving this problem is for the People to collectively say, with full knowledge of the potential consequences, that they are absolutely not willing to compromise, and want their government to trade <i>security</i> for inviolable protection of their freedom.",1371926312

The object here is the container, not the elements themselves.<p>I can&#x27;t comment on other languages, but I&#x27;d say that guideline is a little too strict for Go.<p>The classic implementation of Breadth First Search involves iterating over a queue as you fill it.<p>&quot;don&#x27;t modify the RHS while in a range clause&quot; would be a more suitable guideline for Go. Note that it&#x27;s subtley different from &quot;iterating over&quot; - indeed, the answer to my bug was to iterate without using the range clause:<p><pre><code>    for i := 0; i < len(input); i++{\n        if newValue := test(input); newValue != nil {\n            input = append(input, newValue)\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI now appreciate the difference between this and the range clause - the length is evaluated every iteration this way. The range clause evaluates it once, at the beginning - rule (1).",1371924639

The only way to be free is to do your own thing.  For some that's starting their own business.  For others it's walking in, working for awhile, learning what you want, and walking out the door when you're done (not when the company is done with you).<p>Oh, and what's the deal with note #1?  That was a silly and unnecessary note to add.",1206233879

143676,comment,143634,143634,0,0,Hates_,,,"Just a few observations.<p>1.No explianation of what the secret URL is. I uploaded a photo and was unable to add tags straight away. Confused I went to My Photos but was told I needed to login ""Hmm I don't have an account..."", so I put my email addess into the forgotten section just to see what happens and got an email (In which the link wasn't clickable) from which I pasted in the URL. Then I was in ""My Photos"" and could edit and tag my existing stuff. But...<p>2.Users are able to upload photos under the guise of other users?!? Seems that even though I now have an ""account"", anyone can just use my email address and upload photos into my area. I opened up a different browser and could upload photos without it asking me to authenticate my ""account"".<p>3. Seens ""My Photos"" is just a link to the login section, until I specifically go to ""My Settings"" and set a password. No where is this clear.<p>I think it's getting there, but needs a lot more work when it comes to directing users with what to do next. A lot of people who would be using this service will have little clue as to what to do next.",1206232054

I always hated working for other companies, but felt that I ""had to"" because I was afraid of taking the leap.  (and yes, of course, it is more secure/stable/etc)<p>But yes -- I definitely did not go into this blind.

By numbers of individuals, diversity, and by mass, bacteria and blue-green algae make up most of the biological world. Multi-cellular life only appears dominant to you because that's who you eat and who you mate with. Evolution cares not a whit for smart, dumb, slow, fast, it only cares who has the most babies who live to make other babies. Making arguments for the virtues of entrepreneurs is fine, just don't try to dress them up as scientific truths, unless you actually can muster the evidence.",1206231288

BUT it seems that many usability experts suggest dragging users through one step at a time?<p>How to decide? Will there be an equal number of people that hate my choice either way?",1206230916

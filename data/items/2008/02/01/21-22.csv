PG told him he was a Woz and he needed a Jobs.<p>But to my knowledge, no, they have funded any open source projects.",1201903110

I recall everyone gloating over all the trouble they had trying to move that from FreeBSD to NT.   IIRC, Yahoo does not use a lot of MS products on their servers... maybe I'm wrong, or maybe MS will be less insistent about pissing away lots of time transitioning to their tech?",1201902882

108036,comment,107683,108031,0,0,curi,,,"I agree throwing in a lot of variables with names can make code easier to read. You can also achieve the same effect by making one-line functions that just call a few other functions.<p>It's quite possible that the prevalent <i>style</i> of writing Lisp code is in some ways worse than the dominant <i>style</i> for C/java/etc. But that is a different issue than the language itself, which can, for example, create a bunch of name intermediate variables, if you want them.",1201900837

Desktop apps written with web-app technologies have... cons. The interface is limited to what the browser can support. There are more moving parts. You have to worry about synchronizing the data. You have to worry about pushing out upgrades. You have the same support costs as any Windows desktop app, and <i>worse</i>, because you're supporting a system that nobody else has ever seen because you wrote it yourself. Etc. Etc.<p>Of all your ideas, the Asus-eee one seems the best -- just make the customers buy hardware with the software preinstalled. If they screw it up, have them mail it in for a new one. If the eee gets discontinued, find another small OEM Linux PC and port the software over. If you go the vmware route you might as well be selling and supporting an installable Windows app, which <i>you already are</i>.<p>But the idea is still crazy. Customers are not stupid. They know the difference between a full-featured Windows app and a web app that has been crippled by cutting off the Web part.  You're going to throw away all the advantages of moving to webapps in the first place, and invest mighty engineering effort, all to replace a Windows program with a program that (from the non-networked customer's perspective) does <i>the same thing</i> but with a different, feature-poor browser-based interface. That non-networked 25% of your user base is likely to respond by either (a) demanding that you continue to support the Windows version; (b) switching to a competitor's Windows- or Mac- or Linux-based product; or (c) buying some networking, and joining the other 75% of the customers. Once that process has shaken down, you'll be left holding an expensive, tricky Slingshot-esque technology that has almost no users.",1201900831

You would advocate the following pseudocode?<p><pre><code>  if beercount is 0 or 1 return ""inanity""\n  if beercount is in 2,3,4 return ""good sense""\n  return ""genius""\n</code></pre>\nI wouldn't advocate that.  I think my first version is more concise in a clear way, not in a line-noise way.",1201900752

108031,comment,107683,107899,0,0,mark-t,,,"Nah, I really wasn't making any claims. I just didn't buy the argument.<p>Personally, I find Lisp easier to write but much harder to read. The syntax certainly plays some role in that, but I don't think it's the key. The problem, I think, is that it's just too dense. When you use a lot of intermediate variables, you get to name them something relevant. But Lisp code (or at least my Lisp code) usually doesn't have all of this context floating around, so it's harder to figure out what's going on.",1201899897

7332401,comment,7332128,7332128,33,0,shalmanese,,,"I&#x27;m not a lawyer but, reading through the brief, the decision doesn&#x27;t seem so bad or consequential as it may seem.<p>The crux of the matter seems to be that Youssef, the director, did not make Garcia sign any form of written contract before filming her scenes.<p>A standard work for hire contract would have relinquished Garcia&#x27;s copyright claims to the work and none of this mess would have happened which is exactly why every professional organization insists on contracts being signed.<p>Absent a contract, the court is forced to determine what the implied contract is. Now, if Youssef had hired Garcia to work on &quot;Innocence of Muslims&quot;, the court may have determined that for a 5 second appearance, a work for hire was implied and Garcia&#x27;s copyright claim does not outweigh Youssef&#x27;s.<p>But that&#x27;s not what happened, Youssef hired Garcia to work on &quot;Desert Warrior&quot;, a film that was described as materially different from &quot;Innocence of Muslims&quot;. Given that, it becomes tricky to determine whether the implied contract was broad and general or towards a specific piece of work. The lower court interpreted it as general, the appeal disagreed. I can see both sides of the argument but, given that no contract was signed, it seems correct to me to give the maximum latitude towards Garcia.<p>The court decision though, is that only the 5 seconds that Garcia appeared on film could be copyrighted by her. Youssef is still perfectly free to produce a cut in which her 5 seconds is excised or replaced and re-upload it to Youtube and Garcia would have no more claim to attempt a takedown.<p>So, in summary, this case only creates a precedent if:<p>* No work for hire contract is signed<p>* You materially misrepresent or misappropriate the nature of work to be performed<p>* The person later files a copyright claim<p>* The work can&#x27;t easily be altered to excise the copyrighted parts.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not a lawyer so I may be reading and interpreting the case wrong but it seems largely reasonable.",1393829665

No matter what happens in the future, one or another species-obliterating risk is a certainty. Here&#x27;s why:<p>1. Our species has existed for about 200,000 years.<p>2. On that basis, and given our present knowledge of biology and evolution by natural selection, it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that, within another 200,000 years, we will have been replaced by another species who either successfully competed with us, or into whom we simply evolved over time.<p>3. Human beings are a note, perhaps a measure, in a natural symphony. We&#x27;re not the symphony, and we&#x27;re certainly not the reason the music exists.<p>4. Based on the above estimate, there will be 10,000 more human generations, after which our successors will no longer resemble modern humans, in the same way that our ancestors from 200,000 years ago did not resemble us.<p>5.

You&#x27;re wrong in this case. All the evidence is against you, and frankly I&#x27;m confused why you persist in your argument.<p>Your use of Google results of as suppose evidence is extremely damning to your own position and to your grasp of the English language. So my usage is 66% as common as yours? That&#x27;s pretty good evidence that both are very common and well-accepted. You&#x27;re also implying that only the most common way to phrase an idea should be used, which is ludicrous, especially coming from someone who claims to have writing experience. &quot;Cat&quot; has 447 million results, while &quot;feline&quot; has a mere 11.2 million, so according to your logic, &quot;feline&quot; is a misuse of the English language.<p>> And looking more carefully, one finds that many of the &quot;genuine belief&quot; citations are meant to refer to a belief in something thought to be true.<p>In something <i>thought</i> to be true? That&#x27;s what the word &quot;believe&quot; means. Have you been reading my comments closely? My entire point is that a &quot;genuine belief&quot; is a belief which is sincerely held by someone, regardless of whether the thing believed is itself real. The Google results for &quot;genuine belief&quot; support my usage. I checked literally every result in the first two pages, and every single one supports my usage.

Regarding the open source parts of Buttercoin, Benentt (Buttercoin&#x27;s CTO / co-founder) has been talking to our approach on reddit, <a href=""http://bit.ly/1lu58J0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/1lu58J0</a><p>=== Copied from <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z86t7/reddit_cofou.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z86t7/reddit_cofou...</a>. By Rev. C. Bennett Hoffman Buttercoin CTO ===<p>The project started off as a bit of announce-first development in response to the MtGox issues during the run-up in price last April. We had a lot of really enthusiastic people all trying to figure out what it was we were actually trying to do. Many people wanted to build a completely distributed exchange, others wanted to go other directions. That&#x27;s the beauty of open projects, even if it can be a bit overwhelming.\nCedric and I already had an interview with Y Combinator scheduled to pitch a different bitcoin idea. A few of us decided to focus on building something we could use to launch a real platform and pitch that instead. We started from scratch and kept it closed to focus on that, always with the intention of opening it back up once it was at least somewhat usable.<p>It&#x27;s taken way to long to get there. Why are we waiting for launch? Mostly because we&#x27;re too busy. There&#x27;s still a good amount of code specific to our deployment mixed into the stuff that&#x27;s actually usable by anyone else. I&#x27;m embarrassed to admit we even have a couple of test passwords and API keys floating around in the repos. In short, we&#x27;re humans of limited capacity. If I were to do it again, I&#x27;d go about things differently, but if we can put up a technically solid trading platform that helps make bitcoin (and other digital currencies) more widely adopted, then I&#x27;ll have no regrets. ===<p>3.

One of the voices is almost certainly Mark Karpeles&#x27; (based on hearing his voice in his recent public apology -- his Japanese is broken but reasonably proficient).  It seems to be a recording of a Jan 30 2014 meeting where bankers from Mizuho Bank are asking Karpeles various questions about Bitcoin, the nature of his business, his partnerships in different countries, connections to underground activity, etc. Definitely not something that&#x27;s meant to be publicly released.<p>EDIT: Listening to snippets from the rest of the recording, it seems that Mizuho is explaining that they want to cancel Mt Gox&#x27;s accounts with the bank. Karpeles seems to be protesting and asking why the accounts are being shut down. The guy from Mizuho explains (at 28:00 for Japanese speakers out there) that it&#x27;s a combination of a lot of factors, including recent technical issues, which make the bank uncomfortable dealing with Mt Gox. Karpeles also mentions following the orders of the Financial Services Agency (金融庁）<p>EDIT2: 15:00~16:10: Mizuho guy explains that the Mt Gox bank accounts will have to be shut down eventually. Karpeles says that he understands that position, but he thinks that the bank has been rude about trying to force the closure, and would appreciate a more cooperative approach.<p>EDIT3: 18:00~19:00: An awkward discussion of Karpeles&#x27; Japanese. The Mizuho person seems to be offended by Karpeles&#x27; rude Japanese, which frequently lacks the correct honorifics that would be expected in a business setting. A woman (I think she&#x27;s on the Gox team?) explains that Karpeles&#x27; first language is French and that he means no offense.<p>I can work on a fuller description of the call, but just wanted to get a quick verification of its authenticity out there, along with some snippets of the contents.",1393828375

They often are expected to pay for credit reporting/anti identify theft services for all affected customers, there are lots of legal requirements, customer relations has to go into overdrive, and if the company is a financial firm or must be PCI compliant then all of that may be amplified. Customers might even sue you, especially if there&#x27;s evidence of some negligence.<p>Of course, they must also conduct an investigation of the breach, which for most companies involves hiring a contractor like Mandiant or Fidelis to determine how it happened, exactly what was taken, what the purpose was, etc. Was source code or other intellectual property stolen? Did the attacker leave very subtle backdoors? Could they try and attack us again later based on admin passwords or portals they found? Incident response service companies charge hefty fees for that kind of work.<p>Then they&#x27;ll need to perform heavy security audits to ensure the hole, if there is a specific one, is patched. If it happened via spear phishing then lots of employee training will have to take place. If it was a server running some unpatched software then a vulnerability management program will have to be created (though any tech company should probably have one already). More money will end up being spent on security services and systems, security staff, and proper training.<p>All of that is still assuming the company&#x27;s reputation and trust isn&#x27;t damaged; in many cases it seriously is. Prospective customers may be reluctant to use the service and current customers may switch.<p>I imagine tptacek could give some more useful information here, as could any business owner who&#x27;s dealt with a serious security breach.<p>From working in the security industry though, I can tell you that most business owners likely consider a breach on the level of leaking CC numbers to be a nightmare.",1393826953

Some law-firm is going to figure out you&#x27;re a decent target, find someone aggrieved enough to be a lead plaintiff, and sue you. Maybe the law-suit is baseless, but you&#x27;re still going to have deal with the expense and hassle of defending yourself. This is not cheap. The credit card issuers will come after you to reimburse them for fraudulent activity (because your merchant agreement almost certainly has a clause holding you liable should you be responsible for a data breach). Oh, and now the payment networks are insisting you provide a full PCI compliance audit, at your own significant expense.<p>And whilst the Targets of this world typically have indemnity insurance that covers this kind of thing, Joe Startup does not. So yes, the news cycle is brief, and maybe the PR damage is minimal, but that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s going to hurt you.

I&#x27;m still doing some final touchups on the prerequisites chapters (Ch1 and Ch2) and I want to beef-up the Applications chapter, but the core material is done.<p>Several of my students asked to see the book---even unfinished---because they wanted to use it to study for their finals so I decided to make a pre-release. Once I finish the Applications chapter I&#x27;ll create the print version and a nicer looking eBook (sans-serif). The current version is intended for easy printing at home of sections that you have to study for.<p>@Irishsteve thanks for posting!

The easiest way to avoid them is to have a category method on UIView called something like &quot;alignOrigin&quot;, in which you grab the value of &quot;self.window.screen.scale&quot; and make sure to snap both the x and y of the origin to be a multiple of the reciprocal of that scale. For example, if the scale is 1, you snap to integer bounds. If it&#x27;s 2.0, you snap to multiples of 0.5. If you call that method every time you adjust the view&#x27;s position (especially after manipulating &quot;center&quot;), that&#x27;ll keep everything looking sharp at all times, and is future-proof against any new screen densities Apple might someday release.",1393826556

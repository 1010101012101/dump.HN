I'm taking issue with his use of the term ""FU money"".<p>I don't think it's right to say there are competing definitions, as if they're both equally right. I think there's a correct definition a) ""set for life"" and a wrong one b) ""set for now"". These are two very different concepts, so using the same term is causing confusion.<p>Someone in this thread said ""I have FU money for a year"", which makes absolutely no sense. This shows how misusing the term can cause confusion.",1279065575

The whole concept behind this area being known as ""The Triangle"" was based on the presence of 3 research universities (UNC-Chapel Hill, Duke and NC State) forming a triangular shaped area.  In addition to the big three, there are several smaller colleges in the immediate area: Meredith, Peace, St. Augustine's, NC Central, Durham Tech, Wake Tech, and Campbell jump to mind.   With the presence of IBM, SAS, Red Hat, Cisco, and others, there is a constant influx of tech savvy people from other areas of the country.  In particular, this area seems to pull a lot of people from Northern climates (Pennsylvania seems to send a lot of folks here) maybe because of the weather?<p>Anyway, just to illustrate a point about the Triangle... Cary (smaller city on the outskirts of Raleigh) is reported to have - IIRC - the highest concentration of Phd holders (per capita) of any city in the United States.  Now it's not necessarily the case that Phd == talent, but the point is that people here are smart and well educated in general.  Forgot any stereotypes about ""Southerners,"" the Triangle is it's own little nice with different demographics from the more rural areas.  (Not that there aren't plenty of smart, well educated people in the rest of NC as well, mind you).<p>If anything, the problem we have here is how to <i>keep</i> the smart kids who graduate from Duke, UNC, NCSU, etc, in the area.  Since this area doesn't - yet - have the reputation for being a startup hub, it seems that people come here, go to school, and then start thinking about moving <i>to</i> San Fran or somewhere ""sexy.""  There are a number of us here who want to change the culture here so that people think more in terms of founding (or joining) startups here.  F%@* California, you guys have Stanford and Berkeley, etc. to feed you talent!  :-)",1279065228

Graham, D. Knuth, and O. Patashnik.<p>But I have almost the exact opposite qualm about most books from what you air: I can't have enough precision.  I agree that there can be too many technical details, but there can't be too much precision.<p>If CS undergrads can't take it, they deserve to suffer.

I hope you will some day get a professor who uses them to good effect.<p>> Learning is ineffective when you compare one algorithm with a blurred idea of another.<p>Isn't this a good argument to learn many algorithms with precision?<p>> I might sound like a confused student, but what I'm trying to say is that there should be one unified, simple and consistent source of algorithms in understandable languages.<p>Go, write one, please!<p>> I have the large algorithm encyclopedia from Springer Verlag, and it polluted with all uncertainties of the modern CS studies.<p>Are you talking about ""The Algorithm Design Manual"" from Skiena?  I co-worker brought it to the office recently.  I can't bring myself to like it.  It seems there are too many references and not enough meat.  I have fonder memories of Sedgewick's ""Algorithms"".

But the competitors weren't doing it.<p>Not only did the campaign not match the feel of the market (users were not being zero-sum about their publishing choices, competitors were talking more about their product and communities than competitors), it didn't match the feel of Posterous. Having read and listened and enjoyed what little I know about the founders, it didn't match my picture of their real vibe.<p>Most of all... probably everybody on this board agrees... feature lists are over as compelling marketing.  What does the product help me do? User experience is what wins. (exhibit A, iphone... it redefined the entire feature phone market that came before)<p>And the funny thing is... Posterous's user experience is <i>awesome.</i> They didn't even have to go the feature route. It really is ""dead simple"" (their original catchphrase) to use.  When they used that phrase (not that they invented it, but they use it really well), it stuck in my brain. I repeated it to others.  Posterous totally had a marketing gimmick nailed and working: emphasize the experience and the easy angle.<p>All their feature comparison charts have felt totally disingenuous. For every X a competitor gets for something Posterous has, they usually have 4 things Posterous doesn't. I mean, making WP look like it less features than Posterous??! What an unnecessary risk of credibility.<p>Posterous people:<p>I LOVE your product. I use it alongside WP and Tumblr (Tumblr is social and has conversational hooks built in. I've never compared the two.).<p>Your campaign really bummed me out and disappointed me. I guess I just don't think it's the real you.<p>Your experience is awesome, and you keep adding new features.

They sold their house to free up cash.  I had to bail them out (for 18 months) when I was 22-23 for a non-trivial amounts of money, since no one else could've helped them out.

Parents of neighborhood kids are going through similar motions (selling the house to free up cash).<p>My plan?<p>* Save at least 35% of my net pay every year.  Already done, shooting for 40% now.  Goal is 50% (at current income level/standard of living).  Credit is a tool that I do use to my advantage at times, but it's rare.  Most everything is cash, including major purchases (i.e. car).<p>* Develop something to provide a 2nd income stream of at least $850/mo that only can go into savings.  That's real money over the long haul.<p>* Minimize purchases of durable goods.  I expect 15 years out of the car (only buy a car that makes you smile every time you get in it).  My furniture will outlive me.  I get 5-ish years out of clothing (and don't own much).  Electronics either need to last 10+ years or have high resale value.<p>* Plan to change careers in 17-20 years, especially if there's tangible demand in a new field.

I have to think that will change as time goes by (although I don't know far off 65 is for you).<p>That said, I'm pretty sure there are some CS professors that are 65; if they can hold that gig we should be able to crank out software (I hope)!",1279062251

So starting at 21 you could retire at around 42.<p>If you save 1/2  of that (17%) it's going to take around 28 years so your 21 + 28 = 49.<p>At 10% your looking at around 34 years or 21 + 34 = 55. But at 50% your talking about 10 years or 21 to 31.<p>PS: Taxes take a big bite out of this so it's almost not reasonable for most people to really save more than 1/3 of what they make. And plenty of people don't start at 21 which changes things.",1209574198

177590,comment,177393,177516,0,0,davidw,,,"I don't doubt that there is value in some of this stuff, but a problem that seems to be quite frequent is this: the more honest people out there can easily teach most of their clients most of what they need to know in a day or two, so unless you can land clients who really just don't want to get their hands dirty, it's tough to get a recurring revenue stream going.<p>Anecdote: at the last place I worked, we had a guy come in for an interview.  Bright guy, and came across as being straightforward, but he was really insistent about having an 'ongoing' type of deal, whereas the boss already had read a lot of what the guy knew, and so decided against it.

However, wouldn't there it be hard to find News Network from 600 ""News network"" with only 2000 users. What happens when you have 20000 users and 6000 News network. Finding a News Network could be a nightmare.. no?<p>I think you guys are using Rails, but the site is just so dogslow, why? Perhaps consider adding more mongrel instances, are your servers hitting its load with only 2000 users? The slowness of the site sorted of turned me off when I first tried the site.

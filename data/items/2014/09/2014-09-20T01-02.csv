But all current treaties, carbon taxes and unilateral actions have focussed on emissions from trackable sources.<p>I think the only reliable way to stop emissions is to stop extraction at the source. So far, our global policy appears to be to extract every fossil fuel we can economically extract.<p>At the other end, debates go on about whether to tax this emission or ban that emission. But there will always be leaks.<p>Tax one type of emission, and fossil fuels will flow to other sources that aren&#x27;t taxed. Markets are very good at this. Make it more expensive for a car to burn gasoline, the price of gas falls, and it becomes economical to use gas in some way that wasn&#x27;t covered in the regulation.<p>Shut down the oil field and the refinery, and you have an effective solution. An effective solution we are making no efforts to pursue.<p>You&#x27;ll know something has changed when the policy is no longer &quot;extract all that can be extracted&quot;.",1411178392

Wikipedia says, &quot;The law in most jurisdictions also allows the owner of a registered trademark to prevent unauthorized use of the mark in relation to products or services which are identical ... The test is always whether a consumer of the goods or services will be confused as to the identity of the source or origin.&quot;  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s reasonable that people aren&#x27;t going to be confused by the difference between a social media product (or whatever you&#x27;d call this) and a biometric device.

8343425,comment,8339263,8341969,1,0,wbhart,,,"I also agree with the caffeine thing. The reason I stay off it is not so much the immediate effect of caffeine on anxiety (I find none), but because caffeine increases mania. Ultimately mania (dealing with life frantically) causes the nervous system to respond poorly. And anxiety seems to be above all a disproportionate reaction of the sympathetic nervous system. There is also an effect on sleep regulation and a hard edge to withdrawal that can exacerbate anxiety. Incidentally, chocolate contains a related compound, but not caffeine itself. I&#x27;ve experimented with chocolate over what I would consider to be statistically significant periods of time, and I honestly couldn&#x27;t detect any effect in moderation. Your mileage may vary.",1411178284

However, in some countries, Coke is indeed made with citric acid <i>instead</i> of phosphoric.<p>Coke changes ingredients around to fit local regulations. In Europe, Diet Coke uses acesulfame potassium (&quot;ace-K&quot;), aspartame and sodium cyclamate. Cyclamate&#x27;s effect is to neutralize some of the bitterness of ace-K and aspartame, but it&#x27;s banned in the US and some other countries in the 1950s due to research determining it to be harmful. The ban is being upheld despite later research showing that the original science was flawed.",1411178277

You&#x27;re proposing they build an experimental < 50ms vision based tracker which would need a high FPS camera and a special coupled processor with novel algorithms and PC drivers which were tuned to rapidly ingest that processed signal. Interfacing with a 6-axis sensor over bluetooth seems way more sane for a project of their scale.<p>I disagree with your second point. The slight fuzziness of kinect and the additional 50ms-80ms of lag is absolutely enough to ruin the game and thus it&#x27;s not a good test of the other mechanics.

8343385,comment,8342998,8342998,1,0,beloch,,,"One thing that bothered me about &quot;Clang&quot; from the start is that I was never really convinced that a Kinect-like system couldn&#x27;t do it better.  Per Clang&#x27;s FAQ, their position was that the Kinect had too much latency. The first generation Kinect had a latency of 90 ms and the second generation had a latency of 60 ms. A bad, but not atypical display has a lag of 3-4 frames, so the newer Kinect roughly doubles the lag (or more) of a typical gaming system.  Not so good!  However, for how long will that remain the case?<p>Arguably, a better approach would be to work on a low-latency form of Kinect. First, this would provide richer input that includes the players body position in addition to his blade, which could make hit detection more realistic.  Second, a Kinect system with lower lag would have more general utility than just playing sword games. e.g. Unarmed combat would be an option too.  Additionally, authoring sword combat software for Kinect-like systems would allow you to release something imperfect on existing hardware.  It&#x27;s great to shoot for the stars, but picking off some low-hanging fruit first can help you get there!<p>Clang controllers used a few methods to give users feedback about hits.  Obviously, there was no way to make the controller stop in mid air as though you&#x27;d hit a concrete pillar with your sword.  However, it could use rumble packs in concert with audio cues to simulate glancing contact with an opponents sword or light cuts to his body. There&#x27;s no reason a Kinect-compatible stick couldn&#x27;t include the same sort of feedback.<p>So what&#x27;s the next realistic step for advancing the state of video game swordplay?  If Clang is open-sourced, it might not be an unrealistic task for somebody to hack up an imperfect Kinect version for people to try out.  If Clang &quot;wasn&#x27;t fun&quot; with it&#x27;s own controller, it&#x27;s unlikely a Kinect version that&#x27;s laggier and lacks haptic feedback will be fun either, but at least it will give people a chance to try it out.<p>Personally, I think VR displays are the key missing ingredient for swordplay games. Seeing your stick in front of you and a sword mirroring its position on the screen is one thing, but seeing just the video game sword as though it were in your own hands is quite another!  VR systems are going to have to work out low lag displays and body position data anyways but, once they do, it will pay well to be positioned to take advantage!",1411176837
8343384,comment,8342817,8343322,1,0,Daishiman,,,"I don&#x27;t know whether it was sarcastic or not, but to clarify: false skepticism is when FUD is cast around on the excuse that it is an attack on an institutional status quo. The reason why it is false is because real skepticism has a knack for rigorously questioning specific points in lines of evidence and proposing why established theories are cargo-culting their data.<p>As you can see here, none of that is taking place.

This corresponds to increase in run time at small scale only if all else remains equal, which usually it doesn&#x27;t.  And even then, it only tells you the increase for that same algorithm, rather than how to compare the actual run time to other algorithms with different constants.<p>My hope is that someday Big O will be reserved for theory and programmers will preach something more like the roofline model: <a href=""http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2008/EECS-2008-134.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2008/EECS-2008-13...</a>",1411175863

8343344,comment,8338915,8342281,7,0,shalmanese,,,"&quot;All experiments in psychology are not of this type, however. For example, there have been many experiments running rats through all kinds of mazes, and so on--with little clear result. But in 1937 a man named Young did a very interesting one. He had a long corridor with doors all along one side where the rats came in, and doors along the other side where the food was. He wanted to see if he could train the rats to go in at the third door down from wherever he started them off. No. The rats went immediately to the door where the food had been the time before.<p>The question was, how did the rats know, because the corridor was so beautifully built and so uniform, that this was the same door as before? Obviously there was something about the door that was different from the other doors. So he painted the doors very carefully, arranging the textures on the faces of the doors exactly the same. Still the rats could tell. Then he thought maybe the rats were smelling the food, so he used chemicals to change the smell after each run. Still the rats could tell. Then he realized the rats might be able to tell by seeing the lights and the arrangement in the laboratory like any commonsense person. So he covered the corridor, and still the rats could tell.<p>He finally found that they could tell by the way the floor sounded when they ran over it. And he could only fix that by putting his corridor in sand. So he covered one after another of all possible clues and finally was able to fool the rats so that they had to learn to go in the third door. If he relaxed any of his conditions, the rats could tell.<p>Now, from a scientific standpoint, that is an A-number-one experiment. That is the experiment that makes rat-running experiments sensible, because it uncovers that clues that the rat is really using-- not what you think it&#x27;s using. And that is the experiment that tells exactly what conditions you have to use in order to be careful and control everything in an experiment with rat-running.&quot;<p>From: <a href=""http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html</a>",1411175753

For example, when looking at sorting algorithms, we typically use the operation &quot;is <i>x</i> less than <i>y</i>?&quot;, or something similar to it. What the analysis then tells us is how many comparisons we make.<p>The author does not state what his operations are. So, with regards to the examples, he implies that the operation he&#x27;s counting is &quot;print&quot;. So his examples are correct.<p>You are right, though, that we can get in trouble if it turns out that our base operation - which we assume is constant time - is actually not constant time. When looking at algorithms that deal with very large numbers, for example, we can&#x27;t consider multiplication to be constant time.<p>So, with regards to the complexity of print, you are correct that it is linear - O(<i>n</i>) - in the <i>item being printed</i>. But I believe you are confusing the quantity &quot;size of the list&quot; and the quantity &quot;size of an item in the list&quot;. If we have a list of size <i>n</i>, and that list contains items whose largest size is <i>m</i>, then we would say the cost of that first loop is O(<i>n</i> * <i>m</i>).

It is entirely plausible that policies to encourage or discourage the use of different energy types should be as direct as possible - it neither makes that paying for someone else to save resources would work  nor has it been proven in practice.",1411175069

Services all have a price tag.<p>Health Care, like most services, is something we pay for. I agree that it would be better if it were less byzantine and it would be much more practical if healthcare were in priced independent of employment status. As it stands though, practically it is quite similar to any other benefit, except that sometimes, the cost is split between the employer and the employee. If you applied this logic to free startup food, it would be akin to allowing you to opt-in to the free food if you wanted it, with the company covering some percentage of the cost.<p>_<p>Its not a practical matter of whether or not we want to be taxed more, its how much we value the society our government enables and how much more we want to enable it.  Our government could use a great deal of work to become more efficient, but that is not to say that the projects facing it don&#x27;t also have a nearly infinite price tag (things could always be better)",1411174949

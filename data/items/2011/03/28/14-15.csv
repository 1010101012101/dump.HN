2378546,comment,2378227,2378227,4,0,danielsiders,,,"For me there's a bigger issue here than price, and it affects a larger market than just graphic design. I completely support the free market argument, and when 99designs and crowdspring first came out I viewed them as a great opportunity for young/inexperienced designers to work on small low-stakes projects that lacked capital and produce innovative work that would get them noticed. My experience with both sites and their users in the time since has dispelled that notion.<p>Sites like 99designs guarantee a certain number of users will submit entries for your project. While that's a great way to counter the possibility of low quality work, it poses a serious problem for designers (and eventually customers).<p>In most projects there is only one cash reward. That means if 30 people submit designs, only one gets paid. From a pure efficiency standpoint that means 30x the work is being done. Not only is this wildly inefficient, but it eventually leads to lower quality work overall.<p>Compare this structure to something like Amazon Mechanical Turk or SETI@home. In most 'crowdsourced' systems each user contributes value to a project by performing a small part of the overall work. There is often a small duplication of efforts to maintain quality and speed when a small number of users produce aberrant or delayed results. But overall the entire project is cut into small pieces and distributed to individuals. That's not the case here. Multiple submissions act as an insurance policy against poor quality work, but the very nature of the system treats that as the norm.<p>Requiring a dozen or more submissions suggests the management is aware of this issue. Higher quality designers will eventually tire of the much higher workload required to generate returns and migrate to other systems. The longer this system exists the more it will become the home of an unscrupulous breed of designers who simply change text from project to project.<p>Many 'designers' have a collection of 30 'logos' that are basically clip art that they use for every project. Since the return on their investment is so low it's not worth creating something new for each project. That leads to heavily recycled work and what can (and often does) become little more than a non-automated clip art text replacement tool.<p>There must be a better system in which creatives can actually divide work instead of duplicating it, and in so doing create a more valuable final product. The same problem exists on sites like Victors and Spoils for advertising",1301324056

2378452,story,,,1,0,24x7esubmission,"Portable milking machines and portable milkers",http://www.dairyequipments.com/milking-machine.htm,"Milking Machine,Cow Portable milking machines<p>A farmer considering the purchase of a milking machine,must read the details below as,The portable unit is a recent development with many advantages.<p>Milking by machine is done when many cows need to be milked. If fewer than 15 cows need to be milked, and if you have enough time to hand-milk them all, machines may not be worth the expense.<p>The milking machine is a nearly automatic machine installation for milking cows.<p>In operation, milk is drawn from the cow's teats because a vacuum is created within the cup device, forcing the milk through the teat canal. The pulsator alternates the pressure, first creating a vacuum (milk phase), and then applying air, which causes the flexible liner in the cup to collapse and massage the teat (rest phase). The alternating process of milk-and-rest is continued in a rhythmic pattern for the cows' health and good milk productivity.<p>There are two methods of milking a cow: by hand or using a milking machine. When milking a cow, wear latex gloves because your hands may become contaminated with mastitis-causing pathogens. Mastitis is an infection of the breast that can cause pain, swelling, and redness, and makes the milk from the cow unfit to drink.<p>Cattle are creatures of habit and thrive on routine. Cows should be milked at the same times every day, at least twice a day. Regular milking helps prevent mastitis, and also reduces stress on the cattle, which can affect the amount of milk they produce. The more equal the intervals between milkings, the more consistent the quality of milk.<p>We will talk about Portable Milking Machine and its use in today's modern dairy industry.<p>Advantages of Using milking machine:\nThere are several advantages to using an automatic milking system, as opposed to milking cows by hand. The first is efficiency. With an automatic milking system you can milk more cows, in less time, with less labor. Large dairies often use milking parlors, huge buildings designed specifically for milking a significant number of cows. Pasture cows, who are grazing in the fields, usually walk to the milking parlor. The second advantage is cleanliness.<p>Hoses and Cups in Portable Milking Machine\nA milking machine is basically a number of hoses that lead from the cow to a pipeline or storage container for the milk. The cow's teats are fitted into a metal shaped cup with a rubber liner. The cup is attached to a hose and a pulsator creates a pressure in the outer chamber to draw the milk from the cow. During this milking process the pulsator regulates the amount of pressure to simulate the nursing of a calf.<p>Pulsator in single milking machine,double milking machine:\nThe  principle depends on a partial vacuum which is created when air is removed from the hose and cup. This vacuum is created by the pulsator which admits air around the rubber liner, forcing it to create a suction on the teat. After the milking is completed, the pulsator shifts into a rest or massage phase, applying less pressure. This gentle massage helps to keep the cow's teats healthy.<p>Auto Removal in automatic milking machines:\nMany milk machines have automatic take-off or detacher devices. This releases the cow's teats when the milking is complete. Modern machines are often connected to a computer system that regulates the milking machine and stores data about the cow's production.<p>Why Daily Milking:\nTo sustain the lactation period of a cow, she must be consistently milked. The lactation period is around 300 days, and during this time a cow should be milked at least twice daily. There should be an extended time frame between the daily milkings. Milking machines can help to increase the milking to three times a day, which is actually less stressful for the cow and can increase the yield. With the more frequent milking, the cow stores less milk between milkings.<p>Economical Portable Milking Machines made for Easy and Hygienic Dairy Milking Equipments.<p>Milking Machines are extensively in demanded by various dairy farms across the world. Portable Milking Machine Systems are provided with single Milking Machine & double bucket Milking Machines. Small and Medium Dairy Farms can avail these machines in different patterns and specifications to cater to the varied needs of dairy Industry.These Milking Machines help in assimilation of milk more effectively.<p>Milking Machines are Ideal for Small farmers and  Medium Dairy farms and It Helps to produce better quality milk. With the help of there Portable Milking Machines it is easy for small Dairymen  for Milking 8 to 10 cow per hour.<p>It is also very pleasant to the Pet or Animal  as it simulates call sucking milking.It offers dairy man consistent Milking Practice- Uniform Milking and Ensures Hygienic and udder health.As a result it offers Increased Productivity through better Manpower management.<p>So next time you think of Milking Machines at affordable prices,Dairy Farm Equipmentmilking machine,milking machine in India,cow milking machine in India,got milking machine cow,milking machine India,portable milking machine,robotic milking machine,dairy milking machine,automatic milking machine,dairy machine,dairy equipments,think of Krishna Industries.<p>Author of the article is a leading manufacturer and exporter of Dairy farm equipments like ,Milking Machines,portable milking machines,Stainless Steel Milk Cans,Milk Buckets,Milk Pails,Stainless Steel Milk Cans, Stainless Steel Milk Collection accessories,Bulk Milk Collers.<p>You can Contact them at:<p>Krishna Industries\nhttp://krishnadairyequipment.wordpress.com/milking-machine\nhttp://www.dairyequipments.com/milking-machine.htm\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms6axpPvtf8\nkrishna.dairyequipments@gmail.com\n91 - 22 - 23803891 / 23803892",1301322377

Saying things such as ""spec work devalues the entire design industry"" suggests clearly that your definition of value is not in line with your customer's definition.<p>When this is the case, you basically have two options:<p>1.

For the past few decades, the economy has been transforming to be increasingly technological, moving away from oil and unnecessary manufacturing, transport, and administration. Several technology companies are now worth more than many oil giants. This part of the economy is experiencing an enormous growth, with large companies routinely showing annual revenue growths of 20-40%. They are now making massive investments in technology not seen since the days of Bell Labs and NASA. With such amazing growth comes a form of competitive inflation. To successful investors such as Sequoia, $40 million is simply not that much money these days. It's what you need to be able to get ahead of the competition and be successful, yet small enough for a VC to be willing to take the risk.<p>The .com bubble was the moment people first started to realize what was about to happen. Being completely inexperienced with this new phenomena, they overvalued garbage and undervalued treasures. Nonetheless, inside the bubble was a core of solid gold. In 2010, Mark Zuckerberg was chosen man of the year, only 11 years after Jeff Bezos was man of the year in the midst of the greatest ""bubble"" the world has ever seen. A few years later, he had revolutionized shopping, computing, publishing, and became one of the richest people in the world.

This is magnified dramatically in today's tech environment. I think Facebook is just a privacy breach (or stupid privacy decision) away from becoming a company that can rapidly accelerate their time on the upside of the bell curve.",1301320867

Is that correct?<p>This seems to be fairly similar in spirit to the design of BDB-JE, but without offering many of JE's features (like ACID). This similarity is a good thing - JE does a really great job in many situations. Have you done any comparisons of kivaloo with BDB and BDB-JE, especially looking at IO constrained performance?<p>Although its pretty clear why BDB-JE wouldn't be ideal for Tarsnap (starting the the Java thing), why did you chose not to go with BDB? Just a licensing issue, or more technical?<p>How do you trigger garbage collection? What kind of effect does garbage collection have on the throughput of the database?<p>What kind of performance drop do you see with very sparse trees/logs, for example with workloads that are very insert and delete heavy?<p>I haven't had time to look at the source yet, so I apologize if these questions have obvious answers.",1301320829

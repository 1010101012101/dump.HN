China has a lot of problems, many of them on a grander scale than any other country because of the size of its population. The robots are no where near the top of the list. The real issue here is that China has succeeded so well at manufacturing that it is no longer the center of low-cost labor that it once was. When wages rise, capital is substituted for labor; i.e. companies rely incrementally more on robots than humans. Not a lot new there.",1435197343

9775493,comment,9775159,9775159,0,0,doctorpangloss,,,"My mind is blown that so many people report poor experiences. Perhaps this is the wrong audience.<p>I exclusively recommend Dropbox for file sharing. It solves problems for families and small businesses, especially at its free tier.<p>Even on a strictly philosophical level it excels. It&#x27;s not that it solves problems (all the competitors do), but HOW: with folders. Everyone knows folders. People working together really ought to keep it simple and share a folder. It really idiot proofs what is otherwise a nightmarishly IT-esque process you get from Google Drive and Box.<p>Like where do your Google Drive files live? Do they live in Drive? Do they live in Docs and Sheets? Why is it called Sheets now? Am I emailing a copy of the document, a link to the document, did I share it with this person? What does &quot;anyone with a link&quot; mean? Why are there forty ways to do the same thing?<p>I think so many of us are missing the point on usability. I&#x27;ve only seen one poor experience with Dropbox: When a mom tried to install it by Googling, and somehow ended up in some kind of keywordspam site and installed some other garbage.<p>Then there are the features that are great not because competitors lack them but because they&#x27;re easy to explain. &quot;View previous versions&quot; and &quot;Show deleted files&quot; have saved the people I &quot;IT&quot; for. More importantly, it&#x27;s trivial for me to explain, &quot;Right click on the file and click, Show Previous Versions.&quot; But explaining to people how to interact with the hilariously multi-modal UI that&#x27;s constantly changing on Google Drive? Sure it works, but it&#x27;s so difficult to explain.<p>I&#x27;m not disagreeing that on a whole, Google Drive is a more useful thing. But I&#x27;m not talking at some crazy high level of abstraction. People who don&#x27;t &quot;thing&quot; but write essays, make movies, plan trips, send links, share tax info, share music, do research... It&#x27;s a one-author-at-a-time each-person-is-a-stage-in-the-pipeline workflow. Dropbox really augmented what people already know how to do without opinions like Material Design, use Android phones, popups that suggest to use this non-built-in browser and non-built-in maps tool. Dropbox steps around all of Microsoft, Google and Apple&#x27;s synergistic and collaboration-hostile bullshit.<p>Google Drive makes a ton of sense for an organization like Google or Microsoft, where the prevailing reality of work is: A bunch of people work together to make a report for their manager&#x27;s consumption and need to toggle on-and-off permissions across a variety of stakeholders. But jeez guys, can&#x27;t we see that the giant-corporation nightmare isn&#x27;t the reality of how things are done for the vast majority of normal and productive people?<p>It would be shame if Dropbox allowed the enterprise mentality to creep in. IT is a horrible thing and I wouldn&#x27;t want to inflict it upon anyone.",1435195707

I still have a suggestion to think on that I&#x27;ve only seen a bit of: macro-assembler for verification. Have a concept for it. Like Hyde&#x27;s High Level Assembler, you create constructs (eg control flow or array operators) useful for implementing programs or say a compiler. You verify their implementation in such a way where people can just call a function and your code converts it directly into equivalent machine code. These can be composed into other routines where provers or analysis tools can more easily argue about the resulting properties. There&#x27;s also a reuse aspect.<p>On other end, one uses an ML-like language, SPARK Ada, or something designed for easy verification to specify and test the behavior of the software. Like FLINT or Cleanroom, one breaks it down into functions amendable to analysis or verification. Those functions&#x27; implementations are done in a way that can straight-forward albeit tediously written in the verified, macro-asm. Human review and test-centered equivalence checking argues correspondence at first with formal methods later if desired. Run verified asm toolchain on it to get a correctness argument that your app&#x27;s source equals machine code. If your app is a compiler, you will have many more without hand-doing the macro-asm and a bunch of verified macro&#x27;s to use in next app. ;)<p>What do you think about macro-asm + formal methods for verified component construction ground up + top down? Any potential you see?<p>Note: My scheme was inspired by both VLISP and Wirth&#x27;s Lilith machine. VLISP implemented PreScheme first then used it to implement the full software. Wirth implemented a more ideal processor ISA, M-code, that represented things like stack operations with perfect Modula-2 compatibility. He then did a Modula-2 to M-Code compiler with the rest of the software written in Modula-2 w/ M-code for acceleration. For both systems, raising the machine level up a notch reduced their overall work and made the source more consistent throughout.",1435194088

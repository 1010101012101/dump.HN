6724630,comment,6718654,6718654,16,0,csmuk,,,"I see a lot of reactionism on this thread regarding &quot;kids and chemistry sets&quot;. I agree but disagree. With the right supervision, it&#x27;s awesome. The latter is key.<p>I had multiple chemistry sets and am not dead and have all my fingers. In fact I was always, with the aid of reference books, mixing various things together purchased from every day shops, purchasing piles of fireworks and doing things frowned upon.<p>At my secondary school in the early 1990&#x27;s we were allowed to help ourselves to stuff in the chemical larder as long as we told them what it was for and did the lab safety test first. It was stuffed full of small chunks of Uranium, sodium (under oil) and all sorts of nasty shit that could easily kill you without much notice.<p>Inevitably we passed that as too dangerous and proceeded to stock up on fumic nitric acid, formaldehyde and ammonia. This was done with supervision.<p>About two hours later, in a fume cupboard, we had 50g of RDX (C4 precursor) which was considerably more dangerous than the above. We carried this in a metal flask on a public bus to local GSK labs where they did NMR spectroscopy on it. People were interested and quite helpful there. Then we took it to the school field and blew 10g of it up with a magnesium taper. The rest was disposed of by the lab techns (probably by doing the same because they were slightly nuts).<p>We extracted Aspirin from willow, made RDX, various plastics, thermite, did glasswork, extracted our own DNA, made fireworks and countless other things I can&#x27;t remember now that were cool.<p>Now we would be branded terrorists.<p>Chemistry was awesome and no one was hurt. My understanding for the universe from a physics and chemistry perspective is pretty good due to this.<p>I would buy this chemistry set in a second.",1384343831

6724589,comment,6723521,6723862,36,0,Theodores,,,"If you blow the whistle on something then all of your resources are put into getting to the whistleblowing stage. The dedication is entirely devoted to the act, not the aftermath. All that is expected of the aftermath is a bumpy ride, the possibility of being universally despised, ostracised from society and so on. Money and the means to get by is not perceived to be such a big problem when one is fully prepared to end up in Guantanamo Bay. To some extent that is the end goal, in that respect Chelsea Manning succeeded. Snowden did pretty well getting to Russia, getting some hangers on to provide support and getting a job. The fact that he is broke is mere mortal stuff, he is waiting for his pay check to come through.<p>As any ex-cat-1 prisoner can tell you, life on the run is the most expensive way to live. With Snowden he has had many agencies after him, all with their different approaches. Obviously the U.S. have been on his case, they tend to be good at the sigint stuff but not so good at actual spy trade craft. I would not be at all surprised if there was a British team on his case too, better able to watch him pop to the shops for a pint of milk. Then the Russians will be monitoring everything, on their home turf and able to keep watch on who is keeping watch. Not all watchers will be hostile to him, after all we are all human (Tony Blair excepted), however, none of the many folks observing him will be able to assist him. They will watch him starve rather than intervene.<p>Presumably he is not as on-the-run as he has had to be, however, the practical implications of being completely on-the-run are more than you might think. Imagine he wants to be able to do things like sleep without being observed. That means he has to move every day, and at extremely short notice so anyone watching him does not get a head start, e.g. to bug a hotel room before he gets in there. He also has to pay cash up front just on the off chance he has lost his tail. Then the same again the next day and the day after that.<p>Eventually he will realise that trying to escape his watchers is a fruitless task and decide it is better to take a disinformation approach. At this stage he could try to convince those behind the bugs that he has gone mad. Claiming to be the messiah, pretending to have narrowly avoided being poisoned, hearing voices - standard lunatic stuff. He might also want to go the extra mile on proving that he is no longer an existential threat to the American Way of Life, taking up a pastime such as computer gaming, putting in marathon Playstation sessions and completely ignoring the news. After a year or so of doing this he will be able to convince himself that he has his privacy back and live the normal life.<p>Snowden probably also has had the problem of living off a good pay cheque and then having to adapt to a normal pay check, or no money at all. If you are used to paying thousands a month on accommodation, buying nice food and doing things like driving a car then it can take a while to adapt to barely having enough money to afford groceries for the next day. A mental attitude has to change, from being generous with tips to actually living off what that tip would be. That change does not happen so easily, even if circumstance forces that change to be necessary.<p>Anyway...<p>This talk of sending the guy a few bitcoins is far off from the reality of his situation. Sounds to me that he actually does have everything that he needs to live, i.e. a job and a few close friends. He has sorted himself out. He does not need to be beholden to charity handouts.",1384343162

If that is not the case then it seems to me that the basic theory must be incomplete, because to understand the real signal you <i>need</i> to understand the hidden costs.<p>Note B: If the impacts are generally small, then again we could probably largely ignore hidden costs, but if they are large (which they definitely are in some cases, for example the Deepwater Horizon spill) then surely understanding the hidden costs becomes crucial, which in turn lessens the value of the basic theory.",1384343088

As long as there is any way for a country to decide to deploy drones they will find a way to comply with the letter of whatever restrictions you put in place.<p>The drones are perhaps a good opportunity to look at the broader picture. Maybe we need to recognize that one country sending weapons and troops into another country on their own initiative is a fundamental violation of human rights and basic morality. The only way troops or weapons should be deployed is to stop greater harm from happening, and the only entity that can judge the greater harm is one that looks beyond national borders.<p>For me the simplest way to &quot;clean up&quot; war is to make all war illegal, and only allow troop and weapon deployments outside of a country&#x27;s own national borders under the UN banner for peacekeeping purposes.

Those are _only_ in my head (well, one GPG passphrase is also in a sealed envelope in work&#x27;s safe). Everything else is in 1Password locked behind a 7 word (intentionally misspelled) pass phrase  there are right now 866 sets of credentials in there - mostly 16 or 25 character (depending on when they were created/updated) random upper/lower/digits/special strings - with a few exceptions where sites/services won&#x27;t let me use 25char passwords or sometimes prohibit &quot;special characters&quot; (Like your slow cryptographically secure hash function is susceptible to SQLi or XSS? That&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t use quotes or angle brackets? Really? Or are you actually incompetent?)<p>The 1Password file is synced between 4 machines in two physical locations plus 3 mobile devices, and time machine archived on one machine in both physical places - and one of those time machine archives is EncFS encrypted and stored on Dropbox and archived on S3 weekly, the other is daily rsynced to a pair of local drives. The passphrase isn&#x27;t written down anywhere - but a hint which&#x27;d remind _me_ of the passphrase but would be innocuous/meaningless without sufficient context is written down and safely stored in two places. I _would_ be screwed without my 1Password data.<p>In my more paranoid moments, I wonder if both EncFS and 1Password&#x27;s encryption is reliable enough to make leaking that file to Dropbox (which means S3/Amazon, which means the NSA if they&#x27;re ever curious enough to ask Dropbox and/or Amazon for it). I also wonder about the attack vectors I&#x27;ve opened by having the 1Password file and app on two iOS devices - potentially leaking them to Apple and hence the NSA.

It still mainly use Postgres these days, but I regularly swear at it over things I know would be far simple than MySQL for those reasons (replication used to be a huge one, though that is now finally getting there, 8 years after I set up my first &quot;large&quot; replicated MySQL setup)",1384340829

Some examples for apps written in PHP:<p>- bcrypt (at least 10 work factor) or PBKDF2 (at least 10K iterations of sha256) for password hashing.<p>- PDO and prepared statements for all DB queries. Don&#x27;t let me find a single `mysql_query()` function call in your codebase, the mysql extension is deprecated anyway.<p>- Proper XSS filtering with HTMLPurifier or equivalent. BBCode and Markdown are not XSS filters, don&#x27;t trust their regexps to keep you safe.<p>- Systematic protections against CSRF attacks. Don&#x27;t do it manually. Don&#x27;t trust plugin authors to get it right. Use a helper to insert a token to every form and every AJAX call. Validate the token automatically when submitted. No exceptions.<p>- Protections against arbitrary code execution via uploaded files (Never execute or `include` them!)<p>- Out-of-the-box compatibility with SSL (especially when generating absolute URLs), HTTP Strict Transport Security, set cookies with &quot;secure&quot; and &quot;httponly&quot; flags by default, etc.<p>- UTF-8 everything (primarily for convenience, but also helps protect against XSS and SQL injection using weird charsets)",1384340619

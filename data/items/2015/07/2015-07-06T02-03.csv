But that doesn&#x27;t mean the revolution didn&#x27;t happen, or that it wasn&#x27;t motivated by inequality.<p>> Likewise, I admire your optimism that Chinese inequality will be solved just as soon as the newly rich realize that they&#x27;re Communists. I hope the future will prove you right.<p>That&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m saying. I&#x27;m saying that China has already had one revolution where inequality was a driving force.

9836452,comment,9832474,9836063,0,0,studentrob,,,"Hmm, I read that there was no notice given.  Either way, I agree with you that personally identifiable information should be forbidden and censored by mods, admins, and the community as general policy.  I may have misunderstood your meaning.  I read that you support blocking offensive speech.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that removing/blocking the old content (as much as I did not think it was funny) is a good idea.  It stokes a fire.  Giving notice to the moderators, and then either replacing them, or closing submissions to that sub, and cleansing old data of personally identifiable information seems more appropriate.  Under the current circumstances, it&#x27;s really difficult for the community to verify that what was claimed happened actually happened: we&#x27;re blocked from seeing it all.  There could be more transparency, and I think that&#x27;s what folks are clambering for.  The firing of Victoria, santa, and the leukemia boy with no notice point to the same issue, and these were just the final straws that broke the camel&#x27;s back for many people.  Reddit still has an opportunity to be both an awesome community and a monetizable business.  It just depends what steps are taken from here and if they&#x27;re consistent with old policy, or if managers will really get introspective and work with the community to make some changes, even if they aren&#x27;t the exact ones demanded in this petition.  The way I read this saga is, each time something happens that demonstrates a lack of transparency or oversight in how the community operates, more people get upset: it is more evidence that the lack of communication was not a one-off mistake.  Rather, it&#x27;s habit and deeply ingrained.",1436151256

<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3bnjhe/hi_i_am_alan_stern_head_of_nasas_new_horizons/csntvhk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3bnjhe/hi_i_am_alan_s...</a><p>>We’re limited in other ways, weirdly. For example, LORRI, our high resolution imager, has an 8-inch (20cm) aperture. The diffraction limit (how much an 8” telescope can magnify) is 3.05 mircorad. which is just over half the size of single pixel 4.95 microrad. So if we swapped out the current sensor with a higher res one, we couldn’t do much better because of the laws of physics. A bigger telescope would solve that problem, but then it would make the spacecraft heavier, which require more fuel to send to Pluto AND a longer time to get there, because the spacecraft is more massive. We launched Pluto on the largest, most powerful rocket available at the time (the Atlas V, with extra boosters), so again we’re limited by physics: “At the time” doesn’t mean best ever. The Saturn V rocket, which sent astronauts to the moon, was actually more powerful.<p>>More megapixels also means more memory. For example, LORRI images are made up of a header and then the 1024x1024 array of numbers that make up our image and go from 0 to 65535 (216). There’s not really a way to make that info smaller if we went to 2048x2048. We could downlink a compressed version, but we want the full info eventually.<p>tl;dr<p>1. Between optical physics and balancing different costs to launch mass, it was the sound engineering choice.<p>2. Higher resolution would take even longer to retrieve the captured data.",1436150906

True, once someone complains about their miles disappearing, United might pull them back and ban the receiving account, but it might take a while.<p>Put that into context - there are several groups of people:<p>A - those who are accruing miles who don&#x27;t know/care<p>B - those who accrue miles but only use them/care when they are going somewhere in which they want to redeem them (ie vacation)<p>C - those who check their accounts daily<p>I would argue the vast majority of United&#x27;s customers fall into A or B. Which means that by the time the customer figures out what happened - the miles will be long gone. And I&#x27;m sure United&#x27;s response will be &quot;sorry can&#x27;t do anything&quot;.<p>> When United takes them back, the buyers will be without recourse.<p>That is assuming they are even willing or the miles haven&#x27;t been redeemed already.<p>Playing devil&#x27;s advocate this isn&#x27;t United&#x27;s fault really - what is the balance between security and ease of use?

Because, yes, in the ES7 async/await world, you&#x27;re going to want to use promises heavily because they&#x27;ll work so great with that.<p>But in the ES6 world, making your API promise-based makes it heavier-feeling and more awkward than simple, clean callbacks. (Which get an unnecessarily bad rap from people who don&#x27;t work primarily in JS; there are cases when callbacks get awkward, but just looking at code that&#x27;s four levels of indent deep and declaring it &quot;callback hell&quot; -- as you so frequently see -- is a super-shallow analysis. That code is clean and easy to understand, as often as not.)",1436149223

Option 2 would be good for companies that are looking for a cash bump on the way out.<p>At a financial level I see a bunch of people with lists in the 10&#x27;s of thousands and they are surprised how little it is worth. To earn a western level income from a contact list you&#x27;d likely need a hundred thousand plus of contacts assuming a typical consumer audience and reasonable response rates.

This has nothing to do w/ the tech industry. I only voiced that I am getting tired of people, especially now-a-days, going on a bash party against men every time some woman goes through something. The majority of men, regardless of industry, still want to respect and protect women.
So, here we are.. A woman gets trolled on the internet and, because she feels she&#x27;s the center of the world, it&#x27;s ok for her to incorrectly cast this against males in the tech industry?

And there&#x27;s deeper issues to address here really. Were &quot;equals&quot; but the gender defending still isn&#x27;t. Men are still running to the rescue of women at the slightest peep of wrongdoing.. The reverse isn&#x27;t true.. So, I stated in extended commentary : Contrary to what is being portrayed, men still are stepping all over each other to defend women.<p>The rampant retraction of the upvotes my initial post is seeing just goes to show how men are willing to stab each other in the throat even when the truth is mentioned just to show a woman that they support them.

And to some extent they&#x27;re right - it&#x27;s not reasonable. Unfortunately being a public figure, especially by critiquing that phenomena, is going to attract more of that abuse.<p>It pains me to see people call that sort of thing an issue with the &quot;tech industry&quot;, though. Not that the tech industry is perfect, but that grouping in the internet trolls with people who care and want to fix the things that do need fixing is really counter-productive when you&#x27;re trying to win a war of hearts and minds.",1436148381

They read these in to the mainframe and came back a few hours later or even the next day to see the results. Often there was no useful output, as a result of a simple syntax error.<p>Students taking introductory Computer Science courses made a lot of simple syntax errors. Some people at Cornell University wanted to help students out. So they wrote CUPL.[1] Cornell University Programming Language.<p>CUPL attempted to discern the programmers true intention when encountering a syntax error in PL/I. The error message was of the form:<p><pre><code>   blah blah error
   STANDARD FIXUP TAKEN
   EXECUTION CONTINUING
</code></pre>
This was useful to people who actually wanted to learn PL/I, but for us early hackers it was more amusing to just feed in random data and see CUPL attempt to turn it into legal PL/I. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t usually do a very good job.<p>Moral: Some ideas in CS have been around for many many decades.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University_Programming_Language"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University_Programming...</a>",1436148363

That&#x27;s all there is to it.

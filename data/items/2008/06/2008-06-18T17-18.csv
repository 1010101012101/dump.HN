They've got that on their side. But they're not willing to pay enough to even cover costs of living to graduates, they don't pay people for the copious overtime they expect them to work, and to top it off they insult people's intelligence by doing a terrible job managing the teams and projects.<p>Okay, some places are probably better than others, but I never heard about any fantastic places to work at from people in the industry. And I suspect word would get round pretty quickly, given how there's about 3 degrees of separation in the UK game industry and everyone knows everyone.<p>EDIT: if I sound bitter, that's probably because I speak from experience. I was once a fresh-eyed graduate going straight into game development. (I studied computational physics, not gamedev though)",1213811704

220932,comment,220829,220912,0,0,KirinDave,,,"""Dated"" doesn't mean old, it means old-fashioned or somewhat anachronistic by modern standards.<p>All he's really talking about is a ""runtime environment"" when he says OS. What we consider the bare bones of a modern OS is, by standards set 30 years ago, irreparably full of excess and waste. Even if you look back 10 years features have been added which were once impractical. The feature creep all software experiences means that over time, what's considered the ""bottom"" of the software hierarchy is constantly reaching up to the top.<p>And it gets really complex when you start talking about emulation. Is an OS suddenly not an OS when it's run in software emulation? What about virtualization? If the resources it manages are fictions, does that change what it is? And then you get into insular environments that certainly could be made to run on bare metal environments if you wanted to, like Lisp and Smalltalk. Where do they sit?<p>Maybe ""Operating System"" is a misnomer, but it's not far from the truth from the perspective of a web programmer deploying applications to a target over the network.",1213810678

Every time data changes have to be delivered to the stores (around 500MB each) there are about a dozen servers transferring the info to each individual store. As you probably imagine it takes a long time to do it and it requires a lot of bandwidth. It will be faster if the stores could be updated from other stores, specially if they are close from each other. Do you know of any software that can help us do it.

Another reason not to use them is that the DB is difficult to scale. You can avoid using valuable CPU time for SPs on the DB server if those functions can be executed on the application or middle tier layer (that one scales well) as well.
But when I don't have scaling problems, or don't plan to change DB I use them as well.",1213810202

A Lamborghini is a piece of junk compared to a top of the line VW and will look like dogshit after five years. Similarly, lots of the most expensive men's clothing you can buy in upmarket boutiques will be falling apart after two washes. Don't even get me started about haute couture fashion.<p>The point is that once you've pushed the envelope on quality and good design, all you can add is higher price to make a product exclusive.

220902,comment,220829,220829,0,0,KirinDave,,,"Personally, I think this is a very dated position to take.<p>All computer language save exactly what the processor reads is completely synthetic, a fantasy that we all mutually support to make our lives easier. We've seen machines based off of a variety of underpinnings that directly model languages above them, so even that underlying representation  is somewhat fluid and subject to interpretation.<p>I agree that sometimes people forget about how much infrastructure surrounds them, but I also think that people working in lower levels of the code sometimes forget that their job is ultimately to make it so no one else every has to do what they are doing. Ideally, every layer completely fades away into the previous layer and you end up with a unified front which we call a runtime environment.<p>So maybe this complaint is like a Matryoshka Doll.

I was replying from my iPhone before, and skipped the username) solved half the problem (scroll pixel offset) for the topic thread list, and half the problem (inability to deep-link for any of a number of reasons) for thread post lists. Before even having to look at your screenshots, I could tell you are measuring the topic thread lists, showing that you can re-arrive at the same pixel position viewing a list of threads. However, if you try to do the same thing for posts (where this is even noticeable: as I described, a post might be long), it fails. (To describe this differently: you seem to have ignored the part about being scrolled halfway through a post, because the list you were looking at didn't even have posts... ;P.)<p>(added:)<p>> It is true that when you deep-link into a topic you've already read, with new replies, we take you to the top of the post you had a last read position at. But that seems unavoidable and correct to me. (You could argue we should start you at the post below the last one you read, I guess.)<p>This is related, but not the issue: if you are looking at the middle of some post, click a link in that post or click a link surrounding that post, and then hit back, you are brought back to a position at the top of that post, as it rebuilds your location based on the URL you were coming from (which, again, is sometimes even worse than that, as sometimes it seems that certain sinews of multiple posts forming a sub-conversation seem to be ignored for constructing the URL, so you are brought back to the top of the entire thing).",1360569315

Creating efficient transport links can create demand for travel (just as how if you build more roads, people drive more).<p>GDP is a better thing to look at then current demand because it gives you an idea of the economic capacity of the region to create demand for travel, on the presumption that demand for travel is intrinsically roughly proportional to economic activity. It's a counter-point to the common refrain that American cities are insufficiently dense and near to support high speed rail. If I can get a high speed train from Frankfurt (GDP: $220 billion) to Paris (GDP: $560 billion), distance 460 miles, why can't I get a high speed train from Detroit (GDP: $250 billion) to Chicago (GDP: $570 billion), distance 280 miles? Why would the demand for travel between the latter pair of cities be intrinsically lower than the demand for travel between the former pair?<p>The larger point is that while the U.S. may be too big to support HSR criss-crossing from NYC to LA or Atlanta to Seattle, it is divided into several mega-regions, each of which have economic density not that different from that of European countries.<p>Boston-NYC-PHL-DC, Vancouver-Seattle-Portland, Detroit-Chicago-Minneapolis, Birmingham-Atlanta-Raleigh, even Houston-Dallas-Oklahoma City all link population centers that are roughly the same size and same distance apart as major European cities.",1360567474

For example, if you shoot someone from fifty feet away, none of his DNA will get on you, or vice versa. If you wear gloves, none of your DNA will get on the gun (assuming that the gun is ever found).<p>What's even worse is that lots of people have been convicted of serious crimes even though DNA evidence existed that could have proved them innocent (by proving someone else committed the crime). There's even an organization called The Innocence Project[1] that's devoted to exonerating wrongly convicted people. But even the handful of people who are lucky enough to be exonerated sometimes spend decades in jail before their convictions are overturned, and some people have been proven innocent after having been executed. And the worst thing is that some courts will refuse to reopen cases even when convincing evidence of innocence has been produced; they'd rather let innocent people rot in jail than suffer the embarrassment of having made a serious error.<p>Also, the story says the defendant was ""broke"", which means that he was probably represented by an overworked public defender rather than a hot-shot lawyer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.innocenceproject.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.innocenceproject.org</a>",1360566903

It does this by forcing the entire ecosystem to be async too (including things like database drivers).\nBy using a Java JDBC database driver you're completely losing any async support. Same presumably goes for redis or Mongo drivers. You can do some of the work with threads and pooling, but it's still not the same, and makes this another useless micro benchmark.</i><p>Sounds like you're quoting from the ""Node.js Is Bad Ass Rock Star Tech"" satire video ( <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzkRVzciAZg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzkRVzciAZg</a> ).<p>Nothing inherently special about ""forcing the entire ecosystem to be async too"", especially since Node is more or less FORCED to do that, because javascript is single threaded.<p>Add the bad callback spaghetti implementation of async, and the main benefit of Node is easy deployment, and accessibility to the millions of javascript programmers.<p>As an async environment it doesn't offer anything either new or too compelling.",1336604363

3950935,comment,3950712,3950712,26,0,evoxed,,,"Around halfway through I jotted down a few thoughts. I like and appreciate people thinking about this sort of thing however, so I'm not saying any of this to offend.<p>> I don't see any reason that we couldn't be storing our files in abstract squares rather than folders in the sky.<p>...because they're called folders, and we know how to use them? If I said, ""Here, have a square,"" is your first instinct really to think oh! that must be for putting stuff in/on? Sure, you can abstract them to just a symbol but it's unnecessary. It's not like the system cares what you call it or how you choose to display it.<p>> The world's most advanced phones include an icon that looks like a phone handset that you haven't touched in 20 years, unless you've used a pay phone recently.<p>I have in fact, but that's not the point. Again, we know the shape. There aren't many things it could be besides a phone. You could show someone a glossy brick I guess, but what good would that do? The best alternative I can think of would be something like a speaker or microphone, but where's the argument that that would actually be better?<p>> At some time in the past the magnifying glass became the ""search everywhere"" icon, but for some reason binoculars are for searching within a document.<p>I'm just now realizing that he must be thinking of a specific piece of software. I gathered he was on Windows, now I see he worked at MS. Is this Office? This one I agree with, but it sounds like a quirky error made by some engineer or perhaps phony UX consultant. Same goes for the clipboard hell if I know why MS would use that icon for paste, but in no other software that I can think of is that normal.<p>> Envelopes<p>Same thing as folders. So our terminology expanded to cover abstract digital entities, but that doesn't make it a hinderance to our intuition. Folders, packages, envelopes... maybe they're too nostalgic for the bold futurist, but generally it's about as practical as you can get.<p>> Wrenches and Gears\nWho hasn't used a screwdriver? Or never seen a wrench? Even the people who don't own one <i>probably</i> know what it is. I'm indifferent to the gears/tools thing. It still makes sense, but I'm open to new ideas preferably a little more clever than a circuitboard.<p>> Microphones\nFor speech recognition, would an ear be better? I think most people would get the microphone bit simply from watching cartoons, talkshows, album covers etc... but I admit this will likely be more foreign in the future, and is already disconnected from people in developing countries without that much media exposure (although they apparently have an iPhone/Pad/Pod).<p>> Photography\nIt's kitsch. It still makes sense because the alternative to a square with a border is a square without a border. But for all of us who still use medium/large format cameras from time to time or for work, we can simply pretend. Lenses are a-OK.<p>> Televisions\nActually, for the large number of people who gave up cable for hulu and netflix but still want to catch the news yes! I do have rabbit ears! Maybe it's a little too retro for most video icons, but again it till makes sense, it just may be better suited to apps that show live broadcasts.<p>> Carbon Copies and Blueprints\nEh, so the term's (carbon copy) a bit outdated. But then again, when was the last time I ""pasted"" a document together? Yeah, Drawing I. As for blueprints... it makes sense for XCode right? And CAD. We may not use blueprints so often anymore, but it's less ambiguous than ""construction documents,"" which might as well be ""layouts"". Which might as well be squares with a shape on them. Etc...<p>Basically, this would be a far more interesting post if the author would go further into making actual suggestions. Some of it makes sense because it's intuitive, some of it makes sense because we're <i>used</i> to it. If you want to correct the latter, you've got to show something what's better.<p>Edit: ouch, that's an ugly post. Not sure if I can format it in any way.<p>Also, I'm looking forward to seeing what people suggest in the discussion here. It's an interesting topic for sure (and I'm sure there will be plenty of people to disagree with me).",1336604335

It's funny that hinting went out of fashion over the years, mainly due to a fairly sensible argument from Apple that displays would get better - which they undoubtedly have if you look at an iPad 3.

Sounds like 'pixel fitting' is the same process (albeit done manually it seems).<p>Waaaay back when I was at USC the Image Processing Institute there here some interesting image filter analysis of high frequency images. Basically when you take a horizontal line, and plot it x/y with X being the horizontal position and Y being the value of the pixel there, you can treat that as a signal and measure the frequency of it. If you look at B&W text you will see a series of very sharp transitions from background level to foreground level and back again. These are square waves which have well defined harmonics. So taking the image and increasing the rate of change between high to low or low to high 'sharpens' it, similarly if you are <i>rendering</i> an image and you have choices about the function which determines which pixel represents which part of the rendered image, you can do several renders with pixel offsets and maximize harmonics for maximum sharpness.",1336603710

Part of the system is the particular dialect of C++ in which a programmer can mix and match CPU and GPU code. It also includes the compiler that translates the GPU part to object code (the ISA is called PTX [1] which is one level removed from the actual GPU's ISA). What NVIDIA has open-sourced is the part that translates LLVM IR to PTX. The greatest benefit of this will be for people who are developing alternate programming models/DSLs for programming GPUs. They can translate their DSL to LLVM IR, which they probably are already doing, and then generate PTX using the open-source compiler.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Thread_Execution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Thread_Execution</a>",1336603529

Your only justification for turning down such business (as I understand it) is that you can't accept the risk of having the whole company shut down by law enforcement.  Not many people would take you to task for that reasoning, I suspect, and it would be easy to dismiss those who do.<p>It's easy to argue that software patents carry the same existential threat as law enforcement would.  At first blush it seems reasonable to write this into your TOS: <i>I agree that I will not assert any patent claims as a non-practicing entity.  I agree that my account with lessannoyingcrm.com will be terminated without recourse if I assert any such claims in a court of law, or threaten to do so.</i><p>The problem is, you've only narrowed your ethical dilemma -- you haven't eliminated it.  What if the patent troll in question was instead offering to <i>buy</i> your company for 100x revenue?  What if the patent troll in question was (e.g.) Google or Apple?  Would you have the fortitude to tell them to pound sand then?  Google may be a good example, in fact, because they've probably already found it necessary (or soon will) to threaten other companies like Microsoft and Oracle with patents that they don't practice, but have purchased for defensive purposes.<p>If you had turned down the patent troll's business, you would indeed have found yourself in an even murkier ethical swamp, so in that sense you did the right thing.  Out of all of the entrepreneurs I've known in a long career spent in and around small companies, I only know one founder with the personal fortitude to tell a patent troll to get bent.

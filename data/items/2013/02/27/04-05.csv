Note that, by design, they will never be transmitted to the server - so there is no need to mirror the client-side navigation implemented in JavaScript within the server implementation.  I think this factoring of the server-space navigation and client-side navigation is sometimes useful and keeps the two separated.",1361941191

Although multi-threaded concurrency is STILL not ""at all the same kind of node.js-style concurrency"", as node.js is evented, not multi-threaded.  But multi-threaded concurrency seems likely to make sense with random or round robin routing too. Although more research and data is called for (at least more than I have, which is zero).<p>But there's no reason to assume that node.js-style evented concurrency is the only thing that can possibly make sense with random routing.  And if it is, that's very inconvenient. Trying to do node.js-style evented concurrency with a Rails app... or any app that wasn't built from the ground-up (including all it's dependencies) for evented-style concurrency... or even if it WAS... it's non-trivial.<p>In contrast,  multi-threaded request dispatch requires not a lot of change to your code -- basically just avoiding shared  in-memory state between requests (basically, global/class variable access).<p>In addition to puma, thin in fact does have a multi-threaded mode, although it's poorly documented.<p>I think they are actually passing the buck suggesting ""We can't tell you which way to do multi-threaded request handling, it depends on your app!""  Well, sure, it always depends on your app, but that applies to their suggestions to use unicorn as well, but that didn't stop them. There are still often general best practices for typical web apps.<p>I think it's true that they can't tell us the right way to do multi-threaded request handling -- because it requires more research and analysis and experimentation (and possibly a patch or two) to figure out the best practices here, the community hasn't put enough into it yet. But if anyone's got the resources to put into it, it's heroku, and it would be rather good for their business to figure this out and educate the community.  Heroku became so respected because they seemed to really know what they were doing, to be at the top of the game -- if they can't manage to figure this out either, it lowers our trust in them.",1361940660

I taught myself/was taught by my brother when I was in 6th grade. In high school, I took the compSci AP (and spent about half the time taking a nap). The year after that, I took the 1 programming class my school offered, which was a project based intro to programming (with an awesome teacher who made sure I got something out of the class).<p>What struck me about the class was the way it was taught. We used Java (actually, Processing [1]). In most of the early lectures (which there weren't many of), he would say 'for now, this is just syntax, it will make sense later' instead of explaining the more advanced concepts needed to understand why we write certain things. The main flow of the course was (I am inventing the details):\nCalling a function tells the computer to do something. Here is a bunch of drawing functions, make a picture.\nThen, using that he would ask students to make minor changes, like shift the entire thing 5 pixels.\nThen he would introduce variables and assignments.\nUsing that, he would ask them to draw parallel lines.\nThen, he would introduce loops. \nThen he had them make a bouncing ball simulator (just 2 balls)\nThen he introduced objects<p>Every time a new concept was introduced, its use and benefit was clear because people had already seen the code duplication that it solves. After the initial lessons (which only took about a month), the class was pretty much entirely project based, where we were given (loose) guidelines and had to design and code a program.<p>Most of the time spent in that class was problem solving. Because math is an incredibly powerful problem solving tool, much of that time was spent doing math. But it was spent using math as a tool to solve a larger problem.<p>After (and during) that class, many of the other students (whom had never coded prior to taking the class) asked me for advice on programs they were writing that were completely unrelated to the class.<p>So, it is quiet possible to teach kids how to code without scaring them off. It generally helps if you don't show them pointers, or bit shifting, or linking, ETC until they are ready.<p>[1]<a href=""http://processing.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://processing.org/</a>",1361939288

Those are all good reasons to learn the language and framework but if I had to go back and learn to program again I wonder if I would have been successful or enjoyed starting with Rails and Ruby.<p>Providing a beginner friendly environment and introduction to programming was never one of the motivations behind Rails. If that's a role it can play well then that is all the better.

5290532,comment,5289532,5290384,0,0,Daiz,,,">Beamr isn't claiming a superior encoder.<p>Their sure make it sound like it in their marketing material. Hell, they've even gotten articles written about them that start like this[0]:<p><i>New technology from video encoding experts Beamr claims to be able to out-perform the new H.265 format by merely encoding H.264 better.  Their video optimisation apparently reduces the bitrate of video streams by up to four times, while retaining their resolution, quality, and - most importantly - their industry-standard H.264 format. It works on all frame-sizes up to and including 4K</i><p>All the writing out there pretty much implies that thanks to Beamr Video's new technology, H.264 suddenly compresses up to four times better. Which is obviously not the case. No site is talking about ""how most videos have 'too much' bitrate and how Beamr Video can select a much lower bitrate that is enough for the video to still look good"", because that would be much more along the lines of what they're actually trying to do.<p>Anyway, there's something else that came to my mind from the discussion in this thread. Check out this section from a PR piece of theirs[1]:<p><i>>Online streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon and iTunes typically encode full HD (1080p) streams at 5-6 Megabits per second (Mbps).  Utilizing Beamr Video optimization can reduce the required bitrate for full HD streaming to around 3-4 Mbps, enabling smoother playback, support for customers with lower broadband connectivity, and significant delivery cost savings to the streaming service providers.</i><p>Let's stop and think about this for a moment. As we have learned today:<p>* Beamr Video is not going to offer any kind of quality / filesize control in their service. Not even any kind of upper or lower bounds.<p>* Beamr Video is intended for re-encoding existing lossy video.<p>* Re-encoding from lossy to lossy is always going to introduce generation loss to some degree.<p>Combine these two facts, and you'll realize that for content providers like Netflix, Amazon and iTunes, this service is completely and utterly useless. When you're doing online streaming, <i>bitrate matters</i>. These services should all be encoding their video streams from very high quality sources (higher than what can be found on Blu-rays). If they ran these sources through Beamr, they'd only get a single video out of it, most likely at a bitrate far larger than what they're willing to stream (as demonstrated on Beamr's page, Blu-ray sources are enough to make for 9-30 Mbps streams on average, while, as the quoted section mentions, streaming services usually offer 1080p video around 5-6 Mbps). Thus, it rules Beamr out for this kind of straight encoding from high quality sources for online streaming use cases.<p>Now, they could encode all their streams like usuals, in different resolutions and bitrates, and then run these streams through Beamr, but does that make any damn sense? <i>No, it does not.</i> As I've proven, at the same bitrate, Beamr offers nothing over x264, so if any legitimate service wanted to offer their videos at smaller bitrates, <i>they could just encode their videos straight to those bitrates from the high quality sources.</i> Or, in case of something like Netflix that already encodes videos to several different bitrates, they could simply <i>drop</i> the higher-end streams. Not to mention that re-encoding with Beamr could potentially make the streaming experience worse due to the fact that Beamr does not seem to set any VBV options[2] for their encodes.<p>It's also the same situation with any digital video download services: If they wanted to offer lower-bitrate content, they could just encode the content directly to said lower bitrates. And since any legit digital video downloads are DRM'd up the bum (man, why must the legitimate digital video download market suck so much?), you, as an user, would not be able to make the video smaller through Beamr either.<p>So I guess the big question is: What actual use cases does this service have? Re-encoding Blu-ray sources isn't really that feasible for end users either, since what kind of user would have the patience to upload several dozens of gigabytes to Beamr with a regular consumer internet connection (unless they have Google Fiber or something)?<p>I guess ultimately this leaves us with regular users wanting to compress their videos taken with mobile phones or something, but if they for example want to put these videos up on YouTube, then there's really no reason for them to upload the full-sized original video to Beamr, wait for them to re-encode it, download it, and then upload that to YouTube, which is going to re-encode it again, when they could simply upload the original full-sized video straight to YouTube and have it be re-encoded only once.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.redsharknews.com/distribution/item/455-beamr-claims-up-to-75-reduction-in-h-264-bitrates-and-works-with-4k"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.redsharknews.com/distribution/item/455-beamr-clai...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/beamr-unveils-breakthrough-video-delivery-technology-with-unprecedented-75-percent-bitrate-reduction-190832551.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/beamr-unveils-breakt...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://mewiki.project357.com/wiki/X264_Encoding_Suggestions#VBV_Encoding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mewiki.project357.com/wiki/X264_Encoding_Suggestions#...</a>",1361938670

You could make a argument about digital information and the Web as a way to disseminate information as a Gutenberg style invention but I don't think programming is.<p>I don't think programming and learning to code is the ""everyday problem solver,"" ""more peaceful"" person. I think what you're talking about is the phenomena that intellectuals tend to be more circumspect, perhaps less violent whatever. We don't need programming for that. We have a whole history of knowledge and art in philosophy, literature, other sciences, logic, mathematics etc. I fail to see how programming is special in that sense?<p>The average person, say in the US, may be more likely to be able to read than in the past but they do not tend to be less ""ignorant"" of many societal issues, cultures, etc (because you bring up peace and harmony) even thought we have educational tools long standing to solve that problem, much better than programming.<p>Honestly, I dispute this outright. I've been programming a long time, met many programmers and computer scientists; it does not seem like the ability to produce CRUD correlates in any real sense to a person being less likely to join the Tea Party.<p>You're viewing programming as this great society benefiting solution to social ills or something that makes you a better person; large swaths of people would just view it as an engineering and say ""fine, sure, programming skills make it easier for you to get a job, great"" but not anything that substantially creates peace in the world -- that's too much I think.",1361938127

Let me tell you why.<p>If you try hard, you can teach some one 'how to code' but no matter how hard you try its not possible to teach some one 'what to code'. Or in other words, 'what problems to solve using coding' else everyone would be a Nikola Tesla.<p>Its easy for us to solve problems like 'Parse this XML and do X', for kids its impossible to even understand this, or why this should be done. The other stuff like sorting, factorials etc math stuff is the least they are interested in. What else, 'make this cat go around the well 5 times' kind of problem that MIT scratch deals with is a little interesting to small kids, beyond this age- teenagers or kids around who are trying to prove to the world they are not kids find it intellectually insulting to even look at it.<p>But there are problems kids like to solve. Consider things like Lego, or Origami. Or building an amateur radio by assembling stuff. Or learning to repair a device X. Kids see adventure in such things and a very visible physical product they are working with or towards. There they see a problem, and method follows thereby. In coding you focus on the method and not the problem itself.<p>As programmers we think our profession is the greatest(Just like every one else).

What I don't like is paralysis that comes with that.<p>Now, some amount of pragmatism is important, and I'm sure you've made your decision in a way that's best for you. I just hope that the entire community doesn't fall into the trap of ""there's this [regulatory/bureaucratic] risk, so forget it. I won't even try.""<p>My take on these types of hurdles is that they are surmountable with a good helping of resourcefulness. Example?<p>In our case, there's actually not FDA approval for primary  clinical use of a technique we depend on, so there would be quite a bit of legwork between us and getting to market, not to mention the hospital bureaucracy.<p>What we figured out, however, is that technicians in the pharmaceutical industry (and biotech) use this <i>same</i> technique, in similarly high volume. The barriers to them adopting new technologies are much lower, and better still, they actively demand and pay for new technologies that boost efficiency. So we're starting with them as a target market, and we'll chip away at the barriers to direct clinical adoption in parallel to revenue generation.<p>This is only one trick of many we're bringing to bear in fielding our technology, and some patience is required before we can realize the impact we dream of.<p>Handling the risk associated with being involved in medical or scientific decision-making presents its own set of challenges, as well. Briefly, our take on this is to work hard and validate the scientific merit of what we ship before we ship it. This does take a bunch of time, but having doctors and papers to vouch for what we do means that we've built trust and support in the community. Sometimes this means we ship a smaller set of features than ""what is possible"", but we're patient and see these products as stepping stones.<p>Finally, I'll note that we're a small team that's not venture -backed (at present, intentionally so). We're fortunate to have enough grant money to prevent starvation, but that's it. Really, lots of things are possible, even in the healthcare space.",1361937685

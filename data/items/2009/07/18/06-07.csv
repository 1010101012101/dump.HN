711453,comment,711310,711443,0,0,tdonia,,,"that doesn't change the original replies basic point: without consumers, neither the copyright holder nor the publisher nor amazon makes any money.  and pretty much everyone on the planet that's not a publisher/copyright owner/bookseller really doesn't care in the slightest about the perspectives of their business.  sorry, but we never will.  when you're selling something as abstract as a story you should consider yourself lucky that ANYONE is willing to  devote any portion of their non-survival budget to such trivialities.  While it's become common lately for people to be able to do so, this is a very new (less than 2 centuries) old phenomenon that's still quite fragile.  And as the music industry has so effectively proven - if you push consumers hard enough they're not going to give up on their content, rather, they'll route around the choke point and take over distribution (and by extension content production) through less centralized means.  this, in my mind, is a much greater risk facing the publishing/copyright holder industries than simple ebook platforms.",1247898341

1312548,comment,1311588,1311930,0,0,pw0ncakes,,,"American society has a high rate of mental illness because, due to some horrible choices in how to build our society and economy, our society is literally breaking down, and because our lifestyles are very unhealthy. In that regard, I'm not talking about high fructose corn syrup or preservatives-- which are mild as far as unhealthy things go-- so much as long commutes, withered social networks, a geography of alienation, and a work culture that expects even average Americans to make sacrifices for work that only make sense for the most ambitious 2-5 percent. The meager social safety net and lack of universal healthcare also creates an environment where crippling mental illness are more common, due to the feedback loops that turn a mild ""rough patch"" into a full-scale nervous breakdown (once the job is lost, health insurance lapses, medical bills pile up, et cetera). Our problem with mental illness in this country is because we're an unhealthy society, and we're <i>so</i> unhealthy as a society that throwing drugs and money at the problem won't substantially help, but that doesn't mean that the drugs are <i>causing</i> the problem.<p>There <i>is</i> a difference between clinical depression (pathology) and misery, which is often a result of bad circumstances, and even in a bad situation there's no benefit or justification being depressed <i>per se</i>, but that distinction is mainly clinical. A lot of people are miserable for circumstantial reasons, and no amount of medication can fix that (without damaging the person's mind). If you give an appropriate dose of an antidepressant to a person who is in the sort of horrible circumstances that are common for the US poor, you might stop the panic attacks and crippling depressions, but you still have a person who's likely to be miserable.<p>We do, of course, overdiagnose mental illness in the US. I know an eccentric but essentially normal person who was committed as a prank (Manhattan rich kids are the sort of sick fucks who would find this funny) and ended up in a mental hospital for 3 weeks (which is illegal, because you can only be held for 72 hours, and that only if you're in a state that represents direct danger to yourself or others). He was placed on all sorts of inappropriate medications, lost his job, and had more mental problems after the ordeal than before it. This sort of thing has more to do with our culture than with the drugs themselves.",1272812249

A ceramic mug company, for example, could have a blog that also told readers how to paint ceramic mugs.<p>The Demand Media model is to outrank that content (of course), and then to monetize the ranking with contextual ads. So the article's content must be meaningful to search engines--but it <i>can't</i> be a complete answer to whatever the visitor was searching for. If it is, they'll bounce; if not, they'll keep clicking, ideally on an ad.<p>Someone who controls the ad (and captures the profit from transactions) can have a more relevant and useful call to action. The article, for example, can end with ""Ready to paint <i>your</i> ceramic mug? Order a mug painting kit now, and get 10% off!""<p>Instead, the mug company will notice that their traffic is dropping since they can't rank for the same long-tail content.

I also just found your other great posts (<a href=""http://www.twitter.com/grellas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twitter.com/grellas</a>).<p>I should have been more clear in my post about my current strategy. I'm really looking for deals that, if successful with the angel money, may not need VC with decent probability, and if they do take VC, it wouldn't be for that much. In other words, I'm less concerned with the risk of follow-on terms at the moment.<p>That being said, I wonder if they can be justified if the angel round is small. Say I it's a $250K round and so the preference takes up $500K. You go to raise $3M VC and the VC says we want 2x because they got it. Can't the entrepreneur say, look that was for the angels because the round was so small and it doesn't make sense for us in a round this large? Of course it is all negotiable but the knee-jerk ""we need to get everything they got and more"" seems out of place here.<p>Also, I'd personally be fine with participation with a cap. It just seems entrepreneurs are more willing to go with 2x, non-participating. But my experience is very limited so if that's the norm it's fine with me. What terms do you usually see, 1.5x with participation at a 3x cap?",1272811487

What would you charge someone for postage? It would have to be less than UPS etc., otherwise there's no point not using them.<p>2. What would a driver earn for carrying a package? Some amount of money not greater than the postage charge (otherwise you'll go broke).<p>3. For what amount of money would a driver think it is worthwhile to pick up this package, or several packages, and deliver them to where they need to go? Surely more than just a few dollars.<p>4. What are the extra costs of your business, such as insurance?<p>I don't know the answer to any of these questions, particularly postage (I don't live in the US, so I don't know what the cost of sending a parcel is there). But you might want to think about it.",1272809415

Looking at the idea blind, I can't see how it can be any of these things. No pretty UI stuff will be needed until it's a viable business, and addressing these three concerns strikes me as paramount.",1272809106

Businesses and older people may be more worried about the security of their package.  You might try making a YouTube or Vimeo video about your service.  Make it sound cool and efficient.

They're also blinded by the smörgåsbord of goodies flowing out Mountain View.  And maybe to most that's a fair trade.

If VCs take a 2x liquidation preference, say, for a $10 million investment, then any exit of $20 million or less is a wipeout for founders and early-stage employees. Couple that with the pressure to shoot for a 10x return on whatever that VC investment is and you can get a shoot-for-the-moon mindset that heightens risk on the one side and a let's-cut-our-investment-risk-and-get-rid-of-this-non-performing-startup mindset on the other that heightens risk on the other (assuming the VCs have control, which they normally do).<p>Thus, 2x (or higher) is usually seen as <i>highly</i> unattractive by founders even if its immediate implications at the angel stage are not necessarily bad. In my experience, in all normal investment environments, founders will resist it and fight for 1x only (usually going for participation with a cap).<p>Your experience may vary but this has been mine over many years in Silicon Valley.<p>I can understand the logic of 2x as explained in this fine piece from the angel perspective. On its own terms, it makes sense and is reasonable for that stage. As long as it doesn't spill over into subsequent rounds, it creates no problems in itself.",1272808935

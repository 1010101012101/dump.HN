Even if we&#x27;re causing it.<p>The second link you posted seems to be a 70-minute video featuring a bunch of activists, with no text summary to explain why it should be interesting or relevant - no WONDER you didn&#x27;t get lots of upvotes! (I haven&#x27;t watched it, but would be happy to skim a transcript, a summary, or an article on the same subject).<p>The third link you posted does mention tipping points, but not based on any recent news or anything the IPCC just said. It&#x27;s an essay written by some dude who is quite alarmed about things, referring as a source back to a essay written by some other dude last year which in turn refers back to papers in 2007 and 2012. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any NEW information about &quot;tipping points&quot; therein. Yes, people were talking about speculative &quot;tipping points&quot; back in 2007. Most of that sort of talk has been dialed <i>way</i> back since then, in large part because nature didn&#x27;t cooperate. Surface warming trends are flat, and weather isn&#x27;t notably more &quot;extreme&quot; that it has been in the past.<p>Actually, it&#x27;s worse than that. When you look at the specifics of HOW the IPCC thinks we&#x27;re <i>currently</i> being impacted by climate, a huge negative current impact they note is the damage done by a rise in food prices, a rise which was in large part <i>caused</i> by crop diversion for use in biofuels. Which is to say, a misguided program from the past that was allegedly intended to help the environment, hurt us all on a global scale. If in 2007 the US had simply taken a chill pill and <i>ignored</i> the IPCC&#x27;s warnings rather than instituting more of a biofuels mandate, we&#x27;d all be better off today; the measurable current harm from climate change would be a fraction of what it is <i>and</i> we&#x27;d have released less net CO2.<p><a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/10716756/Biofuels-do-more-harm-than-good-UN-warns.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/10716756/Biofuels-do...</a><p><a href=""http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/the-biofuel-hope-that-beats-gasoline-for-climate-harm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/the-biofuel-hope-that-beats...</a>",1400752093

In a small community, you&#x27;re likely to meet the person you helped again, and thus leaving them stranded will definitely bite you. Not so in the current huge cities.<p>You say &#x27;if I helped someone the only thing I&#x27;d expect in return would be that if the person I helped is ever in a situation where they can provide help to someone else, they&#x27;ll remember the time they were helped by a stranger and take action&#x27;, but is this sufficient motivation for you to actually go out and help people?",1400752063

In a crowd an individual is less likely to take action. I think this has a lot to do with our social instincts. Being in a crowd of strangers is a new thing. We aren&#x27;t built for it.<p>On our own, we make decisions for ourselves. That&#x27;s easy. A group is supposed to be a family or troop or somesuch. These will usually have a leader. Someone responsible for deciding that this is a mugging, that we&#x27;re on the victim&#x27;s side and that we are going to join the fight. I&#x27;m not sure it has to be a literal leader, but there needs to be a pre-established decision making process and the individual needs to know where they stand in it.<p>A second issue is that this is not really a question of &quot;willingness to help&quot; in the intellectual sense. It&#x27;s a question of instinct.<p>A third is that in a city (or in modern life in general) we are surrounded by other people&#x27;s problems. The homeless person we step over, the domestic violence sounds we don&#x27;t call the cops on, the volunteer help line where we don&#x27;t volunteer at and the charity we don&#x27;t contribute to.<p>This is complicated.

The woman you helped was still probably quite shocked and dealing with police to thank you and it&#x27;s highly likely that in such a situation information like where you worked completely went over her head.<p>I think this is one of the reasons people have stopped helping others - they expect something in return. If I helped someone the only thing I&#x27;d expect in return would be that if the person I helped is ever in a situation where they can provide help to someone else, they&#x27;ll remember the time they were helped by a stranger and take action.<p>Side point<p>>> &quot;There&#x27;s not much to be gained from interacting with strangers, even less when there&#x27;s a risk of being dragged into someone else&#x27;s potentially violent confrontation.&quot;<p>The second part of this statement interests me. Is fear of something (that is highly unlikely to occur) a reason people don&#x27;t get involved?

Now this seems to have been pushed back to an ever receding horizon and people work long long hours competing to get the next grant or next placement, to keep their heads above water right up till retirement.

But then I saw the skid-marks leading across the verge from the road, and I realised this was a bit more serious. I stopped and tapped on the window. She was very distraught, nearly hysterical. It was a single-vehicle accident caused by sliding out of control on the very water-logged roundabout. The thing she kept saying over and over was &quot;nobody stopped to help! They all just keep on driving past!&quot;<p>So I phoned the police and stayed with her for the next 20 minutes, until the police showed up. I was getting soaked in the rain and making myself late, but felt I owed it to her to stay put and make sure she came through it all OK. As I remounted my bike and rode away, it occurred to me that she didn&#x27;t at any point thank me, and since then has made no attempt to contact me even though we discussed where I work (just across the road from her) as part of the small-talk. So in her own way, she was doing the same thing as the other drivers who had so upset her, albeit inadvertently. I probably wouldn&#x27;t have stopped either, except she was literally blocking my path.<p>So it&#x27;s easy to marvel at how disassociated we all are. A different thing entirely to do anything meaningful about it, even on a purely personal level. There&#x27;s not much to be gained from interacting with strangers, even less when there&#x27;s a risk of being dragged into someone else&#x27;s potentially violent confrontation. This is not a problem with phones, it&#x27;s a problem with excessively large communities where we will probably never run into each other again. So why take the risk?",1400750111

7782849,comment,7781265,7782792,1,0,BruceM,,,"This is a subject that keeps coming up over the years in the Dylan community (and why, in part, Mikel is slowly working on an s-expression reader for the current compiler).<p>It is impossible to know what might have happened if Dylan had kept the s-expression syntax and how that syntax might have evolved. When the switch was made, the language didn&#x27;t have all of the features that it soon had in the infix syntax. The macro system is just a single example of this. (And Dylan was one of, if not, the first infix language to have a macro system like it does. See <a href=""http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrb/Projects/dexprs.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrb/Projects/dexprs.pdf</a> for a discussion of it and some extensions.)<p>In the s-expression syntax, you defined a new method by:<p><pre><code>    (define-method odd? ...)\n</code></pre>\nIn the infix syntax, you do:<p><pre><code>    define method odd? ...\n      ...\n    end;\n</code></pre>\nHowever, you can supply adjectives as well, which weren&#x27;t present in the s-expression syntax:<p><pre><code>    define sealed inline method odd? ...\n      ...\n    end;\n</code></pre>\nPersonally, I don&#x27;t really care if I&#x27;m using the infix syntax or an updated form of the s-expression syntax. But to deal with the features present in the infix syntax, it would have to be a somewhat modified version of the old s-expression syntax.<p>Given the history of the last 20+ years since Dylan was created, there are a lot of other things that could&#x27;ve been done differently in the syntax as well:<p>* Something more terse and compact.<p>* Not requiring semicolons.<p>* Using braces or whitespace instead of &#x27;end&#x27; statements.<p>* Stuck with s-expressions since Lisp is more acceptable today (ala Clojure).<p>* <Your bikeshed here.><p>One of the Dylan designers, David Moon, went on design (but not implement) a new language with some differing takes on the syntax: <a href=""http://users.rcn.com/david-moon/PLOT3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://users.rcn.com/david-moon/PLOT3/</a> ... it is interesting, but without an implementation.<p>There&#x27;s also the question of whether Dylan failed due to the syntax. There were a lot of factors that led to Dylan not seeing the adoption that was desired:<p>* Java was a big factor.<p>* The financial troubles at Apple.<p>* The collapse of Harlequin. Harlequin had an implementation of Dylan that lives on today as Open Dylan, but had a very advanced IDE on Windows and a pretty solid foundation.<p>* The business model of Harlequin. Harlequin sold expensive commercial development tools. Lispworks lives on with that business model, but it can&#x27;t be said to be a massive success.<p>* The team at CMU switched to Java and away from their Gwydion Dylan implementation. (This was partly due to research dollars.)<p>And the failings of the Apple Dylan product itself didn&#x27;t help. It was late to market, buggy, slow, and lacked PowerPC support in the initial release.<p>Much of the above wasn&#x27;t due to or related to the syntax.<p>Yet despite all of that, Dylan still has a special place in my heart and that of many others. We&#x27;ve put out new releases, fixed a lot of bugs, improved platform portability and more in the last few years.

But on the other side there are people like Chris Landsea - here was his resignation letter from the IPCC:<p><a href=""http://cstpr.colorado.edu/prometheus/archives/science_policy_general/000318chris_landsea_leaves.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cstpr.colorado.edu/prometheus/archives/science_policy...</a><p>The IPCC&#x27;s charter is to tell us about <i>risks</i> related to climate change. Not the benefits. If there weren&#x27;t any risks or we were fully informed about them, the IPCC would have no institutional reason to continue to exist. So naturally it focuses on the latest big scary &quot;we just noticed THIS risk!&quot; stories and puts much less emphasis on &quot;it turns out we were wrong about THAT risk!&quot; stories. For all we know, each new report could be exactly the same as the last one in terms of the net overall danger documented and it would still <i>look</i> like things were &quot;getting worse&quot;, because areas where things are &quot;getting better&quot; generally aren&#x27;t mentioned or are soft-pedaled.<p>For instance, the IPCC once tried to claim a high certainty that there&#x27;d be more hurricanes in the future due to climate change (see Landsea&#x27;s letter linked above), but now they either don&#x27;t make such claims or assign them a much lower certainty level. The IPCC once claimed Himalayan glaciers would be gone by 2035 ( <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jan/20/ipcc-himalayan-glaciers-mistake"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jan/20/ipcc-hima...</a> ); that turned out to be a mistaken claim based on grey literature. If there were some sort of a rundown in each report listing all the ways things &quot;are worse&quot; AND all the ways things &quot;are better&quot; since the last one it&#x27;d be easy to keep score. But there isn&#x27;t, and the summaries and press releases emphasize any mentioned &quot;this is worse&quot; stories because bad news travels fast.<p>Suzuki complains that the IPCC report doesn&#x27;t focus on the loss of arctic sea ice, but if they DID mention sea ice, they might have to mention that overall sea ice levels worldwide are currently <i>above</i> the long-term (30 year) average because we&#x27;ve gained more sea ice cover in the antarctic than we&#x27;ve lost in the arctic. And so on. (Given a big, complicated planet you can always find SOME areas or trends that seem to be &quot;getting worse&quot; but that doesn&#x27;t mean throwing them - and only them - into the mix would make the report more accurate.)",1400749902

In any case, usage marks, like scratches, etc. just mean that you may not get a <i>full</i> refund.<p>Some retailers allow for longer periods; e.g. Amazon allows for a month instead of just two weeks.",1400749550

Rich people inevitably have the resources to buy power and the incentive to do so. Wealth begets power. Look at history.  Get rid of the rich.<p>The right think the problem is power. The powerful inevitably have the incentive to sell their power. Wealth begets power. Look at history. Get rid of the political power.<p>Both of these positions are trying to tie the political economy in a tidy bow. Set up a few meta rules and all else flows from that. Neither are in any way practical. Both ignore other things like political inevitabilities of a democracy.<p>So take and ideological libertarian. She believes a government should enforce contracts, arrest criminals and (maybe) build roads. How does having this utopian vision influence her position on <i>this</i> issue in this world?<p>It translates to some completely irrelevant, theoretical position. &quot;We shouldn&#x27;t need a law banning money in politics because money should have nothing to gain from being in politics.&quot; This is insane!. In <i>this</i> world, politicians <i>do</i> have power and money does have an interest in politics.<p>We can&#x27;t get rid of either wealth or power. Or, if you think we can, lets agree that we are not going to in the next couple of years. It <i>is</i>  possible make and enforce a law that says bribery is illegal and use an effective common sense definition of bribery. If you want to campaign for you libertarian revolution or a gradual reduction of taxes and government spending, that&#x27;s fine.<p>But, it is completely illogical to colour your position on what should be done now by what will or won&#x27;t be necessary in some unlikely future.<p>I&#x27;ll give you a corollary. I think that drugs should be legal worldwide. Good or bad, I think people have a right to ingest whatever they want and it&#x27;s inappropriate to put them in jail for such decisions. The demand for drugs can&#x27;t be stopped and criminalizing drugs creates enormous criminal industries.<p>In some producer and transit countries (eg Mexico), this global prohibition is causing an enormous harm, destabilizing the country with a lot of violence. The <i>solution</i>, in my opinion, is to decriminalize drugs worldwide. This might happen to some extent at some point, but it won&#x27;t happen in the next few years. Meanwhile, it makes sense for the Mexican government to do whatever they can to reduce the harm being caused now by drugs.<p>Their domestic policy on marijuana has little or no effect on the level of violence from the cartels. It&#x27;s not relevant.",1400749506

(That&#x27;s not particularly exciting, though: formalisations of philosophical arguments often crumble under the mathematician&#x27;s lens. Even the best ones!) They&#x27;re not exactly new, I&#x27;d say, but their rigour is refreshing. My key problem with the overall approach remains the shitty test set we have for any theory of consciousness. It ultimately consists of two elements. If we&#x27;re being generous, there&#x27;s three. Namely, almost everyone except for the philosophical extremist agrees that we are conscious and that a stone isn&#x27;t. IIT works quite well for these cases. Some people would include, say, a cat as a conscious being while maintaining that its &quot;level&quot; of consciousness is reduced. This boils down to<p><pre><code>  C_stone < [C_cat <] C_human\n</code></pre>\nwhich isn&#x27;t much. There&#x27;s no real hope for extending it. Any other cases like the ones Aaronson discusses are ones for which we don&#x27;t even have strong intuitions. Sure, we&#x27;d like to think that none of the entities he describes are in fact conscious. But if that&#x27;s the bullet I have to bite in order to get a decent theory of consciousness, then I might be OK with that.",1400749491

I presently reconcile this by subscribing in some degree to Strauss-Howe generational theory. It posits that we(in the USA) go through a crisis of up to 20 years roughly every 80 years. e.g. the last one was the start of the Depression through the end of WWII. And the present one most likely started around September 2008 when the GFC surfaced.<p>The downside of living in a crisis period is that nightmarish things are happening all around you. The upside is that coming out of it, the external-facing institutions of society are completely restructured to address the problems that caused that crisis.<p>And so I am motivated to do what I can to make sure that what we&#x27;re working with coming out of this crisis is as good as we can get it.<p>(Strauss and Howe are unfortunately also responsible for all those &quot;Millenials&quot; articles, but you take the bad with the good.)",1400749200

7650389,comment,7648893,7650146,2,0,wyager,,,"I didn&#x27;t want to go over my reasoning unless someone asked, since it&#x27;s kind of a long explanation.<p>The lack of generic support is really terrible. What you have to do instead (cast things to {}interface) is like casting things to Object and then hoping they have the right methods in Java, or passing things around as void* in C++ and then casting them. It&#x27;s basically the same type safety as a 100% dynamically typed language (i.e. almost none), but with a much uglier syntax.<p>Many features are built-in, non-extensible language directives. Take the `range` operator. `range` only supports built-in types like maps, slices, and chans. You want to range over a tree? Too bad. Want to range over a graph? Too bad. Want to range over a queue or a linked list? Hmm, well too bad, or maybe wrap the queue or LL with a chan, write a helper function, range over that, and watch your performance go to shit.<p>And for embedded programming tasks, like robotics, Go simply doesn&#x27;t have the right primitives. There isn&#x27;t a way to perform unsafe operations or pointer arithmetic (necessary for embedded programming), so you have to use cgo.<p>You also lose a lot of language features if you don&#x27;t have a heap. No chans, no maps, etc.<p>Considering that Go&#x27;s claim to fame is its suite of useful language features (like goroutines and easy-to-use chans) and standard library (with good web tools), neither of which are usable in most embedded contexts, and <i>certainly</i> not in real-time contexts, any advantages go might have kind of fly out the window.",1398484762

If a real-world identity <i>does</i> send junk mail, you block them. They can&#x27;t just go get another identity, so the block is actually useful. (Okay, you <i>can</i> steal identities, with money/underworld connections, but it&#x27;s unlikely to be profitable at scale.)<p>It would be orders of magnitude better than the current security model for financial transactions. Rather than simply hoping merchants will safeguard the magic numbers that are the <i>only</i> thing needed to drain customers&#x27; bank accounts, you could set it so that only the person in control of a government-issued ID associated with a bank account can spend money using that account. And that you don&#x27;t hand over your password to merchants - just use it to authorize transactions. Also, ideally, your government ID could have multiple factors like a physical token.<p>It would replace having to upload scans of ID documents, which is incredibly insecure both because of the risk of compromise - there are quite a number of things a malicious person can do with just that JPEG file - and because their security features are entirely physical - you can Photoshop someone else&#x27;s name into your passport pretty easily, and Coinbase/your bank won&#x27;t know the difference between that and the scan straight off a scanner.<p>Inevitably, people will hate this as a blow to anonymity/pseudoynmity, but there are already tons of applications which are inherently and/or deliberately not anonymous (like loans, credit cards, Bitcoin exchanges, etc.) and, if done right, this makes those services <i>way</i> less prone to fraud.

I would agree with the first couple of lines from Wikipedia:<p>> Nihilism (/ˈnaɪ.ɨlɪzəm/ or /ˈniː.ɨlɪzəm/; from the Latin nihil, nothing) is a philosophical doctrine that suggests the negation of one or more putatively meaningful aspects of life. Most commonly, nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism, which argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.<p>But this does not mean I don&#x27;t <i>enjoy</i> life, and <i>find</i> meaning for myself. I just don&#x27;t believe that there&#x27;s anything <i>objective</i> or <i>intrinsic</i> about it - that is, what gives my life meaning is what I make of it, and nothing else.<p>One could possibly argue that we derive meaning from our biology - the factors that evokes emotions, beauty, or drives our reward responses, and this represents &quot;objective meaning&quot; in some way, but I feel that&#x27;s a big stretch, though it is certainly likely to <i>shape</i> your thoughts on what is meaningful.",1398483269

Anyway, for me it isn&#x27;t important part about that. &quot;Genius&quot; is just a bold word after all, it means very little if anything at all. Somebody achieved something, or he hasn&#x27;t, that&#x27;s all. As it seems to this point with information we have this guy isn&#x27;t anything but somebody who behaves oddly after damaging his head, which isn&#x27;t big deal as I believe anybody would agree. Yet if he&#x27;s loud enough, journals are taking interviews with him, and links to these interviews are posted on HN, and people discuss that magical phenomena with excitement, and he writes a book, and somebody probably buys this book, and somebody with degree in neuroscience writes dubious paper about that and people call it scientifically proven, and some other journalist writes long but pointless article about that, and so on, so on, so on… And even if there was actually something interesting about his case, it&#x27;s pretty hard to see it now, after all that &quot;mathematical marvel&quot; screaming, especially when no real facts given. I find it sad and much more important than if he is actually a &quot;marvel&quot; or he isn&#x27;t.",1398483111

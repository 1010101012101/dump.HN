It has ""normal"" Mac keybindings set in addition to the Emacs ones for most operations, and comes with many of the best Emacs packages already installed.<p>Heck, even if you know Emacs well, give Aquamacs a try.  All of the pre-installed packages can be a big time saver over downloading and installing each of them individually.",1210971505

192220,comment,191480,191480,0,0,gcv,,,"I took a look at Scala about six months ago. It's quite a nice, full-featured language, and is a real contender for anyone forced to deploy to the JVM. However, it has a lot, and I do mean a whole hell of a lot of growing up to do before I'd actually use it for anything.<p>Its support for editors and tools was pretty horrible. The Eclipse plugin outright sucked (bundled compiler lagging behind the language release, syntax highlighting which came and went unpredictably, weird compilation errors which didn't matter --- and when I submitted a bug report ticket, the Scala team took four months to respond). I tried the Emacs mode, but it had such flaky indentation that I didn't know what it was doing half the time. If I absolutely had to use Scala, I'm sure I'd fix the Emacs mode, but it just wasn't worthwhile back then.<p>In addition, the language changes rapidly in ways which break existing code (I ran into an incompatible change in the Actors library, but don't remember the details any more). Granted, that's actually a good thing, because it means that the developers do not want to be stuck with bad design decisions from the past, but I'd like to be able to write production code, too. Since it seems that Scala's authors use it as a testbed for their research in languages, I have my doubts that it'll stabilize quite enough. (Counterarguments welcome!)",1210971185

Using emacs without my .emacs file can be as disorienting as using another editor.<p>Not sure if you're thinking of TextMate or TextWrangler.  TextWrangler does have a Mac-like UI and uses Apple-style keyboard shortcuts.  TextMate's UI is not particularly Mac-like, it exposes shell commands quite directly, and most of the macros are shell/ruby/etc scripts.<p>To illustrate the difference, TextWrangler has a menu command to sort the current document, and a menu command to remove duplicate lines.  TextMate has ""Filter Through Command"" which lets you apply arbitrary command like ""sort | uniq"" to the current document.",1210971062

The editor itself is nice, it handles multiple files and interacts with Finder pretty well and the syntax coloring works well.  I created a syntax definition myself which was also easy.<p>I also like the easy shortcuts for moving text blocks, commenting, chopping, conversion, etc.  I'd say try it out, then buy TextMate if you don't get what you need from Smultron.",1210970666

192208,comment,191848,192116,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'm not sure I'm convinced of this, in the case of Asus (or Gigabyte or Intel, who have sponsored some LinuxBIOS/Coreboot projects in the past).  Asus, with their Eee PC, are striking out into delightfully new territory, and an instant on feature would be a pretty killer thing.  Traditional BIOS makes that impossible, because it's so damned slow and changing it is, as you note, practically impossible.<p>But just because the BIOS software companies (who are, on the whole, separate from the motherboard manufactures) don't want to rewrite their software, it doesn't mean some motherboard manufacturer won't jump ship one day.  In fact, I would argue that it's inevitable, if the BIOS manufacturers don't get their act together fast--people are beginning to expect a completely different experience from their devices.  The iPhone and similar devices are training people that real computers can turn on instantly and be ready for work in seconds.  No reason PCs can't be similarly fast to boot.",1210970445

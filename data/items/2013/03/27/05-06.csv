This is taken from the amazon link you provided:<p>Recently, there have been questions about the accuracy of some parts of this book. At this time, Tantor Media will continue to make it available to our customers, but we wanted to make you aware of the issues. Here is a statement from the hardcover publisher of the book, Henry Holt and Company:""It is with deep regret that Henry Holt and Company announces that we will no longer print, correct or ship copies of Charles Pellegrino's The Last Train from Hiroshima due to the discovery of dishonest sources of information for the book. It is easy to understand how even the most diligent author could be duped by a source, but we also understand that this opens that book to very detailed scrutiny. The author of any work of non-fiction must stand behind its content. We must rely on our authors to answer questions that may arise as to the accuracy of their work and reliability of their sources. Unfortunately, Mr. Pellegrino was not able to answer the additional questions that have arisen about his book to our satisfaction.""The Last Train from Hiroshima offers listeners a stunning ""you are there"" time capsule, gracefully wrapped in elegant prose. Charles Pellegrino's scientific authority and close relationship with the A-bomb's survivors make his account the most gripping and authoritative ever written.At the narrative's core are eyewitness accounts of those who experienced the atomic explosions firsthand-the Japanese civilians on the ground and the American fliers in the air. Thirty people are known to have fled Hiroshima for Nagasaki-where they arrived just in time to survive the second bomb. One of them, Tsutomu Yamaguchi, is the only person who experienced the full effects of the cataclysm at ground zero both times. The second time, the blast effects were diverted around the stairwell in which Yamaguchi had been standing, placing him and a few others in a shock cocoon that offered protection, while the entire building disappeared around them.Pellegrino weaves spellbinding stories together within a narrative that challenges the ""official report,"" showing exactly what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki-and why.",1364363527

Law/Science is around but it's a bit of a stepchild.<p>I studied the LLB part-time for 4 years, so I wound up with a half-degree worth of debt. If I'd gotten my shit together I'd have been able to grab a graduate-entry LLB in about a year by carrying credit, but it was long enough ago now that those credits have largely expired.

E-books are often not really yours, and DRM makes that doubly true. The risk of loss with e-books is significantly higher than with physical books.",1364361036

According to your numbers, the tax burden relative to the level of service is at most about 12 times worse than other countries, though the fact that Medicare covers the people who most need expensive care means it's actually much closer to international costs. It's certainly <i>effective</i> in that it does provide a lot of care for a lot of people, and it's about as efficient as it can be without completely revamping the supply chain it depends on.",1364360826

The government provides essential services (decentralized up to the district level) like education, water, streets, police, health care, social security for it's citizens.<p>I'd rather have clean water and unbiased police and justice and free education. Every private company needs to maximize their own profit. The government does not need to do this. They can subsidize important but nonprofitable projects. This can be and has been made efficient.<p>There is no interest in a private prison company to reduce crime. There is also not much reason for a private rail company to invest in infrastructure that not profitable. But as a citizen I have an interest to use a efficient train.<p>It's not black and white. Private sector is very good at a lot of things. But there are certain other things that are natural monopolies or important for the functioning of the society that in my opinion can be best served by an efficient government.<p>The private sector and capitalism do not also not always work in your interest - Adam Curtis from the BBC (also government :) did a great documentation about certain effects of free market radicalism: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mayfair_Set"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mayfair_Set</a>",1364360767

The costs are $1 billion for the tower, $100 million for the pipeline, and desal plants are about a $1b a piece these days.

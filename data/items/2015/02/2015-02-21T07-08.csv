The 787, for its carbon fiber fuselage and advanced computing system, and the A380, for its sheer size, come to mind. If a measure of the import of new technology in aviation is whether it&#x27;s replicated across future designs, then the 787 definitely qualifies. Both its carbon fiber technology and computing technology are in the process of being adapted to new (future) applications as we speak.",1424505554

Does the company press for reform laws?<p>How would such a company be treated if it was looking for drug buyers and sellers? Especially if such a company didn&#x27;t encourage legalization but appeared to stand with Christian groups? What steps are they taking to ensure innocent people are <i>not</i> being prosecuted with their tools? Going by current laws is no moral compass.<p>Finally, if they or the anti trafficking groups want to be taken seriously, provide real stats. This is from their Twitter account:<p>&quot;39,000 escort ads were posted on the #Louisiana Backpage since July. How many are sex trafficking victims?&quot;<p>Well, I don&#x27;t know, why don&#x27;t you tell us? They&#x27;ve got big data and LE, but they post leading questions like that with apparently no followup.<p>It&#x27;s like saying X number of people OD on heroin. For any X we should figure out A: if current legislation is helping or hurting that number, B: is infringing on the rights and potentially destroying people&#x27;s lives worth the cost? I&#x27;m sure it feels great to save 100 people from OD&#x27;ing. Does that mean it&#x27;s OK to imprison millions?<p>I know this probably comes off making me look terrible. And I don&#x27;t know anything except this article and reading the company&#x27;s Twitter account. But it feels slightly off, as if I&#x27;m being convinced of a problem without seeing all the numbers. Where&#x27;re the calls for legalization and regulation?

Ignoring the fact that this is basically an optimistic list of synonyms for &quot;naive&quot;, if you believe that line of horse hockey you are likely one of the naive college kids being taken advantage of (or wish you were).<p>It&#x27;s a real shame because startups could benefit <i>greatly</i> from the mature leadership available out in big bad &quot;corporate America&quot;.

9085011,comment,9080896,9084564,0,0,krylon,,,"Thanks for the advice!<p>I agree on the math part (which is the biggest problem for me, since I do not exactly have a strong math background). Haskell requires one to think in very different ways from C or similar languages (compared to the difference to Haskell, the structured (C) vs. OO (say, Python or Ruby) difference seems negligible. If one already knows C++, learning the basics of Java is trivial (the main problem becomes learning about the standard library plus third party libraries). If one knows C/C++ and a Unix shell, learning Perl is at least manageable (is that how you spell that word?).<p>Lisp fans like to refer to their language of choice as something akin to Alien technology, but again, compared to Haskell, Lisp feels much more &quot;terrestrial&quot; (Common Lisp and Emacs Lisp, at least, my knowledge of Scheme is rather limited).<p>Now that I think about it, the real problem for me seems to be monads. Without having /some/ kind of side effects, you cannot write an even remotely useful program, and I never really got them. I once had the feeling I was really close, but then the toy program I was working on blew up in my face, thereby telling me I had probably not been as close as I had thought.<p>Another thing about Haskell (and - as far as I can tell, OCaml) that is /very/ different from the mainstream crowd of languages is the type system. I have a feeling that an idiomatic Haskell program would make <i>far</i> heavier use of the type system to model your problem than even extreme examples of object-oriented design (and without becoming as confusing as the more class-hierarchy-happy OO programs I have seen). 
(Let me stress that I really adore Haskell&#x27;s type system. If there was a conventional structured programming language with a type system like Haskell&#x27;s, I would probably be all over it, as would many other programmers, I guess. I have wondered on occasion if you could have one without the other (immutability and such).)<p>Maybe I&#x27;ll retcon learning Haskell on my list of New Year&#x27;s resolutions. In all fairness, understanding Lisp took me about three to four years of looking at it once or twice a year, and understanding how pointers work in C also took me a lot longer than I am comfortable admitting. ;-) I can be very persistent if I really want to know something.",1424504314

It would only make sense if they agree that your investment only goes through if the 2M does. VCs love doing that. If they agree, then yes, I wouldn&#x27;t consider the 3% a super unfair deal. But you still need to ask for employee equity @3%-10% depending on how critical to them you&#x27;d be. And I&#x27;m not even considering the money they owe you.

It&#x27;s more the ecosystem and some cultural aspects that bothered me. To take a symmetrical example, JavaScript has great tooling and community despite being a language with countless flaws. 
Over the years, Python and Ruby ecosystem have gotten pretty OK. Go, Clojure and Elixir are younger and have learned from previous languages, their tooling is not as extensive but they&#x27;re starting on firmer ground. I&#x27;m not sure how to define what makes a well polished software development environment, it&#x27;s a good question really. I suppose one could write books about subject. But Haskell gave me a fuzzy feeling that things were cumbersome and sometimes buggy. Package management was the show stopper for me. I&#x27;m glad Haskell exists and people enjoy coding in it but for me after a while it wasn&#x27;t that fun so I went to do other things. My arguments are shallow and are more like opinions, but if you care to spread Haskell usage, maybe you can hear them nonetheless.<p>>> I was disappointed because I was attracted by referential integrity, strong compiler checks, pattern matching and function composition

Rather than work in a clearly-defined formal system where every inference step is justified by some axiom, the goal of most mathematical work is to produce human-readable arguments aimed at other mathematicians, arguments that could &quot;in theory&quot; be turned into formal proofs, but are not ultimately formal proofs themselves.  Granted, even these &quot;informal&quot; proofs are more rigorous and detailed than virtually any argument seen outside of mathematics.<p>Furthermore, these informal proofs are written in standard, linear prose (interspersed with copious mathematical terms and symbols of course) because again the focus is on communicating the ideas, not on justifying every individual step.",1434318992

I do feel, however, that a new format might be the best way to go<p>This is actually already the case. The original man(7) language (actually a set of macros for troff) has been around since the early 70s and was part of Unix since the beginning. It’s a simple language but entirely presentation‐focused, so it’s not helpful for semantic manipulation.<p>Modern manpages should be written in mdoc(7), another troff macro set that’s both more semantic and more expressive than man(7). mdoc(7) was first developed in 1989 for BSD and has been the standard documentation format there ever since, and is fairly common in Linux software as well (although there’s still a large contingent using the old, non‐semantic man(7) macros).<p>A lot of mandoc’s power comes from the semantic ability of mdoc(7) manpages, including the ability to search by flags/options/environment variables/whatever, and the ability to convert to semantic HTML5.

Here&#x27;s the situation:<p>- African countries have been loaned money through IMF on the conditions that they reform their systems (both economical and political reforms) to better suit western ideals. There&#x27;s a reason why we speak about neo-colonialism<p>- China comes in, says &quot;Here&#x27;s the money you need, and some more. You can do whatever you want with your economy and your politics. You just have to pay back and vote for us at the UN&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s a <i>massive</i> improvements for these countries. At last, they get to do what they want. At last, they are considered as adults, not as children that can&#x27;t have a country because big brother west does not like the rules. So, I&#x27;d say african countries much prefer China foreign aid than Western aid.<p>> I am saying that the US citizenry has a consistent reputation for dispatching the most and most effective aid to developing countries and disaster regions around the globe.<p>Absolutely not. Only the western countries want to export their democracy and individual liberties ideal to all countries. China on the other hand has demonstrated that they are not interested in changing other countries. Just look at chinese history. Also have a look at their current foreign policy: their number one rule is &quot;no ingerence&quot;. This is the reason why they are so liked by atrocious regimes and disliked by our western countries: they don&#x27;t do anything to stop human atrocities and we hate them for that. I have no reason to believe that this situation would change were the US to somehow disappear.<p>> Ditto for Russia<p>I don&#x27;t have many elements to say it would be the same for Russia, but I&#x27;m inclined to believe the same thing: Russia also likes the &quot;no-ingerence&quot; mantra (provided it&#x27;s not in their own country)<p>> The only country, IMO, that could replace the US as well as maintain the semblance of &quot;a force for good&quot; is India.<p>You seem to forget about <i>all</i> western countries that are not the US. Europe would be a far better &quot;force for good&quot; than any other country.<p>>  I believe this because they too are a democracy. I am not a blind believer in democracy, but i do believe it is better then totalitarian governments.<p>If you still believe China is a totalitarian country, you should do well to read up on what&#x27;s actually happening there. There is a <i>huge</i> difference between Stalin-level or Mao-level totalitarism and current China totalitarism. Sure, chinese people don&#x27;t have the same individual liberties we have here in the west, but it&#x27;s still not as horrible as you may imagine. In short, there&#x27;s only one thing you can&#x27;t do: ask whether the communist party is the best thing you can have for a goverment.

We hear about 2 or 3 horrible stories and it seems like every tourist who enters the country is harassed by immigration. I totally understand the concern when one hears these stories though, it&#x27;s important to keep in mind how incredibly rarely they have occurred.<p>I would say your chances of immigration even looking twice at your laptop are extremely small. When they want to look at any electronic device, generally the only thing they want to see is for you to turn on the power to prove that it is an actual working device and not just an empty case with explosive materials inside it. They have no interest in whatever data you have on the device.<p>Exceptions might be if you are involved in high profile, anti-US politics or you suspect there is some reason you would be a person of interest to the US homeland security. Or if you are entering illegally, planning to overstay your visa or doing anything which you feel you will have to lie to immigration as you enter the country. In those cases I would be concerned entering any country, not just the US.",1434317385

Given a set of well-stated limitations (like, cannot use more than N^x bytes of storage for an instance of size N, using the same standard library of data structures etc) we can make meaningful comparisons. I could come along with a method that uses O(n log n) memory and crushes this (maybe) - how do we declare a winner now, without some sort of context?",1434315974

Kevin Rose took quite a lot of money off the table and it could be argued that's when the Digg lost it's visionary leader. Kevin seemed to shift his focus away from building a successful company towards investing and advising other companies. I think it's hard to argue he did the wrong thing on a personal level, but for the company it was devastating. I think allowing a founder to take SOME (enough to not worry about personal finances) money off the table is reasonable for an entrepreneur that's reached some level of success. But it's an entirely different story to allow a venture-backed founder to take a sizable amount of cash off the table, enough to greatly reduce any incentive to build a company worthy of a successful exit or an IPO.",1337604894

I can't remember the exact figure but I think that economists drop capital utility by a factor of 10 for each zero.

4002570,comment,3995527,3997104,2,0,_djo_,,,"Sure, it's undoubtedly true that in certain industrial and technological spheres South Africa produced far more impressive and interesting projects during Apartheid. Even though there was some outside assistance, the developments produced in the country during this period were extraordinarily innovative and advanced in relative terms.<p>Acknowledging that interesting developments came about in that period does necessarily justify Apartheid or lessen its immoral nature. Just as (not to invoke Godwin, the systems were totally different) we can acknowledge the amazing technology that German engineers and scientists invented during the Second World War without endorsing Nazi ideology.<p>With regards to the question of whether RSA is a less interesting science and engineering power, it's complex. Certainly, when it comes to state-funded R&D, especially in defence and space, then yes it's true. The defence industry, while still innovative and very advanced in certain niche areas, has shrunk significantly since Apartheid, shedding many skills and leaving many defence industry companies in precarious financial positions. This is a result of the huge cuts in defence spending since 1990, which gutted the industry. That level of funding would never have been sustainable in a democracy with a universal franchise and serious socio-economic problems though.<p>To some extent the non-defence private sector suffered too as state R&D dried up almost entirely. It's important to understand that with the trade sanctions of the late 1980s it was state funding and the mining industry which drove most R&D and many companies weren't able to transition to a market-based approach when that stopped. Imagine the impact on the US high-technology scene were US government research funding to be yanked almost overnight from universities and private companies.<p>Yet there are some encouraging developments, with private companies continuing to try to innovate using private capital. The satellite design and construction industry has re-established itself and is growing fairly well, as are other space-based industries especially astronomy where South Africa is one of the world leaders. Similarly there is small but rapidly-growing tech scene that's creating some interesting things, with two prominent examples being the development of Amazon's EC2 system and Mark Shuttleworth's Thawte Consulting. Mobile telecoms are another interesting area, while there are some aerospace firms doing well, such as Aerosud which is a single-source supplier for both Airbus and Boeing on safety-critical parts.<p>R&D spending still remains low compared to other countries at South Africa's level but there are signs that that, too is changing. So we'll have to see what the future brings.",1337604578

The point of markdown is that its simple for humans to read and write directly, which isn't applicable here.<p>The downside to markdown should be obvious:<p>* more code, both server and client-side (to implement the to-and-from conversion)<p>* more bugs (due to more code and the complexity of escaping valid input that happens to be markup in one or the other)<p>* less features (if the editor supports some html that doesn't map 1-to-1 to markdown, you're in trouble)<p>* less future-proof/platform independent (html isn't going anywhere, but that markdown variant you're using with the custom extensions you needed might be subtly different in whatever language/platform/toolkit you'd prefer in 5 years).<p>Html is by far the better choice.  If there's an improvement to be had here, it's in using the (compatible) XHTML5 serialization to ease parsing.

But i want to offer a different perspective for consideration other than ""this is evil"".<p>As a developer of apps, you provide software that tries to fulfill a specific need of some subset of users (in other words, it's not merely an uber-fart-generator). You genuinely build this app to the best of your ability and push it to the app store. Users trickle in, based on the app description and find that, for example, it lacks polish or it doesn't have feature X yet, which is relevant to the app's domain and to the user, but is not currently implemented. In other words, there is a mismatch between user expectations and the app-provided experience.<p>Instinctively, these users feel the urge to leave a negative rating. It's a knee-jerk reaction. As a developer, I want the user to engage me, because obviously I have an app that is not quite there yet. I want the user to tell me what they want fixed before leaving a negative review, so that i can satisfy their needs without burying the app. By funneling him into such a feedback loop, I can better my app and in turn help him fulfill his needs best.<p>Is this unethical, or evil?

As in anotherdeaf's story[0], if I'm at a pub or MacDonald's or something, and they know I've not heard something they will quickly step in to sort it out. None of them get embarrassed or anything when I asked them to repeat what someone else said, and all of them are happy to say the same thing over and over until I've got it -- I guess what I'm trying to say is that when you've found your friends and trained them up, they'll stick right by you. People always ask me how I got to be so confident, but the truth is I'm really not, I'm always terrified of meeting new people but I put myself out there and make a huge effort to talk to them, ask questions and just get on with them in general. It is horrible and I'm always exhausted afterward, but the rewards make it worth it. Just stick at it, talk to people, and you'll be good to go.<p>Have you taken lipreading classes ever? If not, you should definitely consider it. It means that I can happily talk to people in swimming pools, e.t.c., when I can't wear my hearing aid.<p>Insofar as work is concerned, I've never had any issues with special arrangements for interviews -- I tend to email recruiters directly, but IBM, Google and Twitter (as well as other smaller companies) have been more than happy to make special arrangements for me. Always, always ask, the only tip I would give you is to put an obviously fake telephone number in (e.g., 000000000).<p>Oh, and don't worry about the girls. If they're worth it then they will come to you :) And definitely have kids. Even if they ARE deaf, they will still get a lot out of life, and things have been improving so much since I was at primary school all those years ago.<p>Also if (any of) you want to just shoot shit or have someone to chat to about deaf stuff, my email address is in my bio, so feel free to send me an email or add me on gtalk.<p>[0] <a href=""http://hackerne.ws/item?id=4002231"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackerne.ws/item?id=4002231</a><p>EDIT: (Also I have just sent out that article and links to some of the comments in here to my best friends, partly as a way to say thanks to them for all the trouble they've put in for me over the years, and also to help them understand where I'm coming from some of the time.)",1337602090

Since it is OSS and aside from Microsoft&#x27;s J++ lawsuit, Sun was pretty liberal about how people used Java (as they mostly profited from value adds, rather than the core language or libraries).<p>If Sun were still around, I suspect not only would they not be suing Google, but they would be actively involved in the Android development scene, producing tooling and other assists and offering enterprise support.<p>Oracle are just evil™",1439477994

And &quot;less so&quot; != &quot;completely the opposite of&quot;. And further, obviously, learning a trade isn&#x27;t millions and millions of dollars worth of capital, nor does it instantly catapault you into the leagues of the wealthy, just because you learned how to fix plumbing or write code.

Military experience is not seeked out like it was in the past.<p>Being  a soldier and being a Cop are take different skill sets.

It should because you served your country, and need a job when you get home.  Most of you are intelligent enough to realize civilian police departments should not be run like 
military operations.  I do cringe when I hear, usually ex-marines talk/think they will be shoe-ins when they get home and apply to the academy.

The more progressive departments are changing training procedures as I write this, at least that&#x27;s what I heard.

The state of the art in full frame sensors is just under 15-bits of dynamic range. So to <i>equal</i> it an 8-bit sensor would need to be able to count resets at least 128 times AND be able to do this in 1/8000 of a second, at the same sensel density and efficiency! Don&#x27;t hold your breath.<p><a href=""http://www.dxomark.com/Cameras/Nikon/D810"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dxomark.com/Cameras/Nikon/D810</a><p>(I&#x27;d also suggest that trends towards using multiple sensors to assemble high resolution images will easily blow this away since they can use high- and low- sensitivity sensors to synthesize more dynamic range and resolution. Also see recent Olympus patents to capture polarization data at the same time.)<p>BTW: assuming they can do this stuff, they presumably can read the sensor pretty darn fast — so they should be able to eliminate image &quot;tearing&quot; in digital video and the need for mechanical shutters altogether. That&#x27;s probably a bigger issue than dynamic range.<p>I suspect that clearing a well in < 1/10,000,000 of a second (which would only lose 10% of the photon detection time during a 1/8000s exposure) is going to be tough. Assuming 25% of the sensel real estate needs to be sacrificed to the modulo circuitry, that&#x27;s a loss of 32.5% of photon data which is about the same loss as for pellicle mirrors (as seen in Sony&#x27;s pretty unsuccessful SLT cameras) for a feature that won&#x27;t be much use in many situations.",1439476970

Every major revision from 6->7->8, breaks literally every module and every third party piece of code. I&#x27;m <i>months</i> into migrating our website from 6 to 7 (I&#x27;m the only person working on the migration, and my PHP experience is somewhat limited). Many common modules provide no usable upgrade path, even if there is a version for both 6 and 7 (which is often not the case). And, there seems to be no inclination on the part of Drupal core developers to alter this course, or even recognition that it&#x27;s a horrible user experience.<p>According to some conversations I&#x27;ve had with folks, Drupal 8 seems to be even worse than Drupal 7, and Drupal 7 is literally the worst upgrade experience I&#x27;ve ever had. Piles of new jargon and new APIs get introduced in every new release, and often replaces or subsumes entire swaths of similar functionality in previous releases (e.g. nodes -> entities), and Drupal was already ridiculously jargon-heavy to the point of documentation making no sense to someone without extensive experience with the specific ways they use terminology, and googling generic terms like &quot;node&quot; and &quot;entity&quot; is a laughably unhelpful process.<p>I have, at many points in this process, thought: &quot;Fuck everything about this, I&#x27;m migrating to WordPress.&quot; I probably should have done so the first time I thought that, as it would be done by now. But, every time I made it over another hump in the upgrade, I thought, &quot;Surely that was the worst of it.&quot; and kept slogging along. Upgrading WordPress is literally a no-brainer, now...you just get emails every week or two saying, &quot;Your website has been updated to the latest version of WordPress.&quot; Sometimes, you click the &quot;upgrade database&quot; button.<p>Sorry to rant.

Now, in a rape case, without the cooperation and testimony of the victim it is very hard to present enough evidence to convict a jury that the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime&#x27;s elements were all present.<p>If rape was defined just be whether or not the victim felt it was rape, the victim could change their mind after-the-fact and Assange would go from not-rapist to rapist (and possibly to not-rapist again) based on not on their own actions by based on someone&#x27;s feelings of guilt, anger, intimidation, or forgiveness a month from the act. This only makes any sense if you view crimes as being individual injuries to one person. But that isn&#x27;t how criminal law works. If I walk up to you in the middle of a hackathon and stab you in the forearm, I have indeed harmed you and you can sue me for damages in civil court. However, I have also harmed society, specifically that part of society where people assume they can go to hackathon a without being stabbed.<p>A great source to learn about the fundamentals of criminal law and criminal procedure is this page maintained by a former prosecutor who now works as s defense attorney in NYC. <a href=""http://lawcomic.net/guide/?page_id=5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lawcomic.net/guide/?page_id=5</a><p>All of this should also apply on a smaller scale to communities with Codes of Conduct: <a href=""http://thebias.com/2015/08/12/take-responsibility-for-handling-abuse/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thebias.com/2015/08/12/take-responsibility-for-handli...</a><p>EDIT: I am not a lawyer and comments from a random person on the Internet do not establish an a attourney-client relationship.

My opinion: Want to seriously reduce CO2? Stop eating meat <i>and</i> have fewer children <i>and</i> limit spend on products to $1k / year <i>and</i> limit spend on services to $2k / year <i>and</i> don&#x27;t fly on planes <i>and</i> encourage everyone around you to take similarly progressive measures <i>and</i> apply pressure to your local political representatives <i>and</i> rejig our ideas regarding how to run society...<p>That said, &quot;the best is the enemy of the good&quot;.

To make this new sensor, you need to cram 50 million sets (50mp is state of the art) of voltage comparator/charge reset/digital counter circuits onto the CCD, and for N bits of rollover accuracy they need to be able to trigger, erase the charge, and resume exposure at least N times during the exposure time E (which is say 1/500th of a second, since they&#x27;re complaining about movement during multiple HDR exposures).  Practically speaking the trigger/operation/resume period must be significantly less than E/N since I see no way to retain the exposure during the period when the charge well is being drained to zero.  If this time is non-trivial, that translates to losing the fine bits of your ADC accuracy.<p>In their image they compare a 13-stop exposure (the current state of the art) to an 8-stop exposure (state of the art in 1900).  So assuming they didn&#x27;t just pull a photoshop out of their ass, they are overall claiming a 5 stop increase from state of the art.  That&#x27;s 5 extra bits of recovery (1 stop is double the range, i.e. an extra bit), so they think they can trigger the reset circuit 5 times during an exposure.  That implies this circuit must have a minimum cycle time of 1/2500th of a second (practically speaking a lot less to give time for the actual exposure).  With this math I&#x27;m also assuming that the comparator is perfect and doesn&#x27;t lose any accuracy - variance in trigger threshold or trigger time translates to losing some of your accuracy again.  They also need to generate little enough waste heat to avoid hot pixels (this is a major reason the ADC is on the image processor rather than the CCD), and you need 50 million sets of these on the CCD.<p>If you can do it then go for it.  It&#x27;s a nice idea on paper but I think there&#x27;s a lot of physical obstacles to overcome.  If it were that easy someone would have done it already.  It&#x27;s especially difficult given that reading out the sensor is <i>destructive</i> - measuring it wipes the charge, so I&#x27;m not sure how any of this would work at all given that.<p>Now what would actually be interesting is to apply the image-processing techniques to dual-DR imaging, as they mention in their &quot;related works&quot; section.  The open-source Magic Lantern firmware for Canon DSLRs allows you to scan alternating rows at different ISOs, so effectively you can capture a lot more dynamic range at the expense of your vertical resolution.  It&#x27;s all volunteers and they probably haven&#x27;t applied all the fancy image-processing magic with the convolutions and the hippity-hop rap music.  How about reconstructing those overexposed lines instead?  Or working on some of the sensors with physical implementations of dual-DR?",1439475156

But because its enterprise value to revenue multiple is way, way out of whack with respect to normal companies, it&#x27;s a pretty safe bet that there&#x27;s a lot of expectations priced in to the stock. That&#x27;s not inherently a bad thing, and in fact it is normal for young companies, but what it really means is that much of the growth potential of Tesla is &quot;priced in&quot; to the share price, meaning that if you buy TSLA at current prices, it may not rise all that much in the event they are wildly successful. If they are anything less than that, the share price could drop dramatically.<p>Tesla right now is a bet that their battery technology will be insanely profitable and have some sustainable advantage over competing technologies. It&#x27;s an interesting stock to play with as part of an algo strategy because it&#x27;s so volatile (again, this is typical of young companies), but I wouldn&#x27;t own TSLA as a buy-and-hold right now. The share price is just too expensive, and they&#x27;re going to need massive, continued infusions of capital to continue (as evidenced by the article).<p>Basically, the risk with Tesla is that if they are crazy profitable, their share price likely won&#x27;t rise all that much because investor expectations are high.

Oracle licenses can be very expensive, but migrating and rewriting and retesting working code can be even more expensive!<p>Also, Oracle is pretty good at achieving vendor lock-in.  For example they introduced a rapid web application development platform called &quot;Apex&quot; [1] about a decade ago and shipped it with every Oracle database (even the &quot;free&quot; Oracle Express Edition).  In my experience, developers who use it tend to like it, it <i>does</i> achieve rapid development, and there&#x27;s really nothing else like it outside of Oracle.  Once an organization has Apex apps, though, there&#x27;s no migration path to Postgres that doesn&#x27;t involve completely redeveloping the Apex applications from scratch.<p>Finally, despite all of the ways in which Oracle seems to be business and developer unfriendly, for a developer or DBA trained and experienced and entrenched in the Oracle ecosystem (and for whom license costs and sales tactics are not a concern), it&#x27;s really not such a bad place to be IMHO.

I have not signed or accepted any contract from the recruiter beyond period and day rate for the work.
My understanding is that the client did sign a contract with the recruiter, details of which I don&#x27;t know.<p>Fast forward a while.<p>The client approached me directly, asking If im available to do more work, which I was and we agreed a day rate and a period with the client.
As the contract finished, the recruiter found out that I was working directly to the client and swiftly got in touch with them.<p>From what I hear they are planning to/have inflated my agreed rate with the client and charged them for my work.
-----
Now I understand that the client has breached the contract they had with the recruiter by hiring me directly, which opens the client up for legal action - not a great position to be in.
I can sympathetic they just want the problem to go away and get on with their life.
However, this leaves me with in a difficult situation as well, with my earnings for the past 2 months gone.<p>Client now maintains radio silence, not answering emails or phone calls. I have not spoken to the recruiter yet, wanted to get some advice on HN before I do so.<p>My understanding is that client and recruiter can settle the broken contract through legal means or settle out of court.
The recruiter however should not be able to charge for my work (correct me if im wrong), an agreement that was made between me and the client irrespective of their previous contract, as that would constitute as fraud.<p>Not sure what do now, any advice would be greatly appreciated!",1439474745

Being an apologist for a broken culture doesn’t help that culture, nor the context in which it operates.<p>If you choose to pretend that outsider art is all good and outsider science is all bad, and that the culture of art, science and math ( and tech ) are beyond reproach, and that the points raised have no value as opportunities to create improvements, and that scientists ( or mathematicians, or the establishment ) are poor fake victims who are suffering hardship for considering whether their cultures possess opportunities for improvement, if this is the case then I can understand how pretending that seems to make it easier for you, since you can hold to an unchallenged perspective and not experience the disruption that comes with questioning the lay of the land under your feet. Tho that choice isn&#x27;t as likely to lead to reflection, as being open to questioning. And without reflection, no improvement.<p>And without questioning, no science.<p>Science is inspiring. Science isn&#x27;t about protecting yourself from reflection, science is brave, science embraces reflection and self critical thinking, and science embraces belief in the face of the unknown, science embraces acknowledging the unknown, and running the experiment. Science embraces the question. Science is the opposite of dogmatic. Anything that claims to be science and shies away from openness, is the mere color of science.<p>Science is that very ideal : that strength is open vulnerability, and not dogmatic inflexibility.
Science is an inspiration.<p>I believe the very sensitivity of these comments ( and the fact that they created the accusation in their interpreting, fabricating a connection to an accusation that was not stated ) reveals clearly that this issue is on people’s minds, and that in expectation of it being raised, and in expectation of its raising being troubling, they are not only defending against it, they are prematurely defending against it, and creating themselves the accusation that was not present and which they have hallucinated in their fear of it.<p>To be afraid of something is to suspect it.<p>So the very ideas I have raised have triggered this apparition to be conjured in these minds giving life and proof to the very questions I raised, and expanding the scope of relevance of the critique. It&#x27;s not just about maths, clearly. It&#x27;s about science as a whole. The argument was never &quot;could this occur?&quot; for we all know it could, and we have seen it, as have we all seen the kind of reflexive apologist rhetoric get triggered that was triggered here in denial of anything wrong with these culture’s held beyond question. The argument instead was a warning against the very defensiveness seen triggered in response to it, and a warning put now in clearer relief against the background of comments that display that very inflexibility and refusal of critical questioning that can lead to the exclusionist frightened culture warned about.<p>These comments are then nothing except my loyal supporters, they stand beside my warning as additional support for its importance, and in them we can see how the beginnings of dogmatic inflexibility take hold : through defensive denial of divergent ideas and refusal to question the conventional.<p>Let the ad-hoc groups of intellectual collaborators be like democratic meritocracies not frightened fascist states.",1439474484

However, it all depends on your personal use case and because of that Linux just isn&#x27;t an option for most people. If you value gaming you can fine tune wine till the cow comes home ... it will never feel (always) right. If you&#x27;re into music production Linux gives you another &quot;screw you!&quot; Then, there is this huge amount of software for which it <i>seems</i> as if Linux offers reasonable alternatives. But if you really consider what a user actually wants Linux doesn&#x27;t cut it. For example, Word could be replaced with Libre Office or (my personal favorite) an intriguing combination of markdown and pandoc. If, however, Word is what you <i>want</i> to use (even though I do not understand that) then every click that is different poses as a minor frustration that together with all the other minor frustrations adds up to a huge disappointment.",1439474404

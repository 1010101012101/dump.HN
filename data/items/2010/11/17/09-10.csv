1913679,comment,1913174,1913439,0,0,gojomo,,,"I was impressed with <i>Die Hard</i> (1988) when I first saw it; so well engineered, as a movie and story and visual spectacle. Now that's the way action movies should be made, I thought, and hoped there'd be more like it -- even while wary of formulaic recombinations, like 'Die Hard on a boat', etc.<p>Years later, I saw <i>The General</i> (1927), and it blew my mind. There, 60+ years earlier, was 'Die Hard on rails'. There were so many action-movie scenes and stunts and plot points that have been repeated over and over in the decades since.<p>But: when Keaton did it, he wasn't cribbing anyone else. These weren't old familiar cliches (yet). He was risking his health with dangerous stunts. He didn't have the help of later special effects. He didn't even have sound or spoken dialogue. But still it all worked: the humor, the story, the stunts, the tension.<p>It was like discovering the common ancestor of hundreds of  later movie and TV tropes, the very first action flick that crawled out of the oceans of text and imagination to walk on the dry land of motion pictures.<p>To have created that, with the limited tools of the era, prefiguring so much of what came later -- well, we can only hope to do something similar with the still-young digital and network media of our age.",1289987866

Just drop the name and pick something else - desihacker.in is available. you might even get some good press.)<p>But having a local technology discussion group might not be all that useless - let me explain.<p>There are other hi-tech communities in India, similar to HotHardware or Extremetech which are hugely popular in the community (e.g. <a href=""http://www.erodov.com/forums/gigabyte-ga-x58a-ud9-review-ln2-overclocking-results/33458-page5.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erodov.com/forums/gigabyte-ga-x58a-ud9-review-ln2...</a>). So this is not something that is of unproven relevance.<p>India has a chicken and egg problem in terms of programming intellectual prowess. The community is driven primarily by that which can lay down your daily supper - Java/JSP/VB/ASP . By virtue of the existing <i>tech leadership pool</i>, most innovation is driven from the west. And it takes a long time before the community takes root in India.<p><begin rant> I blame the community for it. For instance, it would make far greater sense for the Linux community to try and hold their top level conferences in India - which could very well be their biggest customer base (the west is lost to the fruit seller already). Did you know Dell, HP, Lenovo, etc. sell laptops with Ubuntu/Freedos preinstalled in India (off the shelf) ? </end rant><p>Point being, I think India does need a sunrise period for its technology community to be shepherded in. Hacker News is definitely too advanced in its expectation of the community for... say a fresh-behind-the-ears college student in India.<p>This community might also be too Yank in its vernacular. Yes, there are a lot of Indians around, but we are all comfortable with the vernacular, prefer it even. That is definitely, definitely not true for most Indians who might feel completely alienated (especially the younger ones)<p>For all the other Indians, torn between feelings of loyalty and betrayal, I encourage to search out and mentor the fledgling community back home - they need your help so that eventually they can come here and start flaming!",1289987604

I'm not defending the TSA. I'm arguing against a single, silly, unnecessary and counterproductive, argument against them. Arguing against an argument against something, does not make someone a proponent of that thing.<p><pre><code>  And you're just spewing out the FDA report\n</code></pre>\nFrom my study I have experience with medical applications involving these kinds of radiation. I know effects and dosages. Even if there are false comparisons, they are irrelevant: the numbers are the numbers and they are clear. Dosage: minimal. Even an additional factor 100 due to focusing on the skin is not noteworthy. The different energy might, but there are many reasons to believe it doesn't matter. Finally, the entire point is irrelevant. That it is thought the TSA needs these things in the first place, <i>that</i> is the problem. Focusing on this possibly associated problem does more damage to the general opinion about 'radiation', then it serves the cause of banning these machines.<p><pre><code>  (e.g. likening the kind of radiation one receives while\n  flying with X-ray radiation of the backscatter machines)\n</code></pre>\nSigh. Doctors also comfort patients by telling them the dosage of an X-ray photograph provides a similar dosage to flying to Australia. Yes, there are some caveats. Those caveats on that comparison do not debunk the FDA report. The general point of that comparison is valid. These doctors aren't lying to their patients about the risks involved.",1289987531

I'm not saying that's a small thing, but the OP could have achieved the same using parenscript.<p>The GP seemed to be implying that we should only generate our HTML programatically on the client. Thinking about it more, I don't agree with this. I don't write webapps these days, but in our platform we do a lot of code generation. We use a programmatic method to do this because we have to manipulate the intermediate representation a lot - add or remove fields added by earlier phases in the generation etc. This is much more flexible but it's much harder to maintain, and looking at the code generation code it's very hard to see what the end result will be. If we were simply generating code in a single pass I'd definitely use templating, it's just much simpler, easier to develop, and easier to see what the end result will be.<p>Add in the need with HTML to work with designers and I think templating will be with us for some time to come.",1289987346

Please be assured that I have no personal grudge against you; it’s not like I know you or anything.<p>Numerous tablets were made before the iPad. They were all completely unusable. They were all “designed” by people with your mindset.<p>If someone asked you to design the first sofa, you’d suggest bolting three kitchen chairs together and letting the client choose what type of bolt to use. The resulting “design” would be inevitably awful, because it isn’t designed at all – rather than examining the phase space of possible solutions, it examines what you happen to have lying around on the workbench.<p>Having no sense of design isn’t a great personal failing. I’m not much of a designer myself. Everyone’s bad at something – most things, in fact. Not realizing you don’t have it can be a problem, though.",1289984594

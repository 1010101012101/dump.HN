Why do you need the guns, if you don&#x27;t use them to defend your privacy?</i><p>Bear a few things in mind... most Americans don&#x27;t own a gun, and most who do don&#x27;t have them to rise up against the government, and quite a few don&#x27;t fit into the stereotype of &#x27;gun loving American&#x27; at all. After the Newtown shooting (I believe it was) there was widespread support for gun control legislation (close to 90% IIRC) but it was summarily killed because of the power of lobbyists.<p>America is bigger and more complicated than perhaps it seems from the outside. Also, gun ownership is a constitutional issue... IANACS* but the purpose of that is to allow the people to rise up against the tyranny of either an oppressive government or an outside enemy (as there was no assumption at the time that a standing national army would be a thing, or that Britain was going to leave us alone.)

5960695,comment,5960044,5960044,32,0,malandrew,,,"I posted the following comment in another thread[0], but it is even more relevant here:<p><pre><code>    The other thing that is so worrying about the US having 
    the communications of people around the world 
    indiscriminately is that it basically means that the NSA 
    is in a position to blackmail any citizen of any country 
    that enters into a position of power in that country.

    Forget installing a shah of Iran or propping some dictator 
    in a South American country. They can now do the same at 
    an arms length. Just collect dirt on all foreigners, wait 
    until they get into power, then use whatever dirt you 
    collected over many years to blackmail that person to do 
    things that are in the self interest of the people at the 
    NSA instead of the self interest of the people that duly 
    elected that representative.

    This whole situation is a legitimate threat to democracy 
    in this country, but Congress may try to put checks and 
    balances in place to slow the rate at which it erodes 
    democracy at home. However, of more immediate importance 
    is how this is a legitimate threat to democracy everywhere 
    outside the US.

    Many Americans may hear the NSA say things like &quot;We don&#x27;t 
    do anything illegal and coercive with this information at 
    home&quot; and may believe them. But do most Americans think it 
    is reasonable to coerce elected officials or other 
    countries using any information gathered by the NSA? 
    Should we not be asking the NSA if they actually do that?

    This is one of the questions I most want to see asked:

    &quot;General Keith B. Alexander, has the NSA ever wittingly 
    used collected information on any foreigner elected to 
    office by his or her citizens to coerce or blackmail that 
    duly elected official to pursue policies that may not be 
    in the interest of the citizens that elected them?&quot;
</code></pre>
IMHO any type of coercion or blackmail of any leader of any country is tantamout to an act of war against the citizens of that country. However these acts would often never be known by the citizens of those countries. Instead, if they are unhappy with coerced actions, they can only blame the politician being coerced instead of being able to blame the people pulling the strings.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5959271"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5959271</a>",1372459449

Therefore, regardless of how much a state or other jurisdiction changes, they could not change their status under this law. If they were originally on the preclearance list, never had another voting anomaly, elected minorities to every position in the state, and had 100% minority turnout, for decades on end, they would remain on the preclearance list, because of what happened 40 years ago.<p>That&#x27;s simply not true. You can seek exemption from section 5. It&#x27;s called &quot;bailing out&quot;. A county or state on the preclearance list that has not been discriminatory for 10 years (see [1] for criteria) may sue to be exempt from Section 5. Many counties have done this successfully; the state of New Hampshire successfully bailed out as recently as this March.<p>States or counties that were found to be discriminatory could also be &quot;bailed in.&quot; Arkansas and New Mexico, LA County in California, as well as several other counties were bailed in.<p>In other words, the Voting Rights Act was built with a mechanism to self-destruct when it was no longer necessary. Congress overwhelmingly approved an extension of the VRA in 2006 after extensive research and testimony. If a state or county was still covered in 2013, then it had a problem with discrimination within the past ten years, which is the minority thought the opinion that &quot;things have changed&quot; was foolish.<p><a href=""http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/misc/sec_4.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/misc/sec_4.php</a>",1372459066

He showed them both a shiny metal box with two slots in the top, a control knob and a lever.
&quot;What do you think this is?&quot;<p>One advisor, an engineer, answered first. &quot;It is a toaster,&quot; he said.<p>The king asked, &quot;How would you design an embedded computer for it?&quot;<p>The engineer replied, &quot;Using a four-bit microcontroller, I would write a simple program that reads the darkness knob and quantizes its position to one of 16 shades of darkness, from snow white to coal black. The program would use that darkness level as the index to a 16-element table of initial timer values. Then it would turn on the heating elements and start the timer with the initial value selected from the table. At the end of the time delay, it would turn off the heat and pop up the toast. Come back next week, and I&#x27;ll show you a working prototype.&quot;<p>The second advisor, a computer scientist, immediately recognized the danger of such short-sighted thinking. He said, &quot;Toasters don&#x27;t just turn bread into toast, they are also used to warm frozen waffles. What you see before you is really a breakfast food cooker. As the subjects of your kingdom become more sophisticated, they will demand more capabilities. They will need a breakfast food cooker that can also cook sausage, fry bacon, and make scrambled eggs. A toaster that only makes toast will soon be obsolete. If we don&#x27;t look to the future, we will have to completely redesign the toaster in just a few years.<p>With this in mind, we can formulate a more intelligent solution to the problem. First, create a class of breakfast foods. Specialize this class into subclasses: grains, pork and poultry. The specialization process should be repeated with grains divided into toast, muffins, pancakes and waffles; pork divided into sausage, links and bacon; and poultry divided into scrambled eggs, hard-boiled eggs, poached eggs, fried eggs, and various omelet classes.<p>The ham and cheese omelet class is worth special attention because it must inherit characteristics from the pork, dairy and poultry classes. Thus, we see that the problem cannot be properly solved without multiple inheritance. At run time, the program must create the proper object and send a message to the object that says, &#x27;Cook yourself&#x27;. The semantics of this message depend, of course, on the kind of object, so they have a different meaning to a piece of toast than to scrambled eggs.<p>Reviewing the process so far, we see that the analysis phase has revealed that the primary requirement is to cook any kind of breakfast food. In the design phase, we have discovered some derived requirements. Specifically, we need an object-oriented language with multiple inheritance. Of course, users don&#x27;t want the eggs to get cold while the bacon is frying, so concurrent processing is required, too.<p>We must not forget the user interface. The lever that lowers the food lacks versatility and the darkness knob is confusing. Users won&#x27;t buy the product unless it has a user-friendly, graphical interface.<p>When the breakfast cooker is plugged in, users should see a cowboy boot on the screen. Users click on it and the message &#x27;Booting UNIX v. 8.3&#x27; appears on the screen. (UNIX 8.3 should be out by the time the product gets to the market.) Users can pull down a menu and click on the foods they want to cook.<p>Having made the wise decision of specifying the software first in the design phase, all that remains is to pick an adequate hardware platform for the implementation phase. An Intel 80386 with 8MB of memory, a 30MB hard disk and a VGA monitor should be sufficient. If you select a multitasking, object oriented language that supports multiple inheritance and has a built-in GUI, writing the program will be a snap. (Imagine the difficulty we would have had if we had foolishly allowed a hardware-first design strategy to lock us into a four-bit microcontroller!).&quot;<p>The king had the computer scientist thrown in the moat, and they all lived happily ever after.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~elf/hack/ktoast.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~elf/hack/ktoast.html</a>",1372458500

Pushing the branch changer off to be so subtle hurts.  I change branches, a lot.  Browsing code and changing the branch is something I frequently do on GH.<p>2. Lack of clone url is annoying.  If all I have to do is click Clone and that&#x27;s it, then I can live with that.<p>3. Clown, Download, and Watch are too far down the screen. I usually have a big screen, but not always, and I have my monitors maximized.<p>4. The ordering of the links on the right are odd. I click Watch, Clone, and Download far more than Contributors.  Still, the ordering is off.  Pulse is at the top, but we start off with Code?  With very little thought, I&#x27;d order them Code, Commits, Pull Requests, Issues, Branches & Tags, etc.<p>5. The Wiki link is hidden.  It really should have a better place. While the rest of the links on the right relate directly to code at some level, the Wiki does not.  It&#x27;s documentation mostly.  Being disregarded like it is, it should be removed.  Either that, or found a better home.<p>6. Stars and Forks should be Star and Fork.  They are labels for buttons that perform an action, not state.<p>7. Code, I assume, takes up a lot more space! Yay!<p>8. The top is clean, making it easy to see exactly where I&#x27;m at.<p>These are just initial thoughts.  Overall, the design is more open.

I guess the point I was trying to make is that the delta wing as a top speed breaking EV is a much better body shape for straight run events.  If Drayson really wanted all out speed for the record, he would have designed a purpose built car and not just use a chassis he ran over here in ALMS.

Congress&#x27; decision to require preclearance was not declared unconstitutional on its own.  The problem was that the formula for deciding who required preclearance is a static rule that does not allow for the evaluation of any events after 1972.  Therefore, regardless of how much a state or other jurisdiction changes, they could not change their status under this law. If they were originally on the preclearance list, never had another voting anomaly, elected minorities to every position in the state, and had 100% minority turnout, for decades on end, they would remain on the preclearance list, because of what happened 40 years ago.<p>Chief Justice John Roberts even wrote in his opinion that congress is free to make new legislation that has the same consequences.  But it must rely on current data to evaluate jurisdictions.",1372457014

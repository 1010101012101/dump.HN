The amount of processor documentation you have to get through is mind boggling, after which you're still left with documentation for the plethora of peripheral device. I view this as a failure of the PC architecture. There's no reason for things to be so complex.<p>OTOH, I know a few folks who work with all kinds of micros. Once these folks were trying to interface a SD card reader with a tiny LCD screen that had an onboard processor. They had (<i>had to have</i>, in fact) low-level access to the card reader. You had to know the ins and outs of whatever filesystem the SD card was formatted with because you only had raw access to the card. As in, you could go to an address on the card and do something to the bytes stored there, and that's it. After diddling the card reader interface for a while, they eventually figured out how to get data on the card, but there was a problem: sometimes the card reader wouldn't write the data to the card at all. After trying to pinpoint and fix the issue in code, an entire night of hacking later, the problem turned out to be a faulty power adapter.<p>It was a fun night.

Otherwise to change the trajectory of Earth's center of gravity requires an external force of some sort. Some small effect from a different mass distribution will be caused and it will have to be taken into effect, but when you care about these effects as far as I know you have to measure them empirically anyhow, because if you care at that level of detail it turns out there's a lot of noise as the Earth warms and cools and has various flows within it and as water moves hither and yon and so on. So while it will have some effect it is merely one of very many such things.<p>Technically speaking, it won't require any recalibration either, because when the satellites tell you that you are 2.4 meters away from where you were yesterday when standing in the ""same location"", <i>they're right</i>. (Assuming this number is reliable.) GPS doesn't really tell you where you are ""on the surface"", they tell you where you are within the sphere they encompass and from there we map that back to the surface location with other knowledge our systems have.

It was used more for high-stakes marriage than for low-stakes marriage, which says something about the importance of dating to marriage.<p>On the other hand, dating is generally done over fairly long periods that allow you to gather quite a lot of information about the other person. That is similar to a job interview in no way.",1454032787

So I believe disability programs would benefit the most from some of the proposals in the article.<p>That said, they certainly wouldn&#x27;t have the same BI as everyone else, just as children wouldn&#x27;t and the elderly probably wouldn&#x27;t as well, since they have existing programs targeted to them. The idea is just to replace non-cash benefits within each group (those four are probably sufficient), and smooth out the payout curve and find the equivalent BI for that NIT.<p>CoL adjustments would result from this as well: the primary way this is currently done is via housing as you mention. Any housing assistance benefit can be valued like other programs, so that could then be disbursed as cash. In practice, this means layered basic incomes at the federal/state/local level, and if done gradually they could be designed to minimize evictions.<p>Those with addiction issues who would spend all their money tend to have mental illness, which hinders their ability to get benefits in the current system. I suggest retaining social workers for such circumstances:<p>> Some of these programs will likely be more effective than their cash value — especially those serving the physically disabled and mentally ill — and should remain intact.",1454031851

It&#x27;s not uncommon, why bother re-inventing the HTTP server wheel. At a previous company, a service I ran would have cost $3.6 million a year in nginx plus licensing fees. Almost none of the added &#x27;plus&#x27; features would have been at all useful.<p>If you see nginx plus as a way to pay for the core software then sure, maybe that cost is appropriate. I will not support them with per-server licensing of gated off features. Oh and by the way, nginx plus is closed source and is only available on a small handful of platforms, and doesn&#x27;t always maintain the same release schedule as the open source version, all as a way of supporting their licensing scheme.<p>I would support nginx via professional services and support fees, but only in conjunction with the open source release.

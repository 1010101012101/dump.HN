Usually the future generation. One can delay this, but it will catchup eventually. One manifestation is borrowing assets from an unrealizable future.<p>This is not to say local loops are externality free, but I conjecture they are more information-efficient and likely to get corrected quicker.",1393966787

7343011,comment,7342240,7342850,8,0,bane,,,"The first link you provided also brings up several interesting implications about continuous surveillance from space. The first is that it is <i>technically</i> possible, but economically difficult. Getting ~5000 high resolution satellites in LEO is not really all that much more difficult than getting 1, it&#x27;s a matter of scale. But getting funding to put that number up is virtually impossible. Even smallsats and other swarm approaches lack the physical space for the sensors (which is limited by physics, not technology). This is why air breathing drones are becoming so important. Make no mistake, NASA continuous aircraft programs like Helios have ready applications in surveillance. And from those heights, the sensors don&#x27;t have to be nearly as large as on an LEO bird.<p>The second is that receiving data from that many birds is problematic. There are only so many receiving stations and only so much EM bandwidth available for communication and recovery of the images. Even switching to drones doesn&#x27;t solve the problem. Even as of last year bandwidth was a limiting factor for the number of drones up in the air at once. [1] So now we have two problems, getting birds in the air, and we still have the bandwidth problem for downlink.<p>Finally, analyzing that much imagery is nearly impossible. Automated algorithms help some with certain tasks, but storage, processing, accessing, then analyzing all of that on a continuous basis is pretty much impossible. So even if getting enough sensors deployed is solved, and getting bandwidth is solved, it doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s enough people to physically look at and interpret the results anyway. And storing all that for later instantaneous on-demand retrieval is still a problem nobody&#x27;s really solved.<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.defensenews.com/article/20130331/DEFFEAT02/303310009/Pentagon-Seeks-Solutions-UAV-Bandwidth-Crunch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.defensenews.com/article/20130331/DEFFEAT02/303310...</a>",1393966138

The problem isn&#x27;t bad code, it&#x27;s lack of a backup plan- e.g. insurance and reinsurance.<p>Among bitcoin holders there seems to be a tendency to assume the technical sophistication of bitcoin mining and blockchains somehow perfects operations involving the buying and selling of bitcoin. The analogy I would draw is to notes which can be exchanged for gold and backed by a central government.<p>It can be the case that notes are reliably exchangeable for gold and also the case that a bank takes these notes for deposit without writing down the deposit in a ledger. Likewise the bank allows withdrawal of notes, again without writing them down. If An individual makes the decision to deposit notes with that bank based on the certainty the notes may be exchanged for gold, they have used the wrong set of facts as the basis of their decision.<p>At best the robustness of bitcoin is independent of the robustness of bitcoin businesses. My suspicion is that in practice their is a negative correlation because stolen bitcoin are largely unrecoverable and do not trade at a discount.",1393965786

I get that the peer-to-peer nature of it is considered a strong point by many -- but it also exposes users to fraud with little recourse.<p>It&#x27;s basically like carrying cash: you can walk around with $10,000 in your pocket, but if someone robs you and gets away, you&#x27;re out $10,000. If someone steals your credit card, the bank has fraud protection measures in place that limit their losses, and they often can roll back transactions. Unless you impose a similarly regulated structure on top of Bitcoin (where banks are super-secure and won&#x27;t transfer large amounts of BTC without an auditable authorization chain so people become personally liable for any fraud that may occur) you&#x27;re not going to be able to solve these problems.<p>Deflation is a bigger issue, in my mind. The algorithmic scaling of Bitcoin basically ensures that it will either not be very much in demand at all, or it will become increasingly scarce relative to demand over time. This creates an incentive to buy and hold Bitcoin as its value has tended to go up over time. However, most of the modern economy is based on the assumption that money today is worth slightly more than money tomorrow. This creates pressure to spend or invest, rather than hold onto currency for any reason other than liquidity. If Bitcoin remains popular, it won&#x27;t be because of its virtues as a currency.",1393965702

It&#x27;s much more readable than to nest conditional statements.<p><pre><code>  if (some_parameter > max_valid_value)\n    goto error;\n  if (some_function() <= )\n    goto error;\n  ...\n  ...\n  if (some_alloc() == NULL)\n    goto error;\n  ...\n  ...\n  ...\n  ...\n  error:\n    // cleanup what needs to be freed,...\n</code></pre>\nIt can also be quite useful to exit nested loops for example.

The fact that the government provides a service does not imply that the service would not exist if the government did not do it. We could absolutely have cabs without the TB problem without the government. In fact, in areas where the government does not enforce its own monopoly, you see competition with government-provided services flourishing. UPS, FedEX, and DHL versus USPS. Private college loan providers. Private universities. Private schools. On and on. The idea that without the government doing it, we are going to have rampant TB-infested taxi drivers is just silly. No one wants to use such a taxi and they do not need the government to tell them that.<p>> &quot;This is the big problem I have with the libertarian free market ideal: it&#x27;s fundamentally reactive, not proactive.&quot;<p>I do not know if I should take that statement seriously. I expect if you think over that statement for even 30 seconds you can see why it is both a complete non sequitur and insane.<p>1) Laws are obviously reactive. I would bet all the money in my pockets against all the money in your pockets that TB testing was put in effect as a reaction to an event in which a taxi, bus, or train driver was spreading TB.<p>2) The free market is exactly as reactive or proactive as people are. This is its virtue. People providing other people what they want is the whole point, both of markets and, it is claimed by those who believe in the State, the government. No organization, government or otherwise, can get away from being reactive to human needs unless it provides things people do not want or need, and in what way would so doing be good?<p>3) It does not matter anyway. The point of all this is that people should be free to pursue their desires, regardless of the considerations of people who think they know better and are worried about things being &quot;reactive&quot; or &quot;proactive&quot;. These concerns are simply petty against the moral position of freedom.<p>Look, I enjoy a good discussion on the internet as much as anyone. I have learned a lot from reading comments on HN.

Often as first hand feedback from the person with a family. Financial obligations are more. No doubt. When I started my first company I lived off of a few hundred dollars a month (personally) and put everything else into the company.<p>And your point about &quot;eating ramen&quot; is too true.<p>In my experience, founding a company in my 20&#x27;s, early 30&#x27;s and doing one again in my late 30&#x27;s is that finding a big opportunity is equally hard at any age. I don&#x27;t see that getting any easier. However, what I do differently now is that that I&#x27;m infinitely more disciplined. I talk to customers earlier, I spend less time on building a prototype (6 weeks to 12 weeks max), and am willing to kill an idea as soon as I realize that its not going to get me to my goal.<p>What I&#x27;d be interested in seeing are stats on the success of 30+ founders who are on a 2nd/3rd startup vs. 1st time founders who are 30+. My guess is these two groups would diverge widely, but that&#x27;s just a guess.<p>Importantly, I find some parts of starting a company much easier at this age.<p>First, and perhaps most importantly, my wife and I have committed to the startup lifestyle (not a lifestyle business per say, but to pursuing opportunities to grow our net worth). We openly discuss our goals. We have been together through 2 companies, so we know how much of a pain this one will be. We are in agreement that the costs of building a new company are worth the potential to take us to the next level financially. I find this is where many people think that starting a company after marriage is more difficult. However, I have seen that being married can lighten your load as a founder if you and your spouse agree on who will carry what load. One of my friend&#x27;s had the same conversation with his wife. She&#x27;s starting a company, and he&#x27;s pulling a huge load at home. So the same advice works for both men and women.<p>In terms of distractions, I have way less of them now than when I was younger. Everyone I know is busy with family and kids, so there is little pressure to hang out and waste time.<p>This is totally personal experience/opinion, but kids have been a boon to my startup work. There&#x27;s no way to explain it except to say that spending time with my daughters is calming. Stress be damned.<p>Maybe its just me, but I find the 20 year olds of today exceptionally capable. I am super impressed with how good the younger generations are. They are focused, motivated, capable. I find this beneficial both because I have now have experience, but there is an entire younger generation who are wonderful to speak with, learn from, and work with.<p>The financial aspects of starting a company now are a world easier. Without diving into detail, its a cake walk now. I don&#x27;t starve. I know to expect losses on some ideas. I&#x27;ve had enough failures and some successes to know that sometimes ideas and companies fail, and sometimes they succeed.<p>In summary, your point is well taken. It&#x27;s definitely different.",1393963961

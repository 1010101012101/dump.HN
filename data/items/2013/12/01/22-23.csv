6829853,comment,6828721,6829486,3,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Yes it requires technology to collect the tolls. We have that down to a pretty efficient science these days thanks to cameras. They don&#x27;t even slow down traffic to collect tolls.<p>The technology costs money, it creates bureaucracy, and it wastes time. You get an EZ-Pass, you now have more charges to reconcile on your credit card which wastes time (multiply by XX million people this turns out to be a lot of wasted time), some people have to be hired to work in a call center to answer calls, maintain webservers, repair road sensors, do enforcement against people who don&#x27;t pay, etc. etc. Then it&#x27;s the government, so they&#x27;re going to get some private company to do it, which is going to hire a bunch of lobbyists (more wasted resources), which are then going to lobby hard to keep as much of the collected money in their own pockets as bureaucratically possible.<p>Also, the automated systems make the surveillance problem worse by an order of magnitude or more.<p>> I&#x27;ve never encountered a toll road that wasn&#x27;t a major expressway. The coffee house argument is non-sensical.<p>How is it that someone can&#x27;t work near an onramp to a major expressway and the nearest coffee house be at the next exit or just across a toll bridge?<p>To get to the point, are you questioning the premise that increasing the price of something can discourage productive uses of that thing?<p>> Toll roads have a very attractive benefit to me. I don&#x27;t drive.<p>Do you also grow everything you eat in your back yard, never buy anything in a local store or have it delivered by UPS and will never require any emergency vehicles to come to your home or work for any reason?",1385938794

In the case of Bitcoin, the price can only grow if legitimate transactions increase, or if more people speculate. With every increase in price the number of people willing to speculate decreases, to the point where you run out of greater fools to sell the asset onto, causing a crash.<p>That means that an increase in legitimate transactions is really the only way to sustainably grow the value of the network, because it is the only method resistant to falls in price.",1385938589

There, we learn about principles/paradigms such as MPI, threading, CUDA to address these issues. I took another course that was basically only Hadoop. Both are good. It completely depends on what the outcome of your course is: If you are looking for someone who just needs a flavor of what it means to think at that scale, generating an EC2 cluster and working on a few Map Reduce problems should be fine.

One class of those disputes is the government vs citizens who have violated the government&#x27;s rules or the laws.<p>When those kinds of cases are going through the courts the government should be extra careful to be impartial because everyone can tell that it&#x27;s potentially a situation ripe for corruption.  The government is adjudicating a case between the government (the DA or prosecutor) and someone not in the government (&quot;normal people&quot;).<p>Given the choice you wouldn&#x27;t choose your wife&#x27;s parents to settle a dispute between you and your wife; but this can be a very real fear when being prosecuted.<p>The problem here is even though you can name the different parts of the government and call them separate (courts, prosecutor, forensics, etc) ultimately we find out that forensics and the prosecutor are both &quot;on the same team&quot; and that when the courts get involved again to try and fix the mess, that the forensics person is still &quot;on the same team&quot; as the prosecutors and maybe everyone else.<p>If you&#x27;re in the class of people called &quot;the government&quot; you have to be extra right, extra careful, and extra following-the-rules so that ordinary people get a fair shake when dealing with an entity that has virtually limitless funds to prosecute versus their usually meager funds to defend (unless you&#x27;re in the top 1% to 0.1% or so, then it&#x27;s just &quot;lots more&quot; rather than &quot;infinitely more&quot;).<p>Here&#x27;s a case where not only was the forensics person not extra careful, right and proper, not even sloppy and foolish but malicious.  And not just a little bit either, she didn&#x27;t tamper with one case that involved a cheating ex or something.  She did it systematically over thousands of cases depriving people of their liberty wrongly.  You could build a strong case that she perverted justice in a very horrific manner.<p>If you add up all the person-years of people&#x27;s lives that she conspired to help imprison and divide by 100 year in a life (round numbers) you&#x27;d get to the point where she&#x27;s effectively &quot;taken&quot; tens if not hundreds of lives.  That makes her in a roundabout way something akin to a very impressive mass murderer.  In that case I&#x27;m not sure that the death penalty is an over-reactionary knee-jerk kind of punishment.",1385937192

The reason the government has to do it at all is that the benefits are so diffuse within the population that private collective action is incapable of overcoming the transaction costs.<p>In order for the government to fairly collect based on the utility of the roads, they would have to go out and pay all the transaction costs to determine the correct amounts -- how much should someone without a car be paying for the roads for the benefit of allowing mail and packages to be delivered, or of having goods they can buy delivered to local stores, or of having a timely emergency response? Shouldn&#x27;t people more likely to need an ambulance be paying more for roads ambulances can use? Shouldn&#x27;t trucks that deliver necessities be paying a higher toll since the recipients clearly benefit from them more than trucks delivering frivolous things? How do we determine what proportion of the value of some delivery of goods or other use of the road is attributable to the existence of the road, and what do we use as a reference to calculate the alternative in each case?<p>Apportioning the value of the roads to the people who find them useful is utterly hopeless. And if you&#x27;re not going to do it right, and doing it wrong causes both unfairness and economic inefficiency, you ought not to do it at all and just fund it through general taxation.",1385937111

Just stick it in the basement, stack on top of the fileserver, whatever.  If you&#x27;re doing the dorm room thing or living aboard a sailboat you have to realize that involves some highly unusual lifestyle compromises.  For most people its not an issue.<p>Noise:  I did splurge on some large slow fans (like $10) to replace old small fast (LOUD) fans.

I don&#x27;t find my desktop at home or work to be particularly loud.  I did at one time run a more modern desktop as a firewall and specifically ripped out the fancy graphic card and used the on board video, to reduce noise a little.  After installation I never used the video or keyboard again, all SSH access, so its not like it needed fancy graphics.  My main firewall/wifi/dhcp/asterisk/stuff/etc box is about 50 walking feet from my sleeping head, past the (sometimes) loud fridge, the dishwasher, the clothes dryer, the hot water heater...  For most people its not going to be an issue.<p>Power consumption.  Not an issue.  I was drawing about 50 watts which will cost about $50 or about 3 weeks of cablemodem service per year.

Here’s why:<p>We’re building our own network.  We need fine-grained control over latency and geographic distribution.  We’ll be running our own AS (62862), peering at major exchanges, and purchasing transit from high-quality providers.<p>We’re running our own hardware.  This goes to latency again: by owning our own routers, by being particular about what switches run behind them, and by provisioning memory and persistent storage specific to our application, we can deliver a better experience to our customers.  We can also deliver at lower cost.<p>We’re designing our software for high availability.  Losing a datacenter will not impact the availability of our service.<p>We’re building our mobile SDKs to provide a complete solution: offline message buffering, cross-device handling of push notifications, cross-device message sync, respectful battery consumption, and in front of it all, a simple api.<p>We care about documentation: <a href=\"https://layer.com/docs/ios\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://layer.com/docs/ios</a>.  Our docs are the first experience developers will have with Layer.<p>We care about design.  We won’t be releasing our own apps - that’s up to our customers - but we’ll be open sourcing beautiful example apps that build on our SDKs.<p>We care about security and privacy.  Securing the transport is only the first step.  When we don’t have the keys we can’t access the data.  (In theory.  Security is hard.)<p>Today we&#x27;re a team of engineers and designers passionate about communications. We’re on a mission to make communications better through every product -- mobile or web -- that people use and love.  We hold the power to dramatically improve the way 2 billion+ Internet users communicate.<p>We’re well funded and have already assembled an early team that shows we mean business.

6829610,comment,6825196,6829481,1,0,monsterix,,,"Absolutely! Is there a research or report on what percentage of poor have quit villages and moved to sub-urban areas lately?<p>Last when I was working near a village in central India near Uttar Pradesh/Madhya Pradesh border the estimate was a little under 4% (which is huge given the absolute numbers). I kind of believe that over 90% bulk might still be within the rural consideration, but I could be wrong. The electorate interest and its outcome seems to indicate that bulk of rural India is still where it was.<p>About 15 years ago, rural migration from the state of Orissa and Uttar Pradesh was pegged at less than 1%. So it is not out of context to consider here that the average speed of travel within the country and connectivity by rail and road has improved by factor of 4 in the last 15 years.<p>This is the rural progress and implementation of ordinary technology, that we easily miss out on, that has brought about rural migration that we&#x27;re talking about here. It has <i>sparked ambition</i> in the poor which now aspires for a better life in the suburban cachement of Indian cities.<p>Leads to concluding that it is the gap between the rich and poor that leads to criticism and praise of space programs like Mangalyan. The &#x27;100 million India&#x27; who have the gift of being in the elite 100 million should take a note of this gap. And not be perturbed by criticism of technical feats like the Mangalyan.<p>The benefit of ISRO space program (though it has strategic pitfalls too) would surely reach the balance 900 million poor eventually, but that is in future. Immediate priority  should be (and thankfully is) rural tech because that keeps the gap between rich and poor in control, and prevents volatility and conflict by keeping the sense of belongingness among the desperate poor.<p>That&#x27;s what I think, but I may be removed from reality given that I am off coast now.",1385935605

Yeah, the value is fairly unstable currently, largely because the current valuation is being driven almost entirely by speculation, however that is set to change. There&#x27;s already a lot of interest being shown by various retailers in accepting bitcoin as a form of payment. Currently as an actual currency you can use to buy stuff (as opposed to a commodity being traded) it&#x27;s fairly rare, but as it becomes increasingly common you should see the price fluctuations start to damp down as more and more real world goods starting having their values tied to the value of the currency.<p>I&#x27;m definitely shocked by the rapid climb in price we&#x27;ve seen recently. It&#x27;s unclear if this is a short term bubble driven by rampant speculation and renewed media interest, or if this represents the new &quot;normal&quot; and with the new interest the currency was effectively massively under-valued before now. It&#x27;s even possible that if there&#x27;s significant interest shown by some major players (say if for instance amazon and facebook signed on to allow payments/money transfers via bitcoin) we might see yet another massive upward valuation of the currency.",1385935574

Electronic billing aims to make the situation better.<p>Effective October 18, 2012, all claims administrators (insurance companies, self-insured employers, et al) for California workers compensation claims are required to be able to receive bills electronically.<p>DaisyBill is the facilitator for practices to take advantage of this new law, allowing them to enter in the information about services rendered, seeing both what they should charge for the services and what they should expect to be paid (as these are not always the same). DaisyBill manages the entire billing process, both sending the bill electronically and managing the responses about the status of the bill, including when it was paid and how much. As a result of using DaisyBill, practices are paid more quickly and accurately than when they submit bills via paper/snail mail. We&#x27;re talking 15 days instead of 60, 90, or more. This makes practices more likely to take on injured workers as patients, an obvious benefit for all parties.<p>--<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone to help us with a new product/revenue stream we&#x27;re going to be developing shortly. This product is a new fee calculator as the current one is expiring after the new year. We&#x27;re also going to be integrating with third party billers that are currently unable to submit workers comp bills electronically. There is no shortage of work to be done and there is a lot of money to be made.<p>I&#x27;m Kris, the CTO and sole developer at DaisyBill. Previously I was at ThoughtWorks, then Pivotal Labs. I decided to get out of consulting and into a product company because I wanted to own the product I was working on. DaisyBill is the only company out of many I considered that has a solid business plan with an intent to make a lot of money and do some good in the process.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a senior developer that is experienced with Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript. The stack we currently run is Rails 3.2/PostgreSQL 9.2 on Heroku. I&#x27;d like to rewrite the site using AngularJS at some point in the near future, so Angular experience is a plus. We also don&#x27;t have a designer, so having an eye towards good UX/UI is also a plus. We use Git and I&#x27;d expect any new hire to either already know Git quite well or be unafraid of it and be able to be brought up to speed quickly. I currently develop on an iMac with MacVim, and most people in the office use a standing desk.<p>You would be pairing reasonably regularly for the first few weeks but be expected to work independently not long after joining, asking questions as necessary. We also do a loose form of TDD: I typically like to sketch out an idea before trying to bake it in with tests. I also don&#x27;t test every line of code. I believe in being pragmatic about testing. We use RSpec and Jasmine.<p>I do interviews similarly to the way they&#x27;re done at Pivotal: After chatting about what you&#x27;re looking for in a position I&#x27;d have you come in and pair on some code. I care a lot about the interview process allowing the candidate to suss out whether the work environment and the actual work is what they&#x27;re interested in. I don&#x27;t do conference room whiteboard programming.<p>I don&#x27;t have a degree, and I don&#x27;t expect you to have one, either. I don&#x27;t necessarily care about how long you&#x27;ve been a developer, either. I care about the quality of your code today and your approach to solving problems. If you&#x27;re capable and can show it, I&#x27;m interested.<p>You may reach me at khicks@daisybill.com.<p>Cheers.",1385935552

In fact, the energy spent mining is the exact thing that makes the Bitcoin network function. The energy is being converted into trust. The more energy that is spent on mining, the more difficult it will be for a well-capitalized entity to perform an attack on the network.<p>Aaron Greenspan, repeat after me: Mining energy is not wasted. Mining energy is not wasted. Mining energy is not wasted.<p>Now, it <i>is</i> an open question as to whether the cost of running the Bitcoin network is worthwhile. However, for the moment, it clearly is. The fact that some miners can turn even a small profit on the Bitcoins they&#x27;re rewarded with demonstrates that the utility they provide has positive market value.<p>Of course at some point it may be that it costs substantially more to mine new Bitcoins than they are worth on the market. If this happens soon, Bitcoin will likely fail. If it happens later, it&#x27;s possible that transaction fees could prop up the network, but that&#x27;s purely speculative.<p>Another thing to consider when assessing the energy efficiency of the Bitcoin network is how it compares to the efficiency of existing currencies. Cash has a physical component and must be manufactured. Electronic fiat is backed by huge, complex, and expensive networks. Visa&#x27;s datacenters are not free. Keep in mind that credit card transactions typically have a transaction cost of 3%, which in some way represents the cost of operating the Visa network. 3% is kind of a staggeringly huge number, and off the cuff I expect that&#x27;s actually quite a bit higher than the total Bitcoin network cost to volume ratio...",1385935377

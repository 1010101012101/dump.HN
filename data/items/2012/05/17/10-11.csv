They do not want to block these sites permanently because then they lose an edge in the competition with airtel.<p>On the other hand whenever a movie from Reliance entertainment comes out they want to avoid the cams to spread for the first few weeks so they block these sites. Once the first couple of weeks have passed they undo the blocks.",1337252397

Test scores are a poor proxy for what students actually know or can do, especially in mathematics.  The original linked article provides evidence for that.  You put in the caveat <i>""Of course ... this won't work for all districts""</i> but then you're arguing for exceptions to be allowed.  That's just a mess.<p>There is no simple fix.  There are bad teachers (and I'm leaving the term undefined - it's a bit like porn - undefinable, but recognisable) who get good test results and glowing evaluations, and there are superb teachers who get mediocre test results and undistinguished evaluations.<p>It's easy from the outside or from a limited perspective to suggest ""obvious"" methods of assessment or ""obvious"" actions to improve the situation, but in the end, no one has really defined what they mean by ""good teaching,"" so proposing assessments of something undefined will just result in more proxies to be distorted.",1337252063

I took a job that wasn't ideal over another job offer.  The decision came down to the fact that it was in a location (and other personal factors) that all fell in my ""comfort zone"".  The job that I didn't take would have been a much better cultural fit and more in line with my long term goals.   I just didnt have the foresight to see this at that point.<p>I underestimated the negative effect of taking a job that had a tech stack I wasn't passionate about, would have on me personally and professionally.  I did learn a lot of valuable lessons from the job I took and by no means was it a write off.  I ended up staying there a few years but cant help wonder how things would be different if I had taken the other job.<p>You have the right attitude in not wanting to get an unrelated corporate job just for the sake of having a job.  So my advice would be to keep looking and if you need work desperately then settling for a temporary job outside of tech(or in) while you continue your search is better than getting tied into the corporate job you dont want to be doing.

But even then the argument is wrong.<p>It seems to me that what this comes down to is: is it justifiable and appropriate to categorise a person according to their behaviour (including the holding of opinions)? The author doesn't seem to deny that people can exhibit stupid <i>behaviour</i>, but argues that its wrong to categorise a person who exhibits such behaviour because you will (inevitably) never have enough information about the person or situation to make a judgement about the intrinsic qualities of the person. This might be true in some theoretical sense, but it doesn't really sit well with human nature or needs. We all have finite lives and stuff to be done in those lives. Making judgments about people is necessary to avoid a frustrating life spent (as in 'used up') dealing with people who behave stupidly.<p>And really, how long do you have to evaluate someone's behaviour before you are no longer 'jumping to conclusions' about them? Strangely, the author doesn't say. At some point you have use the history of a person's behaviour to decide[1]. A purist might say that such a decision should always be tentative, but in reality I think they soon become fixed. We are talking about people here.<p>For what its worth, my approach is that if I decide to think of someone as being stupid (or smart) then I try to be conscious and mindful of the decision, allow myself the opportunity to change my mind (while recognising that I probably won't), and always respect their dignity as a person.<p>[1] I suspect that how soon this happens will mainly depend on the social relationship between the people involved.",1337250255

At the very least, the post it replies to is at least, usually, on topic (Topicality is, of course, not the sole contributing factor to whether a comment is worthwhile).<p>I'm not ignoring that fact - it's just that I haven't accepted it. I agree that TIR posts do not derive value from adding valuable on-topic content. But I've suggested a way for them to derive value from another source. Given that, I don't accept the claim that they are just as bad as the posts they reply to. I thought (and still do) that the argument you were offering takes that as a premise. That's the point I made in the last comment, and I took it to be sufficient to show why your argument doesn't go through. I'm very much happy to be corrected if that's not the argument you had in mind.<p>The point about using existing tools/protocols is a different argument, and I think a good one. However, it doesn't bear on whether TIR posts are in themselves valuable or not - it only bears on the comparative value they have. Evaluation of that argument would require more knowledge than I have of the efficacy of different ways online communities enforce norms. Re the other points - I think there are interesting things to say about them, but I suspect that would take us off the central disagreement. I am however familiar with the other points about comment policy and downvotes etc... - I've used HN far longer than I've had this account. Whilst we're on issues of civility, I would say that suggesting comments come off as trolling, claiming people 'don't grasp' (which can mean 'don't understand'), and judging them on two sentence profiles dont seem to me very useful. I was slightly brusque in claiming your comment was 'beside the point' - but did so to echo your comment.<p>I think I should point out that I don't commit to the claim that TIR posts actually <i>are</i> valuable - I just think it's plausible that they are.",1337249084

Of course you&#x27;re willing to splurge on a vacation. However, with the prevalence of AirBnB, permanent residents are now competing with vacationers and it appears to be contributing to the increase of rents unilaterally.<p>Of course, you can respond that that is the free market at work; however I&#x27;d reply that the free market doesn&#x27;t always work out, and seeking a local maximum in daily rental prices is not in the long term best interests of the city. There are plenty of examples of cities which stopped being inhabitable when transformed into primarily tourist destinations, and that&#x27;s not a plight I&#x27;d like to see for New York.<p>Basically, long term airbnb rentals are artificially inexpensive because of the negative externalities at play. I&#x27;ve lived in the same apartment building as airbnb rentals and it sucks; someone crashing for a weekend does not feel the same responsibility towards their neighbors as a full time tenant. The costs of these temporary dwellings are spread among uncompensated neighbors.<p>In agreement with the article, I agree that it&#x27;s reasonable for someone to recoup some extra money when they go on vacation, and that&#x27;s totally in spirit with the brand of AirBnB; the problem to me is when they become corporate ventures where someone is renting out an apartment full time, and not living there.

If I showed up at the Frieze Gallery trying to sell them a piece of shit on a plate, they&#x27;d laugh in my face. If I produced documentation proving that the plate had in fact been shat upon by Andy Warhol, it would suddenly be Art and worth a fortune. If I revealed that I had faked the documentation, it would suddenly be worthless again--unless the whole routine had attracted enough attention for the art world to crown me a Designated Artist, in which case anything I smeared shit on henceforth would become, by fiat, Art.<p>There is literally no quality intrinsic to the work itself that contributes to its status as Art.

This is our strawman: if you reject &quot;climate change,&quot; you must be a crank. In addition, much debate centers on (b)—if climate change is &quot;our fault,&quot; it should be up to us to fix it. But (b) is irrelevant except insofar as it affects our options if the answer to (c) turns out to be &quot;We are facing a global catastrophe.&quot; If astronomers discovered an asteroid on collision course with Earth, no one would be persuaded to inaction by the argument that &quot;the asteroid isn&#x27;t our fault.&quot;<p>If you examine the political incentives producing the answers to (c), it&#x27;s obvious that in the current climate (heh) negative consequences are favored over positive ones. In other words, an ambitious young climate scientist seeking to maximize her chances of tenure would be foolhardy to undertake a detailed investigation of the likely benefits of global warming.<p>What we&#x27;re seeing in climate science is, I think, a close parallel of what happened in Russian biology under the Soviets—specifically, the work of Stalin&#x27;s favorite biologist, Trofim Lysenko. Lysenko developed a theory of the heritability of acquired characteristics (complete with fabricated laboratory experiments), which had obvious adaptive value in a régime seeking to develop, via social engineering, the &quot;new Soviet man.&quot; Similarly, predicting global catastrophe is adaptive in a régime where government-funded science must be solving Important Problems™, and where most members of the permanent government believe the majority of proposed anti–global warming measures (alternative energy, conservation, carbon taxes, etc.) are good ideas anyway.<p>So, do we really face global catastrophe as the result of climate change (human-induced or otherwise)? In an environment of Lysenkoist climate science, it&#x27;s hard to say for sure. But you&#x27;ll notice that the heritability of acquired characteristics didn&#x27;t exactly pan out. And given that most climate simulations are currently &quot;off model&quot; [1]—i.e., their predictions don&#x27;t match reality—we can reasonably guess the safe way to bet.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=5747"" rel=""nofollow"">http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=5747</a>",1440121689

The challenge is surfacing and distributing great content, and this is where Twitter should focus: maximizing reach and curating content.<p>Instead of forcing users to come to Twitter, Twitter should go wherever users are. Bring Twitter’s amazing content to them, wherever users are, through partners and syndication. Get people hooked as consumers before worrying about conversions. The upside is much cheaper user acquisition by piggybacking on media habits rather than breaking them. The downside is less revenue and possibly less loyalty, at least in the near term.<p>Media distributors like HuffPo and Yahoo boast massive audiences but need interesting content. Twitter can supply the content while Yahoo and others provide the users and sell ads. Both sides share revenue.<p>Outsourcing user acquisition to Yahoo and distributors doesn’t endanger Twitter. Twitter and only Twitter can produce this content, and since the content is unique, there is no risk of Yahoo swapping out Twitter for another company.<p>Put another way, syndication only strengthens Twitter as a product. Syndication expands the audience for tweets and deepens the incentive to publish via Twitter, which in turn generates more content and attracts more users, which in turn attracts more publishers. Syndication feeds a virtuous cycle.<p>The second piece, curating content, requires doing more to help individuals find and consume interesting tweets, and helping partners find and present interesting tweets. There is lots more Twitter could do, both with man and machine, in this area.<p>Maybe Twitter&#x27;s greatest sin is not being Facebook, but it shouldn&#x27;t be. There is enormous potential in helping people connect with others and enjoy content based on interests (Hi Reddit), not friendships. Many people, especially those on Wall Street and in the media, need a foil for Facebook, but hopefully the next CEO is not among them.<p>Twitter is a special company with special potential.",1440121360

ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
    ....
    D. Class and Consolidated Claims Waiver

    It is agreed that neither party shall have the right
    to participate as a class representative or class
    member with respect to any Disputes subject to
    arbitration under this Agreement or any Dispute
    between the parties. The parties also waive any
    right to assert consolidated claims with respect to
    any Disputes subject to arbitration under this
    Agreement or any Dispute between the parties.
</code></pre>
Such clauses are generally enforceable in the United States, as far as I can tell from a bit of Googling. It looks like in Canada, enforceability depends on whether the alleged misdeeds of the defendant arise from a violation of common law or a violation of specific consumer protection acts.<p>The &quot;Disputes subject to arbitration under this Agreement&quot; seem to be set out in 19.A, which is titled &quot;Scope&quot;, and the TL;DR of that section would be &quot;everything, except Ashley Madison can use the courts instead of arbitration if they wish to sue you over intellectual properties, confidential information, or illegal activity&quot;.<p>They do have one exception, given in 19.C, titled &quot;Small Claims&quot;, which says:<p><pre><code>    Both parties retain the right to file any claim that
    is not aggregated with the claim of any other
    persons and whose amount in controversy is properly
    within the jurisdiction of a court which is limited
    to adjudicated small claims.</code></pre>",1440119877

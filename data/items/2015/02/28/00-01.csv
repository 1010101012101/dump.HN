So she has a database like this:<p><pre><code>    d:`f`u!((&quot;adap.tv&quot;;&quot;adap.tv&quot;;&quot;btrll.com&quot;;&quot;btrll.com&quot;;&quot;cbs.com&quot;;&quot;cbsinter…\n    l:?d`f\n</code></pre>\nand in about thirty minutes of puzzling came up with this:<p><pre><code>    |/#:&#x27;y ss/:l[&~|/d.f[&x=d.u]~/:\:l]\n</code></pre>\nSince you don&#x27;t know K I&#x27;ll walk you through it:<p><pre><code>    d.f[&x=d.u]~/:\:l\n</code></pre>\nThis returns a list of bitmaps, such as:<p><pre><code>    (10000000000000000b;00000100000000000b)\n</code></pre>\nWhat it&#x27;s doing is taking all of the urls and indexing it by the where (&) address of each x (parameter to function: user id) is equal to the array of all of the users. That is, x=d.u returned: 01000001000000000000000000b and &x=d.u returned 1 7 (because the second and eighth element of that bitmap are ones). d.f[1 7] returns the second and eighth fragment.<p>Then, she &~|/ which ors- the bitmaps (|/) together, finds their complement (~), and takes the where of (&) them, so in this case 0 5. l[0 5] then returns the strings in the master list.<p>Note this is the list of all of the url fragments owned by <i>other users</i>:<p><pre><code>    l[&~|/d.f[&x=d.u]~/:\:l]\n</code></pre>\nIn PHP you might try to write:<p><pre><code>    $mine = array();\n    $theirs = array();\n    foreach($db as $row) {\n      if($row->u === $x) $mine[$row->f]=0;\n      else $thiers[$row->f]=0;\n    }\n    $list = array_diff(array_keys($thiers),array_keys($mine));\n</code></pre>\nbut there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of syntax here, and a number of PHP function calls that a beginner might not be aware of. She&#x27;s just using this:<p><pre><code>    http://www.timestored.com/kdb-guides/files/kdb-cheat-sheet.pdf\n</code></pre>\nSo then on to y ss/: which basically does a `strpos()` of each of our urls against the list we&#x27;re scanning (i.e. the thing that looks like &quot;<a href=""http://url,http://otherurl&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://url,http://otherurl&quot;</a>. She then counts each (#:&#x27;) result, takes the max again (|/). This means if ANY of those match, return `1b` otherwise return `0b`.",1425084814

The kinds of tree- and graph-like data structures that garbage collected languages can represent in safe code (at the cost of performance) don&#x27;t work as well in Rust; you can still implement them with various mechanisms (std::swap is very important for trees; Rc and Weak; replacing pointers with indices into a global Vec; etc.), but due to a desire to get optimal low-level performance, core data structures often end up using unsafe blocks in their implementations.  The thing is, though, implementing data structures is something of a worst case: in most other code you can <i>use</i> the data structures to provide the pointer relationships you need, but when implementing them you have to do that yourself.  Most other code is more naturally amenable to working with the borrow checker - which is not to say it&#x27;s not difficult.",1425084377

All of the major browsers offer extension frameworks (see these links for Firefox, Chrome, IE, Safari, and Opera).&quot;</i><p>It&#x27;s funny because the whole intercept thing is an escalation between ad networks and browser writers.<p>Basically if you can simulate a search engine, and get someone to put ads on those pages, you can make a bit of money. Back in the day it was all about creating a toolbar that had some features, and oh by the way changed your default search engine. Didn&#x27;t matter whether those results came from Google, Bing, Blekko, or more recently Yandex. The money was made when the person clicked an ad. (and yes the search provider got some form of remuneration, either for returning the results or as a share of the advertising revenue (or both in some cases).<p>But given the abuse of the extension eco-system all of the browsers now have really strong protections against switching your search choice, and if you don&#x27;t do that the toolbar is pretty worthless. So to continue in their business of providing ads when they were not wanted, the folks in &quot;Download Valley&quot;[1] switched to trying to get between you and your search engine of choice and then &quot;helping&quot; it with a few more ads.<p>[1] Hat tip to Matt Cutts who clued me into that particular name for the cluster of folks who build all this adWare.",1425084107

We don&#x27;t understand how it works remotely well enough to have a useful whole-brain model of its function (which means a lot of drug research is a primitive try-it-and-see-what-happens method, rather than the result of a detailed functional model of what SHOULD happen).  We don&#x27;t understand most of its more subtle pathologies (like depression) well enough to even properly evaluate treatments.  Most treatments we do have for such things are of limited and short-term efficacy, and we don&#x27;t even understand why they work.

While I don&#x27;t remember much about how I thought at the time I might have benefited from such a tutorial myself, when these days I mess around with exploits and the like which do weird things to memory, it often feels surprisingly grounding and illuminating to open up a debugger and start printing the contents of memory, even if on a theoretical basis I already know what it&#x27;s supposed to look like.<p>But please make it clear that the tables don&#x27;t accurately describe the real layout of memory in a compiled Rust program.  Heap mappings and thread stacks are typically at random (thanks to ASLR) addresses, rather than the start and end of memory, and the locations of specific heap allocations are usually based on complicated rules depending on the size class of the allocation (differently sized objects never get allocated together in most allocators), thread caches, ordering of buckets within a page, etc.  (Some architectures also grow the stack the other way.)",1425083478

It seems to me that Git/Mercurial just became the best centralized systems; being distributed fixed some critical faults with being centralized, and didn&#x27;t <i>really</i> introduce that much more complexity, IMO.  In most use-cases, you&#x27;re talking about one extra porcelain command in comparison to a server-connected client like SVN or TFS, assuming you push every single changeset.<p>I also think being distributed encourages small chunks of work, where being centralized encourages the batcave approach, and that, I think, is a much bigger differentiator than most people realize.  It impacts everything.  Suddenly, merging doesn&#x27;t seem as bad, and then suddenly being able to easily and cheaply create branches is more important.  Centralized systems never really got there because the client/server nature works against them.  I&#x27;m glad to see some big players giving them attention again, because one of the author&#x27;s best points is that being centralized has certain advantages.  It&#x27;s just that the existing centralized systems suck.<p>I also think the GitHub workflow comparison to the email list + patch days is a bit contrived because the email list procedure was never that simple (well, for getting ignored maybe it was, but the point was to contribute, not be ignored).  I, too, remember those days.<p>Steps 1&2 under GitHub aren&#x27;t really harder than step 1 under CVS (or what have you).

From those basic principles things you can start reasoning a lot about what Rust must do.<p>But I agree it does feel a bit weird to need to explain pointers while also assuming people understand memory layouts. There should probably be a quick guide to memory usage, maybe even using C, and from there introduce Rust&#x27;s concepts on top. It&#x27;s certainly a hard problem to introduce a high-level, functional, language that also has very powerful low-level concepts.<p>Thanks so much Steve for doing this work. Reading the guide made it all click into focus for me when I started, and the rest is _mostly_ syntax.",1425082170

In the beginning, it may actually be more important.<p>One of the most fascinating things about the recent explosion of the Magic service, was how Hacker News (and Product Hunt) essentially acted as a growth hack for a product that was developed in a weekend. Given that the people behind Magic were in the YC batch and probably had access to strong upvoting on Hacker News, that seems like a really good example of a growth hack (where the product is the marketing).",1425082041

In the same way as a project manager may decide 'we are going to use Python, C++, running on a xyz backend' or some such, the treatment needs to be based in MEDICINE. not that nutritionists, physiotherapists or speech pathologists don't have a word in - they are part of the <i>multidisciplinary team</i> that is part of the medical treatment team, but a decision needs to be made that you are practicing <i>MEDICINE</i> to treat this patient, not <i>pseudomedicine</i>. Using Pseudomedicine would be like having a coder for your IT project that only knows pseudocode.<p>From 'the cure' website:<p><i>The dietary strategies, the changes in lifestyle, the homeopatic oncology, the traditional chinese medicine and the many energies which you all have given me have all had the best of results.</i><p>Anyone with a half rational brain should be alarmed by this statement.<p>It is not that lifestyle changes are bad; they are good - they help a patient adapt to their new situation. But Traditional Chinese Medicine and Homeopathic Oncology are not treatments; they operate under fraudulent principles - they are, at best, Lifestyle interventions that claim to operate by exerting theraputic effects.<p>And so, the democratisation of medicine, which is empowering for patients, and a good thing, creates distortions in the marketplace, as the uninformed but impressionable patients make treatment decisions based on emotional appeals about <i>'holistic therapies'</i> that are <i>less toxic</i> - but also, and what is swept under the carpet, <i>less effective</i>.<p>Disclosure: Final year medical student",1353891504

At first glance, I thought this was some sort of printing error: it look egregious. I like the asymmetry, but there is some sort of mottled grey texture behind the majority of the page which is grating. I appreciate that the cover depicted on the device is identical to that of the actual magazine. As for the exaltation due to the 'feat' that it ""immediately displays how I can use the device in real life,"" I don't believe that that is unique to the ad. Most advertisements show how the product can be used. That sort of how ads work. There's very little value in showing a product that isn't functioning or showing a feature or facet that the product doesn't have.<p>It's a passable ad, nothing more.",1353890944

4829850,comment,4829687,4829687,1,0,DenisM,,,"The problem with blind hashing is that database transaction log likely has enough data to link blind hash back to the user record. Further, databases such as PostgreSQL or Oracle have version stamps on all records, which allows precise calculation of record age, allowing them to be linked together. MSSQL, depending on your index structure(I.e. if you use heaps), migh also betray the fact that records were created at the same time due to ordering of records. Most certainly, page allocation algorithm is likely to betray some of the same, albeit with less precision.<p>Bottom line is that if you're worried about database file or backup leaks, blind hashing is not adding meaningful security. It only helps with SQL injection and text dump vectors.<p>Edit: Duh, it's covered further in the slides!",1353890784

My imaginary scenario is a theorem validator built by mathematicians from pre-Cantor days, where I conjecture that it would be hard to encode transfinite proofs. As I know nothing about how theorem provers work, this is purely conjectural.<p>In more concrete terms .. and I am so far outside my knowledge that I barely know what I am saying ... I read in the Coq FAQ that ""The axiom of unique choice together with classical logic (e.g. excluded-middle) are inconsistent in the variant of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions where Set is impredicative. As a consequence, the functional form of the axiom of choice and excluded-middle, or any form of the axiom of choice together with predicate extensionality are inconsistent in the Set-impredicative version of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions.""<p>In other words, proofs involving ""axiom of unique choice together with classical logic"" cannot be expressed in at least Coq. While it might be possible to use a machine to check tools which assume the axiom of unique choice, it would no doubt take a lot of work if one needs to build such a system from scratch.<p>And that is the scenario - where it's much more difficult to develop a mechanical tool than to come up with a proof that enough for humans - that I am contemplating.",1353890052

Most of the time, it turns out to reduce to group theory (e.g. Galois theory basically consists of reducing the study of fields to the study of groups). Sometimes you come up with a novel structure about which you can say something. Occasionally, this gives you a result that feeds back into another branch of mathematics, or even into number theory - as with Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. But most of the time, this is just some funny structure and you say ""well, that's nice"" and move on.<p>So Mochizuki has almost certainly defined some new objects and proven some things about them. But mathematicians do that all the time (admittedly on a smaller scale). If you just want to look at something, there's plenty of ""new territory"" around - stuff that doesn't require learning a new notation, and hasn't had Mochizuki looking at it for ten years already. The only reason some arbitrary new structure is interesting enough to spend your time learning about is if you can tie it back to number theory.",1353889696

It's one thing for a open source clone of github to exist, it's another thing if it's something that IT needs to install and manage in your organization. On the other hand, your text editor, debugger, etc, are all things that IT doesn't care about beyond if it is installed and runs. So, the value of B2D is beyond the functionality of the tools per se but it's also the additional benefit of not having to run the service yourself to get its benefits.

Experienced political organizers already know this, which is why so much effort goes into courting the endorsements of unions like AFT, NEA, AFSCME and SEIU and churches and their leaders like Billy Graham.<p>These <i>ARE</i> social networks, and they're WIRED, and have a lot of structure at the local level where, as O'Neil instructs us, is where all politics is anyways. Any up-start ""political social network"" that ignores that existing infrastructure is like Facebook ignoring colleges.",1353888381

It'll be interesting to see what those women have to say.<p>It might be the case that this strikes me as a man's writing just because there are more men in tech, but I don't know that it's the incompetence per se.  It's sentences like, ""Often in this situation Ill break out something like the Saxo board, with an FPGA and a thick USB 2.0 pipe,"" that I just have a very hard time imagining a woman writing.  In the same way that a woman couldn't have written Cory Doctorow's Little Brother.  I think it's the implied, ""I'm so cool because of all my techno whizbangs.""  But it's even in the non-tech writing: ""In other words, I wanted to hack something I actually use: my vagina."" is so horrid that I have to believe that even the bona fide female Xeni Jardin, lover of techno whizbangs, would have a hard time accepting it as... womanly... to talk about ""using her vagina"".<p>My girlfriend has screamed at me more than once over the futility of sharing my thoughts with ""you people"" who ""will never understand [my] perspective"", but at least a few here are kind, even if I'm not, and for that I'm grateful.",1353888363

It's a costly and long sales cycle. Not to mention the margins are increasingly getting worse (both from software vendors, i.e. SaaS, and service vendors, i.e. outsourcing). Then couple that with increasingly changing buying behaviors and pricing models (consumerization of IT) and it's not all roses.",1353888031

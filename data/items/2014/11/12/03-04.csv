8593935,comment,8593107,8593107,0,0,AndrewKemendo,,,"Great talk, however probably the #1 thing that is most frustrating about the startup ecosystem is the idea that management principles are an afterthought - this despite the fact that they are among the top reasons why companies fail. Ben&#x27;s talk really reinforces two things that always stand out to me about the SV ecosystem:<p>1. Management abilities aren&#x27;t valued in founders<p>2. It&#x27;s almost 100% a finance game<p>To the first point, if you go back and listen to the first day, Sam talks about how young/inexperienced founders are probably the best at identifying new opportunities, and it would follow then that they are the best founders. This is in direct contrast to the idea of being good at hard management tasks like the ones that Ben brings up here. Also in contrast to the talk that PG gave in the same series about waiting to be a founder and his discussions about founders who are over 30. This is reinforced by the idea that a lot of Angel/VC money seems to be going to young, inexperienced founders who have a little traction.<p>Which leads me to think that, in actuality the funding sources do care about management, they just don&#x27;t think it matters at the outset because they plan on bringing in &quot;real&quot; management at some point along the way. This is reinforced both by just looking at the history of high growth companies and in something one of my advisers sent me from Kaufmann and it was the Valuation worksheet [1]. you&#x27;ll notice that a key determinant of valuation is: &quot;founder willing to step aside if necessary for a new CEO.&quot; With anything but yes basically ending a deal.<p>To further the point, Ben&#x27;s great walk-through of Sam&#x27;s equity/vesting blog post really reinforces the notion that to get value out of this whole startup thing as anything <i>but</i> and investor you really have to be lucky and savvy, and really hope that your investors have your best interest in mind. To me that is the kind of &quot;dirty secret,&quot; which isn&#x27;t so much of a secret anymore, of Silicon Valley. When someone mentioned during the video making more &quot;incentive to stay&quot; with a company, this is exactly the kind of talk I expect from the Gordon Gecko types, not the Wozniak-esque communal tech focused, make great things founder. While I doubt the person shouting that intended for it to come across quite as nihilistic, the unintended truth came out. Baking in equity incentives that promote retention are probably not good for employees in a competitive market, and thus not good for morale and &quot;culture&quot; in the long run, especially given the average shelf life of a startup.<p>Edit: Just so this isn&#x27;t completely negative, I think the startup world really has the ability to have a big impact on management trends worldwide. We have seen this to a degree with the &quot;rise of the developer,&quot; however generally speaking things are about the same structurally for employees even if the term sheets are more founder friendly than the 2000s. What thought leaders should be pushing in my opinion is the idea of flat organizations like Morning Star [2], and to a lesser extent Valve. The real revolution in management is having as little as possible and I don&#x27;t hear that coming from the SV VC/Angels, yet we hear alot about board seats, equity/vesting etc...<p>[1]Page 16: <a href=""http://www.angelcapitalassociation.org/data/Documents/Resources/AngelCapitalEducation/ACEF_-_Valuing_Pre-revenue_Companies.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.angelcapitalassociation.org/data/Documents/Resour...</a><p>[2]<a href=""https://hbr.org/2011/12/first-lets-fire-all-the-managers/ar/1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hbr.org/2011/12/first-lets-fire-all-the-managers/ar/...</a>",1415764574

8593929,comment,8592597,8593831,0,0,goblin89,,,"> I think the point is that college exposes you to unlike-minded people. You can find plenty of people who share your interests on IRC or Hacker News. You can also find people who don&#x27;t share your interests on the Internet, but realistically, you won&#x27;t.<p>This ‘like-unlike-minded’ categorization seems dubious to me. It can be said as well that college throws together the like-minded (they all felt the need to go to college); and Hacker News throws together the unlike-minded (because vaguely IT-related interests is all we have in common).<p>> [College] throws you together with people that you would never hang out with by choice, and so forces you to broaden your perspective.<p>Plausible, though it remains your speculation (<i>you</i> went to college). I don’t see how college is radically different from working in various workplaces with respect to perspective-broadening.<p>> But there&#x27;s something that changes in your brain when you&#x27;re forced to re-examine your most basic beliefs from the perspective of someone who doesn&#x27;t share them, and it&#x27;s a transferrable skill.<p>Related: <a href=""http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2014/11/05/dont-surround-yourself-with-smarter-people/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2014/11/05/dont-surround-yourself-...</a>, a great essay that expounds on this point.",1415764429

8593926,comment,8592979,8592979,0,0,programminggeek,,,"A college professor explained to me in my senior capstone business strategy class why share buybacks are a terrible idea. They signal to investors that you have nothing better to do with the money than buy your own stock.<p>Instead of investing in R&D, buying assets, streams of income, creating new products, renovating facilities, or even paying your own people, a stock buyback says that all of those things are basically a worse ROI on the business than just handing the money over to shareholders.<p>In general, I think my professor was right. I think there are good reasons to potentially buy out investors and so on, but usually these programs are done under the guise of making shareholders richer, but I just don&#x27;t see that as the case.<p>The best way to enrich shareholders is by simply giving them a dividend, or by running a more profitable business (which will drive up the stock price).<p>Everything else is basically financial machinations that look good, but are mostly meaningless.",1415764339

FWIW, I teach at a university, but this is just my own opinion and others might disagree.<p>> <i>My perspective is that as a student, I don&#x27;t stand out. My grades/ECs/etc are not very exceptional. However, as a &quot;rogue&quot; (for lack of a better term) developer, I do stand out.</i><p>It is easy to stand out as a student: attend lecture every day, show up early and sit in the front row, prepare for the lectures by reading the assigned and optional readings in advance, ask questions that help you deepen your understanding of the material (not questions that are designed to &quot;show off,&quot; if your understanding of the material is much deeper than what the class covers, don&#x27;t be an asshole, but do ask questions before and after lecture), and use the resources the class has made available to you to understand the subject as well as you can.<p>I&#x27;ve had students &quot;stand out&quot; despite getting Cs on all the tests, because they&#x27;ve clearly busted their ass to get a C and had a good attitude about it. I&#x27;ve also had completely anonymous students get As.<p>If you work hard at the class and are also any good at the subject, you&#x27;ll stand out even more. And, just in case you need this advice later (this is actually for you, Miles), you can actually pull this off without being enrolled at the university and can probably hustle/charm your way into enrollment at Berkeley if you ever decide you need it. The same thing applies: take classes you&#x27;re interested in (through UC&#x27;s extension education program), show up, work hard, and engage with the Prof. Undergrad enrollment numbers can make that tricky, but that&#x27;s literally how I got into grad school.

A cursory read will tell you that the following quote is completely false:<p>&quot;There are two ways of looking at this. The first is that IBM spent $13.859 billion buying back those 73 million shares — an average of $190 per share. But in fact the share count only fell by 50 million shares, which means that IBM actually paid $277 per share by which the share count was reduced. That’s a crazy sum of money, far greater than IBM’s all-time-high share price. (The current price, by the way, is $162.)<p>The other way of looking at this is that the $13.859 billion didn’t really go entirely to shareholders, as Sorkin implies. Rather, some 50/73 of it went to shareholders — that’s about $9.5 billion — while the rest of it, about $4.4 billion, went, in one way or another, to employees. And especially to senior employees.&quot;<p>Without boring everyone to tears the author makes the completely false assumption that new shares issued are issued at $0 (however employees exercised 5.6m shares at $90 a share, or say the 1.5m shares employees purchased at a 5% discount to market price, there are a whole host of other programs)",1415762654

At some point, the software must be developed on the OS it runs on, and most software will be for mainstream users (outside of server-side code).

You can find plenty of people who share your interests on IRC or Hacker News.  You can also find people who <i>don&#x27;t</i> share your interests on the Internet, but realistically, you won&#x27;t.  The true learning experience of college is that it throws you together with people that you would never hang out with by choice, and so forces you to broaden your perspective.<p>In practical terms, you will probably never hang out with these people after graduation.  Most likely, they will be useless for your career (although you never can be sure - I co-founded my first startup with my floormate from sophomore year).  But there&#x27;s something that changes in your brain when you&#x27;re forced to re-examine your most basic beliefs from the perspective of someone who doesn&#x27;t share them, and it&#x27;s a transferrable skill.  You may very well decide that you were right the first time (my goals, strengths, and skills are not hugely different from what I believed in high school), but you see a whole new level of nuance that&#x27;s missing when everyone around you self-selects into the same groups.<p>It&#x27;s certainly <i>possible</i> to get this experience outside of college.  But it&#x27;s much, much harder, because you are looking for something outside of your own conscious awareness.  I think one of PG&#x27;s essays once said &quot;Do whatever seems harder&quot;, which is pretty good advice.

Most of my life was spent going from country to country, with all of my possessions able to fit in two bags. I was also reduced to the shirt on my back a couple of times in business ventures gone wrong.\nWhat I&#x27;ve discovered is that there aren&#x27;t actually <i>that</i> many things to get. A bed, a dresser, a kitchen table and chairs, a couch, a coffee table, a TV, stand, amp and some speakers, living room chairs, a desk + chair, a bookshelf.\nAfter that it&#x27;s outfitting the kitchen and bathroom, clothing, and some art for the walls.\nThat covers the necessities. Beyond that it&#x27;s just supporting your hobbies & things you do for fun.\nThe other 2% are things like a car (I just use Zipcar for now), some of the more high tech gizmos for the kitchen, more camping gear, good pots & pans once I get better at cooking - Stuff I can live without, so I&#x27;m content to wait for a really great deal before buying. The best part is finding something you know you&#x27;ll need eventually (because it&#x27;s on your list), but it&#x27;s available now at a deep discount because some shopkeeper is desperate to be rid of it.<p>That&#x27;s actually the key: having the ability to be patient. For about a year, I kept a list of everything I wanted to buy, including links to what were the best in each area. Then I&#x27;d keep an eye out for sales, check out garage sales & flea markets, go to second hand stores, surplus stores, etc. I tried to not buy unless I could get it for 70-80% off the new price or better, while still of acceptable quality. For brand new stuff over $50, I&#x27;d usually only buy at 40% off or better. To completely furnish my place with stuff I&#x27;ll never replace, I spent about $2000 over the course of a year. Some stuff was free. Some stuff was damn near free (my solid oak desk was $20) Some stuff I ended up paying a fair price for, because I would accept no substitute. My biggest purchase was a 50&quot; TV for $500, which I&#x27;ll keep for the next 10 years or so unless it actually breaks. My older, 8 year old 32&quot; TV I now use as an external monitor. It still works like the day I bought it, but then again I also researched the shit out of it before buying (Sharp Aquos, on sale 40% off).<p>The best part about buy-it-for-life stuff is that a used item is just as good as a new.<p>The research is slow and tedious. The key is to not be in a hurry. There is a finite amount of stuff to get, and you can probably survive without it for awhile.",1415762010

Data tells us how the world looks, but whereas in nature the laws are fixed (or so we hope), society is very fluid. This can confuse people. Any data about society is a snapshot of current conditions: it doesn&#x27;t mean that things have never been different or won&#x27;t be different, and it most certainly does not tell us that this is how things <i>should</i> be (the latter is the biggest difference between the natural and the social sciences -- in nature there&#x27;s only &quot;is&quot; while in society there&#x27;s &quot;is&quot; and &quot;ought&quot; and the two are rarely the same; also, we have at least some power over the structure of our society, while changing nature can be tricky).<p>This is why data means very different things in physics and sociology, and why -- at least by default, or until proven otherwise -- any sociological data should be understood as: this is how things currently are; should we try to change them?",1415761834

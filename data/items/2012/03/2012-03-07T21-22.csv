IIRC, Dylan's ""init-value"" for class slots did much the same thing.<p>But really, this question only tells you whether a candidate is lying about Python experience on their rsum. If the candidate answers, ""I have no idea. But I have 5 years of Ruby experience, and many years of Perl before that, and I can be competent in Python within a month or so,"" this question tells you nothing either way.<p>I've always been delighted to hire a really good programmer.

The ratings are more 'tuned' to a foodie mindset, plus they separate out food from price, which avoids the common problem you see on Yelp.<p>I recall seeing 5-stars for a sushi restaurant on Yelp, and after an incredibly disappointing meal, I went back to the site and read the reviews. They were all along the lines of ""Sushi for under $4!  Awesome!."" I don't care if it's 4$. If it's bad sushi, it doesn't matter if it's free. I'd rather eat something else. Or maybe the food is great but the service sucks. By conflating all of these categories into a single rating, you end up with ratings that aren't very useful to a lot of people.<p>No doubt, personalized ratings are the way to go in the future - but none of the apps I've seen (Ness included) seem to do a very good job of this yet.",1331156376
3677382,comment,3676847,3676847,8,0,sedev,,,"I wish the article headline had said that the piece was by a restauranteur. Most of what they have to say about Yelp falls under the heading of ""more of the same.""<p>I think that restaurant and venue owners are <i>wrong</i> to hate Yelp - but it's understandable that they do. The reasons that they do are interesting. My take on it is that Yelp is disruptive to a lot of the traditional restaurant practices. Restaurant owners resent Yelp because it feels like they're adding more work to what is already a job that requires 80-hour weeks.  Previously, restaurant owners had more message control about their venue's location, because social information like ""is the Foo Pizzeria any good?"" had more friction, it spread more slowly, and it degraded over time.<p>A Yelp review has low friction because it gets automatically ingested into Yelp's data set, it spreads quickly, and it doesn't degrade over time - it stays around on the site. If you're a business with a small number of reviews, it doesn't take many one-stars to make you look unappealing, and Yelp's attempts to be user-friendly mean that you're presented among a crowd of your competitors unless you earn a clickthrough. Like being on a crowded shelf at the supermarket, you're at the mercy of the visitor.<p>One interpretation of this would be to say that restauranteurs' reaction is ""Hey! Shouldn't my success be tied to what <i>I do,</i> not to what a stranger on the Internet <i>inflicts</i> on me?"" That's a reasonable objection - and that's why Yelp has invested a shit-ton of engineer-hours into filtering reviews. Filtering reviews is something that benefits both restauranteurs and users - it's just that the former tend to be ungrateful pricks about it because ""filtering"" includes ""removing algorithmically detectable friends-and-family five-star reviews."" Which leads to the other big interpretation - that restauranteurs are reacting badly to their customers' newfound ability to hold them accountable. We humans are dumb monkeys with a truckload of cognitive biases: we <i>hate</i> being held accountable. I look at articles like this one and I see big parallels to other whiny people who suddenly are brought into accountability and are resisting it.<p>The thing is that the restauranteurs, like the MPAA or the newspaper industry, <i>cannot</i> win this one in the long term (at least not on the terms that they now use to define ""winning""). There's no way to keep people from talking about your business. There's no way to keep people from talking about the things they enjoy. There's no way to keep people from taking the easy way - ""I feel like pizza, I'll look it up on Yelp"" - instead of a harder way - ""I feel like pizza, let's see which of my friends knows where the pizzerias are around here, which of them are available, what their phone numbers and/or locations are, or I know, I could go get the huge inconvenient yellow pages and make a choice based on how much they spent on advertising!"" Computing devices will get more convenient to use, not less, knowledge will get easier to share, not less, and the cost of querying the Internet's collective opinion will be cheaper, not more expensive. The restaurant and venue owners are never, ever going to win this the way they want to - again like the MPAA and newspapers, the cat is entirely out of the bag.<p>Basically what I think they should do about it is<p>* Stop whining<p>* Read Seth Godin<p>* Compete instead of sue<p>As an aside, I've found Yelp very useful over time with the addition of a few mental filters.<p>* Judge places by the review histogram, not by individual reviews<p>* Trust the collective opinion far more than individual reviews, especially for places with 100+ reviews<p>* Assume that anything at 3.5 stars or above is Good Enough, and use other sources when you want to have rarefied tastes catered to (Yelp started out as being mostly for foodies - I think it's moved out of that, and that if you are or desire to become a serious foodie, you should release yourself from caring about Yelp)",1331156359

Making pixel-perfect ""@2x"" graphics is much easier.<p>Then again, maybe those hints are only necessary because of the limitations of low resolution displays.

I realized that this seemed to be a Microsoft strategy: obsolete the old knowledge and watch the developers pay money for the new hotness.   I'm not saying that MS needs to be static, but there appears to <i>me</i> to be a deep seated instability in their approach, which implies pretty heavy retraining every five years.

      print(""using default arguments [1, 3]"")
      return [1, 3]

    def append_five(a=default()):

I expect you to know the ""detail"" of python handling default arguments, even tough it's non obvious anyone with decent amount of experience in python has probably been bitten by that behavior, you'd have to be a master bullshitter to guess that one. Similarly there are many such nuggets that could be used to determine if someone has actual experience/skill with the language/tools vs. reading the brochure before the interview and did his homework in college.<p>But this is not the same as asking what package contains what class, and similar petty details that you think are good questions because you looked them up in the documentation before the interview.

Moreover, the argument I'd posited earlier doesn't hinge on the refinement--the sheer issues of scale of processing for ingress that much raw material are what gets in the way. Then you also have to dispose of the waste tailings.<p>As for the refining... look at a pic from an '84 processing plant (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gas_centrifuge_cascade.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gas_centrifuge_cascade.jpg</a>).

As as a general rule of thumb, a cascade of 850 to 1,000 centrifuges, each 1.5 meters long, operating continuously at 400 m/sec, would be able to produce about 20-25 kilograms of HEU in a year, enough for one weapon.""</i><p>Even going with the factor of 20 speedup (overestimation from your provided article with the SILEX quote), we would expect to need 50 centrifuges, on the order of 1.5m long each--that's quite a lot. There's also the supporting equipment, power conditioners and piping and so forth.<p>In fact, powering the entire apparatus is also a big concern. The article I linked suggests a power draw on the order of several hundred thousand kilowatt-hours (compare with around six thousand for a normal home per year) per year. So, again, I don't see the garage fab making sense.<p>Oh, and during all that time?<p>You bet your ass the government is datamining your browsing history, purchase orders, and hobbies.

It was a good time, full of C++ jobs and my skills and my market seemed to be in harmony.  I put my resume out there on the still-so-new-it-shined internet and immediately got over a dozen calls, the vast majority being from 3rd-party recruiters.<p>I complained to my wife after the third call in a row and she explained to me that I should never be upset when someone called because they wanted to get me a job.  She had endured a lot of unemployment in her family and a call from a recruiter was a cause for celebration, not complaint.  From that point on, I've never complained about a call or email from a recruiter.<p>2002 and 2003 were some lean years for software jobs and those calls became few and far between.  Now the phone is ringing again, and I don't even have my resume posted anywhere.  Still, I won't complain and I haven't blocked emails from any recruiter.<p>I actually go out of my way to respond to recruiters that seem halfway decent or better.  A couple have expressed grateful surprise and I've made new connections that may work out in the future.  The awful ones aren't blocked (at least none have been so awful to merit blocking so far), but I don't respond to them either.  I just keep the channel open in case times do get lean once again.<p>The third-party recruiter model may indeed be broken, and, with a few exceptions, isn't a fit for the startup world.

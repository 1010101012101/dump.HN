6505421,comment,6504645,6505207,31,0,lamby,,,"Mmm. I inherited a rather hardcore strain of liking entirely deterministic builds from being a Debian Developer and would never give up the dependability of it now. In fact, the thought of a build process connecting to the internet to download code just seems so utterly broken in my world view I actually find it difficult to explain it properly to others.<p>I&#x27;d love to be able to do it without embedding code copies, or at least have a smarter system than that.",1381093187

They happen to own the government.  No great surprise the feds back student loans and encourage the myth of a STEM shortage, feed more minds into the gristle mill.  You don&#x27;t need some kind of actively managed centrally controlled conspiracy, you just need individual actors following their own pocketbooks.<p>In the modern era, lets say post 1990, as a scientist, if you studied hard and worked hard, before you got downsized for being too old, you might make some factory owner in China who stole your idea and research, and the Chinese .gov bribe takers, very rich.  The local management makes all their money off non-scientific stuff like social networks and chat programs, so they certainly don&#x27;t need science, they&#x27;ve pivoted out of the physical market and left it for the Chinese.  Because the rich guys own the government, the .gov also don&#x27;t care much anymore.<p>The best hope for modern scientists is to hope for sponsorship / patronage from the Chinese government and hope they can outperform the more numerous locals.  Good Luck, you&#x27;ll need it.",1381093179

Everything worked out of the box, and in the one case I had an issue (related to reinstalling the OS from a thumb drive), the System76 tech support was absolutely fantastic. Got a direct line to someone who knew all about Linux internals and was able to fix my problem before I could finish articulating it. And for less than the price of a Macbook Pro, I got an i7 processor, two hard drives (Ubuntu preinstalled on a 128GB SSD + a 500GB HD for storage), a beautiful 1080p matte screen, a nice graphics card, and 16GB of RAM. Like I said, this was two years ago and it&#x27;s still better than most laptops you can get in the price range. The only downside is that the thing is like 6 pounds and sucks up power, but as desktop replacements go I think it would be hard to find better. So the options are there, just not in retail stores yet.<p>Unfortunately, they seem to have cut the price and removed the discrete graphics card option from the current Gazelle Professional. I guess that makes sense given the state of Linux gaming, but being able to run CUDA on a $1200 laptop was pretty awesome :(",1381092965

You verify the problem exists.  The customer reports that the system didn&#x27;t have the problem last week Tuesday.  If you want to know why, tagged releases (and a record of them -- incidentally, another one of the 643 things to know is &quot;All deploys should be recorded somewhere&quot;) let you travel in time back to the software in use last Tuesday, verify if the customer&#x27;s recollection is accurate (well, sorta), and then compare just what has changed rather than trying to run down the bug  without any historical context.<p>Naming things also lets you talk about them, which is helpful, because you&#x27;ll want to talk about individual releases of the software.  (I mean, sure, you could use random hexadecimal numbers, but for whatever reason people find production_release_20131007_3 a bit more informative than 066630de00d242137efab6bf21b8ea04aeee7a1d.  One glance at the first one tells you that it&#x27;s the 3rd deploy from October 7th, assuming you&#x27;ve used the company&#x27;s naming convention for more than a minute.  The second one tells you nothing and is difficult to pull useful information out of without having to manually cross-tabulate it with you git repository, which would be unfortunate if it were e.g. attached to a log file, customer support request, or Wiki article about known-good releases for interacting with external systems.)",1381092745

Because it&#x27;s not like <i>you&#x27;re</i> trying to make a (conservative) political point every time I see one of your comments.<p>The problem with the data you&#x27;ve cited is that it actually shows the problem you&#x27;re dismissing: science funding has declined in real terms (let alone inflation-adjusted terms) since the end of the Clinton administration.  There&#x27;s been a huge bloodletting -- across the board -- over the last 13 years.  An entire generation of US scientists has been decimated by pointless budget cuts.<p>If you don&#x27;t know anything at all about science, you might look at the overall trend of this graph and say: &quot;science funding has gone up since 1976, so shut up and stop whining&quot;.  This is the simpleton&#x27;s interpretation of the graph.  A more nuanced interpretation is that we invested billions of dollars into training of new scientists starting in the Clinton administration (~1996), and right about the time those new scientists hit the point in their careers when they needed funding to really get their labs started (~2000), we stranded them.  There&#x27;s an entire generation of scientists with structural under-employment because of this phenomenon, and yes, they&#x27;re leaving the country (I personally know a few who have, and I can&#x27;t fault their reasoning.  You go where you can work.  If I were still doing science, I&#x27;d probably be gone, too.)<p>But that&#x27;s not even the most important story.  An <i>intelligent</i> observer looks at this graph and says:  the US budget for 2013 is <i>$3.8 TRILLION</i>.  We spend <i>$600 BILLION</i> on the department of defense, and nearly <i>$900 BILLION</i> on Social Security (aka: old people who contribute almost nothing to the growth of the economy).  Yet we&#x27;re trying to &quot;save money&quot; by shaving a few tens of billions (that&#x27;s 0.8% of total federal spending, in case you&#x27;re bad at math) off of the one tiny part of our government that has consistently delivered outsized real returns to the economy.  Any economist -- conservative or liberal -- will tell you that you don&#x27;t make your budget by nibbling at the smallest line items while ignoring big expenses.<p>This is what we call &quot;cutting off your nose to spite your face&quot;.

He suggests cutting back on unnecessary long distance travel. And if you have ever seen scientists&#x27; travel schedules, you might be inclined to agree. I find it bizarre that those people who should be the first to understand climate change are among the most active producers of CO2.<p>As a grad student I once flew half way around the world (18 hours + 2 hours flight time) to present a paper to a room of 10 people who had traveled similar distances to get there. Because the paper was more or less mistakenly assigned to a &quot;robots for hazardous environments&quot; session, exactly none of the people in the audience cared. And because I was last to present in a session of 6 presentations and the 5th presenter didn&#x27;t show up, I started mine ahead of schedule. A few acquaintances who wanted to stop by just to see me present came in just after I finished. Nobody gained anything from this 15 minute presentation.<p>If I had skipped the trip, my paper would not have been included in the conference proceedings. Publishing papers at conferences is one thing you have to do to be considered a successful scientist and this was only my second conference paper. The story is only one anecdote, but the entire system of science is built around encouraging people to travel long distances frequently. It&#x27;s stupid.",1381092233

With Bedrock Linux, you can use packages aimed at other distros without alteration.<p>- With Bedrock Linux you don&#x27;t need to compile anything - you can grab the binary package straight.  Or you can compile if you want - with Bedrock Linux, you can use AUR/yaourt/packer/etc from Arch or portage from Gentoo, if you wish.<p>- With Bedrock Linux, the special stuff is integrated deeply into the system.  AUR/yaourt is optional on Arch - on Bedrock, if you ignore the Bedrock-specific subsystems you&#x27;ll have an <i>extremely</i> minimal and near useless system.<p>- Bedrock Linux&#x27;s design results in some neat side-effects for things like robustness against broken packages/clients.  I completely fubar&#x27;d the /lib -> /usr/lib move in my Arch client on Bedrock, and most if not all of my Arch packages broke.  However, the core system continued to work, and I could still use packages from other distros.  So I installed whatever packages I cared about from Debian Sid for the time being.

6505235,comment,6504502,6505169,2,0,pdonis,,,"<i>The BEST way to satisfy the stockholders is to create a fantastic product that users love, long-term.</i><p>In other words, you agree with me that a publicly traded company must make decisions that benefit the stockholders. You just think that &quot;benefit the stockholders&quot; should be evaluated on a long-term basis, not a short-term basis. But there are two key points that you have not mentioned:<p>(1) Creating a fantastic product that users love benefits the stockholders to the extent that users are a source of revenue. In Amazon&#x27;s case, they are, directly; revenue comes from users coming to the site and buying stuff. (And from buying services like Amazon Prime.) In FB&#x27;s case, users are, at best, an indirect revenue source: more users spending more time on FB means more ad revenue. That&#x27;s a much weaker link between a good user experience and stockholder benefit.<p>(2) How long-term the calculation of &quot;stockholder benefit&quot; should be depends on the stockholder&#x27;s time horizon. If I&#x27;m investing in a company as a means of giving myself retirement income in 30 years, obviously I&#x27;m interested in the company&#x27;s long-term health, not the next quarter&#x27;s returns. But if I&#x27;m investing on a shorter time horizon, I&#x27;m going to want benefits to show up more quickly.<p>Half a century ago, most stock ownership was by individuals, so the scenario of someone buying shares in, say, IBM and holding them until retirement was actually common enough to have a significant effect. But now most stock ownership is by mutual funds; my 30-year retirement income doesn&#x27;t depend on how any single stock does for 30 years, only on how my mutual fund does over that time horizon. Mutual funds trade individual stocks all the time based on short-term performance, so to the companies, it looks like everyone&#x27;s time horizon is a lot shorter, and they act accordingly.<p><i>I&#x27;m not looking to get rich quick. I&#x27;m looking to do cool and interesting things.</i><p>Just to be clear, I am not saying you are wrong at all in having this attitude.

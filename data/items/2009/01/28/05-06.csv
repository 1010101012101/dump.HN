What should be done about anti-democratic parties in a democratic society? Those kinds of things.<p>I am coming to the conclusion that you hit a breaking point if this becomes to big an issue. Sure it's ok to handle it one way or another if the above party is at <5%. But once they near the 50% mark, it's game over. You cannot defend democracy or freedom without compromising it.<p>Same goes in this case. When it's a once a year case, that's one thing.

Culture is always brainwash.""<p>Your logic is bad.<p>I more-or-less agree that ""culture is always brainwash."" The logical follow-up is not, ""Let's therefore accept all cultures that don't immediately, viscerally violate our sense of right and wrong""; it's, ""Wow, culture is fundamentally really messed up! But I don't want to live in a society that eliminates it completely. How much messed-up-ness am I willing to endure to get the benefits of culture -- namely, consistency in what I'm expected to deal with every day, social stability, a sense of unity with my neighbors and countrymen, a sense of heritage, and various intangibles?""<p>> ""I am saying we need to be careful of what we are criticising. A lot of cultural norms are always arbitrary.""<p>So criticize all of them! The problem here is that you're working off the premise that our own cultural norms are somehow above critique, which is simply untrue.<p>However, I think that, even on close inspection, many of our culture's norms do more good than harm. I honestly think that most Americans would be (marginally) unhappier if it became culturally acceptable in America to walk naked in public (even if we let a generation pass so that there's no cultural shock) -- whereas I'm quite certain that at least a majority of people living in societies that force women to cover themselves and act subservient would be happier if their communities' cultural norms allowed women to act like women of first-world democracies. <i>That's</i> what distinguishes our cultural norms from theirs.

453374,comment,453277,453277,0,0,patio11,,,"I think pre-fab homes is a wonderful idea and wish it would take off more.  Imagine if we built cars like we built homes:<p>1)  They'd be hand-assembled by local artisans...<p>2)  ... in your driveway.<p>3)  The median production run would be 1 vehicle.<p>4)  The design would be done from scratch every single time.<p>5)  There would be no Blue Book, because no two cars worth buying are identical.  If you want to know what your car is worth, you have to hire an appraiser.  His job is to go around the neighborhood looking at all the cars, identify those that are ""comparable"" to your car, and then see how much they have sold for recently.  Then, after having done that, he picks a random number.  Stick a dollar sign in front of it and that is what your car is worth.<p>6)  Your new car will need to be exhaustively safety tested, since it has never been built before.  Don't worry, your local government has a body whose only job is to promulgate and enforce safety codes for cars built within its jurisdiction.  These codes are incompatible with the codes for another car driven a mere six blocks from yours.<p>7)  Economies of scale?  Hah!<p>8)  There would be so much uncertainty in selling cars, because so much of them was one-off, that you'd need two <i>teams</i> of overpaid professionals to actually sell one.  (One team would include, at a minimum, a broker, a lawyer, and an appraiser.)<p>9)  You might not have the foggiest clue of industrial design, but don't worry, you'll be asked to make all sorts of decisions on the design of your automobile anyway.  From ""How many cupholders do you want?"" to ""Here are forty-seven types of available sheet glass -- what do you want your windows made of?""<p>10)  Essentially all the used cars on the markets will have  been built as cluelessly as #9 suggests.<p>11)  You would never know the exact price of a car before commissioning it.  Car artisans would routinely miss price and delivery targets.  They use the excuse that you had no clue what you were doing when you gave them the directions that they asked for, which is true as far as it goes.",1233120893

Chrome is not cross-platform (yet). More importantly if it makes my windows experience good, then fuck other platforms.<p>Not even because of the memory requirements. If I browse the web I want my computer 100% used up to make the absolute best experience for myself. If I want a browser and play a video game I would hope my OS can page-swap (IE8 was supposed to have a huge memory footprint).<p>Why? Because of plugins. Making plugins for firefox is encouraged, supported, free, and more importantly firefox is built on being customizeable. IE... not so much. And since most geeks and technology enthusiasts don't use IE I won't resort to hoping the corporations who want to build IE plugins to stay competitive to be my sources for features.<p>Sure the argument can be ""why use plugins, the browser should do what you want"" but that one dies rather quickly. MS is realizing why they are losing market share. Once IE6 dies it's market share will drop even further. The only reason why my company uses IE6 all over is because of some crappy old programs that just work on IE6. So why the hell would they want to upgrade? They don't even use those for regular internet browsing.<p>Now a direct critique to the claim that IE8 loads faster. How can something that has an over 100 meg memory footprint to just start up (last numbers I have) start faster than something with just a few megs unless it is pre-fetched by windows vista on startup, in which case this is not a fair comparison, thats more like cheating.",1233120446
453365,comment,451432,452462,0,0,tychoish,,,"Well, I think we're using the term design in a couple of senses. The sites you provide (and dozens of others, really there are a lot of awesome sites running on Drupal) are solid, clear, high quality websites. They have good visual designs and layouts, and they have managed to scale well. This is true.<p>They aren't groundbreaking websites, however. They do their job well and all of those sites are successful because their owners/content was successful before their current drupal incarnations were developed. I'm also aware that there are some sites that have launched their 1.0's as drupal sites, I think it's pretty safe to say that these sites are familiar conceptually (like digg, like slashdot, like etc.) In that sense they don't have ""amazing"" designs.<p>Perhaps we should rephrase this as ""you will never create an innovative desgin in Drupal."" I'm generally in favor of Drupal, but I think this is probably the truth.<p>It's also not a bad thing. Websites need to excel at presenting information above all else, and drupal sites provide a lot of power to make this happen. Most websites are adjuncts to <i>other things</i> that organizations and individuals are doing, and they don't need to ""shift the paradigm of web design and architecture."" Lots of people need websites like this, and drupal's ideal for these cases.<p>---<p>I think the ""you'll never create a successful startup in Drupal,"" statement requires a bit of a clarification, but it's probably mostly true: given the constraints and assumptions of the platform, you're unlikely to create a new <i>kind</i> of website in Drupal that will succeed on the Internet. The next <i>boom</i> of new websites (like blogs in 2000, or social networking sites in 2004, or webapps in 2008) isn't going to be built in in Drupal first.<p>But it will be built in drupal <i>second</i> (maybe,) Drupal is great for making custom instances of websites that are targeted at niche/specific audiences. And that's a huge chunk of websites. It doesn't make a lot of sense to build highly local sites like ""digg-chicago"" and ""digg-Sao.Paulo"" all in custom-built perl or ruby based sites, when something like Drupal promises to make development and maintenance much more simple in the long run. These kinds of sites have a great deal of worth and potential.<p>---<p>As for lean and scalable.<p>Totally the truth. Drupal <i>can</i> scale, but it's a pain in the ass. Which means, a sliver of the <i>huge</i> gains made in development times and maintenance times is absorbed by increased architecting costs. Lots of memcache and hardware can fix this problem. But if you get to the point where you get to that level of demand, presumably you'd have to have a sysadmin on staff anyway, so I'll concede the point, but I think it may really be a draw.",1233120402

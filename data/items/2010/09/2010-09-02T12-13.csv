1656003,comment,1654936,1654936,0,0,RyanMcGreal,,,"Write a lot, as other commenters have recommended; but go beyond that and have skilled writers critique your writing. Good writing is good in large part because it avoids poor techniques. A competent editor can point out the passages in which your own writing goes awry so that you can cut them out or otherwise reform them.<p>It may seem backwards to suggest that good writing amounts mostly to writing with the bad stuff <i>subtracted</i>; but in my experience the inverse idea - that good writing amounts mostly to writing with good stuff <i>added</i> - leads to an overreliance on tricks and contrivances, i.e. preciousness.<p>There's maybe one writer in a thousand with the talent to succeed at preciousness. (Margaret Atwood comes to mind; I tend to read her books with a dictionary close at hand.) For the rest of us, the straightest path to good writing is to stop trying so hard and just aim for good structure, clarity and brevity.<p>That means you need to develop a thick skin, by which I mean a willingness to let go of the stuff that doesn't work. Few contemporary critics would regard Stephen King as a literary giant, but he clearly knows how to get the words onto the paper and into the hands of readers. His most salient writing advice? ""Kill your darlings.""",1283432279

If you didn't know better, you'd think Pinochet was more corrupt and murderous. But, Castro killed 10x as many people, tortured 100x as many, stole orders of magnitude more money and wealth...<p>There's 36 links in Castro's Wikipedia table of contents. Only four of them are mildly negative: 9 Controversy and criticism, 9.1 Human rights record, 9.2 Allegations of mismanagement, 9.3 Allegations of wealth.<p>There's 24 items in Pinochet's table of contents. 10 of them are very negative.<p>2 Military coup of 1973, 2.1 U.S. Backing of the Coup, 3 Military junta, 4.1 Allegations of fascism, 4.2 Suppression of opposition, 5 Arrest and trial in Britain, 7 Secret bank accounts, tax evasion and arms deal, 8 Human rights violations, 9.1 Demonstrations<p>If you didn't know better, you'd think Pinochet was a very bad man and Castro was a good man. But regardless of your politics, Chile is a much nicer place to live than Cuba these days, yet Cuba was a much nicer place than Chile before Castro came to power. Castro's policies destroyed Cuba. Whereas Pinochet has a mixed, but pretty good record. Hell, Chile just passed net neutrality laws last week.<p>A similar article is this one -<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_surge"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_surge</a><p>By almost all analysis and objective metrics, the 2007 troop surge worked. Violence went down, insurgency went down, attacks went down, crime went down afterwards. But if you look at the article, it's loaded with criticisms, opposition, and things unrelated to that particular military campaign. Then there's a quick blurb, ""Interpretation of the surge's results ... Whether the surge led to the improvement in Iraqi security, or other factors caused it, is disputed by some.""<p>Wikipedia is not neutral. It's edited by people who have more free time on their hands are and are more tech savvy. People with more free time who are more tech savvy tend to skew demographically, which is sad, it should be a neutral resource and would be better if it is.<p>Compare the Castro and Pinochet articles if you want to see it in action, you'd never realize that Pinochet was a much better and more effective leader. They both did bad stuff, but Pinochet did less bad stuff and more good stuff. His country was worse when he took power, and better afterwards. Cuba was much wealthier, prosperous, and better off before Castro, and is much worse now. It's a shame that this is misrepresented in Wikipedia.",1283431186

However, Wiki cultures have been difficult to keep sustainable let alone easily reproducible.<p>All non-reproducing communities need both openness to attract new people faster than people leave, but closeness to protect itself from negative people. Most wikis lack an ability to close themselves off in a non-hostile manner (i.e. 'turtle mode'). You may laud the wiki culture method of keep order, but I've helped hundreds of wikis defend themselves with ""soft security"" (<a href=""http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/SoftSecurity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/SoftSecurity</a>), and I found it is actually a cynical process.<p>In terms of keeping the culture going, since wiki process is based almost entirely in social custom, it requires a lot of human energy to teach newcomers and fend off attackers. Teaching requires more effort than physical-world communities because of the low bandwidth of communication on a wiki.<p>I think there might be a new evolution one day where some of the older wiki cultural principles will be reimagined, perhaps unknowingly, in media that has a better balance of human effort to community value.

Now if we assume that 'developer time' is an investment from the developer, then we can discuss whether apps are a bubble or not. I don't know the answer, because I don't know the numbers. We should sum up all the revenues generated by apps and divide it by the sum of all develoment time invested into apps. If this number is very low then we may speak about some kind of bubble. If we assume that users will buy even less apps in the future, then we can speak about a bubble even more.",1283430162

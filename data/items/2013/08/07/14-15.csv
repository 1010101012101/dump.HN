The example you gave of &quot;Where do we come from?&quot; is one, along with &quot;Why am I here?&quot;, &quot;What am I meant to do?&quot;, and many others.<p>Where I disagree is your leap from those questions to some notion of a &quot;higher being&quot;. First, as mentioned previously, this term is undefined and you cannot have a meaningful conversation without defining the terms. Second, we have already answered some of the &quot;big questions&quot;. We know where we come from: billions of years of evolution through natural selection. No &quot;higher beings&quot; necessary. And third, for the questions that still lack satisfactory answers, in most cases that is because they are wrong questions (<a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/og/wrong_questions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/og/wrong_questions/</a>).<p>There may very well be &quot;big questions&quot; that actually merit being asked and that may rightly be considered foundational human issues, but that does not by any means lead to the conclusion that the question of the existence of some undefined &quot;higher being&quot; is a foundational human issue.",1375887531

There is inhouse legal staff that review the work done by outside counsel, approve bills, and negotiate retainer agreements, but by far the majority work is done by outside counsel.<p>At the enterprise level, legal spend analysis is a huge deal, and yes the existing tools for electronic billing are really clunky (I work in this space).<p>%-saved is really hard to accurately calculate on a legal bill.  Often inhouse counsel will negotiate a &quot;discount&quot; with an outside firm (yay savings!), but then that firm will overbill to make up the difference, and may do so in ways that aren&#x27;t really detectable even by &quot;machine learning&quot;.  For example, they can pad their hours or add extra staff to the matter, or add some mysterious disbursements, or hell just raise their base rates next year to make up the difference.  Who is to say that &quot;REVIEW AND DISCUSS LEASE CONDITIONS AND DISCUSS SAME WITH CLIENT&quot; should have taken 2 hours instead of 4? (A real example I just pulled from a real LEDES file).<p>I did a report for a F500 company a few years ago that showed that after the switch from paper to electronic billing, savings increased (in the form of discounts and auto-adjustments made by our rules engine), but overall spend increased anyway (in the form of increased fees and hours billed).  So I&#x27;m not really sure that this is a problem that can be fixed by technology.  People are gaming the system on both sides of the transaction.",1375887401

With traditional code you have really two choices: highly-nested conditionals (or lots of utility subroutines) or using thrown errors for process control (which isn&#x27;t their purpose).  With labels, you&#x27;re using process control for process control.  In my experience, labels generally come into play for data processing, where often the desired behavior is not known until substantial decoding occurs.  For made-up instance:<p><pre><code>  var rec = dataStream.next()  // Stream sorted by lastName \n  processAtoM: while(rec) {\n    \n    // Stop at N&#x27;s\n    var lastName = rec.person.lastName.toUpperCase();\n    if(lastName === &#x27;N&#x27;) break processingLoop;\n\n    processRecord: do {\n      // We don&#x27;t want deleted records.\n      if(rec.deleted === true) break processRecord;\n\n      // We don&#x27;t want employee senior management, contractors or founders.\n      var employeeType = Persistence.employeeType.find(rec.company.employeeType);\n      if([&#x27;senior management&#x27;, &#x27;contractor&#x27;, &#x27;founder&#x27;].indexOf(employeeType) !== -1) break processRecord;\n\n      // Management was never sane about history structures.. FML\n      var history = someWackyDataStructureProcessThatIsPrettyIntensive(rec);\n      \n      // At least I can be functional with this part.\n      var totalPromotions = _.reduce(history, function(total, item) {\n        if(item.promoted || item.lastPromotion !== undefined) {\n          total += 1;\n        }\n        return total;\n      }, 0);\n \n      // After people with 2 or more promotions\n      if(totalPromotions < 2) break processRecord;\n\n      // More conditions..\n\n      // Finally, this is still an interesting record.\n      var outputRec = someFormattingProcessToOutputFormat(rec);\n      outputStream.write(outputRec);\n\n    } while (false);\n    rec = dataStream.next();\n  }</code></pre>",1375886984

You&#x27;d need shares in Apple, Samsung, Microsoft and all the other companies who abuse patent laws.

You&#x27;d also need shares in  tobacco companies, drugs companies and every other business that lobbies with the government.

Since their position is vastly different from the average person, it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to discuss them separately - which is why they&#x27;re referred to in the general sense as &quot;companies&quot; and &quot;shareholders&quot; (note that with the latter definition when used in this context it&#x27;s generally used to refer to those with more than just a tiny percentage of a share)<p>That all said, it should be noted that individuals do perform actions they wouldn&#x27;t normally agree with but do so because it&#x27;s part of the companies strategy / policy. Sometimes a persons principles are sidelined by their desire to stay employed.

In order to then see that password* you must enter your login password again, be that via Safari&#x27;s preferences dialog or the Keychain Access application. What Chrome does is it uses the <i>same</i> mechanism of storage as Safari (and indeed, requests access to the same encrypted keychain item) but never prompts the user for the login password to authenticate. This sets up a situation where Chrome actually circumvents and makes passwords originally stored in Safari <i>less secure</i> than they were initially. This is your responsibility, and no amount of theoretical grandstanding about physical access to a computer changes that.<p>You also talk about installing malicious browser extensions as another potential vector. I agree, and I think browser makers ought to take steps to require the current user to authenticate in order to install browser extensions. When you consider that a browser extension can act as man-in-the-middle to all your browser activity, it&#x27;s astonishing that this isn&#x27;t already the case. You have to prove you are the logged-in user when you change your password by providing the current password, so how is this any different?<p>When talking about security, there will always be holes, but they will be of differing practical value or risk depending on how they are exploited. Grabbing session cookies or internet history requires a certain level of technical proficiency, as does developing a malicious browser extension; installing said extension or typing chrome://settings/password into the address bar, on other hand, are easy enough that any kid who wants to get hold of his big sister&#x27;s Facebook password can give it a go. Reducing the surface area of attack is every bit as important as real security, here, and the stance you&#x27;ve set out above is that you aren&#x27;t interested in that if it doesn&#x27;t also provide real security. I think that&#x27;s the wrong thing to do, and I urge you to reconsider.<p>*As people have pointed out, you can inspect the password via web inspector etc. This is another, serious security flaw and one that I think the HTML WG ought to look into.",1375884234

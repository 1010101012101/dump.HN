If we can demostrate (traffic or increasing revenues), we should raise venture capital. Formalizing the startup, maybe the founder can be the CEO, maybe we put another expert MBA.

They were 100% a java shop and at the time I only knew c, c++, php, mysql and absolutely no java. Throughout college, I did programming jobs for small businesses and my university, making hardly any money. I studied my ass off on java, ended up being able to handle any of the simple java questions they asked and sold them on all of my experience that I put into working fulltime programming meanwhile pulling in great grades in college.<p>They knew I was under qualified from a java dev aspect, but was hired because of the dedication I showed from working throughout college. At the start I was definitely under qualified and I'd say truly knew nothing of how tech businesses run. However, with lot of dedication (and late nights) I learned a ton and quickly was tech lead of a major part of their business.<p>That was 5 years ago and have since left for more exciting opportunities.

1920648,comment,1920453,1920453,0,0,patio11,,,"My first programming ""real"" job was at a technology incubator in Japan.  I got hired on as a translator.  At the time my Japanese skills were not exactly stunning, but technical translators do not exactly grow on trees in Gifu.  (Try finding a bilingual Japanese/English CS major in Kansas.  It is about that hard.)<p>Now, here's the rub: they had five translators locked into generous long-term contracts and they only needed really one-fifth of a technical translator, plus some utility translation for ceremonies and the like.  So I went mostly unused.  After spending far too much time on the Internet (shades of things to come) and getting acclimated to working there, I started trying to make myself some more work.<p>Example: we had a website with brief bios of ~200 companies at the incubator.  This was static HTML written in DreamWeaver, and got updated once every year in Japanese and English.  This was an absolutely mammoth undertaking, primarily because the data was first compiled into a Word document, then translated, then laboriously massaged into HTML in DreamWeaver.  I thought ""Wait, this is just string processing... and I have gawk.""  I did not, in fact, actually have gawk, but my university terminal account was still open, so I wrote some scripts and shaved two man-months off the schedule.  The bosses were happy.<p>Later, after getting a little more political capital, I started getting the R&D group I was attached to to use me for their grunt work R&D.  For example, I made GUIs which called their command line tools for robot vision work, begged off implementing fast fourier transforms in C (""I'm a Java programmer!  Egads!""), did some grid computing and spam filters, and the like.  My work product was atrocious.  Demos I pronounced ""done"" functioned maybe one time in three.  We didn't use source control, which is probably for the best, because if we had someone might be able to still see the code I wrote.  However, my bosses chalked all of it up to ""Hey, we get the budget for a translator whether we want it or not, might as well get some work out of him.""<p>There were two projects of note in those three years.  One was a massive translation of CAD training software manuals for a company affiliated with the incubator.  It was 3,000 Powerpoint slides.  I got it done right before any further mention of torque would have caused my internal springs to snap.  The guy who requested it made it clear that he owed me one.  When my contract expired, I sent him an email saying that I wanted to stay in the area a while longer and wondered if he could perhaps ask around to see if anyone needed an engineer.  He called up a large company in Nagoya and informed the division chief, who owed him a favor, that there was a bilingual American engineer the company should hire.  So they shook on it, and that was that.  (We later had a job interview -- with my patron in the room and doing most of the talking -- which was mostly a formality.  The line which sticks with me is ""Oh, you're white.  Not that there is anything wrong with that.""  Nobody had thought to tell my new bosses my name prior to the interview -- it wasn't really relevant to the transaction.)<p>The other significant project is a long story.  It starts with an email from a teacher in the prefecture asking ""Is there a good way to make bingo cards?""",1290148181

Essentially, X defines an asynchronous protocol between client and server, since they may be running on different computers with hundreds of milliseconds of round-trip latency between them.<p>In most asynchronous systems like this there are race conditions that must be attended to.  Mouse-ahead is one such problem.  Imagine that you have it mapped into your muscle memory that you need to click a button to expose a menu, drop down about 40px, then release the mouse button to open a new file.  In reality that sequence of events involves a few roundtrips between you and the X client (remember, this could be up to a second).  What happens if your ""I released the mouse button"" signal is processed by the X client before it knows ""a mouse release in this part of the screen denotes that he wants to open a file""?  If you don't think about mouse-ahead beforehand, the answer is either your mouse release will be interpreted as happening as whatever is under the menu, or the mouse release will be lost forever; neither is good.<p>So pg. 6 of the linked article suggests a solution, a <i>synchronous grab</i>, in which you don't actually send the mouse release command until you know the client is ready for it.  I'd suggest reading the first few pages of the article, it's one of the more cogent descriptions of a real race condition I've encountered.",1290147495

Deep down people know that the only way to be secure is to be debt free.  Inflation really creates insecurity - you're getting squeezed from under (as in the bottom line to pay for necessities).  In that environment, having to make debt payments is scary, ESPECIALLY when the economy is crap and you could lose your job or not get pay raises.<p>Most people (rightly so) are not interested in taking on new debt during an inflationary period.  It's crazy right, economists prescribe inflation as a way to deal with ""sticky wages"" so that the real cost of employment goes down without having to negotiate wages downward.  You cannot at the same time argue that will encourage people to borrow, because debt payments are exercised nominally (and creditors often - punitively or capriciously - rack up the interest rate on top of that)  so while more of your salary is going to pay for basic necessities, that debt burden still floats on top of the budget, and possibly gets worse.",1290147480

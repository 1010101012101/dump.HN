7237914,comment,7233730,7236734,9,0,jcc80,,,"Hero worship is not the answer and may actually contribute to the problem. The solution is basic accountability ie police do not investigate themselves and a change of culture from &quot;war on crime&quot; to community policing. As someone else commented here, the police training actually turns well meaning future officers against the average citizen. An example re: accountability is the California city that significantly reduced complaints by requiring officers to wear cameras.

Many of the Romani people living in the UK come from a subgroup traditionally called &quot;Romanichal&quot;, which is very much different from the &quot;Roma&quot; group — but in conversation today the distinction does not come up and we often see news stories use &quot;Roma&quot; instead of &quot;Romani&quot;.<p>How that happened, I dunno; maybe the words just all sound the same?",1392375484

7237905,comment,7237713,7237838,1,0,RyanZAG,,,"There&#x27;s a reason data binding is popular with the JS crowd, and it&#x27;s the same reason it&#x27;s been somewhat popular with the big enterprise crowd. When your application starts getting very complicated, such as the user changing an input field that is reflected in a bunch of dynamic calculations across the app, it becomes desirable to simply change one value and have everything update. This is only desirable if your application is big enough that it&#x27;s not just easier to re-run every calculation manually.<p>Big enterprise has had this problem for a long time in their big multi window monster apps they use for stock trading, etc. JS webapps have been very simple for a long time and haven&#x27;t really needed it until recently. Now that they&#x27;re getting complex, JS devs are looking into how to solve the problem and it generally comes down to MVC OOP style or FP style. You can see these two derivatives in AnglularJS and ReactiveJS.",1392375219
7237904,comment,7237184,7237711,3,0,001sky,,,"Scarcity is rooted in social rank, it is a (by) product of psychology, and politics, not strictly speaking economics. Someone has to have the corner office, date the homecoming queen, and be the ranking executive. This is true outside of markets...just look at...firms. That&#x27;s the unfortunate dead-end of this type of thought experiment. Although, I otherwise applaud its <i>focus</i> on interesting phenomenon. Because in many ways the ~premise is likely true: we can feed, cloth and shelter the world with only a small subset of working primates doing the &quot;work&quot;.  What we can&#x27;t do...is give everyone the best house in the neighborhood, the choicest cuts of meats, and the most attractive partners. But that latter bit of ~scarcity is true...logically.  Empirically it is an observation independent of the the proposed explanatory variable (economic system X^). Its not the x^, but the physics of life that creates scarcity. At least when sociological factors are considered.[1]<p>Edit: [1] See, for example, the notion of &#x27;hedonic adaptation&#x27;.<p>Evidence of this also exists as ~shadow &#x27;fairness&#x27; principles, in non-human primates, and also observable in domesticated canines.",1392375209

This leads to a lack of will from the citizens to cooperate with the police, also in situations where it would be in everyone&#x27;s interest to cooperate with the police.<p>In my country, you have to go through a 3-year training program in order to become a police officer, and these principles are underscored time and time again in training. As a result, most people do in fact trust and respect the police. This makes the job of the police much easier, which in turn leads to a safer society. You never hear normal people say &quot;don&#x27;t talk to the police&quot;, which is something that seems really weird when reading about the US.

7237896,comment,7237713,7237713,1,0,edem,,,"Let me tell you what was I thinking when I finished reading your post. I came up with a little story to demonstrate my opinion about it: So you grab your fine apple juice which you drink every day. The  sourness pampers your palates. Then someone comes and gives you a pomegranate. He says &quot;This is the finest fruit I&#x27;ve eaten so far!&quot;. You take a bite out of it and spit it out saying &quot;This is awful! Apple juice is much better! Quit bothering me with your stupid ideas!&quot;. The guy leaves with an uneasy expression on his face while you drop the pomegranate and never eat it again. Unluckily you never learn how savory the pomegranate is.<p>So first no one should tell you that Angular is better than jQuery since they have different purposes. Angular is an MVW framework while jQuery is a javascipt library. Another thing is you think something sucks back it up with data. I see no concrete examples just some guesswork. And lastly: I can bet that if you try to read through SICP you&#x27;ll say that LISP is crap and useless because it does not look like jQuery. If you don&#x27;t take the time to understand something properly you&#x27;ll never learn anything new.

Once you start down a path of mass incarceration, there&#x27;s pressure to find a profitable use for prisoners.  Once you have a profit-making use, there&#x27;s a demand for more prisoners.

Suppose instead of screaming at someone the individual went up to the home of a black family and burned a cross on their sidewalk (so no tresspassing) at 2am, and left a piece of cardboard on their door saying &quot;Watch out.  We are coming for you!&quot;  That&#x27;s a pretty classic terroristic threat in US history.  It may consist <i>entirely</i> of expressive acts and no real property crime.  Certainly that&#x27;s worthy of significant punishment.<p>Now this case doesn&#x27;t even come close to that hypothetical and I think the differences are illustrative.  It isn&#x27;t specific.  It isn&#x27;t a threat directed at the target.  It isn&#x27;t disruptive by itself.  So if the individual isn&#x27;t taking any steps to make it happen, I think it really should fall in the category protected by Brandenburg v. Ohio.   Indeed, if you read footnote 1 of that case, you will see that the speech at issue here was a lot less likely to cause imminent lawless action, was a lot less terroristic, and was a lot less credible than the speech found protected in that case.",1392374292

Someone else comes along and proposes a related scheme based on Hard Problem Y which, having more structure, allows for either smaller keys or faster computation.<p>3.

Many variants based on alternative codes, attempting to reduce the public key size, have been proposed over the years, and very few have survived. Another example is elliptic curves: early on speed was an issue for their practicality, so many weak curves were also proposed that tried to speed things up (one particular example was Koblitz&#x27;s supersingular curve that rendered point doubling into a linear operation).<p>Ideal lattices have exacerbated this phenomena by its applications. Lattices are a key tool in fully homomorphic encryption and friends (multilinear maps, now also obfuscation), and in the frenzy to get these applications into practicality ideal lattices (as opposed to unstructured ones) seem to be the fastest shortcut into better speed and size.

If you have 100 pages with simple text and images on it, the task is not complex. Just time consuming. So I consider that a complexity of 1, times 100 times. So, complexity is 100.<p>If you have one page with one complex interactive form, with a calculator, that grabs prices from out there on The Web, then it’s a one page design, but complexity of that one page is way high, depending on all of the features on it. Calculator, 2 points. Search 3 points. Connecting to databases and APIs, 5 points. You get the idea.<p>Both projects can be about 100 points. One more complex than the other, and one more pages than the other. And now for the prices:<p>$125 – $250 per point.<p>That’s it. Why the wide range? Depends on a lot of things.

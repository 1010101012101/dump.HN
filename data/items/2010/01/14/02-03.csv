While 1 day's wages of a median Mexican assembly worker is less than 1 hour of a median domestic US assembly worker's wages; 1 day's wages of a median Chinese assembly worker is cheaper than 1 hour of the media Mexican worker.<p>There were some articles last year (or maybe it was 2008) about textile manufacturing in the US, and how the Chinese were subsidizing them to the point where even if the US workers worked for free, the US plants could not compete on price.<p>To understand how much manufacturing changed, I recommend reading The Box. The shipping container totally changed everything by reducing shipping costs by about 98%. A lot of cities that used to be manufacturing centers (such as NYC and Detroit) withered, and a lot of cities that used to be shipping centers (such as NYC and London) also shriveled up because they could not support container traffic.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Box-Shipping-Container-Smaller-Economy/dp/0691136408/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Box-Shipping-Container-Smaller-Economy...</a>",1263437589

Does this clause prevent me from pursuing my own ventures during this time?  Is everything I do during this time claimable by them?<p><i>rising out of, or in connection with, performing the Services</i><p>This bit seems to limit it to whatever I happen to be doing for them, but as this story, currently on the front page of HN shows, even lawyers have difficulty nailing it all down.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1050952"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1050952</a><p>For example, if I come up with some clever little bit of javascript that does something interesting, does it mean I can never use that for any purpose ever again?  It's terribly ambiguous and limiting.  I don't expect to take the job because I am currently working on my own projects and have no concrete way of defending myself against them claiming all of my work.<p>The second problem I have is this phrase:<p><i>Consultant also agrees to promptly make full written disclosure to the Company of any Inventions...</i><p>WTF does that mean? Even if it is limited to the ""inventions"" I ""invent"" for them, does that mean I'm supposed to immediately write some kind of disclosure after I ""invent"" something and give it to them?  It's ridiculous.  Let's assume this refers to my existing ""inventions"", not developed during the contract term, which I don't think it does.  In that case, how could I possibly expect to protect myself?  What if I forget to list one of my ""inventions"".  They can claim it?  I honestly don't think all of the doubt is even worth the time and effort to nail it all down.<p>I should pay a lawyer to go over it, but I already know I will require some lines to be removed, which will probably negate their interest in hiring me and thus make paying a lawyer a complete waste of money.<p>I understand the motivations for these kinds of contracts, but it puts all of the burden on the consultant and gives the overall impression that they can bend you over on a whim and screw you royally.  It's basically making me not interested in the job, especially since I have my own things I want to work on. Initially, I recognized that my particular skills were exactly what they needed and it would be a pleasant job, but the ""pleasant"" part is quickly disappearing.<p>I'm probably just too uptight about this kind of stuff.",1263437383

That's a gap of $4.7 billion.  That's a lot.<p>Do you think the amount of money the state receives indirectly from tech companies run by Americans educated in out-of-state colleges exceeds this amount?  The figures for this are much harder to come by, but I suspect that the state makes back at least a same-order-of-magnitude amount of what it pays out.<p>According to wikipedia, there were 386,000 tech workers in the Bay Area in '08.  If we assume that half of them are Americans from out of state, then they'd have to pay about $5000 in taxes a year to make it worth it, assuming that there's also a multiplier of 4 due to workers in other industries being hired to serve them.<p>Of course, all this assumes we're running on a ""we pay you taxes in exchange for your nerds"" model, and it may be more complicated than that.",1263436896

I've got some mod_security rules + a script that combs logs and passes the IP to an iptables script to block them. Are you familiar with mod_security? The default rules are a little too aggressive for my liking, but it's a really fantastic tool.<p>Adding a CAPTCHA to all forms would be an easy solution, but it's just not practical on many of our forms. I've had a good deal of success adding a hidden form field (that is, one that's set to display:none by a CSS rule) and then ensuring that it hasn't been tampered with when the form is submitted.<p>The gibberish is typically random letters and numbers, but it's smart enough to fill all numbers in fields expecting phone numbers and email addresses in fields expecting emails.<p>The scale of the operation is daunting, though. My script is pretty conservative (I really don't want to block legit usrs) and it still picks up a few hundred new IP addresses every day. I expire the bans after a week or the list would get unmanagable.<p>And dealing with Google is very frustrating. Google says they've already detected all fraudulent clicks and credited us.

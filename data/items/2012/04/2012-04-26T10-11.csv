3893184,comment,3893103,3893152,3,0,drostie,,,"At simulating the quantum mechanics of simple 2D spin systems, from what I gather from the Nature article.<p>The press release sounds like they've developed a quantum computer, but this is not borne out by that article. While there is lots of promising work in quantum computing as a whole, this as I understand it can't be used for that, because you can't tune the qubit interactions individually but you can only tell the whole lot to do the same thing. (At least, the abstract doesn't seem to discuss anything more complicated than giving them all a ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic coupling.)<p>If that's correct, then this article seems overstated. At the very least, I know there are now ""optical lattices"" of qubits made from atoms supercooled into a Bose-Einstein condensate and then relaxed into a very pure square lattice. You don't have to know what that means, just know that with some method which is now reasonably well known, you can get much much more than 300 atoms interacting via quantum mechanics. Like, optical lattices get hundreds of thousands, if my memory serves me correctly. So this isn't, like, the biggest entangled system ever demonstrated of this form -- not by far. It <i>might</i> be the biggest which has this level of tunable Ising interaction, that I don't know. But there are now tons of approaches to quantum computing, and yes, some of them can throw much larger numbers at the problem than just 300.<p>The very nice thing here seems to be the quantum entanglements getting done over a spacing of 30 microns. That might not mean much to you, but the optical lattice work is done at tiny spacings, and it becomes extremely difficult to do any sort of individual readout. 30 microns means that you have a lot of leverage to address individual atoms. If you could get them all to entangle with each other and then you could manipulate them individually with some gates, you might be able to get some good quantum error correction set up.<p>That probably also doesn't mean anything to you. The important fact about quantum error correction is this: once your QEC is reliably set up, you have passed the critical barrier and you can scale up arbitrarily to a quantum computer by just throwing more atoms at the problem.",1335435815

The Linux USB debug stuff works well for this, I've had less luck on Windows.<p>- using a virtual machine and forwarding it the USB device. I've had success with this for intercepting the USB traffic for a device with only proprietary Windows drivers, but where snooping in Windows directly failed. Boot up in Linux, set up a Windows virtual machine, forward the USB device to the VM, install the Windows drivers in the VM and use Linux' USB debug interface.<p>- Hardware USB snooping devices. You physically insert them between your USB device and the PC, and they log the data flowing through. Obviously, this is a bit more expensive, but will basically always work.",1335435484

3893146,comment,3892508,3892508,1,0,drostie,,,"I have two related ideas for a useless language, this is very close to the first one.<p>The first idea is that you normally use at least 2 symbols for a programming language, but you can in principle get away with just one. The ""vanilla"" form of this idea is to use the length of the processed string as the instruction itself -- that is, it has a bit pattern which gives you two symbols to play with in principle. Of course that's pretty ugly so you can instead do something slightly more ""advanced"" and use a non-character as a delimiter; the most obvious choice is file boundaries on a filesystem, but in principle any data structure boundary can be used.<p>The second useless language that I want to create is one which I'm not even completely sure works. The idea is that you have some number of nodes -- let's say 256 -- which each contain some number of bytes -- let's say 4. Those bytes represent two (node pointer, instruction) tuples. These get initialized to a definite 1KB prelude, and the computer starts at node 0. The instructions can also manipulate registers and a much larger memory space, and can load ints from that memory into other nodes, but the 1 KB is needed for the interpreter.<p>The idea for this useless language is that, the computer chooses one of the two tuples randomly, performs its instruction, and then goes to the node it points to. >:D<p>The basic idea is that all esoteric languages seem to be about ""how do you program familiar thing X if you don't have Y?"", but I have 256 instructions so I'll give you all sorts of wonderful functions to call on your registers. The problem is really just that the computer does not natively want to follow a deterministic path, and you have to ""herd it"" into that mentality.",1335434491

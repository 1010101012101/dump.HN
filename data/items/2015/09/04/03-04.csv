You&#x27;re not even half done.<p>I see nothing but good advice so far -- challenge, exercise, lighten up on yourself.  However, I&#x27;ll offer up something completely different...  allocate a chunk of your time to helping others.  Focus on their problems and challenges (not yours) and use your skills and background to help them improve their situation.  It is incredibly rewarding to look back and see how your actions have materially helped the lives of others.  Churches, other non-profits, Big Brothers, community groups, etc. are often starving for skilled volunteers like yourself.  And hey, while you are busy helping others, you might bump into a nice lady.  It&#x27;s a great way for them to see you for who you really are, not just what you look like on the outside.<p>BTW, I just watched Unbroken tonight for the first time.  What an awesome story.  The number and magnitude of the challenges that this guy went through were staggering -- and he never gave up.  The challenges just made him redouble his efforts.  Get some inspiring things to watch and read.<p>Friends?  Get some quality ones.  If you have any toxic friends, dump them.  If a good group of friends doesn&#x27;t happen by accident, you should consciously cultivate one.  You need a group of friends that will support and encourage you, and it&#x27;s your duty to do the same for them.",1441338274

10168713,comment,10166228,10168511,0,0,dahart,,,"Everything you said is right. I&#x27;m going to totally geek out here, so forgive me. I don&#x27;t intend to argue with you at all, just clarifying my own thoughts and explanation.<p>I would call the back and forth &quot;balancing&quot;, and not counter-steering. You go back and forth in order to keep your center of mass positioned, on average, over the line that connects your two contact points with the ground. But I think you&#x27;re continually counter-steering while you balance! (Unless you are leaning really fast back and forth, but that&#x27;s not how we ride bikes, right? We steer to balance...)<p>Counter-steering (in my mind- this is not necessarily generally accepted) is always an instantaneous effect where you steer the front wheel to the left of where it is, in order to turn more right than you&#x27;re currently turning. I <i>think</i> that you are always counter-steering, even on a bicycle.<p>My theory is that if you put any inline two wheel vehicle, regardless of motor or mass, into a constant speed, constant radius right turn, then the stationary position will be the front wheel is steering to the right a bit. Now is where counter-steering comes in. In order to increase your turning radius, or straighten out and stop turning, you steer into the turn by pushing forward on the left side of the handlebars. In order to decrease your turning radius, or turn tighter, you push on the right side of the handlebars, thus steering the wheel more left than it currently is. For this second part, your front wheel might be steering right of center the entire time, the critical bit is that you&#x27;re steering left of where you were in order to tighten your right turn.<p>I think counter-steering is going on at all times, even while you&#x27;re swinging back and forth balancing on a bike. In fact on a bike its a lot easier to experience counter-steering when you&#x27;re coming out of a turn than when you&#x27;re going into one. I think this is what people mistake for steering right to turn right. You do steer right, but it happens after the turn started, you always turn into the turn in order to straighten out. It just happens so quickly and automatically its hard to notice its there.<p>What do you think, sound plausible? The implications of this would mean that mass & gyroscopic effects don&#x27;t have much to say about counter-steering specifically, they just change how much you can turn by leaning vs turn by counter-steering. With bigger bikes, you can&#x27;t do much by leaning. (I think I&#x27;m just repeating what you said here.) But I also think we use a lot more counter-steer than lean on bicycles, and just don&#x27;t know it!",1441337907

If you&#x27;re bored at work, do something else that will excite you. 29 is young. If anyone in SV tells you otherwise, they&#x27;re delusional. Nearly all of the most famous entrepreneurs in SV&#x27;s history were in their mid 30&#x27;s when they got their big hit. At 29 there is still a lot of great work / productivity to be had, decades worth in fact.<p>2) Work out, weight lifting specifically. Put on 20 pounds of muscle. It&#x27;s an excellent way to boost energy, feel better mentally about yourself, and to get the attention of the opposite sex. You can get most of the way there in a single year with discipline. Getting fit is also one of the best ways to beat normal feelings of depression.<p>3) Shave your head. Combine that with adding muscle. As a combination it tends to go over well with a lot of women.<p>People your age do not smash left and right. Most people don&#x27;t have much going for them at 29, either in the US, the bay area, or the world.

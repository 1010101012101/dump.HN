Very smart people have been pointing out for years that our current security apparatus makes no sense, but it's still political suicide for any politician to admit this obvious fact. Instead we get non-sensical additions to an already silly system every time someone like the underwear bomber gets through.<p>What's the answer? Perhaps it's just the conventional wisdom that Americans can't be treated as adults and told the truth about the true costs of absolute security (an impossibility). I would like to see a politician brave enough to say that, though I fear that the conventional wisdom is correct and such talk is impossible for a candidate wishing election.",1263020332

1041138,comment,1040307,1040307,0,0,gruseom,,,"Off topic, but the title derives from a favorite line by T.S. Eliot. I'd always heard it quoted as ""Good poets borrow, great poets steal."" After a bit of Googling, though, it turns out that the actual line is ""Immature poets imitate, mature poets steal."" That's less punchy; I prefer the bastardized version. It's an interesting example of how evolution can strengthen and polish an original phrase. Who knows how many versions (and minds) it passed through before ending up with that perfect rhythm.<p>Still, the full quote more than makes up for it with the context, which is magnificent. Check this out:<p><i>One of the surest of tests is the way in which a poet borrows. Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different. The good poet welds his theft into a whole of feeling which is unique, utterly different from that from which it was torn; the bad poet throws it into something which has no cohesion. A good poet will usually borrow from authors remote in time, or alien in language, or diverse in interest. Chapman borrowed from Seneca; Shakespeare and Webster from Montaigne. The two great followers of Shakespeare, Webster and Tourneur, in their mature work do not borrow from him; he is too close to them to be of use to them in this way.</i>",1263019103

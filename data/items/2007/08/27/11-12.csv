Smart entrepreneurs focus on the very essence of why the problem exists and the pain it causes. Then, when they find a solution that works, they know how valuable the solution really is.",1188214594

I hadn't read BoingBoing much before that, and now I'm a rapid fan. <p>I think the discussion with Luddites was fairly useless. It shows a fair amount of due diligence, where dissenting voices are given a podium far larger than the they ""deserve"" given the popularity of their opinions. I did enjoy that the Luddite gave a talk through teleconference.<p>The format last year was pretty bad at times. The Open-Mic questions wasted lots of time. Written questions were submitted but not used. There were no break-off sessions.<p>Also, the moderator, Peter Thiel, is as boring as watching paint dry, and didn't actually do any reasonable moderation of the discussion. ",1188214353

I\nnoticed that the service you mentioned [remote control mail#] only scans the outside of the mail (probably the envelope) and then when you receive a\nnotification, you have to tell them to open it and scan it. That's\nkind of lame, but they're probably still buying mail scanning\nequipment and can't handle all of the volume yet.<p>I also use MyEZBills for the scanning of all my bills. They receive\nthe bills, scan them, notify you when they arrive, use OCR to\ndetermine the amounts and dates due. You can also set up automatic payments to pay fixed amounts or the minimum balance due.<p># <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/22/remote-control-mail-check-your-postal-mail-on-the-web/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/22/remote-control-mail-che...</a>",1188213441

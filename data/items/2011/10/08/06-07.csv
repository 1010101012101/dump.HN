The paradigm shift happened almost immediately. 50 years ago you would only work out if you were an athlete or a soldier. A value was placed on wellness much like a value will eventually be placed on education. Also watching parents sit in unemployment lines because the factory closed is serving as a wakeup call to many people. Don't overestimate the Asians either -- their concept of education is quantitative (i.e how high we're your scores or how many vocabulary words did you learn) while Americans tend to be more qualitative. There's a reason innovation in places like China depends on copying everyone else. What major startups in China have been built based on an original idea? Very very few. There are more successful startups based on new ideas in the Bay Area than in the entirety of China. The successful Chinese companies are almost always rehashed versions of American products.

Stallman's ideas were born at the time when absolute majority of computer users were also IT guys and in that context they do make sense. However nowadays computers are just mere tools/entertainment machines for the most of the users. The only concern they have is ""does it work"", not ""can I modify the program"".

Good luck with it.<p>Oh and a friend of mine were just talking to me about ideas on shared photos some days ago. I think you should think if you have not already did it, about very interactive stuff on photos like deformation, alien head transformation, mini games... I'm not expert, my friend is. People really like to share photos. Good luck again.<p>Oh and, the ""photo-blog your life"" works well to me. =)",1318053805

See [2] for browser-specific hacks.<p>Summary: most modern browsers including IE9 support RFC2231/5987. (Edit: see my other comment in this thread for IE6-8.)<p>Another option is to leave out the troublesome ""filename"" parameter altogether and use the last part of the URL to convey the same information, e.g. /files/uploads/2013/<file_id>/filename.ext. After all, most browsers already understand how percent-encoding works in the URL. With today's URL rewriting engines, this shouldn't be too difficult to achieve regardless of how your files are actually organized on disk or which language you use to perform access control. It would be as if the client were requesting a static file.<p>[1] <a href=""http://greenbytes.de/tech/tc2231/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://greenbytes.de/tech/tc2231/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7967079/special-characters-in-content-disposition-filename"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7967079/special-character...</a>",1366729194

5595493,comment,5594403,5595375,12,0,rst,,,"The video actually shows two stages and the Dragon capsule, which is payload.  As to the use of staging, there are several reasons:<p>1) During the late stages of the boost, the one second stage engine is pushing only its single engine, fuel and tankage. You're no longer dragging around the nine engines of the first stage and their tanks.  That weight saving means you get a lot more delta-V for each unit of expended fuel.<p>2) The engines themselves are also different.  Rocket nozzles designed for optimal performance at sea level aren't optimal for high-altitude or vacuum conditions; those optimal for vacuum won't work at sea level (their exit pressure is so low that the exhaust has trouble pushing air out of the way).  And compromise designs aren't optimal in either environment.<p>3) In the proposed SpaceX reuse architecture, they don't need to protect that long, thin first-stage tank from re-entry at orbital velocity.  It's not clear how they could.",1366729151

Heck, following your line of reasoning to its logical conclusion, why don't we just stop funding education altogether?<p>There is the saying that the US has the world's 50 best universities --- but also the 5,000 worst. While this is an exaggeration, there is quite some truth in it. Just to reiterate my point: if you, as a foreigner, address a bus driver in Oslo in English, he will quite possibly reply in proper English. However, talk to a shopping clerk at Sainsbury's in England, or Target in the US, and you may have to concede that the language they speak is closer to pidgin than English.<p>Lastly, I'll let you know that I have attended graduate school at a top UK university, a place you have heard of. Interestingly enough, only about a quarter of the grad students were British, and according to the rector this was because many British schools and universities don't educate their students properly. Now you may also know that the UK school system does quite a good job separating the children of the plebs from the children of the rich.<p>Can you see what  I'm getting at? Well, I'll just spell it out for you: a very large part of my fellow students in graduate school earned their undergraduate degree from public universities in Europe, which normally implied the complete absence of tuition fees. Yet, for some reason Britain's own talent found it difficult to compete with them. This mirrors the point another commenter has already made regarding the situation in the US, but since you're from Europe, I thought you might appreciate this perspective.",1366728923

5595453,comment,5594053,5594253,5,0,T-hawk,,,"I'll give a dissenting opinion.  I've loved the Comedy Central reboot.  The material is quick and snappy in a way that the earlier seasons weren't, packing in rapid-fire jokes.  And it still consistently throws in bits of real science and mathematics, like the famous brain-swapping problem and solution.  The movies were uneven, but season six hit a new and sustained peak starting with the fourth episode.<p>I often felt like the earlier seasons got too caught up in their own worldbuilding and forgot the funny.  ""The Why of Fry"" was my personal least favorite, retconning the entire premise of the show and Nibbler's nature, and straining on a single joke of Fry's stupidity for the entire episode.  Other low points included the forced Amy-Kif relationship that had little comedy content and less meaning, Leela's retconned family, and any time filled by Zapp Brannigan's one-note attempts at jokes.  Futurama can't credibly do gross-out or shock humor in a world where Family Guy cranks it up to eleven every week.<p>Futurama is best as a joke turbine playing off the future setting, and IMO strains for misguided impact whenever it brings up how Fry's family lost a son.  I never bought in to the heartstring-tugging.  The characters are too broadly drawn and fantastical to care about, unlike the Simpsons.  The Comedy Central seasons seem to have figured this out, realizing that it's too late in the game for any more meaningful character material.  Instead, the show has seriously stressed the pacing and density of the comedy, which for me really shines now.",1366728836

Work is important, but family is essential.<p>Speaking personally (I am a VP of Engineering at a startup and a father of three), when I have needed to forgo a work commitment for a family one, I have enjoyed nothing but support from my CEO.  He's a generation older than I am (his kids are young adults), and he is surprisingly blunt about wishing he had made different choices when they were younger.  He knows that I work my tail off -- but he also knows the importance of making the right decisions at the right moment.

For those, here is a copy:<p>----<p>TL;DR: Schools were closed in a Dutch city yesterday because of a message on 4Chan. Nothing actually happened.<p>A message was posted on 4Chan two days ago, stating that a person was going to kill his teacher and as many others as possible on a school in Leiden. The Zrich police found this in a regular scan and contacted the Dutch authorities. The message also said that he or she would be carrying a note which was to be publicized. If not, a friend of his would do so on the internet that afternoon. This note was what convinced that the police that it was a real threat; it was something a real killer might think about.<p>After some deliberation, the major of Leiden decided together with the police that schools should be closed yesterday. Both Zrich and the Dutch authorities seem to have failed to notice that this was 4Chan they were talking about, and the website even carries the headline:
<i>""The stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood. Only a fool would take anything posted here as fact.""</i><p>One of the biggest Dutch news websites (nu.nl) now reports that 4Chan is calling the would-be killer's post a ""work of art"", without naming sources. The translation of 4Chan's publication, according to nu.nl, fits the headline exactly, and they even cite a part of the sentence. They seem to have completely missed the point that this message has been on the website for months ifnot years.<p>Anyway, the schools posted on their websites that they would be closed that day and also e-mailed the students. Most got the message, either via social media or from the e-mail directly, and those who came to school were told by personnel what was going on. Besides those, the only people roaming the place were media and police with bulletproof vests.<p>I don't know what you'd do if you were expecting someone with a gun to come to school, but I wouldn't close the place, tell everyone, and hope for him to come anyway. You might as well post a tweet asking him to turn himself in.<p>Later that day another kid actually tweeted that he was heading over to Leiden ""right now"" and was going to shoot a teacher. This made national news as well, but a few hours later he tweeted in full caps that it was a joke and that he was sorry.<p>A little while after that a suspect was arrested. He used an ""open proxy"", but with the help of the FBI they managed to find the person. He was suspended from a nearby school since late 2011 because of his behavior. Upon searching no firearms were actually found.<p>Today schools opened again and police remains on guard incase the current suspect turns out to be not to be the perpetrator.

Therefore I do not start writing C++ templates until after I already have a specific problem, and a pretty detailed layout of how I want my data to be laid out in memory.  The details of how my code gets laid out in memory I gladly leave to the compiler.  But it is important for me to know that I can use templates and I <i>won't have to</i> worry about it either.<p><i>I suspect that your first line of defense against running out of memory was not looking template construction, but compiler optimizations. Managing memory manually in C++ is hard enough without creating a mindset which encourages premature optimization.</i><p>Not true!<p>In the latest project that this came up in, one of the first templates that I wrote in C++ allows me to replace things that can go into a std::map with 4-byte objects that are simply indexes into a deduped vector.  (This is on Linux, so I don't have to worry about dword alignment.  Thus 4-byte objects only take 4 bytes.)  Given that I have a very large number of these, often need to compare two to know if they are the same or different, and only seldom need to get at the actual value, this gives huge memory and performance benefits.<p>Of course doing this kind of thing for a general-purpose application would be horribly premature optimization.  Which is why I only considered going to C++ after analyzing where the issues were in my first two Perl versions.<p>And I am an example showing that it isn't just C++ gurus who find themselves needing to write performance critical code in C++.  In fact my desire to avoid premature optimization means that when I do need to write performance critical code in C++, I do not know the language very well because I use it so seldom!",1366727599

If you can reduce operational turnaround time and operational complexity, even at a cost of payload, then you'll save so much money it'll be worth it in the long term. SpaceX is aiming for a re-assemble, gas up and go workflow. If they can pull it off it might reduce their per flight launch costs by a factor of 10 in the short term and perhaps as much as 100 if they get really good at it (although that's likely several generations of hardware down the line, at best). With that sort of thing on offer a reduction in payload is easily justifiable.<p>Imagine if somebody replaced your car with a version that had twice the carrying capacity, but would only run for one tank of gas.

His claims is that the companies who think they can create jobs with more money, exist out there and he want the find a mechanism to find them instead of simply distributing at large across the system and see what happens.<p>Third the US is probably the best country in the world to be an entrepreneur and business. There is very little in the way for anyone to find a need and then go out and build a business around it and there is a huge market for that. If your claim is that it can only be solved by making that part easier then the entire premise of capitalism seems flawed (I don't believe it is and I am not saying you are claiming that either)<p>The problem fundamentally is that you can only adjust your metrics so far before they become meaningless.<p>The first step to get the US out of their debt is to raise taxes. That won't make the startup environment better but it will start showing that the US as a country are ready to pay their bills instead of speculating their way out of it.<p>And before you start calling me a socialist and other nasty things let me just pre-empt this by the following.<p>I live in Denmark, a country with a progressive tax system +55% tax for the highest incomes and a sales tax of 25%. A car here cost 3 times the amount of a car in the US all because of taxes.<p>I am a member of the only liberal (in the european sense) political party and is fighting to get lower taxes.<p>So I am not saying raise taxes lightly. I am simply saying that the US have reached a point where the low tax is working against them not for them.<p>All systems have thresholds especially economic ones. To keep wanting more of the same ends up creating a self sustaining effect after you reach a certain point. The US have reached that now.",1313045795

It's the usual patent troll BS, but there's one thing that really stuck out to me on their blog:<p><i>The radio stations we all enjoy today were built upon Thomas Jeffersons belief that an invention, properly documented as unique and original, is private property.</i><p>It reminded me of one of my favorite quotes of all time:<p><i>If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.</i><p>TLDR: Thomas Jefferson is a boss, patent trolls are sleazy.<p>Edit: Actually, the other post[0] on the blog is great too. It's a defense of one of their patentsnot really worth reading except the comments, which has several people who had personal experience with prior art years before the patent was issued.

The way that each neuron relates to the others is set, during training, so that when you present a given input to the network, you get something close to the expected output. In a social network, you basically just have a (somehow weighted) graph of people, but you lack the means to ""train"" it.

I want to like it because it seems like a good idea, but then the more I think about it, there doesn't seem to be that much practical use for the service. The way I see this, kids who need phone dialing that simplistic would be too young to use it.<p>I think this would work better as an IM/voice chat program aimed at the 7-11yr old crowd-a way for them to easily chat with other kids, when they happen to be online (and maybe a ""voice mail"" type system), from an approved list of friends their parents have added.<p>Maybe I'm old fashioned, but I don't like the idea of kids and phones - not that talking to Grandma across the country is bad or anything. It's just that I don't think a young child has any business using a phone (voice chat, etc.) without first obtaining permission to do so, even if it's safe. So I would either a: make the call for her or 2: supervise while she dials. I mostly feel this way because kids tend to obsess over things and so a child with free reign over a big yellow ""call"" button would get annoying to others. By the time my kid is old enough to pick up the phone and call someone whenever she wants to (i.e. has a basic understanding of telephone etiquette and respect for others' time), basic phone usage just isn't a challenge at that age.<p>Add to this the fact that your average land-line or cell phone service includes local calling, as well as nationwide long distance at a fixed rate and it makes it hard to justify the cost of buying Bumble credits just for the ease of connectivity.",1313044009

I learned a lot about partaking and consuming thoughtful commentary in a semi-anonymous setting.<p>But you know what? All of that content is still here, in different formats.

I've read the same stuff about lean startups at least 100 times now rehashed in different ways. Even though I've never raised money from a VC before, every time I read something on HN about it, I feel like I've been through the process dozens of times. Every 37signals blog post that gets submitted seems like a rehash of the last one. So most of the submitted content around those topics seem like old-hat.<p>At some point, when you continue to consume the content from the same sources for years on end, you're going to see more repeat episodes and you'll have fewer stimulating moments.

Check out GitHub jobs, StackOverflow jobs, 37signals job board, etc. Get yourself a little bit of exposure via open source contributions, blogging about technical things, Hacker News, etc. and they'll come to you.<p>As for student loans, though startups pay less, they still pay pretty high salaries, especially now when all the companies have cash and competition for talent is insane. As long as you keep living fairly cheaply (which can still be a couple steps up from a dorm, but may involve sharing housing, especially if you end up somewhere expensive like the Bay Area), I'm sure you can get an offer that would allow you to live and pay your loan payments.

To understand this operation, you need to look it up in the spec: <a href=""http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf</a><p>Section 6.5.2.1 ""Array Subscripting"" states in item (2) under ""Semantics"" on page 70:<p><pre><code>  A postx expression followed by an expression in square brackets []
  is a subscripted designation of an element of an array object. The
  denition of the subscript operator [] is that E1[E2] is identical
  to (*((E1)+(E2))). Because of the conversion rules that apply to
  the binary + operator, if E1 is an array object (equivalently, a
  pointer to the initial element of an array object) and E2 is an
  integer, E1[E2] designates the E2-th element of E1 (counting from
  zero).
</code></pre>
In other words:<p><pre><code>  a[5] is equal to (*((a)+(5)))
  5[a] is equal to (*((5)+(a)))
</code></pre>
So what are the rules for E1+E2?  Refer to section 6.5.6 ""Additive Operators"", item (8) under ""Semantics"" on page 83:<p><pre><code>  When an expression that has integer type is added to or subtracted
  from a pointer, the result has the type of the pointer operand. If
  the pointer operand points to an element of an array object, and
  the array is large enough, the result points to an element offset
  from the original element such that the difference of the subscripts
  of the resulting and original array elements equals the integer
  expression. In other words, if the expression P points to the i-th
  element of an array object, the expressions (P)+N (equivalently, 
  N+(P)) and (P)-N (where N has the value n) point to, respectively,
  the i+n-th and in-th elements of the array object, provided they
  exist.
</code></pre>
In other words, if (P)+N is equal to N+(P), you need only substitute ""a"" for ""P"" and ""5"" for ""N"" and that proves a[5] == 5[a].  If I've missed something, corrections are welcomed.",1313042459

I have to periodically stop myself when I'm writing PHP and make sure I'm not falling into bad habits.</i><p>You've got to keep in mind what PHP (currently) stands for: ""PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor"".  Use it for that, and it's great, but try to make it do more and you run into trouble.  IMO, PHP should be used in <i>precisely</i> those situations where nobody gives a shit if the code you write is any good or not, and by my reading, this was a valid point in the article.<p>The way I like to think of it, PHP is like Bash scripting for the web: an indispensable tool that's supported almost everywhere, useful for a quick and dirty (and sure, ugly) drop-in solution, but not a language you should ""seriously develop"" in.  Once a project is complex enough that you need to think about how to organize your PHP files (esp. if it's real back-end PHP, not just HTML pages with functions) or manage dependencies and build processes, you've probably crossed a line and should be considering other solutions.<p>But on the other side of the coin, you shouldn't be thinking ""Rails app"" every time you need to add a hit counter and a ""current time"" display to a static web page, I don't care how much nicer code comes out in Ruby than PHP (and I love Ruby in comparison to PHP)...I'm getting the sense that many people here (nothing that you said, chc, indicates that, but many other comments on this thread seem to) would do <i>exactly</i> that, though, which is disturbing.<p>This might be an unpopular opinion, but I truly believe that once in a while hastily flung together spaghetti code is exactly what's called for in certain situations, and PHP excels at making that very easy to whip together and push out the door.",1313042415

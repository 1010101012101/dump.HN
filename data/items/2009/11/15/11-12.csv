942863,comment,942850,942850,0,0,Tichy,,,"These referral schemes basically consist of selling junk to your friends. If doing that is what you consider prodigal and worth aiming for, I don't know what advice to give you.<p>College: you typically go to college only once. You have the rest of your life to earn money and buy lots of cars. While I don't consider college a strict necessity anymore, I think it can be fun and worthwhile (and it probably costs more than buying two cars btw). Which would you rather have, 4 good, unforgettable years at college or two cars?<p>Younger and younger successful people: sure, it is scary. But they will grow up, too, and on the internet, nobody knows you are a dog. Meaning it is the product or service that counts, not your age. So if you find a spin to make money later on, where is the problem?<p>As a side note, I would not believe everything people tell you at such sales seminars.<p>Edit: they don't mention the ""sell stuff to your friends"" part until you sign up.",1258285950

There are not much opportunities where I live and such pyramid schemes are actually very lucrative. They also gave a blown up figure of Rs 24,00,000 in one year which was presented by a person, from a college which works closely with my own, who had done it in his second year. I was almost compelled to join",1258285927

942856,comment,942808,942847,0,0,geuis,,,"I agree. I haven't been much of a fan of Cappucino since seeing a review at a Google JS meetup several months ago. I have just never been sure what the point of a language written on top of javascript is. The whole point of really knowing not only the core language but also the inconsistencies between IE and the rest of the browsers is that I want to build web apps that perform fast and robustly. Abstracting that away into yet another layer that runs moderately slowly on the 70% of common browsers just means that it runs that much more slowly. To be fair, I give all the credit in the world to the 280 North guys, but charging $15 for access to a beta program for an environment and language that really has no broad adoption is just not worth it.",1258285634

He makes more money than all the youngsters that I know <i>combined</i>.<p>The lucky few that manage to be ahead of the game by the time they're 25 are solidly outnumbered by the number of people that are well of by the time they're 40 or 50.<p>But everybody loves a good story, that's why the media will focus on the 20 somethings.<p>50 year old guy makes a million is not as good a story as 18 year old guy makes a million.",1258285531

942850,story,,,4,14,rick_2047,"Ask HN: Is it necessary to be a child prodigy?",,"To day I visited a so-called seminar (which was more like a sales pitch) of a company. The company provides different online courses. There is an option of doing business with a referral system in it. And as such things turn out, the company now focused completely on the business part. As much as I find it foolish that people are paying money to become a member so they can make members and get money and the other members are also there just to make more members which completely leaves out education part, I noticed something strange there. People have actually made money through this (exploiting the foolishness) and all of them were not above 21 or 22. And that too so much that they could buy two or more cars.That made me wonder how dull a life I am living. I mean I am 18 but there is no chance that I would have that kind of money in 4-5 years if I keep working the same way as I do (which is concentrating on my college). I dont know whats the future of these people but there present is sure glamorous.<p>Now I do not compare things which are not comparable. But this is just sticking in my head. I mean if I look around myself there are dozens of child prodigies around, so much so sometimes I wonder if a person can be successful after the age of 25 or 28. This sometimes scares me.<p>So I as HN, as most of you are people here made there own self,usually from scratch. You made startups, you built your own personality, your own fame. You may not have that much money to start with but surely you got there in time. Is it necessary to be a child prodigy to enjoy the money you earn on your own self or if you want to be your own boss?<p>Disclaimer: This post may feel majorly mismanaged, with ideas and words all over the place, but this is because my mind is still whirling with thoughts.",1258285090

942846,comment,942095,942764,0,0,klipt,,,"I'd say it's still useful to know what confident, outgoing and friendly body language looks like, so you can recognize it in others and yourself. For one thing, it might help you deduce what kinds of actions make people more confident, outgoing and friendly, so you can try doing those things yourself. For another, knowing whether somebody else is confident or not can be important in deciding how to relate to them (you don't want to overwhelm an unconfident person).<p>It's definitely more of a sensory ('input') skill than an active ('output') skill though.",1258284821

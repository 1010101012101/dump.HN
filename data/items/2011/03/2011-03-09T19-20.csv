At moxie-zero time, I can do anything else, but need to take a break from the codebase.<p>Timeline seems to be at somewhere between thirty days and three months, and I'm really curious to hear from other Steves what your personal run-time is.<p>Now, this is hell on a team, and double hell on a company that needs to ship on a regular basis, but I've come up with a few coping techniques that really seem to help:<p>1. Comment copiously the <i>how</i> and <i>why</i> things are written (people can usually figure out the <i>what</i> on their own).  I know that my code is going to get handed off, and I don't want to inspire my successor to commit heinous acts of violence.<p>2. Build small, nearly independent projects that function as building-blocks for bigger systems; e.g., build service-oriented architectures.  You often finish well before the steam runs out, and can then build something technically 'new' on top of what you just finished.<p>3. Develop another valuable skill that allows you to contribute even when you're not writing code.",1299700775

Does that relieve the rest of us of all responsibility for the society we create?<p>I don't believe that playing GTA or watching Saw XVIII is going to make anyone a murderer. That doesn't mean I think we should be racing to the bottom, trying to see how far we can take things.<p>To be clear, I consider these issues ones that people should solve for themselves, not ones for the government to get involved in.

2306114,comment,2305184,2305880,0,0,masklinn,,,"> It seems obvious that Apple's interests don't coincide with fully functional cross platform mobile apps.<p>No, it is not that obvious at all. May I remind you that Apple introduced the iOS SDK, spearheads what is usually recognized as the finest rendering engine out there and built what was the first mobile device actually able to surf the web?<p>And that they have shown no will or wish to backtrack on any of these, doubling down instead?<p>There is something much, much simpler to these issues:<p>1. Jobs's Apple will never again live and die at the whim of a third party. They suffered greatly during the Classic-OSX transition because Apple had lost control of the development platform itself (which was basically owned by Metrowerk and its CodeWarrior)<p>2. Jobs's Apple takes decisions it thinks benefit its customers <i>and its customers are always its users</i>.<p>Now they may be wrong on that, and they may be misguided, but time and time again you can (pretty easily) explain the decisions of Jobs's Apple either as trying to avoid losing their platform to a third party or trying to make their user's experience life better.<p>With web browser they fully control the platform. Hell, they control what can be argued the best web platform available (Google's Chrome is giving them a run for their money, in no small part by building upon their work). They don't fear people using their web browser, they wouldn't have built Canvas if they did (why not leave it out as SVG? Slow, hard to use and not a threat at all), they wouldn't be implementing WebGL, they wouldn't spearheads CSS animations and transitions and all the stuff that can make web applications snazzier and cleaner, they wouldn't have the engine with the best HTML5 support <i>by far</i>.<p>Web stuff is not a threat, because they can have the best, shiniest and most advanced web stuff <i>and they control all of it</i> (number of full rendering engines allowed on iOS devices? one. Nobody else is allowed to ship a JS interpreter, therefore no full-blown web browser can avoid using the Webkit that ships with it and is fully built by Apple).<p>Apple doesn't fundamentally mind or care for cross-platform mobile apps, what they fear is a third party's cross platform toolkit taking preeminence over their own tool and deciding of their platform's future. <i>That</i> is why they banned flash (also, because flash is a piece of shit).<p>> Getting people to build with objective C and native code helps lock in<p>That only works because you assert Apple wants to lock users in.<p>> and ensures that any sales go through their payment platform.<p>Cross-platform tools would have the exact same restriction or face bans. iTunes payment mandate is trivially explained through integration and user-experience (did you know that Apple's subscriptions services makes user information availability to magazines opt-in by the user, whereas just about every other service makes it opt-out if opt-able at all? That's because to Apple the device owner is the customer, to just about every other publisher the magazine is the customer).<p>> If you don't think Apple has been moving in this way (anti-cross platform dev tools, requiring sales to use the iTunes payments) you simply haven't been paying honest attention.<p>Either that, or I have not been wearing hate-shaped glasses.<p>But really, I wonder why I bother with all that typing. I should know by now that HN's view of Apple is the same as /r/tech's: a bashing wankfest.",1299700295

2306110,comment,2305491,2305564,0,0,geebee,,,"The problem is that sub-optimal policies can still work as a good heuristic.  For instance, you might say ""it's so hard to wade through these resumes, I'm just going to toss out everyone who doesn't have a degree in Computer Science from a list of preferred universities, everyone who is unemployed, and everyone whose age doesn't fall between 26 and 35"".<p>This is where ""fairness"", in spite of how hard (and even dangerous) it is to define, does matter, because many people believe that a civilized society has an interest in enforcing some basic standards of fairness.  The goal isn't to make life fair, which is impossible, it's to set a minimum standard.<p>For instance, auto insurance companies used to charge men under 25 more for car insurance than women.  And it was very clear that males were more likely to result in a claim than women in this age group.  However, does using this distinction violate basic standards of fairness?  What if you could make a similar claim for a religious group?  A racial group?  An age group?  People tend to differ on exactly where they draw the line, though almost everyone agrees that the line should be drawn somewhere.<p>Personally, I think that using employment status as a screen  strikes me as unfair on a gut level, but I think it does exceed the basic decency standard.  In other words, I don't think it should illegal, but I definitely don't like it.",1299700251

The first phase, the exciting creative process where the problem is a challenge. The second phase, is when the creativity is done, and now its simply a matter of following through the implementation.<p>I experienced these phases a lot in school, especially in math classes. I was never a homework doer. I'd start, eagerly wanting to do it, but after the first couple of problems I couldn't motivate myself to do the rest. Because I just could not stand the repetition--the same formula over and over with different values. I'd usually do the first problem in a section and call it quits.

I'm not even going to start this discussion but it's a preference thing and to many, using the Mac OS is worth $x more.<p>3) Design - The HP Envy looks nice but it's missing the roundness and sleekness of the unibody MBP.

It's consistently murky and unpalatable to me as a programmer because of it's lack of logic. And as far as pointing out how it works, I'm not happy with the state of affairs. I've simply decided that I'm going to talk frankly about how I understand it. Maybe you guys can straighten me out. I see so much posturing on SEO -- even by the guys who claim to be ""shooting straight"" that it's discouraging.<p>The problem you have is that you are trying to describe a system that has no specification. That is, there is no testable definition of ""best content"" that is repeatable and applicable to all users. After all, this was google's entire schtick -- the reason everybody thought it was cool was because they managed to hack the problem better than anybody else had up until then. But there is no solution. It's not that kind of problem.<p>One of the reasons SEO drives me nuts is that the concepts we are so used to in programming, ""black box"", ""answer"", ""best content"", ""user"", etc -- don't really have firm meanings in the way we would like them to. Yes, it would be awesome if there was a little magic box that told me what to do (or gave me all the answers) but -- and this is important -- even if there was, <i>it wouldn't be a black box</i>. We live in a digital age. Anything that can be put into code is instantly commoditized.<p>There is another assumption here that is equally slippery (aside from the fuzzy nature of all the adjectives and the impossibility of making the system opaque), and that is the idea that somehow one can determine content quality mechanically. That's like saying you can pick the ""best"" painting at an art show by using some kind of hand-held scanner and an image-processing algorithm. Content is about people interacting with people -- it's not deterministic. We are not machines.<p>We keep wanting Search Engines to work like the library: go to the card catalog, pick a topic, find authoritative sources. But they keep working like the dance hall: show up with your best suit, make some friends, and work the crowd, become popular. That's frustrating. But as one SEO expert told me in a recent interview[1], if you don't use social signals (popularity), how else would you do it? This is the way we've been judging content since 3 guys sat around in a cave looking at mammoth drawings.<p>[1](If you have time, you might want to listen to the interview.

At some point I seem to hit a barrier in the middle. This usually only happens on ""hard"" projects and even then I inevitably overcome it eventually, sometimes with pair programming, but it's damn annoying. Having Steve or Chris around would be damn handy.",1299697418

Garbage in, garbage out.<p>Square, having decided they are going to be in the business of reading magnetic stripes, cannot make those magnetic stripes any more secure than they already are (not).

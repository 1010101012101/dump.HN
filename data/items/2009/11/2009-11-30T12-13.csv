The data lost dates back to the 1970s, so it's not obvious what relies on it and what doesn't.<p>I don't think the field of climate science is going to vanish in a puff of logic, the way some of its politicized critics are clearly hoping.  But I do think that we ought to wait for a thorough, open audit, rather than assuming that climate science should continue as before with no changes.",1259585017
967719,comment,967552,967552,0,0,SamAtt,,,"I remain someone who is in the middle about Climate Change because I don't feel I've studied all the factors enough to form a definitive opinion.  But one of the thing that always pushes me towards the skeptics side is the fact that advocates (like this author) seem to simply ignore the skeptic's points.<p>Take his first point where he says ""All things being equal, adding greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere will warm it"".  Look how many times he uses the word ""simple"" in that section to indicate it is just beyond dispute that more CO2 will make the world dramatically hotter.<p>The problem is that very point is one of the largest points of dispute.  Skeptics point to evidence that light absorption follows a logarithmic curve as the substance absorbing the light increases.  Meaning if the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is already high enough to absorb most of the infrared radiation we wouldn't see a dramatic increase by adding more CO2.<p>Now you can obviously debate that point and that's where the debate over Global Warming should come in but the fact that this author chooses to skip it completely and present ""CO2 = linear heating of the climate"" as a given tells me where his bias is.  Since the rest of the article is based on his first point being absolute it comes across as ineffective to  me.",1259584969
967718,comment,967552,967552,0,0,Daniel_Newby,,,"There is no such thing as a greenhouse gas. Greenhouses build up heat because the glass prevents convection.  If you made a car with windows transparent to infrared light, a toddler locked inside would still bake to death on a summer day.<p>If water and CO2 were actually greenhouse gases, it would be almost as hot outdoors on a humid day as inside a sealed greenhouse.  It is vastly cooler outdoors because parcels of the air rise as they become hot, transporting heat towards outer space much faster than radiation can.  As the surface becomes hotter, natural convection speeds up, transporting heat somewhat faster.<p>In all the dispute over AGW, I have not seen a single discussion of the relationship between surface temperature and convective heat transport.  Until I see solid data from detailed meteorological micro-simulations, I will continue to treat the AGW hypotheses as unproven. Show us the steepness of your surface temperature-convective heat power curves!",1259584949

If we posit (1) the existence of his memetic engine, and (2) its apparent propensity to self activate, then a good scientist must ask what results from self activation when a basic subsistence meme is not available or needed. In other words, what is the nature of the memetic engine's idle task (to extend his computer metaphor)? Moreover, what type of memetic idle task might be designed by a community of rational minds whose basic survival needs are being met?<p>We might reasonably predict that the non-subsistence meme pool would fall into a stable pattern that is self-consistent, simply for the sake of having a stable self-consistent framework upon which other social activities can be installed.  I would expect it to look like a typical computer programming framework, with a great deal of intricate structure, much of which is not susceptible to trivial performance analysis.<p>We can even amuse ourselves by looking for other religion-software analogies.

This lets you investigate the sensitivity of your conclusions to your various assumptions.<p>For example, if the conclusions are supported by the cleaned data but not the raw data, you need to worry about whether you have accidently written your conclusions in by hand during the cleaning process. One way to investigate this is to have two cleaning scripts, a lax one that only does no-brainer corrections, and a strict one that makes those delicate judgment calls. Then you can reprocess. If lax cleaning of the data supports your conclusions then they are fairly secure. If this sensitivity analysis reveals that the difference between lax and strict cleaning matters to your conclusions, then you groan, because you have waded into muddy waters and things are much harder than you initially thought. Maybe you have to recruit an assistant to clean the data blind, without knowing what the ""right"" answer is, or maybe you need to go on field trips to do direct checks on instruments.<p>If your research has important and expensive implications for public policy other people will want to do this kind of sensitivity analysis themselves and reach their own conclusions.",1259582683

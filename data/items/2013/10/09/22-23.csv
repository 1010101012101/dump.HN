We match components found in binaries in order to identify unlicensed use of third-party code, as well as security patches.<p>Tools like bindiff have been around for years and take advantage of the fact that compilers don&#x27;t randomize code generation. Instead, the callgraph and control-flow graphs largely reflect the structure of the original source code. Once you have leverage by exact-matching the parts of the binary that are nearly identical, you can build up and down the tree of nodes to find those that have more changes.<p>Crypto backdoors can be unbelievably subtle though. A single branch condition, a bit that is flipped, etc. can all lead to catastrophic failures. For example, a compiler optimization for dead code elimination led to some zeroization of key material being skipped. This kind of thing is extremely difficult to find and requires a careful understanding of the underlying code.<p>I agree with you that most differences can be found, but understanding the ramifications of those differences requires extremely careful analysis.

Science itself is basically a subfield of epistemology and it ties together both WHAT we know and WHY we actually know it instead of simply believe it. Science is dedicated to finding out what reality is (as best as mathematics or other abstract structures can describe it at least) and that sets up a class of rigor for certainty which religion can simply not touch. Also, built into science is a feedback loop that constantly reevaluates what it means to be certain and tries to tie that certainty to the real world through engineering, which, again, religion cannot even begin to attempt.<p>What we call science today is a formalization of what humans have been doing for tens of thousands of years: looking for patterns and relationships in cause and effect. The very act of making the first wheel, paper out of papyrus thousands of years before the lumber industry, or a calendar by looking at the stars is an act of scientific exploration that probes not just the natural world, but how we discover what the natural world really is. Over time that methodology has included into our cultural knowledge things like gravity and horticulture while excluding things like rain dances and homeopathic medicine.<p>In the end, you either accept the rigor and structure on knowledge and certainty developed by science and the scientific method (which, by the way, created modern civilization as you see it today) or you don&#x27;t. If you accept it, religion by its very definition (supernatural and all that) conflicts with science. If you don&#x27;t, then there is a basic difference in core assumptions and there really is no argument.",1381358748

What you are calling &quot;rights&quot; is properly qualified as &quot;legal rights&quot;.  I am not suggesting there are legal rights in the state of nature, I am just pointing out that there is an entirely different category of rights and that &quot;rights&quot; refers to both categories.  This other category of rights, which I&#x27;ll call natural/human rights, corresponds to morals, whereas the legal rights category corresponds to laws.  Typically laws and thus legal rights have some basis in agreed upon natural/human rights.  See Wikipedia, which also lumps human rights in with natural rights:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights</a><p>Since I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ve encountered the terms natural rights and human rights before, and that you understand that they specify morals without being legal rights, and that we don&#x27;t basically disagree about how things work, nor do we even disagree philosophically on a wide variety of issues (perhaps importantly that moral absolutism is terrible), I was more curious about whether you think world federalism is a good idea...",1381358211

6524288,comment,6522901,6523582,10,0,vidarh,,,"If meditation does not make it easier for you to focus, you will be unable to progress with your meditation. It&#x27;s that simple - increasing your focus is integral to progress in meditation practice.<p>Meditation consists of two main &quot;directions&quot;: Concentration practice and contemplation practices. Most schools of meditation has one of these as their main focus, but contemplation practice includes certain levels of concentration practice as pre-requisite, either explicitly (separate ways to train your concentration), or indirectly as part of practising a form of contemplative meditation.<p>Concentration practice is generally what you might think of if you think of meditation as emptying your mind, repeating mantras or similar.<p>Try this simple exercise:<p>Set an alarm for five minutes.<p>Sit comfortably. Floor is traditional, but not at all necessary; a position that is comfortable enough that physical discomfort does not distract you too much is much more important. Half close your eyes (you can meditate with your eyes fully open, or fully closed, or anything in between - it is a matter of preference, but until you know consider that fully open means your eyes will be dry and there will be more distraction, and fully closed increases your chance of falling asleep).<p>Then breathe in and out through your nostrils. Count 1, 2, 1, 2, 1,2 as you breathe in and out.<p>Every time you notice that you have stopped counting, try to estimate (quickly) how long you have been &quot;off track&quot;, and start again, until the alarm goes off.<p>Congratulations, you have just meditated. If you can make the whole five minutes, try it again but without counting, just noticing the breath.<p>Most first timers/beginners are lucky if they manage 30 seconds consecutively without going off track, often for minutes at a time. If you manage the full five minutes without finding yourself thinking about something completely difference, your concentration skills are already well above average. With practice, you can keep attention like that for hours. And it does translate to being able to keep focus in other situations.<p>If you want to try more, &quot;Mindfulness in Plain English&quot; is a good introduction: <a href=""http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html</a> ; the html version is free. Gil Fronsdals &quot;Introduction to Meditation&quot; series of recordings are also great, free, and includes guided meditations that are quite useful to beginners: <a href=""http://www.audiodharma.org/series/1/talk/1762/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.audiodharma.org/series/1/talk/1762/</a><p>These focus on vipassana - insight meditation or mindfulness. This is a contemplation practice, but the introductions above spend a substantial part on the basic concentration practice of meditating on the breath, which is a common concentration practice in many schools of meditation.<p>The &quot;mindfulness&quot; part is sort of in the gaps: Rather than trying to hold an &quot;iron grip&quot; on your mind to focus on the breath, the purpose is closer to &quot;catching you thinking&quot; (or feeling, or sensing, etc.) and paying attention to the sensations an quality of what arises in you, while you try not to get pulled away from paying attention to the breath, and then rather than forcing the thought away, to let it &quot;fade&quot; by &quot;simply&quot; (it is by no means simple) not follow the thought with another.<p>Both of these introductions are of buddhist origins, though if it matters to you one of the things that appealed greatly to me about them is that they are careful to keep the material mostly secular (there&#x27;s some brief mentions of buddhist faith, but they are explanatory rather than essential toe the meditation practice).",1381357425

To this day, it describes accurately what is going on with any kind of adaptive system, not only in biology but also computer science and information theory, and one could make some convincing arguments for physics as well.<p><i>> Genetics, biochemistry and ethology are light years beyond Darwin.</i><p>It&#x27;s true that Darwin didn&#x27;t necessarily know much about the inner workings of what he was observing. All he could do is make the actual observations, and reason about them. This led to a key idea about how organisms develop, and it is this idea that became part of the basic tool set of any scientist, it&#x27;s right up there with Pythagoras and Newton. Genetic and biochemical research didn&#x27;t really exist in Darwin&#x27;s time, but the principles he described are found everywhere you look in these fields. And if it hadn&#x27;t been for Darwin, someone else would have found this out, it became gradually more inescapable the more data we gathered. In fact, today it wouldn&#x27;t be called much of an achievement at all, since the mechanism is so obvious and ubiquitous whenever you look at bio data.<p><i>> - God could use evolution as a tool. And God could also create Earth with all those fossils underground just for a joke.</i><p>Those two are actually somewhat mutually exclusive. Either you believe that some kind of deity &quot;uses&quot; evolution as a tool, at which point people should ask themselves what the point of having gods is if they&#x27;re not actually doing anything measurable at all.<p>The second point, although you meant it as a joke, is actually harder to argue with - because it leaves reason so far behind it becomes difficult to have any meaningful discussion about it at all: there is nothing in principle to say against the argument that our whole environment and history could be manufactured. We would have no way of knowing that, in fact there would be no way of knowing the actual age of the universe. It could be 2 seconds old in that case. All we have to reason against this approach is an argument from plausibility and Occam&#x27;s razor.",1381357382

There are many applications which don&#x27;t mind the additional bytes at the end of such a manipulated file and present it&#x27;s contents just as it was without those bytes. This is especially true for image viewers and image files (for example .jpg and .png files) and for PDF readers (such as the Adobe Acrobat Reader or Evince) and PDF documents.</i><p>...<p><i>It were three major weaknesses in the TrueCrypt keyfile algorithm which facilitated the attack. The \nfirst weakness was the application of the cryptographically insecure CRC-32 algorithm. Its input \ncan easily be crafted to yield any desired output. The second weakness was the linearity of the \noperations by which the pool bytes were changed, that is the additions. This made the attack a \nsimple application of linear algebra. The third weakness was the local nature of changes to the \npool. Every byte of the keyfile only changes four bytes of the pool. This enabled us to do the attack \nsuccessively making one byte of the pool after the other zero.</i><p>Holy crap.  Any one of those weaknesses would be ridiculous from a security standpoint.  The fact that all three exist is evidence of incompetence, at the very least.  (Whether the incompetence is intentional or not is an open question.)<p>Not using CRC-32 is pretty much cryptography 101.  Avoiding linearity is &quot;preventing cryptanalysis 101&quot;.  Avoiding local changes to the output (i.e. every byte of the keyfile should change the output completely) is called the avalanche effect and is, similarly, an incredibly basic requirement of cryptography.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect</a><p>Here is TrueCrypt&#x27;s response to the attack:<p><i>“Hello,<p>First, thank you for reviewing our software–we really welcome and appreciate all inde-\npendent reviews. It should be noted that when we designed the keyfile processing \nalgorithm, we had been very well aware of the properties of the CRC-32 algorithm that \nyou mentioned in the document.<p>Below is our response to the attack you reported to us:<p>No matter what keyfile processing algorithm is used, if the attacker can modify the con-\ntent of your keyfile before you create your volume, he can reduce the entropy/strength \nof the keyfile. Just as you cannot allow an attacker to modify or prepare your password \nwhen you create a volume, you cannot allow an attacker to modify or prepare your key-\nfile before you create your volume, either. Otherwise, if you do that, you cannot reason-\nably expect to have any security.<p>It is a basic security requirement that cryptographic keys (whether passwords, keyfiles, \nor master keys) must be secret and unknown to attackers. Your attack violates this \nrequirement and is therefore invalid/bogus.<p>This is valid whether you use CRC-32 or HMAC-SHA-512, whether you use the True-\nCrypt keyfile processing algorithm or something different.<p>Thank you again for taking the time to review our software. We hope that the mistakes \nwill be corrected before the review is published (publishing an invalid attack would be \nmisleading).<p>Sincerely,<p>David<p>PS - Even if the attack was valid (it is not) and a cryptographically secure hash (such \nas HMAC-SHA-512) was used instead of CRC-32 (your suggested fix), the attacker \nwould still be able to &#x27;crack&#x27; your keyfile by a comparatively short brute force attack (it \nwould only be slightly slower, as the attacker would merely have to find the correct key-\nfile among the thousands or millions of keyfiles he crafted).”</i><p>... and here is the paper&#x27;s response to their response:<p><i>This response is mistaken. It fails to differentiate between the secrecy of a password or key and \nthe inability of an attacker to modify the password or key. The secrecy of the password and keyfile \nis indeed a basic prerequisite for the security of a TrueCrypt volume as it is in any other crypto-\ngraphic application. However, it is quite possible that an attacker is able to modify a keyfile to a cer-\ntain extent while that keyfile at the same time remains perfectly secret and unknown to him. The \npoint to be considered here is that cryptography has means to provide security even in such a \nweird situation.<p>As an example for such a situation consider an attacker who distributes an image editing software. \nHe might add our attack algorithm to his software so that it secretly manipulates any image it pro-\ncesses to have no effect as a TrueCrypt keyfile. Our algorithm is even small enough to run on \nembedded systems. Therefore, even a digital camera might process the pictures it takes and out-\nput manipulated picture files. The pictures would nevertheless show what the user wanted and \nwould remain unknown the the vendor of the camera or the image editing software. So they may \nbe kept secret although they have been modified by an attacker.<p>In that situation a keyfile algorithm based on HMAC-SHA-512 would provide perfect security while \nthe TrueCrypt keyfile algorithm fails completely. A brute force attack would be impossible as the \nattacker has not to find the correct keyfile among millions of keyfiles he crafted but among a practi-\ncally infinite number of possible pictures which might have been taken with his camera or pro-\ncessed with his image editing software.</i>",1381356992

Note that I am referring to the analog film version and not the modern digital M8 and later incarnations design, along with the Fender Stratocaster are the closest thing to perfection anyone has come up with.<p>The Stratocaster is a discussion for another time. In the case of the Leica, it is the best design because it distills the essence of the photographic expression and builds the product around that.  The controls are simple.  You have a shutter speed dial, a film crank, a shots taken indicator. Aperture control is on the lens barrel.  Any photographer can pick up a  Leica M and know how it works intuitively.  The controls fall right where they should. Its been 50 years, and no one really has come up with a better interface to take a picture.<p>This design throughs all of that out the window.  From the looks of the picture, it doesn&#x27;t look very comfortable to hold. It seems to rounded, and the &quot;cheese greater&quot; design is just asking for dust/environmental problems.  A well used Leica looks even more desirable with age, this would just look  hideous. This design just lost all of the elegance that 50 years of incremental design bestowed on the Leica M and turned it into something that looks like a Braun product.<p>Then lets move to the usability -- whats with the recessed dials??? the whole point of the dial placement ABOVE the top plate is so that the photographer can operate all the controls via his thumb without taking his mind away from the act of taking a picture.  This completely violates that principle. Not to mention all the ergonomic evolution the engineers at Leica spent so much time agonizing over.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, yes I do love the Leica M. I am not a zealot by any chance. I don&#x27;t claim they do everything but what they do -- they have perfected the design.  And here they just through all of that out the window.<p>If the goal was to make an advancement on the design, I would say take a close look at the Fuji X100s.  It has taken the Leica ethic and bridged it beautifully with the modern digital  age.  In fact I will say the Fuji X100s is the first classic of the digital age.",1381356721

Many scientists spend their entire lives proving something.

You could implement something that would always be one page ahead.<p>On page load you get the first two sets of scroll data.  When the user scrolls you show the second set of data you already have and then get the third set of data at that point.<p>This way you are always ahead and may make the scrolling seem smoother.<p>Just an idea though, looks good!",1381356267

Eastern religions, in particular, are founded on the basic idea that your everyday experience is illusory.<p>You dismiss religious beliefs as based on &quot;essentially nothing&quot;. In fact, the basis of religious belief in the most general sense is conscious experience. The kinds of conscious experience that you would probably call hallucinations. But, referring again to the link above, you are probably disposed to call shared perceptions &quot;real&quot;, and non-shared perceptions hallucinatory. Religiously, metaphysically, or even philosophically minded people might call that arbitrary. Chauvinistic even.

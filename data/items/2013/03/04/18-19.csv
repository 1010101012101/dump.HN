I contend that framing the question this way is contributing to the misunderstandings of what the advantages and disadvantages of the popular noSQL databases are, which become very apparent when one thinks of what happens when the data set gets very large.

Getting the full verbal support of a second-term lame-duck administration with nothing to lose is not a negligible achievement. Some progress != no progress. You're right that petitions have limited scope and effect, but in successful efforts like these, they can generate publicity and political momentum, giving ammunition and gravitas to Congressmen who would co-sponsor legislation. At the very least it is a step in the right direction.<p>The system is broken, but sitting back and needlessly berating those who would try to take small steps to achieve small goals is hardly an acceptable response. It's calculus; if you integrate a positive attitude over a large enough population of believers, you can effect large-scale change. If you integrate so-called ""cynical realism"" over the same intelligent population, you create a self-fulfilling prophecy of defeatism which is nothing to pat yourself on the back about, either.

The provision-of-services argument alone doesn't allow for the opportunity cost of all that tax money.<p>However, if the government is the only provider of a service and doesn't allow for private competition, as is often the case with the kinds of service being mentioned in this thread depending on where in the world you are and what your system of government is, then clearly it's difficult or even impossible to measure how well private competition would have done instead. Some cases of large-scale privatisation of important services have worked very well, yet other cases have failed horribly, so there's no obvious, black-and-white case for whether tax-funded public services are better or worse than privately funded commercial ones.",1362422374

Devs don't need to target Mir if they don't want to, Linux users can switch to another Debian if they don't like it, and the Layman discovers that Linux can possibly be just as shiny as Mac OS.\nCan someone explain to me why this is all so horrible?",1362421991

I must get a mailing from Macy's once a month, if not every other week with 10% off. If I was running JCP here's how I'd reinvent:<p>* Make the sales people dress up, _fitted_ suit/tie, ladies in sleek business atire in most areas, youth/petites follow what they allow at American Apparel/H&M/Gap employees attire. The brand is classic style, JC Penney was there growing up with basic style that translates into casual everyday wear. The sales people reinforce casual, yet approachable authority.<p>* Make it easy for the shopper, to get into mental space of styles. Formal fades into casual, but the sections are distinct with mannequins highlighting combos. Between have a ""style-lab"" that churns limited line clothing like Zara. Same stuff won't be there in a few weeks. 'Style' in this sense is very mild. The average JCP customer isn't a risk-taker.<p>* Store brands. JCP has a bevy of store brands, and these should be highlighted and re-imagined. JCP is now Trader Joes of clothes. Store brands aren't a Levi's (but you have Levi's), but are good enough for the price point.<p>* Store Card loyalty. This is probably the number one money maker. 0% APR 3 month specials all the time, %2 off everything when you use it, etc...<p>* Dumb Gadgets for $5 from China should be at the cashwraps. Churn these every month.<p>I grew up wearing mostly JCP clothes as a midwestern kid and I almost am banging my head on why this is so hard to understand how a Midwestern Mom shop and how to build a store that sells better-than-bigbox clothes that range from Casual to Formal and has a classic, yet forward approach.",1362421846

I used to teach my classmates algebraic concepts that they didn't understand fully, and once it ""clicked"" for them, they usually said something along the lines of ""Wow, that is really cool!""<p>So, this is the main conflict we're facing. You raise a generation of ""forced coders,"" and suddenly, nobody will want to code anymore, which is one problem. However, the other problem is that if you DO end up making forced instruction fun for kids, you will end up with mediocre programmers who think a ""Hello World"" is the equivalent of earning a CS degree, and startups will have to sift through dozens of perhaps low-quality applications rather than just sifting through the few that have the dedication to learn how to code.<p>Here's the solution: make CS more <i>accessible</i> to students. Have a bunch more electives on CS and encourage kids to take them. Trying to make coding/programming a part of the curriculum will take away time from important subjects such as composition, literature, science, and mathematics, all of which are arguably now more important than ever with test scores at record lows.",1362421430

First of all, with a not-quite-mainstream language like F#, you're more likely to have team members joining your projects who are lacking the relevant in-language expertise.  Making code more readable for them without significantly harming readability for an expert seems like a fine tradeoff.  Secondly, one benefit to F# is that the code can read almost like pseudocode, which opens up the possibility of having domain experts (that is, non-programmers) review code, in which case the same tradeoff also makes sense (see e.g. Jane St. Capital, where traders review some/most of their OCaml code).",1362421141

I just wanted to create a simple two column responsive layout with the ability to add columns easily within the main article column. Obviously, I'm not going to write that CSS myself: that'd be reinventing the wheel.<p>Stupidly, I started by using Bootstrap because it was the hot thing to do. I quickly stopped because I reailized I had to override far too much stuff to get what I wanted. Then I switched to Foundation, thinking it would be less opinionated and easier to override. I struggled with it for much longer and despite getting to a seemingly okay point with the development, there was a consistent yet hard to reproduce bug with JavaScript related to the collapsed top bar. On top of that, it still didn't look 'good' to me, and my CSS file wa already getting pretty big with the overriding styles, on top of the already big framework files.<p>Then I remembered that I had actually seen Skeleton on HN and had planned on using it, but forgot to (maybe I should use Evernote more). Deleted all my previous work, made a new design in 20 minutes, and within an hour I was back to the same point I was previous. I completed the rest within a day, and the blog is now good to go. Skeleton had all I needed: a responsive grid, good default styling, and good typography. I didn't need any of the other stuff that these Frameworks provided. I dropped Javascript entirely except for syntax highlighting via Prettify. I could also have, in retrospect, using the customize functions on the Foundation or Bootstrap websites (although they're not that flexible and I still would have had to override just as much stuff). But Skeleton was a perfect fit.<p>Had I used it originally, the development would have taken much less time than if I had tried to do all the necessary styling myself. Despite all the hiccups, it was probably quicker anyway.<p>TL;DR it should be obvious to most of you, but use as minimal as a framework as you need.",1362420961

If you have a friend who works in national security, the DOJ, the FBI, Homeland security, local police, or is an officer of the US military don't just stop being friends with them. Actively ruin their lives in whatever way you can without their knowledge. It helps to befriend these people, not ignore them. Sleep with their wives. Get them drunk. Lie when interviewed for their clearances. Tell their children curse words. Spread rumors about them in church. Ask them about old war stories and try to trigger their PTSD. Use your housing association to harass them. Spike the punch at their parties with LSD. Go to the shooting range with them and point out that they should really practice more.

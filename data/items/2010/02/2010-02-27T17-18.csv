No one is forcing these ideas on you, and it's easy to take shots at the ""man in the arena"" who steps forward to tackle a subject. I found it pretty interesting, as I had never thought much about the impact of this new class of ""achievement"" modern society has created.<p>These kinds of reactions only stifle dialogue and debate. I think it's generally understood that this is his opinion, and that he doesn't have designs to become a dictator and make this opinion the law of the land.",1267293553

Anyone who plays any game with a competitive focus will know this is false. It's very possible to fail at Starcraft or Warcraft III. I certainly fail at WC3. I'm not absolutely horrible, but if I played with any remotely good player, I would lose quickly every single time. It's not just possible to fail, it's normal for almost everyone to fail. In fact, if you consider losing a single game to be failing in that game, exactly 50% of all multiplayer SC or WC3 players fail. In free-for-all FPS games, the frequency of failure is even higher.",1267293544

(Side note: I've always been amazed at how quickly new ship and plane designs came out in war-time in the 1940s, but they were much simpler then and evolving much more rapidly.

When you take a continuous function and try to make it look discrete, what you'll notice is that there is 'some extra' between the actual merit curve and the stepwise function that touches it. These so-called meritocracies are just a way to skim that extra off the top.<p>Look at it this way, if you went in to take music lessons and your music teacher told you that in order to get to 'level 3' trumpet player you'd need to spend X years and Y thousands of dollars, you'd instantly see it was ridiculous. School is the same way, you just don't realize it because that's the way it's always been presented to you.",1267290600

I really don't think he's right about his grand vision of where the technology is headed, though.  The point system attracts a certain percentage of the population, its true.  But most people just don't get obsessed by points.  Only gamers really get really obsessed by the them, and not even all gamers do.  E.g. The credit card industry has been using the point rewards system forever, and it does drive sales, but if it were really the be all end all, all credit cards would have point rewards systems.<p>I think that Jesse Schell, while a really smart, insightful guy,  has trouble seeing the universe from outside the perspective of a hardcore gamer.  E.g., he sounded pretty shocked that the wii did so well.  I remember when the video of the Nintendo execs playing tennis was going around, and a lot of hardcore gamers failed to see the appeal.  Everyone else was just like, man, that looks insanely fun.  If you can't intuitively see the appeal of products that have a lot of mass appeal, it's kind of hard to predict where the technology is going to go.<p>Not saying I would be any better at predicting things.  I just don't see his predictions quite adding up.",1267290447

It was Jason Calacanis style PR strategy at its best and clever if intentional.  Why Ryan called getting a C&D a 'shitty move' is the non-congruent part. Ryan asked for it and Shankman delivered a delightfully poor response in spades.  Total PR coup for Ryan.<p>Side note: If you run a half decent business you'll have your fair share of C&D letters and meritless lawsuits.  Not worth wasting any emotion over.

We finally found a buyer for our house, and since we were moving across the country, we quickly took a short trip to pick out a new house. We had to decide on a place within days while not being at all familiar with the area. I think it was the most stressful time of my entire life - and I'm married and have a child!<p>Then the deal fell through on our house which canceled the deal on the house there, and for a moment it was a great weight removed! Except then we'd have to do it all over again because we were back to square one - despair and a whole new level of stress set it.<p>Finally, my employer decided that we didn't have to move after all and that working remotely was going just fine and it wasn't worth the effort. Suddenly the world was a brighter place, the sale sign removed from the yard, and the extended family was happy again.<p>How anyone could not realize all that stress is beyond me - and we didn't even actually move!",1267290237

I&#x27;m giving them the benefit of memory with the number. I was guilty of driving an older car, hair slightly below my ears, and the ultimate sin; driving after 10 p.m. Friday-Saturday.<p>Told to empty out my pockets because I was talking to a homlessness person.<p>At least three tickets, where I honestly didn&#x27;t know what law I broke.  I once kindly asked the officer to diagram what I did wrong.  He did and even initialed it.  Street wrong, wrong color car.  He didn&#x27;t show up n court.  (Highway Patrol harldy ever shows up, and they are well coached.  Local cops will always show up--there&#x27;s not much to do in the burbs.)<p>Watch my dad get out of a DUI, because he as giving a get out of jail card.  His buddy gave him his detective&#x27;s business card, with some scribbling on back.<p>Done Coke at two different parties, and the supplier were both in law enforcement.  Great Coke--I guess?  (I was much younger, and honestly, really didn&#x27;t even like the Coke effects.   I think I was drinking too much at the party?  I&#x27;m no angel.)<p>In college, I worked as a life guard.  The lonely Sherriff would hang with us.  He would leave a party if mariguana was in the air, but would get stinky drunk, and drive us around.  When we got pulled over, he would Just pull out the Bagde.  Yes--I went along.  Never like the hypocracy of the dude.<p>Watched a Francisco cop drive my high school sister, and her model friend to the north side of the bridge, actually they escorted her.  They allowed her to drive drunk.  One then asked for her phone number.  Yes--it&#x27;s great they didn&#x27;t ticket/arrest her, but only because she was young, and attractive.<p>Listen to my dad complain about his cop best friend who just played chess in the basement of the corner building.  My dad thought they should be out cruising for the bad guys.  I asked my father, &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t you rather them playing chess, over looking for cheezy tickets?&quot;  Father, &quot;Well yes.&quot;  (I see nothing wrong with doing nothing while on shift, especially in low crime areas.  And I don&#x27;t expect cops to risk their lives.  Honestly.)<p>What has this thought me; buy two cheap dash cams from China.  $15 a piece.  Just don&#x27;t drive certain nights.  If you are going to go to the evil bar/hootenanny, buy a $19 breath analyzer at Costco.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine what minorites have been through, as I am a white dude.  Am I an angel--hell no.  I guess I&#x27;m just unlucky?  When I was younger, I honestly didn&#x27;t think slightly longer hair, and a VW would equate with being harassed, but it did.  Do I get harrrased as much now--no.  I don&#x27;t go out like I did, and I drive a car that&#x27;s inconspicuous, with no bumper stickers.  I once put a Police Officers Association sticker on my rear window; trying  to invoke reverse psychology.  Well it just bought in a red brick.<p>Do I see people being treated like they had no rights--hell yes, more than ever.  The image of a women being forced to empty her purse because she was sitting on the sidewalk is my latest imprint.  She was bum rushed by five cops, and a particularly eager female cop whom frisked her too agressively.  They left her alone after finding nothing suspicious in her purse, but took her picture.  Love to take those pictures?<p>Again I know they have a tough job, but don&#x27;t make up tickets.  Get to know the law--other than on the job.   Oh yea, we all don&#x27;t get roaring drunk when we go out?  You might, but most of us don&#x27;t.  We are not, &quot;Just like you on our days off?&quot;.  As to the danger of the job; I do morn the death of an honest cop, but actually deaths are higher in construction/taxi cab drivers.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is don&#x27;t stereotype, and make up drama.  I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;ll live to see the day where I don&#x27;t cringe when a cruiser is behind me?  Done!",1454021946

10992053,comment,10983747,10983747,0,0,enziobodoni1,,,"To start with, I am a clinical lab medical director and clinical pathologist. I&#x27;ve commented on Theranos a few times before on HN. That said, I think three things have been missed in all of this<p>1) There are a lot of bad labs out there like Theranos, and Theranos&#x27; story is thus only unique because of how pumped up it got. Clinical labs are &quot;old economy&quot; businesses, and the idea that someone could sprinkle &quot;new economy&quot; fairy dust and turn it into an Uber or Netflix success story is more about the echo chamber that is Silicon Valley, the general lack of scientific interest or rigor in clinical diagnostics in the tech industry, a somewhat Aspergey yet charismatic CEO, black turtlenecks, and friendship with important ex-government officials and VC folks than anything special about what was going on in their laboratory. Plenty of labs have been caught and shut down for what Theranos has done, and while I didn&#x27;t think that it was actually occurring there, I am not terribly surprised.<p>2) The magic of their Edison box, even if it had turned out to work, was not nearly as impressive if you know anything about how clinical labs operate today. The claims that they have made (can do tests on MICROLITERS and have imprecision LESS THAN 5-10%!) are actually standard these days for many assays. As a lab director, I was always disturbed by the lay press puff pieces that said things about Theranos that were totally uninteresting and unimpressive to anyone knowledgeable...what clearly happened was that no one at Forbes, etc.. actually asked anyone who works in a clinical lab to comment. The commentary always focused more on the phenomenon of Theranos, rather than the substance...probably because the substance was super boring.<p>3) What has consistently been missed, and is still missed today, is that even if Theranos&#x27; technology worked and their labs weren&#x27;t being run with a criminal disregard for standard laboratory practice, is that Theranos&#x27; business objectives would STILL be a horrible idea. Their push to democratize health information, to do more testing early to prevent disease rather than detect late, to test for lots of things in healthy people to increase &quot;wellness&quot;, etc... is all total bullshit. With few exceptions, lab tests are for sick people, and testing healthy people with lots of tests simply consumes money and generates false positive results that are expensive to work up. Also, there are NO TESTS for all of the conditions (cancers, etc...) that they claim to be helping you detect early. Getting your sodium and potassium levels weekly won&#x27;t help you avoid kidney disease, cancer, or diabetes, but it will make your pocketbook shrink and it will give you some falsely abnormal values 1 in 20 times you do it. This has been the true play of Theranos, which is to do a massive amount of testing on well people, marketed directly to healthly people without the advice of doctors, with the intent of arming a bunch of worried well people with an avalanche of insignificant noisy information to present to their physicians. This helps no one other than Theranos.<p>I have often seen a lot of objections to (3) from people on HN, especially tech-sorts who think that they are better able to handle data than the average person. However, this is fundamentally flawed. For those who are interested in Bayesian analyses, consider the utility of any test when the pre-test probability is low - the answer is that positive results are almost always false positives, or at least difficult to interpret.  The answer is not getting more tests, even if it&#x27;s cheap. Lab tests these days ARE cheap...it&#x27;s the clinical followup that is expensive.<p>I will be very interested to see how this all plays out now. The big players, Labcorp and Quest, have both tried the direct-to-consumer/in-drugstore model for testing, and amusingly actually shut their offerings down years ago because of lack of interest. The truth of the matter is that making health information more available to people sounds great, but really, the only people who end up collecting that information are affluent, worried-well people who should be discouraged from testing in the first place. The people who need more routine testing are poor, socially-underserved and neglected people with chronic illnesses, but I do not think that Theranos is planning on opening test facilities in Flint, Michigan to give Hemoglobin A1c monitoring tests for free to the elderly impoverished people there. To the contrary, they&#x27;ve tried to open in areas where they can get customers who they can trap into believing that they need lab tests like they need step counts from a fitbit.

10992048,comment,10991002,10991496,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"&quot;Money from the future&quot; is a way of describing using future GDP to pay for current goods. Its a bet that what ever you are using the money for will result in a way to pay it back in the future while still benefiting from the investment.<p>Simple example: I borrow $50,000 from a bank to open a restaurant.<p>Lets split that into two bets:<p>First, I bet that from my <i>future</i> revenue, I&#x27;ll be able to pay back the bank <i>and</i> keep operating my restaurant. So in my own time line if you will I am taking money I&#x27;ll be earning from paying customers in the <i>future</i> and using it in the <i>present</i> to actually build my restaurant. The way I do this is with a bank.<p>Second, the bank kind of believes and kind of doesn&#x27;t believe that I can pay it back. So it says &quot;we&#x27;ll take some money we have laying about and give it to you to open a restaurant, but you have to pay it all back to us in 10 years and every year we want an additional 7.2% from you. What that means is that after 10 years you will have paid them back <i>double</i> the amount of money you borrowed.<p>So I&#x27;ve taken $50,000 of my future revenue, and turned it into a monthly obligation to the bank of $834. So if I sell my pies for $8.34, the first 100 pies of every month end up having all that money going to the bank which loaned me the money. So in my &quot;present&quot; money is going to pay off my &quot;past&quot; borrowing. Had I not taken the loan that $834 would go right into my pocket.<p>In a Macro Economic sense, if you take on debt, and invest the capital represented by that debt to grow the economy, then in the future the larger economy, some of the GDP is going to servicing (or paying off) that debt rather than additional growth. If your economy cannot sustain that drag (debt service) then it tends to contract, which makes it even less able to support that drag. If you read George Soros he will tell you that any day now the entire world is going to implode in just that fashion :-).<p>The careful thing you have to watch out for is talking about &quot;money&quot; which everyone thinks of as bills and coins or balances in a bank account, and &quot;GDP&quot; which is essentially the &quot;value&quot; created by all of the economic activity in an economy. Governments try to manage their economy to grow its GDP, and because transactions in the economy are often (but not always!) transacted using the national currency, economic figures are often reported in terms of dollars or yuan or yen or what have you. But you have to remember that you can have an economy that doubles in size, the the size of the monetary denominational transactions might be the same, more (inflation), or less (deflation).<p>China is in the situation of trying to show the world a growing GDP (their economy). They have a spotty track record when it comes to how accurately they compute that :-) but fundamentally if they cannot actually grow it, then the debt they hold which they created in order to grow, will not  be serviceable without shrinking the size of their economy. The traditional &quot;fix&quot; for that is that the exchange rate between economic value and currency changes so that the numbers match. China allows the Yuan to &quot;inflate&quot; to 10x its current value, and then services the debt with this inflated value.<p>But what that really means is you aren&#x27;t selling enough pizzas so you start charging $834 per pizza and just by selling one a month you can meet your monthly debt payment. And the citizen says &quot;Gee, remember when you could get a nice pizza for less than $10? I miss those days.&quot;",1454021014

It&#x27;s just a &quot;right-now minimal-hassle&quot; way to make front-end dev&#x27;s lives easier, nothing more.<p>Maybe Microsoft disagrees, but I see TypeScript as something intended to make itself obsolete: eventually, when all browsers are running ES9 (or whichever version we decid has fixed &quot;all&quot; of JavaScript&#x27;s problems) or WebAssembly (and we&#x27;re all writing front-end code in C#/C++/Ruby/whatever), then TypeScript will just fade away, by design. For now, it&#x27;s kinda like JQuery in motivation if not literally architecture: it shields you from browser inconsistencies (in this case, where you don&#x27;t know what ES version the target is running) and helps you avoid JavaScript&#x27;s headaches.

10991896,comment,10988909,10988909,0,0,50CNT,,,"The &quot;self-explanatory&quot;/&quot;brevity&quot; problem is quite interesting. It reminds me of the point Donald Norman made in &quot;The Design of Everyday Things&quot;, where information is either found in the world, or in our heads, coupled with issues of information-density. When we pick names, it&#x27;s a trade-off between abbreviated (-> fast to use), descriptive (-> fast to learn), and mnemonic (-> easy to remember).<p>I roughly divide naming problems into 3 areas mentally. Most commonly used commands(/functions/identifiers/...), commonly used commands, and rarely used commands.<p>Most commonly used commands are things like ls or cd or mkdir. Due to their usage frequency, an intermediate user will remember these by heart, and mentally substitute their long forms whilst reading them out. Technically we could assign these to even shorter codes, but  then they would loose their mnemonic value.<p>Preferably they would also have a long-form alias to provide a certain amount of easing into them. (list-directory, change-directory, make-directory)<p>Commonly used commands should not be abbreviated as readily. The few extra characters required to type them are usually well worth the additional clarity. Pythons .deepcopy() is a good example. It copies a data structure and its sub-structures completely. .dpcp() would be a lot harder to remember given how often it is used.<p>It should be possible to alias these to shorter versions as well, should someone have to use them frequently. Auto-complete functionality may also reduce the amount of memorization necessary whilst typing these in.<p>I personally think emacs handles these two cases very well, \nwith it&#x27;s quick chords that need to be memorized but provide speed, and calling commands by name via M-x which provides ease of use.<p>Then there&#x27;s the rarely used stuff. These names may get very long if they are to be descriptive (ncursescplusplusmusicplayer), which means that they, or parts of them should probably be abbreviated (nccppmp, or preferably nccpp-musicplayer). Runs of abbreviated words should not become too long, 3-5 characters being the maximum. Past that length, it becomes hard to remember which characters one has already typed. (ncpmpp? or nccppmp?). Past that sensible chunking through full words or hyphenation may become necessary.<p>I do think these are sensible rules of thumb, but then they are rules of thumb, and there are most likely thousands of exceptions to them.",1454019762

For instance, Arlington, VA (home of the Pentagon and Arlington Cemetery) has 10-20 story buildings and elects its sheriff, as does neighboring Alexandria, VA (a colonial city that predates DC). I believe all cities and counties in VA elect sheriffs.<p>>They may choose to side with the lowest ranks of police, but it&#x27;s not as bad as a simple &quot;my direct boss didn&#x27;t pay me enough, let&#x27;s all vote him or her out.&quot;<p>In a place with elected leadership and limitless funds, so long as your union has enough critical mass, it&#x27;s in the best interests of all members of the police force to push for higher wages, more stringent work rules, etc.<p>Why wouldn&#x27;t they do this? There are no consequences for failure and lots to gain. It&#x27;s not like a company where middle management wants to keep costs down; in the government your importance has to do with the size of your budget and number of reports and there&#x27;s no negative feedback. In fact, because of how budgeting works in America, every dollar must be spent, and any savings will end up with a smaller budget next year. If anything, middle management is aligned with these demands.<p>The exceptions are agencies like WMATA or the MTA, where a significant portion of revenue comes from fares or advertisements. These are more likely to fight unions, but they are still state (or multi-state and Federal in the case of WMATA) agencies that at the end of the day answer to politicians and can still get government bailouts.<p>>But as a somewhat pro-union point, remember that public employees aren&#x27;t bonused anywhere near private sector employees<p>Many public sector employees have absolutely sweet benefits, though. Good healthcare, good pensions or retirement funds, unions to go to bat for them, extreme job security, limited hours, etc. For certain classes of work government employees do make more than their private sector counterparts, but this is mostly related to low end work.<p>At the high end the government absolutely pays worse, you&#x27;re right. The max salary in the normal Federal general schedule is roughly $160K.<p>I think this is part of the reason for demanding absurd rules and benefits, since salaries are set by law, not on the market, and the electorate doesn&#x27;t want to hear about (or pay for) top talent making big bucks. Politicians respond to these incentives and cap salaries.",1454019254

Many testers report by exception so if the customer gets a relatitvely clean report they may be happy with that, but if the report doesn&#x27;t detail the testing completed, how do they know the tester just didn&#x27;t miss things from the review?  You could enforce a consistent reporting style with tests completed to address that, but I&#x27;d guess that some testing companies wouldn&#x27;t appreciate being asked to re-tool their reporting process.<p>- The model seems to imply the customer scopes the review.  In my experience for organisation with less experience of security testing, that&#x27;s one of the hardest parts to get right.  More experienced/larger companies would, I&#x27;d expect, be less likely to use this kind of service as they already have a panel process/procurement in place.  If Stealth Worker are going to participate in the scoping proces it would need the right set of people to complete that task (not a massively common skillset in my experience as it needs a good combination of technical experience and business understanding)<p>- Will the marketplace validate vendor claims of competence/skillset, and if so how will they do that?  This could be a good value add, but is expensive to do well (e.g. designing and running assessments for candidate companies to provide a level of assurance of skill in particular areas).<p>- It&#x27;ll be challenging to create an international model for this, as the regulatory requirements are different per country, and whilst testing companies might currently have indemnity insurance in their local market, that may well not cover international situations.<p>- The site could use some fleshing out on the team side. Currently says &quot;Stealth Worker is a team of CISOs, developers and lawyer&quot; .... To me there&#x27;s a large ommission there which is from that it implies you don&#x27;t have any testers on staff?!?  I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s not the case, so it&#x27;d be worth making sure that was in clear on the site.<p>*Pet peeve, I prefer the term security testing to pen testing. The term pen testing rarely describes what most organisations actually need and also what is delivered.  Pen testing implies a black box adversarial review &quot;emulates a malicious attacker&quot;. This is only really desirable for mature organisations who have a strong handle on all the basic (which is not, in my experience, the majority).  Also truly emulating attackers is very difficult as they tend not to worry about breaking the law, unlike testing companies (you&#x27;d hope!)",1454018994

Proving that it happened to you, individually, is very hard.  But it happens.  The 4th is violated.  And once it is, we&#x27;re dependent upon the good will and honesty of the government to forget what they saw that they were not supposed to do so.<p>The standard which I want to see for all parts of the Constitution - including the 4th - is that the burden of proof is on the government to guarantee that no wrong is done.

You could of course argue that modded Android ROMs also have little appeal to the mainstream, and so adding non-mainstream features to modded ROMs is cool.

There is no pixie dust that will magically overcome inherent distributed systems limitations. ZooKeeper simplifies the process of implementing distributed coordination but it does not eliminate the core issues - so why has this system become so popular over the past few years? In this talk I will explore what ZooKeeper is, how it was originally developed, how projects such as HBase, Hadoop and others are using it, what it can (and can&#x27;t) do for you, and what&#x27;s to come.<p>About Patrick 
Patrick Hunt is a major contributor and PMC member on the Apache ZooKeeper project. He joined Cloudera more than three years ago and currently leads the Cloudera Search team. Previous to Cloudera he spent five years at Yahoo! where he specialized in large-scale distributed systems architecture. During this time he also drove development of the critically acclaimed Delicious firefox extension. Prior to joining Yahoo, Patrick worked on enterprise software, founded a startup, designed high performance network software, and dabbled a bit with rocket science (NASA). He has a bachelors degree in Computer Systems Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.<p>Dinner, prepared by Airbnb&#x27;s Executive Chef, will served at 6pm.<p>https://www.airbnb.com/meetups/9j9ykz5je-tech-talk-patrick-hunt",1371427699

If we spent half the GDP on anti-terrorism after 9/11 you would be claiming 9/11 cost us half the GDP and that therefore justifies spending half the GDP on it. It&#x27;s circular logic.",1371427471

Perhaps it would have been in a different country or continent, but there has been military action under every administration since Eisenhower.  I have this sneaky suspicion that the war in Iraq would have happened <i>regardless</i> of any terrorist attack.  I would even go as far as to say that the war in Iraq would have happened under a hypothetical Gore administration.<p>&quot;So out of all the things the government does protecting its citizens seems like something that will always be &quot;worth the money&quot;.&quot;<p>Assuming, of course, that this program has accomplished anything.

Or at least Microsoft, where I learned to interview and coached my own team of interviewers over several years.<p>1) Basic coding questions are a nice filter. If you can&#x27;t remove an element from a doubly-linked list in C on a whiteboard immediately after graduating, what were you doing the last four/five years? It&#x27;s like the height signs before an amusement park ride: &quot;you must be at least this competent.&quot; These are not intended to be hard problems. You should not be crippled if you &quot;think differently&quot; or &quot;form important theories.&quot; Further, dropping one on the floor is not a deal-killer; you just have to get most of them.<p>2) Do you really understand how a computer works? If I give you some inputs (or you come up with them), can you walk through your program and describe the execution and memory state in some detail? You&#x27;d be shocked how many 4.0 GPA CS students from Stanford/etc. cannot. I am willing to teach new graduates how to work at scale. At a top firm, I am not willing to send them back to school to take Operating Systems and Architecture again.<p>3) Can we have a discussion about your code and the problem without you breaking down completely? More edge cases, expand it to a broader domain, increase perf (MSFT), scale it to web size (Google), etc.<p>None of these are raw IQ measures. If you want to see such measures, look to the finance industry where, for example, my wife had to take the Wonderlic Test during one interview, which is definitely more a measure of &quot;raw sprinting smarts.&quot;",1371427313

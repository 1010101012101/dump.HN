If my parents were world class martial artists, I&#x27;d probably be pretty good at martial arts.<p>One part practice and experience - a good amount of skill acquisition can only come from doing and refining that skill. You can read about how to run long distances, but at some point you just have to put in the miles. The more you do, the more you learn.<p>One part obsession - to be the best in the world, you have to have a ridiculous amount of determination. Most people don&#x27;t have that for most of what they do. The ones who reach the highest levels tend to go beyond determination to obsession. Read about how Kobe Bryant or Michael Jordan practiced and prepared and you realize that they weren&#x27;t just doing &quot;deliberate practice&quot;, they were obsessed with greatness and that obsession drove them beyond what anyone else was willing to do.<p>One part luck - even if everything else aligns you can get hurt, something else could sideline your career, you might fight a drug addiction or have family problems or an illness. Also, being lucky enough to get certain opportunities come your way at the right time often plays a big factor.<p>When you have all of those things come together you have something special.

However,  special relativity says there is nothing special about any particular space or time interval because if somebody was going fast enough,  an interval that looks like a planck interval to most people could get expanded or shrunk to something big like a kilometer or an hour.<p>But following that line of reasoning is problematic if there is no special reference frame,  since for all I know I already am going incredibly fast relative to some imaginary observer.<p>Doubly-special relativity manages to preserve the invariance of the speed of light under ordinary conditions but also preserve the invariance of plankian quantities under extreme conditions.  Related theories also bring in the idea of a special reference frame which means you might be able to &quot;push&quot; against the vacuum.<p>The main trouble jiving that with these experiments is that the energy scale at which DSS effects come into play is huge,  way out in grand unification country,  so it&#x27;s hard to believe it could be probed by these experiments.",1406817896

However, this would be an <i>enormous</i> breakthrough if it pans out, even at the low levels NASA has seemingly confirmed.<p>We&#x27;re very good at generating power in space; solar is basically infinite in the inner parts of our solar system, and we have a lot of experience with RTGs and other power generation mechanisms. If we can directly turn power into thrust without burning fuel in the process, this truly changes everything.<p>But as I said, I think this will end up not panning out for one of these reasons: 1) The microwaves bouncing around cause a small amount of material to be lost and be sent out of the device, causing the thrust. 2) The RF in play is throwing off detection (this, to me, seems most likely -- it could explain the thousandfold difference in detected thrust levels between the Chinese and US tests). 3) Some sort of effect that is linked to gravity. No idea what, though.<p>I really look forward to further testing.<p>Edit: Given that I&#x27;m terrible with the scale of small numbers, I decided to do some quick math.  If you were to use that thrust of 50 micronewtons to drive the Voyager spacecraft (722kg) full out for one year from a starting velocity of 0m/s, you would end up at 0.0911259m/s at the end of the year.

8114151,comment,8112891,8113905,7,0,jacquesm,,,"Because it would be more expensive and the space gain would be very small.<p>Battery geometry is mostly dictated by physics and economics, even though a flat plate battery would be denser the gains in density would be off-set by the increase in cost and in the end the wasted space doubles as a cooling channel so you might end up having to separate your flat plates by periodic air channels anyway.<p>The reason why flat plates are better in some applications (for instance, for starter batteries in cars) is because those batteries are optimized for very high current during very short bursts of time. 300 Amps @ 12V is 3.6KW out of a <i>very</i> compact little box. The power generated from that little package is extremely impressive (if you pull the distributor cap on your car (if you have an old car) you can actually move the car for a bit on the starter engine in first gear or reverse!) but because of the short duration the power absorbed by the battery is relatively small (current is absorbed by the internal resistance of the battery during charge and discharge leading to a warming up of the battery).<p>But it does not last for very long so heat removal is not usually a problem, and the charge currents are reasonably low, so again no big problem in removing the heat (low current, longer time).<p>With electric vehicles the situation is reversed, the discharge time is relatively long (hours) but the charge times are getting ever shorter which means packs have to be actively cooled to avoid overheating, and the easiest way to do that is to flow air through gaps in the cells.",1406815638

8114144,comment,8111406,8113966,8,0,antimagic,,,"Yup, let me tell a story.<p>Last time I was in the US, back in May, I found myself staying in Murfreesboro (Civil War buff here!).  But I wasn&#x27;t right in the city center, such as it is, but rather on the outskirts, the suburbs.  There were about 50 restaurants within half a mile of the motel, but to get to them, you either had to take your car, or take your life into your own hands walking across a six lane highway, which was the major access road to the Interstate.  Of course you cross at the lights, unless you&#x27;re completely suicidal, but here&#x27;s where it all goes bad.<p>There were no pedestrian lights at the intersection.<p>There were no islands in the middle of the intersection.<p>At any given moment for the half of the road that was leaving the intersection, there was nearly always traffic flowing (no pedestrian lights you see)<p>That meant that you could cross the first half of the road, whilst that half was stopped waiting to get into the intersection.  Tricky, what with turn right on red after stop, turn left on arrow and so on, but it could be done.  But now, when you go to cross the second half, you have to watch behind for cars turning left into your road, as well as watching forwards for cars turning right.  Both need to be clear, both rarely are.  There is often not a gap between those cars running the amber light, and the cars from across the intersection starting, which means that a pedestrian can find themself stuck in the middle of a six lane highway with flowing traffic going passed on both sides of them.  Fun!<p>Even after having run the gauntlet, you get to the other side, the one with the shops and restaurants, only to discover that there are no sidewalks - you either walk on the unpaved verge, unlit, with holes dug by groundhogs and rabbits, and metal stakes put into the ground for some long forgotten reason but never pulled out, or you walk on the road.<p>So much for walkability in the suburbs.",1406815559

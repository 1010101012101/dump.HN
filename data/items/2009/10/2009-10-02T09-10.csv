Those clients, in turn, spent $9,100 in his practice.""<p>So if he paid $2,345 for 67 calls, Yext was charging him $35/call.  That's a pretty nifty digit.",1254477594

856704,comment,856301,856547,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"While this is a particularly nasty situation, absolutely off-the-wall meltdown behaviour like this is actually pretty common in startups when things start going bad. Anyone remember the meltdown between the partners in the documentary Startup.com (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0256408/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0256408/</a>)? I think most people at least have the wherewithal not to air the dirty laundry out in public.<p>It's just another risk and potential downside to partnering with someone in business. Everybody's done something at least a little bit crazy and out-of-character when a romantic relationship has hit the rocks. Maybe you did something innocent but pathetic like burning compilation CDs (i.e. Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist). But we've all heard of the crazy girlfriend who dumps her (now ex-) boyfriend's stuff in front of the house after catching him cheating. Business partnerships aren't all that different. Really they involve the same levels of emotional attachment and passion.<p>It's important to try to assess the behaviours that a potential partner reverts to when under stress. For programmers, that might be shutting the world out and ignoring calls/emails rather than facing the music when there's a disagreement over deliverables. For non-programmer business-types, that might be writing and re-writing business plans and coming up with rather dreamy fantasy plans rather than actually getting deals done. These particular cases I think are the more common revertive behaviours (for lack of a known proper term) for programmers and business types. They're also behaviours that tend to drive the other party in such a partnership absolutely bonkers.<p>You definitely don't want someone who reverts to a temper tantrum like this guy from fundable. To be fair to him, this is most likely a sad case of both partners having individual meltdowns simultaneously.",1254477306
856702,comment,856317,856317,0,0,10ren,,,"Let me try to understand this:<p>1. ""pay per action"" is paying for a qualified lead, as opposed to a raw lead (which could be anything, e.g. even a wrong number).<p>2. Doing it with phone calls (as opposed to clicks on online ads, or emails etc), because that is how many businesses and their customers contact each other. e.g. gyms, vets, car repairs.<p>3. Doing it for local businesses.<p>The technical achievement of speech recognition is significant. I like his point that because the speech is interpreted relative to a specific business type, the domain is highly specialized, and so the task of recognizing the particular terms of that domain is much easier. I've been impressed by automatic speech recognition for telephone directory lookup - for me, it works 90% of the time; and that's out of the whole phone book, not restricted to a domain. I guess this is an example of ""speech recognition"" is still not good enough in general, but it's good enough in specific roles.<p>The next step after ""pay per action"" would be ""pay per sale"", which Google can do when you use both their adwords and their payment facility (I don't know how well that's working).<p>Anyone care to correct my misunderstandings, or elaborate on these points?",1254477255

c)Talk with friends about it.<p>For the kind of work I do, just putting myself to work won't help, e.g if I broke with my gf I can't help but I will be 85 per cent of my time thinking about her, or if someone of my family dies(my mind just says: F*CK THAT stupid work thing, this is more important!!.<p>Only when I solve the issues, I'm free, just look at Graham Chapman funeral:

Why should you quote page after page after page, when quoting the subject, one line of context, and then your one new line, is not only enough, but time saving and preferable?<p>The answer is obvious - people are simply too lazy.<p>There is a less obvious (to me) answer.

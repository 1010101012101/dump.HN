Obviously UI is about more than looking pretty, but I was arguing the the Google Instant experience is a good example of testing producing a result that's far from optimal (and which could be a lot better).<p>As for iTunes, obviously, if you read the piece, I wasn't comparing it to Google. I was comparing the <i>process</i> that produced it -- and how Apple has always gotten better in UI, with each generation, while adding complexity. I don't think Google can really say that for themselves, as the profusion of Google products shows.",1284652719

And then a year passed, and it became inconsistent; not in the smoothness but in the mechanism's ability to detect motion. I'm not alone in this complaint, it seems to be a relatively common defect.<p>The worst part of that mouse, though, is that it requires a special USB transmitter. Originally it was quite long, but subsequent versions have reduced the size. No matter, though, because the range is still terrible on the RF transmission. If you have a big, roomy desk (or keep the transmitter on a KVM off to the side), then you're going to frequently run into the mouse pointer freezing as the mouse and transmitter re-establish a correction. Unless it has line of sight, it <i>will</i> happen. I found it maddening, and had to stop using the device.<p>Oh, it's also obvious that he never used a 2009-style Apple “Magic” Mouse.

Technology, web design, psychology of people online, etc. I notice that when I design a business plan, I think in terms of actual use cases from each participant, and why they would do each step.

This is how I approach business, using what I know.<p>But there's other stuff out there, SEO, guerilla marketing, PR, etc. and I completely avoid it in my designs because I don't know too much about it. That's why it's good to have a partner who can be involved with talking to PR people and marketing agencies and architecting real-world campaigns when the time is right. Whenever there was a problem, I tried to solve it myself using the tools that I know.

Every single last one of them is terrible. Some were so terrible it boggles the mind (the hockey puck, <i>shudder</i>). Before the optical mouse, it always amazed me that Apple mice tended to gum up and get clogged far more than any other brand.<p>When Microsoft first released their first optical mouse (was it the very first optical mouse? I don't know, but it was the first one I knew of. This was about '98 or so) I eagerly paid the $80 for the behemoth (the thing was huge). Not having to deal with an Apple mouse getting clogged all the time alone made this mouse worth it, nevermind actually having more than one button.<p>People always point out the magic mouse. I hate it just as much as any other Apple mouse. I have a magic mouse about 2 feet from me as I type this. It seems like Apple can never get everything right. The Magic Mouse is fine on the top side of it, but the bottom has so much friction that moving it around on the desk is a stuttery, frustrating chore.<p>Interestingly, I've always found Microsoft makes the best mice.

More Any Rand gibberish.<p>If we're converting to a world where giving away your fortune is reprehensible immorality and greedily amassing a Scrooge McDuck-sized pool of gold is the new golden rule, count me out.<p>What the Randians never seem to understand (as I hop on my soap box) is that the world they want so badly to exist has. The world, red in tooth and claw, existed for millions of years. And here's the thing: it sucked. That's why moral systems developed and evolved beyond their biological inevitability. In a world where individual success is elevated over concern for others, Saddam Hussein is a moral hero. I'll pass on that world. I'll stick with boring old Mother Teresa.<p>(hop off soap box)",1284649345

In the case of that one feature if Apple HAD ""copied from Android"" it would probably have been better than what they actually did. What Apple did (in iOS 5) was integrate with ONE specific social network, Twitter, working directly with that company to accomplish this. What Android did if I understand correctly was make a general service available for sharing to things <i>like</i> social networks generally. I don't think Apple has (yet) copied that feature at all. (I could be wrong, because the parent poster's comment was vague, made in passing, and not since elaborated.)<p>I don't think it's questionable at all that Samsung copied its ""trade dress"" from Apple, just as it had earlier copied from Blackberry. Or that they explicitly copied lots of specific features from Apple.<p>(Though I agree that we might be better off with less <i>protection</i> against that sort of copying.

4521491,comment,4520981,4521131,12,0,Jabbles,,,"The practical difference is that there is (partial) enforced checking of errors. If you do not wish to check the error code, you must be explicit.<p><pre><code>    f := os.Create(""output.txt"")\n</code></pre>\nWill give a compile error<p><pre><code>    multiple-value os.Create() in single-value context:\n</code></pre>\nand should be written as one of these:<p><pre><code>    f, err := os.Create(""output.txt"")\n    f, _ := os.Create(""output.txt"")\n</code></pre>\nwhere the second indicates that you are ignoring the returned error.<p>I say ""partial"" because if you ignore all the return values you can implicitly ignore an error:<p><pre><code>    fmt.Println(""Hello"")\n</code></pre>\nIt is quite common to see:<p><pre><code>    if err != nil {\n        //handle error\n    }\n</code></pre>\nin Go, as their philosophy is that the caller should handle the error, not an unrelated piece of code. Yes, this does sometimes look like ""litter"", and it doesn't really make for the most impressive code. However, you won't be surprised by it, it's simple to understand, and if something goes wrong, you'll know what, when, and what was done about it. This has been Google's opinion on C++ for a while. <a href=""http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml?showone=Exceptions#Exceptions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.x...</a> lists some pros and cons. Writing code that ignores errors is one way of writing code, I think it's idiomatic Java and Python (please correct me), but that's not the way that was chosen for Go.<p>I don't really use panic() except to indicate bugs:<p><pre><code>    if playerCount == 2{\n        go multiPlayer()\n    } else if playerCount == 1{\n        go singlePlayer()\n    } else {\n        panic(playerCount)\n    }\n</code></pre>\nHowever they can be useful inside libraries. For example if you call fmt.Printf(""%s"",s), where s has a method s.String(), will print the result of s.String(). Sound good?\nBut what if s is a nil pointer? Well, you may wish s.String() to handle that and return ""A nil s"", which is fair enough. However is s.String does not handle this case it may panic(), leaving fmt.Printf to recover() and write ""<nil>"" instead.<p><a href=""http://golang.org/src/pkg/fmt/print.go#L630"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/src/pkg/fmt/print.go#L630</a>",1347629154

However, when I restored it from backups, I find that the music (from itunes match) and the apps were all gone.<p>Now I realise that technically the backup must mean the app data, and the settings etc.  So it was a bit of a relief as when we redownloaded the apps nothing appeared to be lost.

I imagine that you regard this status quo as slavery. Also, limited work-weeks have been around forever. I gather that you regard this as freeloading. And these things ultimately provide for public goods, without any Stalinesque genocides being perpetrated against 'job creators'. At the same time, taxes do not get collected without legally accountable economic activity.<p>Indeed, as productivity increases, we should see benefits such as people not being forced to immediately begin starving in the street because their job became economically unnecessary, and people not being forced to work 80-hour weeks to provide for the profit of somebody else. If overall productivity increases only come with less social security and more compulsory work for one class, that is because another class is applying coercion to steal labor, which is not morally any better than stealing capital.<p>This observation does not require one to be a Bolshevik, nor does it entail that any mass killings will occur. Nor does it involve revolution. The status quo of several decades in the western world is already something of a balance between workers and capitalists. Now you are peddling the idea that this arrangement has been unfair to the capitalists who have been tremendously enriched by it.<p>That isn't correct. It is in the interests of capitalists not to kill and overwork the people whose time is required to produce anything, and not to strangle the average consumers whose spending power drives the economy. The problem is that short-term thinking and ideologues such as yourself are working to convince capital holders otherwise, that they should cash out as quickly as possible without regard to the social impact of what they are doing.<p>That's dangerous thinking and I urge you to become more educated in this area.",1347628045

Slap a prepaid cell phone on it, start up any of the popular webstreaming apps[1], and bam. You're in business.<p>You can fly it to a drop, check the landing space for friendly faces, and hit a back-up spot if things don't look good. Or, if you're good, just fly it into someone's back yard.

4416406,comment,4415799,4416270,7,0,jandrewrogers,,,"MPI is messaging interface rather than a parallelism API. Even in C++ most of the parallelism constructs are a strawman because many high-performance computing codes are written as single-threaded processes locked to individual cores and communicating over a messaging interface of some type. The parallelism is implemented at a higher level than either the messaging interface or the code. Many supercomputing platforms support MPI but not all of them do.<p>The practice of a single process locked to each core communicating over a messaging interface has trickled down to more generic massively distributed systems work because it has very good properties on modern hardware. You end up doing a fair amount of functional programming in this model because multiple tasks are managed via coroutines and other lightweight event models. This architecture is very easy to scale out because it treats every core -- on the same chip, same motherboard, or same network -- as a remote resource that has to be messaged.<p>MPI has one significant problem for massively parallel systems in that it has tended to be brittle when failures occur, and on sufficiently large systems failures are a routine problem. There are ways to work around it but it is not the most resilient basis for communication in extremely large systems. At the high-end of HPC MPI and similar interfaces are commonly used but for many of the next generation non-HPC systems operating on a similar scale they are using custom network processing engines built on top of IP that give more fine-grained control over network behaviors and semantics. This is not faster than MPI and often slower, and tends to be a bit more complex but it allows more robustness and resilience to be built in at a lower level. MPI was designed for a set of assumptions that work for many classic supercomputing applications but which don't match many current use cases.",1345620600

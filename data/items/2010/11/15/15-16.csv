I'm guessing that he feels comfortable with the information he learned from the tax attorney and is satisfied with the help he's received.<p>In regards to the ""reasonable salary"" issue that's a difficult topic to explain because its a subjective test.  The word reasonable is going to be very different for the IRS compared to the average taxpayer.<p>In my experience, a ""reasonable salary"" is going to depend a number of factors.  The best way to prove that you're getting a reasonable salary is to have ""comps"" or comparable positions with the same functions and them take the average of their salary.<p>Ex: Your job description is an entry level developer.  Average salary is in the range of 55k to 75k but the mean is 60k.  In this situation you could argue for any salary between 55k and 75k, but the clearest answer would've been 60k.  Subjectivity please a big role in this area.<p>Also, experience has given me a ""gut feeling"" on what is reasonable so often times I go by just guessing based on what I've seen on the past.<p>Lastly, thanks for the props!

It was meant to be a segue into ""molesters have a new career path"" and contrast this with doctors in general, not to put words in your mouth. Reading it now, I definitely see that I could have worded it better.<p>Regarding your later point, though, those practices aren't ok with me. When I was a teenager, I had some issues that I had to see a urologist about, and he asked me a couple times if he could check my prostate. I refused every time because I was uncomfortable with the procedure (yes, medically I probably should have, but that didn't factor for my 15-year-old-brain). Whether or not its sexual assault, or even assault at all, doesn't really matter. What matters is your perception, and what you would be ok with someone doing to you.<p>I've got a touch of RSI in my right hand. There is a very real possibility that somewhere in the next few decades I may need surgery for it, since I'm a programmer and arm/wrist abuse is pretty much par for the course. If I went for that surgery and was told ""oh, and while I've got you under, I'm going to perform a prostate exam on you"" then I'd definitely be looking for another doctor.<p>Everyone needs to have control over their own body, and there are limits to what we should have to endure.

I have been very lucky to land a job doing what I love. Many of my newly graduated friends are doing service jobs or doing brainless admin tasks in offices. Most are simply unemployed, they cannot bring themselves to settle for these jobs and would rather sit at home on unemployment benefit. Often these jobs only pay one or two pounds more per week than what they are receiving in benefits.<p>The worst thing about this situation is the sense of helplessness and having been lied to it instills in young people. We have been told by our parents, rightly or wrongly, for the first two decades of our lives that if we simply work hard in our education we will land well paid, secure jobs. This was the reward for all the hard work at school, and for all the debt uni now requires. Now these kids are graduating, and finding that their £30000 of debt and three years of hard work might get them a job in macdonalds, if they're lucky.<p>When you combine that with the fact that those responsible for this situation got all their education completely free and were given large grants to pay their way through, you end up with the events of last week: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE3IEKWu4rA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE3IEKWu4rA</a>",1289836097

In the case of amputating a leg against necessity or your will, as a regular 'assault', probably; it's the 'sexual' part that I think doesn't apply.<p>Still, in the case of the prostate exam, I'm not sure there is a criminal legal remedy against it. It's not assault, it's not sexual assault, at best it's a breach of patient-doctor confidence. A civil case, to the best of my knowledge. What kind of 'damage' are you going to claim? Statutory damages (for those in countries where these exist) are not going to help because if it can't be qualified under a statute, there's not going to be much 'statutory damage' either. Mental anguish? Maybe. It's a tough sell to most courts in most of the world though.<p>Doctors may have professional codes of conduct, maybe it's regulated in there, but doctors here in the Netherlands have those too - many of them, being a very regulated country; yet still for years these involuntary examinations were done, without the women knowing even. I see no reason to believe that this situation would be different in every other country of the world; in other words, if it happens in the Netherlands, I would find it logical that the same things happen in other countries. Not all other countries, just some.",1289833643

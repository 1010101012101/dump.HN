3617573,comment,3616820,3616820,15,0,tomdale,,,"As I noted in my lunch talk at Carbon 5 the other day, Ember.js optimizes for developer productivity--which is not to say that you can't have multiple goals, but at the end of the day, one thing has to be your priority.<p>For the past few months, we've prioritized creating an API that is friendly, conceptually simple, and correct. Our view implementation, for example, handles many edge cases that other frameworks might punt on.<p>We believe that nailing the API first is important for a number of reasons. We can increase performance without you having to change your app; the same is not true if we spend time making it fast, then require you to change the API once we realize it is not a good one.<p>The cool thing about declarative systems is that once you express your intent in a way the framework understands, we can apply heuristics and optimizations that every app developer gets for free.<p>Some people pooh-pooh the idea that better abstractions require a ""sufficiently advanced compiler,"" but I think the history of the field has proved that it's the case. V8 and LLVM are examples of projects where we continue to eke out performance increases well past what I think the average person would have expected. I saw the same thing in Handlebars-- a lot of people criticize Handlebars for being separated into multiple steps, as it increases the size of the library somewhat, but being able to reason about each of the steps in the compilation pipeline has given contributors the ability to reason about possible slowdowns and turned it into one of the fastest template libraries around.<p>So, all of that being said, I would never recommend using bindings for animation. I'm not aware of <i>any</i> framework or library that recommends this. Bindings were designed for infrequently changing values that need to be displayed to the user. Since the smoothness of animation is critical to the user experience, it's hard to argue that any optimization is premature optimization. All of the animation we've done in our Ember apps is done via either CSS transitions, or using requestAnimationFrame and modifying the DOM element directly.<p>While Ember.js will presumably always be technically slower than Backbone, slower doesn't have to mean slow. That being said, there are obvious performance gains to be made here, and I'm glad we've got Jeremy to keep us on our toes. :P",1329850197

JSC is developed in the open, everyone can see the work we're doing, and the progress we're making, as we're making it.  If you had actually followed the link you would have seen a change log pointing to a bug on bugs.webkit.org that shows the huge amount of (public) work that preceded actually landing this <a href=""https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75812"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75812</a> .  Additionally there was substantial refactoring in multiple commits leading up to the final landing of LLInt in order to reduce the patch size as much as possible.<p>The reason the LLInt landed as a ""code dump"" is because that is the minimal size possible - you can't land part of an execution engine, as by definition part of an engine is not sufficient to pass tests.  As it is, this is only 32 bit for the simple reason that 32-bit x86 is the easiest way to stress register allocation, our value encoding requires two 32bit registers per value and 32bit x86 has very few registers.<p>TLDR; You can't really do massive codedumps in the webkit repository, the commit rules make it very hard.

One is designed to exploit a weakness in P3P and avoid blatantly lying to browsers in order to track users. The other indicates that PII is used, but does not fully specify how this is used.

These are not just simple tweaks to a fixed pipeline: it is possible to drastically alter the mechanism. As an example: mpm_winnt can be drastically different than the Unix implementations.<p>The original implementation was mpm_prefork, which maintains a pool of fork()'d processes to handle incoming connections. However, the more reasonable installations have used mpm_worker for years now, which keeps a pool of threads in each process (developed back when thread pools were the rage).<p>However, a while back someone built mpm_event, which uses the same underlying system calls that people use to build their ""purely event-driven servers"" to handle the sockets. This has been marked ""experimental"" for a while, initially due to bad interactions with other modules that weren't quite prepared to be evented (such as mod_ssl), but honestly it has been stable for years.<p>(I've been using it in production on a site with tens of millions of users, with SSL, and if anything mpm_event made things run better by working around a really irritating issue in Python: specifically, that until very very very recently the Python libraries simply failed to handle EINTR in a reasonable way; mpm_event seems to setup the signal and thread environment in a way that made me stop getting entire outgoing HTTP API requests to fail with EINTR ;P.)",1329849205

For what it's worth, we're in the process of implementing a feature that would allow you to specify the re-rendering granularity in the template itself, but we don't want it to be heavily used by end-users.<p>""Handlebars vs. Underscore templates -- although Handlebars templates are quite fast.""<p>I don't see the cost of rendering handlebars templates at all in the top of the profile, which is not surprising, as the templates we're rendering are very small, and Handlebars templates are very fast.<p>""Fine-grained bindings needing to be kept in sync inside of Ember for Metamorph.js purposes.""<p>The cost of bindings are not ongoing, but rather when a `set` happens. Internally, this code is somewhat equivalent to the Backbone event system (we even trigger `change:foo` events) with some more chrome on top to manage things like computed properties. Most of the cost here is not in the internals of the binding system, but rather in the effects of the binding system, like re-rendering the `{{content}}` and updating the style.<p>In short, the internals of Ember know about as much on an ongoing basis as Backbone's internals know: namely, that there is an observer on `change:content` that needs to be triggered when the underlying property changes. Again, we do more work once that event is triggered than Backbone does, but the vast majority of the cost is on the receiving end of the events, not in the event system itself.<p>""Other miscellaneous overhead.""<p>From my analysis of the profile, this looks to be the primary cost. The view layer itself could stand to be more optimized. For example, we use a state machine internally to control what events are legal in different states (preRender, inBuffer, hasElement, inDOM). It was our first state machine implementation inside of Ember, and we didn't do some obvious optimizations (like cache legal transitions).<p>The ember-states code, which ships with ember and is used in ember-data, is far more optimized, and moving to use it should eliminate some of the cost I'm seeing. At the very least, it provides us with a central state machine implementation that we can continue to optimize over time, resulting in performance improvements all around.<p>There are other areas where micro-optimizations will almost certainly help (such as in the event system itself and how it's used).",1329848553

My apps Wedding Songs Planner - First Dance and Weddings Songs Planner - Professional are a free and paid version of the same application. This app will help brides and grooms create the perfect playlist for the songs during their wedding.<p>Originally, I had only put out the paid version of the app. After one marketing campaign and few wedding blogs posting about the app I had sales at about 5-10 apps per day. Which is not great by any means, but it was at least fairly consistent. In an attempt to get more downloads and sales, I decided to put out a BIG update to improve the user interface and the overall functionality of the app. Along with this update, I put out a free version of the app with reduced functionality in the hopes of converting some users to buy the paid version.<p>After some issues with Apple accepting the updates, the app was finally updated and released. The problem was that the sales DROPPED
to levels that I hadn't seen since before any blogs had picked it up and some days I was seeing 0 sales. The main points that I could see that might have caused this were:<p>- A name change: Wedding Songs Planner to Wedding Songs - Professional<p>- An icon change: What I had thought was a much improved looking icon but may have blended into App Store more.<p>- Overall look: The overall look was much improved but maybe the audience did not agree.<p>Once the free version was approved I released it in the App Store, sales did not go up. I tried reducing the price to $0.99, sales did not go up. I tried changing the border to red, sales did not go up. I changed the name back to Wedding Songs Planner - Professional which may have helped.<p>The price is back up since the sale did not help increase downloads. I'm hoping the name change was main problem but now that my app has dropped in the App Store it will be hard to bring it back up to where it can be noticed.<p>This is a cautionary story, sometimes when you think something is an improvement, the market doesn't agree.

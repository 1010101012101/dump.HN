275646,comment,275277,275385,0,0,jorgeortiz85,,,"One problem of liberal democracy is that the rhetoric of liberalism and freedom it invokes legitimizes even very questionable practices.<p>Was slavery legitimate because it was approved by a ""liberal democracy""? Or was pre-Civil War (or even pre-Civil Rights) US not a liberal democracy? If it wasn't a liberal democracy back then, were the then-government's actions still legitimate? These questions get at many thorny issues (like reparations, etc).<p>Also, is it legitimate for liberal democratic states to mandate the teaching of intelligent design, prohibit same-sex marriages, etc? Would a constitutional amendment (duly passing the democratic process) banning interracial marriages (or gay marriages) be legitimate?<p>I guess my point is: Do legitimate (i.e., democratic) means justify any ends? The rhetoric of ""liberal democracy"" is so powerful that it can be (and sometimes is) used to justify very questionable practices.",1218671638

To me it's like calling a stone fortress on not being a tent.<p>2.  Anything can be called 'stylistically uniform' if you ignore enough details, and music is all about details.<p>3.  This ""point"" is applied carelessly, merely pairing up random recordings with video seemingly at random and with no taste.  Furthermore, attempt to dismiss something as suitable as ""incidental music"" for movie scenes is hilarious in itself, given the importance music currently plays in movies.",1218670586

275627,comment,274898,274994,0,0,netcan,,,"I think the problem is partly the 'industry's' motivation. Three main reasons for outsourcing are:
1. Do it cheaper.
2. Do it better.
3. Don't want to develop skills internally, grow horizontally, grow at all. I think all these are variations & combinations of 1 & 2.<p>If the motivation is 1, the effect is deep. Firms succeed by being cheapest. They hire, train & develop their employees based on this. The whole industry develops in that direction.<p>Like with Customer Service. Most outsource to save money. Most should outsource because they suck at it.",1218669908

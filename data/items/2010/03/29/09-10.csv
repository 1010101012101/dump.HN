Since he is an internet celebrity, people will use him as a credible source to justify their hiring reasons. Also, the HR filters don't really care what open source you've done in your spare time. They won't have much knowledge on it. They will understand what a Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Yale graduate can bring to the table. But your contribution to Apache won't mean much to the filterer.<p>Now, having personal contact and a network throws all of this out the window. I don't have a CS degree, I've never gotten a job offer without someone having personally reviewed my application. A friend in HR says they use software that looks for competitors (aka work experience), degrees, languages in that order.",1269856729

I'm not a designer or anything, so take with a grain of salt.<p>The design is nice, but has a little bit of a ""thrown together"" look: the different things on the page don't really seem like they belong together.<p>I'd recommend a few things:<p>1. Align the logo of the site to the left (aligned with the text below).<p>2. Since I assume your subscription form at the bottom is <i>not</i> the most important thing, I'd make it much smaller, and move it to the right (someplace more out of the way). Where it is now, it looks like it should be the login form.<p>3. On that note, I'd move the login form to where the subscription form is now, and make it much bigger. Also, I'd probably make the ""new user"" link even bigger than that, since you'll mostly be getting new users for now. I'd probably make it a separate, very large, ""call to action"" button, and center it in the screen (ala Drop Box).<p>4. Last thing: I don't know what plentyoffish.com is, and that's in the first sentence of your site. You really don't want me leaving your site first thing.",1269856028

I have written whole dissertations just by typing the title and then leaving a heavy book on the tab key<i>.<p></i> Different commands lines and editors vary, but in general tab completion will complete the current word/filename/command if it is unambiguous, and provide some kind of listing if it is ambiguous -- so on the bash command line it will beep if it can't complete, but pushing tab twice will then show all the possible completion.",1269855083

No, that doesn't work.<p>If you can't put your finger on what's going on here, you need to first learn what an intransitive verb is.  Then, that ""blog"" is such a verb (from the OS X dictionary, which I assume is based on common usage, seeing that it's such a new word).  ""Sleep"" is another example of such a verb.  You don't sleep the bed any more than you blog the post (or the cow).  That's why we have the word ""write"".<p>Now, would you even say ""How to write insightful"" rather than ""How to write insightful posts""?  Because if you would, you actually want to be saying ""How to write insightfully"" - writing insightfully is the act of writing ""insightful x"", but dropping the x.  You see, they already thought of that.  Grammar acrobatics should be left to people who have a very strong command of the language - it will destroy your writing otherwise.",1269854901

I am guessing that if you go with freemium you are going to get a bunch of people using it who are just adding an FAQ to their freepages 'website' and are unable to or never plan to upgrade to a paid version. The money will probably be in going after big buisnesses, colleges, NPOs, etc. who want to find out what their customer's questions really are.

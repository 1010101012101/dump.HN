3912919,comment,3912149,3912149,5,0,hp,,,"It makes total sense to omit comments, because JSON is optimized for machine-readability and interoperability (simple spec, simple implementation, no extension mechanism, fast to parse). Putting comments in would compromise it for that purpose.<p>JSON isn't a great config file format, if your config file is meant to be human-edited. But the solution is simple; use a format designed for human editing.<p>Config files need UI design too.<p>During Akka and Play 2.0 development, we approached this by starting from the hand-rolled parsers found in Akka 1.2 and Play 1.2 (both had ad-hoc parsers to support a ""pretty"" config file format). We took the aesthetic preferences of the hand-rolled parsers seriously, and came up with HOCON: <a href=""https://github.com/typesafehub/config"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/typesafehub/config</a> (scroll down to ""JSON Superset""), <a href=""https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md</a><p>The HOCON format is a superset of JSON and also happens to be mostly compatible with the Play and Akka 1.2 ad hoc parsers (which were independently developed, so two data points on what people wanted).<p>HOCON is roughly similar to YAML in complexity. Like YAML the spec is pretty long ( <a href=""http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html</a> ). And the Typesafe Config and SnakeYAML jars have pretty comparable amounts of bytecode in them.<p>HOCON or YAML would be terrible formats for an API or something like that, and they're painful to implement, but I strongly prefer them to JSON for human-maintained configuration.<p>Anyway, I think the genius of JSON was its focus on machine interoperability rather than trying to do everything, that's why it works so well for machine interoperability.\nBut it doesn't mean you have to use it for everything.",1335844320

Typesafe Stack with Scala 2.9.2, Akka 2.0, Play! 2.<p><i></i>Where we are now (05:45)<i></i><p>- Scala 2.10 on the horizon, basically feature-complete.<p>- Refinements, testing and release, will happen in the next months.<p><i></i>Scala 2.10 overview (06:20)<i></i><p>- Lots of work on tooling: Eclipse, IntelliJ, ... more features, better performance.<p>- Low-level concurrency framework in the standard library (Futures and Promises), used by both parallel collections and Akka.<p>- Native reflection framework.<p>- A few new language features.<p><i></i>Reflection Framework overview (08:05)<i></i><p>- Cake pattern has a central role, improvements in 2.10 (dependent method types) make it more useful.<p>- Compilers and reflection are quite similar: Both need to deal with the same concepts, answer similar questions.<p>- Differences between compilers and reflection: Where does the information come from?, Generate code vs. invoke pre-generated code, error messages vs. exceptions, thread-safety, (im)mutability of types, ...<p><i></i>Reflection in 2.10, demonstration (12:05)<i></i><p><i></i>Mirror-based reflection (16:50)<i></i><p>- Mirrors return the reflective information of runtime values.<p>- Different mirrors can provide different characteristics.<p>- Types of different mirrors are enforced to be incompatible with each other: Reflects the design of VMs that for instance even the same types on different machines are distinct.<p>- Common supertype allows reasoning about all mirrors.<p><i></i>Implementation of reflection (18:30)<i></i><p>- Functionality for trees, symbols, types, names.<p>- Functionality to decompose and explore relationships between them, ...<p>- Roughly equivalent to the core of the language specification and the core of the compiler.<p><i></i>Comparison with Java (19:15)<i></i><p>- Java has a quite complex typesystem since Generics were introduced.<p>- What is Java approach? Pretty much empty interfaces, no useful methods defined.<p>- Want to do anything non-trivial with types in Java? Write your own compiler/typechecker!<p>- Why was it done this way? Would have required to write essential parts of a compiler (hard) and to make sure both compilers always agree (almost impossible). Smart decision of the Java designers to not suffer this maintenance nightmare.<p><i></i>Scala's approach (22:00)<i></i><p>- Unify the core parts of compilers and reflection.<p>- Compiler architecture: Object-oriented encapsulation, seperation of concerns. Use a cake pattern in which every component has a self-type that contains all its required dependencies (""Slices of the cake"").<p>- How to integrate reflection?<p>- Multiple cakes: compiler cake (`scala.nsc.Global`) and reflection cake (`scala.reflect.runtime.Mirror`) inherit from common super-cake (`scala.reflect.internal.Universe`), which captures common information.<p>- Refactor common functionality into super-cake, let individual cakes handle differences (e. g. compiler cake: IO, reflection cake: thread synchronisation)<p>- Refine super-cake (`scala.reflect.internal.Universe`) by providing a cleaned-up facade to the user on top, `reflect.api.Universe`.<p>- Java's interfaces not enough, Scala leverages abstract types to both present a convenient interface to the user and allow elegant/efficient implementation behind the scenes.<p><i></i>Reflection summary (29:50)<i></i><p>- Scala is a pretty regular language:<p>- Everything can be nested: Classes, methods, objects, types.<p>- Everything can be abstract: Methods, values, types.<p>- Type of `this` can be declared freely to express dependencies.<p>- Enables expression of cake hierarchies for software design in the large.<p><i></i>Macros overview (30:50)<i></i><p>- Once reflection and compilers are unified  what can we do now?<p>- What happens when the compiler itself can make use of reflection?<p>- It can call user-defined methods during compilation, which can consume/produce trees/types.<p>- This leads to a simple macro system, which is included as an experimental feature in Scala 2.10.<p><i></i>Macro definition (32:40)<i></i><p>- Standard Scala methods declaration with all the same rules for overloading/overrididng/... + implementation part which points to a concrete, stable macro implementation. Both have standard Scala method signatures.<p>- Types are lifted from `T` to `Expr[T]`, which can be descriped as an AST which, when run, produces a result of type `T`.<p><i></i>Macro expansion (34:35)<i></i><p>- If the compiler encounters a macro application during type-checking, it will first type-check the arguments (as usual), expand the macro application by doing a reflective call to the macro implementation with the context (call site info) and the AST. Then the macro implementation runs and produces a tree, which will be taken as a replacement of the macro application and type-checked again.<p>Macro example (35:55)<p><i></i>Expressing syntax trees (37:00)<i></i><p>- Scala provides no special/new syntax. Writing down syntrax trees might be cumbersome, but there is actually a better way to do it without introducing special syntax.<p><i></i>Contexts (40:00)<i></i><p>- A macro context contains a mirror (in this case the current compiler instance) that anchors trees, types which are being passed in and out of the macro.<p>- Also contains information about the macro call.<p><i></i>Hygiene (41:25)<i></i><p>- Lot of hard work in the Scheme community in the 80ies to avoid hygiene issues.<p>- Scala's macro system is trivial, does nothing more than accepting trees/types and producing trees again, not hygienic.

Not all systems will be around in 20 years, much less require the types of changes in 20 years that necessitate changing the datastore.<p>I view it as an optimization problem.

Optimize for what is likely.<p>If I'm building an official site for a popular product, I'd bet on all the above being true.<p>Some of what I build, even if 100% of people who could use the product would use it, will run just fine with a single database server that costs in the area of $8k.  Planning for scale out is a complete waste of time here.<p>Most of what I build starts out simple.  Most of what I build starts out with 0 users.  Will it be popular, will it last, will it need to scale?  We have no clue.  For these, we keep it simple: modularize our code based upon features, use our datastores to their fullest within features, and keep in mind how we might scale things out (which may ultimately be incorrect) - if we have to.  Usually we don't have to.  I believe it to be a fair balance in this scenario.<p>Also, given your constraints, I don't quite understand how you could find a future datastore that is a better solution.  How can you exploit better solutions and avoid lockin at the same time?  If a better solution comes along in the future, it seems like you would be using features that would lock your datastore to that newer, better solution.

TBH, programming is and will always will be English centric and I would never feel 100% confident with any software engineer that isn't very proficient in English insofar as reading and writing are concerned. Practically every tome, text, blog or article of any real value in the field is published in English, and only once they are really well known are they translated to other languages. The only time the English speaking programming World is behind that of another language is when a new language is developed by a non-native English speaker (such as Lua developed in Brazil and Ruby developed in Japan). And even then no language would ever see popular adoption to the point of importance if it doesn't adopt English as the language of its source and its documentation.<p>This isn't bigotry. This is just the way things are.<p>FWIW, English isn't my first language, Portuguese is, but I have native fluency in English.",1335841800

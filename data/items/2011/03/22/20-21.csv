2356438,comment,2356189,2356189,0,0,dinde,,,"An even bigger problem than password reuse, in my opinion, is secret question formulas to reset your password. My banking site requires a strong password, which of course means that I often forget it, which means that resetting my password has become a regular part of the login process. The site allows me to reset my password directly from the site after answering my secret questions correctly. It does not send an email link to reset.<p>If a password can be reset by answering a series of secret questions, then the password itself is moot and the account is only as secure as its secret questions. Which in many cases aren't very secure to anyone who might know the person (What is the color of your first car? What is your first pet's name?).<p>Given the choice between being allowed a ""weak"" password that I might actually remember, and a ""strong"" password that I either have to write down or reset every time I log in via answering a series of questions that are even less secure than a weak password, I would take the weak password.",1300827324

I lived 200km downwind from Chernobyl and had to run for cover when it rained first few months. My brother-in-law had his thyroid gland treated when he was 9. Sanitary food inspections still include contamination spot checks, 25 years later.<p>- Oil spills are largely non-argument. Oil is used primarily for gasoline production and has only fringe role in energy production.<p>- There is a great, clean fossil fuel in form of natural gas. It is indeed widely used, in some countries in Europe it accounts for 95% of energy production. Coal vs. nuclear is false dichotomy and mostly serves as rhetorical device of proponents of nuclear.<p>- Safety record of fossil fuel would be much, much higher if as much was invested for safety per TWh as for nuclear. That said, natural gas is still on par with nuclear w.r.t. safety.<p>- With mass adoption of nuclear, which is now mostly concentrated in places with high safety culture, the number and scale of disasters is bound to catch up. Extrapolate the accident trend for growth up to 50% energy share, and it would be more than simply linear.<p>- Waste management. Enough said.<p>- Overall attitude to opponents from nuclear advocates is off-putting.

2356223,comment,2356185,2356185,0,0,ahsanhilal,,,"Interesting question regarding whether Groupon increases or decreases societal welfare. IMO Groupon is an 'excess inventory' business. They find places which have tables, food, drinks, spots free and sell them at deeps discounts to attract customers to fill those spots. So I do not think that is a net increase in welfare by any terms; since they are not producing or consuming anything themselves and are rather just selling something that is already there.<p>Moreover, Groupon thrives because a number of people (mainly small retailers, merchants) are worse off, since they have to suffer the consequences of selling at deep discounts, and it is well documented that these people suffer losses due to a Groupon sale. Small retailers build their customer base mostly on repeat customers. However, with a deeply discounted coupon and non-returning customers, Groupon actually leaves a large number of merchants worse off then they were before. Plus, loss of brand value, and group thinking which leads a lot of people to switch their demand curves and expect the same 'groupon' price for actual items, leads to increased loss of welfare. I guess you can argue that the marginal decrease in the welfare of merchants, is compensated by the marginal increase in the welfare of patrons/customers.<p>So my point being, at best they might have a net zero effect. In most cases, they probably make someone worse off.",1300824554

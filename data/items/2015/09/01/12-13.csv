In fact, for a while I tried to lucid dream and as I watched myself call asleep there would be an instant of sudden clarity. Like a light switch had turned on and whatever I was thinking of would jump into view, fully colored and textured. The difference to the vagueness of my normal imagination was so striking I would jolt awake. Same with sounds; I will get beautiful, complex  music pouring into my head as I drift off. While awake, I hear noises I imagine but instead as if I were making sounds with my throat. I can&#x27;t hear Beethoven but I can hear myself hum the notes even without doing so.<p>So I can say with some confidence that both extremes exist in the literal sense and this is not at all just a matter of describing the same qualia differently.<p>Honestly the questions given in the test don&#x27;t seem to well capture my abilities. I have no ability to recall my own mother&#x27;s face, but I can is of reconstruct it from facts I know (length of her hair, shape of her jaw, anything I&#x27;ve noticed explicitly). I get sensations of colors in short bursts if at all, it is not a dimness.  And motion,  rotations, and spatial relations feel real to me even if I can&#x27;t see them. When it tells me to imagine a rainbow I don&#x27;t see color, but I feel it&#x27;s arc in the sky, even trace it mentally with imaginary hands. That aspect is not dim and vague.

If you find someone trying to criticize your achievement as being &quot;just because you are privileged&quot; say<p>&quot;I&#x27;m now further from where I started, than where I started was from where you started. So if you couldn&#x27;t even make it from where you started to where I started, how do you expect that you could have made it from where I started to where I am now?&quot;<p>People may choose to respond to this by saying something that confirms their idea that they are fundamentally more worse off than you. They may call you privilege blind. They may say it is easier if they had X more capital. The may say anything that confirms their hypothesis that without having whatever they credit you with possessing, they are less capable.<p>I implore you, be not discouraged, nor believe your success any the lesser. Recognize that they are disempowering themselves and, that by believing that success is something that must be given to them rather than something they create, they are acting privileged and entitled, the very things they are trying to say you are. Recognize and, if you like, benevolently point out, that this chosen self-disempowerment, this unworkable attitude, is a poverty of the spirit that will disadvantage them ( by their own choice ) far more than any difference between how much they started with, and how much you did.<p>For if at every step of the way, people are looking to those who have more than them and, &quot;proving&quot; to themselves that this difference was all about different starting points rather than about a different sequence of choices, then such people are disempowering the power of choice, and, how likely do you feel such people will be, to ever make a string of choices that leads to success?<p>No, friends, heed not their admonishments, and keep your children away from their siren songs, for they are only the delusional whispers of a people soothing themselves into apathy by telling themselves they never coulda, instead of believing that they fully could have, had they only chosen to take responsibility for success, instead of deluding themselves that it was owed to them.<p>To put it in more general terms : Being a fake victim doesn&#x27;t work, you just disempower yourself. When you see people better of than you, choosing to be inspired and to acknowledge their achievements works. Choosing to pretend to yourself that success is something that must be given to you, instead of something you create yourself, is just acting privileged and entitled, and it doesn&#x27;t work and it actually, this attitude, makes it less likely for you to succeed. An attitude that acknowledge the choices that lead to success, and that takes responsibility yourself to create your own success through your own choices, this attitude works, and makes it more likely for you to succeed. Anything else, any stories you choose to tell yourself about how it&#x27;s so unfair, is just you choosing to substitute the fake payoff of feeling like a righteous fake victim of unfairness, for the real payoff of actually creating results.<p>Trying to spread to others the claptrap that people are powerless, so you can confirm your own delusions that they are, is just incorrectly trying to disempower others, and it&#x27;s just wrong.<p>TL;DR -- Deluding yourself that success is given, rather than created, is not an attitude that works to help you create your own success.<p>I hope this cleared some things up for some people. Those too far gone in excusing themselves a lack of success due to a fantasy of disadvantage may or may not be beyond the reach of such simple words, and I hope they can be reached. For everyone else I have even more hope.<p>Keep the faith, it is up to you.",1441110964

For the sake of simplicity I&#x27;ll leave out any mixed forms for now.<p>In the former case I&#x27;d take a lot of bandwidth and traffic burden from the central server but would force each client to have [clients-1] connections and send the same stream to each of them. Encoding itself shouldnt be the big problem here but it would consume a lot more of bandwidth (and subsequently traffic) than when routed via the server.<p>In the latter case I&#x27;d avoid aforementioned drawbacks but not only would it increase the server&#x27;s own traffic bill dramatically but it would also increase latency as everything would get sent to the server and then back to the clients.<p>Is there any commonly accepted approach or best practice for such a setup?",1441110077

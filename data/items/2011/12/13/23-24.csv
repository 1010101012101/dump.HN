3349910,comment,3349670,3349670,47,0,cheald,,,"The increase in debugging complexity is a fair point, and it does add an extra step in between finding a problem and fixing it. However, in practice, I'm not sure I've ever had this be a <i>major</i> problem; I've had more problems related to bad error messages from the Coffeescript compiler (generally due to significant-whitespace errors) than I have had in trying to associate Javascript to its source Coffeescript.<p>The rest of the examples, though, don't hold much water. The takeaway from them is ""it's possible to write terribly-factored code, even in a pretty language"".<p><pre><code>    doSomething() if five and six and seven\n</code></pre>\nCan be rewritten as this, if it's more comfortable for you:<p><pre><code>    if (five && six && seven) then doSomething()\n</code></pre>\n!=, &&, ||, (), and the like are still usable in Coffeescript. If it makes the code easier to read, then use them!<p>The whole concern with list comprehension syntax order is sort of a red herring - it works that way in Javascript 1.8, as well! In fact, nearly every language that implements list comprehension does it similarly. 160-column 1-liners are evil in any language, not just Coffeescript. If you don't like the ""method, loop, condition"" syntax of list comprehensions, that's a problem with list comprehensions, not with Coffeescript.<p>The points about the implicit returns and parentheses-less calls apply, as well. When it makes sense to explicitly use them for code clarity, <i>use them</i>.<p>For example, your confusing getUser method can be easily written as:<p><pre><code>    getUser = (id) ->\n      url = ""users/#{id}""\n      dfd = $.ajax(\n        url: url\n        format: 'json'\n        method: 'get'\n      )\n      return { url: url, promise: dfd.promise() }\n</code></pre>\nVoila, it's still coffeescript, and it's very readable, easy to understand, and not at all difficult to maintain.<p>The fat arrow, like the rest of the examples, is yet-another-case of ""Yes, you can shoot yourself in the face with it, if you abuse it"". Event binding isn't the only case when you need to preserve scope! Sometimes (frequently, even) you need to pass around an anonymous function bound to a specific scope. The fat arrow is explicitly for that sort of work. If you abuse it every time you could otherwise just call call() or apply() (because you have access to the scope to invoke the function on, in addition to the function itself), then yeah, it's bad.<p>Have you even <i>looked</i> at the implementation of $.proxy() used in your examples there? Guess what it does? It creates a new anonymous function, binds it to the passed-in scope, and returns it. Which is <i>exactly</i> what the fat arrow does in Coffeescript. Why is it evil in Coffeescript, but okay in jQuery? Because you aren't aware it's happening?<p>Your ""This is how you should do it"" method in Coffeescript is wrong. It should be something like this:<p><pre><code>    widget =\n      attach: ->\n        @el.bind 'click', @handler\n      handler: (event) =>\n        doStuffWithThis()\n</code></pre>\nThat's clearer than any of your examples, Just Works, doesn't have a jQuery dependency, and is even less code than your corrected example. First-class functions have the `this` problem in <i>every</i> language, and the fat arrow is very nice syntactic sugar for what you have to do anyway.<p>The purpose of Coffeescript is to make your life as a Javascript developer easier. If you're using it to make your life harder, you're doing it wrong. It's not a case against using Coffeescript - it's a case against writing terrible code.",1323819830

Take drunk driving: a fixed threshold of blood alcohol content (0.08) is a rather crude threshold and takes little account of individual driving performance, but it would be expensive and time-consuming to objectively measure every motorist's baseline performance, degree of impairment, and so on in every case involving DUI. It's already difficult in that smart lawyers will challenge the accuracy and correct configuration of the breathalyzer equipment - as they should - and drivers who test just barely over the limit can often be acquitted or have their charges dropped. On the plus side, the arbitrariness of the threshold not only simplifies prosecutions where users are clearly very far over it, it also dissuades people from approaching the threshold by discouraging them from drinking and driving at all; thus the perception that a DUI charge is a big headache acts effectively to discourage the unwanted behavior. The fact that alcohol intake is objectively measurable, even if impairment is not, provides clarity about both the nature of the proscribed behavior and the risk of liability if one engages in it.<p>Interestingly, it appears that states where medical marijuana is legal see a lower rate of fatal traffic accidents; stoned drivers are thought to be more cautious than normal, and over-compensate for their psychomotor impariment by driving more slowly and waiting longer at stop signs: <a href=""http://hometestingblog.testcountry.com/?p=17893"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hometestingblog.testcountry.com/?p=17893</a>",1323819520

They don't pay themselves salaries, live off their savings and their credit cards. An 'incubator' may give them some cash to pay for things like AWS instances and filing incorporation papers. They may be up to 5 or 6 people before they have a 'minimum viable product' (MVP) and are willing to pitch it to VCs for a real series A.<p>The author points out that all of the first 3, 4, 5, or 6 people who were working to get the company to the MVP point, <i>they are founders.</i> Not just the 'idea guy' or the 'wizard' that they snagged to help implement the idea. Everyone who came on board before series A has made it possible to get to that point is a founder.<p>And yet there are companies that treat person 2 - n as 'employees' and give them way less equity. Because of that people don't want to be employee 2-n, and thus hiring them is 'hard'.<p>I've noticed this as well, and have been puzzling around with the following thoughts.<p>Lets say you create a company and decide that prior to series A, 80% of the company will be owned by the founders and 20% to outside investors. You start with 10 shares, 2 for an angel, 8 for the founder.<p>Now you add a founder, you double the share pool and now you give 8 to the new founder and 2 to the angel (distribution is 4 + 8 + 8). Now you add another engineer/founder and you now add 80 shares to the pot and distribute them 27 + 27 + 26 for the founders and 20 for the angel. Add a new angel and you double the shares to 200 where each angel get (20 + 20) and founders get (54 + 53 + 53) shares.<p>The idea being to keep the ownership percentage of the company 20% angels, 80% workers.<p>Now you go for series A - my thought is you pick three ratios, investors/founders/employees. That may end up being 49/31/30. Allow your angel to either contribute their shares to the series A (cash out) or to participate. But at the end of the day the representation is 49,31,30. Same deal when you add more investors, add to the size of their pool so that works, add to the other pools to keep it balanced.<p>I am undecided if it would make managing the equity table easier or harder.",1323818829

In fact, some things worked even better than on Windows/Mac--he was able to use my printer without installing any drivers; my roommate last year had to spend several hours and get somebody else to help him to print from his Mac.<p>Apart from the difficulty of installing, most people don't even realize that they <i>can</i> install a different operating system--they believe that whatever they have is a magical part of their computer.

Microsoft has had a history of anti-competitive behavior in regards to Linux, and goes out of its way to strong arm OEMs into only supplying Windows; both companies ruthlessly market that Linux is not an option--the false Mac vs PC dichotomy is a perfect example.<p>However, even if Linux isn't particularly popular, it <i>already</i> delivers the most compelling desktop and laptop environment to those who bother installing it; in that sense, it is already the year of the Linux desktop--I can be more productive on Linux than my friends on Windows and Mac OS; if less people use it, well, it's just less competition ;)",1323818602

And let's say you need 25-50k for 2 founders to live for a year. Giving yourself a 12 month runway you're at needing 150-300k in the bank to even be in the position to hire.<p>If you have 150k in the bank it's because you have some seed money, or have bootstrapped your way to that position. If you've bootstrapped then you've achieved pretty good product/market fit and have good revenues. Conversely if you've raised 150k and haven't achieved product/market fit, then you probably shouldn't be hiring.<p>Now, if you look at companies that have raised 150-300K I don't think you'll find many of them hiring, at least not very aggressively. I feel that level of money is used to give the founders time to iterate until product/market fit and not be cash constrained when it comes to things like contracting a good designer or buying a domain. And once a seed funded company achieves some semblance of product/market fit they go and raise 1-2 million.<p>So is this article intended for the few companies that have raised in the 100-300K range that are starting to hire? If that's the case then ya, I agree such a company is going to have difficulty hiring. They have significant risk of not achieving product/market risk, and they don't have sufficient capital to give a fair market wage. So a potential employee is taking a huge chance on such a company, and should obviously be compensated for that (relative to the very attractive compensation packages are companies like Yammer, Square, etc).

I have two goals with this: to provide a better photo sharing option for those who want to own their photos and to build a viable business around it.<p>Once it's done and open sourced the first goal will be met. Then I want to focus on providing the service in a hosted model similar to wordpress.com. It will be free to use but there will be premium services you can pay for.<p>Open sourcing it also fosters competition. If someone else wants to build an Instagram clone that ties directly to your S3 bucket then they can easily do it using the language bindings provided by OpenPhoto or opt to use the OpenPhoto API as a proxy.<p>All your photos in your bucket regardless of the service you use.<p>Let me know if you have any suggestions or questions.",1308005995

So I start up LogMeIn on my Nexus S, remote into my pc and quickly download the album.  Once the album finished downloading, Google Music picked it up and started to upload it to its own service.  In less than 5 minutes, and over 250 miles away from my home PC, I had this particular album on my phone ready to be played on my car stereo.  That to me is absolutely incredible, and I think it really highlights where Apple is starting to fumble with the iPhone in comparison to some of Android's features.",1308005874

The only way to perform an OS upgrade with the iPhone is to do a device sync. If iOS 3.0 has been mostly eliminated, that means that the iPhone 4 must command at least 50% of the iPhone market -- probably much more.

Some very smart investors who have done _actual_ analysis of Groupon (including the team that did due diligence for Google when they made the buyout offer earlier this year) clearly have at least some faith in these CLV numbers.<p>All of the ""armchair analysis"" you see here -- including your opinion on the subject -- is looking at a snapshot of Groupon from their S1 backward. That's fine but if you want to leave pro forma out of it, but then quit making pro forma statements about the failure and decay of the business!<p>All businesses are a money-multiplier machine, right? What you're complaining of is that by your analysis, that multiplier for Groupon is 0.72. Not a very good money machine at all really.<p>Suppose that when you factor in the CLV, that multiplier falls into the range you'd expect from a company that has low variable product costs and a large sales team: 1.21.<p>If you run that company, once you have enough data to really believe in the efficacy of those numbers, then you're going to do everything you can to purchase as many customers as possible. And if you're an investor, you're going to encourage management to do just that.<p>I mean, this is the very handbook on non-seed startup investing.

I can't think of a place to get a better sampling of developers right off hand. Certainly, while Hacker News is popular among developers, it would be a less accurate sampling of developers than Stack Overflow, because people here tend to be attracted to startups.<p>I disagree with what you said in your first post, that it is <i>completely wrong</i>, and that <i>no valid conclusion that can be taken from these numbers</i>. It's not perfect but it's far from being a terrible sample. It's a general-interest developer site rather than a specific-interest one. There are all types of developers. In a reverse-sorted list of popular recent tags, there are c#, javascript, php, java, jquery, .net, and android. Also, developers didn't choose to be a part of this graph; they merely got put into the survey result because they had Stack Overflow accounts. If it had been a survey that was announced on twitter it would be biased towards people who want to take surveys. This would be a worse bias IMO than people who want to ask and answer technical questions.<p>I wouldn't take issue if you had said it was problematic, but instead you went straight to a one-sided conclusion.",1308004628

We could certainly debate the results of a study that polled a few thousand developers between the ages of 20 and 60 and asked them to self evaluate themselves with developers older, the same age, or younger than them. Except we don't have that study, do you know of one ?<p>Paul's essay is a good one on open mindedness, and it gives great examples of how people can over-turn or distance themselves group-think by seeking out the unthinkable.<p>I certainly cannot claim to know what you are thinking but it reads like you think that labelling older developers as lazy, self-deluded, parasites is an example of giving voice to something that is 'true' but 'unsayable' because of some sense of societal impropriety.<p>I can't really comment on whether or not its 'true' because I've not seen any process where that question has been analyzed. The data from the Stack Overflow study says that people who self-report as older on Stack Overflow give more answers and have higher karma as a result.

Or are you trying to argue that your youth and mad social skillz has permanently elevated you above the skill set of people who came before you?<p>I'm not critical of either view, I'm just trying to understand the data that leads to it.

It is quite possible for Motorola to be breaking their commitments to FRAND licensing it just isn't going to be tested in this case. [I agree with the rest of your comment.]<p>I'm going to read the article now but even if you are right then that is <i>really bad news</i> for the world as owners of standards essential patents have the power to bring whole industries to gridlock and to demand massive sums for patent licensing.<p>Edit: I've read it now.  As i read it there is nothing that closes the question of whether Motorola is breaching it's <i>contract</i> with ETSI.  The judge doesn't want to spend time to decide a FRAND value if that doesn't close the case (because Apple aren't committed to pay the price).  I stand by my point that this does nothing to decide whether Motorola has breached their commitments.  I didn't see any comment regarding anti-trust law from this judge and I don't know if that topic was <i>ever</i> on the table in this case.",1353084983

I'm all for fines if they're found using unlicensed drivers.  I guess I don't know that it's necessary to double drug test the drivers though.  I don't think the issue here is filling out a permit, I think it's a matter of ""what does that mean"".

We take :55 - :05 of the hour off to do whatever (check emails, talk to each other, eat a sandwich, workout, etc), but what has increased productivity for us the most so far is scheduling out our day hour-by-hour the night before. Combining that with the rigid :55-:05 break schedule has really kept us on track (not a single dev delay since we started). I think it's the combined effect of having to plan out your tomorrow at night (forcing you to think about priorities, rather than guiding by gut), and the fact that when you're working during the day, you don't need to take any time to figure out what to do next--all you have to do is look at your calendar. We've been incredibly focused and on-target as a result, so if you're looking for another productivity hack I'd try that :)<p>Edit: another positive side effect of scheduling out your day is the fact that it forces you to get really, really good at setting personal expectations, and it helps you be more realistic about what you can accomplish in 50 minutes.

Removing a small cancerous lump might only require keyhole surgery, while in later stages it might require significantly more invasive surgery. Sure, all surgery carries some risk (much of which, I believe, comes from having to use anesthetics rather than the surgery per-se) but the less invasive it is, the faster the patient can recover from it. Similarly, early stage cancers might call for far less agressive chemotherapy drugs with reduced side-effects and requiring fewer doses.<p>Still, the question of early detection is an interesting one, as is the question of when intervention is necessary. Your comments about the stress of knowing that you might have cancer is interesting in light of a paper which my father published a few years ago about whether to restart treatment with people who had relapsed ovarian cancer when their tumour marker levels started rising again, or when they started to exhibit symptoms. As it turned out, while treating people once their tumour markers crossed a 'red line' meant that intervention started earlier, waiting for symptoms to be exhibited resulted in nearly identical life expectancy and also a higher quality of life as they'd spent less time on chemo. Consequently, it also raised the question of whether or not it's worth regularly checking tumour marker levels after their first cancer had gone into remission, as having to have blood tests every three months and waiting for results each time is stressful in itself.",1353083743

This issue is not fixed by any XP service packs. Users must manually install a QFE (Quick Fix Engineering).<p>It should be noted that including the version of the library in the filename has been a simple solution that's been used in Unix since the early '90s, when shared libraries become fashionable.

By ""automatically"", I mean that they do it by virtue of their physical placement and construction, without any need for computer control.<p>In distinguishing between brushed and brushless motors, I was concentrating on (1).  Brushed motors are simpler, but have flexing metal strands which rub, causing friction and wear.  In my mind, this is the primary reason to move from brushed to brushless motors.  Now, in <i>addition</i>, when you remove brushes (and make the central spinning magnet a permanent magnet rather than electromagnet) you also get a chance to manually control the switching of the power--per (2)--to the fixed, exterior electromagnet.

I especially like the macro aspect.<p>To qualify my remarks: I would not propose that anyone takes several images manually or a photographer moves the camera around physically as an alternative.<p>I'm suggesting that competitors (mainstream cameras) could take multiple pictures in rapid succession INTERNALLY (very feasible in lower resolutions). The canon 7D can take videos at 720p @ 60FPS. Higher framerates seem likely in the future. Once one reaches 120FPS, slight variations in the focus whilst shooting 1s of video would result in acceptable shutter speeds (1//120th) for most moving objects and (theoretically) a stack of 120 pictures with different focal points that could be ""merged"" into a ""lytro-like"" image through in-camera focus-stacking and some ""hotspot"" mechanism.<p>Similarly (but less likely) combined with a quick physical circular movement of the sensor, or a lens element (just imagine a ""Lytro-lens"" for your Canon) would allow us to emulate (match?) the other effect.<p>Perhaps no movement is needed at all if the Canon Lytro Lens had an internal ""microlens"" array that subdivided the existing sensor, or uses the ""pattern filter"" technique.<p>My point: Lytro is nice, but has limited usability (for me at least) and I see it merely as a stepping stone towards inclusion of similar features in the mainstream.

They can enumerate specific risks, make general predictions about which risks are more likely to hit them than others, and estimate the costs that would be incurred should such a hit happen. This indicates that the person has been around the block a few times and knows how to differentiate between large, real, business-killing risks and more theoretical ones.<p>The opposite approach is to make bold statements like ""no matter what happens, I'm going to make and deliver high quality shirts"" with an obligatory disclaimer like ""small hiccups will happen"" tacked on afterwards. This communicates that you're aware that risks exist, but not what exactly they are, or which ones are the most dangerous to your business.

Surgery, radiation therapy and chemo-therapy are very invasive techniques, doing huge amounts of damage to a person's body as well as to the cancerous cells.  It very often is the case that the cure is worse than the disease.  Early detection also submits people to the huge mental stress of thinking that they're going to die soon.<p>And that's the case even if the early detection techniques were perfect.   They aren't, far from it.   They have a significant false positive rate.  Many people who don't have cancer are subjected to the mental and physical stresses of cancer treatment.   They then think that this treatment saved their lives, so they say to everybody they know:  go get tested!<p>The other problem is the prevalence of cancer.  80% of men in their 70s have prostate cancer.   Some of them will die from it, but most will die from heart disease or another cause.

A couple things aren't allowed, and some other things now are allowed and don't need to be escaped. Why people think users should type e-mail addresses in RFC822 escaping and not RFC821 escaping makes no sense to me.<p>However, the real punchline is: why are you asking users to enter e-mail addresses escaped at all? If you have an HTML form, for example, you don't need to escape them, as there is no higher-level protocol in which they are being embedded: the box can contain any characters that are needed, and there are no concepts like MIME comments, etc..<p>Asking a user to escape their e-mail address in that box is as silly as asking them to escape their username or password according to HTML or URL or some other escaping rules. Or, imagine if they had to enter their full name, but escaped using MIME encoded words... =?iso-8859-1?Q?=A1Hola,_se=F1or!?= makes about as much sense as escaping your e-mail address.<p>My original comment, which contains many more details about which specific RFCs are involved and what they mean, along with specific examples where things can get different, and a discussion of the context, here:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4486872"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4486872</a>",1353082094

We find a remarkably strong impact of colonial European settlement on development. According to one illustrative exercise, 47 percent of average global development levels today are attributable to Europeans. One of our most surprising findings is the positive effect of even a small minority European population during the colonial period on per capita income today, contradicting traditional and recent views. There is some evidence for an institutional channel, but our findings are most consistent with human capital playing a central role in the way that colonial European settlement affects development today.[1]<p>but emigration from Europe/US is not really related to immigration to the Europe/US.

Since android has some closed core components, and IOS is mostly closed, this is what they are trying to free similarly to what they did with IE. I am optimistic about it.",1353081601

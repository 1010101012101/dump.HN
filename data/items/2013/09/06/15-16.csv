For a while I lived in China and could speak the Beijing dialect well enough to get to know someone and engage in small talk about the NBA.  I took a train trip from Beijing to Lanzhou which is like 1500 km west.  My buddies and I got off the train and couldn&#x27;t understand a lick for the first 2 days.<p>Then there&#x27;s southern China which speaks Cantonese, which is about 100 million people give or take.",1378483198

6341027,comment,6340529,6340839,7,0,chriswarbo,,,"Trampolining is one way to implement &quot;tail call optimisation&quot;. This basically means that when the last instruction (the &quot;tail&quot;) of a function is a call to another function (possibly the same one, recursively), then we can perform an optimisation: rather than &quot;going down&quot; into the function (adding a new stack frame) we can run it where we already are (in our current stack frame). This optimisation is possible because we know that we don&#x27;t need our current stack frame anymore, since this is the last instruction.<p>Ever find yourself writing a &quot;main loop&quot; full of unrelated code which only appears in the same place because you&#x27;re forced to keep it all between the loop&#x27;s braces? That&#x27;s a prime candidate for mutual recursion, made safe using tail-call optimisation:<p><pre><code>  var foo = function() {\n    //\n  };\n  var bar = function() {\n    //\n  };\n  var baz = function() {\n    //\n  };\n  var main = function() {\n    while (true) {\n      foo();\n      bar();\n      baz();\n    }\n  };\n  main();\n</code></pre>\nCan be replaced with:<p><pre><code>  var foo = function() {\n    //\n    bar();\n  };\n\n  var bar = function() {\n    //\n    baz();\n  };\n\n  var baz = function() {\n    //\n    foo();\n  };\n  foo();\n</code></pre>\nThis is how I tend to write Javascript; although I generally handle tail-call optimisation by using setTimeout(foo, 0), which has the same effect.",1378482656

For instance:<p><i>&quot;...if we do not demand that everybody contribute to their full potential, then we notice a massive creative lag in that society.&quot;</i><p>Is this axiomatically true? On what criteria do we draw those comparisons? Where are the data?<p>I&#x27;m not arguing against gender <i>equality</i>, but rather, I am skeptical of socially forced gender <i>equivalence</i>. Those two notions are often conflated, and up until the end of his piece, the author did a pretty good job exploring the distinction. It is one thing to say that men and women can contribute equally, and that they deserve the opportunity to do so equally. It is quite another to say that men and women must be fully <i>interchangeable</i>, and that society is better off when they are.<p>I have no doubt women and men are equally capable, equally creative, and deserve equal freedom to contribute to society in any ways they see fit. But key to that premise is the role of <i>choice</i>, and how we define &quot;contribution.&quot;<p>When we speak about &quot;demanding&quot; that men and women &quot;contribute to their full potential,&quot; we are actually committing an act of inadvertent sexism. We are stigmatizing women who choose to fulfill what we&#x27;d now call &#x27;traditional&#x27; gender roles. Our society needs moms (it also needs dads!). The decision to raise a great family is every bit as noble, and should be every bit as respected, as the decision to become a CEO. It&#x27;s equally hard work, too.<p>A tale from personal experience:<p>My parents are basically Marge and Homer Simpson. My mom, a gifted polymath with a Masters degree from Berkeley, was pursuing a noteworthy career in journalism before she met my dad. My dad was a lovable goofball whose primary interests included watching sports, TV, and movies, and whose near-complete lack of common sense was equal parts endearing and unfathomable.<p>My dad was the sort of person who&#x27;d drive me the school in the morning, then suddenly veer off-course and take me to a Dodgers game. My mom was the sort of person who&#x27;d pick me up from school, and when I got home, would introduce me to Tolkien, Dahl, Hawking, and Shakespeare.<p>In theory, my mom could have &quot;contributed more creatively&quot; to society by pursuing her career full-bore. But she decided -- and it was fully her decision -- to make me and my siblings her primary contributions. And because of her, we ended up more like Lisa than like Bart.<p>To be fair, my dad had stumbled into a considerably more remunerative line of work than my mom -- but I emphasize stumbled. My mom could have run circles around him in the corporate world, had she wanted to. Instead, she chose me. I could live a hundred more years and still not accomplish enough to repay her.",1378481545

If everyone&#x27;s vehicle had been fitted with technology that detected reduced traction due to the greasy road surface, how close vehicles in front really were and how abruptly they were slowing down even if fog was obscuring them, and how fast each driver&#x27;s own vehicle was really going, and if a HUD had then flashed up the essential information and highlighted the insufficient stopping distances drivers were leaving, there might have been many fewer injuries, much less damage, and much less disruption treating the injured and recovering disabled vehicles. While yesterday&#x27;s weather conditions were unusually severe for the UK, similar arguments would apply all the time at night for anyone driving on high speed or bendy out-of-town roads.<p>On the other hand, was I the only person who watched that video and got completely distracted by the zooming route map towards the end? If I were driving for real, I think it would be very difficult to concentrate properly on the road ahead with all of that activity going on. Avoiding information overload and maintaining driver concentration seem like serious concerns for this kind of system, but as a UI guy it looks like an awesome project to work on.",1378480003

And I think for many large websites it ahs become common to build websites out of many small apps, which run on different ports and which Nginx then knits together.<p>An example. Assuming you have the domain example.com then you might have an app that handles user login and you spin that up on, say, port 30000 and you map it to port 80 such that is appears as:<p><a href=""http://www.example.com/login"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.example.com/login</a><p>You might also have an app that handles user signups which you spin up on port 30001 and you map to port 80 such that it appears as:<p><a href=""http://www.example.com/signup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.example.com/signup</a><p>You might also have an admin app that you spin up on port 30002 and you map to<p><a href=""http://admin.example.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://admin.example.com/</a><p>You might also have an app that allows users to update their profile information and you spin that up on port 30003 and map that to<p><a href=""http://www.example.com/profile"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.example.com/profile</a><p>And you might have an app that publishes much of your content as static HTML files, which you spin up on no port, as it does not accept TCP/IP requests  instead it queries the database and then creates static html files, which you save to some directory such as /var/www/example.com/public_html/ and you map that to<p><a href=""http://www.example.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.example.com/</a><p>You can see how this gives the sysadmins a lot of freedom to spread load across servers in creative ways  if 1 app becomes especially popular, or resource hungry, the sysadmins can rather easily move it to its own server (or set of servers). This is one of the main reasons most big sites move to an architecture like this  it facilitates fine grained control of what sort of requests go to a particular server.<p>This is a flexible style and it allows small, maintainable apps. By contrast, consider web development circa 2001, when many people felt it was enough to put a big blob of PHP in a directory and let Apache serve it as one big app.<p>Nginx&#x27;s fast reverse proxy allows developers to focus on building their apps, without having to worry too much the server details. It also offers a cleaner separation between concerns that should worry programmers and concerns that should worry the sysadmins.<p>(A final point: in my own apps, for information that needs to be shared quickly across apps, like which users are logged in, I use ZeroMQ to knit the apps together.)",1378479990

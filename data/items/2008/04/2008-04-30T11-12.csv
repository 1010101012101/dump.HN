This was obviously politically motivated and not very smart as we now see. It did result in a credit bubble. But to claim that it was done to benefit a few 'well-connected' financiers is populism to my opinion. It was done to avoid discontent among people. To appease the masses, so to say...<p>Interestingly, it is the capitalists who are suffering now, as their equity is eroded by inflation, weak dollar and the bear stock market. The average Joe just defaults on his debts and walks away from his 3 year old house. His creditors take the loss. So it is actually a wealth transfer from the rich to the poor.",1209555952

177412,comment,177359,177359,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>I have proposed before to organizations that they implement a non-management technical track all the way to the CxO level, because it’s a lot cheaper to keep your best people on salary than to hire them (or their equivalents) back as consultants at 2x to 6x their salaries. Such a track might look like this: Associate Engineer -> Engineer -> Senior Engineer -> Technical Officer -> Senior Technical Officer -> Executive Technical Officer -> Chief Technical Officer (only one of these). The ranks from Technical Officer and up would have salaries, perks, and benefits equivalent to progressing through management (VP, Senior VP, Executive VP), but without actual management/head count responsibilities.</i><p>I like this idea a lot.  It certainly sounds like a reason to continue working for one company.",1209553755

177409,comment,176866,176866,0,0,glymor,,,"> most talented software developers tend to not stick around at one place for too long<p>If this is true then it's a recent development caused by changes in companies behaviour rather than anything intrinsic to engineers.<p>If you look at Bell Labs, HP, even Microsoft back in the day, engineers stayed there forever. The perennial example would be Steve Wozniak not wanting to leave HP.<p>What has changed since then is perhaps that companies now only do one thing and then specialize their people even beyond that. You need to allow some variation in work or anyone would get tired of it and leave. Even Google falls foul of this, you can change and work on any project as long as it uses the same infrastructure and is a web application, this doesn't compare well to Bell labs.<p>Most programmers are not ambitious by normal standards and tend to be risk adverse. As long as you don't make their job deeply boring or annoying they will literally never leave.",1209553237

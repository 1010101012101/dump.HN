2509135,comment,2508768,2508768,1,0,alderssc,,,"I recommend The Apology of Socrates and The Republic, both written by Plato.<p>The former because it's an excellent introduction to one of the west's most influential figures (Socrates). As a testament to that influence, any philosopher before him is called 'pre-Socratic'. Not to mention Socrates' tale of traveling around Athens questioning the populace after visiting the Oracle is a great story. It wouldn't hurt to follow up with the dialogue Phaedo next, which details the end of Socrates.<p>The latter for many reasons. The Republic is the most complete statements of Plato's philosophy, in addition to being beautifully written (Plato's writing seems to shine through in just about any translation that I've seen, but the Allan Bloom translation is particularly enjoyable).<p>Plato, and this book in particular, have been extremely influential in western thought. Indeed, one philosopher wrote that ""the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato."" And here in America, the founding fathers often quoted Plato in their pamphlets prior to seceding.<p>Following the dialogues in the book will take you from discussions on the nature of justice and reality, to the best mode of governance. It serves as a wonderful introduction to what it means to do philosophy and hopefully you find it as enjoyable as I have.",1304402211

It suggests that any thought you have in isolation is by definition ""unique"". But unfortunately that's not the case. How many times have you said to a friend, ""You know what would be awesome?!?! If we built <blah>"", and they say, ""oh you mean like <blah>?"", ""D'OH!"".<p>You'd be mad to go about building something without first testing that there is a market for what you're building, or that that market isn't already well served. You can't do either of those things without researching your topic of interest. It's all well and good to build that feature you've always dreamed of, but unless anybody else in the world wants it, what's the point?<p>Finally, to suggest that drawing on your own experience is ok, is just contradictory. If you're an expert in a certain field, how can you possibly expect to isolate yourself from everything in that field? This would suggest the only way to be original is to only work in fields you don't understand or have experience.<p>But then maybe I missed the point of the post :)",1304401741

It will give a summary as well as a detail of the items they are assigned to.<p>Obviously, this is all predicated on accurate assumptions on your part as to how long something takes.<p>What you may find easier at first, is to allocate resources to tasks at a higher level in order to build out the project, for example, you may want to assign the ""IT TEAM"" ""<i>Setup Server Environment</i>"" as a multi day task, say 1W -- then assign ""DEVELOPMENT TEAM"" a multi day task, ""SETUP DEV ENVIRON""<p>Then underneath these, break out the subtasks ""SETUP WEB SERVER, 1-day"" ""SETUP DB SERVER 1 day"" etc...<p>Work your way through the tasks refining the time allocation each iteration, based on input from the team.<p>You should save out these setup processes out to re-use them as you move forward.<p>When you get status from a team member on the completion of an item, ask them how long it actually took.<p>If they have 2 days allotted to setup a server, but they wait till the end of the second day and the setup only takes 2 hours... you need to find that out, and document it.<p>Ultimately, this will build an understanding of actual time costs for actions and you'll be able to build out skeletal plans very easily and know when others are making misstatements about durations...<p>Hope that helps.<p>Watch the lynda.com ms project vids - if you're in a crunch, PM me and Ill get you them...",1304400490

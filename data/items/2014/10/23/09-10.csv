8497386,comment,8497233,8497233,0,0,csa,,,"Reposted from here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8496518"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8496518</a><p>A review of his Mandarin based on a close listen of the first 5 minutes of the video and listening to the rest in the background while I type this (let me know if it changes later):<p>tl;dr - Definitely ILR 1+, probably an ILR 2. Pronunciation needs a ton of work, but that&#x27;s not the only aspect that is measured when analyzing speech. The foreign policy article (linked in another comment) is overly critical, imho.<p>Detailed:<p>ILR LEVEL<p>He&#x27;s definitely at least an ILR 1+. He shows signs of ILR 2 characteristics (and is probably an ILR 2), but it&#x27;s hard to tell if he can sustain them in a wide range of contexts. While his pronunciation needs A LOT of work, the language itself is comprehensible to a sympathetic native listener. I strongly disagree with the Foreign Policy article that says it was &quot;terrible&quot;. I would say that it&#x27;s actually kind of amazing given that he&#x27;s the CEO of a huge company. I would roughly say that he is on par with a good / above average 3rd year student at a school with a really good Chinese program. The original article says 2nd year, but this would be a superstar 2nd year student who was either a heritage speaker or had spent a lot of time in China (e.g., as a homestay or study abroad).<p>DISCOURSE STRUCTURE AND STYLE<p>He is able to sustain the dialogue for a long time. He is able to circumlocute decently (this really opens up the ability to communicate), but I would really like to see his range of circumlocution. He is able to string together his sentences in moderately cohesive paragraphs. He does not demonstrate the ability to combine paragraphs cohesively at a high level (signs of an ILR 3), but I don&#x27;t think the tasks really required it.<p>His style of answering questions was very American -- very direct. I don&#x27;t think that a Chinese speaker who has lived exclusively in China (i.e., not educated or trained in the &quot;West&quot;) would answer the same questions similarly. In this case, I actually think that it&#x27;s best for him to answer in an American way even if he could answer in a Chinese style, but that&#x27;s a different and longer discussion.<p>Early on when he tells the story of his wife and her grandmother, he really comes across as quite charming.<p>GRAMMAR<p>He does decently enough. There are errors, but it&#x27;s not hard to understand what he is saying -- especially for a sympathetic native listener. The sample didn&#x27;t really demonstrate a wide range of grammar, but the tasks didn&#x27;t necessarily require a wide range. He is able to say complex sentences (i.e., two independent clauses), and he is able to speak in different timeframes (normally tenses, but Chinese tenses are not like English). This all points to a solid ILR 2, but grammar is definitely not the toughest part of Mandarin.<p>VOCABULARY<p>He has a decent vocabulary -- it&#x27;s solid for the task. I wonder what his vocabulary is like outside of the topics of personal bio information, Facebook, and Facebook business. If he wants to get to ILR 2+ or ILR 3, he will need to work on the accuracy and diversity of his vocabulary.<p>PRONUNCIATION<p>This is easily his weakest point. He has a HEAVY American accent. He mispronounces a lot of words. His tones are WAY off. He seems completely unable to say English loan words in Chinese (e.g., Facebook, Google, etc.). It&#x27;s actually kind of hard to listen to. That being said, I would say that it is all comprehensible to a sympathetic native listener.<p>SUMMARY<p>Overall, really good for someone who is not studying full time and has a very involved full time job. I wonder how much of it was practiced or rehearsed -- a lot of the questions are ones that he definitely _should_ practice (e.g., the story about why he started studying Chinese), since they are standard questions that would be asked to him and/or the Facebook CEO. Regardless, speaking in a foreign language to a large group of people is not easy, and he came across really well.<p>RECOMMENDATIONS<p>He can work on his pronunciation in several ways:<p>- Listen more. Even if it&#x27;s on in the background, it will help. Right now, I don&#x27;t think he has a good intuitive sense when he is mispronouncing a word.<p>- When working with a teacher, do lower level language tasks, and act like a native speaker whose voice/accent he likes. Research suggests that this lowers affective filters for pronunciation.<p>- Work with suprasegmentals with a pronunciation program that visualize what he&#x27;s saying. It can be enlightening.<p>- Practice over pronouncing words. If he does what he perceives as a &quot;caricature&quot; of pronouncing the word, he will probably be closer to accurate.<p>Other than that, listen more, read more, and I think he will become a rock-solid ILR 2 with room for growth if he wants it.<p>That&#x27;s my quick-and-dirty. I am very interested in the informed opinions of others.",1414058155

The actual Red Cross text is:<p><pre><code>   You are not eligible to donate if:\n\n      From January 1, 1980, through December 31, 1996,\n      you spent (visited or lived) a cumulative time\n      of 3 months or more, in the United Kingdom (UK),\n      ...

DeepMind did not disclose the size of the transactions, but people familiar with the matter said the deals are worth tens of millions of pounds.<p>The move was described by company executives as a broader effort by Google to invest in the UK’s scientific and academic sector, with DeepMind also establishing significant ties to the university’s computer science and engineering science departments.<p>This will see DeepMind employees lecturing at the university, students being offered internships at the company and researchers from both groups collaborating on artificial intelligence (AI) projects. Google will also make a “substantial contribution” to the university, a donation described by one person familiar with the matter as worth many millions.<p>DeepMind is led by co-founder Demis Hassabis, whose varied career has led him to be heralded as a chess prodigy, renowned video games designer, expert computer programmer and influential neuroscientist. He has previously said his vision is to create a “Manhattan project” for AI, using Google’s vast financial and computing resources to attract the world’s greatest minds on the subject.<p>“These are exciting times for artificial intelligence, and this partnership further cements the UK’s position in the vanguard of this increasingly impactful field,” said Mr Hassabis.<p>DeepMind is working on “general” AI, systems that behave like the human brain, which use “unstructured” information from their surroundings to make independent decisions and predictions. This is unlike most other AI systems, which rely on human programmers to attach “labels” to data in order for a computer to make sense of information.<p>Dark Blue Labs, led by Nando de Freitas and Phil Blunsom, is creating systems to understand “natural language” that would allow computers to comprehend the meaning of sentences and how people react to them.<p>Vision Factory, headed by Andrew Zisserman, is developing systems capable of the visual recognition of objects in the real word. This means, for example, giving robots three-dimensional awareness that can allow them to understand how a cup sits on a table.<p>All three computer science professors and the teams working under them will become DeepMind employees, but they will also retain their current roles and continue their research at Oxford.<p>The acquisition provides DeepMind with about 10 new employees, lifting its staff numbers to around 100. To obtain a job at the company, candidates usually have one or more PhDs, while also undergoing a rigorous process of seven interviews and two examinations.",1414056388

Yet I don&#x27;t see him advocating that Ubuntu force users to choose high-entropy passwords and rotate them regularly. If he&#x27;s fine letting users choose a low level of security by picking simple passwords, why not also let them choose to auth with fingerprints?<p>Also, I think he misconstrues the purpose of Touch ID. It&#x27;s not meant to completely replace passwords.<p>There are three categories of authentication methods:<p>1. Something you know (password, combination, challenge responses).<p>2. Something you have (crypto token, phone, key).<p>3. Something you are (fingerprint, face, DNA, etc).<p>Methods can be combined for added security. All three have advantages and disadvantages. Passwords are typically chosen by users, making them weak. Good crypto tokens are hard to copy, but loss or theft can mean getting locked-out. Biometrics are convenient, but can&#x27;t be revoked. Also, some activities can make them hard to read.[1]<p>Apple uses all three authentication methods in the iPhone. Touch ID is for basic access. The passcode is for admin-level functionality like erasing or restoring the device. Lastly, physical access to the phone is required to decrypt important data such as Apple Pay&#x27;s Device Access Numbers. This gives typical, non-technical users a sane combination of security and convenience. If thieves and scammers start copying fingerprints, Apple will change their auth mechanisms.<p>1.

Writing to even addresses is ignored; the value is buffered and the address discarded. Writing to odd addresses writes the entire 32bits, using whatever value was last buffered for the other half. So both the PID write and the checksum write are ignored on real FTDI chips, as they are both written to even addresses. I still don&#x27;t know why it works on clone chips though, since the checksum is written to the wrong place (it should normally be on an odd address); presumably they don&#x27;t check it.&quot;<p>Basically driver is fuzzing &#x27;chips claiming to be FTDI&#x27; with illegal instructions. Want to play clone games? better  emulate me completely, otherwise tough titties. I like it. Might not work to well for FTDI in the end due to PR nightmare, but from engineering standpoint its quite brilliant.",1414054968

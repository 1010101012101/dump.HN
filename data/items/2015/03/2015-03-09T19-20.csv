How I would approach it is by attacking the problem head on so you don&#x27;t have to bring in a business development person who is a complete unknown within your group, and just trusting them to get the job done.  Go to local meetup groups, and maybe even meetups within a 2+ hour radius.  Troll craigslist for potential clients nationwide.

I have a 2012 MacBook non-retina, with DVD writer and all the ports I need (MagSafe, Gigabit ethernet, FireWire, ThunderBolt (also Mini DisplayPort so I don&#x27;t need fiddly adapters to connect to TVs), 2 USB ports, an SD card slot, as well as headphone output, and line input (both switchable to digital optical S/PDIF), and a decent sized screen with plenty of space to rest my hands on the device. I truly believe I have the last decent model! The RAM is upgradable and the battery and hard disk replaceable (but it&#x27;s impossible to plug in two USB dongles next to each other, silly or what).<p>This new MacBook is firstly tiny (nowhere to rest my hands), a screen size that is the same as a Samsung Note (the big 12&quot; one), everything is along the edges, and THERE IS ONE PORT. Do I now need to carry along a hub in addition to all of the adapters???? It&#x27;s so stupid I am struggling to comprehend who their target audience is? They mention the USB-C and that you can plug screens, power and devices into it - but the big question is: can I do all three things at the same time?? Or would I need to eject my USB stick just to power my device? Even my monochrome 386SX Amstrad laptop from 1991 had more ports (only 4MB of RAM mind you).<p>My first monitor that I could get was a 10&quot; IBM CGA screen which was tiny - this is competing for the most ridiculous sized screen on a daily use machine. Perhaps they are converging with the Apple Watch?<p>When I saw it I thought it was a funny joke and then I realised that it was actually true and on Apple&#x27;s site; I realised that Apple in their pursuit of extreme thinness have abandoned all the reasons why people bought a laptop in the first place (a portable computer, you know, with ports that you can use). I frequently use a MacBook Air at work and it makes me angry pretty quickly - tiny screen, no ports. I have to wander around with a bunch of dongles to use it with other devices (I need ethernet for AVB audio and sometime must demonstrate on a TV). This new MacBook looks like the plasticy bendy laptops you see in the budget range of PC shops - not a good look to be going for.<p>I was saddened to see that the ordinary applications that are part of the OS are labelled &quot;apps&quot; at the bottom of the screen, and truly hope this isn&#x27;t a move towards the merging of OSX and iOS as has been feared for some time, starting with the merging of styles. I develop software for OSX as my day job on a Mac Pro (the ones you could drive over) and this saddens me.<p>This is truly the daftest thing I&#x27;ve seen, and I&#x27;m an Apple fan and OSX/iOS developer with a stash of Apple gear, a daily Mac OSX development job and sideline OSX job too. Disclaimer: I thought I&#x27;d best add that because there is a sad tendency here on HN to behave like &quot;slashdot&quot; and ridicule other people for having opinions.<p>And about Force Touch: I would prefer Force Invisibility or Force Persuasion, like in Jedi Knight please.<p>EDIT: Just noticed they&#x27;re still doing the MacBook Pro and I have engaged in much confusion, but still it&#x27;s a crazy device that won&#x27;t be able to compete with ordinary PC laptops with ports, methinks.",1425930979

Trying to figure out how the entire internet is structured and comparing that to a giant computer is slightly more exciting. Comparing data models to the human brain is slightly exciting. But miles ahead sounds like we&#x27;re making leaps when we aren&#x27;t. And you can go ahead and argue that every leap is made up of tiny steps, but when you fade in and out of technology enough, even then, some things really feel like leaps, and other things really feel like steps.

At runtime, though, C programs normally leave no indication in memory of what is a pointer and what is pure data; even if you changed the compiler to emit this and the allocator to track it, you&#x27;d have problems with fairly common constructions like custom allocators, unions where it may be nontrivial to determine which alternative is in use (especially since the data may actually be uninitialized), tagged pointers, hashes based on the pointer value, et cetera.  Garbage collectors for C run into the same problems and forbid some of those constructions, but they can always fall back on not collecting an allocation if they&#x27;re unsure whether a reference to it is a real pointer or just an integer with the same value.  If you&#x27;re actually relocating things, you can&#x27;t risk accidentally changing the value of some integer.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t expect such a scheme to be implemented, considering how complicated (and limited) it would be.  It sounds more realistic to implement a scheme that implements the full semantics even if at a severe performance cost, as suggested in the article, and expect ported Mill programs to stop using fork without exec for anything important.",1425930301

This assumption leads to some great solutions to hard problems because the programmer is essentially free to do what they want.<p>There’s an assumption here that it would be impossible to design a language which would make these solutions available without being as error prone. Existing languages may be less capable than C, but that’s only because equally capable languages with less risk haven’t been created (Rust may be a solution, I&#x27;m not sure yet).<p>What exactly do you think <i>can’t</i> be done in a language that is less error-prone?<p>> We do not need new languages. What we need is programmers who won&#x27;t abuse the languages we already have.<p>You’re part of the problem. It takes incredible hubris to say something like this, to think that it’s even possible for a human to do this.<p>Every nontrivial networking program written in C has security holes caused by memory management issues. If you’re going to claim that these errors are caused by bad programmers, then every C programmer is a bad programmer, because every C programmer has written bugs like this. If you’re claiming that bugs caused by C’s error-prone semantics are programmers abusing the language, then <i>using C is equivalent to abusing C</i>. The very best programmers writing C write bugs in C that they wouldn’t write in a language like Rust.<p>A system which depends on humans being perfect is bound to fail. There’s simply no way you can reasonably debate this fact.<p>Every other engineering field has redundancy, multiple layers of error checking that catch errors.<p>Until you see this as a problem then you’re a danger to any mission-critical product you work on. Not understanding that using C is a risk displays a shocking level of naiveté for a professional in this field. I’m not saying C is never a good choice.

9173188,comment,9172135,9172665,0,0,glesica,,,"If you&#x27;re not happy with the education then <i>do something about it</i>.<p>One great option that isn&#x27;t presented often enough is to transfer to a different institution. Don&#x27;t think that just because the school you&#x27;re at sucks for you that all of them will. In some cases you can actually get into a <i>better</i> school than you got into out of high school as a transfer student (although some schools are weird about accepting transfers, Google can help).<p>Also, note that I said &quot;for you&quot;, very few, if any, colleges or universities in the US suck in general. Some are stronger or weaker in certain areas, some emphasize certain aspects of education over others, and some will better prepare you for various jobs than others, but it is an individual evaluation.<p>Another thing to keep in mind is whether what you&#x27;re hoping to get out of school is really what colleges and universities offer. Maybe college isn&#x27;t right for you. Colleges and universities do not prepare you for a job (with a few notable exceptions like professional programs such as law and medical school, and certain business programs). Instead, they prepare you to prepare yourself for a job.<p>A lot of people like to trash the emphasis on theory in academic CS programs, but if you pay attention, and work hard (which it sounds like you are, with your side projects) the theory becomes pretty damn useful later when you get a job and you&#x27;re shown a couple hundred (or thousand if you&#x27;re really &quot;lucky&quot;) lines of spaghetti code and asked to figure out why it is &quot;slow&quot;, etc. A lot of people don&#x27;t take the time to digest the theory they learn and therefore they aren&#x27;t able to apply it to real problems when they go out into the world. Don&#x27;t make that mistake.<p>However, does everyone need those exact skills? Nope, we need tons of people who can pump out relatively simple, relatively repetitive (though not enough to automate) code for relatively standard applications. We also need people who can maintain that (and other) code, write tests, automate processes, and a hundred other things each requiring a slightly different mixture of skills, not all of which are (or should be) taught in college. Additionally, and this is important for startups, we need people who have strong social and organizational skills, who don&#x27;t necessarily spend all day writing code (not to mention the hardware people, everyone always forgets about them :)<p>So instead of plowing $30k/year into an education you aren&#x27;t sure you want, you might want to think about a different path. Do some research. If other schools are stronger in what you want to learn, maybe you should transfer. It could also be that college just isn&#x27;t what you should be doing right now, perhaps a program as described in TFA, or one of the other &quot;code schools&quot; would be more your style and better fits your interests. You can usually go back to college and pick up where you left off if you change your mind (although depending on the school your tuition might go up in that case).",1425928363

Then, when someone approaches, and relies upon institutional trustworthiness to accomplish a certain purpose, such as by invoking the CDC, the AMA, and medical colleges around the world to convince parents to vaccinate their child, what you absolutely do not want is for them frantically searching the paperwork for the checkbox that has to be unchecked in order to not give the kid autism (especially the Ask.com toolbar form of it) with their immunity.<p>It may be obvious to you that Oracle and physicians are different.

Everything they do not understand is equally magical.<p>Oracle contributes to the undermining of trust in the same way as the quick-lube mechanic that charges to refill the blinker fluid, or the home renovation contractor that does a bait-and-switch with the estimates, or the banker that issues a bunch of liar loans, or the public retirement plan administrator that invests in businesses owned by friends of the mayor, or the fed-cop who uses parallel construction on illegal surveillance data to catch a crook.<p>It creates an atmosphere of mistrust.  That alone is not sufficient to bleed over into medicine, but the health care industry in the US is an enormous, corrupt clusterfuck.  Anecdotes are not data, but a well-told story shapes public opinion in a measure far beyond statistical significance.  One video documentary on YouTube is more impactful than a 200-page CDC report.  If the CDC has no inherent trustworthiness, people will preferentially believe the thing they can understand.<p>It isn&#x27;t Oracle&#x27;s <i>fault</i>, in any measurable way, but they certainly are not helping.

To do this, we build devops tools that streamline information security compliance for web and mobile applications. We currently focus primarily in healthcare, on HIPAA compliance.<p>Our philosophy is that good engineering products and practices are the best competitive advantage for teams working in regulated technology. We build tools and provide services that help our customers gain those advantages. We serve all kinds of customers, from small dev teams to large business units of established companies.<p>We are backed by the best investors in tech, including Y Combinator (S14), Rock Health, Maverick and Lux Capital.<p>YOU ARE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You have extensive experience using modern Javascript libraries like Ember, Angular, Backbone, and React<p>- You have experience writing back-end code using Ruby on Rails<p>- You are design-minded, have excellent taste, and are detail-oriented
- You have a proven history of designing and building world-class user interfaces<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility<p>WHY WORK WITH US?<p>- <i>Engineering First:</i> Aptible is a tech company from the ground up.

This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.<p>- <i>Our Business Model:</i> We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren’t the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.<p>- <i>Our Customers:</i> We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates.

I mean, the battery on the watch will at some point fail or need replacing. I get that the watch should be serviceable, but then; if the internals can be replaced, why price it so high? What&#x27;s there to guarantee that 50 years down the line the thing will still be usable?",1425927750

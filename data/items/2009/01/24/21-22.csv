I guess what I am saying is that instead of replacing the current system, whatever comes next will just add another layer to it. Instead of having the bachelor's degree as the golden ticket to employment, everyone will start to see the master's degree as the gold standard.<p>This might finally allow for some innovation at the undergrad level, but the end result will be the same: in an effort to handle so many students suddenly interested in pursuing a MS/MA, schools will lower the quality of education and dilute the value of the graduate degree. Then it'll start again with something else.<p>To actually <i>abolish</i> the current system and take up something new would require people with current degrees admitting they aren't the sole route to success, which is like saying you know the $2k TV is just as good, but you preferred to pay $40k anyway.

448453,comment,448250,448250,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"My wife is currently going through college because she needs certification. However when we worked it out she's paying the equivalent of $80 every time she walks into a class, yet for an <i>entire</i> 2 hour class they were taught how to fold a business letter (she didn't attend, we went out the night before because she already knew how pointless the class would be), I made the nice point that the dollar store sells a letter folder. So they paid $80 for something that can easily be done for $1.<p>This isn't to mention that her books can basically be bought only through the college bookstore because they add some tiny unnecessary thing in and double the price. Her Machine Transcription book (like $50 off amazon) came with a foot pedal (we've seen ones with the same basic functions for $20) and she was forced to pay $150 because they didn't say what make the foot pedal was or what software it came with.<p>Higher Education is essentially a scam. At 16 I started working as a reviewer, my editor said that he avoided taking anyone who'd been through college and university because they didn't know how to speak their own voice. The most successful journalism today (where the money is) is a form of Gonzo (IE Hunter S. Thompson), I mean read the main articles in Wired and they're Gonzo. Yet Journalism courses don't teach that and they can't, because there's never going to be a course that can teach you to be unique.<p>I ended up reading many things from magazine and newspaper editors. I can't remember the guys name anymore but he was editor of the Times newspaper, he said whenever an application appeared on his desk, if it included taking Journalism in college or university anywhere except at the bottom of the list he'd throw it straight in the trash. So basically, if you wanted to work for Times Newspaper when he ran it you had a better chance if you was <i>anyone but</i> a journalism graduate! His reasoning was precisely that they <i>don't</i> know how to write news that sells. He said that he'd prefer someone who had good personality in their writing and build them up from there, because all the journalism graduates thought that going through university entitled them to a job and most didn't even send samples of their work in, which IMHO is patently moronic.",1232833711

You aren't going to believe him no matter what he says, because doing so is admitting that you did something very very stupid.<p>The same is true for higher education. At the undergrad level, outside of certain technical areas, the entire value of the degree is due to the <i>belief</i> that it is valuable. As long as more or less everyone continues to believe the degree itself has inherent value, it will continue to be valuable.

If we assume it is the duty of the regulators to make sure that the educational institution is doing its job properly (and how to measure ""properness"" is also the responsibility of the regulators -- after all, they have the role of gatekeepers!), then if what you said is true, it is precisely a case of a regulator's failure.<p>Aside of that, I realized how you could have validly arrived at your conclusion (lost all faith): if all you have seen is bad universities, then your generalization is probabilistically correct.

448421,comment,447435,448082,0,0,RobGR,,,"Thanks for your insights.  I agree that from the point of view of a developer writing complex applications simply, Plan 9 is on the right path.  What I read of the cleaner operating system interface is what attracted me to Plan 9 at the start.<p>I think a lot of the ""new"" things in programming are also attempts to fill that same need, of a cleaner, simpler interface to the underlying computer.  All the ""frameworks"" out there, Android even, are attempting to clear that tangle of OS interface that has grown up underneath the applications.<p>However, to have any of the nice design and brain-work come to real usefulness, Plan 9 has to actually address the grundgy parts of the problem.  The hardware support must be there -- not for all hardware out there, but you have to get the items that have huge market share and are cheap.  The user interface needs to be improved of course, and I think the community is actually pretty active and helpful for it's size -- if other issues were attacked, that would take care of itself.<p>Thinking over how Plan 9 failed, I am reminded of rms's assertion that there is a GNU operating system, and that there was so much work to do GNU ended up writing everything else except the kernel, and thus GNU is most often used with the Linux kernel from somewhere else.  Plan 9 is kind of what an operating system that just has a kernel looks like. They need to copy large parts of GNU as quickly as possible.<p>I realized what acme was, but I never even attempted any spell-checking or fancy features.  I may not have tried hard enough, but I had problems simple placing the cursor where I expected, and simple stuff like that.  I never gave it hours uninterrupted learning and experimentation, which is what I did when I decided to become as good at vi as I am with emacs; given the whole Plan 9 system seemed dead, it didn't seem worth it.<p>If I had infinite money and were dictator of the world and etc, here is what I would do to make Plan 9 happen:<p>-- Make sure that the cheapest Dell laptop had complete hardware support.  Note that this is something that Linux often fails at, and even Windows has problems in this area.<p>-- Re-license it under the GPL (maybe BSD) licenses.  If that is not allowed under the current license, it is conceivable that a small number of smart people could re-write it in a year, using the Lucent as a template, and possibly improving certain areas as they went.  Even if they tossed the hard features, once a self-hosting, working, useable system was available under the GPL, a larger community could re-address the problem areas.",1232831564

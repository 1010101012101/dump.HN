The adverts are mind-numbing. Seriously, I have to leave the room now. Every damn one has animated/puppet talking animals in, none of them sell the benefits of any sort of product they&#x27;re just attempts to manipulate. Dammit, if the point of those adverts is to make people willing to pay for media without any ads they&#x27;re sure doing it right ... thing is when are they going to start making that media. Even films that you pay £10+ to see are laden with adverts.

The arguments for accepting variants of <i>spelling</i> do not, I think, automatically apply to accepting (illogical) variants of <i>phrases</i>; while there <i>is</i> no intrinsically &#x27;right&#x27; spelling of a word, there is a sense (given what the constituent words mean) in which &quot;I could care less&quot; and &quot;I couldn&#x27;t care less&quot; are objectively different, and the latter captures what is probably meant.<p>I mean to say that it is perfectly possible to insist on, and to try to enforce, a logical approach to the use of language.

9450010,comment,9449814,9449814,0,0,joshstrange,,,"So this [0] article is where I got the numbers that have caused a fair amount of the outrage that led to this announcement from Valve.<p>The modders were getting 25% of the mod sales, Valve was getting 30% (a standard for digital distribution channels), and 45% going to Bethesda. The outrage being how much Bethesda got. Bethesda responded to this in the linked article [0]:<p>> Many have questioned the split of the revenue, and we agree this is where it gets debatable. We’re not suggesting it’s perfect, but we can tell you how it was arrived at.<p>> First Valve gets 30%. This is standard across all digital distributions services and we think Valve deserves this. No debate for us there.<p>> The remaining is split 25% to the modder and 45% to us. We ultimately decide this percentage, not Valve.<p>> Is this the right split? There are valid arguments for it being more, less, or the same. It is the current industry standard, having been successful in both paid and free games. After much consultation and research with Valve, we decided it’s the best place to start.<p>> This is not some money grabbing scheme by us. Even this weekend, when Skyrim was free for all, mod sales represented less than 1% of our Steam revenue.<p>> The percentage conversation is about assigning value in a business relationship. How do we value an open IP license? The active player base and built in audience? The extra years making the game open and developing tools? The original game that gets modded? Even now, at 25% and early sales data, we’re looking at some modders making more money than the studio members whose content is being edited.<p>> We also look outside at how open IP licenses work, with things like Amazon’s Kindle Worlds, where you can publish fan fiction and get about 15-25%, but that’s only an IP license, no content or tools.<p>> The 25% cut has been operating on Steam successfully for years, and it’s currently our best data point. More games are coming to Paid Mods on Steam soon, and many will be at 25%, and many won’t. We’ll figure out over time what feels right for us and our community. If it needs to change, we’ll change it.<p>If you ask me 45% is too high, I don&#x27;t think it should be exactly 0% but to give the developers so little seems criminal...<p>Another source for this was fact that there is no real support for mods especially with mods interacting with other mods. While there was a return period (24hrs IIRC) a number of gamers were arguing that you don&#x27;t always find out within 24hrs if a mod will conflict with another mod. Maybe a long trial period would have helped to alleviate some of this.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.bethblog.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bethblog.com/</a>",1430182128

My friend managed to download 50,000 passwords from GreatestJournal.com because they left their MySQL server exposed to the Internet, with no password, and the open-source LiveJournal code stored passwords in plain text in the DB.  He reported the vulnerability to them, and their response was to put a password on the MySQL server (and take it off the Internet a few days later), write a blog post saying &quot;You may want to change your passwords if you reuse your GJ.com password on other sites&quot;, and then take down that blog post a couple days later.<p>By contrast, when I worked at Google, a security bug was a drop-everything P0 bug.

Contradiction helps with this since it naturally encompasses proving by contrapositive also. Because if you&#x27;re trying to prove that p->q, you can assume p and ~q and getting to ~p is a contradiction since p^~p (and this is the same structure as a proof by contrapositive if you got to this line without assuming p). And of course if you find any other absurdities along the way sooner, you&#x27;re done quicker.<p>This is nice because a proof by contrapositive is more or less equivalent to a direct proof. So simply by always starting with proof by contradiction, you cover the cases where the theorem:<p>- is simple enough for you to find out exactly why it&#x27;s true (direct proof hidden in the contrapositive).<p>- is complex and wide reaching enough for you to hit an absurdity quickly",1430182002

There is a default assumption in our self-help culture that a majority of our characteristics are open to change if we just apply ourselves, have good character, grit, etc.  Alas, that does not appear to be the case.  Some things are almost trivial to change, such as phobias.  A trained practitioner can typically eliminate phobias in hours.  On the other hand, at least from a 1994 perspective, some aspects of sexual orientation never change.  Seligman presented a layered model of our sexual orientation, and at the very lowest, hardest to change layer is &quot;what gender do I feel like&quot;.  I can see there being a huge range of variation on internal feeling, depending on which genes are expressed, and how much, how certain hormones are enabled in the growing fetus, etc.  We only have to consider hermaphrodites and the huge array of ways that physical sexual development can go awry and extend that to the invisible variations.  I remember reading that book when it came out and thinking that must be about the scariest feeling one can have, to be in an X body but every part of me feels like a Y.<p>[0]  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/What-You-Change-Cant-Self-Improvement/dp/1400078407"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/What-You-Change-Cant-Self-Improvement/...</a>",1430181597

I also pirate game of thrones, which for a long time could only be viewed legally with an HBO subscription.  I think it is silly to have to subscribe to something and pay a yearly fee just to watch 10 episodes of a single show once a year.

Someone else may already have the distribution rights in other countries. As I have explained before, films are often financed by using pre-sales agreements with foreign distributors as collateral for a production loan.<p>For example, If I am developing a film I might go a film market and say &#x27;hey, I am making a film about X with a budget of Y, and I have an agreement from film star Z to participate.&#x27; Suppose film star Z is very popular in South East Asia; so distributors from China, Japan, South Korea, and a few other countries all say &#x27;oh, film star Z! We would pay $10 million each to have the rights to that movie.&#x27; So then I&#x27;d get them to sign an agreement to that effect and open up bank accounts in those countries. Then I would take those letters to a US bank and say &#x27;look I have $30 million in presales commitments, so give me money.&#x27; In other words the foreign distributors are entering into a binding contract to purchase the film at a certain price by a certain date if it meets certain agreed-upon requirements about delivery format, quality, and content. Those contracts are good enough to borrow money against, and that (in a nutshell) is how many films get made.<p>Amazon is usually buying a limited set of rights because they buy already-copleted films for the most part. They&#x27;re not in the film-financing business in a big way so far, so they&#x27;re not in a position to bid on worldwide rights in the first place.<p><i>As mentioned, if you give me access to high-quality (encoded) content without DRM, I&#x27;m willing to pay for it. If not, you&#x27;re simply charging for an inferior product.</i><p>Oh, DRM. What about all the people that will take advantage of the absence of DRM to just copy it about freely and untraceably? Fine, so you&#x27;re not one of them, that&#x27;s nice, but it doesn&#x27;t solve my problem as a film producer. I&#x27;m not sure the value of (sales lost to anti-DRM purists) exceeds the value of (sales lost to rampant casual copying).",1430180327

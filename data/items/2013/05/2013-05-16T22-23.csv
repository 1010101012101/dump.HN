I had a half baked card game (where seeing other peoples faces was a critical element) that I was planning to implement on G+.<p>Aside from embedding the game in the G+ Web UI, what are you missing that you would have had with G+ Games with existing G+ APIs (Hangouts, Moments) and the Google Play Game Services API?<p>AFAICT, shutting down G+ Games just means that the Google+ UI as a portal to web games is going away.",1368745188

The intuition to stick to it even if there are hard times does actually have a sensible foundation: If the business took off in a couple of months without you being part of it, you would probably regret having left it.<p>So what you really want to evaluate is the likelihood of the business taking off within a timeframe that's tolerable for you. Startups have the property that not all progress is immediately rewarded. Some companies have to go through tough times until they hit gold. You now have to decide whether you think you have such a company or not.<p>As you obviously have more knowledge about your own situation/company than I do I can't assist you directly in that decision.\nHowever, I remember reading a rule of thumb that if a startup does not have any significant traction (users or customers) 1.5 to 2 years after its foundation it is likely that there is something wrong with the business or product. I think this may have some truth in it.",1368745115

The USA, Australia, UK (and much of Europe) still have major problems with racism.<p>My wife and her family (Filipino) weren't allowed to stay in the ""white"" motel 20 years ago somewhere in Alabama or thereabouts. They ended up at the ""black"" motel (which was actually nicer, and had more expensive cars outside). So much for their fucked-up redneck notions of white supremacy.

I have a lot of opinions (that sometimes change) which may be unpopular with certain people; I don't care about those people. Most people don't care about me, nor do they read about my opinions anyway, and my blog is primarily for my future self rather than a real audience. I'm nobody, much like almost everyone else. Furthermore, there are lots of people with really crazy or eccentric or radical or just plain stupid opinions that nevertheless maintain an audience or at least live happy lives. Maybe not in Egypt, of course.<p>In terms of employment prospects, many employers won't care what you do in your free time so long as you show up and do your work. Or if you're starting your own company, many customers won't care if the CEO holds some opinion or another. Even the large public outcries against people like the CEO of Papa John's haven't killed them as a business.<p>I don't find anonymity to factor into my rudeness, unlike others. My rudeness is generally matched with the rudeness of the person I'm talking to over anything else, like my mood, feelings for the other person, or anonymity. It sometimes becomes a game, too, to see if I can be cleverly rude in response to a brutishly rude comment.",1368744877

I do the same on pretty much every web forum I post on.<p>This is partly for historical reasons: in almost all cases, I had a pseudonymous account first. However, it’s also partly for flexibility. For example, if I’m giving a personal recommendation or criticism, then I always prefer to put my name to it. On the other hand, I am very conscious of privacy concerns and very careful not to give away anything I shouldn’t about other people or businesses. Posting with a pseudonym means I can still contribute controversial viewpoints or relevant information to some discussions that I wouldn’t be comfortable leaving on the public record.<p>For the record, I make no secret of having multiple accounts for any affected site admins, who in general could trivially identify any pseudonyms I use with a quick search of private e-mail addresses if they wanted to. Also, my pseudonymous accounts tend to have feedback via votes/moderations as favourable as my “real” accounts or even a little more so, and I never abuse multiple accounts by voting in ways I otherwise couldn’t. I’d stop if anyone running a forum asked me to, but that would be disappointing as I’m careful not to abuse the privilege and I think I can make more interesting/valuable contributions as things are.",1368744188

Stark has a dark legacy, both in his family and personally.  He suffers from depression, anxiety, obsessive behavior, grandiose and offensive behavior.  The interesting part comes from the struggle between the dark and the light.<p>Only by embracing the light and dark sides of ourselves, can we truly grow past the dark parts and do good out there.

For the lunges and step-ups, I think alternating sides is good. For the side planks, I think it would be useful to give the other side a whole segment. Splitting it in half wouldn't be much of a workout.<p>2) This is awesome because for the most part, you can modulate the workout however you want. In fact, keeping a log of the number of pushups/situps/high knees/etc would be cool because people could see progress. This might be a nice extension for the site!<p>3) It may be good to balance things out as far as muscle groups go. Pushups are repeated multiple times, as are squat related exercises. It is important to balance these out with the muscles that oppose these exercises.<p>4) Even better (at least for me) would be to have a series for desk workers that open up your body.

My partners were idiots, they didn't want to do anything I suggest. I told them about TechStars Boulder at the start some 2.5 years ago now (I live in Denver), they didn't like the sound of it, didn't like having to give away equity for 'nothing in return'.  Now, 2+ years later, the one remaining Biz partner wanted to do TechStars, is leaving his day job to put everything into this. I told him I simply couldn't take the time off to do it now, that time had past, I have a new fulltime job I love and there is no way I'd jeopardize it for our startup now (turns out he applied and we were turned down anyway, probably for the best).<p>Unfortunately sometimes you just have the wrong partner(s), it's as simply as that.  Why not get a full-time job and go into maintenance mode ont the startup?  That's basically what I finally did. I told my remaining partner I can't live like this anymore, barely scraping by and that I was going to get  a fulltime job and commit to them 100%.  I will still fix bugs but as far as new features go, I simply tell him I won't add anything until he signs up 10 new accounts and pays me for my time now.  Hasn't happened yet and he's been trying for about 6 months now focused on the business trying to sell accounts.<p>Be honest with them and tell them you can't live like this any more, you've kept your end of the deal, they are welcome to soldier on but you have your own responsibilities to take care of. You'll gladly help maintain what has been built, fix bugs and do what you can outside your normal 9-5 job, but otherwise you are going to have to focus on what's best for you and your family.

If you cling to it, then you will never leave, even if your co-founders are idiots and the business is a failure. What you need to do is quit as soon as possible. Only then can you start on a better endeavor and improve your quality of life.<p>I once heard someone say, ""Give up on crap."" It may sound juvenile, and it goes against the rosy, feel-good ""Never give up"" pep talks that we're used to and almost expect to hear. But I've found it to be a much better guide in life decisions. Go with it.",1368741683

As someone actively involved in the art world (photography, music, dance, and theater) as well as the tech world, this article made sense to me. A lot of it, though, gets down to the art world simply not understanding their (potential) customers. The art cognoscenti have traditionally sold a sense of elitism and insiderism that is, frankly, alien to most programmers. If they want rich programmers to support the world of fine art, they need to find a way to make it valuable in non-financial terms. Programmers simply don't value ""taste"" the same way (see PG's excellent essay on taste here for a different take).",1368741648

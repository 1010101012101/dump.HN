Lets just assume you have a product/service/technology that has a viable market potential. My first step is to define the size of the opportunity and my best path to an ""exit"". These two components will determine if you begin @ Angel funding, VC funding or personal credit card funding (or Y combinator:))
If you have a big enough opportunity and the connection to go straight to VC, congrats. So now lets assume you don't, and you are seeking Angel money. Here's ONE model......<p>Get your company as far along as possible without funding, take it to alpha, beta or public launch if you can.<p>Build your advisory board and be very good at tracking your key data points that drive your valuation and prove your business plan.<p>Identify potential funding resources through every means possible. Every major city has an Angel Group it seems now. Reach out and learn what the group has shown interest in and what company's they've invested in. If you think there is a good mix, use every resource the group offers but avoid the pay to share your company models (in my experience that is).<p>Get your pitch down to under 10 minutes, and be unbelievably good at it. Angels tend to like ultra passionate, company consumed entrepreneurs, because thats a consistent trait in successful ones.<p>Pitch, tweak, learn. Repeat process.<p>If you want to see a good video of Tim Draper discussing how to get funded, try this link - <a href=""http://www.vator.tv/news/show/tim-draper-sings-fundraising-secrets"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vator.tv/news/show/tim-draper-sings-fundraising-s...</a>",1210319909

Besides having a really tight focus on product niche - how is this different from Ebay in terms of credentials?<p>The only site selling stuff that I know of, and actually tackles / comes closest to solving the credentials issue is Facebook. The only problem with them is that I don't see that many listings compared to craigslist and ebay",1210319441
185311,comment,185187,185187,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"The real problem with a 120-135 degree posture isn't the tendency to slide off, it's the tendency to slack off... and the difficulty of getting things accomplished from that posture.<p>I don't think the study has factored in the use of a keyboard. It's not as easy to type when you're reclined backwards - it adds extra stress to the wrists and triceps (assuming your still typing on the desk).",1210318928
185310,comment,184619,185030,0,0,chaostheory,,,"costs may not be the biggest problem, but what about the freedom to make changes to the source (to fix a bad exploit, add a feature, ...)? I still remember the telecom, I used to worked for, being burned by them; we had to pay x thousand dollars for a pre-release patch/bug fix for their black box software...<p>Speed and quality of evolution/innovation is another factor. MS generally doesn't like open source (their sourceforge clone is a start, but really doesn't go far enough.), and it took forever for MS to catch up to open source with LINQ (and polish it). The same goes for their unit testing and ANT-like deployment tool. (Yes, NHibernate and NANT have been there; but MS pretty much snubbed them instead of embracing them.)<p>At the end of the day the MS copy machine is fast, but not as fast (or good) as the open source movement.",1210318484

This means that the work must be specially ordered or commissioned by the publisher, the work must fall into one of the nine enumerated categories of work, and there must be a signed writing between the parties where they agree that the work will be considered a ""work made for hire.""",1210318276

185301,comment,185288,185288,0,0,JacobAldridge,,,"I have to agree with the point Matt makes, that advertising will continue to work better on Google than on Facebook. We mustn't forget, however, that advertising is a construct of the last two centuries and especially the period 1950-1990, and may already have passed its prime as a way of generating customers.<p>Moving forward, the value of communities may overtake the value of marketing and of brand - and think here of baby boomer 'retirement' villages as much as MySpace or Facebook.  Advertising will continue to work better on Google; but advertising as a means to generate business may be superceded.<p>For more information, albeit from a functional business perspective rather than directly on topic, see perhaps <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_</a>(business) <a href=""http://www.shirlawsonline.com/downloads/sme-report-summary.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shirlawsonline.com/downloads/sme-report-summary.z...</a>

Is this an assumption or something that has been proven?<p>Subject line most definitely has a lot to getting any email read, regardless of whether it's an invitation to use a service or attend a webinar or an event.<p>When it comes to users inviting users, LinkedIn keeps the standard template message very short. First time you get this invite, you're not sure if it was a template or hand written by whoever is inviting you.<p>The relationship with the inviter is also critical. My guess is responding to emails from people you have had a business relationship might seem more urgent/important than responding to a personal email.<p>Just some thoughts.",1210316933

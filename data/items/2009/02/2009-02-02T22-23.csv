While I believe that, I also believe that many folks who start businesses do so out of the romantic idea of owning your own business.  They may not love the business but they love the idea of owning the business.  I think this generally happens with people who are nearing retirement and are looking for something to do when they are done with their 9-5.<p>It's almost ALWAYS a bad idea.  One of the common reasons for their efforts is that they want to leave something behind...either in their name or a business that can be passed on to their children.  Why burden YOURSELF with the hassles of a business in your retirement years let alone make your children feel like they have to take over when you can no longer work?<p>If there's one thing I'd like my parents to do in their retirement, it's nothing.

Much of it is small-scale theft - for example, of the 335 attacks reported in 2001, only 73 involved guns. 16 ships were hijacked, and 21 people killed (all but one in asian waters) [ICC2001]. Being above the waves and strong enough to withstand them, in addition to a small number of firearms, will make a seastead a rather difficult target for this kind of criminal. Also, since seasteads are residential vessels, they have a much higher population density than a pirate's usual target. If the seastead uses a tugboat, the tug will be much more vulnerable, and should be watched.<p>Some piracy is done by large organized groups who capture entire ships and their goods (often tens of millions of dollars worth) to be fenced. They use forged documents to obtain a new load of cargo from legitimate shippers, and then steal it too. A seastead should not be valuable enough for this type of theft, as it is not a cargo ship, and would be rather conspicuous in port. Why attack a platform of people who would be defending their homes when you could attack a cargo boat with lightly armed sailors who would much rather not die to protect some corporation's cargo?<p>The armed and organized groups which seasteads should be the most worried about are the navies of traditional governments. Seastead defense is discussed in the infrastructure section.</i><p>Besides that, pirates these day tend to operate near the horn of Africa.",1233615217

Both CSS and TDD have huge, <i>huge</i> benefits that you shouldn't write off before you actually take the time to learn them.  The problem is the zealots talk about them as panaceas and ignore the fact that there is no one methodology that separates the pros from the amateurs.  Instead they use their expertise in one tiny niche to prove to themselves how their work is so much better than the majority of similar work due to a few arbitrary criteria.  Then they form small self-congratulatory communities to pat themselves on the back about how brilliant they are and how much everyone else could learn from them.<p>These are the people who you find trolling your blog.  Usually they aren't even particular skilled at what they do, which is why they cling to dogma and feel the need to attack other people.<p>But let me be clear.  I haven't layed out a website using tables since 2001 (and I used tables for 5 years before that), once you develop your mental model of CSS (and browser deficiencies) there are actually only a few edge cases where tables are easier.  CSS can actually solve 90% of web design challenges more elegantly than tables.  CSS makes it easier for designers to and developers to work together (I am both). There are many techniques which are only available in CSS.  All future technical developments in web design will be in the realm of CSS.<p>So it really is worth the time to slug it out with CSS and figure out what's what.  That said, web design coding (ie. HTML/CSS) is just one tiny piece of a huge potential set of web development skills.  Why does google put CSS inline?

Compare for example Japan</i><p>Japan is of course more prosperous than China, and long has been. But Japan also has pervasive use of syllabic writing (the katakana and hiragana syllabaries that are each capable of exhaustively writing anything a speaker of Japanese can speak, with very few written characters).<p>Prosperity may actually have more to do with effectiveness in spreading a standard national spoken language. The paradigmatic example here is Taiwan. When the Nationalist (KMT) regime from China fled to Taiwan (formerly occupied by Japan) after World War II, hardly anyone on Taiwan could speak Mandarin. Mandarin is about as cognate with Taiwanese (or Hakka, the other main language of Taiwan) as English is with German, or arguably even less cognate. But today anyone my age (fifty) or younger in Taiwan is conversant in Mandarin, even though the great majority of families living in Taiwan have older relatives who didn't speak that language at all. Prosperity brings telephone conversations and radio and TV broadcasting and travel and other human activities that converge language usage to a common standard. By contrast, the population of (mainland) China has long included a sizeable number of people whose native language is within the dialect category of 北方官話 (Mandarin) but that initial seed value hasn't resulted in a very impressive increase in the percentage of Mandarin speakers in China during the post-war years. That's a sign of the stark difference in prosperity between Taiwan and China.",1233613568

1. There are too many emails to start with.
2. We try hard to keep up; fail.
3. The emailers who don't get consistent replies eventually get the message or look elsewhere for answers/action and stop emailing as often or at all.
4. The volume of emails reduces towards the level at which we can keep up.
5. If/when it overshoots, and we start to really get on top of our emails, we have more energy and time and start writing more intelligent replies, or indeed initiating more email threads, thus generating more replies back to us.
6. So we converge on a certain email equilibrium, with lack of replies correcting for when we've got too many emails, and the instigation of replies from others correcting on the low side when we've got too few.<p>So why doesn't email equilibrium last? Because, alas, we get burnt out running at optimum speed.

GTD gets this right.<p>If you don't make those decisions as e-mail enters your box, you're effectively saying (while playing tetris) ""I'm going to ignore all of the L-shaped blocks and deal with the wreckage they leave behind later."" Yeah, you'll lose. You have to make a decision on _every_ piece that drops into your inbox.<p>Filters can do wonders, if you really do have a huge influx of mail. You don't have to read and respond to every message unless you really want to.",1233612191

A forwarded email is just as suspect as a screenshot that can be photoshopped.<p>I think the way that they prevent it is that you'll get fired if you do it.  People who work in the White House are usually people who a) want the sitting president to do well and b) want a career path that will get them to even better things than they're at now.  A big Obama supporter isn't going to forward an email that might be embarrassing unless it's something like an order for human children to be served at a banquet.  Likewise, if you want to someday become a congressperson or become a big(er) deal in DC, you don't want to get a reputation as ""that guy that spews everything you don't want public"".<p>So, really, you only need slight precautions to make sure that email isn't forwarded.  The kind of precautions that would let a hacker easily bypass it, but you wouldn't accidentally forward something.",1233612039

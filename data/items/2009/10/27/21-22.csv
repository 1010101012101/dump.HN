906570,comment,906502,906543,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Right, but that life experience usually takes the form of greater depth and not greater breadth.<p>One of the things that most surprised me about growing up is that I don't know <i>more</i>, I know <i>better</i>.  When I was a kid, how smart you were was determined by how many facts you could remember, and how broad that knowledge was.  Now, how smart I am is largely determined by how effectively I can judge whether a piece of knowledge is relevant to my particular situation.  I've found that very few of the things I believed in childhood were <i>wrong</i>, but a great many of them were <i>incomplete</i>.  They had little corner cases to watch out for, and situations that they didn't apply to.<p>An interesting corollary of this is that it explains why adults always seemed so dumb to me.  It's not that hard to find a random fact that most of the adults around you don't know.  (It was a little depressing how often this happened in the subjects that they were teaching me, but that's another issue.)  But that doesn't mean they're dumb: it means that you've stumbled into an area that just isn't that useful for them.  They know a lot about their specialties, but the chance that you'd happen to be seriously interested in their specialties was pretty low.<p>So yeah, philosophical debate is more interesting among experienced people - <i>if</i> you're debating things they have experience about.  I think that's why most of your submissions don't get much attention; they just seem rather useless to the things that most of us here want to accomplish.",1256680551

Of those firms that survive, they could be viewed as a collective of successful freelancers. There typically is not enough revenue to grow the company beyond the founding consultants because the project budgets that they deal with are typically $15K to $50K. You can definitely get away with not responding to RFPs if you're only ever dealing with budgets of tens of thousands of dollars. Also, an RFP is a way for customers to weed out the ""I just quit my day job at an agency and started my own consulting company"" firms. These customers want to deal with bigger firms because they expect these companies to be around for a while and provide support years down the road. A bigger company can afford to devote a few employees for a couple of weeks to address an RFP properly.",1256680297

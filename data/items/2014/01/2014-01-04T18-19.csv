I tell them that the rules are like using glue or nails to make furniture.<p>It&#x27;s possible to defy the rules and produce something awesome. But often you just need to produce something that&#x27;s reliable, sturdy, useful and quick. Learn the rules first. Use them most of the time. Break them when you&#x27;ve got a rare, wonderful reason to do so.<p>Blogging is the most conversational form of writing out there. The best bloggers conjure up structures that are so subtle and sophisticated that everything seems totally free-form. Getting that right consistently is a gift. Switching into conversation mode 100% of the time and hoping for great results is like pressing together some notched pieces of wood and hoping for the best.",1388861997

If people use Comcast, they&#x27;ll see as many ads from Google as if they were using Fiber. Google can estimate how much ADDITIONAL ad revenue they could expect per user from Fiber vs. Comcast usage and that&#x27;s probably not much.<p>At $70 or $120/month, this can be very profitable business (long-term, of course, initial investment is huge). Outside of US, companies make good profit at lower prices.<p>Same goes for self-driving cars: transportation is a massive industry. Taxis alone are $10 billion industry. Personal car ownership and use is massive. If Google could get a piece of that business, it could be more profitable than their ad business.",1388861892

7012366,comment,7011472,7011968,7,0,erikpukinskis,,,"> Thought experiment: what could that disruptive niche be?<p>Someone needs to write/buy a search engine and then build a really rich API into the internals of it that lets 3rd parties write customized search engines. How about an auto parts search engine, or a search engine for spanish-speaking people living in southern california? What about a Christian search engine, or a meme search engine?<p>When someone can empower 3rd party developers to make the same kinds of decisions as Google does, but with different tradeoffs, and they really put the full institution behind supporting that, I think:<p>A) Google will have a hard time competing because they won&#x27;t be able to give the personal attention to the needs of what is, effectively, a community of modmakers.<p>B) This new company will capture the long tail of search. Only a sliver of that is covered right now, with a scattering of niche search engines (Google Scholar, etc).<p>C) The number of users could be VERY large. It could be the cable to Google&#x27;s broadcast television.<p>D) Getting started wouldn&#x27;t require any massive technological achievements. Just find an underserved niche where even a really <i>really</i> stupid search engine would work better than Google. Write it, figure out how to make money off it it, grow. Start with something that requires only a small index. Slowly expand into additional niches according to what will help keep the company and the tech moving forward.<p>Google&#x27;s bet is that any information you can glean from someone coming to a niche search engine can be reasonably approximated with contextual information in the query. That&#x27;s proved true for many queries, but the key is to find the queries where it&#x27;s really not.",1388861784

What do you mean by that? Are SuperUsers aware of what constitutes a non-acceptable points? Are edge-cases justified and explained? Most places I see exist but their structure is ambivalent: train stations that have two terminals, several restaurants, a corresponding metro station… Should each platform have its point?<p>The gym I go to recently opened; they have a large swimming section, with two pools (actually five, but the extra three are smaller), changing rooms each with a sauna, etc.: Where can I find a clear explanation of how to describe the place, add venues? Consistent purpose? So, one unit for the whole? ‘Any place big enough so that if you are looking for a friend, you&#x27;ll be able to notice him there?’ In that case, the bar is separated by a glass wall from the lower pool, so those should be together, far from the lower-deck weightroom. Same for the nearby re-opened hotel who added a spa, a restaurant, a nightclub, a bar… What I see when checking in are seemingly inconsistent structures, and no explanation how to edit them properly.<p>Far more than the fairly straightforward ‘good behaviour’ possible rules (which have little actual impact), clarifying the goal of the tool would help other understand how to implement ‘gamification’.

7012279,comment,7011228,7012069,6,0,vidarh,,,"Yes, it has more to do with being able to <i>usually</i> get away with methods that really belong in the trash.<p>My &quot;first love&quot; in OS&#x27;s is AmigaOS, and while the OS is very dated in many ways (no memory protection, no SMP support), one of the things it really got right was to encourage extremely extensive multithreading. On Amiga&#x27;s it was a necessity if you wanted to have full multitasking, as the machines were slow enough and memory constrained enough that not doing it would severely limit usability (frankly, it would have done PC&#x27;s a world of good too, but the PC world took the simpler approach of not even trying for proper multi-tasking).<p>My favourite example is how cut and paste from the console worked.<p>It includes the device handlers handling keyboard and mouse input, the intuition input handler, which processes the raw input events and turns them into input events for specific windows, the console.device device handler which takes intuition events for console windows and &quot;cooks&quot; the events into higher level events that gets passed to the console-handler, which then will find the area you are selecting, and call a function that passes the buffer to the clipboard.device, which will then create a clipboard entry that gets written to a disk volume, which involves the filesystem handler for that filesystem, which again likely will involve a device suck as ram.device or trackdisk.device to write it to the actual device.<p>Every single one of these steps is handled by a separate thread/process (the distinction doesn&#x27;t mean much on AmigaOS due to the lack of memory protection, and are usually referred to as &quot;task&quot; instead).<p>The reason for this is all down to responsiveness: The input devices and things like trackdisk.device musc deal with hardware, and so must have priority. But if the rest of the flow was given high priority, the system would be sluggish, so the minimum amount of work is done, put into a message, tacked onto a queue, and things are off to a start.<p>At the opposite end, things like clipboard.device must not lock up when clipboard entries are added, as while the clipboards are <i>usually</i> in RAM:, they are files on a filesystem, and a user with only 512KB RAM and possibly no harddrive might in fact be using a floppy drive for the clipboard - forcing the user to wait for a floppy write would have been intolerable (and why Amiga users loved to mock Windows 3.x users back in the day).<p>This permeated through many applications as well. It was a matter of pride for many developers, and the first chapters in many Amiga developer books tended to involve Exec (Amiga&#x27;s &quot;kernel&quot;, or parts of it) which provided a set of library functions for managing messages, lists of messages and message ports, as they were essential for talking to the OS, but also readily available for application developers. For many, before you&#x27;d written your first &quot;hello world&quot; app you had gotten a crash course in making things asynchronous by default.<p>Today a day go by for me without either my browser freezing, or Thunderbird freezing or some other application, both on Linux at home and OS X at work. And on the few occasions I&#x27;ve had to work on Windows machines, there too. Every time it happens, I dream wistfully about a world where people understood how to write software that way.<p>It is, in fact, not all that hard: &quot;All it takes&quot; is to subdivide your application into smaller components that only communicate using async message queues. Incidentally it makes the apps easier to test too, and easier to make robust (unlike under AmigaOS, on a modern OS you can separate components on process boundaries where it makes sense too, and automatically restart failed components), and it makes it easy to make them scriptable etc.",1388860825

RapGenius bought backlinks to artificially inflate their pagerank.  They knew they were cheating but they did it anyway.  They got caught.  And they were hit with a manual action on Google.  Sounds good so far.  But that&#x27;s where it stops.  RapGenius, using the connections they have from their multi-million dollars in VC funding, got back on Google and was able to avoid paying the price for their cheating.<p>Compare this to regular websites.  Lots of smaller sites will end up paying a &quot;whitehat SEO&quot; firm to work on a &quot;link strategy&quot;.  These firms will claim up down and sideways that what they do is legal, ethical and follows Google&#x27;s rules.  But, what they actually do is either (1) create networks of fake sites to provide backlinks on certain terms to artificially boost the site, (2) place spam comments using bots on legitimate sites to do the same [not that this will thankfully no longer work well due to the latest Google algorithm update], or (3) pay legit sites to place backlinks to artificially transfer pagerank the same way that RapGenius did.  Now, these other sites, when they get caught, they get a manual action or a smackdown.  The difference?  They have to actually pay the penalty.  Arguing that they didn&#x27;t know usually doesn&#x27;t work.  The penalty is LONG.  They can&#x27;t call on their VC firm to make calls at Google to give them a get out of jail free card.<p>I&#x27;d like to call on Google to create a public policy on how they handle these manual actions with some clearly defined penalties (example: 3 month manual action of 6 PR drop, etc) and to consistently enforce them across the board.  That way a mom and pop site that pays a &#x27;whitehat SEO firm&#x27; and gets caught doesn&#x27;t have a worse time than a site like RapGenius that purposely engages in blackhat SEO who can use their VC connections to get out of having to pay a penalty in under 2 weeks.  It&#x27;s also sad that Google gave this get out of jail free card to a site whose entire business model is based around other people&#x27;s copyrighted works which RapGenius doesn&#x27;t have a license for, doesn&#x27;t pay for, and publishes illegally.",1388860483

I, just as you, was usually pretty annoyed with these formulaic approaches to text, until I&#x27;ve had to re-learn all this essay writing stuff for my masters. In my college, professors and students are pretty close and debate is (really) stimulated, so I decided to throw my ramblings onto the writing professor (a very good writer, indeed). I used José Saramago (a portuguese Nobel prize winner that uses commas as periods, writes giant paragraphs, all the weird stuff) as my &quot;strong&quot; example, thinking it would shed the formalized structure argument to pieces and I would rise triumphantly from the talk with a Portuguese PhD specialized in text analysis. It didn&#x27;t take me so long to realize why she had her PhD, and that her point of view was pretty convincing and, of course, well structured.<p>Kaboom! And I was illuminated. She agreed with each of my complaints. But then she proceeded to show me some texts from the beginning of the semester, comparing them with texts from the end of the semester. They were, in general, much clearer, concise, straight to the point - in one word, better. She argued that a course like that was intended to make people that do not write start to write something intelligible, comprehensible. It was not a course on creative writing. Therefore, the need for simplified rules and structures.<p>I do understand that this was the OP&#x27;s whole point: upon reading his colleague&#x27;s text, he judged it based on the rules he had learned. Then, when he talked to the other teacher, he realized that the main point of a text is to communicate something, irrespective of the number of paragraphs it has or the position of the goddamn thesis.<p>This rambling of mine is just to point to the other side: rules are important in some specific moments of the development of a proto-writer :)<p>That happens with all kinds of expressive, communicative actions we humans perform (in my opinion): photography, painting, music, poetry...

Avoid: attempting to promote each new, small \n  piece of content you create; go for big, interesting \n  items. Avoid: involving your site in schemes where your \n  content is artificially promoted to the top of these \n  services. Avoid: spamming link requests out to all sites\n  related to your topic area.

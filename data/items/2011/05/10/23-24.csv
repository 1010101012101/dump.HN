I've followed all the rules the last couple years and really haven't been rejected when I've tried to get through. About 1-2 weeks each time for each app and update. Two years ago when the app store was new, I did test the rules and got rejected in static analysis pass but that was under my own personal user and for obvious stuff.<p>I really don't know what it takes to get rejected on top of the already existing ground rules they spell out on their site. Apple really hasn't given me any trouble at all (except emailing after accepting to change a little artwork to clean up an icon next pass).",1305071906

2534553,comment,2534306,2534543,1,0,hackermom,,,"It's entirely correct. ƒ relates to DoF only in that it's relative to the maximum aperture of a specific lens. Without knowing the specifics of the lens, you cannot know from arbitrary ƒ value if the aperture has been contracted (narrowing the flow of light, thus increasing the DoF), if it's just really dark glass in the lens, if someone has a TC mounted that steals 1-2 exposure stops, or if someone has simply used a gray filter or two attached to the end of the lens. I can produce two identical exposures, both of ƒ/8.0, where one has a narrow DoF and the other 4 aperture steps deeper DoF, by simply using a gray filter in one shot, and contracting the aperture in the other. In a third example I can use a very, very dark lens such as f.e. what Leica used to produce in the 60s, still exposing at ƒ/8.0 in wide-open aperture, reaching the same exposure and achieving a narrow DoF (contrary to what anyone would think just knowing it's ƒ/8.0), but without having stopped down a single step and without having used gray filters.",1305071718

Well, perhaps in reality they will just try harder to hide the dirty laundry, but that's for another discussion. Going with the original idea, if coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan feel that what they do day to day could end up on Wikileaks.org,   perhaps they'll think twice about tolerating or engaging in abuse. Anyway, I think that's the logic.<p>Now you can of course ask ""What did Obama do to deserve the Nobel Peace Prize?"". My answer would be ""nothing"" but many here will probably disagree with that. So to me it all just seems rather random who gets peace prizes and why: Is it a statement of encouragement, like a ""preemptive"" peace prize, in hopes more peace to come in the future? Or is it for specific past accomplishments, and then how does one measure that? What were Obama's accomplishments when he got his?",1305071453

But I think in reality we don't need to reject our parents methods or the game itself - we just need to adjust our way of thinking.<p>If I use the analogy of building accommodation - if you lived in New York, you would learn how to build a high rise apartment block, if you lived in Montana, you might learn how to build a single story farm house. If your New York builder parents moved to Montana, your high rise building skills would not be as successful in Montana - it doesn't mean that your parents are at fault, or that the fundamentals of building theory are incorrect or bad. Nor is the 'game' (in this case, how to build accommodation) in itself at fault.<p>Most people will not experience the move from 'NYC' to 'Montana' and won't understand the challenges that it entails.

At least I heard more news about his Swedish affair than about anything significant disclosed by wikileaks (nicknames of the politicians aside).<p>Read the newspaper much?  WikiLeaks and Assange have been responsible for breaking more MAJOR stories than all of the media outlets combined.  First we had the Collateral Murder video which showed a Baghdad airstrike where Iraqi civilians including 2 Reuters journalists killed. Then the Afghan War Diary followed by the Iraqi War Logs. Huge amounts of documents. Then the ""US diplomatic cables leaks"" which contained more than a few important stories, maybe you heard about them? These we followed by the The Guantánamo Files which revealed that hundreds of innocent Afghan farmers were held for years there without being charged.

2534515,comment,2533655,2534269,9,0,acangiano,,,"In my opinion, some of your biggest strengths are also what leaves room for competitors.<p>For example, you focus on Silicon Valley where you are extremely well connected. Competitors could do very well by simply focusing on less glamorous, but emerging startup hubs.<p>You require people to relocate to Silicon Valley for a few months. This shows commitment from both parties and is a smart choice for you, but it also makes the program inflexible and unsuitable for a great deal of talented, perhaps more experienced people who cannot easily relocate. Your typical candidate is a student who is fresh out of college. Your competitors may capture the value in other demographics which have less flexibility when it comes to relocation, ability to quit their job, and so on.<p>Imagine an Untyped Lambda which offers similar terms to yours, but is also very flexible. You don't have to relocate (you can work remotely). Oh, and you can also apply if you are going to do this part-time, if at the moment you are employed and want to see where the startup goes before quitting your job.<p>You may think that this idea is grounds for a complete disaster, that such candidates might not committed, and so on - but perhaps, just maybe, such a degree of flexibility would lead to all sorts of new talent giving entrepreneurship a honest shot.<p>I'm not advocating that you do all that, but rather that a smart competitor may use it to their advantage.",1305070789

Hiding the truth of their situation and brushing it under the rug won't make anything better.  The fact that it's in the open now hopefully will motivate.<p>2.  About the government becoming less open -- they are incredibly closed off as it is (to the outside), how would they be any less open?  If being more closed internally due to fear of leakage is worth the cost of potential poor communication across agencies and thus raising the risk of poor execution in times of crisis -- then that's a decision they have to make.  Truthfully the risk has always been there, Wikileaks' actions don't change anything other than bring awareness to that risk.  Personally I don't believe that fear is worth it.",1305070156

I pressed him for specifics, and he mentioned that he had visited his white girlfriend’s parents’ house the past Christmas, where the family had ""sat around cooking together and playing Scrabble."" This ordinary vision of suburban-American domesticity lingered with Mao: Here, at last, was the setting in which all that implicit knowledge--about social norms and propriety--had been transmitted. There was no cram school that taught these lessons.</i><p>What's beautiful about this ""ordinary vision"" is that it's a portrait of domestic tranquility and love, simple and unpretentious, not that it's some sort of cultural transmission conduit; and it's totallly perverse to even frame it that way.<p>Another:<p><i>One succinct evocation of the situation appeared in the comments section of a website called Yellowworld: ""If you’re East Asian, you need to attend a top-tier university to land a good high-paying gig. Even if you land that good high-paying gig, the white guy with the pedigree from a mediocre state university will somehow move ahead of you in the ranks simply because he’s white.""</i><p>The second, conditional sentence is the one that seems to get all the attention, but I've always felt that it's the first one, the premise, that deserves criticism. The article makes a head-fake toward it, but then lets it slide. This is the real problem with our culture: not that we aren't getting enough of the highest-paying or highest-status jobs, enough wealth, enough exposure, or enough recognition. The problem is that that's all we care about.<p>The tragic truth about putting everything into breaking through the ""bamboo ceiling,"" I suspect, is that it doesn't actually look any different on the other side of it.<p>None of this is to say that wealth, exposure, or recognition are inherently bad or wrong. 1 Timothy 6:10 says ""Love of money is the root of all evil."" Not money; love of it. It's our <i>preoccupation</i> with wealth, exposure, and recognition, our search for these to the exclusion of all else that leaves us with nothing truly substantial inside.<p>Yes, the author briefly mentions artistic pursuits in passing, but it's still in the framework of external measures of success. What's the takeaway?<p><i>And though the debate she sparked about Asian-American life has been of questionable value, we will need more people with the same kind of defiance, willing to push themselves into the spotlight and to make some noise, to beat people up, to seduce women, to make mistakes, to become entrepreneurs, to stop doggedly pursuing official paper emblems attesting to their worthiness, to stop thinking those scraps of paper will secure anyone’s happiness, and to dare to be interesting.</i><p>""[Be] interesting,"" he says.

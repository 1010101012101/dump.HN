Robert Scoble, as far as I recall, was trying to download all his contacts and all their information out of Facebook.  And this is a little bit different to what we're doing.

231375,comment,231255,231255,0,0,morisy,,,"Just to play Devil's Advocate here, I think the article has some serious flaws while making some great, fundamental points.<p>The biggest flaw? Stealing an underdog's strategy when you're not the underdog just doesn't make sense. Mac had almost no enterprise (outside of a few verticals) deployments when they decided to scrap it all and go for broke. Their customers were used to having to upgrade software (think Adobe, sound editing programs, Quark) every few years anyways, and they had those companies buy-in for the upgrade.<p>Contrast that to Windows where if they did, as the author suggests, start over from scratch, that would provide a HUGE opening to Mac and Linux. They would essentially be giving up their dominant market advantage. And for what?<p>Have they been hurting some? Sure. Vista's reception, while not a total disaster, has been lackluster at best, but their growth in other areas (home consoles, media centers) is strong, and their enterprise play is still a near strangle-hold (sure, you got a few oddballs running Mac, but very few enterprise grade deployments, where the real money in licensing and support is).<p>Why would they give all that up to copy-cat (and probably a poorer copy cat) their competitors' strategies?",1214765945
231374,comment,231255,231255,0,0,Lagged2Death,,,"The best solution is ... starting over? Really?<p>Because Microsoft actually did that at least once, and this writer apparently missed it. They called it Windows NT. Windows Vista isn't version 12, it's NT 6.0. (Open a command prompt and see.) Which is why the next version is called Windows 7.<p>The author actually suggests that MS should write a new OS and run old code on some sort of VM or compatibility layer, apparently entirely unaware that every modern Windows PC already does pretty much exactly that.<p>Love it or hate it, Microsoft's devotion to backward compatibility is a big part of what got it where it is now. There are upsides and downsides to everything.<p>I don't even like Microsoft. But the insanity that gets hurled its way is ridiculous.",1214765864

I would bet that you have an opinion on nuclear power, despite never having built a reactor in your back yard.<p>Society pays quite a lot towards the cost of children as well (depending on where you are). For example here roughly 10% of income is taxed to pay for universal healthcare, of which a large chunk goes to subsidised and free care for children. If society is picking up part of the bills it should get part of the credit.<p>(And I don't play Halo, nor am I single. I'm not even that young.

Stories get one free upvote, so p-1 compensates for that (new stories have no points). Dividing by a power of time makes the number of upvotes that a story receives in its first few hours crucial to how likely the story is to stay on the front page.<p>In reddit's system, if you take a snapshot of the front page and then stop voting or submitting stories, the page will never change. At HN, stories might reorder themselves because a story with few points, which was given a boost from being very new, will lose rating compared to high-value stories that have been around a long time.",1214765601

231362,comment,231265,231265,0,0,pina,,,"I would use this for my people search application. This would definitely bring costs down significantly. The economics actually work the same if you want to do a really good job (be comprehensive) with your search application, you need to crawl the entire web to find the documents (part of the vertical) your search application is interested in. You could use a white list of sites, but then that would not be comprehensive.<p>So, building a good vertical search engine is really hard, you have to crawl the entire web first to find documents that look like the ones you are interested in. At 100 billion documents, 20k bytes each:<p>Bandwidth = 100 Billion documents * 20k bytes each = 1.8PB
To download the documents at wire speed (gigabyte speed) it would take over 230 days.

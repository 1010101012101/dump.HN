On Multics, after they got 8 rings in hardware, user code ran in ring 4, the email system ran in an intermediate ring but that wasn't critical and a very few people built systems with sandboxes in ring 5.<p>Ah, sandboxes could be another example.  Wikipedia says the \nGoogle Native Client overhead (presumably on x86_32) is 5%, although I seem to remember a higher figure.  But of course you need to be running on an operating system that uses rings and Linus didn't take advantage of the 386's ring system (which turned out to be very good for portability, as noted even to x86_64).",1316346946

3009985,comment,3009134,3009898,4,0,irahul,,,"> Isn't that the point of searching: find a specific thing in a whole bag of other things?<p>Web search isn't as simple as you make out to be. It's not a 'select * from blah where field like %like%'. Searching is about finding relevant information. Keywords are taken into account, but again, it's not a giant hashtable.<p>If I search for 'python file system watch', it shows me results for 'monitor' as well. Most of the cases, the keywords are the means to find the end result.<p>When you enter the queryterms, they pass through a lot of filters - removal of stopwords, n-gram tagging, spell check, hyponyms/hypernyms translations, lemmatization...before hitting the index. And then the ranking itself is quite complex.<p>And it's simply that sometimes 1 or 2 out of n query terms doesn't make it to the first page.<p>I don't work for Google and I don't know about how Google does it, but the notion that Google is ORing query terms is absurd. It just can't be. If Google were ORing query terms, you would never find MIT if you searched for ""massachusetts institute of technology"" or vice-versa.<p>> If you were right, Google would have done this from the start; why are they doing it now?<p>Once again, they aren't ORing query terms. The missing terms are falling out of the front page due to low rank.<p>> I don't use Google to find the Yahoo homepage (I know many people actually do; should we help them???)<p>Nothing special needs to be done for them. The generic ranking works great.<p>> If you were right, Altavista would have prevailed and Google would not have emerged; the way Altavista worked was, they linked the words in a query with the ""OR"" operator, so that any query produced at least some results, however irrelevant.<p>Google prevailed because of better ranking algorithm.<p>> (Could it be because focus groups are taking over?)<p>Focus group doesn't decide how algorithmic search works.",1316344860

Any jury, technical or not, should find 1A for Oracle.<p>""Has Oracle proven that Google has infringed the overall structure, sequence and organization of copyrighted works?""<p>As far as I can tell nobody disputes that Google lifted the Java API's structure, sequence, and organization from Sun, and the judge told them to consider SSO copyrightable.  Most programmers think it's ok to rip off an API because otherwise the world will burn, or something, but 1A is asking what Google did not whether it was illegal.<p>My bet is the jury is held up on the fair use, either for implementation (1B) or documentation (2B).  These are vague questions that can easily go either way.  My bet is that they find 1B for Google (implementing the API is ok) but find 2B for Oracle (reprinting the API SSO is not ok).

Criminal penalties as deterrent <i>do</i> work up to a certain point, and there is nothing wrong with embracing them to a civilized and practical degree. But the retributive nature of the American justice system is beyond fetishistic. This is harmful for two reasons.<p>First, evidence suggests that draconian penalties are counterproductive as a deterrent. The exact psychological reasons for this are being researched, but it is thought that it is a matter of respect for the rule of law. When people perceive a law as unjust and disproportionate, they are more likely to break that law, and that applies to the punishment as well as the crime. It seems paradoxical, but increasing the penalty for a crime beyond what people view as equitable will actually <i>reduce</i> the deterrent effect of the penalty.<p>Second, we as a society have become so obsessed with retributive sentencing that we will, to that end, actively cut programs that are proven to reduce crime. Any program that helps felons to get legitimate work once they are out of prison is likely to be attacked as ""soft on crime"" and ""wasteful"", even though such programs are usually relatively inexpensive and actually save the government money in the long run by reducing recidivism.<p>It is not hard to understand why giving ex-convicts non-criminal career opportunities is good for society, yet the idea that we <i>should</i> at least throw a couple of bones in that direction is actually quite controversial.",1336165342

That's why I specifically said this isn't your home, your place of business, or a public place.<p>But if you find something on somebody else's property, you can find the owner while still on the property or give it  to the person in charge of the property. Taking it off the property puts a very big responsibility on your shoulders to do the right thing in a tearing hurry or be judged a thief.<p>To me it is very simple. You can find lost property in a public place. You cannot find lost property on somebody else's property. The owner may have lost it, but you can't take it away.

This isn't the airline raising fares, it is simply the cheap seats get sold out.<p>Finally, there are fare rules. The cheapest fares generally have 14 or 7 day advanced purchase requirements. So without touching anything, fares will go up at those time increments as the cheapest fares are no longer available, even if seats are still available.

Do you really think all those ""normals"" really like Brangelina, Eminem, and Kobe Bryant? Hell no. In the ""real"" world everyone learns about things, and talks about things that do not interest them for the sake of socialization. Nerds seem to think they're the only ones who find these things dull and pointless - but here's the trick: so does everyone else! The difference is that normal people are willing to suck it up for the sake of staying in the social graph, while nerds don't. ""Normals"" acknowledge that in order to participate in this society, there will be a mix of shit that interests them vs. shit that doesn't.<p>The extension of that...<p>> <i>""just to get the attention of a bunch of kids who like boring stuff?""</i><p>... which proves my point. Nerds lord their intelligence over other people, while being generally clueless as to how ""normals"" operate. They're not people, they're kids who like boring stuff. I'm such a unique snowflake, only <i>I</i> can see how boring all this celeb gossip is - clearly those dim-witted normal people actually <i>like</i> this shit. If you actually took the time and participated in society at large you'll know as well as everyone else that socialization is a great deal of give and take, and that what people object to isn't your boring interests, it's your complete unwillingness to participate in <i>their</i> boring interests.<p>I've had the opportunity to talk about things other people are interested in - the general rule is, if you show interest in what they're doing, they will reciprocate. A lot of the hostility that nerds get from the world at large is simply a direct reflection of the hostility they show the rest of the world.<p>> <i>""Why not do stuff we find interesting, like math or reading,""</i><p>Surprise: the rest of the world does these things too. Especially reading. Like I've said above: their acceptance of your weird/boring interests is positively correlated with <i>your</i> acceptance of their weird/boring interests.<p>If nerds in general would just stop behaving as if they're kings of the universe, better than everyone else, they would ostracized a lot less.

But, although I haven't studied this event all that carefully, there is a difference between corporate espionage or some sort of malicious attempt at blatantly undermining Apple -- and the way Gizmodo presented their story, afaik. Gizmodo almost seemed to poke fun at the weird circumstances of the prototype being left behind (the photos of the bar and all that). Did they reveal any trade secrets about Apple (the phone being turned off remotely and all)? Maybe, perhaps they're at fault for that.<p>But making fun of a company, satire, should be protected by journalistic rights. Should, for instance, the Daily Show be prosecuted if they go after an interview and someone at the pentagon accidentally reveals classified information? It could be argued that Gizmodo knew the phone had 'fallen off the back of a truck' so to speak -- but their story seemed as much about the falling off of the back of the truck as the item itself.<p>At what point is there some (perhaps small) burden of responsibility on the people who messed up and lost the prototype? It doesn't seem like complete justice that suddenly Apple gets to come down hard with laws that aren't exactly clearly adjudicated yet. I mean if there were precedent -- if it were clearly known that anytime you come across a prototype, you run the risk of being prosecuted for not returning it to the company immediately, then OK, Gizmodo would be at fault. Maybe there is and I just don't know.<p>I get the sense that Apple has decided not to fault Gary Powell because that would be sort of a ridiculous move (see Steve Wozniak's thoughts at gizmodo). But that doesn't necessarily give them the right to take out their frustrations on Gizmodo. An engineer made a mistake. If anything, it's added publicity. Move on.",1272319936

Not to be all anecdotal or anything, but the top 6 GPA ranked people in my high school class were normal.  They weren't popular, but they certainly weren't nerds.  I was 7th, and I didn't really count as a ""nerd"" until college, when I started going to anime club.  In high school, I was so socially awkward that even the nerds wouldn't let me play DnD with them.  The nerds were all kind of middle-of-the-pack intelligence.<p>I suspect that we believe this because there are some powerfully intelligent and powerfully nerdy folks out there.  But if you just look at academic performance, I bet the reality isn't so strong.  There are a lot of dumb nerds out there.",1272319259

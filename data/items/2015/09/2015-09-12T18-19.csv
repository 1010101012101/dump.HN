10208929,comment,10208491,10208746,0,0,danso,,,"I couldn&#x27;t find anything in the study that shows how friendship is defined within in anonymized data set:<p>> Facebook provided data on every friendship formed in 2011 in every country in the world at the national aggregate level. These data set included a total of 57,457,192,520 friendships.<p>So there&#x27;s a few problems with language here...one of them being...what does &quot;every friendship formed in 2011&quot; mean? The friendship was actually <i>made</i> in 2011? Or that the friendship record existed as of the 2011 snapshot of the database? I&#x27;d have to imagine the former but if it&#x27;s just the latter...then &quot;friendships made by all users in one given year&quot; is massively different than &quot;all friendships of all users&quot;.<p>Second, in 2011, FB&#x27;s interface was different than it is today. Maybe they&#x27;ve always had this data in the backend...but were users able to have multiple locations listed as part of their user profile in 2011? My hazy recollection is that you were able to list your location...and after the Dec. 2011 roll out of Timeline [1], then you started being much more granular about your life and location, because Facebook wants to be the yearbook of your life or something.<p>If we assume that an international friendship is made by two users who have locations in two different countries...OK...well, anecdotally speaking, I went to a Midwest college..we didn&#x27;t have FB at the time but I imagine if we did, most/many students would have put the university as their current location/network. Even though the number of international friends I had substantially increased, if the data isn&#x27;t captured at a granular level, it just looks like I made friends with a whole bunch more midwesterners.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/timeline-now-available-worldwide/10150408488962131"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/timeline-now-availab...</a>",1442084295

From a casual user&#x27;s perspective, it seems to optimize for (what is to me) the wrong thing, which is readability over maintainability. Without the ability to create abstractions we run the risk of having to re-learn the lessons of the past, about DRY and SRP and all that jazz. While more language features give users more rope to hang themselves with, less language features constrict the ability of larger projects to manage complexity, such as is the case with dynamic languages. For Go, I sense that this will become more obvious over time.<p>TLDR; Readable code is nice, but maintainable code is better.",1442084275

Wooden bookshelves in iBooks might not have had much function, but the shading and glassy look on controls certainly did.<p>As an example, coming from the angle of an individual who&#x27;d never approached a smartphone in his life, the function of the iOS 6 picker/spinner was immediately obvious. The shading and glassy highlights made it look like a real spinner and practically begged the user to interact with it. Distinct section separators made it perfectly clear that each section can be spun separately.<p>Compare this to the picker in iOS 7 and up. Not only is there no shading or highlights to suggest how to interact with it, but now there are no separators — even if one presumes that it can be spun, it looks like the whole thing would spin. To make things worse, oddly skeumorphic 3D perspective has been added into the mix, presumably to try to suggest spinnability, but without partner cues it&#x27;s just confusing. With this design, so much is left unknown until the user attempts interaction.<p>Reference screenshot:

There was a funny post a couple years ago weighing a bunch of languages on republican/conservative vs. democrat/liberal scale. But the author erred with Go. Go is certainly the most republican conservative language out there today.<p>Go not only adopts the anti-intellectual stance but comes across as a language that&#x27;s controlled by &quot;religious leaders&quot; who dictate not only the the direction of the language but its &quot;morality&quot; too. And those who use the language feel the same hidden pressures from constraints. This leads to a weird state of having to &quot;believe&quot; in a language and defending things: &quot;like less is more&quot;, &quot;choices are bad&quot;, and having others determining what you want and need.<p>And this is the most annoying part. Because Go is really not a bad language. It&#x27;s simple and constrained but easy to get into and easy to get stuff done.

Certain parts are easily modelled with digital circuits. Certain parts could benefit from continuous, simple, parallel processing. An analog domain. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s tricky to find the right split and integration scheme esp if you&#x27;re targeting CNN&#x27;s like I read about here. Good luck on that as I&#x27;m sure it will make similarly interesting reading and potentially a useful product if I need CNN&#x27;s. :)<p>&quot;Because, if software is good enough, then why take a risk on a fancy new hardware component?&quot;<p>Good point. Something that&#x27;s done in many. Gotta have a clear benefit esp in price/performance/energy. This market has almost as many shut-downs as start-ups.",1442081264

It&#x27;s not cheap to get a license, and they certainly wouldn&#x27;t give a testing license in order to publish benchmarks against it, but in finance it is the standard for TSDBs.

There are normally all sorts of incentives and written into the contract.  For example, bonuses might be paid if particular milestones are achieved ahead of schedule, or if certain costs come in below estimates.  Also, there are usually limits on reimbursement (typically at the level of components rather than the entire project).<p>If used properly, these incentives and restrictions make it in the contractor's best interest to control costs.  I've never seen them used perfectly, but they're often used reasonably well.  I've also seen incentives that were designed so poorly that the contractor just ignored them because they weren't worth the effort to try and earn.<p>I think the main problem is that cost-plus pricing is often used in circumstances where it is not appropriate.  Cost-plus should generally be used only for high-risk projects.",1321865952

If you mean $5.00, the best solution is Paypal (or Stripe if you live in the US).  If you mean $0.05, stop now.<p>Tips:<p>1)  Don't call anything a donation if you're not a registered 501c tax exempt charity.  (You won't be.)  Instead, let people buy a supporter button on your home page or a ""registered"" version of the software with whatever trivial difference you want.  (e.g. displays ""registered"" or ""Thank you!"" in the about screen.)  This is a preventative inoculation against lots of trouble down the line with your credit card processor.<p>2) If you don't have a specific reason for forming the LLC, skip it and take money as an individual.  Many devs have an inchoate fear that this is somehow illegal.  That is the opposite of the truth: sole proprietorship is overwhelmingly the most common form of business operation in the US.<p>3)  Do not encourage people to pick their donation amount.  Instead, pre-pick three, which you can assign three levels of status to (bronze, silver, gold, whatever -- you and I know it is meaningless, but the customer won't perceive it that way) and price them at modest, generous, and high.  e.g. If you are thinking $5 right now, I would suggest $10, $20, $30 or $10, $25, $50.  You'll get most of your transactions at silver and make most of your money on gold.",1321865113

The only thing you <i>can</i> do is do it secretly and there are practically two ways to accomplish that.<p>The first way is hard to do if there's a large group of programmers working on the project but it's very suitable for older projects that is still under development but with lower staffing.<p>If possible, do things efficiently locally (use source control, use python/jython, generate code, do automated builds, do automated testing, reuse, and only deliver what you must) but leave your advantageous practices unadvertised. Then, slowly abuse your edge to steal maintenance and refactoring time from actual to-be-done tasks and features. Eventually you can ease your own future work and you'll get more time to work on the system instead of the features which become easier to add.<p>The second way is to employ a targeted attack against a whole malfunctional group or team at once: skunkworks projects. Do the damn thing from the scratch and do it right, then replace the old steaming pile of junk with it before anyone gets to say no, and weasel your way back to the surface by toting things were just changed a bit, and never replaced.<p>Of course, this comes with the assumption that the evil is in the system and your colleagues aren't actively demolishing everything you build.",1321864980

Due to their laziness the script will be undocumented, lack basic error checking, will have myriads of bugs and often fail, but no one except them will be able to fix it in a reasonable time frame.<p>Can you provide me with a link to <i>any</i> non-toy programming language for which this isn't the case?  I've seen beautiful code in a lot of languages, and I've seen god-awful ugly code in a lot more.  I don't think I've ever found a language that doesn't have some ugly code written in it, though.<p>> This is where you will be upset and think i am really unjust and a troll: I'm stating that Perl supports this behavior like no other language. (except maybe brainfuck ;) )<p>Well, when you offer up a statement that applies to essentially every programming language in existence, and then suggest that it only really applies to Perl, I can see where they might get that impression.  A programming language is just a programming language.  It's programmers that write it, and a poor programming can, and will, write piss-poor code in any language.<p>> My basic statement about Perl: It is possible to write readable, tested and maintainable code in Perl. BUT it is hard if not impossible with just the base language. It is by far easier to get it wrong then to get it right in Perl for the newcomer or average programmer.<p>No offense, but that's just flat out silly.  First of, it's not at all hard to write readable, tested, and maintainable Perl in the ""base"" language.<p>Beyond that however, saying ""just the base"" language is very misleading and shows either ignorance or malice.  Perl, by design, maintains a moderate ""core"".  It doesn't ship with every module included.  That doesn't make it hard to access additional functionality (such as Moose, Test::More, and thousands of others).  That's a simple design decision, and isn't good or bad, it's simply a matter of trace-offs.<p>By your logic then, C is a horrible language, because it's almost impossible to write ""readable, tested and maintainable"" code with the base language, right?  I mean, it has no object oriented functionality, no testing framework, and a very minimal standard library.  What were they thinking?  How is anyone supposed to get work done with C?<p>Oh, right.  They get the libraries they need, and get stuff done.  Just like in Perl.  Only, in C you don't get CPAN to take 99% of the effort of finding and installing libraries out of the equation.",1321864726

That isn't an unreasonable number  there have been a number of recent games which hit that as well.

3260414,comment,3259686,3260146,17,0,lucasjung,,,"I don't know why this is getting downvoted.  This is pretty much <i>exactly</i> why the government (mostly DOD) uses cost-plus in some cases.<p>The pendulum in government acquisitions tends to swing along multiple axis: sometimes the trend is towards the government do the integration itself, sometimes the trend is towards contracting out the integration to a prime contractor; sometimes the trend is towards cost-plus, sometimes the trend is towards firm-fixed price.  Even though one way of doing things might be more popular at any given time, the other options are always considered and often used.<p>The choice of reimbursement structure (which is not just binary ""cost-plus"" or ""fixed-price,"" but rather an entire continuum) is based on risk projections.  If you insist on fixed price for a very risky project, contractors will bake that risk into their bids, pricing everything for the worst-case scenario.  If you don't get the worst-case scenario, you'll still end up paying for it, in which case you would have been better off under a cost-plus contract.  Conversely, if you pick the lowest bidder and they didn't bid conservatively enough, and then you <i>do</i> get the worst case scenario, they might very well run out of money, in which case you have a choice of either granting them more money or cancelling the project and eating the sunk costs when the contractor collapses.  So, for high-risk projects, cost-plus is generally the best way to go.<p>I think that the swinging of the pendulum is due in part to a succession of over-corrections: ""We used cost-plus too much and contractors wasted money!  Lets use fixed-price as much as possible from now on!""  Followed by ""We used fixed-price too much and ended up paying too much on most contracts!  Lets use cost-plus as much as possible from now on!"" and then back the other way.  However, I think that it's also driven by cycles of technological development: a lot of technology tends to go through phases where one generation of equipment really pushes the edge of what's feasible, and then the next generation mostly just matures and refines the technology used in the previous generation (e.g. Windows Vista and Windows 7).  During those ""pushing the edge"" phases, risk is higher and so cost-plus gets used more; during the ""mature and refine"" phases, risk is lower and so fixed-price gets used more.",1321863239
3260413,comment,3260203,3260203,25,0,thaumaturgy,,,"1. This is bad for antivirus vendors who want to continue doing the same ol' thing. McAfee, AVG, and others are still terrible, and Norton has got such a bad reputation that even though its recent products have improved (somewhat?), it will be a long time before independent consultants start recommending it again. So this is going to put pressure on these companies to do something newer and better, which is great.<p>2. But, it likely won't change what actually ships with new PCs, since PC vendors these days (Dell and Acer directly, Best Buy, Staples, and others) make their margins by shipping computers with a free trial version of McAfee or Norton in the hopes that the customer will be snookered into paying for the software. In our experience, most customers do end up buying it, since they don't know any better.<p>3. Although we recommend and love Microsoft Security Essentials, it is not perfect. Just last week we had to do a manual cleanup of infected register systems for a local business where both MalwareBytes and MSE missed major components of the virus. The leftover components were sufficient to re-infect the systems -- while running in Safe Mode. (This was XP, for those wondering.)<p>4. Malware developers still have a lot of tricks they haven't even tried yet, that honestly I'm surprised haven't shown up already.<p>5. Malware is largely a commercial industry now, so there will be financial pressure on malware developers to adopt new tactics to defeat the bundled antivirus.<p>6. But, antivirus technology also still has a lot of room to improve. Microsoft especially is in a unique position to do this because they can legally do things like repair infected or damaged components of Microsoft software from clean copies, which might be a legal gray area for independent companies. (I am not a lawyer and all that.) Microsoft has the capability and resources for example to develop software which can examine key operating system areas for anything that looks suspicious -- something which most antivirus software doesn't do now.<p>7. In our end of the business, it could be a mixed blessing. On the one hand, we lose money on every single virus cleanup that we do, and I hate charging people for it anyway. On the other, it does drive new customers to us and gives us the opportunity to really make a strong first impression. But I won't cry into my pillow at night if Microsoft somehow manages to eviscerate the malware industry.<p>8. But, I'm skeptical about rapid adoption. What we're seeing right now is more and more people trying to keep their computer-related costs down. We're <i>still</i> doing significant XP support -- probably over half of our Windows users, if I had to estimate -- and, earlier today, the only reason we were able to convince a client that they would actually be better off buying a new replacement system is because decent <i>IDE</i> hard drive upgrades right now just aren't worth it. If this trend continues, and if Windows 7 continues to be ""good enough"" for most people, it'll be years before we see enough adoption of Windows 8 to make a dent in malware, which gives the malware developers plenty of time to adapt. (But, I could be surprised. Then again, what I've seen so far of Windows 8 isn't exactly compelling.)<p>9. Finally, the best place right now to stop malware, in our opinion, is still the browser. Chrome + AdBlock Plus by itself typically prevents repeat malware cleanups. The major exception to this <i>was</i> Limewire.<p>So, basically: I don't think this will really have that much of an impact any time in the near future, but if it does, it will probably make malware nastier and antivirus software better, and it will still be business-as-usual for support companies, which means it won't really improve consumers' lives much.",1321863238

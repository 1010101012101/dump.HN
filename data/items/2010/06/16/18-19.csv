The central government had very little direct involvement in what we would today call ""personal law"" or ""social policy""; instead, these were organized into separate communities along religious lines.  Muslims, Jews, and various Christian denominations each had their own sets of institutions.<p>A more modern example is Belgium, which has a kind of double federalism, where regional governments for Flanders and Wallonia have territorial jurisdiction, and community governments for the French-, Flemish-, and German-speaking populations have separate ""social"" jurisdiction.<p>In these cases, the social jurisdiction was determined by religious or linguistic affiliation, with only a handful of communities and very limited mobility among them.  It would be very interesting to see such a system organized on a much more pluralistic and dynamic basis, in which people could charter their own communities and change their affiliations freely.",1276714396

So it depends on what other customers are doing, and if everyone else were idle, you'd get the same CPU in both plans. But the host machine is at least an 8-core beast, so one person bursting to 400% doesn't affect other customers as much as it would in other hosting platforms. Also, the main bottleneck in a VPS setup is RAM and I/O. Personally, I've never had a CPU shortage in the two years I've been with Linode ;)",1276714346

I never became a good tennis player (partly because I'm cross-eyed and therefore lack normal depth perception) but I've had amazing use of the tricks he taught me and a couple of years ago it helped me win the World Championship in NHL 2004.

Pretty much any development job possible from language engineering to ajax  can be found in banking.<p>At smaller firms you'll have a smaller number of roles, typically they'll be back-office stuff (settlement, position reconciliation etc.), front-office stuff (stuff that directly makes money, algo trading, risk management, etc.) and a few bit and pieces in between (exchange connectivity, etc).<p>In general the money you get in banking is more than you'll get doing the same role outside of banking. The most money is in front-office and the least in back-office, although the difference in base salary isn't generally huge, the bonus can be depending on the firm.<p>Not everyone is suited to front-office though, for a front-office role you'll need the social skills to deal with the traders, quants, etc and the work can be more stresful. When you have a bad deadline in back-office it's typically ""we need to get this work done by the end of the week for compliance reasons otherwise the regulator might give us a slap"", for front office it can well be ""we need to fix this right now as we're pissing money down the drain"". Life in the back-office is generally more laid back with shorter hours (depends on firm though). Front-office is where the fun is generally though and tends to have lots of smart people.<p>In either case you're also generally expected to do a certain amount of out-of-hours support (if you're code is being used out-of-hours), but how much varies a lot. You should ask about this in the interview. Also you probably want to avoid any role that involves a large amount of legacy code (this is probably true in any sector).<p>Salarywise for an experienced senior dev in a front office role at a small hedge fund/prop shop I'd expect a total package (base+bonus) in the region of $200-$300k. Remember that small hedge funds do have a high failure rate, but that should be taken into account by the higher salary.<p>If you're solidly competent C++ or Java programmer you shouldn't have a problem getting a job in the financial sector, especially if you're good at things like multi-threading, etc.<p>There's a couple of books I'd recommend ""So You Want To Be a Wall Street Programmer?"" by Andrey Butov  (a good overview but pretty light, you should be able to read it in a couple of hours) and ""capital markets for quantitative professionals"" by Alex Kuznetsov (a much heftier book but the first half is an introduction to financial markets and the second half is an introduction to the various bits of technology that you'd find in a bank).",1276714033

The market cap difference between Google and Apple are not all that relevant to the amount of money they choose to invest in development, acquisitions or marketing, the aspects that influence their ultimate ability to compete given the will to enter a market. Market influence, however, is a hugely different story. Google owns 90%+ of the web search market, comparable to Microsoft's daunting lead in the commodity PC OS or office productivity software markets. Google's search business is the core of Google's profitability, bringing in the lion's share of their revenue.<p>Let's compare to Apple, who doesn't have a majority share in any competitive market besides portable music players and digital music distribution. The actual share of revenues from these businesses is a small and shrinking fraction of Apple's income. The portable music player business is collapsing in the face of evolving consumer smart phones and mobile internet devices like the iPod Touch, and the digital music distribution is an insignificant part of Apple's revenue. All the areas in which Apple is making all their profits are either nascent markets like consumer tablets and mobile internet devices, or Apple is a relatively small player. To imply that Apple can use their position in these markets it doesn't dominate to unfairly move into other established markets needs a bit more supportive evidence than that.",1276713859

For it to be useful, you need to have a use-case for it.  Generally, once you've defined what the problem is that you're solving, you know about 80% of what the API needs to look like.  The rest is just a matter of iteration and trial and error.<p>The best way to get at this is to write an application that uses the API.  This should give you a pretty good idea of what kind of interface should be provided.  Alternatively, your customers should give you an idea of what they want the API to do.  Don't be afraid to ask probing questions if their needs are ambiguous.",1276711950

(The idea that the Founding Fathers were concerned about defending those tribes’ “culture, identity, and rights” is very sweet; actually, <i>King George III</i> tried to defend Indians’ rights by not letting settlers expand further into their territory.)  The term “domestic nations” came about <i>to describe</i> the tribes’ twilight-zone status of not exactly independent sovereign states and not exactly subject to the laws of the states in which their reservations existed either.<p>Tevis’s theory is that a bunch of people who are (a) not indigenous Americans, (b) not related to each other, and (c) not possessing anything resembling the semi-sovereign territories that Indian tribes used to have... that these people can get together, declare themselves to be a “domestic nation”, and have the same legal status of Indian tribes.

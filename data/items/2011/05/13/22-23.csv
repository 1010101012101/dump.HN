2546531,comment,2546171,2546341,6,0,runningdogx,,,"That would prevent de-duplication in the non-shared case, which as I understand it is important to Dropbox for increasing storage efficiency.  I suspect that is the primary reason why they don't have an option to ""store encryption key locally only"" in the client.  The excuse that users expect to be able to share and access files on the web can be overcome with a big scary warning indicating that is not possible when using client-side-only encryption keys.<p>Dropbox advocates TrueCrypt in one breath, but refuses to integrate client-only encryption keys in the client with the next breath.  Obviously they know what we all know: TrueCrypt presents a poor UX for non-technical users, and so most people won't use it even if it's recommended.  Then DropBox gets to be the hero for advocating TrueCrypt while they get de-dup efficiency because they know few people actually bother using TrueCrypt.<p>Any transfer of keys to dropbox, even temporally, means your data on dropbox should be considered insecure.  You have no way to know what's going on on the dropbox side.  The same issue arises for CAs that let customers generate SSL keys within a web interface, to avoid the nuisance of having to generate a key/cert/csr themselves and uploading that.  It doesn't matter if the CA promises never to store the private key.  It's insecure and it's bad practice.",1305327170

It isn't a general feeling of malaise, it's <i>somewhat</i> a lack of positive value on everything (ish).<p>It is a lack of momentum and a heavy inertia to stay miserable and avoid change. It becomes a sunk cost where it's almost impossible to change something <i>small</i> in your life, let alone something big or huge.<p>Your advice is naive, and tantamount to asking ""Have you thought about not being depressed, I hear that could work"". If it were as simple as thinking your way of depression, it wouldn't be such a problem.<p>The best advice I've ever encountered is to take care of the little things, like sleeping on time, remembering to eat every day, doing laundry and getting out of the house. These are often the first things to go and often the hardest to get back into the routine of doing. Once you can manage a day at a time, it's easier to start to try managing a week at a time.<p>Large changes won't matter if you can't take care of the smaller things in life that support you. Depression isn't one of those things you can snap out of, but one that you can gradually work yourself out of.<p>It's not fun or easy though.",1305326253

2546406,comment,2545062,2545062,2,0,fbailey,,,"Here's the story of a so called social media expert: My story. I've been working at various online projects, startups and agencies since 1998 (or 1999 I'm not sure). For the last 8 years I've mostly done consulting in the UX area and some related strategic areas (product development, focus, features...). More and more communities came to me with questions about their features , their UX issues and how to build communities. Since UX social design is pretty interesting, I was happy with that, but then something changed. In the last years more and more brands came to me and asked for social media advice, at first I resisted. I gave them advice, but I didn't see it as a strategic opportunity, by then we had grown to a small consultancy and I saw no moat or specific knowledge we could use.<p>Because ... well after all Social Media is easy isn't it? It's just using Facebook and Twitter and nearly everybody can do it. I'm a hacker (a nontechnical hacker who knows what lisp is and how to get a database to scale)  i thought marketing is stupid, I want to work on cool stuff.<p>But something happened in the last 2 years, I analyzed how the behaviour of users changed. I helped building brands on social media. I saw the difficulties of people that had active and succesful twitter accounts in developing a succesful strategy for a a company.<p>I now see Social Media Consulting as a central part of our business and we have a moat, it's knowledge. Managing a Facebook Account with 1.000.000 likes is not easy and it has nothing to do with using Facebook as a personal tool.\nThe term social media ist still stupid but I no longer have a problem calling myself a social media expert. Expertise is a relative term even a local Social Media expert with 800 followers might be perfect for his clients. \nUsing social platforms for strategic communication purposes is not easy.",1305324772

Or, at least segmenting that way when you perform the survival analysis (Haven't checked out noahnoahnoah's references yet, so they may mention this).<p>+Also, the other tricky thing is when it's a subscription service (3,6,12 month sort of thing). Main reason this introduces complications is that you need to account for a ""unsubscribe signal"" that may not sync well with the next prompt to renew. So rather than predict a survival likelihood at the unit of analysis (I assume monthly, maybe weekly) you need to generate a likelihood for the point in time when the user is prompted to renew (and again, you can also vary that to move it up before the real end of the subscription). It's not particularly hard to grasp at a general level, but it takes a lot of careful thinking of edge cases.*<p>*That description may be a little convoluted, to simplify: What happens when a 12mo subscription shows signs of leaving only 6mo in?",1305324732

If you don't trust your hash algorithm... pick a new one.<p>EDIT: It occurs to me that this whole notional improvement (the one from the article and my alternative) isn't as great as it might first seem: if an attacker gets the table of salt+password, <i>and</i> if the attacker knows the password to one account on the system, he can figure out what the nonce is by doing trial hashes using hash(nonce+salt_k+password_k), where salt_k and password_k are the known salts and passwords. In this way, he can figure out the nonce. Since you will very likely run into collisions when attempting to guess the nonce, you will have to have more than one known password, and you probably want to know something more about the nonce, e.g., its length, but fundamentally you're only increasing the difficulty of the attack by a small amount.<p>EDIT 2: thinking about it more, the right way around this is just to use a gigantic nonce.

People are probably much more cynical about government now than in most of modern American history.

The team needs to click, and if there are people that don't fit with the group dynamic socially, then that's already something working against you.<p>Fortunately the scene itself is pretty diverse.  There are enough different sorts of founders out there that hire people like them that there's a place for shy and outgoing people to find a place to do their thing.  I think the fallacy that kicked this off was that all founders are socialites.  But if you've got founders that are socialites, they'll probably do better off with a team that is too.<p>For the record, I had one job that I didn't get because I would have slowed the rest of the team down (in that case it was because the rest of the team was German and I wasn't yet fluent in German).  They were right not to hire me.  They may have ended up hiring someone less qualified than me, but that made their team more cohesive.",1224468081

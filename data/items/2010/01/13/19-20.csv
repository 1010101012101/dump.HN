It's not that genocide is sometimes good, it's that civilizations that commit genocide also do good things.<p>The Germany that produced the Jewish holocaust also invented rocket science, which indirectly led us to the space program, satellites, and a big chunk of our modern communications network.<p>Does this excuse genocide?

He says that the key factor was the large number of animal species in the old world that could be domesticated. So Europeans all had constant contact with animals and their diseases, which led to (1) more diseases, and (2) greater resistance (among those that survived). While in the Americas, with their relative lack of such species, the people had both fewer diseases (so they were less of a threat to the Europeans) and less resistance (so the Europeans were more of a threat to them).",1263412511

My thesis is, given any two sufficiently distant cultures, <i>any</i> interaction between them, no matter how principled, will be traumatic to the lesser culture.<p>That doesn't mean I approve of the side-effects of interaction, or that I'm a believer in social darwinism, or that we should kill a million people in order to make drugs to extend the lives of the billions of other humans. These are all extreme positions that I do NOT take. I'm simply pointing out the patterns from the past, which I fully expect to continue in the future. My personal opinions have no bearing on this anymore than whether or not I like the beach has anything to do with the migratory patterns of sea turtles. It's an observation, not a value judgement.<p>Even when I say I would send my kids to the schools and such, what I'm saying is that <i>we must do what we have to in order to survive as a species</i>. Not that I approve or somehow would be complicit in it. I'm saying that the personal attitude of survival and not moaning over things lost is what makes us able to move forward no matter what position we are in.<p>The more interesting question would be if the aliens arrived with all sorts of goodies, much like the Europeans did. What if we could eliminate death? Eliminate suffering? Live more fuller lives? But what if the interaction was bound to kill 90% of the population no matter how well it was handled?<p>I'm not in charge of making decisions like that and I quite plainly refuse to do so, even in a rhetorical sense. I'm much happier describing my personal reaction to such an event than trying to figure out what's best for an entire species over the long run. That's way above my pay grade.<p>But it's not a matter of me good, them bad. It's more like ""some cultures are better than others, and when two cultures get significantly far apart mixing them becomes extremely traumatic to the lesser one""<p>You want an answer to the Fermi Paradox? I think it's right here.",1263412134

That is, either (A) western civilization is good, and the things it has done were good, and the things it values are good values, etc., or (B) it's bad, and the things it has done were bad, and the things it values are bad values, etc.<p>Once this dichotomy is accepted, <i>any</i> evidence of goodness is proof of A, and <i>any</i> evidence of badness is proof of B.  If A is accepted, then nothing can be bad, and if B is accepted, then nothing can be good.  You get one guy saying ""Medicine good!"" and another saying ""Slavery bad!"" and they shout at each other forever.<p>In fact, A and B are both all-or-nothing cognitive distortions.<p>It's quite possible for the Native Americans to have been savages, and the Europeans to have been savages (with better weapons), and for one group of awful people to have murdered another group of awful people.<p>Losing doesn't make someone good, and neither does winning.<p>Having nice things today doesn't mean that genocide 400 years ago was a good idea.<p>Being good doesn't mean we came from good people or entirely good traditions.

It's because ordinary people need goods and services.  If we didn't, we could all stop working and stop buying things and live happily ever after.  Most of us aren't shareholders in any significant way; if we actually believed that businesses existed to serve shareholders, let's get rid of them!<p>The reason company officers should <i>act</i> as if they're beholden to shareholder value is because there's no economic check on their resource consumption otherwise.  It's easy to satisfy consumers: simply take lots of money from shareholders or the government, and give it to the people (a la AllAdvantage.com and several other dot-coms).  But that's not economically efficient: there's no check on the resources consumed, so there's no incentive to be efficient, and you eventually run out of money.  The profit motive ensures that businesses consume as little as possible and produce as much as possible, so as long as they <i>act</i> as if their goal is to maximize shareholder value, they maximize efficiency throughout the economy.<p>But over time, <i>acting</i> in the best interest of shareholders has been confused with <i>the goal</i> of the company is the best interest of shareholders.  The former is an instrumental goal; the latter is an inherent one.  And the inherent goal of corporations is not to maximize shareholder value, it's to provide useful goods and services as economically as possible.

1050829,comment,1048800,1048800,0,0,poutine,,,"Google probably has been wanting out of China for some time.   Like many companies it had felt pressure to be in the 'largest market of the world'.   The problem is that it really isn't equipped to compete with the likes of Baidu even if the playing field was level, which it isn't.   As a poster upthread noted the Chinese Internet is entertainment dominated and not information/search dominated like in the USA.  Just look at Baidu and you'll see videos, music, shopping and celebrity news where Baidu makes much of their revenue.  Google doesn't have this content and more importantly Google is bound by western business ethics that prohibit the violation of copyright that the Chinese content companies engage in.<p>Secondly, the deck is stacked.  There are no real opportunities to sell to the wider Chinese Internet audience for foreign companies.  The Chinese government considers information distribution and the Internet key to its rather tenuous hold on 1.5 billion people.   It will not let any foreign company participate in a significant way in this area.  Period.  On top of this is a system of corruption that foreign companies can't possible engage in.  Google indeed realizes this, that even if they could compete the rule of law doesn't protect them and their business will be given to their competitors. One needs only look at the Youtube experience in China and the rise of Tudou as a result.<p>Thirdly, even if Google was able to compete and the rule of law applied the market opportunity really isn't that big.  Of course you may sputter about this seemingly absurd statement given your week in China, however the facts don't add up.   Baidu is projecting about some $800M of revenue in 2010, assuming you trust that figure (you shouldn't trust any number coming out of China).  It seems around half of Baidu's revenue is from search where Google could participate.    Google has 17% of the Chinese search market in the latest figures I could see (significantly down, they're losing due to the first two points I've made above).   Doing the math this equates to some potential $73M in revenue for 2010.     Probably equivalent to what they get from Northern Ireland.<p>There is no upside for Google in China.<p>Adding to that depressing bottom line is the fact of the continuous attacks on the infrastructure,  the probable infiltration of Google by Chinese spies (see Wikileaks for more), the demands by the Chinese government for access to Google's logs and the beating that Google's reputation is taking in its important markets it's pretty obvious that the Google exec is fed up.  Leave China to the Chinese and return when there's rule of law is their likely strategy.<p>My background is as an Internet entrepreneur that worked on a startup in Beijing for the past couple of years, having recently returned to Canada after falling prey to many of these issues, though at a much smaller scale than Google of course.",1263409827

If google can show the Chinese government that their practices will prevent western business, then the confrontation can be useful.<p>Its not to say that a direct confrontation is the right move, but there is a balance point between direct accusation and giving the PRC a face saving way to make a small change.<p>The real question (in my mind) is: is google at the right balance point.",1263409418

Redirects through seven partners - most likely paying on net 30 terms and taking a cut of the revenue themselves for brokering - would reduce the money torrent to a long-delayed trickle.  Perhaps the intermediary partners are placing cookies for targeting purposes and therefore adding a bit to the revenue stream?<p>I'm also surprised that clicks are being generated from Google, of all places.  Faking the click from an affiliate of a comparison shopping site would be much more lucrative (higher PPC due to higher purchase intent) and much less likely to result in aggressive countermeasures (comparison shopping sites aren't Google.)",1263409379

It looks like the ""overbreeding"" is objectively true: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_birth_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_birth_rate</a> . As far as simpletons go, you tell me: is there any intelligence test you know of that routinely ranks people in Djibouti over people in Japan? If not, it sounds like your statement is unfounded.<p>The rest of your interpretation is also suspect. The places Victorians conquered weren't more advanced than the places the Victorians came from. Regardless of the reason, Europe was more technologically advanced than the rest of the world, and they used that advantage to conquer as much of the world as they could.<p>When you complain about how the Victorians ran things, you have to compare it to something. If you compare, e.g., the Congo in 1955 (<a href=""http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,866343,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,866343,00.html</a> ) to the Congo in 2008 (<a href=""http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1713275,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1713275,00.htm...</a> ) you get the idea. You might not like how imperialists run things--but they run things well because they run them for profit.

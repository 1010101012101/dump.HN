At least put information and resources for autoscaling in the Docs section of the site.<p>Acquiring resources only as long as you need them, and then releasing them when you're done, should be the standard service - complete user control should be the advanced feature set.  They already do this for websites on a single dyno: they spin them down when they're idle for a while.  But they don't do it with workers (what effect does the latency of starting a backup job up really have? it's already running in the background).",1284429580

1689096,comment,1688578,1688735,0,0,davcro,,,"> Could this be any more self-righteous?<p>I believe this self-righteous attitude regarding acquisitions comes from being a bootstrapped startup.  When you bootstrap your company starts with a valuation of zero.  The only way to increase your company's valuation is to start making a profit.  For the bootstrapped guys an acquisition offer means that your company has grown to the point where competitors feel threatened.  When you are in this position the only reason to sell is if your company is no longer growing (why sell now when your company will be worth more next year?).  That is a tragic situation.<p>The founders who raise money start with an expected valuation greater than zero.  Usually these guys can sell well before they ever meet the expected valuation.  I mean shit, the startup SocialThing! sold to AOL for $7 million while they were in private beta.  In other situations these companies fail to meet the expected valuation and have to sell in order to protect the reputation of the investors and founders.  For example Slide sold to Google for $183 million.  My company Quiz Monster (bootstrapped) is a competitor to Slide, has a larger userbase, and is worth $1.5 million at best.<p>TL;DR:  Bootstrapped companies have to work harder than venture backed companies in order to receive acquisition offers and thus feel very self-righteous.",1284429208

The man âgaveâ us the information that he has at least one male child. By this we mean that he asserted the statement âI have at least one male child.â Now our issue is when we confuse this with being âgivenâ that the man has at least one male child, in the sense that we should restrict to the set of universes in which the man has at least one male child. This is a very different statement than the previous one. For instance, it rules out universes where the man has two girls, but is lying to us.</i><p>No, we are assuming that the givens are facts that are true.<p>> <i>Even if we decide to ignore the possibility that the man is lying, we should note that most universes where the man has at least one son donât even involve him informing us of this fact, and so it may be the case that proportionally more universes where the man has two boys involve him telling us âI have at least one male childâ, relative to the proportion of such universes where the man has one boy and one girl. In this case the probability that he has two boys would end up being greater than 1/3.</i><p>No, we don't have to consider universes where the man has at least one male child but does not inform of us of this fact.  We have a set of givens that are assumed to be true, and based on those givens and the rules of logic, we can make justifiable statements of probabilities.",1284428456

You're probably going to have people that try to take advantage of this, but there are some people who make honest mistakes, and I would give them the benefit of the doubt.

In general, the one thing that people will remember for life is how you make them feel.<p>The benefits of providing awesome customer service outweighs the cost IMO (I haven't done the math, but that's my gut feeling).

There are no http requests then for the images, background, css, and so on, which is nice for the server.<p>That's all well and good, but then I have to go back and make that also all work for noscript users.

I'm considering SF/bay area for hopefully better opportunities, more outdoors stuff (surf and snowboarding), and less driving.<p>Here's what I noticed spending the last week working in SF, staying in outer richmond.:<p>* Transit - Compared to Austin, any transit system that is used by more than just students or poor people is good. My one complaint is that I still can't figure out if the bus system lets you buy a week or month pass (tried going to the ""clipper card"" website too).<p>* Outdoors - see comments below, but I'm basically happy with the variety. Austin is great for outdoors, but I feel like I reach a hard wall where I need to own a motorboat or be willing to drive a ways to do things beyond running around townlake/greenbelt. I also like how certain pockets of golden gate park seemed to hide you from the city (used to be the same in Austin, not so much now that we have more of a skyline). I liked walking to land's end in the evening  - you can escape in the greenbelt/twin falls in Austin, but only when there's water flowing.<p>* Cost of living - I'd like to hear from more HNer's about this. I'm still afraid of the cost of living out in SF, along with the economic situation. I did feel like many of the small grocery stores were fairly expensive (I'm assuming safeway is cheaper though).<p>other notes:<p>* Everything is beautiful, and everyone else wants to see it too - Crowds can be pretty long during labor day when driving out to the beach. We managed to avoid it, but still realized I'd have to get used to living with lots of people<p>* Hope you like hoodies - I came to SF after dealing with 100+ degree heat in Austin earlier this month, then was wearing a sweater/hoodie almost every day. I don't think this will bother me much.<p>* The mexican food sucks - Only tried Gordo's and Baja Fresh (which I used to love), but the food just isn't as greasy, spicy, or cheap as in austin. Maybe there's a gem like torchy's tacos out there?<p>* possible solution - try to drive less in austin. I'm considering staying in town, but move back to hyde park (north of ut) or barton springs (south of downtown). Downtown Austin is fairly recently built, and thus many of the nearby restaurants and establishments are new, but upper-class (read: expensive)",1284427180

Even with a modest-sized 40-person orchestra  (and overlooking the massed choir for Beethoven's Ninth) that's only $275 for what must be at least several days' work. Are ""world-reknowned"" orchestras really that hard up for cash?<p>Heck, if I can get a full orchestra to play me a symphony for a thousand bucks then I might just do it for fun.",1284426518

Originally if you uploaded anything but photos taken with a lensed camera (like illustrations or screenshots), your account would be marked so that everything you posted never appeared in searches or public site areas. This practice only stopped maybe 2 years ago.<p>They also finally redesigned the photo pages to display them larger than 400px wide. It's no longer lower-res than Facebook, but it's still much slower since they don't prefetch images.",1284426499

It seems like this would be legitimately useful tech for any site with legal media downloads, but the fact that the top of the site deliberately links to torrents of movies etc means it probably won't be used this way.<p>Does this technology expand the scope of who the authorities go after for piracy? Will takedown notices extend from beyond the torrent to the site that seeded the 'burn' of it? Or am I misinterpreting what it does?",1284426142

They boost your absolute count too. And that's OK. Karma measures popularity.",1184888331

Some readers are ignoring the comment field (not your fault, but that's the sad reality), change it to a description field and encode the link to the story and the link to the comments in that field.

35422,comment,35309,35309,0,0,palish,,,"Sheesh.. Why?  I don't understand why people keep trying to take something which is inherently non-object-oriented (Lisp) and cram an object-oriented mentality into it.  Sure, it's nifty you can make objects without using the Common Lisp Object System, but that's generally not how you'd want to structure an actual application, right?  Lisp is so powerful you can build and manipulate your own structures at runtime, so you don't need to make objects which represent a concept.  Those concepts are represented through utility functions.  Maybe I'm just dumb, but I don't see it.",1184886623

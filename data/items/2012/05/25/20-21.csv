4025340,comment,4025198,4025281,4,0,ssmall,,,"So whenever people ask me about Go, I try and get them to keep in mind this isn't meant to be a competitor to python/ruby or any of that.  Approach it from the mindset of a C guy and it will look amazing.  The biggest benefits over python/ruby are static typing and that it is compiled.  I know static typing isn't popular around here but it has its benefits.  I love go and I know web programming is possible in it, but I'd never use it for that.  To me it shines at system level services, embedded linux, and anything with high performances and reliability requirements without real time requirements.<p>We were actually having a talk today about using it here on an embedded Linux device we produce.

4025335,comment,4024020,4024839,2,0,rlander,,,"> Thanks for the feedback and for following Elixir all this time!<p>I've been closely following Elixir since it was announced and I should've made it clear that I still think Elixir is a fantastic project<p>At first I though it would be my doorway into Erlang programming (or Reia, at the time), with the familiar syntax and all, but eventually I learned Erlang and wound up actually enjoying it. Then, an opportunity arose to use Elixir but, because of its early stage (this was right between 0.3 and 0.4), I couldn't deploy it in a production environment, so I ended up choosing Clojure.<p>So now, between Erlang and Clojure, I can't see where I could justify using Elixir. It's just my personal experience, of course.<p>>  Unfortunately, extending the Erlang VM is nowhere close to extending the Java VM. :(<p>No need to; one could just adapt ClojureScript to spit out Erlang. It would depend on the JVM and wouldn't support native macros, but it would work ok, I guess.<p>> The problem with the OO approach is that OO didn't suit well an immutable language.<p>I think you made a very wise choice when you ditched OO. I'm all for functional & immutable.<p>> We are exchanging the OO familiarity by a better/tighter integration with Erlang runtime, which will, hopefully, be a good reason for people to try it out.<p>I understand it might be premature, but I would love to know what kind of projects/developers is Elixir attracting?",1337979349
4025334,comment,4025081,4025297,7,0,emelski,,,"You can use the MVP concept, even on a very mature product.  You just have to adjust the scope of the idea.  For example, my product has been in development for more than 10 years and has had 24 major releases.  Yet when we are considering adding a new feature, we still scope the work in terms of the minimum usable version of the feature, as well as the ""100% version"", hopefully with a few reasonable steps in between.  This enables us to focus on getting something useful out quickly, in order to validate the feature, while avoiding gold plating until we have that validation.",1337979328
4025333,comment,4023723,4024409,4,0,JackC,,,"Hmm. I agree that it's normalized (as you said below), and not controversial to lots of people. But I think that's because people are mostly fine with casual sexism, as long as it's not too obvious.<p>So think about this. You've seen it applied to both genders. How is it applied to men? ""Whiny little bitch""; ""I'm gonna make you my bitch""; ""Suck it, bitch""; ""Stop bitching ..."" Here's what those phrases mean to people, not in the past but today: ""you're acting like a weak, pathetic woman""; ""I'm going to sexually dominate you like a woman"".<p>How is it applied to women? ""Stop your bitching."" ""Shut up, bitch."" ""She's such a bitch."" Can you guess how those ones come across? ""Shut up, stop complaining, and smile the way you're supposed to."" ""I own you; do what I say."" ""She doesn't act the way women should.""<p>Right now (if you're not a terrible person :) you're already typing ""that's not what it means when I say it!"" And I sorta believe you, and that's great. But there's a reason that if you stop using ""bitch,"" you won't have a good word to replace it. ""Bitch"" is a powerful, useful word exactly because it's great for calling men women, and telling women to stay in their place. Those messages hit hard, because it hasn't been very long since women were literally property, so having a quick way to hit someone with them comes in handy. And you don't get to choose how people hear your words -- when you use it, that's what's lurking right under the surface, and it's what a lot of people will hear.<p>Go ahead and keep doing it if that's your thing. Even try to reclaim it. But some of us are going to think you're just another schmuck blindly supporting the idea that men are one way and women are another way and men should be in charge of women. I haven't used the word ""offensive"" here, because that makes it all about me. I'm not offended.* It doesn't <i>matter</i> if I'm offended. What matters is that words promote ideas, and the word ""bitch"" promotes a stupid idea, and you might not want to do that.<p>* (Offended is such a weak emotion anyway. I recommend self-righteous anger, bitter amusement, cold calculation or cynical detachment. No one is merely offended.)",1337979271

Same for Borderlands.<p>With hacked items, there was no point in playing a public game, because chances were high that one or more players had hacked items which allowed them to kill enemies in one shot, or made them virtually indestructible, thus trivializing the game. The end result was that you'd only risk playing with close friends, unless you finally gave in and used hacked items yourself just so you'd have a chance when playing with others.<p>Also, as rare items become as common as sand due to hacking, the marketplaces are ruined, since hacked ""super rare"" items depress prices to the point that it's only worthwhile to sell in bulk, which is only possible if you hack. It also causes bleed over into my previous point, as regular non-hacking users acquire hacked items via the marketplace without necessarily realizing it, and the game is further trivialized, with everyone decked out in super rares that they bought for 1000 gold each.

In fact, I kind of like R's syntax.<p>As an example, I like the ability to use expressions on the left side of an assignment (e.g. names(df) = ""stuff"").  But, it sounds like you are right that the python developers are getting to learn from R's mistakes and avoid getting locked into to legacy ideas.<p>As far as libraries... R has a lot.  So I don't expect python to totally catch up soon.  But, I only use 10 or 15 R libraries, and those are really popular libraries.  So, unless you do an incredible range of stuff, python probably doesn't hvae to completely catch up.<p>One major advantage for R is the package management system (CRAN).  The uniformity of the interface... the ability to search for stuff in it... that's been really useful for me.  Not sure if anything like that is in the works for python.<p>Lastly, there are a lot of little helper functions that I've written for myself in python that are part of base R.  The first example that comes to mind is head() to view the top few lines of a data structure.  It seems strange that python would be missing these little helper functions, but I never found it.",1337976521

The things about me is that I am a Hmong refugee from Thailand, uneducated, and had no background knowledge of American. At the ages of 13, I came to the United States not knowing a word in English. I started learning English alphabet and words when I arrived here. After a year of trying to learn English, I went straight to high school. That's when I realized how hard it was to live in a world where you don't understand what people are saying, but the situation force you to live with it. I have been in the same situation as you, which to live among others who could easily communicated to one another. I went to high school without friends and without talking to anyone for 2 years. after 2 years in high school, I was able to understand some simple conversations use in every day life and able to ask some questions. I was and still am the quietest guy in class. I am in college now and want to express myself more but couldn't do it because of the limited English I have. \ntchang",1337976245

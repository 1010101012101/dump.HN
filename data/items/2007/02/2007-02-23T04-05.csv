Sorry about that.<p>If anyone cares, it was because the http server is also written in Arc, on top of MzScheme, and we misread the MzScheme doc on make-limited-input-port to believe that limit-k referred to k of bytes.  In fact it refers to bytes.  So while we thought we were capping http requests at 2 meg, we were in fact capping them at 2k. ",1172206733

613,comment,363,410,0,0,danw,,,"EDIT: I should have said this is a submit article bookmarklet. I'm working on trying a like/dislike.<p>I've just made a realy quick and dirty bookmarklet. It's only tested in firefox 2 and it's not quite how I would like it to work but it's a start. I'll hopefully update it later to work better. <p>Just add the following URL as a bookmark:<p>javascript:(function(){var d=document;var b=d.body;var 
c=b.insertBefore(d.createElement('center'),b.firstChild);
var dv=c.appendChild(d.createElement('iframe'));dv.id='ifrm';
dv.height='30%';dv.width='100%';dv.src='http://news.ycombinator.com/submit';
d.getElementById('ifrm').scrollIntoView(); })(); <p>Let me know if it works.",1172206373

That and a promise of three-nines uptime.<p>I'm guessing they're going to make it easy to tie GMail into existing enterprise systems.<p>All in all, I think it's a very compelling offering.<p>",1172205228

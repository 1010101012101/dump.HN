9121320,comment,9120921,9120921,0,0,personlurking,,,"Today, I saw the following talk by Mario Vargas Llosa, the Nobel-prize winning author, where he talks about the decline of culture (from his novel, The Civilization of Entertainment). English subtitles available.<p>19 minutes
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWDgjPjp1S8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWDgjPjp1S8</a><p>Taken from an article on his novel...<p>What he sees playing out across the board, from literature to politics, from religion to eroticism, is a “ludic banalization” of the spheres of human thought and action. According to Vargas Llosa, we live in a “lite society that bestows the same supremacy on frivolity that in other times belonged to ideas and artistic production.” This frivolity “consists of an inverted or unbalanced set of values in which form is more important than content, appearance more important than substance, and where gesture and display—representation—take the place of feelings and ideas.”",1425070788

It will be much harder for challengers to enter the market now because of the increased cost of compliance, something only the big incumbents can afford. What&#x27;s worse is that the costs for Title II companies will be subsidized by government. So they may appear to have low prices, at least for awhile, but the real price will be hidden in a nebulous cloud of federal taxes. You won&#x27;t even really know how much you&#x27;re actually paying due to price distortions caused by corporate welfare. It&#x27;s sad that people have such a short term memory about these corporate welfare cons, and just fall in lockstep with the propaganda.

9121312,comment,9118012,9118012,0,0,simscitizen,,,"We wrote a tool like this in my last job to guess the width of raw images like these. First, we were dealing with iOS, and there are certain constraints on the platform which help with guessing width (bitmaps are generally 32-bit BGRA, and the rows in iOS bitmap images are aligned to 32 bytes). Because of the alignment constraint you only have to guess the width in 8-pixel increments. Then pick the width that minimizes the average pixel difference between adjacent rows in the image. This usually guessed the width of the original image (or an integer multiple of the actual width), at least when the original image was a UI element (as UI elements generally have large rectangular blocks of color in them).",1425070730

It&#x27;s debatable how often things actually work that way, but that&#x27;s the idea. On one hand, this increases your personal responsibility (you can&#x27;t use &quot;following orders&quot; as an excuse) as a professional. On the other, the professional is protected by boards and certifications and limits on the labor supply that give him leverage, because even if he&#x27;s fired, he&#x27;s still certified as being worth a damn. If anyone can enter the labor market, then bosses become the sole source/record of credibility-- getting laid off is no big deal, but a bad reference can and a career-- and hold all the cards, which means that employees have no moral agency. On the other hand, if there&#x27;s a minimum level of credibility to be part of the profession, then (at least in theory) each professional has sufficient credibility to work independently and therefore has no reason to fear management, and therefore can push back against unethical orders (and is required to do so).<p>I think it&#x27;s obvious that the VCs and the wage-fixing tech barons of Silicon Valley would fight such a structure, should it emerge, with all that they&#x27;ve got. They hold all the cards now, and a union or professional guild would threaten that, and they&#x27;re very good at convincing a surprising percentage of engineers (perhaps due to the age discrimination culture, which favors naivete over experience) that interests are aligned between the side of the tech barons and investors and serial founders and that of the engineers, never mind any evidence to the contrary.",1425070518

People think Ruby is fantastic and I think it&#x27;s pretty horrible, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re ignorant of other languages, they&#x27;ve just developed different tastes.<p>> So your position is that we should take away features that people overuse?<p>Some of them, yes.  Go doesn&#x27;t have the ternary operator.  I consider that a good thing.  I&#x27;ve seen critical security bugs that had been in production code for years because someone misused the ternary operator in a way that never would have happened with a boring old if/else.<p>> So, lacking justification, you just segment off what you&#x27;re saying into the realm of opinion, where if you believe hard enough anything you want can be true!<p>I&#x27;m saying that what makes a language good or bad is generally subjective.  I don&#x27;t think you can objectively say one language is better than any other except in extreme cases.  Is Haskell better than Python?  Is C# better than OCaml?  It&#x27;s like asking if minvans are better than sports cars... it depends on what you want to do with them and what you enjoy.  I used to like to floor it getting on the highway and hearing the engine rev as I was pushed back into the seat of my v6-powered sedan... now I take great satisfaction in throwing a new couch in the bed of my truck and not having to wait or pay for delivery.  Is my truck better than my sedan was?  Would my truck be better if it had the same 0-60 time as my old car?  Sure... it would also cost like $15k more.  There are always tradeoffs.<p>You say the Go community is being blind to the benefits of generics, and we say you&#x27;re being blind to the costs of generics.  And I don&#x27;t mean compiler complexity or speed.  I don&#x27;t give a fig about the compiler.  I care about the complexity of the <i>code</i>.

9121161,comment,9119162,9119162,0,0,Arathorn,,,"IRC&#x27;s longevity and appeal is fascinating - it seems like that the more constrained the bandwidth of communication, the more compact the configuration, and the more quirky and charismatic everyone&#x27;s favourite clients (be they irssi, weechat, mIRC, xchat...) the more staying power a comms medium has.  My workplace started off life ~15 years ago as a channel on a small student IRC network - the company effectively evolved out of IRC.  The importance of IRC bots (be they eggdrops, or pircbot, or whatever) also seems to have become core to IRC culture - a well implemented IRC bot can be an incredibly powerful tool for glueing a community together.<p>All this makes it incredibly hard when considering what could come after IRC, if anything.  XMPP&#x27;s MUCs just don&#x27;t seem to have the same sticking power, and meanwhile things like Slack and HipChat come along and risk hijacking all our comms into closed silos rather than the relative openness of IRC and XMPP.<p>Regardless, after 15 years of addiction to IRC we&#x27;re having a go at coming up with something better that still has some of the same appeal.  The project is called Matrix.org, and the main differences to IRC are:<p>* Open federation; anyone can spin up a server and join in.
 * Conversation history (i.e. scrollback) is the main building block - a room&#x27;s history is stored (partially or completely) over all the servers who are participating in a room.  So there&#x27;s no single point of control or failure.
 * Compulsory cryptographically signed message history (necessary due to the open federation)
 * Simple HTTP/JSON client-server API.  (Server-server API is also HTTPS/JSON)
 * Store arbitrary structured data in the room - not just text messages.  So you can use it for setting up VoIP calls; whiteboarding info; random device telemetry, or whatever.
 * Built-in distributed file storage (no more DCC, for better or worse)
 * Strong identity and end-to-end encryption (via a variant of Axolotl; currently in dev)
 * Support for 3rd party IDs - contact people based on their mail address, phone number, or whatever details folks chose to identify themselves by.<p>So if you like IRC and are interested in a fairly radical alternative, please drop by <a href=""http://matrix.org/beta"" rel=""nofollow"">http://matrix.org/beta</a> and say hi.  It&#x27;s in early beta, but it&#x27;s fairly usable - we have Android and iOS clients and SDKs for python, perl, iOS, Android and an increasingly active dev community.  Also, it&#x27;s not frozen yet, so now is a great chance to get involved and make sure we get it right :)",1425069304

In a world with 100 people, you can say that a system is sufficiently &#x27;decentralized&#x27; if 10 of the people ran nodes, independent of eachother, where if any of the nodes lied or crashed the system would continue to work, and where few or no nodes collude with each other. It doesn&#x27;t require every single one of the 100 people to hold the blockchain.<p>Bitcoin nodes is a bit like peer review of a dozen academics keeping each other in check, only it&#x27;s based on math and cryptography and proof of work. The proof of work ensures it&#x27;s not possible to lie to other nodes without expending lots of money on mining and risking not getting any reward in return when your blocks are rejected. And even if you lie, nodes can&#x27;t send money they don&#x27;t earn due to the public-key cryptography. And instead there are hundreds or even thousands of such nodes and miners, and we call that decentralized.<p>In other words you can run a decentralized system with thousands of copies of all transactions, as opposed to all 7 billion people needing to store a copy and relay every transaction to everyone else.<p>Beyond that, not all transactions need to even be stored by the nodes that are needed. If you sent me a dollar in 1990 and I spent that dollar, and whoever received it from me spent it and so on tens of thousands of times now in the past 25 years, then there&#x27;s absolutely no practical reason for me to store the data on our transaction in 1990. It can be pruned. And so can all the transactions between 1990 and 2014, and most transactions in 2015 of that particular dollar, except the last recent few.<p>Concerning security of the blockchain the vast majority (an ever growing number) of transaction data can be safely thrown away.<p>Some research universities and businesses might save that data for posterity/research/datamining, but for the network to operate, to function, you can prune something like 99% of the data.",1425068058

I would have preferred specifically-crafted legislation for the modern Internet, and not application of a &quot;forbeared&quot; Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.  And I too think the last mile problem is at least as interesting—I feel it&#x27;s even more important.<p>My preference would be for something very light-touch at first since in my opinion we haven&#x27;t seen much evidence of the weaponizing escalation you&#x27;ve illustrated in metaphor.  We&#x27;ve seen Comcact and Netflix bring knives to what was expected to be a boxing match.  In my opinion, the outcome was fine.  Without the metaphor: the market worked it out.  Given Comcast was in the middle, I assume many Comcast customers gave them a verbal lashing and some others actually voted with their wallet and switched to whatever the second option was for them (assuming they had a second option; see last mile problem).  A few people may have even decided to stream video not from Netflix but rather Amazon Prime or other services.<p>Given Netflix&#x27;s massive bandwidth needs, the metaphor is a bit more like Netflix&#x27;s whole boxing team showed up to the boxing match, so Comcast&#x27;s single boxer reached into his pocket and grabbed his knife.  Then the Netflix team grabbed their knives (by way of drumming up the ire of their user community).  And there was a bunch of blood spilled.  But ultimately, I think this process is acceptable.<p>Going back a few messages, we had been talking about what can be taken away from <i>hardware manufacturers</i> expressing concern about this regulatory change.  You had said of course they are concerned, for it is natural for them to worry that their next-generation hardware for a tiered-Internet is at risk of lower demand.  My premise is that implementing a tiered-Internet (whatever that is) is not much of an engineering challenge at this point.  I expect ongoing R&D for network hardware has been and continues to be principally about <i>how do we make this stuff faster, cheaper, better because our customers (ISPs and backbone providers) always want faster, cheaper, better.</i><p>Now they are presumably worried their customers won&#x27;t want faster, cheaper, better.<p>That gives me some concern.  My future Internet connectivity was supposed to be way better than my present.  But will it be only a little bit better?  Maybe even pretty much just the same?  Maybe I will be totally satisfied; I cannot predict the future.<p>But are these hardware vendors the canary in the coalmine?  Or are they shills for Comcast and the other evil ISPs?  I&#x27;m not sure, but they are definitely an integral part of making the Internet work so their opinion should not be so broadly rejected.",1425067627

My point is that with our massive amount of inner-connectivity today I want regulated assurances that my financial security or hardware wellbeing is handled by someone who is vetted professionally for being competent.<p>If the JS guy wants to go through the rigor to learn the tools to be a great security expert he should be able to. Heck, I wouldn&#x27;t refer to him as a &quot;JS guy&quot; at that point anymore either. I want an industry where there is a vetting process to prevent frauds or incompetence from creating issues prior to the issues existing. Some amount of assurance, or accountability. We currently sort of work on &quot;best-intentions&quot; in that regard.<p>Engineering in it&#x27;s traditional fields has gone through this growth pain. In some cases many lives were lost in the process of learning that there should be a regulatory body overseeing who is allowed to sell themselves as competent practitioners. Consider the state of OpenSSL when Heartbleed came about. There was most definitely a series of fundamental issues at play that weren&#x27;t brought to light until after its hayday, but as an industry we sort of have the mindset of &quot;these types of things are inevitable&quot;. I can&#x27;t say concretely where I stand on the matter but I do believe a higher level of accountability would be a net positive for public perception. This is a very loose example, its a complex topic that would take far longer to debate in full I think.<p>On the flip side too is the idea that &quot;Software Engineering&quot; becomes a protected field where its important. I mentioned my domain is control systems, but so many of the tools I work with are years behind more modern frameworks and technologies that are used outside my industry. I have embarrassingly low amounts of tools to test the programs I develop, its mostly a rigorous manual testing procedure that gets done to say I&#x27;m satisfied and I&#x27;m responsible for this application. I blame, in part, the fact that this work is more often done by Engineers in other domains. They don&#x27;t <i>know</i> what modern software development has overcome and created. Some of the routines and applications I inherited moving to this position were embarrassingly poor and thankfully never caused real-world harm mostly due to the numerous tiers of safeguards that exist in designs. Its like coding with exceptions but being fine with it because there&#x27;s a Catch somewhere higher in the operating environment.<p>I suppose I might be in the wrong place here as this is HN a more Startup-centric tech forum. I&#x27;ve long disagreed with the mindset that software engineers need to &quot;upset the established norm&quot; in a lot of fields. Medical is a big one lately that&#x27;s getting a lot of traction. There&#x27;s a balance that should exist between regulated gatekeeping of fields for the public good and legislated protection over fields to prevent outside interaction.<p>I feel I&#x27;ve ranted a bit. This truly is a complex topic which I think I&#x27;m still establishing a position on as I grow and get experience in the industry. I know where we are _currently_ isn&#x27;t right in the long run, but taking the term &quot;Engineer&quot; to be as by-the-book as possible to the traditional fields of engineering isn&#x27;t right either.",1425067468

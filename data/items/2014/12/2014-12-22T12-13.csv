Being a coder/PM, I really didn&#x27;t realize we were in it until it was already several months in.<p>I had left one gig and had started looking for the next one. One month I was getting multiple 6-figure full-time job offers. The next month the phone didn&#x27;t ring.<p>I ended up going back to basics: marketing. I went through the online job boards and found which skills were still selling, then revised my resume to focus on those. I made my pitch better and started to talking to recruiters.<p>It&#x27;s all still just a numbers game. There&#x27;s a funnel of jobs you apply for. The next level is the recruiter interview, then the tech interview. Different rate quotes get different amounts of volume into the top of the funnel.<p>I ended up taking a 30% cut from my rate before. That went on for a few months, then the next job was back at my normal rate. In fact, the more I worked the market the better my rates got. I took a big hit for the several months it took to re-tool, but in general within a year or two I was doing as good or better than before. (The only exception is that the full-time job calls dried up.)<p>The rule of thumb here is that multi-skilled contractors can always find work as long as they have good marketing and sales skills. The guys who had been camping out at the same job for several years and not growing their skillset had the worst time of it.",1419252706

It&#x27;s like I want Rust to be Haskell, but without the GC, and I feel like I&#x27;m dumb for not being able to make it work that way.

Static demand implies that either 1) the number of people using bitcoin to transact value has been relatively stable, or 2) the number of people in the ecosystem using bitcoin to transact value is growing but offset by churn/decreased usage by other participants.&quot;<p>Am I being slow here? The graph showed the number of daily transactions was increasing over 2014, yet the conclusion being reached is that the demand for usage of Bitcoin is static. Perhaps I&#x27;m reading it wrong, but from where I&#x27;m currently standing it doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>One thing that needs to be understood about Bitcoin usage is that the transactions are not always for whole Bitcoins, it&#x27;s increasingly common to see trades for fractions of a Bitcoin.

Every wall may intersect with some other wall at most once.

You don&#x27;t have to check wether places are still accessible -- they just always are and will be. Back in those days (qbasic on a 268) just drawing randomly from some point in random directions was about ten times faster than the common path walking (backtracking) style algorithms. Taking two seconds instead of a full minute.<p>Don&#x27;t take my word for it. Grab a pencil. Start drawing random lines. They may only cross some other line at most once. You&#x27;ll end up with a fully accessible maze.<p>The maze may be complicated -- the walls in a proper maze are not.

Complex questions have multiple sources that may be incomaptible in forming an answer to a question.

Keeping a network with 250 PHash/s running costs 219 million Dollars per year (1 GHash/J mining efficiency, 100 $/MWh energy costs) and probably quite a bit more if you account for other costs like hardware, rental or cooling. If your block reward is worth nothing you will have a problem keeping the network running. Scale back the hash rate and you get vulnerable. Increase the fees - with 100k transaction per day you are looking at costs of 6 Dollars per transaction for electricity only - and you damage one of the main selling points of Bitcoin, cheap transactions.

I worked at a web consultancy.<p>I saw decent developers laid off, but good developers kept on.  I saw companies desperately hunting for business (and signing ruinous contracts to have revenue).  I saw promises to employees that had been made in exuberance broken (we&#x27;ll open a London office).  I saw poor business practices--lay offs the week of Thanksgiving, for example.  I saw the business I was a part of get smaller and smaller as the fat was trimmed.<p>However, for good developers, there were still raises.  I know some great people who were hired away, so I think that the job market still existed.  But you certainly weren&#x27;t getting the exuberant benefits in the new job.<p>I was too young to be on recruiters&#x27; radar, so I can&#x27;t comment on that.<p>As far as insulating yourself, I think the best things you can do are:<p><pre><code>   * be humble
   * learn new skills
   * be cognizant of the business and the value it provides to consumers, and where it is weak
   * know if the business is profitable, and how (1 big customer? 1,000,000 small ones? advertising) 
   * save a large chunk of your salary, and not just in your 401k
   * keep your network alive (maybe be an informal recruiter? http://www.mooreds.com/wordpress/archives/1728 )

That&#x27;s the entire point of the author&#x27;s article.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that the majority of HN comments are about &quot;currency&quot; and &quot;medium of value&quot; in response to this particular article.  The author tried to talk about The Other Interesting Thing that seems to be flying under everyone&#x27;s radar:  the <i>authentication of information</i> by distributed digital consensus instead of a central institution.<p>That&#x27;s why the author tried to use the Linux analogy.  While many folks were measuring success via the meme/joke &quot;<i>2001, 2004, 2014, etc is the Year of the Linux Desktop!</i>&quot;, Linux has quietly &quot;won&quot; on the backend servers, on Android phones, on cable DVR boxes, in Raspberry Pi, etc.  The desktop as a health indicator of &quot;Linux success&quot; becomes irrelevant.<p>Linux:  ignore &quot;desktop war&quot; and substitute &quot;servers, internet-of-things, embedded devices&quot;<p>Bitcoin:  ignore &quot;currency vox populi&quot; and substitute &quot;decentralized trust of information.&quot;<p>To meta analyze why the discussion about Bitcoin&#x27;s &quot;other&quot; tech possibilities is always derailed by &quot;currency&quot; and &quot;fluctuations&quot;, I think it&#x27;s due to:<p>--The word &quot;<i>coin</i>&quot; embedded in the name &quot;bit<i>coin</i>&quot;<p>--5 years of breathless hype stories (on HN and elsewhere) around bitcoins rising<p>--Silk Road money laundering, etc<p>Since bitcoin is so tainted now with &quot;currency&quot;, we need a mental reset.  Here&#x27;s what the author is saying the world wants:<p>The time is ripe and the underlying technology exists (internet reach, cryptographic hashes, etc) for the adoption of a decentralized authentication of information platform.<p>Let&#x27;s think about it.  If we were to list the technical requirements for a &quot;decentralized authentication of information&quot; service, it would include things like cryptographic hashes, block chains, a transaction API, etc.  Basically, it would end up looking a lot like Bitcoin!<p>We could call the service GitHogAnyInfo (to riff on the names of decentralized source code Git Mercurial).  Or call it ConsensusInfo or whatever.  Just call it any name that does not have &quot;coin&quot;, &quot;doge&quot;, or &quot;money&quot; embedded in it.  If you do that, everyone&#x27;s brain shuts down and we get trapped in the discussion about &quot;currency fluctuations&quot;.<p>For example, look at these:<p><a href=""https://www.globalsign.com/en/timestamp-service/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.globalsign.com/en/timestamp-service/</a><p><a href=""https://www.digistamp.com/technical/how-a-digital-time-stamp-works/?q=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.digistamp.com/technical/how-a-digital-time-stamp...</a><p>Neither of those services have &quot;currency&quot; anywhere in their description.  Can a bitcoin-as-info-platform instead of bitcoin-as-currency compete with, or replace services like those?  That&#x27;s the thesis the author is trying to convey.  That&#x27;s the angle the SV investors are envisioning.",1419251564

Maybe the recipients were my colleagues, my family, my friends from university - the platform had very little idea. Now the content that we share is analysed in detail. The platform can be precise about the nature of the content, who it&#x27;s shared with (and who reads it and then re-shares it).<p>* Distributed to centralised - rather than millions of independent Wordpress, PHPBB and email servers, we now predominantly use a few platforms - Facebook, Twitter (plus a few smaller ones like Reddit, Hacker News).<p>For me, those are the biggest changes.

I have to assume that information inferred from data.<p>HFT is the easiest, it provides liquidity, helps to keep spreads narrow, flash crashes are nasty, but so rare there have been only 2 (and the cost of those was minimal, a few failed margin calls, oh noes).<p>Uber is tricky, because it&#x27;s run by assholes, but that&#x27;s not really different from the taxi (cab) industry in most cities. Plus they skirt the law, which was largely instituted to protect the interests of the incumbent taxi companies. It arguably helps to make the taxi market healthier, thanks to its increased efficiency, lower prices (larger supply), which leads to a bigger overall market, which likely leads to better relative wage for drivers. The potential negative externality happens when demand dries up, drivers are forced out of the market pretty fast, due to the more efficient pricing they must apply (or lose market share). And of course, Uber has competition Lyft (in the US) and Wundercar (in Europe) comes to mind.<p>And on traditional capitalism, the simple truth is that it&#x27;s inescapable. People are locally rational, they have limited information, and oftentimes they have utility function that are non-optimal even locally, but they are rational nonetheless, and again, people are price sensitive. So capitalism is just the machine of progress that seeks more efficient allocation of capital. And even if you do away with property ownership (and try to opt for a temporary property possession model) you&#x27;ll find that other types of capital still remain, they just get more perversely important (human capital, who knows who&#x27;s who, influence, reputation, use of force, and so on).<p>And you can see that for these inferences you need evidence, but these are not single instance based cases like the Sony hack. It&#x27;s much more sound and safe to trust and act upon these aggregates, than upon a single FBI &quot;post&quot; and the resulting drama.",1419250222

180344,comment,180317,180332,0,0,r7000,,,"I got the impression that the main point was that higher prices in various non-US countries has led to societies that are structured less around the availability of cheap gasoline: denser cities, a greater variety of transportation options and so forth. Thus paying more for gasoline isn't as big of a ""lifestyle"" hit whether it is ""absolute"" or ""relative"".",1209837484

180337,comment,179911,179911,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"I commented on the blogger's post that I don't think this is really accurate. It doesn't take into account smaller volumes of submissions in the middle of the night, i.e. it looks at the absolute number of items being made popular rather than the probability of any particular link being made popular. This is not entirely clear because the aiderss ranking algorithm is opaque, but I still think its the case.",1209836526

Microsoft eventually won: the masses, by definition, are far more numerous than the elite.</i><p>To say that Microsoft ""won"" is to be mired in zero-sum, winner-take-all thinking. If you can look at Apple Computer's earnings reports and see a company that has ""lost"", you're smoking something.<p>Microsoft is profitable, Apple is profitable. And the masses may outnumber the elite, but the elite has a lot more disposable income per capita.<p>There's no reason why both MySpace and FaceBook cannot ""win"" simultaneously.",1209836403
180334,comment,179590,179799,0,0,richardw,,,"Well, I was worried about leaping into it feet-first and the application was emerging and needed lots of massaging.  So I got a contracting gig that requires 1 or 2 days a week but lets me work full-time if I need to.  I choose when to work on what, depending on what needs it most.  Now that it's getting somewhere and I'm happier to take more risks, I'm spending some money on other people doing stuff for me.<p>What I love about it:\nFeedback.  Really nice feedback.\nMeeting people I'd never interact with in my day-job.\nNot throwing the code away when the project is finished.\nEach bug fixed is one that matters a lot to me.\nPayments while I sleep!\nLifehacker links that set the server on fire.  I didn't work for them - they just arrive.<p>I finally did it.  Who knows how it'll work out, but after a long time of killing myself for projects I got limited benefit from, I finally dragged an application from idea to release under my own steam and it's making money.  That's a great emotional boost!",1209836395

180332,comment,180317,180317,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"Sometimes I'm amazed by the innumeracy (or perhaps it's just being US-centric) of people who seem to be in positions of importance.<p>""Everybody pays more, but the U.S. pays more in absolute terms,"" said Lee Shipper, a visiting scholar at the University of California Berkeley's Transportation Center. If you're already paying $4 in taxes, said Schipper, then an extra $2 a gallon isn't that big of a deal.""<p>From some random cruising around wikipedia, there's an obvious flaw with that logic. Most fuel taxes around the world are sales taxes, and either based on a percent of the underlying price, or if they are an absolute price per gallon, they are adjusted periodically based on inflation.<p>So any price increase is going to be magnified by the increase in taxes - people in countries with higher taxes will see the same proportional increase, and a larger absolute increase.<p>In addition, in that quote above, he seems to have meant to say ""relative"" where he said ""absolute.""",1209835621
180331,comment,180299,180319,0,0,pg,,,"The biggest change to an answer is the question about the ""IQ test.""  The editing of the questions also changes the sense of some answers significantly.<p>E.g. in the answer to their version of the question about the ""IQ test,"" it seems like I'm snarkily concluding that except for one who got an acquisition offer during the interviews, none of the startups that turned us down succeeded.  In fact I only talked about this because they explicitly asked about it, I don't remember exactly how many there were, and I don't know for sure what happened to any of them.<p>In the last question it looks like I'm introducing pmarca's belief that markets matter most, when in fact I was parrying their introduction of it.",1209835550

180328,comment,180299,180299,0,0,wmorein,,,"""The ""IQ test"" quote refers not to how fast they have to decide, but the amount of equity we usually ask for. In the median case it's 6%. If we take 6%, we have to improve a startup's outcome by 6.4% for them to end up net ahead. That's a ridiculously low bar. So the IQ test is whether they grasp that.""<p>In starting to write a comment on this I did a little searching and found out that YC takes common stock rather than preferred (at least according to this: <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2007/04/16/y-combinator-continued/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2007/04/16/y-combinator-continued/</a>). It is interesting since the statement above is <i>only</i> true as long as common with no additional rights is given. I wonder what the terms of the ""copycats"" mentioned are -- does anyone know if they are asking for preferred or other rights for their equity?",1209835379

People are wary of the end of Moore's law, and look to parallel processing as the future.  The types of computations that GPUs do are embarrasingly parallel, and would make good parallel processors if they can be generalized.  It makes sense for NVIDIA to move in this direction.",1209835252

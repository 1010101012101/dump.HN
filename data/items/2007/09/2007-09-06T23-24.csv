51365,comment,51351,51351,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Note the date.  In 2000, Perl was, by far, the leading scripting language (and language for the web).  I'm certain that if this rant were written today, it would target PHP, and possibly even Ruby and Python.  Ironically, perhaps, modern Perl is more lisp-like than any other mainstream language (aside from JavaScript, in some ways), and so this article merely says, ""Mainstream languages that come pretty close to Lisp are brain-damaged and you'd have to be a particular breed of crazy to use it for anything.""",1189122728

I've seen pg prune hostile comments, but never challenging or negative ones (and I've made quite a few of both--I don't think I get a special pass because I have a YC funded company).  And I also strongly doubt challenging pg or anyone else here with a well-thought out argument would have a negative impact on applications for funding.  There are plenty of strong personalities in YC companies, many of whom are not particularly intimidated by pg--I strongly doubt the YC folks have a problem with that, at all.  Not being cowed by challenges from your investors and advisers is probably even a necessity for success, and pg has mentioned it in several talks and at least one essay.[1]<p>Of course, that doesn't invalidate your argument.  Maybe folks are hesitant to challenge folks for fear of hurting their chances with YC.  It's a mistake to hesitate for that reason.  But it's entirely possible that people do.<p>1: Search for the word ""adult"" in this essay: <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/notnot.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/notnot.html</a>",1189121937

Read it people, read it!<p>But I don't think there is any karma whoring going on. I think PG articles come with a pretty safe bet of being a good read. Whereas you aren't sure what you are going to get with the others. Im assuming pretty much everyone reads the PG essays, and thus there is more discussion to be had. Whereas I would like to know the proportion of people who read all the other links submitted, as opposed to just their titles.",1189120085

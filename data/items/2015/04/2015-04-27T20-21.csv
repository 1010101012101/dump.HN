For example, even though C was the first language I learned, I can&#x27;t imagine writing a parser in C after discovering the simplicity & readability of monadic parsing in Haskell. [1] Just compare that page with the parser/lexer for the Jq tool on the HN homepage (written in C).<p>A few months ago, I needed to retrieve JSON data from a list containing dozens of URLs. Fortunately, the &quot;async&quot; package handles this beautifully: [2]<p><pre><code>  pages <- mapConcurrently getURL [&quot;url1&quot;, &quot;url2&quot;, &quot;url3&quot;,...]
</code></pre>
Once you learn the basic concepts of Haskell and get over the hump, you’re able do things with ease that would otherwise take many years to master in C++ [3]. Even the most advanced features of the language follow the same underlying principles & syntax.<p>My advice to those wanting to learn Haskell is simply not to give up. Keep coming back to it. Practice. Read other’s code. Over time, things will begin to click. And once they do, you’ll wonder why you struggled so much in the first place.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.fpcomplete.com/school/starting-with-haskell/libraries-and-frameworks/text-manipulation/attoparsec"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fpcomplete.com/school/starting-with-haskell/libr...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://hackage.haskell.org/package/async-2.0.2/docs/Control-Concurrent-Async.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hackage.haskell.org/package/async-2.0.2/docs/Control...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000929/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000929/index.ht...</a>",1430167855

The end.<p>No amount of money thrown at a problem can absolutely, positively, 100% guarantee safety.  Even if you had a car that cost $1b it still wouldn&#x27;t be perfect.  It might have a perfect safety record but that&#x27;s because there would only be 500 drivers on the road worldwide and at that kind of a very, very sparse distribution cars might only pass one another a few times per day.  It might take years or decades for enough car-to-car interactions to take place to find the remaining weak spots in the billion dollar car to ensure that it didn&#x27;t accidentally kill someone.<p>But in the mean time you&#x27;d make millions if not billions of people poorer for not having the ability to drive cars which exist in the realm of affordability.  Nearly everything is always about time and material (and monetary) constraints.  If it wasn&#x27;t we&#x27;d all own skyscrapers and have private yachts and vacation all the time and etc, etc, etc.<p>> Ford and Toyota are companies that generates billions of dollars in profit.<p>And?  Ford has $53b of &quot;property, plant and equipment&quot; and on that $53b it made a profit of $5b in 2012, $7b in 2013 and $3b in 2014.  That averages out to $5b or a little under 10% annualized yield.

The second is that the pace of investment in the public sector, while very good, isn&#x27;t always able to complete with the private sector - especially when the size of the private sector is so much larger than public innovation. There&#x27;s also that the direction of technological change right now in SV is toward personal consumer products. Another reason is that more broadly the internet and cybersecurity has been a much larger problem for the US than it had anticipated. While the US has state of the art surveillance capabilities, built with its Five Eyes allies, it does not have the best cyberattack and defense teams (Russia is a notable leader). Obama characterized cyberwarfare as being more like basketball - everyone is scoring all the time and the one who scores the most wins. This is exacerbated by asymmetries. The US has the most to lose from cyberwarfare in terms of IP, wealth, and political secrets.<p>There is a new term being traded for what warfare is like today. Modern warfare exists simultaneously on multiple fronts, including the cyber domain and propaganda and information warfare. This term is hybrid warfare.<p>Finally, DARPA has new programming models it would like the private industry to adopt but no way to compel them to do so (Probabalistic Programming). This is a nice way for them to encourage the private industry to adopt and play with some of these new publicly developed technologies.<p>The last link I posted elsewhere in this conversation tree is the overview for the 2015 DoD cyberdefense planning. They are making investments on ALL fronts. Cybermilitary training, international partnerships, technology acquisition and investment, cyberwarfare simulation and modeling, diplomatic approaches, information sharing, etc. In other words, this is just one way that the DoD is &#x27;getting serious&#x27; about cyberwarfare.",1430166709

The B was in a 1000 level &quot;required&quot; course.<p>If I had questions on why I got homework or exam problems wrong (thus demonstrating that I didn&#x27;t understand the material) my engineering professors or TAs would generally explain the mistake I made.  It was really helpful to me and even though I couldn&#x27;t retake the exam and get the points back to get a better grade, at least I (usually) actually learned it the second time.  This also helped me figure out where I wasn&#x27;t learning effectively and to improve my ability to study, thus improving not only the value of my education in school but my ability to learn throughout the rest of my life.<p>After my first exam in my &quot;required&quot; class that one semester, I got a decent but not great grade.  On one of the questions I looked the answer up in the book.  It corresponded to what I put down on the test.

You can&#x27;t outsource responsibility for your life to someone else and then complain about it.  The prof is not responsible for what a student learns or enjoys any more than the prof is responsible for the students sex life or religious belief.  The student is responsible for learning the material.  If the prof refuses to answer questions or refuses to eval the students the prof is guilty.  If the students are lazy thats too bad for the student, sucks to be them.  If the students don&#x27;t like their prof, who cares, they&#x27;re just ignorant kids till they learn something useful...<p>Old people thinking is you learn for 4 years then work at the same company doing the same thing for 43 years and retire with the corporate gold watch.  Young people thinking is you learn full time for 4 years and then work while learning part time for 45+ years.  For 4 years you have profs who you think you can outsource your responsibility for learning to... and your plan for the following 45+ professor-less years, still have to learn with no one to outsource your responsibility for learning to?  Good luck with that.<p>There is also the missed effect of warped samples because the population is not constant over time.  Lazy students either sink or swim and possibly learn to avoid hard profs in the future.  Given that selection pressure its hard to imagine hard profs not resulting in better grades later because the sample is self selecting itself away from hard profs or dropping out.  Even if there is no difference in educational attainment between hard and soft profs.",1430166219

Feeling sorry for them is a natural and human thing.<p>- But, if everyone were begging all humans would starve to death. It&#x27;s not scalable.<p>- There are ~1 billion people on less than $1 a day (even with PPP adjustment that&#x27;s probably less than most beggars make).<p>- Begging is sort of a &#x27;squeaky wheel gets the grease&#x27; allocation method. It&#x27;s likely that there is someone else that would need the money more.<p>- It feels like a bad thing to incentivize.<p>- These people have harsh lives, and often they&#x27;ve started  with unfavorable odds. But I think it&#x27;s more useful to focus aid/effort on structural issues, like fighting corruption, improving world trade, good institutions, education, etc (in both developed and developing countries).<p>- Human civilization as it stands today is a product of long, hard struggle. Most people have lived grim lives.<p>- Mostly an anecdote, but I watched a movie called &#x27;Last Train Home&#x27;[3], about a Chinese family that works 12+ hours a day, 51 weeks per year. They saw their kids 1 week per year. That&#x27;s quite the struggle. I&#x27;d guess most people watching the movie would feel that these parents lived a harder life than many people begging in rich western cities.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing these are in any way optimal (or even good choices), but things I&#x27;ve donated to are Transparency International, Amnesty and Wikipedia.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.newsweek.com/half-swedes-want-ban-begging-319327"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newsweek.com/half-swedes-want-ban-begging-319327</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.newsweek.com/influx-roma-norway-leads-begging-ban-bill-304727"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newsweek.com/influx-roma-norway-leads-begging-ban...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Train_Home_(film)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Train_Home_(film)</a>",1430165796

I imagine a stuck pedal is likely to cause  confusion in a driver.  It would take some time before a driver will process what is happening, and realize that the accel pedal is indeed stuck.

And it&#x27;s not expensive.<p>But we&#x27;re seeing this fault in isolation.  The engineers are likely thinking, &quot;Suppose we fix this problem.  That&#x27;s fixed, and it cost $2 per car.  Now, what are the 1000 other items that could fail and cause a similar moment of confusion, of the kind that might contribute, or seem to contribute to an accident?

</code></pre>
Here&#x27;s the jq equivalent:<p><pre><code>    $ jq -r &#x27;.data.children[0].data.url&#x27; < foo.json

which looks an awful lot like every other tree parser I&#x27;ve used. Now suppose I want to get <i>all</i> the URLs with jq? That&#x27;s just:<p><pre><code>    $ jq -r &#x27;.data.children[].data.url&#x27; < foo.json
</code></pre>
In Jshon, I have to rewrite the query as:<p><pre><code>    $ jshon -e data -e children -a -e data -e url -u < foo.json
</code></pre>
That is, replacing the &quot;-e 0&quot; (get item at index 0) with &quot;-a&quot; (do the rest for all items). The jq equivalent changes &quot;.children[0]&quot; to &quot;.children[]&quot;, which to my poor muddled brain more clearly represents what I&#x27;m asking for. For me, jq&#x27;s query language maps well onto how I think about the problem. Jshon&#x27;s does not. That&#x27;s why I use one and not the other.<p>Again, I offer this sincerely.

The solution was hacked within days (hours? not sure), simply by grabbing plain-text IP adresses of all the users with a simple /status http query to the webserver of the service provider, and injecting them on random P2P networks using IPFuck (sic), de facto forcing all customers to break the law.<p>Orange retired their solution from the market and decided to never again try to take on that subject.<p>Right now the only official stance from HADOPI (3-strikes organization) is a recommandation to use WPA2 instead of WEP.

3274929,comment,3274591,3274810,1,0,nxn,,,"There are some books that go over using functional programming for ""real world"" tasks. Two off of the top of my head are Real-World Functional Programming by Tomas Petricek and Jon Skeet (.NET focused, and might be a bit aged now), and Real World Haskell (<a href=""http://book.realworldhaskell.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://book.realworldhaskell.org/</a>). So indeed, there are resources to help answer this question by walking you through common things like drawing graphs, database querying, working with XML, etc.<p>I've given F# a try recently for some of those tasks, and while it certainly is very capable of accomplishing them, I've found that using the .NET libraries, or having to expose my own APIs to C# developers in a way that will be natural to them, often leads me to simply writing C# with F#'s syntax. This is certainly no worse than having done so in C# directly, but the core ideas behind functional programming just seem to get diluted. On a side note, I think that with a bit of more design in mind, it should be possible to at least keep the core components 'functional' and then just have a middle layer that defines the classes and handles interop so your code can then be used from C# in an OO way.",1322156640

Of course, dictionaries are incredibly useful when called for (for instance, when you want to iterate over the keys!).<p>But I have frequently seen them being used when class instances would be better suited.<p>Dictionaries' values cannot be replaced with methods via @property, and as a result, I've found they often need to be replaced with objects at some point.  DStruct is a response to that problem where your access interfaces aren't forwards-compatible with the great majority of types you might choose in the future (ORM/ODM instances are a big one).<p>But I've also found it quite useful in the other direction:  when replacing what was once an ORM/ODM class with something mocked (e.g. the data source that was once a database has become a remote resource, local file, parser output, or configuration dict), having to run around changing attribute accessors to dict accessors is a drag at best, and impossible at worst (e.g. If you were using @property extensively to return computed attributes, or you know at hydration time that code elsewhere relies on a schema (I do both a times, as anyone writing large, maintainable applications should.).<p>As another commenter also mentioned, my approach does yield prettier code.<p>While it's not always sufficient cause, prettier code is in fact a <i>good</i> thing.",1322156232

And I'm talking about professional design firms!<p>I love HTML5 and I see no reason not to use it today. I know that there are still people using browsers that won't support the majority of features but we can still at least use the new tags and doctype with the JS shiv. For everything else there are well known ways to serve up new hotness to modern browsers and old lameness to old browsers. For example we can use the video tag with the last line before the closing tag being an embed for a YouTube or other video player as a fallback for older browsers.<p>I think there are 2 and a half reasons why HTML5 isn't being widely adopted yet. First, newbies are being fed old techniques from online tutorials and old books. Secondly, many of the cooler new features of html5 require JavaScript to work (Local Storage and Canvas for example). A lot of people still haven't gotten on the JavaScript bandwagon (including me, I admit. I can use jQuery plugins and get how they work but god help me if I had to write a single line of JS from scratch!). And then reason 2.5 is that people are just set in their ways. There are a ton of people who had been fed the rhetoric about semantics, divitis, and how to ""properly"" write HTML while learning XHTML and waiting for the I,agin any XHTML2 spec to arrive. Some of those people are set in their ways or have sour grapes about XHTML not being the new hotness after all the hype.<p>I have a question though. Why is it that in the HTML5 Boilerplate the doctype tag is in all lowercase? My text editor highlights it like its wrong. I usually capitalize the word DOCTYPE and leave html in all Lowe case.

I think Haskell already has such a library -- perhaps someone's ported it to F#?<p>- You can use F# 'async' workflows to retrieve data from web APIs really easily (and quickly, if you are doing it in bulk).

Emphasis will be on ease of use, since the majority of the other guys aren't as technical as I am.  It would be ideal to have a system that handles support ticketing and documentation at once;  linking to ""knowledge base"" articles from within a support ticket seems great, and building a KB article from a support ticket would also be good.  Perhaps something with a tag/category system, so that a staffer could just look at all past issues of a similar nature?<p>I started my biz as a one-man blog, so I didn't go in with any real plans for scalability.

We produce written content and data-focused analytics to people who make money by buying selling and trading cards.  The majority of our support tickets are billing-related, but we occasionally get reader feedback and writing submissions.

Good UI makes easy things that should be easy, and hard that which should be hard. (E.g.: <a href=""http://www.zen171398.zen.co.uk/Alien%20Page%206/Ian%20Wingrove-auto%20destruct02.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zen171398.zen.co.uk/Alien%20Page%206/Ian%20Wingro...</a>) Your mistake is naive optimization of one part of the process.<p>In this case, the right system would be one that makes it very easy for deletion review to process requests. It would also make sure that only well-formed, well-thought-out deletion requests make it to the deletion reviewers. The UI of that submission process could be made easy, but it's an essentially hard problem. You're supposed to think carefully, come to grips with the careful balance that Wikipedia has struck around deletion, and then submit a reasoned argument.<p>It's not possible that someone will do that in 1 minute of reading.

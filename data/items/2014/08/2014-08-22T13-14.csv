Say you want to make a t-shirt with a picture of Eiffel tower, with some catchy meme underneath, and sell it. You google/bing/whatnot for &quot;picture of Eiffel tower&quot;, download the best looking image and silk print a t-shirt. Now, in an unlikely event it catches up, and you start selling in millions, what&#x27;s going to happen? There&#x27;s a good chance that you&#x27;ll get a mail from someone who took that crappy picture and now demands a hefty sum in royalties. Well, just to avoid that, I take the picture.

Reading from disk, writing to the network, synchronizing, etc.&quot;<p>People just sort of chant this, yet... if you upgrade from Python to something on the faster end of the spectrum, like D, you are <i>very likely</i> to still experience significant speed up, in my experience, even if you don&#x27;t touch IO access patterns. You&#x27;re even more likely to see a real latency decrease. And that&#x27;s before we start actually multithreading or anything.<p>For all the work done on them in the past few years, the dynamic languages remain <i>slow, slow, slow</i>.<p>I think people often don&#x27;t look at the math very carefully... if you do, say, half a dozen DB queries each less than 1ms, but your entire web page is clocking in at 50 or 100ms of rendering, all numbers that are very easy to see in real life (such as my own personal Django blog, where I&#x27;ve carefully counted each DB access and carefully indexed all of them), you are <i>not</i> actually spending all your time in IO wait.<p>One of the worst cases for a dynamic language is crawling a large object hierarchy, obtaining lots of tiny objects from them, and then merging them together in the end. You pay and pay and pay for the constant new object creation, reference count management, endless resolutions of methods, and all the other things dynamic languages are doing over and over and over (even when JITed).<p>Now, guess what &quot;rendering a template&quot; looks like internally.<p>Oh, and don&#x27;t forget, if the DB returns in 1ms but your language reports the query took 5ms, you can&#x27;t count the time it took your dynamic language to handle what came back from the DB as IO wait!<p>(I have to admit, I&#x27;m <i>really</i> done with the dynamic languages. It was fun when the megahertz went up every year, but now it&#x27;s like wearing 20lb concrete shoes and trying to pretend that&#x27;s not a problem, it doesn&#x27;t affect my performance at all... and the 20lb is already after we cut it down from 40lb with all the JITs and stuff, which rhetoric notwithstanding simply <i>do not</i> produce anything like C-like performance in practice.)",1408715751

8212069,comment,8211639,8211639,3,0,ckaygusu,,,"This article is full of D hype and so so so far away from reality.<p>Alright, some basics;\nEverything that has to access persistent information frequently is bound by disk/network/whatever IO, and web programming is no different. The reason why languages such as Python and Ruby are very viable options for this task is they are quite a lot abstracted away from bare metal to hasten the development process. The wait for IO is quite long compared to logic execution, so even though we are executing more instructions to get the same job done, the resulting overhead isn&#x27;t very significant.<p>CPU-Bound computations are most definitely will execute faster in statically compiled languages such as C/C++, D, golang relative to interpreted languages but in the context of web programming this is not the case. Even though; if rendering HTML is such a big pain in the ass that it is slowing you down a lot you can always use a library that is implemented in a language that&#x27;s fast, say C, and use its wrappings in your scripting language of choice. I am not sure about to what extent this is supported in other languages but I know you can do this in Python, heck you can do this in golang, even though it is a relatively new language [1].

8212055,comment,8206038,8208054,1,0,mschaef,,,"A couple comments:<p>> I dislike this notion that Lisp (or Haskell or OCaml or ...) owe it to everyone else to explain and enunciate why it can be more productive to use Lisp.<p>There are a couple reasons why I think this happens.  The first is that people who use Lisp (or any other technology) will rightfully get excited about using it. Sometimes this translates into trying to evangelize it to other people, which is not a bad thing.<p>The second reason is that Lisp has a long history of 1) incubating major contributions to the field and 2) being continually marginalized by commercial practice. In many cases, this marginalization is warranted... there have been many good reasons not to use the language. In that kind of environment, it&#x27;s easy to see enthusiastic users of Lisp getting a little defensive and writing apologetics about their tooling.<p>> What the hell is an X-pression?<p>He describes it, in some detail, directly in his post.<p>> Opportunities to participate. ... Nothing to do with Lisp again.<p>I do think this is an area where Lisp has unique advantages. Good Lisp systems tend to have good online documentation, good access to the underlying source code, and good interactive facilities for modifying a system.<p>Just as an illustration, I tend to think that Emacs couldn&#x27;t really work as a closed source software package, and I don&#x27;t think it would be nearly as powerful as it is with a different language than Emacs Lisp.

Most words are written with the Kanji, which are very similar to Chinese Hanzi.  Japanese printers didn&#x27;t actually have a job that was any easier than Chinese printers.  I won&#x27;t say that have an ideogram writing system wasn&#x27;t a disadvantage, but it wasn&#x27;t a huge one and China&#x27;s vibrant literary scene shows that they could overcome it.<p>The emphasis of the Chinese exam system on the classics was also a problem, though having a bureaucracy selected by what was essentially an IQ test was a pretty huge advantage in general.  But intelligence is no guarantee of probity, and by the time of the opium war 25% of the Chinese GDP was being collected in taxes... but only a fifth of that was going into government coffers.  Top down control matched with an absence of credible external threats was a recipe for corruption.<p>In Japan, by contrast, you had the Shogunate which was suzerain over Japan but only sovereign over a relatively small portion of it.  The Tokugawas worked hard to prevent the Daimyos from taxing their peasants too hard (as a means of restricting their power), which resulted in a lot of commercial growth in the pre-Meiji period.  In the modern West we have methods of taxation that are generally[2] fairly efficient in terms of transferring wealth from the citizens to the state with not much loss, and the things that the money is spent on are fairly useful.  These things are far less true of taxation back in the 18th century.<p>And you could look at lots of other issues too.  Like the fact that the Qing dynasty was still viewed as a bunch of foreign barbarians by many meant that they had to be very traditional, and didn&#x27;t have enough legitimacy to spend on modernization.<p>[1] Katanana, the other syllabary, is used for non-Japanese sounds such as those made by the wind or Americans.<p>[2] Except the US&#x27;s corporate income tax.",1408714399

But I&#x27;ll add that without some notion of risk, the estimate is itself risky. In other words, when building a business plan around software estimates, getting a one number as an estimate (30 days) is a bit crazy. It would be much more useful to attach a range or confidence to the estimate<p>What happens now is that Project Manager asks Team Lead for an estimate. Team Lead pads the estimate a little and says 40 days. If Project Manager expects a 20% ROI, there&#x27;s a significant risk that the project will still end up in the red. Or the team ends up crunching like crazy to &quot;catch up&quot;, which is basically the same thing since your spending other things (quality, employee health and goodwill, etc.) instead of budget. Whatever the exposure, there is significant risk that is not clear in the business plan, which is a failure of management.<p>In contrast, maybe Team Lead could give a 50% chance that Project Jabberwocky will be done in 30 days and a 95% chance we&#x27;ll be done in 120 days.<p>Wait, Project Manager says, that&#x27;s a wide range of values to plan around! He&#x27;s right, but the emotional reaction is due to him being educated about risk, not due to the Team Lead dragging his feet or something.<p>So what is a Project Manager to do with that estimate? Take the risk into account.

So at 2GHz, that&#x27;s closer to 4 billion instructions per second, or ~800M instructions per request as per your calculation.<p>The slowness of their system can probably be blamed on slow database access, or some kind of initialization cost they&#x27;re paying for every request (i.e.: calling into a binary like in the old CGI days, initializing the Python VM every time).",1408712937

Current OS'es  already do manage memory in some ways, so they could as well do more work, so you don't have to re-invent that wheel every time you write a new compiler.  Having a full blown virtual machine as an OS actually sound very promising : you can for instance migrate from X86 to ARM transparently, re-compiling nothing but the kernel.  You can reduce hardware support for fancy features, simplifying it.<p>Now, a good enough compromise could be a layer of compatibility for a garbage collected language.  And we already have plenty of these.<p>> <i>The API are written for the _hardware_.</i><p>You got that backwards.  The API is written for <i>humans</i> to use the hardware.  If the hardware is complex and quirky, it's the job of the API to make it simple and straightforward.  It's nice and all to go low level, but at the end of the day you have to get things done.  You sound like you need every last drop of performance out of your CPU.  When you really do, then you may want to do your work in kernel space with no runtime check at all.  But most of the time, you don't.<p>To sum up, an OS written in C will most likely have a C-like API (I note that you didn't disagree with that).  There's still the high-level vs low-level debate, but it basically has the same structure as the GPL vs BSD debate.  I prefer high-level and GPL, on the grounds that they eventually <i>enable</i> more.  You seem to prefer low level (and BSD?), on the grounds that they <i>permit</i> more (which is not the same at all).  We could go on, but if we actually disagree on that point, I don't know how we could convince each other.",1287157772

A lot of company finance depts shuffle Excel files back and forth via e-mail and shares, and merging out-of-sync data becomes an issue. You would be surprised how many finance departments of large companies still do this in a Mickey Mouse fashion.<p>There are enterprise products that address this, like Cognos Planning, Hyperion (not sure of the specific product name), Cognos TM1, Jedox Palo. But they are expensive (5 figures and up) for licensing and expensive for customization (>150/h consultants). Not so expensive that you wouldn't get ROI from the wasted person-hours, but the sticker shock is there, and in the case of the Cognos products, the usability leaves a lot to be desired.<p>I'm not sure that Hypernumbers can match the functionality of the enterprise products I mention above (today at least), but for the modest to light use cases, it seems to be satisfactory.",1287157393

It is certainly possible to decompile an executable program into source code with equivalent behavior, but that code may not be easy to understand. Well-written source code contains a lot of information — such as variable names and comments — that is not strictly necessary for the program to work (and thus is typically thrown away by the compiler) but makes the code easier to understand. Understanding code written in an unfamiliar style is difficult enough, but understanding code with no variable names or comments is usually not worth the effort.",1287157293

At best they'll hear a few of the artist's tracks, if they're patient and lucky. Therefore the radio is in no way a substitute for owning the LP, it's more like an advert/complement than a competing service. But Spotify DOES let the potential customer access your product in full, removing the main incentive to buy your LP. Furthermore, you're not only competing with a free version of your <i>own</i> product, your competing with a vast catalog of other music, millions of records that can be accessed effortlessly. ""Should I spend £10 on this one album, or should I spend £10 for a month of unlimited access to endless high-quality music?""

If you quit and take time to work on your own stuff, you will learn a TON about your work habits, how productive you are, your focus levels and whether the entrepreneurship route is for you.

Maybe it's tough for you to understand that now, but I can definitely understand why some people would prefer this.<p>And, if you take time off, build some stuff on your own, and highlight that in your cover letter and resume, it will be very, very easy to find work should you wish to return.<p>Have fun!",1287156646

But why then did they get faster for so many decades?<p>As the process size drops, you can crank up the clock-speed while leaving the total heat dissipation constant.  But the heat density is related to the voltage, resistance, and the amount of time the transistors spend partially on or off (we wish they were perfect switches, but they aren't really).  So as you switch faster, unless you can lower the resistance or voltage (which requires changing your materials), you probably spend more and more time in a partially on or off state.  This means your heat density rises to the point where you are just south of burning things out.<p>You make some engineering decision about the reliability you want in your chips, and calculate or test how high a heat density you can tolerate.  But unless you change your materials so they use lower voltage, or invent new ways to move heat away faster, or use materials that are more conductive, you aren't upping the heat density or clock rate.  But you can still make them smaller and use less power total for the same amount of computation.<p>This is why reversible computing (gives off less heat), diamond substrates (much higher thermal conductivity), microfluidic channels (moves heat away faster), and parallelism (larger chips = more computation) are being explored.

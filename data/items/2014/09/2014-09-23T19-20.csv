Because Flash Memory can only be erased a finite number of times[1], SSD manufacturers specify the drive&#x27;s endurance -- defined as the number of bytes which can be written to the SSD over its lifetime.<p>The SSDs helpfully keep track of how many bytes you&#x27;ve written and report that in the SMART info. For example, on my Windows dev system, HDD Guardian reports that I&#x27;ve used up 42% of my SSDs endurance (it&#x27;s a Crucial m4 512GB). So by &quot;usage&quot;, I mean the percentage of the endurance which has been burned.<p>[1] Each block of flash memory must be erased before it can be written. Each time you erase it, it &quot;uses it up&quot; a bit and will be harder to erase next time. So each time, the SSD controller is forced to erase it with just a bit more voltage. As the blocks become harder to erase, it takes more time to erase them and the SSD write bandwidth decreases.",1411502393

8357760,comment,8354278,8357166,4,0,kasey_junk,,,"Let me first clarify, there very well may be certain HFT that try to do this, but it isn&#x27;t a large class, because the sophistication and speed required would mean that you could market make more profitably in most instances.<p>The short answer to your question, is that other HFT prevent them from doing this.  It is very rare for a single HFT entity to represent the entire order level at a price.  Therefore just because they can react to their own transactions (the only ones that aren&#x27;t on a public feed) faster doesn&#x27;t mean they can react to everyone else.  Further, just because demand on one exchange implies demand on others, it doesn&#x27;t require it. So in the case where you read the demand wrong, and you are just changing your price you lose priority at the old price point and therefore there is an opportunity cost, but if you are actually making a transaction you lose both priority and the bid/ask spread which is a real cash cost.<p>Finally, we need to be very careful about the term frontrunning.  It is a specific thing.  Acting on the same information available to a counterparty faster than them is never frontrunning.  The only time it is frontrunning is if you have a fiduciary duty to be acting on a parties behalf and you don&#x27;t live up to that duty by trading ahead of orders they placed with you.",1411502262

In the same sense as most investors with basic sophistication would avoid mutual funds with management fees today, the large-spread stock markets of the 20th century basically imposed a similar fee structure on everyone <i>just to be in the market at all</i>.

In medium-sized project you&#x27;ll write DAO layer to convert DBMS view on data to application code view on data anyway for various purposes.

8357714,comment,8355772,8357094,6,0,anigbrowl,,,"Agree in principle, but the fact is that most American content is subsidized in one way or another, and most other countries also subsidize film and TV production. From an economic view I don&#x27;t like subsidies, but as someone who works in indie film I&#x27;m not going to be purist about it if one helps me get paid, it&#x27;s difficult enough to fund and sell film as it is.<p>Cultural material is not a simple commodity that you can apply laws of supply and demand to, because cultural products are not economic substitutes for each other. This is one of the few areas where I think some protectionism may be justified, because if you import all your media then it tends to crowd out one&#x27;s domestic culture, which in extreme cases can lead to social fragmentation. If you don&#x27;t have any kind of domestic media output then that also limits your country&#x27;s potential for tourism and inward investment.<p>I grew up in Ireland and although I was very interested in film from an early age there was very little domestic film or TV production going on; maybe 30-40% of what was on TV came from the UK and >50% came from the US (cheap for programmers to purchase given the tiny size of the market, and for political reasons we did not wish to get too much of our programming from the UK). There was only one TV channel for many years and it was quite demoralizing to realize that how little cultural output of our own there was. Apart from a documentary shot in 1934 by an Irish-American filmmaker, there wasn&#x27;t a single Irish-produced feature film for nearly <i>50 years</i>, until 1982 (when I was 12), and even that involved an English director. The domestic industry didn&#x27;t really get going until the early 1990s.<p>As a kid, I would borrow library books and read magazine articles about film production but even the notion of &#x27;home movies&#x27; seemed impossibly remote - I literally never saw a video or film camera until I moved to London. It didn&#x27;t occur to me to pursue a career in film as a youth because the domestic industry simply didn&#x27;t exist. Even with cheap digital technology available today, making a film is quite an expensive undertaking - there&#x27;s no guarantee that filmmakers will simply bootstrap themselves as the inevitable result of market forces.",1411501692

Is it a starter platform?<p>Python is a programming language, that is used to do lots of things - it is used in production at Google, and you can do pretty much anything with it, from data analysis/machine learning to web development, from game development to shell scripting. It is also quite easy to pick up, so it&#x27;s a good choice for beginners - although lots of experienced programmers use Python. That&#x27;s why I recommended you python.<p>Since you want to help for your startup, I&#x27;d recommend to try to pick up whatever they are already using, since there are probably programmers with some experience working with you.<p>EDIT: by the way, my email is in my profile, so feel free to contact me if you need something, and I&#x27;ll see what I can do.",1411500958

This means that sometimes syntax can be a little non-uniform, but there&#x27;s always a reason. Unlike C and C++, it doesn&#x27;t trade safety for speed of execution. There are no buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Go applications. It treads a fine line of where to let the language do the lifting and where to make you do it.  In general, it does a really good job of finding the pragmatic side of the line to sit on in any particular situation.<p>I don&#x27;t know of any widely used C garbage collection libraries. The benefit of it being a language-level is that <i>everyone</i> uses it, which means your code works the same as everyone else&#x27;s, so you can easily just reuse other people&#x27;s code, without having to restrict your search to some small subset of repos that use your particular GC Library.<p>Also, in Go, unlike most other garbage-collected languages, there is a stack, and you can pretty easily write code that only uses memory from the stack, and never needs to run GC.<p>Finally, Go&#x27;s tooling is really phenomenal.  Testing, doc generation, performance reporting, code coverage, linting, package distribution, code formatting, refactoring, cross-platform compiling, and soon, pre-processing, are all built-in and really well done.",1411500946

I&#x27;ve long wondered what made Acme special, and never had the patience to read through Pike&#x27;s paper.<p>TL;DW (my notes as I&#x27;m watching it for people who prefer text): Acme includes its own tiling window management for your open files/buffers. It is strongly mouse driven, where clicking or highlighting regions with the different buttons perform different actions. For example: highlight text with button 1, then with that held down clicking button 2 cuts that text. This mouse button combination/sequence is a &quot;chord&quot;.<p>More powerful is the &quot;execute&quot; action (button 2) on various text. executing the word &quot;cut&quot; does that. You can execute external programs this way, with the output appearing in a new buffer. You can of course pipe or redirect selected text to/from external programs. You can add frequently used commands to the &quot;menu bar&quot; (&quot;tag&quot;) by typing them there.<p>With the &quot;load&quot; action (button 3), you can load files by name and added references (such as open file at given regexp point and highlight to another point). This allows easy and native opening of filenames given by compiler errors.<p>Acme supports UTF-8 Unicode natively (aside: UTF-8 was invented for Plan9 where Acme comes from [1]).<p>Acme is an IDE that integrates external tools at the text level. As a Plan9 product, it exposes itself to other tools as a file system (using FUSE on Linux). Using this, the author created a simple presentation system used to demonstrate this very video.<p>An external script can read window events by reading a file in the file-system exposed by Acme. This can be used to implement a shell within Acme, or various things like mail readers, music players...<p>The button 3 (load) action can be used to easily open manpages and open related manpages by just highlighting &quot;acme(1)&quot;, or directly view a given Mercurial commit by loading its hash, or even a UPS shipment by loading its tracking number. Things can be opened in external programs, and all of this is managed by a &quot;plumber&quot; program that has rules.<p>As a programming environment, you can run some &#x27;watch&#x27; program on a work-in-progress buffer to (say) compile and run a program as you save.<p>TL;DR: Acme is a flexible editor that can perform programmable actions based on highlighted text and merge that into buffers, and exposes a filesystem-like interface for other programs to use.<p>PS: holy shit, I only just noticed that presentation was by Russ Cox.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/utf-8-history.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/utf-8-history.txt</a>",1411500504

8357482,comment,8354278,8355877,1,0,exelius,,,"HFT doesn&#x27;t move markets; it simply takes advantage of the lag between information becoming available and the market&#x27;s response. By doing this, HFT makes the market respond to information faster.<p>This is how arbitrage works. If there is an inefficiency in the market (e.g. the speed with which the market reacts to information), someone can take advantage of it. By taking advantage of it, the inefficiency disappears. Eventually, the arbitrage becomes commoditized and the &quot;value&quot; of the arbitrage situation is a few points above the cost of the solution.<p>You can&#x27;t apply morality to financial markets. All investments carry risk, and its up to each individual investor to choose securities in line with their personal risk tolerance. If the investor doesn&#x27;t understand the risks involved in a security, they shouldn&#x27;t be making investment decisions, full stop. If you&#x27;re like the majority of US retail investors, you&#x27;re buying a stock and holding it for a long time. HFT doesn&#x27;t really affect you in that case, because they play both short and long positions alternated many times throughout the day, yet averaged over a period of time it&#x27;s a zero sum game.<p>A good analogy to think of are Riemann sums vs. integrals in calculus. The actual movement of the market is the curve, but you don&#x27;t know the formula of the curve and you need to measure the area under it. So you approximate the curve by sampling a number of points (the current price of the stock at any given moment) and calculating the distance from the axis. HFT effectively allows you to sample more points, getting a more accurate result by removing &quot;arbitrage&quot; (or space between the sampled points and the actual curve).",1411499447

This is the case even if the expected benefit of a biopsy is negative due to the low likelihood of malignancy and the side-effects of a biopsy.<p>Fundamentally, medicine needs to change. In principle, doctors should choose their course of action based on the expected outcome, incorporating all available information. In many cases this action will be to do nothing. As more information is gathered by the medical community as a whole about, for example, the causitive relation between certain genes and diseases, the underlying models dictating the appropriate action can be updated.

Moving a tooltip or changing text, or supporting localization should not be risky, imo, but I have to fight for building out things like that.<p>It&#x27;s &quot;be prepare now&quot; vs &quot;fix it later&quot;. &quot;Preventative&quot; vs. &quot;reactionary&quot;",1411498931

In places like Canada, my impression is that even the stewards who dole out govt funding have forgotten what true research means. They dole out money for commercializing innovation, which is not research by definition. From what I&#x27;ve heard from other scientists, the US is doing a better job. They are focusing their research dollars on &#x27;promising&#x27; areas. This isn&#x27;t as bluesky but at least it is research.",1411498870

I have heard of everything from using consulting frameworks (e.g., 4 Ps) to the Fabulous 14. <p>The problem is that I've been in few meetings where an entrepreneur has been able to run through their presentation from start to finish.\n",1187620825
44304,comment,43426,43426,0,0,david927,,,"I've always read and enjoyed Steve's posts, but here he comes off smug (despite the self-depricating jokes) as if he's summoning enlightment for the audience, when the talk is simply obtuse.  Is a trademark necessary?  Hardly.  You can call something 'free' and yet try to charge for it.  No one needs to trademark the word 'free' to protect it.  In the same way, if some companies are using the 'open source' moniker without releasing their source, it will become quickly evident to the customer.<p>Could there be a certification based on a set of standards?  Sure.  What that would look like is a great topic.  But simply a lecture on basic marketing concepts is embarrassing and I think when Steve looks back on this video, it will be with a wince.  (In his defence, I'm glad no one has had a camera around during any one of my numerous embarrassments.",1187620428

From a listener standpoint, the fun is in exploring other people's music.<p>There really are two user roles at Anywhere.fm, the ""inner DJ"" and the ""music consumer"".  The 1.4 million songs shows that they've been successful at making the ""share your music"" process easy.  The more important statistic is how many people actually listen to any of the stations.",1187619485

That said, I think Nielson is discounting to some degree the effect of good typography/page layout in this discussion. <p>Pages that are designed well will focus the attention of the audience on the content being delivered. Note that the users also aren't looking at other things that seem to be accessory, like the navigation panes. In the end, though, that's just another argument to try to blend ads into the content area of the site, ethical or not.",1187619166

So I don't think we should avoid topics simply because people have said a lot of stupid things about them in the past. ",1187618872

10373265,comment,10372571,10372571,0,0,tracker1,,,"I think that is because most of the actual jobs are for programming, software development and systems/network administration.  The CS degree programs are more centered on math and some electrical engineering concepts. I think the problem is partly in terms of perception and partly in regards to expectations.  There simply aren&#x27;t that many jobs out there for entry level (fresh out of college) computer science types.<p>My suggestion would be for those who want to work in a given field to consider their internships carefully, and work on projects and in positions that lend themselves towards learning their desired field of employment over the specifics of the educational learning.  The CS concepts can help, but actual experience tends to count for more.<p>This is as an outsider who&#x27;s worked in software development for almost two decades now without a formal education.  I&#x27;ve worked with programmers with degrees that were very good at their job, and others with masters in CS that couldn&#x27;t think their way out of a wet paper bag.  Theory does not equate to practice, and software in particular is much more of a craft in practice than engineering or science.",1444639427

(Head first books, then team treehouse)<p>Once you have experience with basic web applications in vanilla PHP and MySQL give Rails or Laravel a try.<p>It&#x27;s tough to jump to a framework without learning to do some basic web applications in PHP/MySQL so you have a better idea of some of the magic a framework takes care of for you.<p>Check out laracasts.com and railscasts.com<p>Setup a server from scratch on digital ocean, just so you have that experience.<p>If you use Laravel there is a great deployment tool, Laravel forge, that configures the server and deploys your app for Rails you can use Heroku for easy hosting.<p>There are Laravel jobs out there, but Rails jobs are more plentiful and probably have a higher salary ceiling. See what you like and what you enjoy using.<p>Once you are using Laravel or Rails get some experience with React, Vuejs or angular2.<p>Once you have the basics you could look at a bootcamp that has a high success rate at landing graduates jobs.<p>As you&#x27;re learning setup your own websites, then when you get in to PHP MySQL setup some of your own web apps.<p>You&#x27;ll learn most when you&#x27;re trying to do something on your own. Creating an app that tracks something you collect, tracking your budget, a messaging app for you and your friends, or a private facebook for you and your family.<p>when you&#x27;re learning look for stackoverflow in your search results if you haven&#x27;t discovered it already.<p>Setup a github account, you don&#x27;t need to use it initially, but you&#x27;ll want to build your account to include your best work along with a portfolio.<p>bitbucket is nice for free private repos.<p>Use <a href=""http://getbootstrap.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getbootstrap.com/</a> for your own projects.<p>Once you learn the basics you could build websites for local businesses on nights and weekends, and build up clients/more and more complex projects/clients.

10373250,comment,10370132,10370132,0,0,EdSharkey,,,"I had a run-in with a woman on my team.  We disagreed on the design for a module she had just implemented.  It wasn&#x27;t going to meet the requirements, I argued.  She disagreed - it&#x27;d be fine.  Many times we sat in front of her code, I took her through exactly how her design was failing.  You know that extra 250msec mental processing time where you see it click in their heads when they realize they were wrong or had a faulty assumption?  There were like 3 of those times sitting with her, and she always changed the subject or insulted me for not understanding what she was trying to do - end of discussion.  Other team members backed me up from time to time when the issues I was raising were serious enough, I wasn&#x27;t completely alone.  There were other communications breakdowns, she NEVER requested anyone to pair with her, never did any design work nor discussed with the team what she was going to develop that sprint, was frustrated and defensive when her PR&#x27;s were full of criticisms (primarily from me.)<p>I was vocal, I was dissatisfied with her performance and did not keep it a secret, and I was demanding the same level of excellence from her as from anyone else on the team.  This went on for about two weeks ... and then she cried to the boss.  Told him she thought she might have to quit the company over the altercations with me.  So, they gave me the official sit down reprimand.  There was no interest hearing in my side of the story, not that it would matter the way HR is structured.  And, I got the distinct feeling they started keeping a file on me to try and get me canned.<p>My reaction to this, so as to keep my sweet job and food on the table, was to be just one more go-with-the-flow, smiley-faced, that-all-sounds-good kind of guy.  No more confrontation trying to get the best out of people.  Life is really nice now, I don&#x27;t have to care.  My work is still good, but I&#x27;m just doing as I was told and cashing my paycheck now.  Any actual love and passion for the work now goes into my hobby projects, and I don&#x27;t work late anymore.  Soon after all this blew over, the bosses remarked cynically that I was working so well with this woman, like it was surprising that I could turn off combat mode so easily/at all!  I just smile and laugh meekly, &quot;yeah, we&#x27;re working well together.  It&#x27;s all so great&quot; as I choke back the bile.<p>God help that woman if she ever needs help and I&#x27;m the only one to give it.  I&#x27;ve had to endure team dynamics 10x worse in my career than what she experienced with me and I didn&#x27;t rat out the other guy.  I cannot countenance such disloyalty.  The team must resolve its differences internally and not go informing on each other at the drop of a hat!<p>Anyhow, we are still on the same team, (thanks management!), and I casually try to avoid pairing with her most of the time and smile with gritted teeth when we do have to work together.  When I see her make a mistake, I don&#x27;t point it out and just laugh to myself about it.<p>I will outlast her but she has definitely put a damper on my moving into a lead role unless I switch departments.",1444639150

He dedicated a large amount of time to having me come in during office hours so I could do a mock lecture before it was actually delivered, and I could compare notes when he delivered his. Yes, he was exacting and demanding, but it made me a better student.<p>The fact that a lecturer with low standards happens to be popular with students is irrelevant. The math department has a large presence on campus because it is the best in the world. My advisor was Robin Hartshorne, and I took advantage of courses with a Fields medalist. That sort of department has standards that it enforces because it demands quality, not coddling.<p>This is all underlined by the fact that the lecturer in question states he has a breakdown of some sort due to the stress of the position. We&#x27;re to take this seriously? I feel for the man, but it clearly indicates that the criticisms might be divorced from reality.<p>If you&#x27;re too weak to excel in an environment filled with the world&#x27;s top researchers, and where you are responsible for your own achievement, then find another school where they let prop comics teach math and spoon feed you.",1444639022

The engine power inflation didn&#x27;t even stop (on the contrary, it continued) so now we drive super-efficient and super powerful small engines. 200hp, 300Nm and 5L/100km would seem like sorcery 15 years ago. Now it&#x27;s par for the course.<p>This would seem like a massive success for environmental regulation, and then the VW scandal broke. To me it just seems that the regulation wasn&#x27;t good enough: all it would have taken was to have strict regulations for <i>all</i> emissions (Particles, CO2, NOx, ...) and realistic test cycles.<p>At this point we should probably just tighten the regulations: set the bar at 100g/CO2 and also tighten the other emissions values to whatever a modern 1.4Litre petrol engine emits today. Then tighten the regulations every year. If manufacturers can squeeze diesels down to those levels, great!

It&#x27;s interesting to reading the internal grapplings of a man who was, to his countrymen, basically a walking god.<p>- Lucius Annaeus Seneca&#x27;s <i>Letters from a Stoic</i><p>- Epictetus&#x27; <i>Enchiridion</i>, which translates roughly as &quot;handbook&quot; and was assembled from the teachings of Epictetus, an exiled former slave, to those who traveled to live and study with him.<p>I strongly recommend all three. If you&#x27;re interested in more modern interpretations of the above, a couple good jumping off points would be <i>A Guide to the Good Life</i> by William Irvine (which was mostly pretty good) or <i>The Inner Citadel</i> by Pierre Hadot (which studies Meditations).

Specifically, when rendering a pixel in the image, the location of that pixel in the complex plane is passed to your function, which produces a complex value. That transformed value specifies a location in the original image. This procedure is fast, but plots the inverse of the function given. So, if you want to plot e.g. log(z), then you should instead put in e^z.&quot;",1444637540

I&#x27;m not sure what phenomenon that phrase should be applied to, but it certainly shouldn&#x27;t be applied to the phenomenon of people taking more risks because they won&#x27;t have to deal with the fallout.

I live with my girlfriend and she has a modest car that she&#x27;s paid off.  We both work downtown and live about 3 miles from work.  We mostly ride to work together so we only pay for one parking pass and use one car&#x27;s worth of fuel.<p>When weather is nice I may ride my bike to work or ride the motorcycle I bought for shorter trips that don&#x27;t require the car or highway driving.  Either way, the bike cost maybe a third of what her car cost but neither of us is paying off a vehicle loan.<p>I&#x27;ve considered getting a second car.  Something used and under $10k.  Maybe even under $8k.  Basically I think about it those handful of times it&#x27;s not convenient to share the car and I need to pay $10 to take a cab/Uber or rent something once a year for a longer trip while she needs the car.<p>But I can never really justify it.  As much as I&#x27;d like my own car, even a perfect balance (cheap/old enough to be affordable but no to much that maintenance makes up the difference) would cost way more than hiring or renting something for the times I&#x27;d use it.",1454889485

11055636,comment,11054647,11055206,0,0,Zakiazigazi,,,"In my experience Japanese site are way more cluttered than Chinese sites. Even with the large number of links and pictures Chinese sites look more organized and designed where Japanese sites are just a plain mess. My theory is that Japanese writing relies on the comparatively simple hiragana for &quot;grammar&quot; (not to go too deep into the topic) in addition to the complex chinese characters. As such it gives the text a kind of weird rhythm without which it is pretty difficult for them to read text (only presenting hiragana loses the meaning while only presenting kanji would be very hard to skim) As a result even when somewhat deliberately designed, the end result seems like a jumbled mess of characters with varying contrast randomly flowing together. Additionally words that would for example  appear in a menu are of either writing system and as a result of varying length, thus difficult to align.<p>Combine this with the sofware industry here being absolutely driven by incompetence (&quot;as long as you shut up and work hard [= long hours] you are a good employee&quot;) in most places you get no willingness to risk changing the status quo that is stuck in the late 90&#x27;s.<p>Compared to that Chinese sites look pretty refined to me, with the same sort of characters of usually very similar length and while there is no whitespace the contrast between characters is much less varied and looks much more pleasant in my opinion. I can see contemporary patterns are also used a lot more too which suggest China in general is more aware of and willing to incorporate the latest trends. Taobao vs Rakuten might be a good example. Yahoo US vs CN vs JP (the latter run completely by Yahoo Japan and has nothing to do with actual Yahoo anymore) is another.",1454889351

11055633,comment,11054754,11054991,0,0,abalashov,,,"As a native Eastern European (who has been in the US most of his life), I&#x27;m still occasionally flabbergasted at the paucity of 3+ bedroom apartment options in US cities, as well as how crappy the <= 2 BR options are. It seems there&#x27;s a cultural expectation that once there&#x27;s more than two of you, you move out to the suburbs and buy a freestanding house. Like you, I have absolutely zero intention of following that script.<p>Central/Eastern European apartments often had a small foyer, a narrow hall way, and doors along the perimeter into ~2-3 rooms--sometimes more. The hallway usually had closet space. One room was generally somewhat bigger than the others and understood to be a &quot;living room&quot;. Kitchens were separate rooms and often had a door of their own, which effectively meant they were an additional room, since one could work, study and socialise at the kitchen table. Overall, there was much more compartmentalisation and walls, which I think is essential if you have children, but even if you don&#x27;t. Interestingly, I wouldn&#x27;t say their area was much bigger than 1-2 BR apartments typically found in America--the floor plan was just configured much more rationally.  Such apartments were fairly close to table stakes in former socialist bloc countries, as well as elsewhere in central Europe.<p>For instance, my wife and I live with our three young children in a 2 BR ~1200 sq ft. unit in downtown Atlanta--definitely against the grain. It&#x27;s the typical American apartment layout, a poor and awkward imitation of a house; front door that opens into an &quot;open plan&quot; consolidated living room and kitchen environment, and two bedrooms where &quot;private life&quot; is said to take place.<p>What would make far more sense to me would be to take that same 1200 sq ft. and dump the second bathroom and the unnecessarily large walk-in closet in the master bedroom. That would certainly provide for a third--if small--room that could be used as a study, which would literally make all the difference for allowing me to get at least some work done at home. And we don&#x27;t need a giant &quot;TV room&quot;; what we need are walls, noooks and crannies. It&#x27;s wasteful and pointless; it leaves us with two bedrooms that are really only good for sleeping, and one common area in which all five of us have to coexist much of the time. Might as well just get a large studio at that point.<p>As I see it, much of the problem with &quot;open plan&quot; offices carries over into &quot;open plan&quot; floor plans. I don&#x27;t understand Americans&#x27; obsession with and preference for this design. It&#x27;s perfectly possible for families to live comfortably in a central urban place with relatively little square footage--if it were designed more sensibly and with some of the virtues that otherwise can be found only in a freestanding house.",1454889335

Since this technology doesn&#x27;t really exist yet and nearly everything about it is pure prediction.<p>Your &quot;of course&quot; isn&#x27;t really true, is it? I mean, rental cars don&#x27;t come with a toolbox or first aid kit. To be fair, the toolbox was because I had a crappy car and needed to be able to fix it. A car rental service would include maintenance, but that extra work, and cycling out the cars more often, would probably be more expensive than having my own car, no?<p>(BTW, the &quot;spare tire&quot; was in the #1 category, under &quot;people will lease their cars to other while they don&#x27;t need them&quot;, not the #2 category of &quot;people will lease cars&quot;.)<p>I feel like you handwaved the &#x27;there would be a solution available&#x27; by considering and dismissing only one point, and not seeing it as an example of a larger set of problems.<p>Where is the ski rack?

Fog lamps? &quot;Baby on Board&quot; decals? Wheelchair lifts, lowered floor, or scooter hoist for those with handicaps? Phone or laptop charger?<p>Skiing friends of mine would leave their gear (boots, skis, packs, masks, gloves, poles, etc. plus duct tape and tools to fix minor problems) in the back of their SUV so they could take off for the mountains during snow season. It&#x27;s a hassle to lug all that equipment in and out for each trip, and you might easily forget something. My mother leaves a sewing machine (one of five) and other sewing gear in her trunk to make it easier to go to quilting events.<p>> You would have winter tires<p>Perhaps. It&#x27;s hard to say. I lived in Santa Fe, and in the city didn&#x27;t need snow tires. My friends lived in the country, at higher elevation, on the end of a long dirt driveway. New Mexico has a lot of dirt roads, so it&#x27;s best to be prepared. Even if the cars in Santa Fe had their tires swapped out, what about the cars of day-trippers from Albuquerque? Or those in Sacramento who decide to go to Tahoe?<p>As I only needed the sand once, it seems like an expense to swap out the tires each year for something that isn&#x27;t essential.

In &quot;Capitalism and Freedom&quot; Milton Friedman captured this as:<p>> [Antidiscrimination] legislation involves the acceptance of a principle that proponents would find abhorrent in almost every other application. If it is appropriate for the state to say that individuals may not discriminate in employment because of color or race or religion, then it is equally appropriate for the state, provided a majority can be found to vote that way, to say that individuals must discriminate in employment on the basis of color, race or religion. The Hitler Nuremberg laws and the law in the Southern states imposing special disabilities upon Negroes are both\nexamples of laws similar in principle to [antidiscrimination legislation]<p>This is in contrast with a focus upon either consequence or virtues. Deontological theory falls down on some observed economic scenarios.  For example, banker bonuses are generally deontological in nature, and as a result paid out quarterly regardless of performance; a consequentialist or &quot;virtuist&quot; might formulate banker bonuses on practical timelines or overall long-term results, in contrast.<p>In any case, what I thought was a reasonably balanced emperical study by John Donohue is worth reading [The Law and Economics of Antidiscrimination\nLaw] <<a href=""http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1033&context=lepp_papers>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?artic...</a> (it is the paper from which I drew Milton&#x27;s quote).",1454887976

Having done so, the device can then effectively MITM the organisation&#x27;s own traffic.<p>This can be quite effective if you have control of the client machines on your network and can reliably configure them to trust your choice of authorities. For example, this might be true in a university computer lab or in a corporate office where IT staff administer all the machines and staff don&#x27;t have admin rights to change anything. Now your anti-malware scanners and the like can operate on things like HTTPS traffic in the same way they would on any other connection.<p>It doesn&#x27;t work if you have other machines that don&#x27;t have the extra authority installed and therefore don&#x27;t trust the intermediary. Typically, either you&#x27;ll just see the same security warnings as you would for any other MITM threat, or they&#x27;ll block the traffic and you won&#x27;t be able to connect at all over an unauthorised encrypted link. Either way, all they see will be your encrypted traffic. Clearly it would be rather unfortunate for the entire global security infrastructure if this were not the case...<p>I note in passing that, other things being equal, this kind of technology is a good thing for security. There are more powerful tools available than the kind of antivirus software typically installed on individual workstations, and they are no more necessarily recording HTTPS traffic than any other traffic that they scan. But of course you&#x27;re still MITMing someone else&#x27;s traffic, and the person sending that traffic has only your word for it that you&#x27;re not configuring tools to record the &quot;temporarily&quot; decrypted data stream or otherwise process the data in unexpected ways.<p>There have already been lawsuits about this kind of comprehensive monitoring of network traffic in the workplace. Obviously it can look bad if for example an employee was using what they believed to be an encrypted connection to their bank to check that some legitimately employment-related payment has been received, but because it was from a work computer and intercepted that connection wasn&#x27;t actually secure. The results haven&#x27;t been completely one-sided so far; it&#x27;s a complicated issue, and there are elements of both an employer reasonably wanting to know what is happening with their own IT systems and the reasonable expectations of privacy of an employee to balance.",1454886894

Whilst an experienced developer should be able to understand a programming language/framework, being willing to work with its idioms or recommended best practices can be difficult for some.<p>As an extreme example, if someone is well versed in procedural programming, and we work in an OO heavy environment, then my concern is about whether the candidate can understand the reasoning for our abstractions and contribute to our OO modelling conversations. The same could be said of an experienced OO practitioner being asked to code in a functional manner.<p>I think a good rebuttal, although I haven&#x27;t had candidates do this nor I have tried this in interviews myself, is to to be well read about what a technological detail is about then draw parallels to what you do know in detail and explain how you are able to work with the technology the interviewer is talking about due to the similarities with your experience.<p>For example, working in a PHP shop, if I asked someone about Doctrine ORM and they responded that they have worked with Hibernate in Java and that allowed me to go into a line of questioning that discussed modelling and leads away from the specifics of Doctrine, I would be perfectly happy with such a response. On the other hand, if they outright dismiss it and say that they prefer to always right queries directly, I may need to question context and decide whether they are so inflexible about it that it would cause them issues when working with our codebase.",1454886382

I don&#x27;t think the case described in <a href=""https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=67153"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=67153</a> is actually a bug in either the compiler or the processor.  Rather, it&#x27;s the behavior you would expect if the compiler (at compile time) guesses wrong about whether a branch is likely to be taken or not.<p>Which choice is fastest on the depends on the runtime word list, and thus there is no reason to fault the compiler for either choice.  For the processor, the difference is simply that a &quot;branch not taken&quot; is faster than a branch taken. The fast version involves a loop that executes in a single cycle:<p><pre><code>   77.21 │210:┌─→add    $0x4,%rcx \n    0.66 │    │  cmp    %rcx,%r8  \n         │    │↓ je     260       \n    4.20 │219:│  mov    (%rcx),%edi \n    0.88 │    │  test   %r9d,%edi   \n         │    └──jne    210\n</code></pre>\nThe cmp/je and test/jne instructions fuse into on µop each, so that (incredibly) the processor can execute the remaining 4 fused µops at an iteration per cycle.  If the loop is rearranged so that the middle branch is taken, each iteration takes a minimum of 2 cycles instead.<p>The solution (as the author mentions in a parenthetical) is to give more information to the compiler with &quot;__builtin_expect&quot;.  I wasn&#x27;t able to test on Sandy Bridge or earlier, but my strong guess would be that Haswell and Skylake have a potential speedup, rather than a regression.  I&#x27;ll try to add a comment to the bug later tonight.",1454886360

That is, they&#x27;re on the stack by default like everything else in Rust, and there&#x27;s no implicit heap allocations.

As my link above discusses, each closure has a unique type, allowing monomorphisation to kick in and hence the compiler can easily optimise and inline calls to closures (as long as the author of the closure-taking function doesn&#x27;t opt-in to only allowing virtual dispatch).",1454886286

LLVM targets x86, x86-64, ARM32, ARM64, PowerPC, MIPS, SPARC, Hexagon, System z, TI MSP430, and XCore, as well as NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, and has some unofficial forks that target other niche architectures like AVR.

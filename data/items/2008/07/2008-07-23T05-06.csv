254114,comment,254021,254021,0,0,jfornear,,,"The topic of simplified browsing targeted solely to old people comes up all the time with my parents and friends' parents. From what I've collected, old people say they want easier this and that, but when it comes down to it, the individuals that continue to experience difficulty either do not take the time to learn new technology or are hindered by a disability.<p>If easier means different, how can you expect them to take the time to learn your new approach when they don't take the time to learn something as simple as Google search? Google search is just one huge text box in the middle of the display. It doesn't get much more straightforward. You type what you want to find and then sift through the results.<p>My mom is the biggest noob when it comes to computers. She doesn't see or expect buttons when she looks at a UI. My mom didn't grow up with GUI's for cable, video games, or computers like I did, but she has been practicing on her computer for the last year or two and is finally getting the hang of it just fine.<p>I think no matter what you do, a person not used to using computers isn't going to understand without first taking the time to learn the basics.<p>There is definitely room for improvement though, just don't target any particular age demographic. Someone will come up with something that will make web browsing easier and more efficient for everyone.",1216792499
254113,comment,254093,254093,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've always felt this way, and have never been able to understand why Java is thought to be great for ""average"" programmers.  Java is <i>hard</i>, at least for me.  Certainly much harder than Perl, Ruby, Smalltalk, Tcl, and Scheme (I haven't spent any time with Lisp).  I even find it harder than C, in general, though I suspect that's just a factor of how much code I've read/written in the languages...and I've never had to build the infrastructure in a C project that Java removes completely, as I've always been a contributor to an existing project rather than starting from scratch.  But, Java is certainly not a simple or concise language.  There's a lot to learn...""Core Java"" apparently requires two gigantic 1000+ page books.  While one can learn most of Scheme from a single tiny text.  Java has so many nooks and crannies that I feel like I'd never be able to learn it all.  Likewise, one can get a pretty good understanding of C by spending a weekend with K&R.  Simple but powerful languages hold more appeal for me.<p>But, I guess the thing I (and possibly Reginal and Giles) find hard about programming is not the thing people usually find hard about programming.  I think of myself as an ""average programmer"", but the thing that bothers me about programming is tedium and the fiddly bits.  The more scaffolding a program has, the less I enjoy working with it and the harder it is for me to grasp.  If a piece of code isn't <i>for</i> something, then I don't like it and find it really ugly, but also hard to understand.  So, Java is chock full of stuff that makes me zone out completely.  I've been surprised to find that PHP is hard for me, as well.  I always sort of assumed, ""Hey, I've met some really dumb PHP programmers...how hard can it be?""  Until I actually had to work on some PHP code.  It's so verbose.  Everything is a function call, even basic data structures.  So, I find PHP much harder than the other languages that I work in, even though it has a reputation for being easy.",1216792497

After several years, they tend to loose weight. This is actually why cystic fibrosis patients are thin also: their pancreas becomes plugged with mucus and they have problems digesting enough protein.

Has especially great insights on the people aspect of the journey (VC's, employees, family, partners, angel investors...etc).<p>'The Search' - talks about Google and search companies in general, how they started, how they developed their business model, and the evolution of the industry in general. Especially fascinating is Bill Gross's story, and how he started ToGo.com (later became Overture) and invented a lot of the things that people commonly only associate with Google. It was also the first time I read the in-depth story about the founding of Google. inspiring...<p>'Founders at Work' is terrific also. Can't wait for the second part.<p>I'll throw in an extra recommendation. Not exactly a book, but a podcast actually. It's called ""Venture Voice"". It a series of interviews with entrepreneurs (Ev Williams of Twitter/Blogger/Odeo, Jay Adelson of Revision 3 and CEO of Digg, Calicanis of Weblogs Inc, Kawasaki, Mena Trott of Six Apart, to name a few). You can think of it as an audio version of 'Founders at Work'. Those two are a real must especially for web entrepreneurs.",1216791222

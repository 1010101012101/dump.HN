They need a martyr story, Ellen Pao is getting harassed all over the place, people trying to doxx her, people photoshoping her pictures over and over, people making bad jokes about her (racists, sexist, etc...). They need to make it look like this is a bad thing, like she&#x27;s suffering, like the reaction of these people who are a minority of reddit are causing to the people administrating reddit. I think that would be good if it came from some mods of subreddits or from some rumors in random subreddits.<p>Seriously, I see Ellen Pao as the new Britney Spears. In a few years people will love her (if she hasn&#x27;t killed herself from all of this harassment).<p>5.? They could fire Ellen Pao and hire someone from the community.

They could make the whole management process of reddit more &quot;open&quot; like buffer does.<p>Eventually, things like that are doomed to happen. A company needs to fire people, needs to take decision that their users will not like so they can monetize their website, etc...

9829094,comment,9828644,9828644,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"The founder/engineer social class division is one of the reasons why I expect the Silicon Valley ecosystem to implode and will be disappointed if it doesn&#x27;t.<p>First, there are two types of founders: Made Founders and Hustling (it&#x27;s a nicer word than &quot;Marginal&quot;) Founders. Made Founders (often called &quot;serial entrepreneurs&quot;) already have it worked out that, unless they rip off their VCs, they&#x27;ll get a soft landing. I won&#x27;t say that they don&#x27;t work, but they have enough investor-rank friends that they don&#x27;t really worry about anything, because if their companies tank, they&#x27;ll be lined up with VP-level positions where they&#x27;ll probably make twice the salary that they had as founders (typically, founders don&#x27;t make more than $175k). They probably put in 30-60 hours per week, but they work on the fun stuff and have double-digit equity so... yeah. They worry more about managing up into the investor ranks than running a company, for obvious reasons. (If you build a successful company but lose control and most of your reward, you lost. If you fail but the investors like you and make you a Partner at their VC firm, you won.) It ain&#x27;t a bad gig, although it&#x27;s a bit boring because, well, you&#x27;re a corporate executive. Being a Made Founder is based on pre-existing social class; either something you&#x27;re born with, or something you luck into. Merit&#x27;s not a part of it. Hustling Founders are the ones who don&#x27;t have investor-level people pulling strings all the time and who really, really, really fucking have to pound the pavement-- and hope that a Made Founder doesn&#x27;t decide to compete in their space, because then they&#x27;re up against someone who&#x27;s going to have 50 times the capital.<p>In the 1960s, <i>all</i> founders were of the Hustling variety because the pedigreed people were still in banking, during the Bateman days when it wasn&#x27;t a real job (3-martini lunch), and in a time when the pedigreed asswipes still thought the West Coast unprestigious.<p>What the OP is describing is a cultural shift as pedigreed people with <i>generational</i> social connections jump into the game as Made Founders. They&#x27;ve never been employees or subordinates of any kind (except to VCs) so they don&#x27;t have the empathy that it takes to run a company, and they tend to be low on competence spectrum (since the mainstream business elite puts its successes in hedge funds and private equity to manage billion-dollar deals, and throws its failures into VC and VC-funded tech).<p>What hoodwinks a lot of people is that the Made Founders are great at presenting the appearance of Hustling Founders, and thereby they justify getting 100 times the equity as the employees they manage. In reality, most of the Hustling Founders (a middle-class crew) have been driven out and are unfundable due to a lack of social connections, and also because the amount of stress involved in dealing with VCs and abusive investor-level personalities is such a mental-health crusher that even normal people become paralytically neurotic after about 5 years in that game.",1435981641

9829055,comment,9827092,9827092,0,0,wslh,,,"It is good to start with the truth: currently making money selling desktop software is really hard and, in general, doesn&#x27;t payoff the amount of work you need to be there. We have a lot of examples of companies doing herculian work beyond Sublime Text and Atom which don&#x27;t have enough revenue. Part of this is related to the web and mobile trends but also the desktop software maturity. In Microsoft Windows you can find a lot of tools but very few assume that they need to pay for them, they can be very popular (look at the most downloaded desktop software) but the profits/users has a very low ratio. In general, the successful ones rely on a mature sales force or they are unicorns. I think it is a good start studying the current desktop ecosystem to see how hard it is.<p>Notwithstanding that, I recommend to think about a services/product business model more than in selling &quot;millions of units&quot; only. Although a little old now, I recommend Michael Cusumano&#x27;s work on this [1]. My small company uses (complex) desktop and server software products as a marketing tool for services and support.<p>Now the question is what is the minimum profit you will accept to make. Is it $ 100k / year, $ 200k or $ 1mm ? From that picture you can deconstruct how many units of your app/service/support you need to sell to be there. As a thumb rule I will say that selling few units for a higher price will be much easier than selling a lot of units for a few dollars. If you want to try, I would recommend start selling to SMB companies who have a budget for this.<p>Regarding finding ideas, talk to people who have real software problems in their companies.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ebusiness.mit.edu/research/papers/197_Cusumano_ProdSrvcsBusMod.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ebusiness.mit.edu/research/papers/197_Cusumano_ProdSr...</a>",1435980864

Given this, in my opinion &quot;Blacks commit crimes at around 5x higher rate than Whites&quot; is a fair claim.  I actually should have said 8x, I misremembered the article.<p>One interesting thing to me is that within parts of academia, it is not controversial to claim that Black people commit more crimes.  Such academics seek the causes of this difference in various sociological explanations.  You can see the discussion in the rest of the wiki article.  But <i>outside</i> of academia a very different story is told.  I believe that academics think that ordinary people cannot be trusted not to draw &quot;racist&quot; conclusions from the statistics about crime.

9829004,comment,9828088,9828636,0,0,teddyh,,,"A European perspective:  From about the 1950’s to the 1990’s, the USA was seen as <i>the</i> best place on Earth to be, bar none.  It was viewed as having the biggest and best (for some definition of “best”) of everything (military, industry, products, culture), and was seen as being committed to an almost Google-like “don’t be evil” policy.  Sure, there were exceptions, and individuals (and their administrations) were criticized, but they were seen as <i>exceptions</i> to a general good principle.  The American national pride was seen as a little over the top (especially the slightly creepy “pledge of allegiance” school ritual) but not completely out of the realm of the concievable, and a bit understandable given the USA’s status.<p>Then Bush, Iraq, and 9/11 happened, and the resulting PATRIOT act, TSA, NSA, etc.  Many were of course disillusioned with the USA before this (Washington Papers, CIA, etc.), but I think this was the point at which the view of the <i>European general public</i> shifted.  It was suddenly OK to express suspicion about the USA’s motives in public discourse, in a way which would have seemed tinfoil-hat-ish or far-left-extremist before.<p>Now I can come to the point:  The national pride of US citizens does <i>not</i> seem to have softened or changed.  On the contrary, it seems to have <i>hardened</i> in the face of opposition.  <i>This</i>, I feel, is the real emotional reason which Europeans have, to denigrate the USA at seemingly every opportunity: They feel that US citizens are far too proud of the USA when it has far too many flaws, and that Americans need to be put in their place, so to speak – taken down a notch.  I confess that I personally have occasionally succumbed to this way of thinking, especially when Americans have been proud of (or at least content with) specific things which are really not very good at all compared to other nations.<p>I do not excuse this behavior, I am merely trying to explain it.",1435979846

But to understand the mentality, just consider for a second that the OA is foaming at the mouth of a language that is merely inspired by LISP.<p>wrt the PHP thing, well, I cut my teeth on PHP, and frankly I didn't learn much by reading code I found early on.  After doing it for a couple years (and completing an MIT-based CS degree) I started to discover the flaws for myself and I was eventually well-trained enough to be able to find the good code.  If you know what to look for it's easy.  However what's popular in PHP world (ie. what you find on Google) is not necessarily good.  Compared to Ruby or Python, or hell, even Perl, it's just way harder to find good PHP code to learn from for a beginner.",1246096783

Quite so. Nobody goes quietly into the good night. Usually they rage and have to be dragged kicking and screaming into the darkness. ?",1246096542

676748,comment,676056,676560,0,0,daveungerer,,,"Elevated insulin levels are the body's natural way of trying to deal with elevated blood sugar levels.  They go hand in hand, so your question ""is chronically elevated sugar the problem or chronically elevated insulin?"" makes no sense.<p>Low GI carbs are good because they release energy slowly, which means the blood sugar rises less but for a longer period, which doesn't strain your body's insulin production capabilities.  Which means none of the complications normally associated with carbs, like weight gain, the need for even more high GI after a crash, diabetes, etc.",1246096127

Or does this statement/suggestion only hold when being employed by someone?",1246095625

As long as it's masked per default and I can unmask it when I'm sure it's not an important password and/or no one could see it I think it really makes sense.<p>Apple already does that for the wifi password and I really like it.",1246095244

It's basic due diligence, whether legal or ethical or not, and I expect prospective co-workers to do the same to me.  Moral: don't be a dick or a moron online, at least not in connection with your real name.<p>That said, the real peril is that of mistaken identity.  I almost missed out on a (mostly) enjoyable 2+ year relationship because my Google search revealed that the woman I was chatting with was an activist for various evangelical Christian causes.  Fortunately, before breaking contact with her, I asked her about it, and soon realized that Google was leading me astray.",1246095131

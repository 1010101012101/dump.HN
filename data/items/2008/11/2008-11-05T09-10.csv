It seems like NN activists should instead focus on keeping the market place(s) competitive. Everyone needs more than one viable ISP, and every ISP needs more than one viable upstream network to resell. I don't think we're there.",1225879130

It's nothing special.<p>However, I do like the simple design, especially the filter options that reflect the interests of the students.<p>Targeting niche audience might actually get them somewhere.<p>Digging on the site a little bit deeper, I realize all of the jobs are from big companies. This is hardly helping start-ups or students who want to start one.<p>Why don't they just build a student entrepreneur networking site? I see a lot more potential in that.",1225877755

They look to upper management (good luck there buddy boy!), and worse, their cubicle neighbors.<p>From personal experience, I can tell you that the cynical tendencies of the office will distort and magnify layoff gossip, spreading it like wildfire and killing productivity.  Managers, in general, must realize that workers are uncomfortable with an absence of information.  They will in most cases choose the most convenient sources to fill in the void.<p>It has been once said that all information is good, even if it is bad.  Those few that survive the latest brutal round of job cuts will expect a certain level of frankness from upper management to preserve motivation, as well as a sense of job security.  Therefore, I agree and say the best option is transparency, but only on one condition.  Cut once, cut deep, and prevent a demoralizing series of job layoffs that will only keep the workers guessing and the monster.com server busy.<p>I think the layoff blog is a great step; companies finally dishing the honesty and respect its workers deserve.",1225877178

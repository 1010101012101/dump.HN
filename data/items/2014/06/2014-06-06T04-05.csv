7856275,comment,7855455,7856135,7,0,curveship,,,"Let s = startups, b = bigcorps, z = zombies<p>1) In any of the transformations [(-,-,+),(-,+,-),(+,-,-)], the delta b/w numbers (s-b, s-z, b-z) changes by 0 or 2.  What this tells us is that if the delta is odd to start, it will always be odd, if even always even.<p>2) Since the final state will involve only one type left standing (or else the stronger could eat the weaker), we know that the final counts will be two at 0, one at something >0.  Since our losers end with an even delta (0), they must always have had an even delta.  In the scenario you proposed, that&#x27;s s and z (2055 - 2017 = 38).  So b, bigcorps, is going to be our winner.<p>3) Now that we know who will win, we need to find the maximum possible number of bs remaining.  Since each move reduces the total population by one, the maximum bs will be produced by the shortest sequence of moves that gets rid of all zs and ss.<p>4) As long as z>0 and s>0, our best move is to have z eat s, as it drops the population of z and s by 2. So our first sequence is to have all zs eat ss, leaving us with s = 38, b = 4023, z = 0.<p>5) When z = 0, our only possible move is b eats s, creating a z, which can then be eaten by an s to produce a b, thereby restoring b to its original count and lowering s by 2.  After repeating this sequence 19 times to get rid of the 38 ss, we&#x27;ll have s = 0, b = 4023, z = 0.<p>Ergo, maximal final state is 4023 bigcorps.",1402030709

I don&#x27;t know what the runtime breakdown is, most likely in the sorting routine, but if that&#x27;s the case the problem can be solved much faster but not resorting to generic stable_sort().<p>I summarize the author&#x27;s algorithm as follows: take an array of R^3 vectors, and for each element in the vector, perform the [+,-,-], [-,+,-], and [-,-,+] transform. So N numbers become 3N numbers, which is followed by a duplicate removal process faciliated by the sorting.<p>The improvement is that the duplicate removal can be accomplished without sorting.<p>Let&#x27;s say you have an array of R^3 already sorted. Then say you create 3 arrays each of which is created by &quot;shifting&quot; the array in each of the 3 directions. Call the original A, and the derived B0, B1, B2. Note that B0, B1, and B2 are each sorted since element within each array is adjusted in the same direction. Then all you need to do is to do a 3-way merge, which takes linear time.<p>I bet by doing this, the runtime could be significantly reduced. My guess is that it runs in the range of 10-30 seconds (instead of 335 seconds).",1402029269

Even most of Europe has more invasive data collection laws (in all European countries, the secret service and the IRS equivalent can tap/copy/... anything they want to without warrants, and any cooperation they request must be freely given on pain of imprisonment. Anybody who&#x27;s worked at a Euro ISP knows this. Nobody ever mentions it for some reason)<p>All European ISPs must give a certain organisation a command shell (sort-of) that allows them to copy any and all traffic to a specific customer without the ISP even knowing they&#x27;re doing it. They have to do this for free and provide free tech support. This is why cisco, alcatell, juniper, HP, ... both produce &quot;lawful intercept&quot; versions of all their network software [1]. Installation of these images in most of the world (not just Europe) is not optional.<p>Unlike in the US, the ISPs never get to see any warrants. Asking for that is a crime, that can land you in prison. &quot;Obstructing&quot; justice can also land both directors and techies in jail (ie. not promptly providing prompt tech support to idiot police officers who wonder why tapping an ADSL line does not tell them when the tapped person checks gmail on their phone). There are not allowed to be limitations. For example if you are an American customer of an ISP that operates in Europe, they can tap you (e.g. Liberty Global). And obviously, the government refuses to pay anything for the quite substantial effort required to implement all this.<p>ISPs only deal with a certain central organisation (it&#x27;s more-or-less interpol) that basically gives open tapping to a list of European organisations that doesn&#x27;t fit on a single page, and several organisations that aren&#x27;t even European.<p>So given this, what do you think the entire European telco, government, and ... industry should do ? Keep in mind that people working for this infrastructure is probably around 50 million people.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12-2SX/lawful/intercept/book/65LIch2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst65...</a>",1402028331

So they don&#x27;t have an incentive to go against this.<p>5) There is some limited value to the regulations : they are probably overkill, but they do keep out bad drivers. Bad as in criminals, and bad as in drunk and so on.<p>Bottom line : this is a problem with the democratic system itself, and specifically a point where it doesn&#x27;t agree with what the tech scene wants. Tesla has effectively the same problem.",1402027280

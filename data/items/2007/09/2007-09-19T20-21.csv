57058,comment,56957,56957,0,0,auferstehung,,,"I think a method of ranking news based on the number and quality of comments would be better than voting up and down.  This method would be somewhat analogous to page rank in that the rank of a story  (webpage) is indirectly determined by the comments (links) and quality of the comments.  Writing a comment is arguable less reflexive than clicking an arrow.<p>Also interesting news that was generating a good discussion could tend to persist and stay near the top.  This would encourge thoughtful comments as you are not penalized for taking some time to think about the matter rather than hastily shooting from the hip.<p> ",1190235402
57057,comment,57000,57000,0,0,rkts,,,"Awesome.  A lot of people revile Steve Sailer, but I think he's one of the best essayists writing today.<p>This quote in particular elegantly sums up the history of philosophy:<p>""To this day, most philosophers suffer from Plato's disease: the assumption that reality fundamentally consists of abstract essences best described by words or geometry. (In truth, reality is largely a probabilistic affair best described by statistics.)""<p>It's not so much the world that's probabilistic, though, as the human mind and the thoughts and abstractions we impose on the world.  Hume was the first philosopher to explicitly argue that the mind works this way, and modern research has supported him.<p>I think that, as Sailer briefly suggests, there is value in studying the works of skeptical philosophers like Hume: it gives you the tools to see through the kind of bullshit that philosophy is full of.  Because you don't just see it in philosophy.  It's there whenever people argue about politics or religion, and whenever a dreamy computer scientist rambles about ""objects"" and ""types"" and whatnot.  It's useful to able to refute these arguments by recognizing their meaninglessness.",1190235313

Voting on a story should be related to an action that the user is taking which implies an up/down vote.  <p>For example, in my Facebook application Wildfire stories are up voted only if you pass then on to your friends.   As you mentioned to me yesterday, delicious/popular is interesting because it's based on pages people bookmarked for themselves.<p>John.

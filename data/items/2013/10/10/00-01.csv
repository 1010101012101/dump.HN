I had an incident in Belize this year where I turned off airplane mode to connect to wifi on the boat I was on and my cellular radio auto-connected to Belize&#x27;s local mobile carrier without me realizing (I had international roaming enabled on my account). My phone started syncing and updating apps in the background and within 2 minutes of passive usage I had amassed $270 in data charges. Only. 2. Minutes. \nI plead my case when I got back to the states and they removed the charges without a thought (although I had to send in a written appeal). International data rates are ridiculous and it&#x27;s nice to see a carrier acting rationally.",1381366599

Firefox is the only fully open source browser to gain any significant traction, so HTML-DRM as the final blow to the &quot;guiding light that led the web out of darkness&quot; seems a little far-fetchd. (Nitpick: Webkit is not a browser, its a rendering engine)<p>At the end of the day I&#x27;m having trouble understanding what this really means for the Web. Hollywood was never going to stop using DRM. With all the various syndication deals with DRM-clauses in Hollywood contracts, I doubt <i>anyone</i> was going to step up and fight for DRM removal when TWC is blacking out CBS over transmission fees. At the same time, I don&#x27;t think HTML-DRM will cause Netflix to drop support for Firefox.

But COBOL is still with us and so will Java be with us for a long time. But the momentum is picking up on alternate JVM languages, in particular Grovy, Scala and Clojure. Of course there is also Python(Jython), JRuby, PHP and many others that run on the JVM, but Groovy, Scala and Clojure are the triumvirate that is picking up steam and will end up pushing Java down into the depths where, like C, it will remain as the tool of choice for building JVM libraries.<p>The Oracle JVM is also not the only JVM available these days and there are even some commercial JVMs that are higher performance than Hotspot. I think one could make a strong argument that the JVM will outlive Java itself by a large margin. Say, Java fades out of common usage by 2050 but the JVM is still going strong in 2150.",1381366518

6524933,comment,6521885,6524475,3,0,gwern,,,"> It is a highly contested assertion that IQ tests accurately measure I.Q. It&#x27;s completely possible that if you take a reasonably smart person and make them study for a specific type of I.Q. test, that he will score higher than he would have otherwise, even though his intellectual ability would remain unchanged over a broader spectrum of skills than the test involves. Therefore, it may not be a reliable measurement of I.Q.<p>It is not contested in the area in question; psychologists routinely use IQ tests without a qualm, and it is a consensus in the field that they are meaningful. See for example the consensus paper on IQ released in the wake of _The Bell Curve_ controversy or look at more recent review articles like Nisbett&#x27;s &quot;Intelligence: new findings and theoretical developments&quot;. Whatever the layman or politicians may think, the debate is <i>over</i>: if you make a good IQ test, it will estimate accurately general performance on all sorts of cognitive performance. If you destroy the accuracy of a given IQ test by training and then measure performance on the original variety of cognitive performance, this will immediately show up in the factorization and demonstrate how the IQ test&#x27;s accuracy has been destroyed, and IQ tests developed with different kinds of questions will not show the spurious increase, just like if you took a different thermometer and put it in the person&#x27;s armpit, it would show a different reading from the thermometer stuck in the mug of hot water.<p>> Your example makes no sense whatsoever, and you should have already known that before you typed it out.<p>My example is exactly analogous to the argument that was made.",1381365431

With the -MMD option, you create the .d file as a side-effect of the real compilation. Any change that would require the .d file to be rebuilt has to involve a change to the old dependencies as listed in the old .d file. So the source file will be recompiled. In order for a new dependency on a new header file to be added, an existing and remaining dependency needs to change to add &#x27;#include ...&#x27;. So the .c file will get recompiled because that file has changed and then you have a new .d file.<p>For C/C++, I have to subvert GNU make&#x27;s attempts to rebuild .d files by using $(wildcard) on them and inserting a /./ in the middle of the path.<p>Note that there are other cases where I do have a rule for building .d files and have them rebuilt. In particular for Fortran 90 modules. This occurs wherever you need to build the .d files first for the initial first build to be in the correct order. This is only an issue for C/C++ if you are invoking a program to generate C sources (e.g. rpcgen).

Before going back to grad school, my job required a long commute (easily 60 minutes each way). Getting up early bothered me, but the drive to work was fine as local radio morning shows were pretty good (though over the course of only 4 years of this commute, schedules changed removing 3 nationally syndicated shows, and 2 local shows before just setting on NPR...FM radio seems to be a cruel world).  However, driving home was the worst...just the worst, even when listening to music off of my mp3 player, if i was running late to leave by even a few minutes the commute home could take an extra 15.  I was much more stressed at the end of each day just from driving, and by the time i made and ate dinner i&#x27;d only really have ~2 hours to relax before having to go to bed to get up and start again.  The unhappiness timeline:<p>- Stress turned into a general depression that my weekdays were robotic (sleep, wake, drive, work, drive, eat, sleep)<p>- I found myself becoming a more aggressive driver (more stress = wanting to get home faster)<p>- My general attitude was changing for the worse<p>- I started to alienate my significant other<p>A friend suggested i read a book for some reason and i picked up the audio copy to kill some time on the drive home. This turned out to be a life changer. Instead of focusing on getting home as soon as i could, i was relaxing on my drive. Happiness timeline:<p>- I found myself sitting in my driveway to hear the end of a chapter<p>- Getting home didn&#x27;t mean i needed to retreat to the study for time to unwind<p>- I started driving slower and less aggressive (even letting people cut me off, etc)<p>- My relationship with my SO improved<p>- I felt smarter. My usual reading list is text book chapters to better understand a concept, but i really felt like i was a generally smarter person by including non-fiction.<p>- Most important is that i didn&#x27;t feel like i was wasting time.  Driving became a hobby in some sense, as opposed to a delay of when i can start/end my day.<p>By the end of my tenure i sometimes looked forward to my commute, only so i could keep listening. Of course audio books may not be your game, but the thesis is that if you find some way to make you feel like you&#x27;re not wasting your time then you&#x27;ll most likely not mind the commute (for example, my mom calls her mother, my grandmother, everyday on the commute home).",1381363586

Maybe there&#x27;s an encoding problem with one of the candidate names this year.

Because you have to test your app with the current candidates, photos, parties, news feeds, electoral boundaries including all the latest redistricting, and all of that.<p>So yes, it is <i>made up</i> test data, with &quot;predicted&quot; results based on whatever. Recent polling plus a good dose of randomization, perhaps.<p>You just hope and pray that your test data never leaks out onto a live feed.<p>But it&#x27;s a balancing act. You need to test your code on real devices, real browsers, and the whole works. And you have to be ready to swap in your live feed election night and have it all work seamlessly.<p>Should be easy, right?<p>Now consider the dynamics of election reporting. You have a deadline. A deadline that <i>will not budge</i>. You do your best, but you&#x27;re probably not going to get much sleep the week before the election. And sometimes you make a mistake.<p>That happened with one of the US primary elections. We had a test feed leak out onto a live page for a couple of hours, and man did it make the news.

It&#x27;s not like the &quot;decade-old&quot; paper has become less correct over time.  I mean, it&#x27;s great that MD is finally close to predicting something that could be predicted a decade ago with much simpler methods, but that isn&#x27;t saying a lot.  Plus, as the other commenter pointed out, there&#x27;s a complicated cross-validation problem that biases the results you&#x27;re reporting.<p>In truly blind tests (i.e. CASP), MD force fields just aren&#x27;t that good at predicting structure from sequence.  The usual counter-argument is that they aren&#x27;t meant to work with non-MD methods (fair enough, I guess), but you don&#x27;t have to try very hard to find reasons not to trust them.  MD simulations  have always been very finicky things, requiring lots of manual intervention to get &quot;right&quot;.",1381363279

There is also the potential yearly service contracts that may be negotiated. Getting the original developer of a program to maintain it is a good idea for Enterprise clients. They can also develop a training package and sell it with his help.",1381363267

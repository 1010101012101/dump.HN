The developer is active with the service, very open and honest, and gives great customer service.<p>If another similar service offered significantly more features or an otherwise better product I might be convinced to switch, but it would take a lot of convincing.<p>The other two products that come to mind as fitting in this category are Sublime Text and Balsamiq mockups. Both are great products, but are backed by even better companies / people.<p>In the offline world, I feel the same way about my (State Farm) insurance agent. His office has bent over backward when necessary to ensure things are taken care of.<p>Great customer service, honesty, and listening to the customer goes a long ways toward building a successful business. This is why Pinboard will thrive and profit while Delicious continues to sputter.",1317315581

It doesn't make sense to put that money in an investment earning 1-5% while you have a credit card at 13% and a car loan at 7%.<p>EDIT: What's with the downvotes without comment?  Is it unreasonable to suggest that someone should pay off debt before investing?",1317315580

Your CEO friend needs to grow a pair and demote his CTO co-founder. Ideally, he would sell his co-founder on the idea of doing this voluntarily. This will not be an easy discussion.<p>Titles and hierarchy matter in a startup because someone has to be able to make decisions in the face of disagreement. Decision making by committee leads to a lot of really mediocre decisions--like keeping a co-founder as CTO despite being unqualified for the job!<p>This decision-by-committee dynamic happened early on in my current startup. Mostly, the problem was engineers having an equal say in marketing and financing decisionsa topic they were not focused on or very familiar with, yet had strong opinions about. This was dumb. It took one of the founders of Netflix giving me/us a swift kick in the ass to get over it. No longer. We now divide and conquer. The company is much better for it.<p>Every company needs a CEO. And if the CEO is not technical, then the company is eventually going to need a CTO as well. But that's about it in terms of C-level officers. A small company should not have 4 chiefs. What that really means is the company has NO chief.<p>Being a C-level person means being responsible for long term big picture shit and management and leadership, not just coding. For myself, I am extremely fortunate to have a visionary co-founder and CTO with real leadership qualities. He is a partner in the true sense of the word. I expect him to stay CTO for a long, long timeunless I decide to demote myself and make him the CEO. (Might happen, who knows?) Regardless, the buck has to stop somewhere. And that somewhere is the CEO. There can only be one.",1317315360

He wouldn't bring up the other women on purpose, but if one of them wanted to spend some time together on Thursday and my dad had a date with a different one on Thursday, then he would be honest with her. He was honest with them all at the beginning though; you have to define what you want and expect early. Not all girls will be ok with this kind of relationship, but a surprising number will be. It probably has to do with common fears that women have concerning the guy becoming needy or too attached. Dating multiple women at the same time signals that your expectations are modest and you are not looking for anything serious, which takes the pressure off of the girl.<p>But beware: one of those women my dad was dating turned out to be my mom.

The cost to develop, market, and sell a console (e.g. Playstation, XBox) far exceeds the sticker price for each console sold.  In 2005, each XBox 360 sold represented a loss of $126 for Microsoft.  They make that money back on licensing fees they charge to game and accessory vendors, as well as through XBox Live subscription fees and on-console purchases.<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.gamespot.com/news/6140383/microsoft-taking-126-hit-per-xbox-360"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamespot.com/news/6140383/microsoft-taking-126-hi...</a><p>Mobile phone carriers also employ this model.  They often give away phones for free or at a token price of $99, when the hardware easily costs hundreds more.  In exchange, you have to sign a 2 year contract, where you promise to pay them $1200-2400 whether you use the phone or not.<p>Dell used this model for a while with their Dell-branded LexMark printers.  They would give the printer away for free with any computer purchase, but the printer only accepted Dell-branded ink, which was identical to the LexMark ink, but had a special chip that identified it.  They sold this ink at quite a markup over the LexMark ink to make their money back on the printer loss.<p>To be successful at this, you need to have a captive audience and a lot of traction.  The phone company has it easy because you sign a contract.  With the video game console maker, you take a big gamble if the console doesn't take off (ask Atari how this works out).  If you are planning on something like the Dell printer, be careful that counterfeiters don't steal your market.",1317315052

I thought so before, and it's inescapable now.  HP would only have been throwing good money after bad to continue.<p>I like WebOS (I used a Pre for a while) and sure, it would be great if HP could somehow be a significant player in the tablet market.  I just don't see how it can happen.  HP was late to the party and there's massive competition.<p>The only justification I could see for continuing to sell the TouchPad is if customers (primarily business customers) came to feel that HP's offerings were incomplete without it, and that drove them to other suppliers for desktops and laptops.  I suppose it's possible things could get to that state, but I don't see it happening soon.

Change can be really tough if you've stuck with a site through that many years.  But in the end, the old Delicious isn't changing - it's dead.  What now exists is an entirely new site under the delicious coat of arms.   What users dont understand is that there is no ""going back"".  It's upsetting that your beloved site is dead, but mourn and move along - any attempt to revive it is folly.<p>AVOS is ultimately at fault here.  They didn't want to hurt the feelings of the Delicious old guard, so they made it sound like everything was ok.  But everything -wasn't- ok with the product those users fell in love with, it was being obliterated.  The best thing AVOS can do now is help users come to terms with the present reality.<p>Ultimately, the re-launch was the right move - the delicious of 2004 cant survive in today's web.  But AVOS's communication around the transition just wasnt frank enough.  They should have just held a funeral.",1317312572

And then lots of much cheaper vaccines will flood the market.</i><p>I think his point is that much of the problem of preventing the spread of HIV has less to do with the science of killing the virus, and more to do with the difficulty of actually getting it in the hands of people who need it.  There are already very cheap, readily-available ways of preventing HIV transmission (condom use comes to mind), but people aren't using those.  The reasons are varied, but some cite misinformation, cultural misconceptions, government ineptitude, and so on.  Even if there were a 99% effective HIV vaccine that were as cheap as water, it still wouldn't make it into the hands of every person in the developing world.  Proof of that is the fact that we can't even get water to all of these people.",1317312567

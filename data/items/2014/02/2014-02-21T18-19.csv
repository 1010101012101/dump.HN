7278633,comment,7277947,7277947,4,0,peterwwillis,,,"(sorry, ranty opiniony comment)<p>Why do people care about the numbers of women in Computer Science classes? Because, they say, it shows some inherent discrimination against women in the industry. (which totally exists, but mainly as a bigger cultural issue that affects everyone along gender lines) If you ask how that could be (as nobody is actually barring women from signing up for classes) the most popular theory is that gender stereotypes combined with an antagonistic male environment leaves women with little choice but to abandon the field.<p>So the answer has been to make more opportunity for women to join the industry by making it more attractive to them or reducing gender-related friction. Many employers are pushing to find more women in technology/computer science and give incentives to hire them, and in cases like this, change curriculum for schools to make the subject seem more &quot;beautiful & joyful&quot;. And it seems like it might be working - more women are now in classes, and one would assume, may some day soon be evening the gender gap in tech jobs.<p>But what&#x27;s the end result to merely bringing more women into the industry? Has the culture shifted? Are salaries evening out? Is sexism dead? The people pushing for more women in technology seem to think that by merely increasing the number of women in the field, all of these things will happen. But realistically, none of these things are accomplished just because there&#x27;s more women in technology.<p>Compare it to when President Obama was elected, and certain people claimed &quot;racism is dead&quot; because we finally elected a black President. Is racism really dead? Did the culture shift to become more understanding? Did the overall quality of life for black people increase? Did they get higher salaries, or more economic or political power? My casual observation indicates these things did not happen. The culture was not affected, and so, the same institutional problems <i>caused by problems in the culture</i> persist.<p>And this is what will happen regarding women in technology. Anyone can change their experiment to fit their expected results, and then when they get those results claim they had success. But that&#x27;s not a cause for celebration. What would be good is if we actually attack the cause of inequality - our cultural differences and biases - to make it so that women are not an exception to a rule, but an equal part of a common community. Merely adding more women to computer science classes is the equivalent of a misogynist saying &quot;Sure, you can have a computer - in the kitchen.&quot; The sexism, gender stereotypes, and cultural conflicts will continue to exist until those are addressed directly.",1393008851

7278628,comment,7277947,7278141,18,0,alphaoverlord,,,"I am a current UCSF medical student and I majored in statistics in undergrad. I program in R and python. In undergrad, did consider doing an internship at a tech company as a data scientist, so I feel like I understand the perspective from both sides.<p>That said, I feel this is entirely a false dichotomy - there are actually very few people choosing between nursing and computer science, and it is not &quot;diverting some of these students to computer science rather than remaining in health care&quot;. They are simply very different students and workforces with different motivations, strengths, and weaknesses.<p>I am sure we can agree that there are many fields that are worse off than computer science. Retail, administration, and many disciplines don&#x27;t have the flexibility or financial compensation. To me, in some ways, it does sound like sour grapes when one says &quot;well, look women have nursing. They make good money.&quot; Regardless whether healthcare is a good field, that creates a false dichotomy when there are many people (both male and female) who aren&#x27;t in these fields.<p>Even digging into this false dichotomy, it is another discussion whether healthcare is actually more flexible, has fewer hours, and is a better career choice than software development. The grass is always greener on the other side, but I would say that only in healthcare does a significant proportion of the workforce have to work overnight shifts, 30 hour workdays, and have to deal with relatively hazardous or infectious materials.<p>I love medicine, it&#x27;s a great field, and I really enjoy having an impact on people&#x27;s lives. But similarly, there are intangibles in software development like the satisfaction of creating something and doing things that can touch people far away. I think that to split these professions into &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot; is a huge disservice and it brings nothing to the discussion to say some female predominant fields have good earning potential.<p>PS. UCSF medicine is typically between 47 - 54% female each year. Not sure where you got the 58% statistic. There are a lot of applicants, so the administrators probably have a lot of flexibility on how they want to shape the class demographics.",1393008824

7278586,comment,7277947,7277947,12,0,theautocrat,,,"CS10 TA here: \nI have been involved in the development of this course for almost 4 years and in that time I watched it grow from a small 80 student pilot course to a 220 student CS goliath. In my opinion the growth in popularity of this course is representative of an underwhelming high school CS education. For students without some previous experiences, CS61A as an introduction can be brutally discouraging. This fact spurred the creation of a course designed to give prospective CS majors a first foundation. This is by no means a thin foundation. CS10 has students learning concepts including complex tree recursion, implementation of Map Reduce, Lambda functions, as well as techniques for processing large sets of data and understanding the effects of concurrency. In just one semester a student can go from not knowing what variables and “if” statements are, to building complex projects involving game-tree searches and parallel processing.<p>CS10 represents an opportunity for those who never considered Computer Science until they reached a university setting. For many the study feels unapproachable, and the inviting environment of CS10 allows anyone with a curiosity to explore their capacity. In the ongoing debate of “should everyone program”, while I am uncertain about the prospect of making CS education a compulsive requirement, I do believe a net should be cast out to catch those who perhaps never realized their interest and potential. CS10 is that net. It is often the beginning of a student’s journey and inspires a life long love.<p>It’s easy to joke that about CS10 as a CS daycare. A place where the “non-serious” can feel like they are involved in a trendy field of work. But this does not recognize the success of CS10. With a majority of CS10 alums continuing on to CS61A, the demographic of students (including female enrollment rates) will begin to change. This is a new course and it will take time to percolate up to graduation rates, but the student’s in CS61A with a background in CS10 are not only prepared, but often far beyond those who directly jump into CS61A.<p>CS10 was the first experience I ever had with Computer Science and inspired me to pursue a career in the field. I love CS and sharing that love with my students in CS10 is my passion.",1393008411

Where I ended up is that I had no real-world use cases that would benefit from Erlang, so I just kind of atrophied with it.  It seems to me like Erlang is really really good at building programs that can be modeled with message passing (like chat), but a lot of problems are difficult to map to that paradigm (or perhaps my mind just has trouble envisioning how to do it yet).  The closest I got was starting to use it to write a distributed Web crawler, but I ended up using scrapy (a Python framework) because the string manipulation was annoying with Erlang, and scrapy already had a lot of features that I would have had to re-implement on my own.  But as I&#x27;m starting to try and manage crawler distribution with Celery and RabbitMQ, I find myself starting to think more and more about how Erlang would probably do this bit in particular better, so I might return to it.<p>The language that I&#x27;ve since discovered I really want for most tasks is Haskell.  I&#x27;ve been programming Ruby full-time for the last few years, and I&#x27;ve grown really jaded with it.

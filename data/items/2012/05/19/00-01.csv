3994776,comment,3993394,3993394,26,0,grellas,,,"Steve Blank is a respected Valley veteran who has written highly insightful and informative materials about the history and development of the Valley (see <a href=""http://steveblank.com/secret-history/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steveblank.com/secret-history/</a>) and so his opinion is worthy of note.<p>That said, I have been in the Valley since 1968, have watched its ups and downs professionally since the early 1980s, and can say without question that it is currently bursting at the seams with opportunity from every conceivable angle. Yes, the days when silicon was king are well past their ""golden"" stage but they have been replaced by an era where founders have decided leverage and power to realize great visions without having to overcome the resource/knowledge barriers that predominated just a decade ago, where innovative investors have more ability than ever to leverage early-stage situations in ways that used to be monopolized by just a few top-tier VCs, and where the disruptive impact of technological change generally is leaving old-guard companies staggering as startups who vigorously challenge them proliferate - all to the great benefit of society at large. Plans are afoot at every top-tier company - Facebook, Google, Apple, etc. - to grab control of the whole process and eventually dictate to others how they might participate in it, but such plans have not yet succeeded even when they once seemed almost inevitable (thinking of 90s Microsoft here). As long as companies remain free to innovate, there likely will be successive stages of greatness in the Valley (and, of course, elsewhere where comparable elements exist) and it is a mistake, in my view, to attempt to label any particular outstanding stage in the past, or any particular mode of growth, as ""golden"" in some special way. As long as human nature is what it is, enterprise will take many forms, each suitable to its time and no one form more particularly special than the other. The key is to capitalize on the opportunities as they exist, leaving history to play itself out as it will.",1337389106

But the big huge fall, then the huge rise might just be triggered by silly trading algorithms, maybe?<p>Like you said, Zynga and Facebook are presumed to be highly correlated in terms of value. But, Zynga needs facebook more than the other way round. I think (and this may just be utterly wrong), that the steep fall in facebook's value triggered an even steeper fall in Zynga's share price, which then cascaded to panicked investors selling their shares to lower it even more.<p>The real funny thing however, is the steep rise again. I am tempted to venture a guess that everyone was watching the trades to see who would make the first move, and then piggyback on them.<p>Sort of like a room full of people with guns pointed at each other. No one really wants to make the first move, but as soon as someone does, the only chance of surviving would be to start shooting.",1337388885

He's 29, and despite having reasonable writing skills seems to have expected a Beemer and a blonde upon graduation.<p>He also seems to signal that he's far more into what a job gives him than what he can bring to a job in terms of skill. This is something that is easily sniffed out, even just through his writing. Oh, he gives the usual ""hard work, sacrifice, and a bit of luck,"" bit, but then goes on to blame HR, the economy, etc instead of applying any rigor to his own skills and experience.<p>It's never been easy to break into a job. The idea that a college degree is a Golden Wonka ticket to riches and Everlasting Gobstoppers needs to die.<p>If you don't have the entrepreneurial spirit to create your own job/startup/career, then you're going to be a piece of phytoplankton, carried by the vagaries of the ocean's currents. There are jobs for people lacking this motivation, but they're not the ones with ""I wanted the tailored suits, the chance at a high income, the BMW, the prestige, the respect, and the power.""<p>And I have to say that this isn't particularly credible from what I've witnessed:<p>""due to job-hunt and financial issues, my age group finds it extremely hard to go out and be in social settings, so the usual networking and schmoozing that previous generations indulged in isn't nearly as possible for us""<p>And finally, playing the blame game with the faceless and apparently evil minions of HR is just ridiculous. In my experience, HR tends to weed out people so as not to waste a hiring manager's time. And in 90% of the people I've seen hired, the manager took their resume to HR to have it vetted after already having received recommendations for the applicant. In other words, if you're trying to get to the hiring manager through HR, you're doing it wrong.",1337388681

Often, in the mornings before his meds kick-in, he lacks sufficient impulse control to avoid hitting his mother (also my wife -- the English language seems to lack a single word which denotes both relationships) or threatening her with physical violence.  The differences in behavior are striking in their contrast.  While I don't like the idea of ""medicating away"" a problem which could be solved via better parenting, I don't see how we can possibly be effective parents if we had to spend most of our time with him (1) protecting his little brother from his aggression, (2) protecting physical possessions, or (3) attempting to correct behaviors which himself seems to wish he did not have but can not stop due to lack of impulse control.

If you're someone with code who's in a hurry, you benchmark as realistically as you can manage and hope you didn't flub the implementation, and that your data collection was statistically okay. If you're Donald Knuth, you define a simplified but somewhat realistic processor model and derive expressions for how much time your algorithm takes, and there's your answer. This is nice, but a lot of work, and it becomes positively nightmarish if you want accuracy on modern processors. If you're an Intro to Algorithms class, you look at the asymptotic complexity -- mergesort is O(n lg n), the (NP-complete) 3SAT problem is O(2^(n^k)) for some constant k, and so on. This gives good intuition a lot of the time, but not always. Insertion sort typically beats mergesort for small n, there are a lot of 3SAT problems that can be solved very easily, caches are all the time doing crazy stuff, and in general the world is complicated. We're interested in getting computers to solve problems in a reasonable amount of time; what are we to do?<p>I know this isn't exactly an answer to your question, but I really wish that people had said more about this in college, and I wanted to talk about it.",1337385944

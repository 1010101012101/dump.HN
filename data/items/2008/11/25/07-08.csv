And surely the emphasis on parental intervention would hold for kids addicted to anything, not just gaming.<p>I wonder what ""addiction"" means if not simply a habit that you'd like to stop? By this definition I'm as addicted to (say) coffee or sugar as I've ever been to anything. A big part of whether or not people call something ""addiction"" seems to have to do with the social acceptability of the habit.",1227599308

376144,comment,375157,375157,0,0,patio11,,,"My day job (central Japan, if you were Japanese you'd have heard of it) figured we'd get the best of both worlds: bring cheap Indian engineers to Japan.  Pay them cheap junior Japanese wages for a year while bringing them up to something approaching our quality standards for domestic labor.  Return them to India so that they can spread what they learned among the rest of the engineers who cost 25% of engineers in central Japan.<p>Not sure if it will be successful or not but I can't say I mind, as I'm employed precisely because the company sees the rest of the world as being full of opportunities.<p>On a tangentially related note, my previous job (also in central Japan) involved working with another Indian.  At the time we were both translators.  After leaving that job he took a job at the rubber company.  After two years of training they sent him back to India to be the assistant to the Japanese head of their Indian factory -- I think his actual title is VP, but his real job is right-hand-man.   The company pays him every single yen of a Japanese manager's salary (except in rupees), and my friend, quote, lives like a king such as one does not hear about except in fairy tale books.<p>So yeah, there is something to be said for brain circulation.  Which makes me wonder -- when I go back to America, do I count?",1227598297

Subjectively they seem to work, but I have no objective way to quantify how well they work.<p>My favorite question to ask involves walking through a tree structure and summing up a particular property of all the leaf nodes. It can be done recursively or (preferably) iteratively. About half the candidates can't really do it. I often see answers that only process two levels of the tree, or aren't thread safe, or include lots of duplicate code, or simply don't work at all.<p>Joel Spolsky has some good suggestions on the subject.\n<a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing...</a>",1227597507

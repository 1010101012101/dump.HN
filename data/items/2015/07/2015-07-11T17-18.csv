There&#x27;s actually quite a few people who prefer Beats&#x27; audio, none of that really has much to do with audio tech, but rather with equalizers.<p>i.e. it&#x27;s not just style or fashion, it&#x27;s also sound that really matters. There are quite a few &#x27;blind test&#x27; videos on youtube where people prefer the Beats headphones to the technically superior ones.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that when people prefer Beats&#x27; audio, that the audio is &#x27;better&#x27;, it&#x27;s just &#x27;better to them&#x27;. An objective standard of good audio one could argue is audio that sounds &#x27;as it is&#x27;, which is where Beats fails. Beats doesn&#x27;t do that, it deforms the audio to make the bass heavier. And so lots of popular music with young people who like bass, sounds better with Beats, than a more natural headphone which recreates sounds much better.<p>In short, yes Beats is also about audio, and it&#x27;s not &#x27;better or worse&#x27;, just like there&#x27;s taste in food, fashion, style etc, there&#x27;s also a taste in audio.<p>That doesn&#x27;t fully explain Beats&#x27; popularity, of course. There are cheap headphones with equalisers that are bass-heavy that aren&#x27;t as popular, and that can all be explained like you did with differences in style, fashion, recognition etc. But only mentioning this fails to recognise that there are groups of people who genuinely prefer deformed sound and prefer Beats&#x27; audio over even more expensive, technically far superior headphones&#x27; audio, regardless of style/fashion etc.",1436637350

His point was that a lot of people who say they (and by extension society, this part is important) don&#x27;t need privacy probably don&#x27;t need privacy because their privilege protects them. So then the goal has to be to convince them that their privileged position makes them a special case, and that they should care about the unprivileged. It isn&#x27;t just white people who have privilege, that&#x27;s just an example.<p>This general idea really isn&#x27;t controversial, but the terminology elicits very strong negative reactions in people for some reason (I honestly don&#x27;t understand it). If I pointed out that the TSA screens darker-skinned people with extra vigor, often inconveniencing those people, most people would agree with me.

Many countries provide strong protections against censorship by law, but none of these protections are absolute and frequently a claim of necessity to balance conflicting rights is made, in order to determine what can and cannot be censored.

The first two are mostly self-evident...in terms of improving the bottom-line...well, I often go to the NYT for breaking news. For a given event, they&#x27;ll often have a main story which they update throughout the day. The obvious problem is that if I&#x27;ve read it once, I have to re-read the entire story throughout the day, and mentally parse out the updated bits.<p>So why not have, for _every_ story, a &quot;History&quot; link, or even a _feed_ of latest changes, so that readers who re-visit a story can quickly see the atomic updates? For my own reading habits, this would cement the NYT has a place to go to for developing stories...the transparency/accuracy bit are just icing on the cake.<p>This issue of having an in-house Newsdiffs was brought up by the public editor back when Jill Abramson was still editor:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/opinion/sunday/26pubed.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/opinion/sunday/26pubed.htm...</a><p>Here&#x27;s what she said:<p>> <i>Right now, tracking changes is not a priority at The Times. As Ms. Abramson told me, it’s unrealistic to preserve an “immutable, permanent record of everything we have done.”</i><p>I can&#x27;t speak for her true motives or intentions...but part of the problem here is technical ignorance. Her perception seems to have been that tracking changes would have been too much of a burden -- and she is justified in thinking this if she has never worked with something that uses a diff-like program...and in my experience, this includes most <i>news people...in a newsroom, editing and re-editing stories and supplying reasons (i.e. as in a correction) is a very manual process. If a newsroom is using WordPress, sure, they know of the concept of article versions...</i>but they don&#x27;t really grok the ability for machines to create timestamped diffs<i>.<p>However, if Ms. Abramson was familiar with the kind of system that Github (or Wikipedia, for that matter) uses, she would see that keeping an immutable, permanent record is actually quite easy for machines to do. So to create a inhouse change-log-per-article would be quite easy, technically, and with some interface work, it&#x27;d be a very welcome feature to more than a few readers, IMO.<p></i> edit: In terms of &quot;most news people&quot; not knowing diff...I&#x27;m basing this on anecdotal experience with non-programming investigative journalists who, among all journalists, have the most to benefit from understanding the implications of an efficient document diff, but I haven&#x27;t worked with any who demonstrated that grasp. A common scenario is having two versions of some important document and wanting to see every change made. A diff would not be perfect, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be, it just needs to <i>triage</i> possible changes to further investigate.",1436635079

9870611,comment,9870347,9870347,0,0,pixelmonkey,,,"&quot;This is a challenge that journalism faces today -- how to fairly update and keep stories current while informing readers as best we can.&quot;<p>I work in and around the media industry, and I don&#x27;t think most publishers see this as a &quot;challenge&quot; -- they have other things to worry about (like how to survive post-print, how to operate in an Internet ecosystem with Google/Facebook/Twitter/YouTube, etc.)<p>Instead, I see a lot of excitement around the ability of journalists to update their work after they publish it -- one of the few upsides, in fact, of the Internet, from their standpoint. Just as Wikipedia articles get better over time, some important pieces of journalism do, too -- with the guidance of new information or challenges to the original writing.<p>But look, the Internet isn&#x27;t print. You can publish something at a URL, then change that URL&#x27;s content. That&#x27;s not a crime and it isn&#x27;t worrying -- it&#x27;s built-in to the medium.<p>Just like nothing makes the moment of publication special, nothing makes the moment of re-publication or re-writing special.<p>The New Yorker did a nice piece on the Internet archive, who is trying to &quot;solve&quot; this problem by periodically archiving the web. They pointed out that when Tim Berners-Lee invented HTTP, he considered the idea of versioning, but ultimately discarded it.<p><pre><code>    In 1989, at CERN, the European Particle Physics 
    Laboratory, in Geneva, Tim Berners-Lee, an English
    computer scientist, proposed a hypertext transfer 
    protocol (HTTP) to link pages on what he called 
    the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee toyed with the 
    idea of a time axis for his protocol, too. One 
    reason it was never developed was the preference 
    for the most up-to-date information: a bias against 
    obsolescence. But the chief reason was the premium 
    placed on ease of use. “We were so young then, and 
    the Web was so young,” Berners-Lee told me. “I was 
    trying to get it to go. Preservation was not a 
    priority. But we’re getting older now.”

It has the effect of systematically decreasing the standard deviation in developer salaries. Poor negotiators (and some poor performers), of course, love having access to this salary information as pointing to a public average is any easy way to ask for more money without having to put much effort into actually negotiating. Great negotiators, on the other hand, are getting salaries far above the median for their positions and the additional information wouldn&#x27;t help them at all. I strongly suspect that if salaries were public companies would be far less willing to give in to great negotiators as a single isolated case could easily cause cascading demands from other employees.<p>(Note that salary ranges/averages are irrelevant if you&#x27;re a great negotiator except as a story-telling tool. All you should be playing with is your BATNA and the company&#x27;s BATNA.)<p>If you don&#x27;t think open salaries have a negative effect on top engineer salaries, look at how little Buffer is paying.[0]<p>In the status quo, open salaries are a tax on poor negotiators which companies and good negotiators split.

I can be in a meeting and feel a gentle (and silent) tap on my wrist, take a quick glance, and go back to paying attention. It&#x27;s much more subtle than having your phone vibrate loudly, picking it up, and stowing it away again. You wouldn&#x27;t think so, but in practice it is.<p>> I think obesity statistics bear out how much people generally care about their own health.<p>I was surprised at how quickly and readily I started going along with my watch&#x27;s insistence to get up off my butt and walk around from time to time. I don&#x27;t know why I obey my watch when that&#x27;s something I should be doing on my own, but I&#x27;m no longer neglectful about it. Also, don&#x27;t underestimate the value of gamification. I now get points and awards for standing throughout the day, walking lots, and exercising. It&#x27;s dumb and I have no excuse for not doing those things without my watch pestering and then rewarding me. And yet, now I&#x27;m walking more.<p>But back to the notifications. I&#x27;ve said this here before, but I was amazed at the silent navigation feature. Whenever I request a route through Apple Maps (on my phone or my watch) and start it, I can put my phone in my pocket and start walking. When I get to an intersection, my watch gives one series of taps if I&#x27;m supposed to turn left and a different one if I should turn right. I can walk through sketchy neighborhoods with my head held high, without wearing the &quot;I&#x27;m lost - rob me!&quot; signal of hunching over my phone. I just keep moving until it tells me to change direction. I swear, it&#x27;s like a superpower. I&#x27;m not even kidding.<p>And maybe that&#x27;s my final answer: The Apple Watch enables you to... project the Internet onto reality. You can get much of the same effect with phone apps, but a phone doesn&#x27;t have the intimacy to really make the bridge between your data and the outside world. On paper it doesn&#x27;t sound like that big of a deal, but after wearing it around for a little while I&#x27;d sure hate to give it up.",1437518827

Researchers will have good ideas for how to automate job functions, but be unable to get the funding because only a few thousand humans do that particular job and it is cheaper to pay to train humans (times a few thousand) than it is to fund AI research (once).<p>There are precedents for stalls. Think about garments. The sewing machine automates the process of passing the needle through the cloth. That is a big deal and causes a dramatic step change in productivity. Then what? Not much. For a hundred years and perhaps a little longer yet garment making remains at the same level of automation, with huge numbers of persons working in factories using the same old tool.<p>That is why my crystal ball is cloudy. The penetration of robots into job functions that have non-huge numbers of employees depends on coming up with clever hacks analogous to the invention of the sewing machine. Without a clever trick, AI researchers might still be able to brute force things (imagine an industrial robot programmed to hold a manual needle, sewing needle-and-thread human style) but it will be too expensive and not replace human workers.<p>I imagine the clever tricks trickling in a few per decade, dragging out the automation of the economy over a century or two (or three).",1437518258

Personally, I prefer security, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d say otherwise if someone was blocking me due to an old, outdated, policy.<p>What happens is the application will end up requiring dozens of roles juggling easily a hundred (discrete) privileges.<p>The LDAP, AD, X.500 enterprise directory you have to integrate with will not have that granularity so a whole set of interfaces will be needed to map group(s) from the directory to role(s) and then you need an overlay to allow super users to customize the imported users.<p>And you somehow need to handle the case where user disappear from the directory without breaking auditing. And you need to grow bulk modification interfaces and import interfaces for those user/roles/privileges.<p>And then somehow make the UI human usable. And suddenly you&#x27;ll need special &quot;users&quot; for anonymous session that are API launched, a whole API authentication layer and your load balancer now suddenly need to be session aware, and they want single-sign-on.<p>And we&#x27;ve not actually implemented any core functionality, just satisfied the security dude that this will be SoX/HIPPA/ISO-27001 compliant.",1437518222

Although I have some qualms about Material UI designs (why does it lag when I press ON and OFF? why does it look and feel like dreamy cotton candy world?), the UX has gotten considerably good on the Android due to faster and cheaper phones. However, I do agree that Jobs absolutely nailed it with UX and focus on that area (much like how luxury car brands focus on the little things).<p>My answer to your exercise is that Tim Cook indeed tried to duplicate the same formula to a new device. Some problems are that there is such a small screen real estate, the UX would need a different approach. Another is market fit for the demographic that are into luxury. Would wearing the apple watch make you look cheap and &quot;techie&quot; or send other unintentional messages about you? The people who wear watch these days seems to be those that wants to flaunt their 100k Rolex or older generation. I remember people stopped wearing watches when cell phones displayed time, (I never wore one, I relied on my internal clock), an entire generation might have never wore a watch before, could the apple watch end up like the iPad where people first buy it out of curiosity and nobody bothers with it afterwards? Who knows but Apple will have enough cash to screw up several times now (if they do reach trillion dollar market cap). If Tim does make the Apple Watch a success, it would be huge for Apple.

The type of tag (i.e. fly, mosquito, tick) will show up when scanned.&quot; This is demonstrably a blatant lie. The card, when swiped, will, on standard credit card readers, throw a card read error. The FAQ continues: &quot;If there is no name, then the shoo!TAG® tag has lost its efficacy.&quot; What this means in effect, is that anyone who doesn&#x27;t know better will swipe the card and assume their card has expired. It seems self-evident that the manufacturers of ShooTag would not find such a test desirable, in any case. As most people know, credit cards will last for a lot longer than 4 months, the stated maximum period of effectiveness of the ShooTag. In addition to this, the ShooTag patent application explicitly says that &quot;…the trivector data stored on the three tracks (of the tag&#x27;s magnetic strip) is not readable by a conventional credit card reader.&quot;[8][28]",1437517498

9926297,comment,9925440,9926163,0,0,pcwalton,,,"Heavily related to this, one key insight that I think has been neglected is that JavaScript benchmarks do a bad job of measuring cold code. Most code on the Web is cold, because much Web browsing consists of fresh page loads. Heavily optimizing JITs are exactly what you <i>don&#x27;t</i> want for cold code: time spent compiling is time you could have been spending running the code. But benchmarks consist of running the same code repeatedly in a long-running loop, which encourages development of sophisticated, highly-optimizing JITs that spend a lot of time in up-front compilation, which end up being totally pointless for JS whose sole purpose is to run once to place an ad somewhere on the page.<p>It&#x27;s easy to forget that JavaScript is still primarily a scripting language used to perform high-level application tasks. It&#x27;s awesome that JS has gone so far low-level, and we should continue to push it as far as it can, but I think the bread and butter that users care about is not so much heavy number crunching but rather quick cold code that needs to run once or twice and get out of the way.",1437517486

This is like when the railroads&#x27; lunch was eaten by the tractor trailer because the railroads thought they were rail companies, when in fact they were transportation companies. Samsung and all the other competitors think they&#x27;re in the device business, but they&#x27;re not. They&#x27;re in the UX business.<p>It helps to have Steve Jobs, who was actually a user experience zealot and in a normal org would have been the CUXO, masquerading as a CEO. As an example, think of the difference between being an Apple vs. Samsung customer, all the way through the value chain. Shopping in that beautiful airy Apple store, experiencing those matte textures and ingenious packaging while unboxing your new devices, the industrial design wizardry that constructed a machine with such amazing fit and finish and tight panel gaps and textures, software that (sometimes, mostly) just works.<p>Jobs was a strong enough leader to make a bunch of mostly-orthogonal disciplines (e.g. manufacturing, industrial design, software engineering, packaging design) subservient to the company&#x27;s ultimate objective, which is UX. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that Apple tends to execute best-in-class on each of these axes, but that&#x27;s tactics not strategy.<p>The big question for the future is whether Tim Cook understands this. It&#x27;s left as an exercise for the reader whether the Apple watch is a product made by a UX company or by a company intent on duplicating the financial success of the ipad and iphone by cargo-culting the &quot;create new device class&quot; methods that worked before.",1437516812

This is universal and almost certainly evolved over the course of our million-year-long dance of mate competition and selection.<p>Since social rules are fairly arbitrary (which we know because they vary so much) there are bound to be situations where it is useful to be able to signal we are moving outside them. Taboo words serve that function very efficiently.<p>This is a bit different from saying &quot;We are hardwired to have taboo words&quot;, but it does show there are perfectly sensible ways to think about hardwiring in this regard, and it&#x27;s a bit tricky to get away from.<p>One way of testing this hypothesis would be to look at the distribution of taboo words as a function of the strength and complexity of social hierarchies. I would predict that strongly hierarchical societies with more social restrictions would tend to have more taboo words and likely a finer grading of taboo words than more relaxed societies. On the other hand, if we are more directly hardwired to have taboo words, there would be no reason for the number or gradation to vary across different societies.",1437516650

Guy purchasing M5 for his daily driver and an M class for his wife isn&#x27;t probably looking to drive it for the next 20 years vs. a single mom purchasing a van will be driving it for the next decade or so.<p>Market saturation calls for distinguishing yourself, and it&#x27;s tougher to do this in the lower end market vs. luxury. Cars are everywhere, yet Ferrari & Lamborghini are constantly finding new customers in emerging markets. This hasn&#x27;t been easy for the rest who are fighting each other over the average joe. There are so many players on this level and stakes are high especially because the margins are thin. Failing to stay relevant will drive them out. Failing to deliver across the board will not suffice. One reason Hyundai has been so successful here is that they offer a lot more value for the price to the average driver. Today, the brand has improved, car has improved as American cars have. In fact, the industry has improved a great deal because people in this segment is very demanding but without the rewards of high margins a luxury or supercar producer might enjoy.<p>As your income grows, your taste begins to change, and luxury brands know this very well. Do you really need a button that gives you extra 200 HP on demand? Will embedding diamonds in your dashboard increase km/L? The typical questions a non-luxury buyer will ask won&#x27;t apply to those that demand the absolute best. One reason might be social hierarchial reasons, if you were a hedge fund manager and you were golfing with your other hedge fund buddies equally looking to impress clients and sell image of success, an Acura isn&#x27;t just going to cut it.",1437516181

Fred types in some code, tries it, and it seems to work. Fred types in some more code, tries it, and it still seems to work. After several weeks of coding this way, the program suddenly stops working, and after hours of trying to fix it, he still doesn’t know why. Fred may well spend a significant amount of time chasing this piece of code around without ever being able to fix it. No matter what he does, it just doesn’t ever seem to work right.<p>Fred doesn’t know why the code is failing because he didn’t know why it worked in the first place. It seemed to work, given the limited “testing” that Fred did, but that was just a coincidence. Buoyed by false confidence, Fred charged ahead into oblivion. Now, most intelligent people may know someone like Fred, but we know better. We don’t rely on coincidences—do we?<p>Sometimes we might.

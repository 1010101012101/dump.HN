6704209,comment,6701688,6702741,3,0,e12e,,,"I realize it&#x27;s a trade-off -- but I think having &quot;;&quot; as an alias for &quot;end&quot; (or vice-versa) is a pretty bad idea. I personally prefers python&#x27;s indentation-for-blocks syntax, but I understand why you want semantics to be decoupled from indentation. But when using explicit end-markers, I&#x27;d prefer to match them to the start, maybe even introducing some verboseness, like: end-case, end-if etc -- maybe taking it further and allow/demand naming of blocks:<p><pre><code>    check:
      4 + 5 is 9
      1 / 3 is 2 / 6
      9 - 3 is 6
      5 > 4 is true
    end 
</code></pre>
Then becomes, not wrapped in end-check, but:<p><pre><code>    check(arithmethic-test):
      4 + 5 is 9
      1 / 3 is 2 / 6
      9 - 3 is 6
      5 > 4 is true
    end(arithmethic-test)
</code></pre>
Or something similiar. This makes mis-matching &quot;end&quot;s (either typos or
artifacts from cut&#x27;n&#x27;paste coding) explicit errors that are easy to
spot, and identify.<p>It would add a lot of verbosity, of course. As for &quot;;&quot;/&quot;end&quot;, consider
(the presumably valid):<p><pre><code>    check:
      4 + 5 is 9
      1 / 3 is 2 / 6
      9 - 3 is 6
      5 > 4 is true
    ;
</code></pre>
That trailing &quot;;&quot; is going to trip someone up. Also consider
(cut&#x27;n&#x27;paste-with-quick-edit):<p><pre><code>    check:
      4 + 5 is 9
      1 / 3 is 2 / 6;
      9 - 3 is 6
      5 > 4 is true;

Comparing any Polish city to Warsaw economically will give the obvious same results on every aspect, but these cities are completely different breeds of horse. Krakow is more visually appealing and is loved for its historical and cultural value, and a kind of bohemian vibe. Business has boomed significantly during the last decade down there and it&#x27;s getting more attractive. I&#x27;ve heard it faces serious pollution problems, and in some areas crime is more significant than in Warsaw (which in general is a pretty safe place). When it comes to &#x27;big city life&#x27;, making money and riding on the fast lane in the land of opportunities, Warsaw is considered that place (saying it&#x27;s the NY of Poland would be a bit of a stretch, but you get my point). As for the general vibe, Warsaw is the kind of big city you love or hate with a passion, there is no middle ground. You need to learn it and it will be for you what you want it to be. So, whether you&#x27;re more happy here or there depends on what you are really looking for.<p>For cheaper city alternatives, I&#x27;ve heard a lot of positives about Wroclaw, but I honestly don&#x27;t know much about it.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m locally patriotic, but that said I sincerely believe Warsaw is the place to be, YMMV.",1384040681

The list seems reasonable for the most part, though.<p>Aside from obvious questions about the kinds of projects you&#x27;d be working on and the skills and technologies involved, I used to rely on a few simple tests:<p>1. What is the employee turnover like, and if people have left recently, why? [This is a reasonably objective proxy for what the rank and file staff really think, and they collectively know this potential employer <i>much</i> better than me.]<p>2. Did they ask brain teaser type questions or do a pop-psych personality test in the interview? [Do their hiring practices suck, in which case even if they hired me, would I want to work with anyone else they hired? Also tends to indicate an unhealthy assumption of superiority and desire to conduct one-sided interviews, which is a red flag in its own right.]<p>3. Will they show me a sample of their production code and of the related documentation, and if so, what is it like? [If they won&#x27;t and don&#x27;t have a very good reason, my assumption is that they aren&#x27;t confident their code will impress, which is not a good sign. If they will, what I see is about as good a marker for whether they&#x27;re any good technically as any benchmark you can fit into an interview.]<p>4. What does the car park look like on the way in? [Far from scientific, but a handful of executive cars in reserved spaces and then nothing but old models in the few remaining spaces is rarely a good sign.]<p>5. Does the contract impose on my life outside of work? For example, would I need permission from the employer to take on an unrelated side job that had no bearing on my ability to work properly for them? Would they be claiming IP rights to any work I did unrelated to that employment, so that for example I couldn&#x27;t release a hobby project as Open Source if I wanted to?

Similar situation to the blog post -- a pickup truck cleared it but I did not. I was not in a safe position to swerve.<p>The tire chewed up the lower front bumper and punctured the radiator. I had to immediately pull over and have the car towed. It happened to hit below the foam & all the fancy crash reinforcement on the bumper. Good times.<p>That was just 70lbs of steel-wrapped rubber.

With Ansible, you do not have to draw or understand any freaking graphs of dependency and the only logic is the order of tasks you list them in yaml files and the order of how you include yaml files in runbooks.  I think that a first grade student will easily be able to understand the order of how tasks are going to be executed.  In comparison to Puppet, in order to achieve the right order of executions you will need to write all these require and what not.  At the end of the days, a lot of people are going to be so mad at themselves because puppet fails them in the best possible ways.<p>Don&#x27;t dismiss something too quickly as poor man&#x27;s puppet solution where Ansible users are laughing to the banks because we save tons of times with Ansible and finish our works in PREDICTABLE fashions 100% of the times with little sweat.  You can go ahead and spend all your times with your fancy graphs of dependency and write puppet modules that you and only you will understand.  We, Ansible users, will not face with such problems because a new or veteran Ansible user will be able to understand the exact same things as how the automation of our tasks will be.<p>And I do not know if puppet&#x27;s documentation is the problem or not and I do not think that is the case.  There have been plenty books and articles written about puppet and people should be able to read them and become better at that.  I personally bought 2 books on Puppet, read ways to many articles written on the web about puppet and at the end of the day it is not only because of the DSL, dependency nightmares, complexity in getting a master/slave environment up but because puppet has tried to make something better but on the other hands make other things way more too complicated than needed.<p>Poor you my friend for only seeing one tree in a forest. I know that a lot of people are reluctant to change because they have invested heavily in the times, money, efforts in something like puppet and they simply do not want to give puppet up.  It all boils down to whether you ask yourself if you could do something better and question the norms.  It does not mean that something has been around for many years is the best thing and it does not mean because you use it I have to use it too.

So for example, we get more annoyed about police undercover spies having sex under false pretences, than about the fact that there were police undercover spies in peaceful protest groups (despite the fact that is clearly egregious overkill and bad for democracy).",1384039752

This law is being actively taught, checked during the driver test, and enforced.<p>In Poland, a similar law was passed only 2 years ago. Driving a bicycle in Poland is considered more dangerous than driving one in Germany - cycle trip guides (that run through both countries) specifically mention that one should be much more careful around crossings and cars turning right in Poland.<p>Berlin, where I live, is quite close to Poland, so there are often polish drivers around. I&#x27;m careful in general, because there are enough inattentive German drivers... but once they&#x27;ve seen me because they&#x27;ve overtaken me, they will make sure not to run me over. Polish drivers, on the other hand, expect that the cyclist will give way in certain situations (i.e. they make a right turn across a bike lane) - because they have learned it that way in driving school and it works this way in their home country. Luckily, it always worked out, but I had several very close encounters with Polish drivers.<p>So, yes, having and enforcing laws to protect cyclists do help and increase safety.<p>(I may add that I don&#x27;t hold a grudge against Polish people - in fact, most I&#x27;ve met are more easy going and less grumpy than the average German :-) I&#x27;m glad they passed this law recently and I&#x27;m sure the situation will improve in the long term).",1384039336

If you read the patent by downloading it online, there&#x27;s an electronic paper trail.

You? The issue under discussion is the safety of a Tesla versus other cars in similar circumstances. If I was evaluating the relative safety of cars while purchasing a car, a fire after a few minutes of striking a big piece of debris seems to be safer than major damage or loss of control(if that&#x27;s the case).<p>Whether an equivalent non-Tesla car would actually be more dangerous is certainly up for debate, but I don&#x27;t see anything insightful in your post.

6703956,comment,6703285,6703606,3,0,SkyMarshal,,,"Wearing a helmet is always better than not wearing one.  You never know what kind of accident you might be in.  Sure there are some a helmet may not protect you from, but there are plenty where a helmet will.  It&#x27;s a stupid, pointless risk not to take such an easy precaution to reduce your odds of permanent brain injury.<p>Case in point, a few years I was on the home stretch of a 50 mile weekend bikeride, less than a mile from home.  I was tired, dehydrated, and fuzzy-brained, but still alert enough to be paying close attention to the traffic around me.  I was riding ~10-15mph in the far left lane of one-way 4-lane primary thoroughfare (35mph speed limit).<p>4-way intersection ahead, figured I&#x27;d cross the intersection and ride up onto the very wide sidewalk on the far side so I could get out of traffic, slow to a crawl, relax, and take it easy the rest of the way home.  As I came up to the intersection I angled slightly toward the sidewalk ramp on the other side, then turned my head around to the right to watch the traffic coming up behind me to make sure no car was going to make a left turn at the intersection and either turn into me or cut me off.<p>All clear with cars, no left turners, but when I looked ahead again I saw I&#x27;d miss-judged my path and was going to miss the on-ramp by about 5ft and hit the nearly 1ft-high curb instead.  Going too fast to correct course and hit the ramp, or to slam on the breaks and stop, only thing I could do was try jump the bike, or at least the front wheel, over the curb.<p>Too tired, botched the maneuver, not quite high enough, front wheel hit the curb about halfway up and went from around 10-12mph to 0 in a millisecond.  Of course me and the rest of the bike kept going, me slingshotting over the handlebars (bike shoes clipped in so angular momentum at work here) and then piledriven head first into the concrete sidewalk.  My head landed first with a loud crack, then my body landed on my head, then the bike on top of my body.<p>I might have been out for a few seconds, not sure, but the first thing I remember was thinking, &quot;ok don&#x27;t move a muscle, just lay perfectly till, you might have just broken your back and even the slightest movement could cause a tear in your spinal cord.&quot;  Slowly, gradually, tentatively I started testing that individual fingers and toes worked, then hands and feet, then arms and legs, and finally body and neck.<p>Everything was ok, but I was still lying there not daring to try to get up.  Next thought was, &quot;ok, that loud crack was my head hitting the concrete, I probably have a concussion.  gotta be careful, don&#x27;t black out.&quot;  Reached up to my head, started feeling around.  Helmet broken in places, totalled as designed, but still attached, strapped on, conformed to my head.<p>Still lying on the sidewalk with bike on top of me, afraid of further injury, and feeling around my head checking for injury.  No blood, no pain anywhere.  Disbelief.  Check again, thoroughly.  Still no blood, no pain.  More disbelief.<p>Can I really have just had a crash that bad, where my head alone absorbed the entire impact of my 200lb self and ~20lb bike, without any injury besides skinned hands and some bruises?  Mindbogglingly, yes that was exactly what happened.  That helmet absorbed the whole damn thing, and I walked away without either a concussion or any kind of neck or spinal injury, just some scrapes and bruises.<p>So yeah, just wear a helmet.  Even if you have 10 accidents where a helmet is irrelevant and just 1 where it is, it will have been worth it.<p>If my anecdotal evidence doesn&#x27;t impress you, then think of it terms of Expected Payoff E(X).  Wearing a helmet costs nothing of consequence, yet the benefits could range from 0 (you&#x27;re never in a crash your entire life and never need it, or you&#x27;re in a crash where a helmet makes absolutely no difference) to everything (you&#x27;re in a crash that would cause permanent brain damage or death without a helmet protection).  You can see how the averages work out.<p>Humans are very poor by default at evaluating risks that have low odds of occurring, but very high consequences if they do occur.  Bike crashes are exactly this kind of risk, so don&#x27;t be a typical human here - don&#x27;t blow these types of risks off, discount them, or ignore them.  Be smart, mitigate or neutralize them.",1384038443

Double-blind studies often showed little correlation between MSG and adverse symptoms. Parties on both sides of the debate slung accusations at the other, with the anti-MSG researchers claiming that studies were being funded by MSG producers, and pro-MSG researchers accusing the other side of fear-mongering.<p>From the FDA to the United Nations to various governments (Australia, Britain and Japan) the public bodies that have investigated MSG have deemed it a safe food additive. The FDA states on their website:<p>FDA considers the addition of MSG to foods to be generally recognized as safe (GRAS). Although many people identify themselves as sensitive to MSG, in studies with such individuals given MSG or a placebo, scientists have not been able to consistently trigger reactions.<p>Scientific interest in its deleterious effects seems to be waning: one of the last studies to gain public attention was published in 2011. The authors of that study claimed to have found a link between MSG and obesity, though those results have been questioned. While the general scientific consensus seems to be that only in large doses and on an empty stomach can MSG temporarily affect a small subset of the population, MSGs reputation is still maligned in the public eye.&quot;<p>That last sentence is important.",1384038400

Great, until you have a crash that looks like these [0] and you have a bunch of people trying to help victims while walking around in a wet 400 Volt DC environment.<p>Now add more electric cars into the mix for a fun multi-electric car accident.  Would YOU walk into that on Elon&#x27;s recommendation?  I&#x27;ll tell you, I&#x27;ve been around high DC voltages, from a few hundred volts to tens of thousands.  Water while handling components?  No fucking way.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  I love electric cars and would have been in line to buy a Tesla SUV had they not pulled that bone-headed design stunt with the falcon wings.  At the same time I am a realist in that I understand that there&#x27;s much to be learned about having thousands of cars with fully charged multi-hundred-volt power systems sharing the road at the same time.  The emergency manual says that the pack can easily re-ignite and that it should be under observation for at least 24 hours.  That&#x27;s one of the issues with electrics.  You can secure a gasoline powered car by simply draining all of the gasoline and dealing with it chemically.  Imagine an electric car catching fire again as it is being towed away on top of a flatbed truck.  We are going to have to develop new approaches to all of this.

6703945,comment,6702790,6703203,3,0,amscanne,,,"> I really do not like these articles that say &quot;science says not to worry, you must be a very stupid and uneducated person to be worried about this.&quot; Any honest scientist will tell you that science does not know exactly how the human body processes food and there is no model which will exactly predict the effects of the human body ingesting a certain food.<p>It&#x27;s true that we have a <i>very</i> limited understanding of the human body.<p>But this is the whole point. Unless there&#x27;s some science to back something (or you have some personal experiences) then it&#x27;s irrational to change your behaviour. [Note that I&#x27;m certainly not discounting personal experience here. Because the body is complicated, I think that&#x27;s worth <i>more</i> than science. But you&#x27;ve got to be careful about your biases.]<p>The example of trans fats is an interesting one. AFAIK, the science (early 90s?) predated anyone seriously changing behaviour or policy. Although people suggested a connection earlier, it would not have been reasonable to start altering the entire food industry around some unsubstantiated claims. There are random connections suggested all the time. Unfortunately, they are only insightful in retrospect and no one remembers the ones that didn&#x27;t turn out to be true.<p>> So I am very very suspicious of any food additives. The only rational decision for a human being is to eat the type of foods humans have eaten for tens of thousands of years before and for which our bodies have evolved.<p>While it&#x27;s sane to be suspicious of food additives, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s rational to go back ten of thousands of years. Modern humans live <i>much</i> longer and are healthier than humans ten thousand years ago. There are plenty of modern additives about which there is little to no debate:
* Iodine added to salt.
* Vitamins A and D added to milk in Northern countries (incl. USA and Canada).
* Fluoride added to tap water.
I&#x27;m sure there are many other additives that are generally accepted as good, but I&#x27;m not aware of. And aside from additives, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want my food to stop being pasteurized...<p>> MSG is especially worrying because there are some studies that show negative effects of MSG and the fact that other studies show no effects does not quite negate these.<p>IIRC, the studies that showed negative effects were done by injecting MSG directly into rats. I believe the consensus is that the ingestion of glutamate is much different than direct injection. You consume glutamate every day in your food (I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of things you eat which would do very bad things if injected directly into your blood). I don&#x27;t think anyone has the view that studies are negated because they are contradicted by others, but they are frequently negated due to poor protocols or new information.<p>I actually don&#x27;t find MSG very worrying because it seems to be a cultural phenomenon, more than a scientific one. (There are many: third-hand smoking, resveratrol, anti-oxidants, etc. Not to say there&#x27;s no science there, just that the cultural view is only tangentially related to the science. It&#x27;s like our fan death.)<p>I went through my own little discovery: A few years ago, I was shocked to discover that a girl I was dating frequently cooked with an MSG sauce (she was from Mexico). Stunned, I researched the whole MSG thing. Turns out it&#x27;s quite popular all over the world, except in english-speaking countries. The popular demonization stemmed from a few poorly-done studies that very quickly become part of the zeitgeist (it&#x27;s suggested that this was partly due to racism/xenophobia since it was seen as an asian thing). And despite its widespread use for decades, there&#x27;s no real evidence that suggests what people fear about it. And because of the fear, it&#x27;s actually one of the most-tested of all food ingredients and yet it remains legal to sell and use as an additive everywhere.<p>> Furthermore, I myself feel negative effects when eating certain foods that I suspect of containing MSG.<p>One last quick point --
I don&#x27;t think you should treat your own experience as the addendum. As you suggested, the human body is a complex system so I think the best thing that you can do is listen to your instincts. [Of course, you should also try to keep in mind the psychology at play. You feel bad, so you suspect the food has MSG; or you suspect the food has MSG, so you feel bad.]",1384038322

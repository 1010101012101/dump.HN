99035,comment,98734,98734,0,0,jsnx,,,"In Zen, it is said that ""aggregates"" (things) have no ""self nature"", that all things arise in ""codependent origination"" -- you can't get a driver in a universe without cars, nor a car without drivers. One seeks not the ""car-ness"" in cars, but their context. The ""seeing as"" notion amounts to the same rejection of Platonic ideals.",1200452083

Online recommendation systems particularly... they suck!<p>But more importantly, even if someone developed a ""perfect"" recommendation system, what would that be worth? For example, it has been said that symmetric encryption is good enough today that even if the perfect (could only be beaten via bruit force) algorithm was created , nothing would change.<p>Are we facing the same problem in this field? Or are those implementing these systems today just neglecting to take the field to the next level?",1200451300

99028,comment,98757,98810,0,0,marketer,,,"I made quite a few assumptions - namely that mortgage banks are huge players in the various mortgage markets, and because Paulson extracted billions of dollars from these markets, the banks lost money as well.

99015,comment,98757,98950,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"I misunderstood you. My apologies. I was under the impression from other interviews in the book that Schwager followed the same strategy.<p>The thing is, trading can't be the only successful way to make money, or even more successful than other traders on average -- because trading implies buying more as the market confirms your views, and if that's profitable, it implies that traders will own all the world's assets, and every asset will either rise infinitely or collapse to zero.<p>If it helps, you could think of him as an arbitrageur betting that the mortgage market would converge with reality. That thesis relies on believing that the market misprices assets, so it seems that further mispricing would confirm it rather than belie it.",1200449364

99011,comment,98686,98686,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>""... When you evolve out of start-up mode and start worrying about being professional and dignified, you only lose capabilities. You don't add anything... you only take away. Dignity is deadly. ...""</i><p>This is the crux of the article. If you have to get dressed up and wear a <i>""suit""</i>, it doesn't make your software better. If you subscribe to the latest theory of ""<i>foo</i>"" because the ""<i>bar</i>"" association thinks it's good, it wont help you get more customers. The ideals of Professionalism and Profession are a mismatch for the Startup world.<p>The creation process in Startups is new markets, products and services. Not old ones.  In fact, the best are trying to displace the old entirely. Put them out of business and make them extinct. It's messy, full of unexpected stops and starts. Not the calm, orderly and mastered process with known results as the ideals of Professionalism enshrine.<p>Professionalism has its place where the benefit of improvement has to be weighed with the risk of damage to the old and existing. An insurance policy against risk but a barrier to innovation.<p><i>""... Living only on take-out and caffeine. Working in a [small] living room. Crazy, stupid, unprofessional behavior. Wearing nothing but shorts and ripped t-shirts ...""</i><p>I love this quote. It neatly sums up the informality of the startup process and something people from more structured backgrounds have trouble grokking. At least it's another excuse get around in shorts + t-shirt, think and code up ideas rather than waste money on clothes.",1200448870

7151685,comment,7150645,7151477,2,0,robmcm,,,"You have highlighted the good parts about using singletons. Now say your application wanted to play two different music streams (lets pretend you added a mix feature), you are now stumped.<p>I first ran into the pain of singletons when using them in a framework. This framework formed the bases for small modules, which when loaded together into the same application domain blew up.<p>My solution was to use IOC/DI. I could still have singletons , but they are just instanced managed by the container. This mean I am not relying on static values for state, which in my view is as bad as global variables.<p>I guess this is really the problem most people associate with the singleton model, not that there is a single instance in your application, but that typically people use static variables to store the instance.",1391101194

That is the true &quot;Singleton pattern&quot; - a class that combines two concerns, 1) the behavior of the class and 2) the instantiation pattern of the class.",1391101183
7151683,comment,7150692,7150692,9,0,nine_k,,,"At Yandex (Russia&#x27;s largest search engine) among engineers they/we used to have a motto: &quot;I am non-representational&quot; (&quot;я не репрезентативен&quot;), reminding about just that. Another useful motto was &quot;I&#x27;m not your target audience&quot;. Some even had these on T-shirts.<p>You, the developer, are not a normal user, by definition (unless you&#x27;re building tools for fellow developers). Anything user-facing should be tested on real users, on members of the target audience. What they find convenient and useful may seem inconvenient and useless to you. This is OK; such a view is usually reciprocal.<p>BTW this is often a point of contention in open-source software. It is built mostly by engineers. If the target audience does not also consist of engineers, users may find the UI confusing and inconvenient, despite authors&#x27; best effort to make it clear and convenient <i>for themselves</i>.",1391101171

The fact that he did not do that indicates that he thought less people would read it if they knew it was an advertisement right from the start. So then the author thought he would have to trick people if he wanted to get them to read the advertisement, so he sneaked it in at the end. This intent to deceive is what I am calling unethical. Now, sure this could be an effective technique, but the kind of deceit and trickery usually involved in such marketing leaves me with a bad taste.",1391101167

7151660,comment,7150645,7151477,6,0,jarrett,,,"> But these are all very convoluted compared to having a single class-method in the class itself which returns a shared (static) object.<p>I used to think the same thing. But lately, I&#x27;ve come to think it&#x27;s better for code to explicitly reveal its dependencies via its public API. If class Foo uses the singleton class Bar, you can&#x27;t see that dependency just by looking at Foo&#x27;s API.<p>My preferred solution in OOP is either: a) have Foo&#x27;s constructor accept a reference to an instance of Bar, or b) for any method on Foo that requires a Bar, have that method accept a reference to an instance of Bar. I find this disciplined approach helps me reason about my code and understand how units of code relate to each other.<p>I only developed this insight after diving into functional programming. Prior to that, I was all about convenience. Singletons were convenient, and I didn&#x27;t want to pass a references around all the time. It seemed like a lot of pointless ceremony. Now I&#x27;ve changed my tune. Rather than pointless ceremony, it&#x27;s a form of self-documentation.",1391100971

7151613,comment,7150645,7150645,2,0,msluyter,,,"Having used Spring for a year or so now, I&#x27;m curious what people think of singletons in Spring? Most of the problems noted in the OP (inability to use interfaces, unable to mock, tight coupling, etc...) aren&#x27;t really problems that I&#x27;ve noticed. For example, if you&#x27;re autowiring a typical spring bean, as in:<p><pre><code>    @Autowired\n    private Blah blah;\n</code></pre>\nYou can actually autowire an interface here. Similarly, it&#x27;s pretty easy to mock these or swap them out in tests. Parallelization is usually handled by not storing private state in a singleton bean.<p>I&#x27;m no Spring expert, so I&#x27;m not sure what I may be missing, but most of these concerns appear to be less problematic than many suggest.[1]<p>[1] Nothing is perfect, of course. I have noticed problems with spring singletons where a test would basically screw up the application context, causing subsequent tests to fail. This caused some hair pulling until I learned about @DirtiesContext.",1391100526

But these are all very convoluted compared to having a single class-method in the class itself which returns a shared (static) object.<p>The only caveat is to make sure that you don&#x27;t introduce race conditions by poor design. For example, don&#x27;t do stuff in -init on your singleton, and especially don&#x27;t do stuff that might call other stuff that might access the singleton via the public accessor. Doing so could turn into an infinite loop if -init is called when creating the singleton. (I&#x27;ve done this before.) Instead, just add a new -setup method and call that somewhere in -applicationDidFinishLaunching: or whatever. It&#x27;s also a good idea to use dispatch_once to create the singleton[2].<p>EDIT: Of course, these suggestions don&#x27;t only apply to Objective-C apps, although your entry points and race-condition-avoiding functions will certainly be different in other environments.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/sdegutis/bahamut"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sdegutis/bahamut</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/sdegutis/bahamut/blob/master/Bahamut/SDMusicPlayer.m#L44-L51"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sdegutis/bahamut/blob/master/Bahamut/SDMu...</a>",1391099085

Yes it is mostly syntactic sugar, where I wanted to make a point is that this &quot;sugar&quot; adds more to the language than sweetness for the sake of it. It exposes beautiful pattern that are cluttered in day to day javascript syntax. My final compiled javascript code is not the same I would have produced would I have coded directly in Javascript. Coffeescript also gives me a different approach to think about a problem.<p>> Things like it&#x27;s expressive for loops and default arguments generate really ugly code, and shun people from using ES5 array methods like .forEach, .map, and .filter, which are a lot cleaner and more optimizable by the engine.<p>I use underscore which will delegate to .forEach et all it they exist... I really rarely use loop comprehension, though they can be very expressive if used correctly..<p>> CoffeeScript will completely obscure the way JavaScript works to newcomers<p>I disagree. I&#x27;ve installed the proper plugin (I&#x27;m on emacs, same is true for vim, sublime or lightTable), I am therefore two stroke away from the compiled javascript. Furthermore, I spent a decent amount of time a week in the debugger where the code is in JS. If I could have disliked this in the beginning, having two different languages whether you code or debug can seem unfamiliar, I actually love it. It keeps my Javascript sharpen and it gives a thorough understanding of exactly what&#x27;s happening in my Coffeescript code. And that&#x27;s exactly where I found a niche for Coffeescript. In my opinion, it is definitely not a replacement for Javascript, it is a cleaner, more expressive and easier way to write it, without any real overhead. Honestly, it took me minutes to understand and less than a day to feel comfortable and be efficient in Coffeescript. What I recommend to newcomers is to use coffeescript&#x27;s syntax to to learn Javascript, by continually compiling down to JS and understanding what&#x27;s happening. The JS output by CS isn&#x27;t ugly at all, and that is a strong point. It is really possible to learn some great javascript idoms just by applying built-in coffeescript construct and understanding their value and working in JS<p>> JavaScript isn&#x27;t designed to have true OOP principles<p>...

How will they find out about it? This is getting pretty close to advertising... but the least-scummy way to do it is rely on word-of-mouth. This is actually how people find out about stuff in general. You can assist this process by just articulating just what it is you have, and what problem it solves, in a pithy, easy-to-remember, easy-to-pass-on phrase. You might have a little story (or joke) that helps carry it along. But the non-scummy part about this is that people problem won&#x27;t pass it on if they don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any good.

Even having a free version in the first place is an aspect of marketing.<p>Finally, consider the problems of a charity, whose only goal is to help people. What help is needed?

I don&#x27;t feel happy about nudging a girl or a boy to learn a skill that&#x27;s professional in its nature.<p>I still believe it&#x27;s delusional to see programming as just an interest and something people need even if they&#x27;re not programmers. We&#x27;ll do to programming the same we did to math: people spend years being taught math but come out unable to do basic algebra, and forever scared of it.<p>Children turn into rebellious teenagers. I wasn&#x27;t a very rebellious teenager, but I remember not doing things that would actually be good for me in the long term just out of spite for some authority figures.

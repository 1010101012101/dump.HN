How about if OpenWrt was running on a hypervisor? It&#x27;d have to be small enough to fit in the EEPROM constraints, which probably rules out Xen, but KVM could work.<p>With a hypervisor in place, you could install an image alongside a working one, then do a warm reboot to start the new image. The user would be presented with a website to confirm that they&#x27;d like to keep this new image. If the user doesn&#x27;t confirm this within a fixed time period, the router would roll back to the old image.<p>As for the space requirements for keeping two images on the router, I wonder if anything could be done there. For example, I wonder if the new image could be applied as a &#x27;patch&#x27; on top of the old one, stored as file diffs rather than as a standalone image. Does that sound workable?",1452329689

When you grok a <i>language</i>, that doesn&#x27;t (just) mean you now understand how to <i>use</i> the language; it means you now understand how to <i>extend</i> the language, or <i>update</i> the language, in a way the original designers would have done themselves if they had continued working on it.<p>To grok C and Unix, is to put yourself into a mindset where you would naturally come up with Go and Plan 9; and where e.g. C++ would seem, in comparison, ridiculous.<p>Grokking a thing doesn&#x27;t mean you have to <i>agree</i> with the mindset of its designers; it just means you have to be capable of <i>wielding</i> that mindset, because it&#x27;s the optimal mindset for understanding the thing itself.<p>The interesting thing about grokking a system is that you no longer <i>need</i> to attempt to &quot;understand&quot; the system piece-wise, because you can now <i>guess</i> what the designer would have provided for the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve, and then just blindly &quot;reach for it&quot; without having to know it exists. There are quite a few times I guessed the existence of a Unix utility without having to be told about it, simply because it &#x27;fit&#x27; the Unix philosophy to have a program with that function exist.<p>Instead of the lego analogy, I might go with IKEA: build enough of their furniture, and you don&#x27;t have to read the manuals to put together new pieces any more. When you survey the particular parts you got out of the box, you can guess pretty accurately what the manual is going to say.",1452329176

In that case, I agree that (but see caveat below).<p>But there are many other forms of financial advisers. A good adviser can help you to diversify your investments, help you to mitigate and control tax liability, help you match your risk profile to investments, etc. These are valuable things that the average person cannot do on their own, and they <i>are</i> worth paying for.<p>Note: A caveat to the &#x27;don&#x27;t use advisers&#x27; approach. I generally believe in a relatively efficient market, although I think you <i>can</i> get higher returns in some situations (e.g. some hedge funds <i>do</i> appear to get higher returns).<p>However, even if I didn&#x27;t, sometimes it is worth paying for an financial trader to work on your behalf, for the same reasons as above, namely, you&#x27;d like to invest a bulk of money, but aren&#x27;t sure how best to invest it and want to diversify. As much as the advice fits on an index card, it&#x27;s still a complicated and technical field.

It&#x27;s to the lottery&#x27;s benefit. Two reasons:<p>1) People are attached to &quot;their&quot; numbers, and would be very upset if you didn&#x27;t let them pick exactly the ones they want. Alienated players equals lower participation.<p>2) There are more overlaps when people pick than when the computer picks. Which means that, each drawing, there is a lower probability of someone hitting the jackpot than if all numbers are distinct. Which means the money rolls over and the next drawing has a larger prize.

You&#x27;ll never look back.   I love OpenWRT but a $100 Netgear or Linksys device just can&#x27;t touch a real PC motherboard with Intel NICs.<p>My preferred pfSense platform at both home and the office is a server-grade chassis running ESXi.  My router runs in a VM on this server and I use vSwitches to connect the VM to the various ports on the 4-port Intel NIC.<p>I just built it like this for convenience (I already had the ESXi server) but I later found a side-benefit: if you&#x27;ve set up a DMZ on pfSense, you can easily attach VMs to the DMZ by associating them with the DMZ vSwitch.  So, I have some untrusted VMs sitting in my DMZ and trusted VMs sitting on my LAN...all on the same piece of hardware.<p>I&#x27;ve been running this way since 2013 and it&#x27;s been flawless and fast.

Most laptops only have 2, but even so the signal quality will be much better wih a 3- or 4- way MIMO setup on the AP end. (The D-Link has 6 antennas, so 3-way MIMO for both 5GHz and 2.4.) In addition to number of antennas, orientation also makes a big difference.<p>Finally, wireless access points seem to be one of those things where quality varies a lot.

10870498,comment,10867056,10868876,0,0,teekert,,,"So you are saying, all human beings somehow are responsible for the happiness (we didn&#x27;t define what they are responsible for but I&#x27;ll assume happiness/well being) of all others? Where do you draw the line? Why are you not giving more of your salary to poor people? Who determines what is enough giving? Can I hold you responsible? Or, who can? Or do you perhaps I agree that you may feel responsible but you can&#x27;t be held responsible... In which case your <i>are</i> not responsible (claiming one <i>is</i> responsible for others is the statement I originally responded to). One can <i>take</i> responsibility for the well being of other, this can feel good. One does not <i>have</i> this responsibility implicitly. Or at least I strongly believe one should not.<p>Example: What is a more desirable situation?<p>A persons taking responsibility for a child out of a deep feeling that it is good of a person feeling forced into taking care of a child because of cultural pressures? (Arguably) The child of person 2 is better off when someone is found that feels natural responsibility for him/her.<p>Luckily most parents feel strong responsibility for the well being of their offspring. For those that don&#x27;t, we have adoption agencies and other methods to help. Generally our society believes it to be more moral that people can give their child away than to force them into a responsibility they don&#x27;t want (or know they can&#x27;t handle). So we already believe, even for our own children, that responsibility is yours to take, not something you have by default and needs to be forced upon you. Forced responsibility is not love, it is anti-love, it will lead to sick relationships.<p>So to come back to the original post: Being adults is about <i>taking</i> responsibility, not about complying to some culture enforce role model that <i>is</i> responsible for others. You can not be forced into taking responsibility (meaning you don&#x27;t somehow <i>have</i> it) but if you don&#x27;t take it, you&#x27;ll end up nowhere (you&#x27;ll be a homeless person or in jail.)",1452326632

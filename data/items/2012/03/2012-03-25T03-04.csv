Teachers follow the same distribution of personalities as any other occupation on this planet; some are good, some are bad, most are average.</i><p>In my experience there are precious few teachers who don't teach at all. In fact, I never had a single one that bad. At worst, they hand you the text book and make you read it over the course of the year and give you some tests on it.<p>The <i>best</i> teachers don't teach much really. Rather they <i>inspire</i>. The worst teachers may teach a lot, but they make you despise the material.<p>It seems to me that having teachers be forced to teach to standardized tests will kill off the first type of teacher, while having little or no effect on the second kind of teacher.<p>The worst of all worlds.",1332647980
3751670,comment,3748401,3749114,2,0,spamizbad,,,"> They also help, by identifying bad teachers and bad schools.<p>Not really.  Here in Chicago, the Noble charter high schools will often teach directly to the ACT.  This results in some dramatic boosting of ACT scores, with some schools taking kids from the dysfunctional CPS System and getting a school average of 23.  Unfortunately, once they reach college, they  see little academic success despite being straight-A students with 25+ ACT scores.<p>This has a detrimental impact on the curriculum:<p>1) The English program structured heavily around basic reading comprehension, with little to no emphasis on writing composition.  A students understanding of essay composition s roughly: ""Organize the things you want to talk about into paragraphs... then write a conclusion.""  However, to their credit, they're <i>really</i> good at reading test questions.<p>2) Math is focused on teaching Pre-algebra fundamentals and then layering on test-specific Algebra, Geometric (with that goofy proof system), and basic Trig.  It's a sad, narrow sample of our already sad & narrow HS math curriculum.  It covers few ""advanced"" Algebra and Trig subjects.  This means anyone who has to take ""college math"" will need courses in Trig and Precalc in college, with the possibility of an Algebra refresher course before proceeding.<p>3) Social Studies and Science?  All rote-to-test.  Students are drilled on step-by-step procedures on how to interpret graphs that'll score correctly on tests... without giving them actual knowledge on how to critically think about information - be it historical or scientific.<p>NCLB schools do the same song-and-dance, except with a much less rigorous test.  If you've actually seen the questions on most NCLB tests, you'd be disappointed.  Unfortunately, the composition of such tests is so political and messy it's impossible to provide any measure of quality.<p>You cannot assume testing will provide you accurate information or a better outcome for students.  If you're going to implement a testing regiment, you need to be very mindful of the Observer Effect:  You can very easily change the outcome by measuring it.  This is not an easy problem to solve.",1332647971

For instance I've painted every room in my house. My basement was only sealed when I moved in; it now resembles a construction site as I am partitioning it off into various rooms, adding walling, carpeting, electrical, so-on. This is <i>my</i> home and I make it the way <i>I</i> want to live. If one of my renters in my investment properties tried something like that, I'd wrap them up in destruction of property and violation of contract legal charges.<p>And there is one other HUGE incentive on owning your own home, it's YOURS. You won't get kicked out unless you don't pay the bills. I can not put into words the mental at-ease it puts when you know you own something, especially when that something is the roof over your head at night (That almost sounds consumerist doesn't it? lol). And before anyone commits to the fact that paying off a home takes 30 years, keep in mind it's like a credit card: if you pay the minimum payment, that's what you'll get.

3751615,comment,3750684,3751418,7,0,duaneb,,,"Penrose's <i>The Emperor's New Mind</i> addresses this idea. Basically, Penrose assumes that:<p>1. Gdel's Incompleteness Theorems are equivalent to the halting problem (provable)<p>2. If the human mind is deterministic, it can be modeled with a deterministic algorithm (provable).<p>3. The human mind seems to be capable of proving arbitrary things about all algorithms (debatable; I'm extremely skeptical).<p>4. Therefore, the human mind is not bound by the halting theorem, and therefore the human mind is not deterministic.<p>He then draws several possible speculations. 1, the human mind is driven by quantum mechanics. He explains this more in <i>Shadow of the Mind</i>, the ""sequel"" to this book, and goes on to postulate specifically that ""microtubules"" allow quantum mechanics to have far-reaching effects that are indistinguishable from consciousness. Other people, most notably and substantially Max Tegmark, disagree[1], arguing, ""we nd that the decoherence timescales (10^13 to 10^20 seconds) are typically much shorter than the relevant dynamical timescales (10^3 to 10^1 seconds),
both for regular neuron ring and for kink-like polarization
excitations in microtubules. This conclusion disagrees with
suggestions by Penrose and others that the brain acts as a
quantum computer, and that quantum coherence is related
to consciousness in a fundamental way."" Since then, quantum effects, especially quantum teleportation, appear to be crucial at the molecular level in processes like photosynthesis[2], suggesting that, perhaps, quantum mechanics may play a role.<p>However, even if quantum mechanics do play a role in human consciousness, I don't see how trading a deterministic brain for a random one is an improvement. Personally, I don't think that quantum mechanics do provide a crucial level to the extent that our brains are somehow not bound by logical axioms; I still believe there's a fundamental ""algorithm"" that drives the biological brain, though it may be difficult to conceive of, and I tend to agree with Tegmark in ideas of consciousness. Still, I'm open to any evidence on either side of the table, but I think we're a few decades away from key discoveries about the way our brains work that will shed any serious light on the subject.<p>-------------------------------------------------------------<p>[1]: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9907009"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9907009</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v446/n7137/abs/nature05678.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v446/n7137/abs/nature05...</a><p>Extra reading: see [wikipedia](<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orch-OR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orch-OR</a>)",1332646200

3751590,comment,3750817,3751510,4,0,j2labs,,,"> The main problem I see with gevent/eventlet is it has many of the weaknesses of callback and preemptive threaded code with none of the strengths.<p>It is intended to create an environment similar to preemptive threads, yet due to it being a networking library it is unlikely gevent users will have to use the semaphore and locking primitives provided with gevent.<p>Regarding the weaknesses of callbacks, I disagree and would like to see evidence supporting your case.<p>> - It can't use multiple cores, even if Python got the ability in the future, gevent code simply wouldn't work as intended.<p>This is pure speculation. If Python's multicore handling was better (existed?), it's likely gevent would be implemented similar to other systems where you have threads allocated to each core and the concurrency primitives can then be executed on cores according to some algorithm.<p>> - While gevent is not preemptive, context switches are implicit, that means you cannot write code without locks unless you want to do some handwaving. You have to know the entire system to know that a multistep operation that calls functions is actually safe.<p>While this is true, I don't think it is likely to occur. Gevent's creator agrees: <a href=""http://www.gevent.org/intro.html#cooperative-multitasking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gevent.org/intro.html#cooperative-multitasking</a><p>> On the net, gevent may be better than Twisted or Tornado, but I think that is saying more about how much those suck than how good gevent is.<p>You're an Erlang programmer.

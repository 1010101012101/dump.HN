But with PHP it's easier for newbies to grok things when you can just point a web server at a directory that has a ""blog.php"" file in it, and visit ""myserver.com/blog.php"" to execute that script and see results.

In the 1950s and earlier, a college degree of any kind would guarantee you a white-collar job. People with advanced educations, particularly in the soft subjects like English and History, were highly sought after and groomed to be managers and executives. Now you not only need a degree specific to the field you are attempting to enter, the degree only gets you into the entry level if you can even get the job because there are fewer jobs than there are degree-holders. If you do manage to get the job, wages have gone down relative to inflation and the cost of a university education has gone up, leading to more debt. College graduates today have fewer opportunities than high school graduates did a few decades ago and fewer opportunities than high school drop-outs had before the Depression, and are often making less money. Adjusted for inflation, my father made more as a bagger at a grocery store in the 1970s than I have ever made as a computer programmer, and that's when I can find work.<p>It's easy to say the problem is a lack of jobs, but it's harder to say what to do about it.",1332513911

Seriously, I remember the debates during the early 90s (back when MIPS and friends were going to destroy Intel) and the RISC of then is <i>very</i> different from the RISC of today. Then the merit of RISC was that you literally reduced the instruction set to the minimum possible, putting the demand on the compiler to gang them to do even rudimentary work. The idea was that the simpler silicon would be easier to scale up (frequency scaling was a major problem), and the compiler would have more insight into the operations of a product giving such a product a performance advantage.<p>The MIPS of the 90s had about 45 instructions, total, and a corresponding simplicity of implementation. The 8086 had 114, providing higher level, much more complex silicon, and has grown since then.<p>How many instructions does ARMv7a provide (this is actually a hard question to answer)? It has floating point operations, SIMD / NEON, virtualization support, and on and on and on.

The benefits you mention are functional benefits, and these could have been brought to the public without the near pixel perfect design.<p>3. I somewhat agree, however I could remake the design of any website without copying and pasting in a short time. It would take a short time because all the time that was spent designing it has been done by someone else.<p>4. Maybe slightly, but he took what someone else had produced without permission, at best this is a slightly scummy thing to do. He tweeted Dustin to let him know that he had done it, he could have just as easily asked. If Dustin had refused then he'd be free to make something which fulfils the same function, but isn't a clone.<p>For the record, I'm not sure exactly where I stand regarding IP, but I'm not talking from a legal perspective, just an ethical one, and I don't think this is ethical nor HN's praise of it.<p>I live in China, a country mocked for its cloning. If the Chinese had hand written the GroupOn site, for example, rather than copy/pasting it, most people who still think it's low. It seems to me more that people think that a) Dustin is a bit of a dick and b) open sourcing something means you can do whatever you like because it's for the good of humanity.",1332512942

TL;DR: I rant.<p>ONE: I can't find the citation of the scientific paper on ExtremeTech. (Let alone a link. Who would dare to dream of a link?) They do refer obliquely to ""the paper"" once. (What paper?)<p>And they link to MIT's press office, whose brand is really solid, so everything they write is almost like science! And there you can skim the article twice and finally spot the citation:<p><i>Susumu Tonegawa, the Picower Professor of Biology and Neuroscience at MIT and lead author of the study reported online today in the journal Nature.</i><p>Okay, gotta go find an online <i>Nature</i> subscription to find out what's going on. There's an hour of my day spoken for. At least they're trying to ensure I get some exercise.<p>Why is the actual journal article important? Just look at this thread here on HN. We have people doubting all sorts of things, but these may well be things that are addressed in the <i>actual work</i>. The content of the popular articles means very little: They leave out most of the details. The details matter. The whole <i>point</i> of this study is to try and tease out more details.)<p>TWO: But, wait, there's more. I first tried to read ExtremeTech on an iPad (original edition). The article popped up in one of those insufferable iPad-only JS-powered ""mobile editions"" with Swiping Action. Unfortunately, there was only the first page of the article. It cut off in midsentence. I tried pressing the giant button marked ""Next"" on the right side of the screen. I got a big white screen. I flailed around with my fingers. A <i>completely different article</i> eventually rendered itself. I flailed around with my fingers some more. Eventually the original article reappeared, still incomplete. Fortunately, one more roundtrip to the next article and back and I finally got the whole thing to render.<p>Then I pressed the back button and everything seemed to hang. I closed the browser window and thanked the gods for my escape.<p>Why on earth do publications use these broken things, when simple web pages render so nicely on the iPad? The site does have something like a dozen tracking cookies on it; does this imply that they have data showing that swipability is so important that it <i>doesn't even have to work</i> in order to attract more ad impressions/clicks/Tweets/whatever? Or does it merely suggest that they are so busy struggling with glass-cockpit syndrome that they can't perceive that their site is broken on the iPad?",1332512666

The SIM card, as a piece of plastic used to identify your phone number and mobile operator, is indeed pre-historic technology. It's quite unbelievable that we're still using such a system in 2012. Unless I'm missing something, what a SIM card does could easily be done in software and this is part of what the OP is suggesting. I don't think that there is any doubt that the SIM card, as a data / identity storage system should be retired.<p>Issue #2
The issue of operator-issued mobile phones being locked to that specific operator is unrelated to whether or not the phone uses a SIM card. A phone can be locked to a specific operator, regardless of whether or not it uses a SIM card. In many countries, operators lock all their phones, meaning that you can't use a SIM card from any other operators in your phone.<p>If you live in a country where all phones are sold unlocked or where phones can be unlocked after a certain period of time, it's almost certainly because mobile phone operators are being forced by law to do so. Not because the phones use SIM cards.<p>So the freedom to switch between operators at any time isn't a technical issue linked to SIM cards. It's just a matter of whether or not operators can legally prevent you to do it. If operators can legally lock their phone, they'll obviously do it. Why wouldn't they?<p>It's worth noting that if you want an unlocked phone, you can always just buy it straight from manufacturer - there's nothing that forces you to buy a phone from an operator (apart from the price, but I'll touch on that later). So this issue is actually already solved - it's just that many people don't think their freedom to switch between operators is worth the upfront cost.<p>Issue #3
Being tied to a long contract and not being able to switch between operators and plans at anytime is another unrelated issue. But then, it's a pain you choose to have. There's nothing that forces you to sign up for a contract. Most operators offer pay-as-you-go plans with no contracts. In the UK for example, well over 50% of the population is on pay-as-you-go (or was the last time I looked) so pay-as-you-go can definitely work.<p>Obviously, operators much prefer when you sign up for a contract. Just like tech startups go crazy for subscription business models - it's nice to get money automatically every month. So they try to trick people into signing up for long contracts by offering subsidised phones. And many people fall for that.<p>What it all comes down to.
Most, if not all these problems, arise because of the perception by people in most countries that mobile phones should be free or reasonably cheap. People don't find it a problem to spend 600 on a laptop. But tell them they have to spend 600 to buy a new phone and they freak out. This is despite the fact that many people do the same thing on their phone as they do on their laptop and use their phones a lot more than their laptop.<p>It's this way of thinking that results in far too many people signing up for long contracts with operators, allowing operators to subject them to their every will. Changing this perception and making people buy mobile phones in the same way as they buy laptops (i.e. without subsidies and straight from the manufacturer) is what we would need to really change the statu quo. Whether or not phones use SIM card is merely a small technical detail (but one I'd love to see fixed nonetheless).",1332512023

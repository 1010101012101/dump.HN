As long as the upload prompt is called from within a user-generated event (i.e. the user actually clicked on something, which raised an event, which ended up arriving at your code), this will not interfere.<p>Also, this has been well-known for some time.",1224586489

338810,comment,338214,338468,0,0,jsmcgd,,,"Hmmm. I don't think we're in disagreement. I never claimed the market is perfect. My point is its miraculous tendency for self correction even in spite of fraudulent practices and bad government policy. You cannot expect this kind of silly buggery to fall under the jurisdiction of market forces and we don't. That's why we have laws and tried and tested policy. When you violate this that is when you get into trouble. And that is exactly what happened this time. It wasn't business as usual that got us into this mess. However at least we have a free market to get us back on track. Heavily socialist systems can shield people from the truth of the problem and they can languish indefinitely as a result (an extreme example: The Great Leap Forward). Free markets won't.",1224585714

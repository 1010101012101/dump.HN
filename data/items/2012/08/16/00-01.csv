Wikileaks is fantastic, but we can credit him for his involvement with that without whitewashing the person.<p>Even if I were to only accept the parts his own lawyers have conceded, the statements do paint the picture of someone who is quite a bit of an asshole. Maybe he is a bit of a misogynist, though I think it's more likely he is ""just"" a bit narcissistic and didn't really take anyones feelings into account. Add in some paranoia - even if people are after him, he comes across as believing they care more than I think they do.<p>I just think there are a lot of things about this case that are fishy to the point where there's good reason to be extremely suspicious about the motivations of some of the people involved, even if one discounts the idea of US involvement. He might very well be guilty for what I know, but that still doesn't mean there's nothing weird going on with how the whole situation has been handled.",1345078790

So long that I started and released my first Android app while waiting for an iOS app to be reviewed.<p>FWIW there's some ways of mitigating the iOS review times.

4389206,comment,4381371,4387875,1,0,einhverfr,,,"Agreed on this point.  The idea is that the comments should have something to say apart from the code.  You don't put a footnote in a book to repeat what you just said.  You put one in to add a reference to something else, explain a caveat, or otherwise say something useful out-of-band.<p>In general, in my experience, the people who are most hostile to willy-nilly comments have some of the best commented code.  They see the code as written both for the computer and the programmer, and the comments are thus either interface promises, or are footnotes.  Most of the people like this I have worked with tend to produce extraordinarily readable code which contains a good number of comments which should be there.  But the worst codebases I have worked with hands-down are full of comments.<p>As for your exception, I agree.  I think it's worth flagging such comments however so that the reader immediately knows that this is a special clarification.<p>The last time I described what my code did, I was using Perl 5.6 or something and was trying to do a method call to a fixed name in a variable package and was having a horrible time.  I ended up, I think, using the symbol table directly and the syntax was worse than hairy.  It was downright misleading.  So I added a comment something like:<p># HELP!  I can't find a better way to write this.  The syntax is ....  Anyone have any suggestions?<p>If you understand you are writing for a human audience and that your comments will be read only if generally useful, then the this leads to both code clarity and comment clarity.  It may not always be possible to maintain and hence one would add comments explaining tradeoffs or flagging a section as unclear (and possibly explaining it).  But these are avoided as best one can.",1345076824

Then I think, as others have said, Google decided Flash support was hurting Android instead of helping it (once you have critical mass, cross platform tools become a competitive disadvantage instead of the reverse) and probably told Adobe they were on their own and that was enough for them to decide to kill it, and killing it swiftly and making money from people forced to convert was better than killing it slowly.<p>I do think they really tried, for a while, but it just didn't work.",1345076553

Every time I visited her in the dorms it was customary for everyone to yell out, ""alert, man on board"".

Despite this unwelcoming atmosphere many were eager to inform me of the boy's club, patriarchy, and male privilege like they were reading a script of political talking points.

They are socialized to feel like victims even though they go to a fancy school the average male couldn't afford.<p>Yes, there are gender centered problems that need to be addressed.

I personally don't use it, but I have no delusions about the cost that comes with resisting. You miss out on events, news and connections. And because of Facebook's ubiquity, no other social network is a complete substitute.

This means you can't reuse that code to apply to multiple nodes at once.   Same thing applies for both javascript and css.<p>I know it is semantically significant but in practice it is just hardly ever needed and frequently causes a royal pain in the ass.<p>BTW, performance is rarely a good reason either since by definition there is only one of anything that <i>might</i> be considered for an id so you can always find the element by class then save a reference to make repeated fast references.",1345075412

1192730,comment,1191671,1191879,0,0,mseebach,,,"> I think the terrorism threat is overblown. This is going to sound horrible but very few people are killed by terrorists compared to pretty much every other cause of death.<p>Between the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and the work of intelligence services, we've been successful in keeping jihadist terrorism out of the west for five years now. But the safety we have within our borders here doesn't extend to a 10.000 mile railroad passing through a dozen countries, several of which are anything but politically stable.<p>I mean, would you take a ride in the countryside of any ME country in a bus with ""I'm a rich American/European infidel"" painted on the side? Then why do the same in a train?",1268654026

1192726,comment,1192672,1192672,0,0,_delirium,,,"Andrew Gordon has a history of pretty interesting work this area, and is probably one of the best researchers in the overlap of symbolic knowledge representation, data-mining, and pragmatic approaches to commonsense-reasoning problems--- areas that often like to resist overlapping.<p>This sounds like the sort of work he's as well placed as anyone to do. As a commenter on the linked article points out, it's ""epistemologically unsound"" to mine data in this way, and not even humans really understand causality. And yet, as that comment misses, humans are able to make routine use of casual inferences, even though we don't ""really"" understand causality, and we acquire our causal information in ways that are almost certainly epistemologically unsound (people do not usually use careful scientific experiments in building their everyday models of how the world works). Even uneducated and very young humans can do stuff along those lines that'd be amazing for AI to be able to do! It'll be interesting to see if approaches like this one can help computers pragmatically acquire similar levels of proficiency about causal relationships, as an alternative to, say, large databases of consistent, carefully hand-authored facts like Cyc.<p>His page: <a href=""http://people.ict.usc.edu/~gordon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.ict.usc.edu/~gordon/</a>",1268653575

If China wants to do this, good on them, and I wish them all the best.<p>Most of the suggested route go through political volatile areas, such as Iran. Say, they develop the nuclear bomb and NATO decides to bomb and/or invade. Now it's a war-zone and every foreign service in the world advises against travelling there. The link is unusable for 5-10-15 years. Russia frequently has fall-outs with their neighbours to the extend where they shut off gas in the middle of the winter.<p>But the biggest issue isn't what we know now - it's what we don't know. Such a rail road has a lifespan of decades, if not more. The Train-Siberian railroad is 100 years on.

Plus, whenever something negative happens, always look at the positive side - in this case, you get to keep equity.<p>Or, if you want a more Chinese perspective on the issue, an old story:<p>There was a farmer who lived in a village with son and they had a horse. One day the farmer’s horse ran away. His neighbors came by and said, “What bad luck! Your only horse ran away! Now how will you till the fields?” The farmer replied, “Good or bad, who can say?” The next day, the horse returned with five wild horses. “What good luck!” the neighbors exclaimed. “You’ve got five free horses!” The farmer replied, “Good or bad, who can say?” While the farmer’s son was breaking in the five wild horses, one of the horses stepped on the son’s leg and broke it. “What bad luck!” cried the neighbors. “Your only son has broken his leg. Who will help you run the farm?” The farmer replied, “Good or bad, who can say?” A few weeks later, war breaks out and all healthy young men are drafted into the army. Since the son’s leg is broken, he cannot be drafted. “You’re so lucky!” the neighbors say, and the farmer says, “Good or bad, who can say?”",1268652885

The ""øresund"" bridge linking Denmark and Sweden opened in 2000 at a cost of ~5.5 bln USD. It's 15.9 km = 9.9 miles, or $555 mio/mile. This was a successful project, using very well understood technology by people who just finished building a similar project 150 miles away, finished roughly on time.<p>A transatlantic tunnel would be 3500 miles, that's 350 times longer. Its completely unknown technology - no-one has ever submerged a vacuum tunnel, and no-one has build a mag-lev that actually goes 4000mph. And they're telling us it can be done for $50 mio/mile, less than a tenth of a regular bridge? I know it doesn't scale linearly, but I'd expect such a tunnel to be more, not less, expensive pr. mile. At the same mile-cost as a bridge, it'd cost $1942 bln.<p>I did a back-of-an-envelope calculation when this came out a while ago, that if all plane passengers from London to New York (can't remember the number now) were to switch to such a train, tickets would have to cost an average $10.000, one way, to cover 5% maintenance, interest and ROI.",1268651648

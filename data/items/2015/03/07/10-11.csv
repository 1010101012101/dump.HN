(Most notably: legacy copper wires offering DSL.) More wires can be run, just like cable TV was. It&#x27;ll be even easier now than the cable buildouts of the 60s-80s; the world is richer, awash in capital, with better tools.<p>Wireless also keeps getting better and is now competitive with wired for most daily internet needs – email, web, VOIP, audio streaming, light video, gaming – all except for bulk HD video. (Just like people have &#x27;cord cut&#x27; their cable TV to rely on net entertainment, others are &#x27;wire cutting&#x27; their fixed-line internet service, and relying solely on their wireless internet, from one of 3+ providers.) So speaking for the US, most people have 6+ options to get core internet service. That&#x27;s no &quot;ISP monopoly&quot;.<p>We agree that locally-franchised monopolies over certain wireline services are a problem, where they exist. (OTOH, some localities have enabled multiple cable companies and other competitive wireline services, like Google Fiber.) Those localities with bad policies should undo their mistakes, as they see neighbors and peer-localities having made much better choices. But those scattered problem communities are no reason to compel a specific national service formula on all ISPs everywhere, even where there is competition.",1425724729

Then he say it is class action with many others and ALLi do a fraud.<p>Always a story to send money again and again. Then I am suspicious.

If you did something and you didn&#x27;t do it <i>well</i>, you&#x27;d better do it in secret.<p>I wasn&#x27;t <i>free</i> from those feelings, but it wasn&#x27;t as emphasized; and as I grew up, I eventually had a good base of things I was known to be good at... which in a way freed me to do other things badly.<p>And the funny thing about trying lots of new things (and doing them badly) is that practice makes you <i>better</i> rapid competence in new things -- this works in music, but also in anything else in life.<p>This is what I most want to emphasize whenever anyone talks about people with natural talent for music, for example (which can seem particularly magic to people with little experience of their own).<p>There are probably some inborn elements involved -- how well your ears work, etc. -- but so much really is learned, and once you&#x27;re hooked, the amount of &quot;practice&quot; in music and thinking about sound becomes huge.<p>I&#x27;m not a pro performer, and not likely to become one; but it&#x27;s something I love, so I probably spent 6+ hours a day doing something with music interleaved into it.  Not sitting down with an instrument, most of the time, but washing the dishes.  Driving the car.  Playing with my kids.  Walking the dog.<p>So I can imagine how pervasive it could be for someone really focusing their life on music.<p>Natural talent, sure; but don&#x27;t forget the <i>hundreds of thousands</i> of hours some people spend training their minds to the patterns of music.",1425722976

The 3 month notice is when <i>employees</i> want to terminate a contract.<p>The way the usual contract in IT (CDI) works is: you can have a 4-month trial period, which you can renew once. Then the employer cannot fire you without &quot;serious cause&quot; (and &quot;bad performance&quot; does not qualify).<p>Some side-effects of that are:<p>- Employers are afraid to hire, leading to long-term unemployment.<p>- IT is dominated by huge consultancies (because companies prefer to contract out than hire).<p>- As an employee, it is almost impossible to rent a flat in Paris during a trial period (because we <i>also</i> have laws that make it impossible to expell people who don&#x27;t pay their rent).<p>- Acquisitions are complicated because the acquirer needs to keep the <i>whole</i> team. An exception is companies that go broke (in which case they can fire part of the team and then be acquired).<p>I understand why we have those laws, they are useful to protect some categories of people. But for higher revenue professions, we would be better off with a contract that is more flexible. More and more people are trying to work around this by creating single-person companies instead of being employed directly, but it is a mess (and the state is doing all it can to make it illegal...).",1425722946

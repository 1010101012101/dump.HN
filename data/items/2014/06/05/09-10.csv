A mother was upset that someone confiscated the hammer and saw her kids were using while she was away.

(Price is unrelated to my previous argument, but I&#x27;m pretty confident that the price per part of an AMD A7600 will be far below that of the i7-4500u)<p>Also, for the benchmarks presented here, we have no details about actually consumed energy by the devices, and we don&#x27;t know what the devices consume during &quot;typical&quot; usage either.",1401960515

Certain diseases, e.g. PCOS (Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome) and (general) insulin resistance mean that eating X calories (assuming X is lower than the calories expended on exercise, and basal metabolic rate) will just make you extremely tired and unproductive. In these diseases, the body is unable to utilize the energy that you are consuming and unable to burn the energy you have stored already.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that all causes of obesity are related to a disease, but things are definitely not so cut and dry as expend more energy than you consume and you will lose weight. The body is an exceedingly complex system of chemical reactions which are fairly tightly regulated (see topics around MCA - Metabolic Control Analysis, to understand how systems of reactions don&#x27;t behave intuitively). Changing one input variable does not always yield the result you are looking for when you simplify the entire human metabalome down to an equation of calories in, fat storage and calories out",1401960514

It is clear that you wouldn&#x27;t be in the wrong there.<p>In Brazil, copyright law is slightly different (emphasis mine):<p>&quot;The current body of Brazilian copyright exceptions and limitations may be divided into three groups, relating to: 1) partial or full reproduction; 2) derivative works; and 3) performing rights. The three tables in the following sections provide an exhaustive list of the limitations present in Brazilian copyright legislation.[2] <i>The dominant view in Brazilian literature is that exceptions and limitations lists are to be strictly construed, with no credence given to implied limitations.</i> This is a primary tenet of Brazilian legal scholarship with respect to copyright; it is taken as dogma in academic writing and, as a result, often by courts as well[3].&quot;<p>What I understand is that unless it is explicitly laid out as an exception, court houses would look at it as infringement.<p>&quot;The reproduction of small excerpts of preexisting works of any nature, or of an entire work of visual art, is allowed within the context of a larger work. The reproduction itself must not be the main object of the larger work, and must not interfere with the normal exploitation of the work or cause unjustified harm to the legitimate interests of the author[3].&quot;<p>Your app is doing quite a lot with the screen-scraped data. You&#x27;re not just presenting it unadulterated, but you&#x27;re transforming it to present it in a way easier to consume. Don&#x27;t know if that constitutes enough for the scraped data to &quot;not be the main object of the larger work&quot;.<p>&quot;To integrate any given computer program into others, be it at application or operating system level, is permitted if done for personal use and unavoidable considering the user’s needs. Integration must be done for the exclusive use of the person who carries it out[3].&quot;<p>You could argue that your application is doing nothing more than displaying available information to people that already have access to it in a way that answers the user&#x27;s needs, but I don&#x27;t think it would fly here because integration is not &quot;done for the exclusive use of the person who carries it out&quot;.<p>&quot;Higher-education institutions in Brazil usually do not provide clear policy guidance on course readers and textbook copying. <i>In practice, the unlicensed reproduction of copyrighted material is essential to academic life.</i> Course readers, copies of book chapters and even entire books can be found in files hosted by copy shops, ready for on-demand reproduction. Professors usually keep personal files as well, in which they include all of their courses’ required and complementary reading material. Students are frequently seen carrying spiral-bound photocopied textbooks to class. This is all done without prior authorization from rightsholders[3].&quot;<p>I find it extremely ironical that an &quot;industry&quot; that thrives (IMO correctly) on copyright infringement, would go against a screen scraper for copyright infringement of <i>facts</i>.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-protect.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-protect.html</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.bloomsburyacademic.com/view/AcctoKnowledgeinBrazil_9781849660785/chapter-ba-9781849660785-chapter-0003.xml#10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomsburyacademic.com/view/AcctoKnowledgeinBrazi...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.bloomsburyacademic.com/view/AcctoKnowledgeinBrazil_9781849660785/chapter-ba-9781849660785-chapter-0003.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomsburyacademic.com/view/AcctoKnowledgeinBrazi...</a>",1401960303

I do persona development among other things. For the last 10+ years that&#x27;s been mostly in agile/lean contexts.<p>I&#x27;d disagree that the persona development is a long process. Persona documents are a communication tool — an artefact. It&#x27;s user research that (can) take the time if done traditionally. Persona are one tool in communicating that research.<p>Managing the research, doing the analysis/synthesis of that research - that&#x27;s the hard bit. Persona are one output from that. Your site reads like a persona creation tool - that&#x27;s not the hard problem.<p>That said, using persona well in more agile/lean contexts is an issue for some folk. It&#x27;s one various folk are already addressing in various ways (the ad-hoc persona structure you see from folk like Luxr, my incremental persona work, etc.). So there&#x27;s definitely a problem to be solved for some people.<p>However, in my experience it&#x27;s not really a software or tool problem. It&#x27;s a discipline silos / workflow problem.

It would have to be seen as an &quot;overall fitness&quot; type of problem.<p>This led me, of course, towards free weights and a training program of general experimentation. But a small free weight set in the home can be a frustrating experience with no space or supporting equipment like benches and racks, plus the chore of reloading dumbbells with light weight constantly. My friend was rightly concerned about whether it would work out for her.<p>So I reconsidered and landed on resistance bands. They&#x27;re kind of unfashionable now - and for certain things having barbells and dumbbells and plates would be a lot better. But they store and transport easily, have essentially zero setup time, and there&#x27;s plenty of exercises for them, many of which are straight-up adaptations of free weight movements. The more expensive Bodylastics set that I ended up buying, which was still only $70, allows for an enormous amount of resistance too. After doing that shopping, I kind of want to get some for myself too.<p>My friend probably would have been lost at the first step because it&#x27;s not like anyone marketing fitness actually tells you what you really need to begin addressing a problem. Neither will they explore whether the thing you buy is going to fit into your lifestyle. It&#x27;s pretty gratifying to realize that some cheap rubber is best for the job.",1401959183

Maybe it is if you invoke back in centralized trusted authorities (well, ignoring botnets), and indeed— this could be an advance over tor— but I think some careful though should be given to audibility of the authorities, since I think you lose that if you hope to hide the participation in the network from the public.",1401959127

7850962,comment,7850484,7850786,3,0,kylebrown,,,"I read the TorCoin/TorPath paper yesterday, and looked at some of the references including CoinShuffle[1] (a bitcoin mixing protocol) and Dissent[2] (implementation of a DC-net or Dining Cryptographer&#x27;s net, 2nd great invention by David Chaum after RSA blinding/anonymous e-cash). I&#x27;ll summarize what I learned here, hopefully someone will find it useful.<p>One of the key pieces seems to be the Neff shuffle (verifiable random shuffling of an ordered list of public keys). The Neff shuffle builds on ElGamal pairs (which themselves are the core algorithm in the verifiable voting system helios[3]). Dissent looks to be the application of a Neff shuffling technique to ferret out the malicious nodes in a DC-net (a provably anonymous communication network). CoinShuffle is basically the use of a DC-net to anonymously pool together a set of bitcoin public keys, and the coinShuffle prototype is a fork of the Dissent codebase. The TorCoin protocol specifies using anonymous or mixed bitcoin transactions (such as by using CoinShuffle or ZeroCoin). And tying it all back together, in the TorPath protocol we again find Neff shuffling, used by the assignment servers to generate provably-random Tor relay circuits from groups of relays.<p>1. <a href=""http://crypsys.mmci.uni-saarland.de/projects/CoinShuffle/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crypsys.mmci.uni-saarland.de/projects/CoinShuffle/</a><p>2. <a href=""http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/</a><p>3. <a href=""https://vote.heliosvoting.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vote.heliosvoting.org</a>",1401959077

7850957,comment,7847350,7850373,5,0,jacquesm,,,"Setting a flag is not the same as raising an exception. When you get a segfault that&#x27;s not because a flag was checked, that&#x27;s because a chunk of hardware interrupted the next operation.<p>So yes, you can check for overflow by inspecting a flag, but that&#x27;s not all that much better from coding around the potential overflow to see if your operands + operation combo will cause an overflow.<p>Imagine setting a flag on a divide by 0 instead of raising an exception.<p>So the author is most likely aware of the overflow flag (just like any other old timer that has programmed in assembly and that had a cursory look at the flags register, or in some cases more than a cursory look :) ), he&#x27;s writing about hardware exceptions, not about how to write in javascript.<p>But inspecting a flag simply isn&#x27;t on the same level as raising a hardware exception, right along with segfault, division by 0, FPEs and so on.<p>That instantly propagates through to any programming language executed on the machine. Checking a flag in a register is a decision by a compiler writer and many compiler writers (consciously!) ignore that (usually because the language specs are vague enough that wrapping is considered acceptable when it is in fact almost always simply wrong).",1401958952

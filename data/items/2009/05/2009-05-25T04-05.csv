625047,comment,624774,624774,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Related: As a means to fight cancer, large mammals have mechanisms to suppress telomerase and the other (alt) telomere repair mechanism.  Small mammals like mice do not have this.  Why?  It wouldn't help them.  Even if the cancer cells in a tumor could not lengthen their telomeres, many of them would still get big enough to kill the host.  (An inch-wide tumor might be no big deal for us, but for a little field mouse, it's as big as the whole body!)  Hence, there is no evolutionary benefit to these mechanisms, and small mammals do not have them.<p>It could be that whales do get cancer, but since it's much  harder proportionately for cancer to kill them as compared to merely large mammals like us, the cancer often goes undetected, and something else kills the whale.  After all, finding 1 inch tumors in a whale would be like finding a needle in a haystack.<p>Cancer cells mutate rather rapidly, to the extent that this often impairs their function.  If a cancer doesn't achieve and maintain efficient metastatis, it won't keep spreading.  Perhaps whales have enough bulk that they can simply absorb being riddled with tumors in what constitutes a small fraction of their bulk, allowing them to ride the cancer out until it mutates itself past the point of efficient spread and survival.",1243227487

I'm going to be turning 26 soon, and have been toying with the idea of leaving my job and spending some time (say, a year or more) travelling around and doing things I feel like.<p>It seems like a startup is something you can always do, but free-willing, low-budget travel seems to be the realm of youngish people.",1243227204

When all your competitiors have to pay higher wages it drives consumer prices up and so your revenue goes up as well such that you can also pay higher wages.</i><p>This is an argument for the ability of a business to <i>keep the same number of employees</i>, not to hire more. Keeping the same staff you had the day before doesn't make the unemployment rate go down.<p>This also assumes that your revenue goes up, which may not be the case since the government has instituted a staff-wide pay raise, but not all of your customers' incomes have gone up as well.<p>And sarcasm is sometimes a very effective way of getting a point across. Sarcasm in my opinion is fair game; being malicious is something else altogether.<p>*also, this doesn't answer the most basic question that proponents of higher minimum wage never seem to be able to answer, which is - if $5 an hour is bad, and $15 an hour is great, why not $30 an hour? And $50 an hour would be amazing, lifting people right out of poverty within weeks! So why not? After all, the unemployment rate doesn't go up as the minimum wage increases, right?",1243227120
625042,comment,624666,625009,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>""Prissy"" social correctors are at least smart enough to critically analyze the world around them.</i><p>That's not true in my observation. Most adopt a prefab ideology that they try to impose on the world around them. They like to label this ""critical analysis"" (or that old stalwart, ""thinking for yourself""), but it isn't: if it were, their ideas and positions and tone wouldn't be so predictable. Actually, trying to impose a rigid ideology on others is a large part of what makes them prissy. The OP seems to me a nice example.",1243227025

And as the comment above points out, you are also assuming that the $20/day is a guarantee.  It isn't.  The $20/day app is in the top 50 in its category.  That's a _successful_ app.",1243226750

Also, if I set out to ""encourage women in computer science"", it would probably be perceived as ""creepy"".",1243226736

<a href=""http://files.terriblefish.com/public/palm-pre-comparison-chart.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://files.terriblefish.com/public/palm-pre-comparison-cha...</a><p>Here is Palm's chance to name 8 things that differentiate the Pre from its competitors and what tops the list?  Physical Keyboard... good start.  Layered Contacts... what?  Exclusive NASCAR Content... really, that makes a list of 8 features?  And then it just devolves into pretending AT&T charges $150 for what Palm's charging $99.<p>On a somewhat unrelated note, where does one find out real information about the Pre?  Does it have a 3.5mm headphone jack?  A notification LED?  A mute switch?  Will syncing with a Mac be supported?<p>There are so many things I hate about my iPhone but there aren't really any alternatives, as I don't want to carry around a BlackBerry/G1/etc AND an iPod, so I'm ever hopeful of promising new phones.",1243226580

CDT can probably cross-reference your code about as well as LXR if you tell it about your compiler & include paths.  ""Jump to declaration"" (F3) and call hierarchy (Ctrl-Alt-H) are among my favorite shortcuts for tearing into a new code base.<p>I'm assuming you're talking about C/C++ here...  for Java, Eclipse or other IDEs would fit the bill.

625029,comment,624715,624715,0,0,vlad,,,"People have been trashing iPhone's dev program since Apple first announced it; however, those who are making money in the store were ones who ignored hype around Android and made apps for a phone that existed, and reaped rewards when iPhone OS 2.0 launched.  And so on.<p>Claiming the app store is not a guaranteed gold mine long after its become obvious to everyone that it's quite saturated is not very useful.<p>Yes, avoiding hype is important (dropping Android and making iPhone apps.)  But it's more important to replace it with another form of ""doing"", not just dismiss the art of software development.  If not developing on the iPhone, then what?  An article with an answer would be more enlightening.<p><i>As software entrepreneurs, we fail to do this time and time again.  We measure the market by its huge successes... After years of playing the web game, I still canâ€™t believe people think like this.</i><p>You created 20 apps on the iPhone.  That means you kept pumping them out, all to make $20/day from your best selling game?  And you say others should realize it's a crap shoot?  Sounds like you made it a crap shoot.  It also sounds like you're the one who ""thinks like that"", and not most others (I imagine very few developers have 20 active apps total, let alone on a single platform.)  What you are criticizing others for mainly applies to you and rarely to any other developer.",1243225864

There are a lot of people who don't make it through the weeders that should.<p>However, i just can't fathom how it could be the case that there's nothing we can do about it, regardless of what our ages may be.  Why aren't we addressing the pipeline into the industry?  That can take the form of direct involvement with the lives of students (which is also something that should be undertaken carefully.  My wife took programming classes in high school, and even her instructor for the class was creepy), or indirectly, again through trying to defeat the stereotypes about who is in our industry.<p>And i think we need to broaden our perspective on where the feeder into the pipeline is.  Why aren't we trying to get analytical individuals from other fields who already do train their students to think analytically?",1243225676

625025,comment,624685,624975,0,0,dejb,,,"A agree with the importance of marginal utility but disagree with your 'marginal' maths. The pay off with these mega jackpots needs to be in the 10s of millions to make it positive net value. I'd argue that the marginal value of money starts to taper of considerably at around between $2m and $5M. So the extra say $35M of jackpot money won't really have as much value to you on top of the $5M you might normally win. So in marginal terms you are back to negative expectation.<p>Of course I think the marginal entertainment value is what gets most people playing.",1243225263

The benefit is for whom?<p>What about the inventors that got left behind because the other inventors got to monopolized his invention first? He didn't have a chance to try to put it on the market.<p>The problem is that the patent system cannot possibly account for all the impacts of the patents that affected the economy. The economy is a chaostic complex entity composed of many million of human beings making trillion of decision on the daily basis on what to buy and sell. The free market is astoudingly complex.<p>You have the audacity to think that you can improve the economy by imposing a monopoly on that one lucky inventor. You have no idea the unseen consequences that would result from your actions. Inventions never created, resource never allocated, and customers unsatisfied. The whole of history that we never knew changed forever by the course of a single patent.<p>Economic history is awashed with pirates producing books and making the authors rich, fortune ruined by patent ligitation, and untold stories of opportunistic inventors exploiting connections to widen their monopolies.<p>Interventionism in the free market is never without its cost. You would bet very well that the law of unintended consequences applied to the patent system as much as stupid laws mandating the price of gasolines.",1243224383

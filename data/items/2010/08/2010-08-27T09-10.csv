1638376,comment,1635764,1636148,0,0,dtf,,,"I think there's more to it than just mouse vs keyboard. The keyboard-centric power interfaces like Emacs, Vim and those tiling window managers have non-intuitive shortcuts and combining sequences that really make things go fast. Compare using a keyboard with Emacs to using a keyboard with Notepad.<p>The same thing for those mouse-centric applications. Linux window managers have a ""shortcut"" of holding a modifier combination and dragging anywhere within a window to move it, or dragging the nearest corner to resize it. This makes arranging floating windows fast and fun compared to Apple's more intuitive requirement of having to drag the titlebar, or that tiny little handle at the bottom right of the window.<p>Some of the mouse-centric visual programming environments you mention, particularly the ones that have many years of use behind them, also contain shortcuts. Autodesk's Flame compositing environment for instance, traditionally driven via a pen and tablet, has a whole bunch of shortcuts to drive the interface without touching the keyboard. You can connect dataflow nodes by ""kissing"" for instance - dragging them close to each other, allowing you to connect many nodes with a single movement.<p>For many people, it's the mastery of these shortcuts - keyboard, mouse, pen or touch - that gives them a sense of pleasure and power when they use that piece of software.",1282902527

Even CSS is called this way, and I properly output the css file to the browser via php...<p>So I'm thinking of trying to automate this a little bit:<p>1. Store page contents in a database - but I'd be storing html, with a text interface to work on the files, not a GUI.<p>2. Have a page navigation structure with automatically generated navigation menus.<p>3. Allow for multiple page templates<p>4. Allow for multiple widgets/plugins that I'm currently thinking would be how a template is made. So this could be things like a list of the most recently updated pages to a calendar of events, or... I'm not totally sure yet.<p>5. Have page/widget/not sure what other level of variables - like for pages, an associated ""page title"" variable that the page header widget would look for and use somewhere in the graphical header area of the rendered page, as well as put in the html 'head' section so it appears in the browser's titlebar...<p>I suppose I want to be a little inspired by Wordpress and its concept of pages (as opposed to posts) and its widgets and customizeable sidebar; but try to make it easier to write useful plugins, and make the page templates themselves a part of what's stored in the database.<p>Does this make sense so far?

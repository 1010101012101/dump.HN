The game would be free on the app store, but would cost $5/mo after 30 days.  (I'd prompt each user for billing info from within the app.)<p>The reason I didn't devote my energy to that project is because I don't want to develop a product that hinges on a billing mechanism that circumvents the app store, because that seems like it could (perhaps rightfully) piss Apple off, since they wouldn't be getting their cut, and my game would be vaporized at Apple's discretion.  Not that there's anything wrong with that -- it's their platform, and they can manage it how they like.

404257,comment,402131,402131,0,0,dreeves,,,"What you're actually trying to do is known as price discrimination.  In other words, you want people who value the spaces more to pay more.  Airlines, for example, do this by charging more if your trip doesn't span a Saturday (since that means it's likely a business trip and business travelers tend to be willing to pay more).  Grocery stores do it with coupons (by your willingness to cut out coupons you reveal yourself to be more price sensitive).  More generally, companies often do price discrimination by offering two tiers of service (like Windows Professional Edition vs Windows Home Edition, or whatever).<p>So you'll have to come up with something like that.  None of the auction proposals (Dutch, M+1st price, whatever) will do it because everyone will pretend to be poor.<p>PS: Student/senior discounts are another classic form of price discrimination (the assumption being that students and seniors tend to be more price sensitive).",1229746707

404255,comment,403869,404127,0,0,drbarnard,,,"Well, technically Apple is regulating the distribution, which is factor of supply.  I'm not an economist and may be mixing certain terms, but the bottom line is that I can't sell an app directly to a customer, so the App Store is inherently not a free market.  Therefore, Apple IS regulating the supply of my products!  How much is debatable, but as someone who has several apps in the store, and talks quite frequently with other developers, I'd say my argument in the blog post is the reality of the current market.<p>Also, the charts are ""voodoo"" in their ability to create exposure for an app.  You have to have enough sales to first get into the charts, but once you're there, it's amazing how things change.  I've had developers describe it as being ""sucked"" up into the top 10.  There is an undeniable momentum that is created once you break the top 50.<p>As far as changing how the charts work, did you read my blog post? What I suggested is that apps be ranked by volume<i>price or even (2</i>volume)*price to calculate the rankings.  That's no easier to game then the current system.  People have to buy the app either way, and raising the price will only benefit apps that have enough value to warrant a higher price.  The idea of the App Store charts is to get the best apps in front of people.  My argument is that by ranking only by price, you're getting cheap apps in front of people, not necessarily the best ones.  By taking price into account, amazing niche market apps that can demand a higher price will get the same exposure as a broad market $.99 app.<p>I definitely agree that search needs work, but even with search, there has to be an order in which they are displayed.  For a long time it was also volume.  Recently it changed, but I can't find any pattern to it.  With a ton of crappy apps in the store, showing search results in a random order doesn't help the consumer.  Popular apps should still be rewarded with good placement.  I'm just questioning how that popularity is determined.",1229746478

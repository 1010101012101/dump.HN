The trials are blinded, with more advanced studies using active controls (e.g., ordinary computer games[6], adult education[1,2,3]). Study staff administering cognitive assessments are always blind, and participants are blind in studies with active controls. The human consent forms describe the studies as comparing two forms of cognitive training. This is a good blind - in one study the wife of a control participant called my to tell me her husband loved the cognitive training because the art history education made him go to the museum more with her :-)<p>2. Study [3] in my post was conducted by Mayo and USC (and funded by Posit - the money has to come from somewhere), studies [4],[5],[6] were conducted entirely by independent academic investigators.<p>3. Active control groups control for the placebo/Hawthorne effect.<p>As I see it, the only meaningful question is which methods work in practice - and the studies show us that. If what you mean is do we know what the mechanism of action is, we are speeding up information processing flow through the brain and making it more efficient - speaking loosely, we're improving signal/noise ratios. Reference [1] in my post has an extensive conceptual background to this approach.  And we've seen that with studies of EEG/working memory [7]<p>[7] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2904363/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2904363/</a>",1366469976

The propensity to lay blame to pathetically extraneous phenomena, and remove all idea of human agency from analysis is representative of our modern ""touchy-feely"" idea that if only we'd all love and hug and sing kumbaya, bad stuff wouldn't happen. WRONG. At the end of the day, this guy - of his own will - decided to harm others by the multitudes. They strategically picked a venue with an incredibly large gathering and they CHOSE to commit this horrendous act. Now I'm not saying you're wrong and that the stigma of being a ""loser"" in immigrant communities may indeed been a factor in leading them to commit such a heinous attack on other human beings. What I'm saying is it's no excuse for it and if that's the case, then every homeless guy, riff-raff, and just anyone who plain isn't satisfied with their lives should feel free to commit mass murder 'coz y'know ""they made me a monster"".

    There's no NullPointerException in Ceylon, nor anything similar. Ceylon
    requires us to be explicit when we declare a value that might be null,
    or a function that might return null. For example, if name might be null,
    we must declare it like this:

    String? name = ...

    Which is actually just an abbreviation for:

    String|Null name = ...

    An attribute of type String? might refer to an actual instance of String,
    or it might refer to the value null (the only instance of the class Null).
    So Ceylon won't let us do anything useful with a value of type String?
    without first checking that it isn't null using the special if (exists ...)
    construct.

    void hello(String? name) {
        if (exists name) {
            print(""Hello, ``name``!"");

This laptop has the nVidia display (I historically have avoid nVidia, but the company is opening up and the non-proprietary drivers are getting better), bluetooth, WiFi, SD card, etc. all Just Working.  I am running 12.04.2 with the 3.5.0-26-generic kernel - I installed the linux-lts-quantal package to pick up the updated kernel and xorg drivers (better nVidia support).<p>Thinkpads historically have been very compatible with linux (our family machine is a T61 I bought off of eBay very reasonably).  Also nVidia display (very nice resolution LCD).<p>I also have a [edit] XPS M1210 vintage 2006 that also works very well, has since I bought it.  I initially dual-booted, but then never used the WinXP boot and ultimately booted it off the island.<p>The only niggling problem I am having at this point is getting the bluetooth mouse running after a suspend/resume.  Something is not coordinating in xorg - the work-around is to flip to a different virtual console and then back to the primary X11 console (<CTL><ALT><F1> <CTL><ALT><F7>).  There is also something wrong with the bluetooth mouse battery display in the applet which can crash the machine(!) on resume on my XPS13.  I'm not seeing that on my other laptops.  The work-around is to not turn on the mouse until the machine has fully resumed.  This problem came in with the linux-lts-quantal software upgrade and I expect it to be fixed Real Soon Now.<p>The key is to get a fairly generic laptop.  I don't buy Sonys, for instance, because they have a long history of using oddball proprietary peripheral chips/configurations that don't work well with linux.",1366468347

Open source encourages community development, giving back to the community, creating things for fun, working on interesting projects, and making things people can use for free. These are all good things that lead to successful projects.<p>My argument is not that the GPL is <i>unsuccessful</i>that would be absurd. I'm saying, for a given market, would a project me more successful with a more permissive licence, and thus a broader audience, regardless of whether the majority of users contribute changes back?<p>It's a complex question and it might vary quite a bit depending on a lot of factors. In my example, you have a largely company-dominated market with few users interested individually. The Rails ecosystem is very similar to this: lots of companies use rails, and the GPL would change that market enormously, in my opinion for the worse. In fact, I'd venture to say that the rise of Ruby and Rails have accelerated our current software boom more than any other projects, if only for setting an example of how open-source and corporate worlds can coexist and reinforce each-other positively. This specific result was almost entirely due to the choice of the MIT license.<p>In that sense, you could say that the huge success of MIT-licensed software (in many other measures, such as the extremely fast rate that the community grew, the rate of software improvement, the use of the software to create real economic value, and the driving of the growth of the software economy) proves you wrong, also.",1366467555

In and of itself, self-interest is <i>neither</i> ""good"" nor ""bad"".<p>Using your example, the person selling you bread is selfish -- the price you pay probably covers their production costs, plus some additional profit for their take-home pay. If they just started giving the bread away for free (i.e., they're no longer self-interested), you may see that as a good thing -- but what happens when the bakery closes down because it can't pay the bills any longer? Now, you're <i>forced</i> to bake your own bread, at least until a new bakery opens (if ever).<p>So, to re-iterate my earlier point with this new definition of selfish:<p>Taking somebodies code and not contributing back is <i>self-interested</i>. Some manager may see this as an easy way to get ahead, without realizing that they may actually be _worse off_ by not contributing back to the project (e.g., the project stalls out and now they're stuck using stale code and trying to maintain things themselves).<p>Using the GPL because you want to ""get a return on your investment"" is also <i>self-interested</i>.

So if you lose your connection and then you reboot the computer or the tool crashes (which is semi-frequent), you're back to where you started a log-in prompt.<p>In addition to that, just from a usability perspective, the software is a disaster. It is a mass of grey-on-grey text, modal panes, near-full-screen sliders, and unexplained icons that i dread even thinking about using. In addition, the tool adds an ugly menu-bar icon that you can't get rid of, and once you install the software you can never close it  if you try to kill the tool or any of its background services, the entire thing will respawn.

Just imagine an Amazon or a Taobao where you buy spices or coffee straight from the producer.<p>edit and move: In fact, a part of the pleasure of eating a good baguette is because you bought it to the boulangerie and met the guy who made it, or his wife. Same with cheese, or even more with wine (the summun of wine-snobism in to drink bottles that you got from the chateaux' cellar)<p>The Nescafe coffee I drink don't give me any pleasure of this kind, because I am not (or try not to be) emotionally affected by brands and  commercials.

All of the lies and deception Julian speaks of are possible because there is no systemic transparency or accountability in the information ecosystem.  All of those lies are abstraction events in the cognitive plane of existence and require action in the physical plane to manifest any outcome.<p>At the end of the day, I think people must step up to the plate and say, ""no, this happening, it needs to stop and I am cosigning this information with my community identity on the line.""  At that point, a wise community should support that person through any life interruption or transition, if the individual cannot.<p>The thing about living a lie is that it is extraordinarily expensive to sustain or scale because the lie must defy nature and reality.  The internet news information systems make it easy to proliferate small/trivial lies in/for a short period of time, but it makes any non-trivial lies much more expensive to sustain. People need more information, more transparency and more accountability.<p>If you have the accountability, you won't have the ""boy crying wolf"" problem at scale because of the individual cost of lying.<p>Ironically, one such platform exists and is six months into beta, but this community hell-banned it in week one.

5581433,comment,5580972,5581318,5,0,calinet6,,,"> The MIT/BSD/Apache 2.0 licenses are about trust and cooperation, not force.<p>This is the best description of both the purpose and the result of the license I've yet seen!<p>To me, it really aligns well with humanity. It matches the way people naturally work with each other. If you have a friend, for example, who always demands fairness with every situation, it can be a true trust mindfuck. For example, people who exactly split the bill at a restaurant down to the penny and the tax percentage based on what you ate. Or, people who will spot you $10 for a movie, but will force you to write an IOU first. I don't enjoy dealing with these sorts of people, since they make the assumption that I am untrustworthy. This is a type of negative reinforcement for your humanity. They make you feel bad simply for doing normal things. This is the GPL in a nutshell.<p>However, some people are the opposite: generous, giving, and the picture of unselfishness themselves. For example, picking up the entire check at a restaurant, or just splitting it evenly even though they had a smaller dish. Or spotting you $10 and saying ""don't sweat it, I know it'll come back around."" They make the assumption that you <i>are</i> trustworthy, and understand that you're human and fallible, but have good intentions. They make you feel good about yourself and about them, and you want to be friends with them; it's a positive relationship. This is what MIT/BSD/Apache feels like.<p>The second person might get burned sometimes by their unselfish generosity, but in the end, they make a lot more friends, and those friends like them and want to give back. Overwhelmingly, they receive more than they give because of the sheer multitude of positive relationships they build.<p>In the software world, I can absolutely feel this effect. When I see a project that's been GPL'd, I actually consciously and willingly resent them for it. I perceive they're being selfish with their work, they don't trust me to contribute back naturally, and thus they're making a bunch of pre-judgements and demands on me before they hand over the code. It's bullshit. I might use it if I have to, and I'll contribute back because I have to, but you know what? I won't enjoy it. I love open-source, but I can't shake that feeling of ill will.<p>MIT/BSD/Apache licensed software is the model of unselfishness. It's software being nice to me. It's software that trusts me and gives me the benefit of a doubt. It's software that I <i>want</i> to contribute back to, and I do, all the time. It's software that I <i>choose</i> to use over any alternative, because it's so much lower maintenance. It's software that's fundamentally cool. And furthermore, it's software that's likely to be higher quality, since it's more likely to be used by more companies with real large-scale projects. It's overwhelmingly better in all respects, and I recognize that in no small way.<p>If you're arguing for the GPL because you don't trust people who use your code to ""give back fairly,"" then you don't get it.",1366466874

The jihadists are reading the plain text of the Koran and the Hadiths and following them literally.  Moderate Muslims typically have very little scriptural text to stand upon when decrying ISIS and its treatment of infidels.  ISIS can be more easily argued to be following the &quot;most pure&quot; form of Islam.",1447768799

I love talking to people with different beliefs.  If we have a respectful debate based on our best evidence I assume we will both learn something.<p>2. Facts are facts.  However, I think all people build world views around those facts which interpret those facts in ways that are consistent with their non-scientific beliefs.  The scientific method is just a important to me as an agnostic in terms of whether a medical procedure is safe.<p>3. See answer 2. Many Christians have no trouble with evolution.  It was discovered by an Anglican after all.  It&#x27;s true that Darwin lost his faith over the discovery, but after a few years, many Christians just incorporated it into their faith.<p>4. It is very hard to prove historical facts, but there is good evidence for many arguments (like the resurrection for example; or that the King James Bible was developed by a committee). I think for many Christians, good historical scholarship is fundamental to the sorts of things that they now believe.  This works both ways; however.  For example, after the Divinci Code came out I was able to quickly discard the sorts of claims it made because the evidence was so bad.  Similarly, Richard Dawkins should not give up his day job to become a biblical scholar since he doesn&#x27;t seem to have the knack for it.<p>Cheers",1447768594

A more realistic comparison would be selling your car, cancelling your insurance, repurposing your garage, and comparing it with pooled ridesharing.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you think car pooling has to take a lot of time. Services like uberPOOL guarantee you will only be matched with someone going a very similar route -- otherwise, you get a solo ride (for the pool price). It typically doesn&#x27;t add more than 2-3 minutes.<p>Your time cost calculation is also invalid. When you&#x27;re riding instead of driving, you can use your time for other things. It may be checking up on your email, working on your latest project, or reading hacker news. You can&#x27;t do that if you drive. Ridesharing actually gives you more hours while saving you money.<p>There is no question that it&#x27;s more economical to have one driver for 3 riders, than having everyone driving. Traditional carpooling suck because of the low level of technology, network effect and optimization - but ridesharing achieves all of these and can be superior to driving.<p>I do not have a car. I never intend on getting a car. I don&#x27;t even have a driver&#x27;s license, and I know many people in a similar boat. How do I get around? I Uber + public transport everywhere.

Not now, for example. Second, beheadings seem rightfully barbaric and horrendous to us, but as terrible as they are, I think their impact is superficial in a way (though obviously not to their victims, and please make no mistake: I do not wish to live in a country that beheads people!). ISIS beheadings are a matter of <i>form</i>, a propaganda tool; a way to shock the West into action, and the local population into compliance.<p>But as for actual damage, compare their beheadings with the damage caused by some Christian leaders of First World countries who have been bombing cities in the Middle East and causing a lot of deaths. These conservative Christians sometimes describe themselves as &quot;born again&quot;, surround themselves with religious phraseology, describe their wars as Crusades and name them with Biblical sounding names (Righteous Fury, Infinite Justice, etc, etc), feel their countries have a God-given right to shape the world as they see fit. Wouldn&#x27;t people living in a city bombed by a Western country consider themselves the victims of Western religious zealots?<p>And if, say, we know Obama and Bush are NOT the same, are we not making the mistake of thinking every bellicose Muslim is exactly the same terrorist fundamentalist that cannot be reasoned with and must be exterminated?

This is important because ride sharing apps (particularly in a political context like Silicon Valley) are a free lunch: $200,000 spent on software development won&#x27;t even buy the land for a ten parking space lot in a place where it would be useful.<p>On the other hand, the numbers in the article suggest that a  ride sharing app could readily produce a ten parking space reduction in demand for a city like Palo Alto. And because the marginal costs of adding additional cities to such an application are negligible, reduction in demand for parking spaces across a region like Silicon Valley could be several times that.<p>In other words even if a ride sharing app is not going to pencil out into a possible unicorn, it still may be good public policy. And perhaps a better alternative to a public policy decision to raise the cash price of parking since it could induce willing social change via better communication infrastructure rather than forcing changes in behavior by pricing out those least able to afford changes in parking policy.<p>Parking policy is a great area for consultants to consult municipalities. Back in 2002 I was a junior urban planner in St. Pete, the city was &quot;debating&quot; removal of exiting parking meters installed for baseball in 1998. In the department library one day, I saw a study from 1962 that concluded that the parking meters installed in 1957 should be removed. The arguments are always the same: 1. Not enough spaces so install meters, 2. Meters are a hassle for local businesses&#x27; customers so take them out.",1447767942

I am very happy for the 0.1% of the population who live in an urban hugbox where they don&#x27;t need a car, but this is a general argument for 99% of the population or a unicorn sized middleman app.<p>My garage costs perhaps $50K lifetime, including land, maint, all added together.  An online mortgage calculator spat out $290/mo for my garage.  I suppose as a fraction of the cost of the house its not ridiculous.  Or at 20 working days per month, simply having the possibility to drive my own car costs $20 to park it at home.  Use it or not, I&#x27;m out $20 per day.<p>I bought the cheapest toyota out there for my commute.  Many people will insist on the largest SUV they can afford, but whatever.  Many people will replace their car every two years to show off conspicuous consumption whereas I drive my cars into the ground because I&#x27;m super arrogant and rebellious about not impressing other people.  Anyway simple straight line capex depreciation of $20K vs 250 commutes per year vs maybe a decade life of the car means each working day the car drops in value $8 no matter if I drive it to work or not.<p>Being a commuter car instead of a SUV I am kinda cheating on gas expense when I actually drive to work.  Figure 40 miles round trip at 80 MPH (I don&#x27;t live in CA LOL, and flex time a lot) and 40 / 30 mpg = 1.3 gallons burned per commute and we&#x27;ll pessimistically call the average price of gas over a decade $3 (LOL) so it costs me $4 to actually drive instead of car pool.<p>Now there are two ways the math argument kills suburban car pooling.  The first is I&#x27;m out $28/day to commute no matter if I actually commute, car pool, or call in sick.  The variable cost is a menial minimal $4 to actually do it.  So I do NOT save 100% of the cost of my commute, I only save about 10% of my commute cost by not commuting.  Why bother?  If I wanted to save 10% I&#x27;d be infinitely more likely to get an even smaller car or live in a cheaper area than to give up the convenience of my car for a mere 10% savings.  This argument is like people who pay $4000 mortgage and then shiver in the dark because they can&#x27;t afford the heating bill, its not that turning down the thermostat is a great idea, but its that they obviously demonstrate incredibly bad economic management to end up in a scenario like that.<p>The other killer is car pooling takes a lot of time, and regardless of how high or low an employer values his feudal servant&#x27;s time, outside work people seem pretty happy to drop $20+/hr to get drunk or watch theater movies or whatever.  So I feel $20/hr is a reasonable valuation of time for the general public.  Now lets say car pooling costs 15 minutes extra wasted time at each of four endpoints, for a total of an hour.  If you insist on matching up strangers online, they probably don&#x27;t live or work nearby each other.  Now an hour of free time is worth $20, and car pooling will cost me an hour, but save me $4... So car pooling puts me $16 in the lifestyle hole.<p>So mathematically I don&#x27;t save much money by occasionally car pooling, and the standard of living is dramatically lower.<p>I tried to calculate a math model for reliability and dropped it... its hard to compare a nearly 100% reliable toyota vs a very hypothetical service that may or may not match you up after hours and may or may not match you up with weirdo axe murderers or maybe not.  Basically you have one system that although expensive is nearly perfectly reliable and nearly perfectly safe, vs a pile of question marks that might ... might ... turn out as good.  Maybe.

In fact, ISIS would get even more sympathisers because by this time everybody would be sick of Saddam&#x27;s shit. Look at Libya. Khaddafi&#x27;s &quot;strong man&quot; reputation didn&#x27;t mean nothing when people started fighting back against his regime. Look at Syria. Assad is supposedly &quot;strong&quot; but this days, and historically he had very weak control of his country.<p>The idea that these people should be propped up because they are &quot;lesser evil&quot; has no experimental basis. Reminds me of WW2 &quot;appeasement&quot; honestly. It only makes the problem worse in the long run.",1447766878

I really dislike this, &quot;but xtians are less violent than muslims because they have a mandate to kill apostates&quot; approach, because it ignores so much of the reality. Not to mention, without diving into old/new testament theology, that there are plenty of commands to kill in the bible, even of unbeleivers (see Dueteronomy 17).<p>I grew up very religiously christian, but that changed after I went to war in Iraq. It took me years of reading, studying, and discussion with others to pull myself out of that mental bondage, and one of the things I realized is that it is religion itself that encourages irrationality, and that is certainly no false equivalance as you claim.<p>I see more American taliban where I live in the bible belt than I saw jihadists in Iraq. We have killed thousands upon thousands more men women and children. (Not debating justification at the moment)<p>That is not to ignore the varying of degrees of extremism and the probability scale on which one religion produces extremists over another, especially given cultural contexts which I would consider more important than the religion itself. (See differences between wahhabi suadis and shia who live in America)<p>That being said though, the real danger is for the west to accept the idea that this is a purely ideological war of muslim fanatics against the oh so peaceful christian (or culturally christian) west, all the time ignoring that same seed of extremism in us that mirrors our so called enemy.<p>Until we can admit that it is religion itself that is the danger, and the irrationality it encourages, this issue will never be solved.<p>Also, regarding France, And I may get downvoted for this, but wasnt France bombing in Syria for almost two months prior to the attack? I would be willing to bet they killed at least as many civilians as died in the Paris attack, not including military age males, but where is the outrage for the syrian people?<p>Ill tell you the main thing I realized about terrorism, is that we create terrorists faster than we kill them, and very few of them are purely reliously motivated. I put it this way to my family and friends:<p>I am a warrior first and foremost. If a random bomb fell on my house and killed my family, or a stray shot from an occuping nation in America killed my son, daughter, mother or wife, I can guarantee you I would be on a great warpath.\nIf the chinese invaded America because they claimed we were a terrorist country, and kidnapped my friend, we would try to rescue him by force if necessary.<p>If we want to reduce terrorism, the number one way is to stop fucking bombing every country in the middle east. not just that, but we need to stop propping up every dictator who has friendly policies to us and overthrowing any democratic movement that isnt friendly. We undermine the very foundational principles of America by doing so, and we should be leading by example, and not by force.<p>That is not to say force should never be used, for Im not a pacifist and beleive in the right of self defense, but I am increasingly having a hard time beleiving self defense means bombing countries halfway around the world.

IT has all sorts of articles of faith. vi versus emacs, I&#x27;m weird as I like nano. Religion is a way of living your life, my code is in no way affected by it. How I interact with my colleagues is, for instance I&#x27;d hope that having a nice easy rationale for being a good person makes me a decent co-worker. I&#x27;d rather not work with a hedonist who doesn&#x27;t give a fig for anything other than their own happiness, and with the internet we&#x27;re exposed to plenty of those.<p>3. I don&#x27;t view evolution, the big bang etc as contradicting my religious views. Genesis has been viewed as a metaphor since the 4th century BC. Creationism and biblical literalism are relatively recent &quot;innovations&quot; in some Christian traditions. It isn&#x27;t about the &quot;God of the gaps&quot;, it is about science revealing more of the complex creation we inhabit whilst being incapable of answering what the prime first mover was.\nThat said science only shows us what we can measure from the construct of our own perspective. It cannot, and does not claim to be able, to answer everything.<p>4. Being a member of the Church of England you have to be pretty aware of the historical context of religion! I&#x27;m not a biblical literalist and my church is not solely guided by what is in the bible. One of the reasons theology exists is to take all that knowledge and use that context to look at what we can actually divine from the bible.<p>Being religious doesn&#x27;t make you automatically not a jerk. Neither does being &quot;scientific&quot; provide an alternative, science isn&#x27;t a set of ethics. Up until the 1970s academic philosophy was viciously atheist (the only thing worse than a theist was an agnostic). However since then theism has enjoyed a resurgence and disciplines like epistemology have taken on the challenges raised by atheist philosophers.<p>As a counter-point let me ask a non-religious person, what makes an act good? Be wary of associating it with something which makes you feel &quot;warm and fuzzy&quot; about having done it, because then would you expect someone who did not get that same feeling to do it.",1447765896

The insightful part is the successful ride sharing services actual business model is psychologically tricking users into pretending to be taxi drivers and taxi customers rather than some random dude picking up anonymous hitchhikers which is what they really are.<p>The second semi-related insight is when the free market numbers won&#x27;t work, just demand the government socially engineer a private profit.  Specifically the part of the article where the government should artificially manipulate parking prices to make him the billionaire he is entitled to be because he is so much more deserving of a billion than everyone else.

In the first insight from the article, you can successfully run a middleman transport business, basically an online semi-illegal unlicensed gypsy cab dispatcher service, by convincing both participants to LARP that they&#x27;re taxi drivers and passengers.  In the second insight from the article, aside from all this complicated mathy stuff which is none the less true, you can tell a business sector is dead when the only serious business plan first involves LARPing like becoming dictator for life or mass social engineering or whatever other wish fulfillment.<p>The esoteric message of the article, as opposed to the mathy exoteric message, is the sector is dead because the only participants are the business hustler equivalent of joining the SCA and mistakenly thinking that means you&#x27;re actually the municipal government, rather than the reality of getting drunk with friends in costume.

And all or some of the other supernatural tales from the bible and the faith?<p>I am ashamed to admit that I didn&#x27;t realize until I was well after 25 that followers of the faith, some of them, really believed in such beings and that priests of the Christian faith have to at least pretend to do so as well.<p>I was raised catholic(I&#x27;m agnostic) and I always took &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; and Angels as tales and alegories, elements to tell a story.",1447765414

In an ideal world, this is when a multi-national force under the UN banner is actually warranted.<p>By the way this is the exact situation that American after 9/11 swore would never happen again - a safe haven for global terrorism to be planned and launched from.

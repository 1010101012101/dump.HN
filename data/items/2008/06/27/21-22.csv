230228,comment,229853,230220,0,0,ajross,,,"I agree, for the most part, with everything you way.   Some of the minor stuff is wrong: Greenpeace (the biggest player on the ""green activism"" front) caved on the nuclear issue a few years back and accepted it as a part of a carbon-neutral energy policy.  And the solar thing is mostly bunk -- you hear about it <i>far</i>, <i>far</i> more in propaganda pieces from the deniers than you do in the actual science community.  Is is a plausible hypothesis?  Yeah, sure.  Does it look like a better bet than CO2 forcing?  Hell no.<p>What drives me nuts, though, is the insistence on the part of the denalists here that because there is some disagreement as to numbers, the whole notion of carbon controls, consumption reductions, and the like need to be thrown out the window just because ""we're not 100% sure"".  That's a policy issue, not a scientific one, and it's just plain insane.  We're looking at a worst case (but still entirely plausible) effect of <i>mass</i> <i>global</i> <i>starvation</i> within the century, and the denialist attitude is ... wait for more data?",1214603801

When I was in France, I visited a town called aigues-mortes, where walls that had once been used to keep the mediterranean at bay were now miles inland.  England was once so warm that vineyards were common in the south.<p>So <i>please</i> don't take this as a denial of disaster... I admit ignorance here.  But hasn't the earth been much warmer while humans were around?  Is humanity actually threatened, or is it that our modern civilization has gotten so hard-wired to our climate that we can't deal with change?  For instance, suppose we were going through a period of warming that was natural, rather than human induced - would we still be looking for ways to reverse it?<p>Or is it that the change is on such an epic and sudden scale that the temperatures of the past 20,000 years will all seem temperate after what the current round of global warming will induce?",1214602791

For me, it introduced the idea that it was okay being smarter than the adults around me as well as the beauty of having to rely on yourself.<p>""Zen Flesh, Zen Bones"" (Paul Reps) Short zen stories that drive home a point per story.  Suggest thinking about one of the stories for a whole day each and every day.  Helped me relax and be okay with who I am and what I am accomplishing.<p>""Kim"" (Rudyard Kipling) Great introduction into indian culture as well as the to relations between Britain and Russia during the end of the 19th century.  What really stood out to me was the spiritual search Kim's mentor takes as well as the significance attached to it.  Also worth the read is the thinking and training around Kim becoming a self-reliant spy.<p>""Foundations of Financial Economics"" (Chi-Fu Huang and Robert Litzenberger) Fantastic introduction into financial economics and derivations of key ideas in the theory and practice.  Authors were also involved in LTMC Hedge Fund and subsequent blow up.  (Chi-Fu in LTCM and Litzenberger in Goldman).  Liked seeing how Chi-Fu Huang went from mba student to phd student to professor to hedge master of the universe.  Very interesting.<p>""SICP"" (Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman)  Besides the obvious excellence of the book as an introduction into computer science.  It also showed me how human and approchable the ""stars"" of CS were as I had Sussman as a freshman advisor and Abelson responded to emails I wrote him before I went to college.",1214602401

But, what's the point here?<p>The abstractions in emacs (modes and hooks are the ones discussed in the linked post) really aren't that strange, or unique, or even lisp-specific.

1190635,comment,1190389,1190450,0,0,vog,,,"Your analogy to WoW is a great idea!<p>In fact, WoW appears to be very addicting, to an extent you usually don't want to have in a game. (Unless, of course, you are the one who sells the game.)<p>However, for the work you consider to be important, this is exactly the kind of addiction you want. In that regard, we can learn a lot from WoW. I'm sure they have more ""tricks"" than just splitting big tasks into smaller ones. A study about that topic would be very interesting.",1268571508

1190622,comment,1190508,1190599,0,0,jacobolus,,,"For any economic system in a country to function also depends on having your chief export (copper, something like 70 or 80 percent of Chilean exports at the time IIRC) not having its price dropped through the floor by a huge and powerful country dumping its strategic reserves on the market all at once, on keeping alive your top military brass instead of having them killed by car bombs and replaced with guys eager to overthrow your president, on maintaining order despite agitation stirred up by foreign spooks and their covertly funded proxy organizations, &c. &c.<p>Chilean socialism may have been flawed, but it was never really given a fair shot.<p>It is indeed interesting to speculate whether a command economy could function effectively given modern computer hardware and software.",1268570462

People have already mentioned a lot of good solutions for a lot of problems, but trying to solve the wrong problem can make your's worse.. or at least frustrate you more.<p>It may be you're too distracted, so eliminate the distractions. Not me - I get overly focused.<p>It may be your task is so large and unclear that it seems pointless to even try, so first break the problem down into manageable chunks. Not me - I think I can do practically anything (but start :).<p>It may be your work is too annoying to you, so you wear out your self-control ""muscles"". If so, find different work. This isn't usually my problem either -- I'm pretty much free to do whatever I want at work.<p>It may be you subconsciously avoid heavy concentration. This is one of the symptoms of ADHD, so you may get lucky and be able to treat it with chemicals (see a doctor). This is my biggest problem.<p>I don't have trouble doing ""labor,"" but I amaze myself with the things I do to avoid thinking. I don't have a good, <i>healthy</i> solution yet, but I know a couple things that work for me:<p>1. Creating emergencies.. e.g. putting off a term paper until 6 hours before its due, or imagining you'll die of shame if you don't squash your bugs. My brain kicks right into gear when I <i>have</i> to do something.<p>2. Working closely with others keeps me engaged for other reasons. Pair programming is a good example of this, but not my preference.<p>I'd love to hear others problems and solutions.",1268569682

1190604,comment,1189682,1189952,0,0,Tycho,,,"To maintain a monopoly in itself would be expensive and not necessarily the way to maximum profits (there is always the threat of outside investors). Innovation of course costs money but if a company remains stagnant (because its profits are unaffected by competition) then it runs the long term risk of becoming obsolete when substitute technology comes onto the market. You could say competition is a short-term cost but non-competition is a long-term disaster.<p>In Apple's case, though, there's already plenty of tough competition going on.",1268569050

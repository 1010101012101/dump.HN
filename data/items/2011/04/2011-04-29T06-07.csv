I take photos of those places and linkapic shows me what the content creator tagged those photos (objects) with.<p>Right?<p>I think that a twist to your idea might be interesting. \nSay Content Crator tags objects/photos. The way you have it now I have to  take a photo of the same object to see the tag. Instead how about that if I am walking around you can show me nearby tagged images based on GPS.<p>There would be more discovery for me and less work. Taking photos of things and then waiting to see the notes sounds like work. But walking down the street and seeing interesting things that other people have taken photos of in the vicinity and tagged becomes interesting.<p>And it can be a tour because one tag can have directions to the next object etc.<p>---\nA side note: The discussion in your blog is meandering in my opinion (SEO/democracy etc) and the point is not well made. It would be best to just stick to the basic use case w/o pitching/marketing as pg likes to say.",1304060345

For example, you can reinforce the parent post with additional justifications, or explore corollaries to its conclusions. You can provide an example if it's a generality, or generalize it if it's a concrete example. Someone I don't know saying ""This!"" about a subject I'm no expert on is just as informationally-empty to me as that same person posting a single-sentence ""No, you're wrong.""

When I think of something that's valuable to the discussion (and therefore deserves upvotes), I think of the parents to these postsâ€”the ones that cause people to spin off tangents in all sorts of directions; those are what I want to see more of here. On the other hand, the expression of purely <i>normative</i> opinions, whether through the voting arrows or through long-winded sermons that still simply amount to ""Yay!"" or ""Boo!"", is something I want to see avoided altogether.

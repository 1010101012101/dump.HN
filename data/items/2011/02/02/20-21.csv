Ask them how much it costs to rent the place for a while. They do that, as attested by this rentals page:<p><a href=""http://www.carnegiehall.org/article/the_basics/art_hall_rentals.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.carnegiehall.org/article/the_basics/art_hall_rent...</a><p>It is probably quite a lot, but it may be less than you think.<p>Step two: Find some musicians with actual talent to fill out your program at the Hall. Hint: Classical music students are not rich. And they love to perform. And they're astonishingly talented.<p>Better idea: There are a bunch of college a-capella groups. There are a bunch of high school music groups. All those folks might love to perform at Carnegie Hall. Especially if it's an event with a bunch of other groups. And their parents might love to come. And their friends.<p>Step three: Schedule your concert. Charge enough admission to cover the cost of the hall and whatever you have to pay your musicians. Donate any leftover money to a charity. Preferably one with lots of supporters who want to come and fill out your audience at Carnegie Hall.<p>Step four: Come up with something you can play during your more-than-slightly-comedic opening act. I'm a banjo player, so naturally I suggest the banjo. It sounds cheerful and three chords will get you through a lot of folk repertoire. Fallback position: The kazoo. (But don't overstay your welcome. The joke will get old <i>very</i> fast.)<p>And you're on!<p>What have we all learned from this Ferris-esque exercise?<p>A) Being a concert promoter is not, in fact, rocket science. (Being a <i>consistently profitable</i> concert promoter is a different matter. But that isn't our necessarily our goal, is it?)<p>B) Oops, by ""make Carnegie Hall"" we didn't actually mean ""stand on stage at Carnegie Hall and play an instrument in a way which entertains hundreds of people"". Not just that. No, we meant something much more intangible and ineffable and... well, unobtainable. We want to Arrive, whatever that means. What does that mean? Perhaps we should think about that. And what of all the people who <i>have</i> made it to Carnegie Hall, many times, to public acclaim, but still have found themselves unsatisfied or even terrified?

But I'm 38 and if I died tomorrow, none of that crap would amount to a hill of beans except that my family would be reasonably provided for and would think I was a super swell, no-nonsense guy.  But it takes an immense amount of courage to begin to eliminate the noise and take on more signal.

If you're running with durability enabled, and you experience, say, a power outage, then the member should rejoin the set and resync with no issues. If a node's drive crashes, then you'll need to restore from a recent snapshot (within a day or so) or perform a complete resync if you don't have snapshot. But this can all be done without taking the replica set offline. In that last case, there is some manual work involved. But your post, unless you've corrected it, implies that replica set failover is completely manual. That's certainly not true.<p>2.

This is an idea from a book ""The Summer Kitchen"". In there the lady opens a pastry shop in a rich neighborhood. The grand opening they do a mother daughter cupcake party since their brand is we are family. they do a whole lot of other things - a good read.<p>2. Per the book ""Feeding the Media Beast"", news is something that is new, not ordinary. Duh. So what can you do that would say you are not ordinary. I was reading an article about a bakery that made a doughnut cupcake and had a  cupcake that was smothered with maple syrup and bacon. This was reported in last week's Boston Sunday Globe. Yes that makes definitely stand out. Plus they made sure that they ONLY sold these maple bacon cupcakes on the weekend. As the book ""Influence"" says use scarcity to attract.<p>3. First you need to identify who is your ideal customer profile. Who is coming to your shop? Why? They are not just coming because of pastries. help them maximize this experience. make it an experience. How can you help make not just a trip to the pastry but something more.<p>4. As in the book ""The Entrepreneur's Manual"", he speaks about a barber who started a barber shop that gives free drink with a haircut. Yes it became widely successful. Then he realized that the guys were stuck with the kids since the family comes together into town to shop so he provides a free baby sitter while you get the haircut and provides a barber especially for kids. then he realizes that women want to get the free baby sitter too so opens a womens shop. This book is the bomb. The Gap analysis in here is terrific. Do the gap analysis for the pastry shop - see what is missing.<p>Hope this helps.",1296678015

Take a class (or classes) on your new endeavour.  Any kind of introduction to the topic that's something you can document and put on your resume is a start.<p>2.

Then start talking about it at work, have a hallway conversation with your boss if nothing else.  Try to legitimately wrangle a way to redefine your current job to include some element of that (""Boss, can we apply Six Sigma techniques to managing $SOMETHING?"").  Ideally he/she says yes, and now you can legitimately list experience with that topic... but if not, just keep talking about it, write some reports on it and send them to people, and then - when talking about your old job - mention how you ""spearheaded an initiative to implement Six Sigma, blah, blah, blah...""<p>And from here, you just working to fight your way into a new job doing your chosen $WHATEVER, by hook or by crook.<p>One other little note about the above... your current boss might not be to eager to let you totally redefine your current job, but - assuming your doing a good job already and aren't considered a slacker / loser - you can usually get away with asking to do something extra.

2171883,comment,2169904,2169904,0,0,iloveyouocean,,,"I launched an online dating site FlowMingle.com in 2008 (since closed down).  When we were building the site on '07 and looking for investment, over and over we heard 'Your site isn't viral/social enough.  Look at WooMe, look at Zoosk, etc.  They will eat your lunch!'  and with regards to OKCupid ""It's at best a niche site for geeks and freaks, it's growing too slowly, it's not viral enough.""<p>Although this TC article is hardly news for anyone who has examined the WooMes of the world for even 15sec., I find the fact that WooMe is outed as a scam and that OKCupid is acquired by Match.com to be hugely vindicating.<p>By providing users an honest, transparent service that legitimately helps them achieve their aims, you CAN and eventually WILL profit and grow.  The damage in investors betting on companies like WooMe is that 1) they scam bunches of online daters and turn them off from the whole industry, they disappoint and lie to people 2) other entrepreneurs see big investment and media coverage for a company like WooMe and think they should chase after that model and mold their businesses to what investors want rather than what users want.  3) ultimately, investing in WooMe doesn't create any long term value and is a waste of time/money and starves other legitimate businesses of opportunity.<p>Just because a company is getting investment $$, press, meteoric growth, etc does NOT mean it is actually delivering anything of value and/or helping its users achieve their goals.  There is always opportunity to win against ANY competitor by doing those simple things.",1296677393

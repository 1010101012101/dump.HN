I built a very initial prototype by March 09 or so, showed it to some key people, then trashed it and started work on what became ModuLock.  We arrived at a rough version of this around March of this year, and installed into our first (beta) property in May.

While I definitely understand how that emotional turmoil can lead to psychosomatic symptoms, I don't think that is what is happening here.<p>My last job, by pretty much any measure other than income, was worse for me than being unemployed. Near the end I had been out on multiple stress leaves (I think the total was 5 weeks out, beginning about 9 months prior to my dismissal) and was generally in bad shape. My stress level was so high, in fact, that my boss (the good boss I had for about six months, but before the stress leaves) took me on a detour during our morning coffee run and bought be a bottle of Valerian pills to try to calm me down.<p>During all of that, I never developed these sorts of symptoms. The only physical effects I can really think of were the insomnia and a case of strep throat during one of the leaves which that same boss said was likely caused by my stress decompression.<p>Having said that, however, after reading that article this morning, my wrists have felt better than they have in months. I've been attributing that to a) the stretches I found on YouTube this morning, and b) the right-before-bed ibuprofen regimen I described above.<p>I'll definitely give Sarno's work a second look, but I'm so worried about ruining my life by permanently damaging my wrists that I doubt I can really commit to any approach which requires me to actively ignore signs of potential damage.",1278581838

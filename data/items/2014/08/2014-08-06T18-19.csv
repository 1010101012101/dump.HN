Microsoft used to do this thing all the time - it would hear about a competitor offering a new feature then announce it was going to be shipped as part of the next version of Windows, killing any interest in the competitor. Then (inevitably) there were months/years of delays while they actually built the thing.<p>The worst example was when OS/2 looked likely to gain a foothold in the PC market and Microsoft claimed that the next windows would have essentially all the OS/2 features (then delayed the next release for an eternity and shipped without many of the core features). The goal was just to shut down a competitor, not to actually announce a new feature.",1407351556

Its cool to see Lyft and Uber offering the service.<p>IMO, a big win for consumers, because offering more service-level options, and driving down pricing.  With Hitch, it usually costs me $9 for what costs $16-22 on UberX, Lyft or Sidecar.  Thats a nice savings, even if it takes me 10min more to get home.  I could really see mass adoption coming from the service who nails this and provides the option that is better than Muni, but cheaper than individual car service.<p>Another aspect of this service I wasn&#x27;t ready for was that the social dynamic can completely change the ride-sharing experience.  Its different when you are just chatting with a driver, vs a 3rd or 4th stranger jumping in the car.  It will be interesting to see how others react and expectations evolve as it becomes mainstream.",1407351517

Or the high schooler who wrote a book for NANOWRIMO, self-publishes it, but doesn&#x27;t know the first thing about copyright law or needing to continually do extensions.  The copyright inevitably lapses, and some publisher finds it, likes it, and starts printing copies and selling them because it&#x27;s in the public domain.<p>I really, honestly believe that we need to reform copyright, but I also think we need make sure that it doesn&#x27;t favour people with money and people with access to intimate knowledge of copyright law.  I think everyone probably has at least one copyrighted work to their name, so we should make it a goal that just about everyone should be able to understand copyright.",1407351344

Bash is stuck at version 3.x there, too, for examples of different tools on different platforms. Some Linux distributions come with dash as /bin/sh, whereas others still use bash there.

The goal was to have low performers self-identify themselves (whether or not you agree that taking this offer predicts low performance).<p>In this situation, Microsoft has announced that layoffs will be coming soon anyway, and presumably they want to get rid of the low performers. How do you identify which are the poor performers for something as commoditized as factory workers? Offer them a phone if they quit – the poor performers probably can identify THEMSELVES as poor performers, and so they see their termination as imminent anyway. So they&#x27;ll take a free phone if they can get it.

Because general-purpose OSes don&#x27;t isolate applications from each other like, say, iOS, it would only take one neglected utility performing a software update over plain HTTP to be able to turn MITM into remote code execution with access to your entire computer.<p>If you are an ISP, you can of course commit MITM of HTTP traffic on any of your customers trivially.<p>The WSJ also shows a screenshot of a faked &quot;download the latest version of flash player&quot; screen, presumably on a non-HTTPs site. If your ISP is also a trusted CA (which I believe is not rare) they could also be MITMing HTTPs traffic as well.<p>It would seem that if you <i>and all of the software you run</i> uses HTTPs all the time and if your OS enforces code-signing so that, i.e., only Apple can patch iTunes, you&#x27;re pretty much immune. A VPN might provide some defense, but the ISP with which your VPN terminates could be ordered to perform/allow the same kind of MITM attack with the same result.<p>Interestingly, this sort of attack featured heavily in the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, except that she and her friends (lacking control of ISPs) would actually go to people&#x27;s houses while they were out and wire MITMing devices into their cable/DSL connections. Having administrator-level access to an ISP would obviate the need for field operations, hence the NSA&#x27;s infamous &quot;I hunt sysadmins.&quot;",1407350644

When I was at my mom&#x27;s house, technology was heavily limited, and in the hour a day I was allowed online, they were hovering over my shoulder the whole time. When I was at my dad&#x27;s house, unlimited access.<p>I definitely gained more benefit from the unlimited access. However, I&#x27;ve always been a person who has been both very inquisitive and strongly ethical. I self-censored a lot of smut from myself online. I also used my time constructively. At age 12, figured out the ins and outs of audio codecs (I wanted to get audio files from my favourite NES/SNES games but wasn&#x27;t allowed Napster, so I figured out how to convert MIDIs to WAVs with WinAmp). Started learning about emulation, first as a way to play video games and later as a programming exercise. I stumbled across the Earthbound hacking project as my introduction to assembly. Learned how to rip videos from video games. Fucked around with Blender for 3D modeling, and made a few shitty Flash programs. Eventually wired up my computer into the home theatre system. I played with network sniffing tools and taught myself the details of TCP/IP, wireless, mail protocols, etc. I played with various linux boot disks (Slax, Ubuntu, Arch) just to see what happened, figured out how to do sysadmin stuff from that.<p>I did all of this before I turned 17, and I did it specifically because I had unlimited, unsupervised access to computers and the internet. I can definitely see that perhaps others wouldn&#x27;t be quite as driven as I was (my brother and sister, same opportunities, but they just fucked around on Facebook/youtube/etc). But at the same time, I think there is a certain subset of people (such as myself) who drastically benefit from unrestricted internet access.<p>And, TeMPOraL, I&#x27;m right with you. Most of the things that technophobic people spend their time on in &quot;real life&quot; feels like total nonsense. My mom, stepdad, and extended family still mock me for wasting all my time online, and yet they spend an ungodly amount of time watching shitty TV all day.",1407349900

If you have a reasonable estimation of the amount of methanol in your mash, then throwing out enough of the head takes neither skill nor testing.  Without that knowledge you need either a moderate amount of skill (to determine when methanol is coming out of your still) or the ability to test for methanol, but not both.  I have done this myself and spoken with multiple people who have done it.  It sounds like you are talking about re-distilling your heads and tails to get every last drop of ethanol out of them.

Heavy metal and other contamination seems much more likely (though I would expect them to be quite rare as well).<p>As for industrial ethanol including methanol, some of it probably would without a law requiring it, but that would certainly not be universal.

WPF addressed a real need, I think; developers wanted a decent GUI stack (which Win32/WinForms/MFC/whatever just ain&#x27;t), and long term, Microsoft wanted something amenable to 3D acceleration and DPI increases. Great.<p>Except that for the longest time, WPF was deeply problematic for any major application. Problems around text handling and performance were the biggies. Microsoft had no real internal customer for WPF. Some of the Blend apps used it, but they (now discontinued) were never a critical part of Microsoft&#x27;s day-to-day operation.<p>When did WPF get good? When an important application (Visual Studio 2010) started using it, and made clear that hey, something needs to be done about that text rendering and performance.<p>I think there are quite a few little corners of Microsoft&#x27;s software in a similar boat. The new-to-Vista sound card/audio APIs were plainly not fit for purpose in their original form, but nobody in Microsoft noticed, because nobody in Microsoft was actually using them. Late in the development cycle the APIs were updated (adding notifications when a buffer was nearly empty) to make them usable, but it created a troublesome driver situation for a year or more post-release.<p>With the internal customer, the feedback becomes much more immediate. Microsoft&#x27;s customers don&#x27;t get to see every 3 week cycle. Internal customers do.<p>When the developers are using the very product they&#x27;re developing, this becomes better still; there&#x27;s an implicit understanding of what the thing should do, and how it needs to be better. This becomes institutional knowledge, and it likely never even manifests as an explicit request. It doesn&#x27;t have to. The implicit understanding of how customers are using the software and not just what they want but _why_ they want it is sufficient to ensure proper and effective implementation of their requests.",1407348800

For instance, I believe a &quot;robotics mechanic&quot; will be a job of the future, analogous to an automotive mechanic. Today there are experts/specialists in different automotive systems like transmissions, electrical, etc. Likewise, robots will need specialists in perception, locomotion, cognition, etc.<p>But robots of the future will not be designed to do one thing, as cars are (press throttle, move forward). They will be complex, autonomous decision-making machines, something the world really has never dealt with. I imagine the support infrastructure needed to deal with such machines would more closely resemble the healthcare industry than the automotive industry.<p>For example, you would have your highly trained specialists as I mentioned, but also generalists skilled at diagnosing and repairing common issues, and of course support staff needed to assist them in their jobs. Thus you have tiers of skill so that if a robot displaces a housekeeper(for instance) he doesn&#x27;t have to get a PhD in order to find a new job in the robotics industry that made him obsolete.",1407348609

This, of course, was widely reviled by anyone that did any actual work.  The software developers analyzed a loophole and published the exploit to the local branch office.  From then on, people wore whatever they liked, and just kept a logo-embroidered fleece jacket draped over their work chairs.  A few bolder individuals purchased a company-logo lab coat and wore it around the office.<p>The branch manager never reported any violation of the dress code--because technically there were no violations--but did take care to inform everyone ahead of time whenever employees from headquarters were scheduled to visit.<p>At another job, the dress code was to wear clothing <i>when customers were in the office</i>.<p>The actual median daily apparel worn in those two different offices were virtually identical.  The latter simply showed greater variance in styles of dress.<p>If I had to maintain an entire closet filled with garments that I would never want to wear anywhere outside of work, that would severely irritate me, to the extent that I would almost certainly become well acquainted with a pearl wholesaler, despite the apparent physical impossibilities involved.<p>But it is a perfect indicator that management is willing to impose arbitrary, capricious, top-down working requirements on employees, without respect to consequences, intended or otherwise.<p>So not only do I endorse the prejudicial maxim to not do business with suits, I extend it to teams whose dress appears suspiciously homogenous, uniform-like, or logo-emblazoned.  I want to deal with people, not mooks, peons, toadies, or serfs.

I&#x27;ve been a super user for years, and I was happy to give foursquare all of my data because they did two great things with it:<p>1) they gave it back to me so I had an accessible record of my check-ins which is very helpful if you travel frequently, and very lovely if, like me, your personality combines deep nostalgia with shocking forgetfulness. It also made Timehop worth opening.<p>2) they used it in seemingly intelligent ways to give me surprisingly good recommendations when I needed them, and showed me where friends had checked in, even if they hadn&#x27;t left tips. A check-in from a friend can be a tiny endorsement of its own in absence of anything else.<p>Both of those benefits are what keep me checking in.

My interview consisted of me adding a new feature to that project and explaining everything.<p>Would I have been able to have gotten the job without the actual Nanodegree? To be perfectly honest, probably. However, the Nanodegree provides structure to a rather cluttered catalogue of courses (not entirely a bad thing). Worth $200/mo? (That&#x27;s how much it was for me to do it at the time). It depends on the person. Certainly cheaper than something like General Assembly or App Academy (not comparing the two as they are entirely different things, but they have similar &quot;guarantees&quot;).<p>But knowing what projects I had to do, and what courses I needed to take to prepare for those projects, made it much easier for me to go through the curriculum, rather than just taking ALL of the front-end courses, ALL of the AJAX courses, etc.",1452751142

I live 11 miles from work, but it&#x27;s impossible to get there via any reasonable public transportation-based route in less than 1 hour.  On flat land, I can bike at least 50% faster than that, in normal clothes, without breaking a sweat.<p>The BART portion of my trip takes around 25 minutes.  Once I get off BART, my choices are basically to take Muni or walk.  Walking gets me there reliably in around 25-30 minutes.  Muni theoretically gets me there in around 15 minutes, but that&#x27;s in an ideal world where there are no delays on the line and I don&#x27;t have to wait to transfer.  I&#x27;d rather end the day $2.25 richer and get the little bit of exercise than save a whole 15 minutes.  And, of course, the same goes for the trip home.<p>People who live in, say, the Outer Sunset and commute to SOMA or the Financial District have even worse options.  Your Muni trip involves taking 2 or 3 buses, and there&#x27;s <i>no</i> other reasonable way to make the commute than drive (and we know how miserable and expensive driving in SF is).<p>[End Rant]",1452750767

10899868,comment,10891546,10891546,0,0,chatmasta,,,"One of my friends includes line breaks in his iMessages, which I find strange because it takes extra effort to accomplish the same effect of sending multiple messages. But it also allows me only one chance to respond. I can&#x27;t respond to his first paragraph while he&#x27;s typing the second, because he sent them both at the same time.<p>This makes me think that the critical difference between the &quot;Chat&quot; and &quot;Full&quot; case is the number of messages, not the UI. I would expect similar results if the &quot;Full&quot; case was three separate messages as opposed to one message in multiple paragraphs. A better &quot;Control&quot; case would have been a single message in the chat UI, with line breaks (i.e. shift+enter while in FB chat), in order to eliminate text density as a variable.<p>Dividing one message into multiple creates anxiety for the reader by obscuring when the writer expects a response. Each individual message could stand on its own, but the writer does not expect a response to each. When three messages are condensed into one, the reader has an easier time inferring that the writer expects only one response to the whole message, not one to each individual paragraph.<p>This seems to relate to the feeling of sending two highly coupled messages in quick succession, only to lose service just after the first one says &quot;Delivered.&quot;",1452750708
10899865,comment,10899374,10899804,0,0,iyzhang,,,"The leader bottleneck will continue to exist even if there great sharding because the leaders simply process more messages than the replicas, so TAPIR will allow each shard to support more throughput.<p>The paper has an evaluation for multi-data-center replication in Figure 12. We assume that the clients are web servers, so they are always close to one of the replicas, but not all of them. The result we found is basically that TAPIR performs better in the multi-data center case except when the leader is in the same data center as the client. So it depends on whether you can always guarantee that the leader is in the same data center as the client.<p>The abort rate continues to essentially track the latency needed for commit. So, TAPIR reduces the abort rate compared to OCC because it reduces the commit latency. At very high contention, locking is likely to make slightly more progress, but no systems with strong consistency will be able to provide high performance. If you are interested in some other ways to optimize for the high contention case, take a look at our work on Claret: <a href=""http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bholt/projects/claret.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bholt/projects/claret.html</a><p>We also tested with high clock skew. The paper notes, &quot;with a clock skew of 50 ms, we saw less than 1% TAPIR retries.&quot; Since the clients can use the retry timestamps to sync their clocks, it only adds an extra round-trip, so it still leaves TAPIR with the same latency as a conventional system, even in cases of extremely high clock skew.",1452750612

I treated it seriously, like a real programming language, and it served me well.<p>My favorite AWK program was probably my LaserJet II code listing program from 1991. I wrote this out of frustration with the terrible default listings I got when I printed source code. The AWK code did a &quot;two-up&quot; printout of source code: two pages of code per page of paper in landscape mode. It used a nice font and drew graphic boxes around the pages. I was in the habit of using separator lines like this in my code:<p>//-------------------------------------<p>So the program found these and changed them to graphic line separators. It also avoided splitting a function onto two pages if it could - it would leave whitespace at the bottom of a page instead, filled in with a faint dot pattern.<p>Somewhere I have a printout I made with this program; I was hoping to find it and scan it in to show what it looked like.

I would love to see these numbers where tapir is spread across larger geographical regions. My suspicion is that at higher latency will negatively impact the abort rate more so than with a strong leader. What about poor clock synchronization conditions? What about testing with a variety of client latencies? Since the client is effectively acting as a leader in tapir, the client is, in some ways, contending with other clients and the abort rate may be correlated to client latency. I don&#x27;t think high-latency clients observe this same correlation than with a strong leader. I wish more of the compromises were presented.",1452749193

Over the years it has evolved as any project does, but I started noticing more and more that OO was really not the right tool for the job of managing large inter-dependant systems (well, the Java/C# brand of OO anyway).  The promise of re-use, decoupling, composition, ... all seemed to be lies.  On top of that I started to get a sense of the common bugs that were coming through: null-reference errors being by far the biggest.  The in-your-face bugs like null-ref errors are relatively easy to spot though, what becomes more problematic over time is shared mutable state logic errors.  They can remain buried for some time.<p>I&#x27;d already had an interest in functional programming piqued by LINQ and Erik Meijer&#x27;s talks on Haskell.  I spent some time learning Haskell and F#, and came to the understanding that the stability and reliability of a system could be massively improved if null didn&#x27;t exist, if objects were immutable by default, and if functions were pure/referentially transparent.  Expression oriented programming became my order-of-the-day, but C# kept getting in the way.  Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t just drop it and move to F# because our code-base is huge and written in C#.<p>So that&#x27;s when I started writing csharp-monad [1], it was my first attempt at bringing functional concepts into C#.  It had a couple of problems though, and they were:<p>* The types were classes, and therefore if a function returned Option<T> then it could still be null<p>* It followed the &#x27;.NET BCL way&#x27; of having functions like GetValueOrDefault() - again breaking the safety net that an Option type (for example) is supposed to give.<p>It had benefits though, primarily that I could make composable computations with the various monads (using LINQ).  The problem with that approach was that it quickly bumped up against the rest of the BCL.  And, in my case, the rest of our multi-million line C# OO app.<p>So I mothballed that project to an extent.  I&#x27;d use it now and again where I had control over a process end-to-end.  But it got me thinking, that the main issues I had were:<p>1. Non-expression based C# constructs (if/else, switch, etc.)<p>2. OO-heavy core types, like List<T>, Dictionary<K,V>, etc.<p>3. Whenever I brought in 3rd party libraries that &#x27;did functional&#x27;, they wouldn&#x27;t work with my Option type in csharp-monad, or any of my functional types - and they never could because there&#x27;s no <i>baseline</i> for functional (other than LINQ) in C#.<p>4. The lack of more expressive LINQ grammar makes it less useful and sometimes more cumbersome than Haskell&#x27;s &#x27;do&#x27; notation or F#&#x27;s computation expressions.<p>1-3 cries out for an equivalent of a BCL for functional constructs.  I was under no illusion how big a job that would be, but I could see real value in it: a unified set of types for Option, Either, Try as well as collections Lst, Map, etc.<p><pre><code>    &quot;A functional prelude for C#&quot;  \n</code></pre>\nAnd once I saw that C# 6 allowed &#x27;using static&#x27; I saw that as an opportunity to really create a &#x27;functional BCL&#x27; that actually looks like a functional language.  A chance to take C# in a more Scala-like direction (which if you think about it, is where it&#x27;s going, it just doesn&#x27;t have the libraries to support it).  So that&#x27;s when language-ext [2] was born.<p>Item 4 was more problematic.  I couldn&#x27;t create more LINQ grammar.  So I started thinking about it in a different way.  Mostly I wanted to create expression oriented code.  It was just safer.  But with C# OO you always hit that expression boundary.  So I thought about how I could control the boundary.  Some of that was to build &#x27;matching&#x27; constructs into the core types, but that wouldn&#x27;t deal with all boundary issues.  That&#x27;s where the actor system comes in (LanguageExt.Process [3] ).  I&#x27;d looked at Akka.net and its very Java-like API horrified me - it looked like C# 1.0.  So I took the idea that a LanguageExt Process (an actor) is a fold over a stream.  That suddenly created a very powerful idea that I could create packets of pure computation and wrap them with their state, and each message would evolve that state.  In one fell swoop it created a better and more controlled OO that can interact with pure functions - and all fully integrated with the functional BCL I&#x27;d developed.  It also allowed us to start breaking up our monolithic app in a much more controlled way.<p>So yeah, that&#x27;s the back story!  Sorry if it turned into War & Peace.<p>Btw, I am in the market for two developers at the moment.

I welcome any corrections. :)<p>So.<p>Copyright policy is decided at the Federal level. The people in charge of setting that policy are elected members of Congress.<p>Let&#x27;s assume that you can declare someone &quot;met and interacted with&quot; with a single five-minute conversation.<p>According to Wikipedia, California is the most populous state and Wyoming is the least populous state.<p>The CA Secretary of State reports that ~17 million voters were registered to vote as of the date of the 2014 general election. The WY Secretary of State reports that ~240 thousand voters were registered to vote as of that same date.<p>There are 124,800 minutes in a standard 40-hour-per-week, no-vacations-or-holidays work year. (60x40x52)<p>For Wyoming, each Senatorial challenger would need to spend 48,000 minutes per election cycle speaking to each registered voter. (240,000/5) That&#x27;s doable.<p>For California, a challenger would spend 3,400,000 minutes per election cycle on the same task. (17,000,000/5) For California, what you propose is not possible for Senatorial challengers... they&#x27;d have to do nothing but hold conferences for 27 <i>years</i> to get this task done. (3,400,000/124,800)<p>So, what&#x27;s the largest state where this <i>is</i> feasible?<p>This <i>might</i> be South Dakota (the 46th most populous state) (with -I think- ~514,000 voters). [0] If it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s definitely Alaska (the 48th) (with ~509,000 voters).<p>So, it is <i>physically impossible</i> to even pay <i>lip service</i> to what you propose in either <i>fourty-six</i>, or <i>fourty-eight</i> of the states in the US.<p>Before you get <i>too</i> cranky, I <i>do</i> acknowledge that the situation changes when one meets with one&#x27;s Representative:<p>In California the 27-year workload would -roughly- be divided over 53 representatives, meaning that they&#x27;d only have to spend just over <i>half</i> of a year meeting every registered voter in the state. But... this assumes a five-minute meeting. If that constituent meeting balloons to <i>ten</i> minutes, we&#x27;re right back in the realm of impossibility.<p>While the workload <i>might</i> be smaller in the smallest states, Representatives are apportioned by <i>population</i>, so I don&#x27;t expect that the picture would vary very much from state to state.<p>In short, your idea is promising, and would be <i>really</i> great to do... but there just <i>aren&#x27;t enough hours in the day</i> to make it happen. [1]<p>[0] I&#x27;m having a fuck of a time finding historical voter registration numbers for SD.  So, <i>that</i> voter registration number is based off of what I&#x27;m pretty sure is <i>current</i> voter registration data. :/ (North Dakota doesn&#x27;t even <i>have</i> voter registration!).<p>[1] Yes, my analysis ignores the fact that a campaign could <i>conceivably</i> be a multi-year thing.

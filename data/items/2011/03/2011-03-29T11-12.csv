I've only been a member of HN for about a week, but I'm addicted because of the positive attitudes that the majority of the members have.<p>By the way, I'm also loving RoR.  I went through some training on it a couple of years ago, but I was already set on PHP and didn't take it seriously.  Now that I'm actually learning RoR I can't believe I wasted my time with PHP all of these years.  I'm not going to say I hate PHP, but RoR makes things so much easier in comparison.",1301399981

So they will require quite an elaborate runtime library.
It will be good if they support optional type annotations like unpython, in the interest of runtime efficiency. The good thing is that unpython programs continue to be valid python code even with those annotations.

Yes you can infer soft networks from the email address books they've harvested etcetc but really there's nothing in those that  can't pieced together if someone wants to anyway. As far as I'm concerned Facebook's a busted flush unless you want to advertise to a slightly below average income demographic with too much time to play mundane online games and from a professional perspective a FB message or email address is about as serious as a hotmail.com one. The inevitable social network market fragmentation is already underway, I'm excited to see what it brings.",1301397389

I agree it's not a long term solution, but in house coders in a startup just don't sleep and work until done AND they know what has to be done. When something is off, they rapidly change/fix it. There are people making prototypes (working, not just screens) of iOS apps in a few days, good enough to visit potential clients / investors. There is no outsourcing process capable of doing that; explaining will take you more time. And outsourcers have no other incentive than payment, so they just go home at 5.<p>Where you would be right is if you want the same app coded on iOS / BB / Android / mobile Win / etc. Then you explain ones and you can put n expert teams on those.",1301396819

Soccer is a sport that is played by about 30 million Americans a year, but it&#x27;s a blip on the map at the collegiate and pro level here.  People simply enjoy different sports, and the local culture reinforces it.

I also took your post as an opportunity to elaborate a bit more on our model so my post got longer as a result.<p>> And there are organizations out there with great IT and clean data but (...)<p>This argument also works the other way round -- there are organizations out there with terrible data (and this is especially common with medical data), but there are also many high impact projects for which the data <i>does</i> exist in a workable form that are begging to be solved (and that we are actually working on solving). We are focusing on these in the short term, while laying the groundwork for the others in the medium-long term (both through the research arm we are building, and our data engineers). There is no reason not to get the low-hanging fruit first.<p>> I think that fleshing out the projects and areas of investigation you guys already have lined up (...)<p>Agreed. Since we created Bayes Impact two months ago our main focus has been on building the program from scratch and working on the projects as well, so the website has unfortunately taken a backseat. Another problem is that government organizations are very sensitive about communication and we can only communicate about our projects on their timeline. This results in us not having a website as fleshed out as we&#x27;d like, but this is par for the course for a new organization.<p>> I&#x27;d also suggest focusing the intensive course on analytical methods not the tools<p>Ah, I just saw the paragraph you&#x27;re referring to. I get how the language may be a bit confusing and will make the appropriate changes -- our goal is actually to do the opposite: we bring on individuals who already have the analytical methods but some may not have had exposure to best industry practices. Because we focus on building <i>production</i> systems and not just write case studies, it&#x27;s important to bring them up to speed in that minor respect. This is why we can spend only a week teaching tools -- teaching analytical methods to people without the required background would likely take much longer, which is not our target audience.<p>At a broad level we simply provide an avenue for data scientists to work on social impact problems in collaboration with domain experts, with us taking care of the overhead of scoping projects and doing the dirty work of acquiring and preparing the data as well as defining the implementation strategy. We also smooth out the edges in our Fellows&#x27; backgrounds if any but this is really not the core of the program.<p>Fortunately the pool of applicants as well as our current fellows does not seem to echo your fears but I&#x27;ll review and see which changes to the fellowship page could help remove ambiguities in the future.<p>Hope it helps clarify. Regarding the Parkinson&#x27;s project, feel free to reach out to me by email -- unfortunately we need to wait for the press release from the MJFF and the other partner before I can actually communicate about the details publicly.",1404287499

Instead of writing a bunch of nested for loops working on a bunch of mutable state in an imperative way, we use map, filter, reduce, fold, etc to explicitly describe the transformations we are trying to accomplish. Instead of allowing our code to crash when bad inputs cause an error, we use asserts to declare pre- and post-conditions. And so forth.<p>TDD style tests have their place, but they don&#x27;t do all that much to make the implicit into the explicit. If you use tests as a source of truth or a form of documentation, you are essentially saying your specification doesn&#x27;t actually exist except as some weird emergent phenomenon - and then you have to take the time to disentangle the assumptions inherent in the tests from the assumptions inherent in the choices of test inputs and outputs. Tests can, by their nature, only exercise an infinitesimally small fraction of the possible combinations of inputs and state transitions that your code can go through. So tests, which serve to validate the code, need themselves to be validated. How can we even arrive at the intuition that our tests are covering some useful sample of this gigantic state-space? Metrics like code coverage and the size of a test suite are only meaningful if you assume the tests themselves are sound in the first place.",1404285415

A quick bond search shows that several S&P 500 members, BofA included, paying over 13% on at least <i>some</i> of their bonds (no doubt the riskier ones).<p>Therefore 13% isn't usurious and probably a fair cost of capital for a small business.",1348999181

I'd expect funding spent on lawyers writing defencive patent proposals would be figured on the balance sheet as R&D, even though it isn't. Or R&D spent finding new ways to extend existing patent rights of a drug. Or finding ways to innovate without breaching competitors' patents.<p>Secondly, there's no evidence to demonstrate that the amount of R&D that happens with patents is more than there would be without patents. I think you're focussed on the upside - companies that do some more work because of protection. But that needs to be balanced against the amount of research and development that isn't done because of the increased barriers to entry.",1348998910

4592463,comment,4592351,4592351,5,0,gojomo,,,"My hunch is <i>yes</i>, there are successful patterns in Facebook that will propagate to many other software categories, both because they are beneficial and users have een trained to expect them... but then <i>no</i>, those patterns won't dominate completely, because certain countervailing needs will change/moderate/negate them.<p>For example, the 'news feed' is super compelling and attention-grabbing, but at least partially in attention-abusive ways. By intermixing updates of wildly different importance, provenance, and topic, a heightened sense of novelty is created. By the use of reverse-chronological order, a false urgency is created -- ""I must read/reply before it scrolls out of view!"" -- even when the topics aren't really urgent. So this pattern is a sugar/steroid/stimulant for engagements... against which the mentally-healthy will eventually have to <i>disengage</i> and replace with something more respectful of their attention, with truer cues about novelty and importance.<p>So I expect the 'feed' pattern to be copied everywhere it might offer a quick bit of 'sizzle' to interactions... but also for new ameliorative antipatterns to be developed, and modify or displace the 'feed', as well. Especially in productive contexts where entertainment/diversion/distraction is <i>not</i> the highest value, it will be tried but then modified or discarded.",1348997518

You might be 90% through rewriting it to be nicer only to discover that the remaining 10% doesn't fit with your design.

So it would have been better to commit 1 month of time over those 2 years to keep it on life-support.<p>* Speaking of resource allocation: Is <i>now</i> the right time to do this, you probably have a 100 tasks with manpower to accomplish 10 of them. Maybe this is better done in half a year when you have more hires, or not at all if some of those other 90 things are more important.<p>But finally, if it's really the right thing to do just do it incrementally as part of other tasks.

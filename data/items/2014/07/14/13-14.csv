8030915,comment,8030413,8030726,1,0,jaegerpicker,,,"Mobile games have been around for 6 years ( and that&#x27;s really pushing it, I&#x27;d argue that we only have 4-5 years of actual mobile game history to look at ) compared to 30+ years of AAA studio type of game dev. We are still learning what works and how to build games. More and more indie devs are figuring it out. Those are the people that are worth investing in. One of the underlining points of the article (granted it&#x27;s not pointed out) is that a lot of the same people are finding repeated success in mobile games (Ridiculous fishing, canabalt, Threes!), both devs involved in Threes! and all of the advisors mentioned in the article had already succeeded in the App Store.<p>The comparison to Tetris is also valid. It&#x27;s a very popular, simple to play, hard to master game on a wildly successful platform. A game that draws in large numbers of non traditional gamers.",1405346313

8030913,comment,8030439,8030807,7,0,jonnathanson,,,"Yes. More than one person&#x27;s hands at the company are almost assuredly dirty here. Maybe not directly, but indirectly.<p>No consumer packaged goods company, least of all a giant like Kraft, puts <i>anything</i> onto a box without many layers of approval and rounds of creative review. In this case, the buck presumably stops with the brand manager for the Mac & Cheese product. I doubt he or she would have even thought to ask about the IP origins of the maze when conducting creative review. Nevertheless, he or she bears some responsibility as the owner of the review process.<p>Most likely this maze was lifted and passed off as original by someone a bit lower down the food chain: an agency staffer, a freelance designer, or an artist at the company. But there is virtually no scenario in which that person&#x27;s contribution wasn&#x27;t reviewed a half-dozen times by people with managerial authority. At CPG companies, the package is an incredibly important and borderline sacred thing. Nothing gets onto the package by accident, and as such, it would be incredibly difficult for Kraft to argue its way out of responsibility.<p>Another possibility is that Nickelodeon (the owner of Spongebob) provided the artwork, including the maze, to Kraft. This makes identifying the proximately responsible party a bit trickier, but Kraft still bears a burden. It would also mean that <i>two</i> companies, and possibly two brand managers, had eyes on this.",1405346283

8030910,comment,8029695,8029695,1,0,DCKing,,,"Curious they&#x27;re explicitly naming this the &quot;final evolution&quot;.<p>First up, I&#x27;d be surprised if they continued with a &quot;Raspberry Pi 2&quot; soon. The RPi is still very adequate for its original goals in education and will likely remain so; it hasn&#x27;t ever been quite enough for people wanting a cheap server or media center except for those with very modest needs. Given their announced goals, I doubt that the creators are going to cater to the second group with a hypothetical RPi 2.<p>One thing that can be improved upon the original Pi is a more open SoC, but currently no SoC vendor will be able to provide a significantly more open one. Even if you pick an open source friendly SoC vendor like TI, there are currently no GPU designers for these SoCs that have open source drivers. It is unlikely improvemants can be made in that area that anytime soon.<p>The second thing they could improve for their education goals in the inclusion of a dual core SoC to be able to teach about concurrency. That would probably be quite a bit more expensive than the current Pi, for a feature that would not present <i>that</i> much more value for education.<p>So I&#x27;m wondering what they mean with this &#x27;final&#x27; comment. Will they simply stay with supporting the current Raspberry Pi models? Or will they start developing a second Raspberry Pi? Or will they develop other computing devices for education?",1405346256

It encourages calling functions without paying attention to all the parameters, which you usually shouldn&#x27;t ever ignore.  Just like you shouldn&#x27;t arbitrarily ignore return values.

Please don&#x27;t make that assumption.<p>It&#x27;s impossible to evaluate your example without defining the pedagogical goal. Your example test question cannot distinguish between proficiency in multiplying two three-digit numbers, and proficiency in selecting from one of four possible answers, where two are obviously incorrect.<p>That said, this question is biased in favor of students who have been taught estimation techniques, in this case, round, compute 20 * 10, and look for the closest answer. They will be able to answer more of these types of questions than students who can actually multiply the numbers, but haven&#x27;t learned the approximation methods.<p>Had the answers been &quot;1) 257.24, 2) 256.24, 3) 247.34, 4) 248.34&quot; then the other class of students would fare better. Then again, those who learned casting-out-nines would be able to reject two of these quickly.<p>It&#x27;s clear that sometimes ballpark answers are better than exact ones. In bookkeeping, it&#x27;s clear that exact answers are better. It&#x27;s possible to teach students both ... by taking time away from other skills which are also part of mathematical proficiency. A standardized testing system encourages monoculture teaching, so that all students are primarily taught the method most likely to be on the test, on the assumption that the test defines proficiency.<p>It appears that you have defined &quot;proficiency in the subject matter&quot; as &quot;ability to pass a standardized test.&quot; If so, then by definition it&#x27;s impossible to game the system, making this discussion pointless. Is that your definition of proficiency?",1405344622

Both parents worked and could afford a babysitter/nanny, or one parent&#x27;s income was enough for the other to stay home. The area is incredibly safe. I rode my bike to school.<p>At Parks, as this article says, the majority of students have a single parent household, with drug abuse problems, and extreme poverty. 2 of Parks middle school students were raped in a single school year.<p>Comparing Dickerson&#x27;s test scores to Parks&#x27;s test scores is insane. Should Parks, and schools like it, be held to certain standards? Yes. Absolutely. But excellence in education is affected by far more factors than the quality of the school and its teachers.

To a physicist this may seem natural, but to a computer designer, treating a set of boolean circuits as a continuous, differentiable system is a bit strange. Feynman&#x27;s router equations were in terms of variables representing continuous quantities such as &quot;the average number of 1 bits in a message address.&quot; I was much more accustomed to seeing analysis in terms of inductive proof and case analysis than taking the derivative of &quot;the number of 1&#x27;s&quot; with respect to time. Our discrete analysis said we needed seven buffers per chip; Feynman&#x27;s equations suggested that we only needed five. We decided to play it safe and ignore Feynman.<p>> The decision to ignore Feynman&#x27;s analysis was made in September, but by next spring we were up against a wall. The chips that we had designed were slightly too big to manufacture and the only way to solve the problem was to cut the number of buffers per chip back to five. Since Feynman&#x27;s equations claimed we could do this safely, his unconventional methods of analysis started looking better and better to us. We decided to go ahead and make the chips with the smaller number of buffers.<p>> Fortunately, he was right. When we put together the chips the machine worked. The first program run on the machine in April of 1985 was Conway&#x27;s game of Life.<p><a href=""http://longnow.org/essays/richard-feynman-connection-machine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://longnow.org/essays/richard-feynman-connection-machine...</a>",1405343122

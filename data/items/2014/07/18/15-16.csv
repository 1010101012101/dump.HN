8053726,comment,8053134,8053348,1,0,mjn,,,"I&#x27;m an expat in Copenhagen and definitely find it comfortable, almost embarrassingly so. It feels like being in a foreign country on &quot;easy&quot; difficulty level. Not only does everyone speak English, but at least in Copenhagen, English seems to be everywhere without even asking for it explicitly. Many things from the government (websites, forms, etc.) are published bilingually in Danish/English. And it works smoothly, often over the internet; very little difficulty navigating the bureaucracy. My workplace is also probably 70% English, though I work at an IT university, so that may be non representative.<p>There is also a lot of &quot;public life&quot; that uses English as the <i>lingua franca</i>, so someone who doesn&#x27;t speak Danish doesn&#x27;t end up isolated in just a little British/American expat bubble. Any bar in the city center will have at least 15-25% of the people speaking English (partly because there are a lot of foreign students). And cultural events at museums, universities, & hackerspaces are often in English to accommodate visiting speakers, expats, foreign students, etc. Many tech events are in English because even many Danish companies have non-Danish founders or cofounders (especially true for game companies). It&#x27;s interesting in part because there is so much English but the majority of people speaking it aren&#x27;t native English speakers, it&#x27;s just the language multinational groups end up with for practicality. That also makes Copenhagen a good place to meet many European nationalities. I&#x27;ve met a lot of German, Polish, and Spanish people in particular (in addition to Danish and Swedish people). Especially a lot of Germans, and except the ones who stick to all-German groups, or those who have assimilated and speak good Danish, they mostly end up in mixed groups speaking English. I think I would actually have had a hard time meeting this many Germans if I had lived in Germany; here we have some being-foreigners-in-Denmark thing in common to break the ice, and an English-speaking-by-default environment to make it easy to connect.<p>Of course there is a whole Danish-speaking cultural scene someone who doesn&#x27;t speak Danish misses out on, and Copenhagen would be even more interesting if you speak both languages. But for a country that isn&#x27;t officially English-speaking, the amount of English-language cultural stuff going on is surprisingly large.<p>(Oh, and the prices aren&#x27;t bad. Eating out is very expensive, but rent is way cheaper than urban/walkable American cities. I moved from the SF Bay Area and rents in Copenhagen are hilariously cheap in comparison to SF. Also cheaper than NYC or Boston. Maybe roughly on par with Midtown Atlanta, to pick a point of comparison.)",1405699101

Semi-experienced developers will still make this mistake by making bad architectural decisions in the name of flexibility or performance that end up locking them out of library ecosystems that means they are forced to reinvent the wheel even when they know it exists.<p>Doesn&#x27;t sticking with Django lock you into the ORM and it&#x27;s capabilities itself?

Here&#x27;s how I did it.<p>I went out to local community events with a focus on software and networked with other developers. Word got out that I (a student at the time) was a competent developer with open source experience. When I graduated, a few of my new developer friends tried to recruit me.<p>I took a job at a local startup as a software developer. I was going to build a new product, though the tech stack wasn&#x27;t decided yet. Soon it was decided to be Ruby on Rails. I worked through the Rails guide on building your own blog, then continued to learn it on the job by doing a small project that shipped. At that point I had enough experience to design the important project and start building it.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that while learning Ruby/Rails, I completely surrounded myself with resources. I would answer questions on StackOverflow, follow Rails blogs, watch screencasts, hang out in the IRC channels, read and review Ruby books, watch and learn from public projects on GitHub, etc.",1405698810
8053699,comment,8052957,8052957,1,0,cowbell,,,"Learning a programming language is a lot like learning a human language, but understanding math is how you learn efficient programming.<p>If you don&#x27;t use mathematical reasoning, then you&#x27;ll produce O(n^3) when you could have produced O(n). Any hack can throw together a script that will hobble along with 4 rows of data. Throw a million rows at the same script and it might terminate properly in a few years. Or maybe it just runs out of memory half way through.<p>Another problem is winding inefficient boolean branching. If you don&#x27;t understand boolean algebra, you either over specify cases which makes code cluttered and disorganized, or you under specify and some cases are not considered at all... The result in either case is always buggy code that crashes. It becomes like a virus. Other lesser programmers are afraid to fix it, because it&#x27;s so complicated. Instead, they just tweak the mess to accomplish their own goals, adding more bad boolean logic along the way. It infects everything it touches.<p>Finally, certain fields of programming, like machine learning, are almost entirely math and statistics. So, yeah, you don&#x27;t need math to (poorly) do programming (in certain fields).",1405698809

Overall, this is what I&#x27;ve found, compared to my place of origin:<p>1. Rent -- 0.5 - 1.0 what you&#x27;ll pay in a top-tier US city.<p>2. Groceries -- anything resembling what you&#x27;d get in the US will cost 1.25 - 2.00 of what you&#x27;re paying in the US.<p>3. Cars -- 1.5 - 4.0 what you&#x27;ll pay in the US. Insurance is somewhat cheaper however. Ditto maintenance. Gas is about the same.<p>4. Eating out -- really depends but say $30 - $200 for two people, possibly with drinks. You can eat cheaper food on the streets. You may or may not want to.<p>5. Electronics, watches, designer goods, etc -- significantly more than what you would pay in the US.<p>6. Domestic help -- if from a neighboring country very affordable, starting at $20 - $30 per day for maids and nannies.<p>7. Health care -- pretty incredible value here compared to the US. It would not be insane to go to a top-tier hospital without insurance here. My wife and I just had our son here. Excellent care for a fraction of US prices.<p>In other words, anything you might save on rent you&#x27;ll make up for on everything else, with the exception of healthcare and domestic help, which have very high quality vs cost.",1405698267

More tools in the toolbox.<p>> What is your particular career?<p>Software Architect (the good kind, who can code) though I&#x27;m trying to start up for myself.<p>> What were your moving expenses?<p>About 10k EUR, moving was 1k but you need 5k for a cheap 2nd hand car and 1k for health insurance and other costs.<p>> How much is your rent or did you buy?<p>Buy, 1.2k EUR a month mortgage on a house in an average town.<p>> Where did you move to/from?<p>UK to Netherlands to be with my dutch girlfriend (now wife).  That was 8 years ago.<p>> How are the schools?<p>Excellent, because they&#x27;re split by capability (vocational, technical, university).<p>> Have you become fluent in the native language and was the language barrier difficult to overcome?<p>I&#x27;m fluent through a combination of not fearing saying something stupid and investing 3k EUR in courses at a local university.<p>> How long have you lived in this country?

Has your quality \n> of life improved or not? How and why?<p>Cost of living is much higher: the social system here is better, the taxes are higher and more progressive.

Well they have a ton of stupid laws, lead wars, etc., but again that&#x27;s also true for the US and many other countries.<p>Like in most countries (again, including the US) it depends a lot on your political views, gender, exact position (Texas vs north), etc.<p>Of course it&#x27;s not Scandinavia, but I feel like which politician you consider evil tends to mostly depends on whose propaganda you get.<p>I get that certain things are worse and that Russia is poorer and stuff, so that sucks and that they don&#x27;t care for a lot of rights, but then you look at Afghan and Iraq war, look at Guantanamo, random police violence or the state of lethal punishments and things are put into perspective, seeing that they just have different problems, but not really more.<p>Also historically Eastern countries tend have been worse at hiding relations between private and political interests, how media is manipulated or how it&#x27;s always the same kind of politics, regardless of votes. That&#x27;s true. In Russia censorship is direct, while in the US you have DMCA take downs, national security letters, secret law interpretations, etc.<p>About democracy/parties: All bigger countries (China, Russia, US, ...) appear to have basically one major party with the same opinion and different branches of opinions in this party. Since they are actually mentioned in media, while opposition is not there is no serious chance for any opposition. This leads political stagnation in all of them. The US has two branches, not agreeing on exact spendings, but both pro-war, pro-capital-punishment, pro-capitalism, pro-neo-liberalism, privatized prisons and against human rights in the sense of international courts, welfare system (basic infrastructure, free/cheap water/education) ... They are very nationalist. Something also unique to super powers.<p>That may sound like something bad, but it seems to be a necessity to keep big societies at least somewhat stable. History has shown that.<p>I might be missing something though, so please tell me how Russians suffer more than people in another (non-scandinavian) country.<p>I agree on the oil part. Gas too. But again compare that with other countries, the US goes on war for oil and gas, pressuring Europe via imports. I agree, Europe being more independent from such things would be a good thing.<p>It seems that a lot of the bad stuff in countries depends a lot on their age and actual size. China is the oldest and population wise biggest country, requiring the most control for stability, having the most troubles, followed by India with slightly less population, but big age, less control, but therefor way bigger problems, followed by Russia and the US, where the US has a bigger population, but is also way younger than Russia.<p>Russia is a lot like the US with a big tea party. I guess that&#x27;s their main problem, but then even with Putin it was just as much of an up and down as with Bush and Obama.<p>I just really don&#x27;t think that things will change so quickly, neither in the US, nor in Russia. However, I think they are doing an equally good/bad job in regard to their current circumstances, making the US a better place to live, but maybe not too much. A liberal movement in Russia, pushing Putin into one direction and a stronger tea party with a republican president in the US could change that.<p>Even though both countries are rivals they don&#x27;t seem to be that dissimilar, just US having a couple of benefits (world language, winning various wars in the past century, ...).

8053614,comment,8052957,8053420,2,0,jerf,,,"Programming is deeply and inextricably mathematical.<p>However, most programmers don&#x27;t actually know mathematics, so it&#x27;s difficult to see that. This is further exacerbated by the fact that people creating APIs and libraries also don&#x27;t know math, so they don&#x27;t see it, and consequently design APIs and libraries that don&#x27;t show mathematical characteristics. (This is not because they are &quot;better&quot;... it just means that mathematically these libraries and APIs are mind-bogglingly large and complicated objects, instead of simpler and more powerful ones.)<p>Schools don&#x27;t teach much math. Non-zero, but not much. Even a computer science bachelors degree teaches only a smidge of math, and not enough to learn how to correctly apply it to real code.<p>If you&#x27;re not doing proofs in school, you aren&#x27;t doing math in school. I do not mean that all math is proofs or that only proofs are math; I mean literally what I said... if you are not doing proofs <i>in school</i>, you are not doing math in school. (If you get up to post-grad this can change a bit, but pretty much all that is available to bachelors students are in these courses.) You can use this as a yardstick to see how much math you actually know; if your proof experience was confined to just one or two classes where you begrudgingly wrote a few proofs, you don&#x27;t really know math, and, well, probably shouldn&#x27;t be arguing about whether programming is or is not this other thing that you don&#x27;t even <i>know</i>. Memorizing a series of legal transformations of equations with perfunctory walkthroughs of their validity by a disinterested professor is not math. It&#x27;s calculation. If you&#x27;ve observed to yourself that a computer could well do that... well, yes, they could. Computers remain fairly bad at math but they&#x27;ve got us creamed on computation, even symbolically. The calculation you learned is not math.<p>Math is about building systems of axioms, building on those axioms, learning what you can and can not guarantee, how to maintain those guarantees, how to build big things based on those guarantees. Safely refactoring code while maintaining its behavior is math. Building an API with simple primitives that can be <i>safely</i> combined to obtain various useful effects is math. Compilers are big piles of math about graphs and nodes. And I could go on and on. Pretty much every program I write is a simultaneous exploration of what the simplest primitives are that I can write and the operations for safely combining them, and this includes even brutally practical systems like process monitoring or memory pools.<p>To the extent that the average developer&#x27;s refactoring is generally not safe, that indeed the language itself probably doesn&#x27;t even <i>permit</i> truly safe refactoring, that most APIs are not built around simple, powerful, safe primitives, that most &quot;compiler&quot;-y code is a big pile of hacks, and so on, that doesn&#x27;t show programming isn&#x27;t about math. It shows that most programmers are bad at the relevant math, often to the point of complete ignorance that math is even involved, indeed often not even knowing the relevant <i>words</i> for the basic things. Consequently, yeah, they argue that programming isn&#x27;t math. It is. They just don&#x27;t realize it because they lack the skills.<p>This is not targeted specifically at the original author, BTW. &quot;Programming is not math&quot; is a widely shared opinion.",1405697882

It was difficult to get a bank account and rent a flat without references or fixed address (I stayed in a hostel the first few weeks).<p>I once got evicted from a flat (with 10 days notice) because of a legal loophole. The landlord was insolvent, bank repossessed, my tenancy agreement was declared void because landlord hadn&#x27;t sought permission to let it out from the bank. As a tenant, you have no way of checking this upfront. Generally tenants are treated like shit and you need to be really wary. I was ignorant of any of this until it smacked me in the face - now I&#x27;m sufficiently up to date to give tenancy advise to the natives.<p>Compared to Germany, recycling here is barely known, which took some getting used to. You can&#x27;t get a proper sausage in this country, but there&#x27;s new exciting foods to compensate for it, and a wide variety of popular foreign dishes.<p>Other than that I like it, apart from the worrying rise of xenophobia, anti-EU sentiment and increasing internet censorship and monitoring. There&#x27;s always Scotland though, after the breakup.<p>> What is your particular career?\n> Did you have to already have a job when you moved to that country?<p>I was offered a job as CTO, which was the opportunity to move I needed. If you do not have an offer letter in your pocket, it will be even more difficult to get a bank account and rent a flat (but search for &quot;HSBC Passport&quot;).<p>> What were your moving expenses?<p>A flight for me, and a couple hundred euros to transport a few of my most important belongings. Do not bring more than this. Definitely don&#x27;t bring furniture. Do not bring bed sheets or anything that is sized to fit certain items of furniture, it will not fit.<p>Then the price of a few weeks of temporary accommodation while I searched for a flat. I went cheap (£40 a night) because I wasn&#x27;t sure how long it would be for, and ended up in a hostel where the shower didn&#x27;t work reliably. Found a flat after two weeks.<p>> How much is your rent or did you buy?<p>Rent in the UK is obscenely high, and so is buying (especially in and around London), and one of the things I still struggle with is the generally poor quality of available housing (ancient heating, drafty single glazed windows, &quot;period&quot; buildings).<p>> Have you become fluent in the native language and was the language barrier difficult to overcome?<p>Yes. I spoke English before, or thought I did, but the language barrier was still immense. English has many variations (I ended up in a meeting with an Irishman and couldn&#x27;t understand a thing) and there&#x27;s a lot of slang in use. It took about a year before it got acceptable, and after 5 years I can cope with almost all of it, including Glaswegian and Scouse.<p>> What was the process like to become a permanent resident?<p>Depends on where you come from. After a few years of legal residency, you can apply for naturalization and do a test that every person born in the country fails (but you just study for it and then you&#x27;ll pass). As EU resident, there&#x27;s no huge advantage in becoming a citizen (well, you get to vote if you like).<p>> What&#x27;s the cost of living compared to where you moved from? Has your quality of life improved or not? How and why?<p>Considerably higher cost of living, all due to the high rent (other factors about the same). I&#x27;m not sure about quality of life, but I can tell you it was the most important thing in my life and everyone should live in a different country for some time (actually live there, holidays don&#x27;t count).<p>As American, please consider that you will be made fun of by some, you will need to learn how to drive on the wrong side of the road and how to use a stick shift.<p>In general, be prepared to accept that things aren&#x27;t like home and miss some food.",1405697711

Amazon is still trying to drag book publishers into participating in this, and hasn&#x27;t had much luck yet. Video subscriptions are more miss than hit. Spotify is the most mature, and (by your estimate) only has 60%-70% of what you want. And there&#x27;s all kinds of complaints that Spotify doesn&#x27;t result in the same kind of income that record sales did. I don&#x27;t think the companies that own the products <i>do</i> like this model.<p>The reason they do it at all is because it&#x27;s an effective way to compete with illegal downloading. The $10/month doesn&#x27;t represent the actual value of the product (which for me at least is probably higher), but seems to represent about what the market will tolerate before it goes back to just torrenting stuff.<p>And that brings up a really good thing about these services: they address the market-efficiency losses of the copyright regime without needing to either break the law or change it.<p>For example, suppose the only way to get an ebook is to buy it, and each book costs $X. There are a small number of ebooks you value at more than $X, you buy those ones, and (in economic terms) positive value is created by each exchange.<p>But there is a much larger number of ebooks you value at more than $0 but less than $X. Those ones you would pay money for, and positive value would be created by that exchange, but the regime of &quot;sell each ebook for $X&quot; doesn&#x27;t allow that value to be created.<p>Piracy fully reclaims that value, but has its own problems. All-you-can-eat monthly services <i>also</i> fully reclaim the value (as long as you can afford them and they allow the use you had in mind), but in a way that is mutually agreeable to everybody involved. That makes them a good thing to have around.<p>The real problem you&#x27;re bringing up is that all-you-can-eat services don&#x27;t allow some good and important uses, like saving stuff for later. But so far I&#x27;m not seeing any indication that they are <i>replacing</i> buy-it-and-own-it services -- or that content owners have any reason to want them to.",1405697362

To make the same royalty from Amazon, I need to charge $40, but Amazon won&#x27;t let me do that. So I pulled my book from Amazon and revenues <i>increased</i>.)",1405697176

This selects for people with an affinity with novelty. You&#x27;ll probably see more programmers than the base rate when, say, a Nepalese restaurant opens in town.<p>I think programmers are still from a set of generation cohorts where being into computers from a young age was still a &quot;thing&quot;, something that wasn&#x27;t the default.

8053509,comment,8052957,8052957,3,0,munin,,,"as an aside it&#x27;s kind of interesting why there isn&#x27;t as much research on teaching programming as their is say on refinement types, separation logic or pointer aliasing. I think the reasons are annoying.<p>In academic research, nobody cares about education. The big universities that you think of as education powerhouses like Stanford, MIT, CMU, are all at heart research universities. Their faculty were not hired because of their skill as educators, but as scientists. In the training of research faculty (starting in undergrad through grad school and their postdocs) there is very little emphasis or formal mentoring or training on teaching students. Sure, you might TA a class, but this is usually seen as an inconvenience to be discharged as quickly and efficiently as possible, and some programs allow students to get their PhD without ever TAing a single class.<p>Why do they not care though? Well, educating undergrads won&#x27;t get you tenure or grant money or publications. These are all the yardsticks that we use to measure faculty success. Wait, don&#x27;t we use student evaluations? Oh sure, but you know what gets good student evaluations? Giving everyone good grades.<p>In a larger sense though, most don&#x27;t care about the study of education. Education research is de-prioritized and de-funded and education researchers and grad students are mocked for lacking intellectual rigor. Undergraduate education majors are not helping - walk past an undergrad education classroom and you could find college students creating paper mache volcanoes. No joke. Some of this is because education research is really hard, both scientifically and politically.<p>Politically, education research is undermined by everyone. If you are a researcher and you want to study how K-12 education works, for example, you obviously need the permissions of administrators and teachers at a school. Trying to get this permission will set off a powder keg. The administrators might be supportive, or they might think that your findings will be used by NCLB to justify shutting their school down. Teachers won&#x27;t be supportive at all, they will see your research as an attempt to gather data about their job performance, this will play into the hyper-adversarial relationship between administration and the teachers union, and you will never see the inside of a high school as an education researcher except on PTA nights. I&#x27;m pretty sure that nationally this research is not funded as robustly as say efforts to make robots fight with giant lasers because policy people don&#x27;t really want to know when their efforts are not working and the thought of independent and critical scientists studying the education system terrifies them.<p>So, as a young researcher, when you sit down with your adviser and say &quot;but nobody knows how our students learn programming&quot;, they will forcefully explain the way the world works to you, and &quot;suggest&quot; that you abandon this line of inquiry for something &quot;safer&quot;, something more funded, like perhaps an algorithm to detect cats in photographs on the internet. You can publish on that. It will help your career. Educating undergraduates doesn&#x27;t help anyone&#x27;s career.",1405697069

I don&#x27;t see this providing any real compression benefit.<p>For example, the byte 0xFF, which is the number 255, first occurs at the 1168th value of Pi.This means instead of storing 255, you&#x27;re now storing 1168, or 0x490, requiring an extra half-byte.  However, 0x328, or number 808, first occurs at the 105th value of pi, or 0x69, requiring one less half-byte.<p>How does this system provide better compression? The way I see it, the best case scenario would be if no sequence from 000 to 255 was ever repeated in Pi (or rather, not until every pattern in that sequence has been covered), in this case the compression ratio should be exactly 0%, no net gain or loss.",1405696636

You often have to live in walled off houses/compounds with a lot of security. Drink driving is very prevalent there and vehicle accidents happen all the time because of the electricity going out/how people use intersections. There is a lot of fear amongst people but much if it is justifiable, as everyone seems to have a horror violent crime story. Eventually, the limitations caused by perceptions and realities of crime make the actual world where you live quite small (certain areas, towns, streets, etc) and we found it quite stifling (for people from Ireland). Occasionally there are hints of the old racism (often black vs black these days). Also, the culture of everyone having a maid and how the poor are treated becomes very uncomfortable (felt a bit like 12 years a slave sometimes) if your not used to it. Bureaucracy is a bit of a  nightmare. Also the medium term prospects of the country because of the corruption now in the ANC don&#x27;t look great TBH.<p>Still, it&#x27;s well worth a visit, especially to the national parks, Cape Town, etc. If you get a chance go to Zimbabwe - weirdly that&#x27;s actually a country I would choose to live in over South Africa, as criminal (not political) crime is a lot lower and you feel much more free.",1405696243

The company pays their rent and usually tries to give them something close to what they&#x27;d have in their native country which could easily cost way more than they could afford on their own. Plus, since the company is paying it means an instant 20-30% raise since they no longer have to pay rent.<p>An example would be someone sent to HK, Tokyo, Singapore, maybe Shanghai. I have less experience with Shanghai but just looking at the services available it looks like there&#x27;s an &quot;expat&quot; crowd.

This recent interview with mathematician Jordan Ellenberg really piqued my interest though:<p><a href=""http://host.madison.com/entertainment/arts_and_theatre/books/q-a-make-friends-with-math/article_2da7c6f3-ba4c-5f02-8db3-b0fbc7e1d287.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://host.madison.com/entertainment/arts_and_theatre/books...</a><p>> <i>I would say that math, almost alone in the school curriculum, is the one place that you can create knowledge absolutely from scratch and know that you’re right. That’s rather amazing and I think that’s one reason math has a central place in school. If you’re taking history and someone says, “This is what happened in the Eisenhower administration,” you have to take the teacher’s word for it. If you don’t, you can look it up in a book and you compare that book’s authority to your teacher’s authority, but in the end you have no direct access to what’s true and what’s false. Math is different. In math, you can actually directly perceive what’s true and what’s false. You can count and you can measure and you can create that knowledge for yourself. That’s an incredibly powerful thing. If students come out of their math classes in school without really experiencing that, that’s quite a waste because it’s very special and it’s something only math can offer.</i><p>This, for lack of better term, <i>faith</i> in logical <i>proof</i>...that certain forms of analysis and problem solving can be built from and derived in an irrefutable way...that&#x27;s hard to get across to novice programmers...such as the idea that debugging is not just a matter of luck and randomness, no matter how complicated that stack trace or how you cross your fingers when turning on your computer, but of logical deduction.<p>Sure, everyone who is an adult goes through many years of math to graduate high school...but how much do they really appreciate that mathematical assertions can be, as Jordan puts it, basically created from scratch and be irrefutable? Which is something that you can&#x27;t say for many non-math topics that we run into day-to-day? And if you don&#x27;t have that grasp...even if all the actual math you do in your code is x += 1...you may not have the intellectual fortitude to deal with all the ways code can diverge and break.",1405696107

I can&#x27;t give much career advise as I&#x27;m not working, but there are tech jobs in oil and naval industries from what I can gather. Being from the US, you will need a job before you move. I didn&#x27;t have many moving expenses because honestly, I decided it was better to give my stuff away than to ship it plus I moved for marriage, so I had less to consider. Schools are good and higher education is free as well. The process seemed simple to get my residence permit: The most difficult part was waiting. I don&#x27;t get permanent residency until a minimum of 3 years: until then renewal each year, mostly a process of a form, an interview perhaps, and some waiting. We do rent, as do most people here - I think we are paying around 8,000kr ($1300USD) and that is on the cheap end - though I&#x27;m in Trondheim and housing is cheaper outside of the city. Everything is expensive - I gave up trying to convert to USD and just learned the economy like I would a game. Though the actual cost of living is more here, the quality of life I have is greatly improved. I can walk everywhere safely. Public transportation is excellent - not having a vehicle is definitely not all that restrictive. Healthy food is the cheap food and healthcare is universal. I&#x27;m not fluent yet. It is important to learn (I start language classes next month) but isn&#x27;t always required in some industries. Eating out is a rare treat because it is always expensive - but on the other hand, a good latte is cheaper than a bus ride. Yes, I do choose to walk with coffee instead of riding a bus at times. Nature is absolutely free - it is almost too bad I wasn&#x27;t more of an outdoors person.\nSome of these I&#x27;m sure carry over to other countries: I imagine most people don&#x27;t have dreams of living in the arctic, which comes with its own advantages/disadvantages depending on viewpoint.",1405696036

It puts up ads that users may (or may not!) click on. The clicking is the point at which the information transfer occurs, and it is voluntary and transparent. Or as transparent as it can be, anyway - if you are unaware of how the internet works when you click on a link, that does not make Google culpable for presenting said link.<p>The information Google has about the user is never given to anyone, least of all the ad buyers.",1405695644

The syntax is too heavy, because you need lots of function closures. The type system is too weak, because using monadic values without higher-kinded types is much more difficult and less useful.<p>The fact that everybody tries to import monadic values into their languages is evidence that they would indeed be useful; the fact that such libraries are always useless in practice and <i>incapable of even transliterating the Haskell</i>, and often fail to even implement the full feature set of monadic values in Haskell even if you&#x27;re willing to type reams of code, is why you don&#x27;t use them in other languages.<p>You don&#x27;t ignore monads in non-Haskell languages because the other languages are too powerful to need them, hurr hurr Haskell is teh weaks... you ignore monads in other languages because those languages are too <i>weak</i> to usefully implement them. If they could, you&#x27;d see them, and I am very, very confident over the next 10 years you&#x27;re going to see more and more languages coming out that really have and really use monadic values, because they will be strong enough to do so, and once you have that, the value proposition is just too good to ignore. They are too darned useful to ignore.",1405695623

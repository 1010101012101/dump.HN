Sure, it's not, The City(tm), but down town does have a lovely little, urban lite feel to it.  There are plenty of working class people and plenty of hackers in the area.  It's not the sexy place to live, but heck, for what people are paying for a one bedroom apartment up in SF, I'm getting a 4 bed/2 bath house with a yard and an office big enough for 3 people.  And, if I want to go up to Yoshi's and hear some really great jazz, it's only 80 minutes away.",1220687949

296658,story,,,15,34,cte,"Ask HN: How do you identify a great software developer in an interview?",,"Several young (fresh out of college) engineers on my team that I interviewed last year impressed me with their intelligence by way of excellent algorithmic thinking. On my recommendation, they were hired. However, several months into the job, they continue to ask trivial (read: stupid) questions, and don't seem to want to figure things out on their own. Yet other engineers, who I was not impressed by during our interview, have absolutely exceeded my expectations. They have the spirit of a hacker; they dig deep into problems, learn everything within our code base, and are invaluable contributors. How do I identify those people during an interview? Why do my intuitions seem backwards?",1220687771

I've yet to see an application where this has worked or will likely work. In short, rooftop turbines will not do what their promoters claim and often will cause their owners no end of grief.</i><p><a href=""http://www.wind-works.org/articles/VentilatorsandSquirrelsinaCage%20.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wind-works.org/articles/VentilatorsandSquirrelsin...</a><p><i>Like ducted turbines, a perennial favorite of hucksters and charlatans is, for lack of a better word, squirrel cage rotors. Many are nothing more than roof-top ventilators repackaged as ""wind turbines"". As ventilators, they work fine. It's when someone tries to couple them to a generator that they quickly learn why wind turbines use two or three slender, airfoil-shaped blades. Most hucksters, however, never progress that far. They never build actual wind turbines, and perchance that they do, they never measure the ""wind turbine's"" performance. Of course, they wildly exaggerate the potential of these breathtaking new inventions.<p>Doug Selsam, himself an inventor, has tried to understand why consumers--and the news media--are so gullible. His explanation: ventilators and squirrel-cage rotors are easy to understand, modern wind turbines much less so. After all, a roof-top ventilator with its entire swept area covered with blades looks like it will capture more wind than a modern wind turbine with only a few blades, some with--unbelievably--only one.<p>In a 2002 internet scam, a company peddling ventilators as ""wind turbines"" claimed their product would produce nearly five times more electricity than a conventional wind turbine of the same size. Naturally, for this ""superior"" performance they would charge 2-3 times more than for a real wind turbine. The company asserted that they were ""thinking outside the box,"" a catchphrase of 1990s management gurus. They certainly were. They were not even close to the box. They were on another planet where the laws of physics don't apply.</i>",1220686154

296643,comment,296158,296158,0,0,gaius,,,"I have a friend who's rabidly anti-Facebook, who says that if someone is his real friend they'll phone him (presumably a hundred years ago he'd have been rabidly anti-phone, his real friends would write him letters on parchment). What FB does it it lowers the latency and friction of interactions <i>that would happen anyway</i>. If I want to go to a restaurant, FB lets me know exactly how many I actually need to book a table for just before I call them. If I'm planning an event, everyone going gets a reminder and a map. If I want to send someone a (real) birthday gift, it's an address book that updates itself.<p>What it might change is the real meaning of the word 'friend', or what it implies - all you can tell from being FB friends is that you're in someone's contact list. It doesn't really supplant real-world relationships.",1220685916

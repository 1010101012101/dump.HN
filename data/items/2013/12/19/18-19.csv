It&#x27;s a command line app which prettifies the packets in a readable way.<p>* From the packets we can get a lot of info, like where the packets are going, what data the fields contain, etc.<p>* We can also intercept the packages and mess with the fields to see what breaks when we change things.<p>* From here we use smali to decompile the Android DPK. Since debugging symbols are left in, this leaves a lot of info for us to look at.<p>* We ctrl-F for words like &quot;encrypt&quot; and &quot;secret&quot;. This leads us right to the call to util android encrypt which is encrypting the images. The argument is a hard-coded secret string that turns out to be used everywhere.<p>* Looking through the source where that key is used we see that it&#x27;s also used to generate request tokens, which validate that a request to the API is valid.<p>* And so on.

This is unquestionably an expensive workstation, though considered in the context of competing products like those from HP or Dell, you&#x27;ll see that similarly specced PC workstations are in the same ballpark (though these dual-socket workstations make true apples-to-Apple comparisons more difficult, and it&#x27;s harder to quantify the value of real drive bays and PCI Express slots).&quot;<p>Whenever I&#x27;ve looked at non-cheap machines, independent of OS (I&#x27;m often flexible between macos and linux), the difference between an apple machine and something from another major vendor, for as closely-comparable machines I can find, is often a fairly small percentage.

We invited fifteen executives from across Silicon Valley for breakfast and a discussion about the economy. Secretary Geithner arrived with four members of his staff, two senior and two more junior, and we all gathered in our one nice conference room.<p>After the usual milling around, I encouraged the attendees to help themselves to the buffet and take a seat. Our invited guests, mostly men, grabbed plates and food and sat down at the large conference table. Secretary Geithner’s team, all women, took their food last and sat in chairs off to the side of the room. I motioned for the women to come sit at the table, waving them over so they would feel welcomed. They demurred and remained in their seats.<p>The four women had every right to be at this meeting, but because of their seating choice, they seemed like spectators rather than participants. I knew I had to say something. So after the meeting, I pulled them aside to talk.<p>I pointed out that they should have sat at the table even without an invitation, but when publicly welcomed, they most certainly should have joined. At first, they seemed surprised, then they agreed. It was a watershed moment for me. A moment when I witnessed how an internal barrier can alter women’s behavior. A moment when I realized that in addition to facing institutional obstacles, women face a battle from within.&quot;<p>In reading the book, I didn&#x27;t find Sandberg accusing women of not doing enough--like this article seems to imply. Rather, she&#x27;s pointing out barriers to women becoming leaders--barriers that we as women are probably not even conscious of. In that way, I found the book incredibly helpful.<p>I should note I was predisposed to not like the book based on articles I&#x27;d read, but I am a voracious reader and I wanted to see for myself what Sandberg was saying. The book opened my eyes to small but significant behavior and language changes I could make to be taken more seriously as a leader, and in that way, I am grateful.<p>If the article writer hasn&#x27;t read the book, I respectfully ask her to before dishing out criticism--if there is a valid point in the book that she is inclined to criticize, then I will listen with an open mind. But as it stands right now, I don&#x27;t find this criticism-without-citation productive.",1387479466

Though I think you might be better off just linking to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Sorting_algorithms\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Sorting_algorithms</a><p>I haven&#x27;t even gotten to his bits about floats and negative floats, which I will assume for now are very clever.  But his basic grasp of basic undergraduate algorithmics is a little... idiosyncratic.<p>The author defines &quot;radix&quot; incorrectly.  &quot;Radix&quot; is a synonym for &quot;base&quot;, in the sense used in &quot;base 16&quot; or &quot;base 10&quot; or &quot;base twenty six&quot;.<p>The author&#x27;s first pass at explaining radix sort (up to &quot;Radix sort is stable by the way&quot;) is not radix sort at all, it&#x27;s counting sort.  Admittedly, I suspect that any good explanation of radix sort will start by teaching some stable linear-time sort, probably counting sort (but alternately bucket sort).... but that doesn&#x27;t mean that they&#x27;re the same algorithm.<p>Then, up to the section marked Sorting Floating Point Values, he actually explains radix sort.  This part seems okay to me.<p>His analysis of the running time is atrocious... for one thing, he doesn&#x27;t distinguish between his counting-sort phase and his radix-sort phase, which makes it a bit hard to illustrate exactly where he&#x27;s being silly, but...   First, counting sort takes O(n * R), where R is the size of the range of input values (R is known as the &quot;radix&quot;, remember).  In his case this is implicitly 256, which he appears to equate to 1 (yes, they&#x27;re asymptotically equivalent if it&#x27;s always 256, but in my opinion 256 is a large enough constant factor to be worthy of note).  In a more general algorithm, this radix should be seen as a parameter of the analysis.  Of course, he indirectly addresses this in his section about &quot;extending to words or dwords&quot; (i.e. his section on actual radix sort), but it would be better to be explicit about it.<p>Further, radix sort does d passes, each taking O(n * R), where d is the number of digits and R is still the Radix.  What&#x27;s the largest value?  It&#x27;s around R^d.  So if you want to sort digits with a maximum of M, you need d=log_R(M).  If you assume that your range of values is at least as large as your set of values (you have n values, remember), then you need log(n) passes of time O(n), in other words it takes, on the whole O(n logn).  The only way to beat this is when you&#x27;re sorting values which live in a smaller domain than the value-set, like say this list:<p><pre><code>    [3, 4, 5, 5, 2, 3, 3, 2, 6, 6, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 6, 4, 3, 2]\n</code></pre>\n(that&#x27;s 20 values, each in the range 1..6)<p>Oh, and while I&#x27;m kvetching, he writes O(4 * n), which is just a weird thing to write.  It&#x27;s not technically wrong (since after all O(n) and O(4 * n) each refer to sets of functions, and the sets they refer to are co-extensional), but it&#x27;s a &quot;code smell&quot;.<p>So.  In summary, he uses a lot of sloppy terminology, is sloppy about separation of concerns, and fails to actually analyze the actual runtime complexity of his algorithm, except that in a special case he turns out to be coincidentally correct.<p>Also note, btw, that this article was last edited in 2000 (er, plus a footnote in 2007).

But I would be quite surprised if e-cigs <i>do</i> turn out to be harmful (enough to ban them). And it seems pretty much impossible to me that e-cigs would get even close to being as hazardous as tobacco.<p>With that in mind, I generally advise smokers to consider e-cigs, and I advise non-smokers to stay away.<p>I would love to hear more arguments against e-cigs though. I don&#x27;t feel a strong need to defend them, as I&#x27;m currently a heavy smoker and ideally I want to quit entirely at some point.",1387478962

6936719,comment,6900625,6932513,1,0,kindmatt,,,"I would respectfully disagree that the cost to mfg. a mattress is drastically different.<p>Your pricing is completely off. You can buy organic cotton fabric for as low as $6 that is 100% organic cotton certified by GOTS and you buy can knit fabrics for $12.  It isn&#x27;t that simple of a comparison. If you were in manufacturing, you would know, but it is easier to come up with a marketing gimmick.  Tuft and Needle buys from a manufacturer and resells it just like Sit &#x27;n Sleep, Mattress Firm, Sleepy&#x27;s, etc.<p>Why do you say “about 2 pounds” as the density?  This sounds like cop out.  You are probably using 1.8 and some 2 pound.  Be open and honest so people can make an educated buying decision.<p>You don&#x27;t agree that those are good comps.  How about these?\nA queen Ikea is $329 for 2.2 pound foam and a ½” thicker. (<a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00139813/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00139813/</a>) Where Tuft and Needle is $399 for a supposedly 2 pound foam.  Surprisingly, most IKEA mattresses are made in the US so don’t give the made in China routine on this.<p>Serta at Sleepy&#x27;s is $299.99 (<a href=\"http://www.sleepys.com/en/Sertapedic-Caine-Firm-Mattress_109310/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sleepys.com/en/Sertapedic-Caine-Firm-Mattress_109...</a>). Even if they were using a lower density, how could they be marking this 1,000% as Tuft and Needle states. Sealy has one that is 5 ¾” thick for $299.99 at Sleepy’s (<a href=\"http://www.sleepys.com/en/Sealy-Austin-Creek-Plush-Mattress_39601/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sleepys.com/en/Sealy-Austin-Creek-Plush-Mattress_...</a>).<p>Why is Tuft and Needle $100 more than the name brands which are made in the USA, too?  Don’t give me the density because like Sealy and Serta, Tuft and Needle won’t disclose density.  For sake of argument, let’s say Sealy uses a 1.2 pound and Tuft and Needle uses 2 pound foam.  There is 200 board feet in a queen mattress and the cost per board foot between 1.2 and 2 pound is 25 cents.   The added cost would be $50 in raw material.<p>This is untrue; “Tuft & Needle was founded to offer boutique-quality beds at a fraction of the cost. You shouldn&#x27;t have to overpay for a good night&#x27;s sleep.”  Tuft and Needle is nowhere close to a boutique bed.<p>Finally, prove to me that mattress stores markup the mattresses 500%.  If you look at Mattress Firm&#x27;s 10K Report, you will see that there GM is nowhere near that.  In 2012, they had sales of $1,007,337,000 with a COGS of 614,572,000.  That is a 64% markup.  No, sales and marketing are not included in this.  They spent 245,555,000 on sales and marketing.   Tuft and Needle needs to get the facts straight.",1387478526

I have no idea what you are talking about here. We round project commissions to the cent, like everyone else.<p>Automated bidding- we changed our system some time ago to dramatically stop bid spam. I&#x27;m not sure how recently you have used the site. We have removed &quot;public&quot; bids entirely. Now you can only leave one private bid, this has got rid of the problem you talk about.<p>I would have to disagree with you for disputes and support. We have the largest support team in the entire industry with 250 people in our own facility that operate 24x7x365 and speak 10 languages. We have a paralegal team doing disputes that I believe is the most sophisticated in the industry as well in terms of how it resolves issues.<p>Our business is going from strength to strength and we are the only company that is publicly listed, so our financials are transparent. Our revenue is growing at almost double the growth rate of our nearest competitors, so I would have also disagree about your comments about the state of the site.<p>Happy to answer any other questions you may have or you can email me directly at matt@freelancer.com.

(although the naming of results in Python is quite useful).<p>When I was at Google I started using Python to create a CMS of sorts for my toy website (robotics.mcmanis.com) which got to the point of being able to push some stuff but more complex stuff was a pain.

White males simply ask more. That&#x27;s what &quot;luck&quot; is here. Asking, then doing.<p>Among all those people I&#x27;ve had one black African ask me. I sat down with him for a while giving him tons of advice and corresponded a few times more after that until I got swamped by work.<p>I&#x27;ve had only one woman ask me (recently, just this past week), but only superficially. She had recently picked up a book on generative art because she fancies being able to do that. Ironically, we have the same exact book at the office because I work with one of the best generative artists in the Bay Area, Reza Ali, so I actually had some decent advice on where to start if she was serious. The conversation was shallow and brief before she got into general discussions about life with my girlfriend who was also in the room. It was simply a qualitatively different way of asking for advice which isn&#x27;t likely to lead to success. Not all women are like this, I know. But I only have on anecdote thus far and I&#x27;m disappointed by this. I&#x27;d personally love it if more women coded so I could nerd out about programming with both men and women equally.<p>The above are only anecdotal (and the plural of anecdotes is not data). Maybe I only have many more male white friends, but my girlfriend certainly does not and her friends are all aware of what I do for a living and I do have a decent amount of contact with them. Near as I can tell from above, the number of minorities that ask for help is roughly in line with base rates. The number of women who ask is not. Women are roughly 50% of the population. If they want to learn and do this kind of thing, they need to ask and then do. This definition of asking and doing for women is &quot;luck&quot;. Woman do not lack contact with people that can help if they just asked.<p>For minorities, it&#x27;s a bit more sinister in that luck also has an element of propinquity that is far more outside the control of an individual. A minority in a poor neighborhood in the Bay Area is unlikely to come in contact with me or someone like me, so they will never have an opportunity to ask. The guy in this posted article on the other hand does have the luck of propinquity. All he needs to do is walk up to Google employees either before or after his shift and ask a few of them if they are an engineer and if they can offer him advice on how to learn to do what they do. I&#x27;d be surprised if he didn&#x27;t get actionable advice that can get him out of the rut he is in in about 2-3 years.",1387477390

In the case of Russia, that may be the Orthodox Church, in the case of Iran, it may be Islamists, in the case of America, it could be the Catholic Church.<p>We set aside a purer democracy for the notion that all beliefs that do not harm others are allowed, and we have (in theory at least) protections that exist specifically to shield the minority from the majority.  While we don&#x27;t allow for the stoning of adulterers in this country (as that would most specifically infringe on the rights of those being stoned), we do allow for freedom of religion, even where that religion is Satanism, Islam, or any other religion that does not share the majority view.",1387476942

Doing rectangle intersections actually requires allocation, so drawing isn&#x27;t constant memory.<p>To speed up drawing we made the WM retain the draw ops.

Apparently the hardware connections were so sensitive that tiny bursts of static electricity through the air were enough to disrupt the whole setup.",1387476084

I think the most certain thing is that both iOS and Android are better off because the other exists. The competition has allowed for a lot of mutual copying, just as we&#x27;d seen in the PC market before it, and in just about every other technological development since the stone age.<p>Steve Jobs is justified in being angry because he feels ownership of his ideas. Is anger is held impotent because we recognize that a healthy degree of copying is good for innovation. Both of those are OK.",1387476063

I realise that&#x27;s not an exact science by any means, but it&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll generally hear if you give an iPhone and a <resistive touchscreen phone here> to Doe on the street. These are being sold to your average user. Being able to manipulate what&#x27;s on screen smoothly without any physical/cognitive effort or a stylus is what makes capacitive screens &quot;better&quot;.",1387476057

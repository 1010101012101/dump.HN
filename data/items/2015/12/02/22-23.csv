Plus, if one kite breaks you only lose part of the electrical output as opposed to a large machine going off line. I wonder if hauling the thing down by line and repairing it on the ground might be easier than climbing up a tower. I would think so but could be wrong. Of course a larger fleet of individual machines probably means more frequent (smaller) repairs so there is that. How high do birds fly?

That or you&#x27;re struggling to read more than one sentence at a time as a coherent thought. Do you realize that every sentence past the one with the word &#x27;crackpot&#x27; in it was a justification of that statement?<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem</a> says &quot;... is an attack on an argument made by attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, rather than attacking the argument directly&quot;.<p>So can we agree, at least, that I have attacked the argument directly, at length, and therefore the &quot;rather than...&quot; clause is not satisfied?<p>Moreover, even if you don&#x27;t agree with that: I have no obligation <i>not</i> to attack a person directly if it gets the point across faster. I am, after all, writing to the readers as much as gd1 - and if gd1 is truly irrational then I&#x27;m not particularly interested in trying to convince them of anything, nor avoiding offending them. And my attack (if you can call it that - I did say &quot;Really hard to not take you for a crackpot&quot;, which intentionally gives him a wide benefit of the doubt) was, I think, well-justified:<p>The definition of the word &quot;crackpot&quot; that I am reaching for is that of &quot;a person who believes absurd notions&quot;. That would be as opposed to &quot;a person who believes rationally justifiable notions&quot;. I called gd1 a crackpot because as a way of capturing the notion that they were not defending their argument via rationality, but by <i>insistence that it was correct</i>, and were (as I pointed out in my original post) <i>intentionally evading challenges to the argument</i> - but responding to things to that did not challenge it. These to me suggest that they had no ability to defend the argument (and I invited a proper defense), and therefore that they would be a person who believes an argument without rational defense, aka a crackpot.<p>So I posted the argument that &quot;gd1 is behaving like a crackpot for reasons A, B, C, D&quot;, and I listed the reasons.  We can substitute the phrase &quot;one who believes absurd notions&quot; for &quot;crackpot&quot;. Both the word and its substitution are derogatory terms - we can&#x27;t get around that. It&#x27;s a negative quality to believe absurd things.",1449096860

Is it size, weight, recoil, aerodynamics, or special radar requirements? The initial push behind removing gun systems appears to have been development of AA missiles and increased reliance on fighter escorts. Yet modern CIWS on sea vessels have become so effective against missiles that they significantly upped the cost and requirements of anti-ship warfare, to the point that a single missile fired at a ship is not expected to be successful. Given advanced enough CIWS (using directed energy in near future?) one basically doesn&#x27;t need stealth or other fancy/expensive/less reliable features.",1449096856

Generating the state is NP hard, verifying it is P (can be verified in polynomial time). The oracle output state is used for sequencing state (meaning the blocks and who gets to sign off on the latest block). So POW is an independently verifiable method of sequencing state among unknown signing members (i.e. the miners).<p>The Microwave Background Radiation is a perfect candidate for both NP state as well as universal (really, anywhere in the universe!) time keeping.

There are several reasons for that, the main one being that it makes zero sense for state transition to happen outside of the state machine which created that piece of information in the first place. An example of such a wrong implementation would be Ripple, where IOUs are being state transitioned by nodes who do not issue the IOUs in the first place. It&#x27;s like tracking IOUs on a huge Google spreadsheet, it makes no sense. All state should be stored and state transitioned on it&#x27;s own blockchain because the finality of the transition depends on the issuer anyways, and the blockchains need a common input/output based protocol for reconciling, sequencing, and verifying each other&#x27;s state.<p>The future is a bit like adding Git to a database and adding a cryptographic reconciliation protocol so the databases can talk to one another.",1449096150

But “markdown” — not the brand, but the concept of lightweight markup — is a work in progress still.<p>Just look at the list of “feature requests” on the CommonMark forum.¹ Pandoc’s Markdown supports lots of extra features from Github Flavored Markdown (GFM), MultiMarkdown and MarkdownExtra. John MacFarlane, Pandoc’s author, is also the author of the CommonMark spec. And while, eventually, the goal is to extend the CommonMark syntax with a sufficiently broad vocabulary of content element types, the focus now is on getting the basics right, speccing the edge cases, and defining standard parser behavior.<p>Meanwhile, there is AsciiDoc (which is a port of DocBook xml to lightweight markup), for more demanding use cases. And then there is also reStructuredText, and org-mode, etc. But the markdownish-style of syntactical sugar won the race, and while doing so, it will be the basis for a future lightweight markup language that will do indeed support not-dumbed down written content, with the full variety of nuance that offer the likes of TEI, DocBook, TeX, and will be fit to reproduce the akme of complex documents and typesetting, such as critical editions and technical manuals.<p>Until we reach that point, I bet on dumbed-down Markdown, and while doing so, can always add-in raw html ad libitum. The bulk of most written content, after all, is just headings and plain text, with a few emphasized phrases here and there, a link, an image. That covers <i></i>a lot<i></i> of use cases already.<p>¹ <a href=""http://talk.commonmark.org/c/extensions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://talk.commonmark.org/c/extensions</a>",1449095947

Dig up graves, ban speakers from visiting, sit ins to get people fired, hunger strikes by millionaires. It&#x27;s a cult of misplaced aggression directed towards a world that has always been difficult to live in, but is exploitable by the empathetic nature of our species. But believe me that exploit is being patched. Wolf has been cried too many times.<p>SJWs THINK they are making change. Reality is they break down morale, cause self-harm and accomplish zero for society. Sadly the press either eats it up, or is too stupid to understand what they are actually watching. But finally the press is back tracking by publishing these articles, which is how it will try to justify any sort of legitimacy.<p>And these movements attract the biggest whining losers and usurpers. Perpetual victims and that sort of weakness also makes the movements vulnerable to communist agents. You know the ones that show up from out of town with megaphones ready to take the group to whatever direction they want, chanting slogans against the protective and armed services, blaming the state of everything on racism or patriarchy. Taking any kind of personal responsibility away from people.<p>It&#x27;s a sinking ship, why you&#x27;d want to be identified with typical modern SJW movements is beyond me. It&#x27;s the kind of era where people head up ridiculous departments like &quot;diversity and inclusion&quot; which spawns fake credentials. Any kind of scholarship in sociology these days is found laughable. They are infecting communication departments now. Whereas communication degrees used to be you learned about audio engineering and operating telcom and media equipment, now you get one for watching documentaries and writing papers about protest movements. We&#x27;ve also just seen the skeptic community be infected by these losers.<p>The irony is the institutions in the united states are set up in favor of minorities. And that can&#x27;t be argued against. Which means yes there&#x27;s institutional racism but it&#x27;s against the so-called majority, not minorities. The kind of thing where if you have a private company over 50 employees you start getting visits by the government and threats over not having hired certain races. You can expect fines and worse because institutionally you are not allowed to hire who you want.<p>Any SJW worth a salt should be picking up their signs and heading to places where there&#x27;s real oppression. The institutions that have given into this mob mentality lose their credibility by the day especially with their larger donor base. They are an embarrassment to society.",1449094255

14724,comment,14663,14672,0,0,veritas,,,"I've been using rails a bit over the past month, month and half and just now getting a little comfortable with it.  I still slightly prefer PHP because even though it comes out ugly and takes more work, I atleast know what every single line of code is doing.  Rails has a lot of ""magic"" which makes things easier but at the same time hides a lot of things from a developer.",1177009104

14712,comment,14605,14683,0,0,jkush,,,"Yep. No matter how you phrase it, there are people out there who will never see how that might be true. I've said before that using the file system or caching data in memory isn't an anti-database technique, it's simply a solution to a specific problem. It won't matter though - someone will have a  fundamental issue with the approach, no matter how you present it. That's life.\n",1177007984

It is true that there is code specific for Rails(which kinda peeves me from my comfortable Ruby shell) but I highly recommend you learn Ruby first just to get the feel of programming in it. I must say coming from Java(ugh) programming is Ruby is such a pleasure. As long as you can think idiomatically then you're pretty much set!",1177006680

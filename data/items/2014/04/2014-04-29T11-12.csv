The implementation of a block list for certain domains seems to move sharply against that. Perhaps I missed the memo where it was mentioned that certain sites are banned from submission to HN. If a domain is getting spammed to the submission page then I can understand it being blocked but interesting stories/commentaries can centre around rubbish and abusive domains; I thought we [HN] rode above all that, that&#x27;s all.<p>Blocking low quality domains is a good thing to some extent, it&#x27;s just not being aware that&#x27;s how the site runs that makes it surprising/unnerving. Steering the site to maintain focus requires controlling the submissions accepted, of course; just I thought this was being done using flagging and upvotes [alone] in the open. Ergo, my reaction.

With this amount of parallelism, it becomes very difficult to keep all the threads busy, even for highly scalable programs. You&#x27;d get hit by all kinds of problems, like blockages due to memory throughput, or shared resources (IIRC the Niagara threads shared FPUs and other processing blocks, so to get them all running 100% of the time you&#x27;d have to manage the workload of your tasks insanely carefully)<p>On top of that, so much stuff just doesn&#x27;t scale well.

We carry this process a step further, omitting almost all features of the full language (including interfaces and even assignment) to obtain a small calculus, Featherweight Java, for which rigorous proofs are not only possible but easy.<p>> Featherweight Java bears a similar relation to Java as the lambda-calculus does to languages such as ML and Haskell. It offers a similar computational &quot;feel,&quot; providing classes, methods, fields, inheritance, and dynamic typecasts with a semantics closely following Java&#x27;s. A proof of type safety for Featherweight Java thus illustrates many of the interesting features of a safety proof for the full language, while remaining pleasingly compact.

We put hardened criminals into jails with other hardened criminals, which has many restrictions on your daily life, while keeping teenagers who just fucked up big time in prisons that are much less violent, and also keep the restrictions to a minimum. We even allow some of them to go out and to work together with normal employees at the end of their sentences.<p>We let everyone get an education or start an education while inside, too.<p>It costs a lot while the individuals are &quot;locked up&quot; but I&#x27;m very certain that it&#x27;s doing a good job, at least compared to other systems, such as the US one.<p>We do fuck up, though, putting hardened criminals into low security prisons, which lets them escape.

7666282,comment,7665690,7666141,4,0,leorocky,,,"It&#x27;s actually kind of an interesting thought to consider. If programming challenges aren&#x27;t good at helping you become a better programmer are they good for determining if you&#x27;re a good programmer? These kinds of sites pop up because of how the engineering interview is conducted. I presume that the more engineers study to become better at these challenges the less effective these challenges will be at finding good engineers.<p>For example, maybe you get someone who can find the right data structure or algorithm to solve puzzles, but will that same person understand physical limitations of computer hardware and networks? Will they know how operating systems and CPUs work? Stuff like CPU interrupts, processes, memory management are important. The crafting of software is important, being able to design maintainable architecture, understand important design patterns, cache invalidation, testing, different programming paradigms.<p>At the other end of the spectrum of what I think programming interviews do wrong is test reference knowledge. Stuff you can look up online by Googling. Maybe you can gauge some amount of experience by familiarity of having been exposed to enough of some type of thing to have ended up memorizing a lot of documentation, but I would say not knowing documentation that is easily searchable online is not a good indicator of a bad candidate.<p>In my experience bad hires have tended to turn out to be bad for reasons orthogonal to programming challenges and reference knowledge:<p>#1 people with a bad attitude.<p>This can take several forms: mean to others is the first one. But bad attitude can also mean someone who isn&#x27;t mean, but someone with a bad work ethic, calls in sick all the time, asks too much of others. Someone who is lazy or unwilling to learn from past mistakes and repeatedly breaks production code. Someone who doesn&#x27;t actually like to program but does it for the paycheck. Someone who goes off and codes things by themselves without input from others and creates a lot of work for others. Someone who is politically motivated in the workplace and strives to make themselves look better at the expense of others. Someone who is insensitive to women. Someone who is insensitive to diversity. Problems with integrity.<p>Only twice have I come across an individual who was a good person with a good attitude, worked hard, but wrote shit code. Both of these people had a masters degree in computer science and were excellent at interview challenges. They didn&#x27;t understand the code base, they wrote things that just didn&#x27;t work. They wrote just really sloppy, bad logic that you didn&#x27;t have to look through much to realize it wouldn&#x27;t work. One guy ended up on a performance improvement plan and then quit under pressure, and the other sort of just fell in as a probably permanent junior programmer who needed supervision, but with help ended up adding value.  His life though is one of very basic implementation of other people&#x27;s designs. I don&#x27;t know if he ever got better.<p>My point is, the modern programming interview fails in many ways. Still even I use it. There just isn&#x27;t enough time in an interview to figure out if a person will be good and enough. I also think 3 or 4 rounds of phone interviews and in person is too stressful and time consuming and anxiety causing for a candidate, and not worth it.<p>The best hires have always been in network hires. Hiring someone based on someone else you knew. Those kinds of hires didn&#x27;t even have formal interviews sometimes, you just knew they were good based on reputation. This also has problems, because maybe you just aren&#x27;t in a network so you can&#x27;t get hired this way, or maybe you&#x27;ve exhausted the network available to you and your employees when trying to hire.<p>Anyway, these programming sites are pretty fun.

7666271,comment,7666258,7666258,0,0,mqsiuser,,,"So I have been open sourcing the heart of a super expensive IBM software product, which IBM currently/today sells regularly for 100 tsd (Dollar or Euro, doesn&#x27;t matter much) per CPU core (discounts of 40% to 95% usually apply). This product is IBM WebSphere Message Broker or now IBM Integration Bus (IIB) and was thought to be IBM&#x27;s &quot;SOA&quot; offering. Let&#x27;s say mildly that SOA failed and unfortunately the remaining parts are not &quot;a lot&quot; (also not worth that much). I was in fact able to understand them and it&#x27;s been possible for me to open source the very most important parts in a POC. So the very most important part is the message processing and transformation language &quot;ESQL&quot;. IBM implemented it in c and I implemented it in Java. I called the project &quot;use-the-tree&quot; and open sourced it on github. A deployed version is online at www.use-the-tree.com.<p>Actually it turned out that I added a couple of improvements which makes my implementation superior to the one IBM has.<p>There are open source ESB&#x27;s and Broker&#x27;s, but I did not find (and I think it is unlikely that there are) comparable proper implementations.<p>I managed to work in this SOA trouble and Integration world for about 8 years and I am the contributor of important components to IIB which I open sourced as &quot;GenericESQLUtilities&quot;. My contributions are confirmed (by IBM Hursley) and by the community (on www.mqseries.net) and are actually used. Basically I proved that xslt is a performance disaster and on the other hand I showed how to properly do message transformation and processing. I also just implemented stuff that IBM didn&#x27;t know how to (implement), since they bought the product from another company (NEON) and certainly had some brain drain during that process.<p>Main areas of future work are (also documented in the git hub wiki):<p><pre><code>  - Add support for JSON\n  - Add all quirks that XML has\n  - Investigate if JavaScript can be used (instead of Java) (and implement it)\n  - Sorting (super cleverly with Tree Map ofc)\n  - On-Demand Parser (would be awesome, probably to hard for 3 months)\n  - Investigate on open source solutions for parsing flat files standards like EDI/EDIFACT or HL7/ORM formats and it&#x27;s usability together with use-the-tree\n</code></pre>\nThe project is very new (a couple of weeks old), it&#x27;s a POC and there is nothing in production. Though it is confirmed to hit the point.<p>So... I have already successfully contributed to open source (in this area) and there is constant change in the IT world (I see a clear decline of SOA and a push towards open source), so that I think that this project can have a significant success in the future. Again ... &quot;use-the-tree&quot; is the only thing which is left of SOA if you remove all the bad parts or the ones that have just failed... it is &quot;SOA - the good parts&quot; :). It provides strong guidance on how to do message transformation (to end up with the most efficient transformation code) as opposed to IBM&#x27;s approach, which is &quot;we provide you with every possibility and you better choose wisely&quot;.<p>Xslt would look like it, if xslt would be done properly.",1398771714

Herbalife had/has a pretty substantial pyramid scheme component to it.<p>Groupon, IMO was a trend. Trends have a ballistic trajectory. The reports of hard selling and unhappy customers confuse the issue, but I think the heart of the problem was that Groupon was popular for a while and now it&#x27;s less popular.<p>Our default business systems don&#x27;t know how to deal with that kind of a thing. A company with a 2 year half life. All our financial systems and our valuation of companies are built around companies that are lang lived, practically immortal (in the sense that impacts net present value). But, not everything is like that. A film or a computer game is often produced by a firm that forms and the disbands to create a single thing. It has all the things a normal company has: employees (including some highly paid stars), investors, assets, liabilities, etc. It only exists for a short time.<p>Crocs was like that too. A product that made a splash, sold a lot of brightly colored shoes at a great margin and then contracted.<p>I think the problem with Groupon wasn&#x27;t Groupon. The problem was the whole system trying to treat it like Strabucks when it was more like Star Wars. Star Wars wasn&#x27;t a failure because it stopped making money..  ..wait. Bad example. Exceptions prove the rule.<p>Financially, a company is the NPV of all its future cash flows. In practice, the system assumes those cash flows will continue steadily forever, growing if the company is healthy. If they try to swallow a company that will exist for just 4, they choke.<p>I think we need to be on the lookout for things like this. The world is getting fast paced. Maybe we need to be able to deal with 4 year companies.",1398770345

7666142,comment,7662584,7662584,4,0,netcan,,,"I&#x27;m a little torn. On one hand, I have an aversion to things like this being done in law. It seems wrong to limit people and it makes sense to me that some people would prefer to work 40 hour weeks or 50 hours every other week. I&#x27;m not extremist in these regard or a libertarian by most definitions but I do see an inherent bad in coercion like this. It seems to outlaw so many potentially win-win arrangements.<p>OTOH, I think the dynamic in labour economies is such that it doesn&#x27;t seem to correctly value employee &quot;surplus.&quot; I do think that empirically it&#x27;s hard to ignore the fact that regulation of labour markets has had successes, some of them very important. I think most employees would be worse off without labour laws.<p>Labour economies (maybe norms is a better word) seem to be much more influenced by &quot;cultural&quot; forces than &quot;economic&quot; ones. If this market was functioning in a healthy way, I would expect to see much more variation in arrangements and less standardization within companies. I believe there&#x27;s an explanation to be found in Ronald Coase&#x27;s &quot;The Nature of The Firm&quot; (1937 Economics paper), but I don&#x27;t have a mature enough idea to be able to boil it down to an HN comment.<p>Laissez Faire vs labour laws aside, I think that the notion that the number of hours we work today should be lower than 20 years ago is reasonable.<p>In an increasing number of jobs more hours doesn&#x27;t mean more work gets done. For a shopkeeper, dermatologist or factory worker, output per hour is fairly fixed (and transparent). More hours = more work. For a graphic designer, policy analyst, medical researcher or social media manager the relationship is fuzzier. Productivity varies a lot and shorter days can boost productivity. At the same time, worker productivity is opaque and a &#x27;last person at his desk&#x27; culture often develops with employees trying to demonstrate their commitment. We are shedding the first kind of job and adding the second.",1398769309

The skillset is quite overlapping... artificial time-pressure, artificially contrived problems, cleverness is rewarded, etc.  (But it&#x27;s not entirely the same, because programming contests don&#x27;t give points for half-working answers).<p>Also, IMO the best coding contest site is <a href=""http://code.google.com/codejam/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/codejam/</a>, because:<p>1) GCJ has unusually clear problem statements.

7666139,comment,7663845,7664283,1,0,mnw21cam,,,"Prison has three purposes. These are deterrent, rehabilitation, and protection of public.<p>In the UK, it has been recognised that the deterrent part of prison is actually quite weak. It is not effective for crimes of the moment, where the perpetrator is not thinking clearly. It is also not very effective for career criminals, because the proportion of crimes that are actually caught, prosecuted, convicted, and attract a sufficient sentence is quite low, and many criminals do not believe they will be caught. It is also not effective for those who commit crimes out of desperation, for instance to fuel a drug habit.<p>That leaves rehabilitation and protection of public. Truly dangerous criminals are sentenced to life for the protection of public.<p>In terms of rehabilitation, officials regularly promise that this aspect will be made more effective, but there are very few prison schemes that actually improve the long-term behaviour of a criminal. Likewise, drug treatment often takes longer than the prison sentence that the typical drug user is given. The magistrate&#x27;s blog at <a href=""http://magistratesblog.blogspot.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://magistratesblog.blogspot.co.uk/</a> has regular grumblings about this. In the UK, some prisoners are effectively sentenced to prison for a certain time, but must show that they have attended a treatment programme before being released. There was some trouble recently when some prisoners complained that they had not been given the opportunity during their fixed sentence to attend such a programme.<p>So, of the three effects of prison, deterrence in the UK is seen as the least useful.",1398769284

While the arguments listed are valid user interface design points, the ""flick to TV"" just works (assuming you have the right hardware), and it's pretty simple. If you wanted to get everything correct, you'd probably end up with a more normal user interface with buttons and whatnot, plus you'd spend more time developing it to get it right according to how you're supposed to be doing it.<p>Instead, they went out and developed a neat little feature that yes, has its problems, but it works and it's a little more innovative than a button-based interface.",1346756348

Sooner or later that kills the whole system.<p>There are somethings that you need to think about his statement- Which is-<p>>Today I heard on the radio that sa government worker is retiring with a pay of $301,000 pension FOR LIFE. Yes, that guy owes his success to government as I can almost guarantee you that he did nothing to have earned or deserved that pay.<p>Right there you see what he is trying to point out. Among all people who are retiring. Some might be exceptionally good performers, some exceptionally bad, some mediocre. But all are paid equally. This directly means some of them are paying up and working for others.<p>Next you say:<p>>>Don't you think it's ridiculous that you've picked a guy earning a government pension at $301k a year and you're castigating him, when there are loads of people in the private sector earning up to tens or hundreds of times more than that?<p>If they are making it from their work, its theirs. That's totally different than the pension argument which I mentioned earlier, where a few people pay for everybody else. Thereby there is no incentive for actual hard workers to do their work as they want. Why the hell should anybody work so hard ultimately only to find he and the guy who did absolutely did no work at all get the same rewards?<p>>>You could find people on Hacker News that make that much writing iPhone apps where people pay to click on pigs, or who figure out new ways to make ads harder to avoid.<p>You can't decide others taste on what they consider valuable.",1346756255

4473991,comment,4473522,4473965,18,0,cortesi,,,"Have a quick read through the posts linked in the article this story points to. I show that using just a UDID, you could access the user's geolocation, games they played, private messages and friends lists on many of the affected social networks, and in some cases (which affected millions of users) completely take over Twitter and Facebook accounts. This is with _just_ a UDID. Some of the companies I notified a year ago are still vulnerable today. And remember, I only looked at social gaming networks - small slice of the app ecosystem. I know that there are similar systemic issues in many other places. So yes, this is definitely a catastrophe.<p>Unfortunately, there's just not much an ordinary user can do. There's no way for a user to tell if an app accesses and broadcasts their UDID (if you're an expert you can use mitmproxy or a similar tool), and certainly no way to tell if the UDID is being used safely. I would recommend de-linking your social media accounts from all apps unless you know they're safe, but that's the kind of drastic advice that people tend not to take.",1346756016

I'm using you to soapbox about some data/scaling misconceptions. This subject happens to be one of my foremost interests.<p>Riak (AP, HTTP interface) is just plain a pain to use. Don't use it unless you have very specific use-cases in mind for the BitCask backend or you know what you're doing (aka, don't have to ask open-ended questions like this, no offense). Riak is amazing at a constrained set of use-cases, and pretty awful at most other things. The vector clocks, conflict resolution, and awful AWFUL API and documentation are a goddamn atrocity. Might be cool if you really need the magical replication/clustering, but realistically Cassandra and ElasticSearch offer the same wicked-cool scaling. No multi-master replication in the community/free edition. THIS IS A MASSIVE PAIN FOR LARGE DEPLOYMENTS. Also, ripping data out of the fucker is a pain.<p>Hypothetically Riak allows intelligent conflict resolution. In practice, this is like getting your wounds reopened and salted with ritualistic regularity.<p>MongoDB is just sorta...""okay"" at a variety of things and especially things that can be done with sharding. Replication in MongoDB is a joke, as is the underlying infrastructure of i t. I use it as a stand-in for what most other people use an RDBMS for. I'm generally relatively disciplined, so I haven't paid the dire <i>DIRE</i> costs some people pay for being unhygienic with document stores. I've seen people totally trash their data in the absence of schematic enforcement. I wouldn't recommend MongoDB except to startups that I trust to know what they're doing.<p>MongoDB is especially handy for discrete/isolated user data and environ as its designed to shard. I'm not really comfortable describing MongoDB as being designed for denormalization because that's not really true. My real metric for denormalized data is Hadoop/HBase/Cassandra, and MongoDB totally shits the bed after the documents get past 16mb IIRC. The limit used to be 4mb.<p>Oh and by the way, don't take MongoDB or Riak's ""map-reduce"" support seriously at all. Just don't even bother. Pretend they don't exist.<p>HBase and Cassandra are both more solid than MongoDB and easier to use than Riak, they're more specialized than MongoDB though.<p>A few things to keep in mind:<p>Cassandra, when it first got open sourced, was frankly awful. It's actually improved a lot, to the point where it's no longer the intense pain point for Reddit and Formspring that it once was. If you need SRSFACE replication, truth-propagation, and tuneable consistency, Cassandra is your girl.<p>Cassandra is nominally AP, but allows tuneability to full-blown CP by all rights with ALL (it can otherwise use QUORUM, ANY, etc.). Cassie is conceptually simpler than Riak due to using timestamps rather than vector clocks to track state transitions. Hardcore database theorists will complain about this loudly. I remain undecided.<p>HBase is a bit simpler, but it's built on HDFS. This is, depending on your point of view, either a great thing or an awful thing. HBase is strictly a CP wide-column store. You can pretend it's Google BigTable, but that would be a dire mistake. HBase is equivalent to BigTable like Bangladeshi slums are equivalent to the Taj Mahal. Google's stuff is way...way better and, IMHO, contributes to the design being a lot more practical. It's my opinion that modeling wide-column stores and map-reduce frameworks on top of a distributed filesystem only works if that DFS is extremely top-notch.<p>HDFS is extremely <i>not</i> top notch. I'm still waiting for someone to leak the source to GFS or Colossus. When that day comes, I will probably cry tears of joy until I die of dehydration.<p>If you're using HBase or Cassandra, you're using a wide-column store. Cassandra is the more flexible of the two, HBase is more well-understood. Use Cassandra if you need AP/CP tunability, otherwise use HBase. Hadoop/HBase people are easier to find anyway. I <i>personally</i> prefer Cassandra.<p>Cassandra replication is more auto-magic, HBase is less auto-magic being built on HDFS. Cassandra is thrift-only, HBase is everything you normally get with the Hadoop ecosystem. REST, Java, Thrift, etc.<p>Cassandra is P2P, HBase is master/slave. HBase means finagling with SPOF Zookeeper nodes and all that other contemptible HDFS bullshit. Cassandra scales better. When Facebook built messaging on HBase, they smacked right into the usual HDFS ""feature"" that hits everybody with a large deployment.<p>Basically, they had to sub-cluster and shard the <i>fuck</i> out of it. That's a lot of work. Cassandra hasn't yet necessitated this. This is <i>typical</i> for non-trivial Hadoop/HDFS deployments. It's also a massive pain.<p>Have to wonder how Google is faring with Colossus in comparison. Hadoop is just so goddamn awful.<p>Example problem that works well in a wide-column store: storing and updating the 1,515,106 followers a single twitter user has.<p>You can use HBase and Cassandra as general-purpose data stores, but that's not really a good idea.<p>Realistically by the time you need the kind of scale either can offer, you've broken down your data/ops needs into discrete problems to be solved.<p>It looks like this:<p>""We need a work queue, job dispatch, and distributed filesystem for the OLAP...a wide-column store for tracking followers...a SQL database for payment information...a high-throughput cache for denormalized projections of backend data for the frontend...a sharded index for searchable data""<p>Not like this:<p>""Well. We used (MongoDB|Riak|Cassandra|HBase|Neo4j|PostgresQL) for our data and it sprinkled scaling fairy dust on our foreheads like good little catholics on ash wednesday and now our scaling problems are solved.""<p>I'm not taking questions unless you're in the bay area and offering beer.

I thought that was obvious.<p>Look, I'll say this again. You asked which of the two PythonDeveloper thought were desperate. It's pretty obvious that he meant the author of the essay about ""the thorium and nuclear advocates."" Now you completely agree that you are desperate. Why did you ask the question if you weren't looking for an argument? The non-argumentative one would be ""yes, I am desperate; Desperate that we as a civilization won't be able to survive.""<p>You think that desperate implies a sneaky agenda. It doesn't. Here are all the dictionary entries: ""1. reckless or dangerous because of despair  or urgency: a desperate killer. 2. having an urgent need, desire, etc.: desperate for attention. 3. leaving little or no hope; very serious or dangerous: a desperate illness. 4. extremely bad; intolerable or shocking: clothes in desperate taste. 5. extreme or excessive."" Notice how none of those imply a sneaky agenda.<p>Nor am I against reactors. I'm explaining, the best I can, why anything associated with nuclear power is viewed with deep distrust. Referencing work from the 1960s doesn't help. That's from the same era of researchers which downplayed the negative consequences of Operation Plowshare. The problem is that the public reaction against decades of official optimism, which deliberately deemphasized the actual consequences, cannot be easily overcome just by more optimism.<p>The only way to do it is to set up pilot plants <i>now</i>, redo the same sort of engineering project as the MSR but using the fixes suggested from that project (I believe KAMINI did that), and then develop a demonstration pilot plant which actually produces power, test out the entire lifecycle (including breeding U-233 from thorium), present all experienced problems with radioactive contamination, effect of fluorine on the pipes, etc. And above all, make that information available for public and expect rejection.<p>This work of convincing the public cannot be done in a single presidential term. It'll be at least 5 years just to get the full engineering data. Hence, I find the proposal that the President should use Roosevelt's bully pulpit to advocate the issues on a national scale at odds with what I think is the right way to actually do this.<p>Furthermore, you wrote ""When they finished a weeks work. They simply turned it off for the weekend and turned it back on the following Monday."" but based on <a href=""http://www.energyfromthorium.com/pdf/NAT_MSREexperience.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.energyfromthorium.com/pdf/NAT_MSREexperience.pdf</a> , they most certainly did <i>not</i> have a weekly work schedule. It does not appear that you are working from the primary or even the secondary sources to make the above statement. Is you're above statement meant metaphorically? As it, I interpret it as truthiness.<p>In any case, you are confusing the issues. TRIGA is safe enough that it can be operated by undergraduates, and it can also be ""turned off for the weekend."" I think it can even be turned off for lunch. While power production reactors are a different scale entirely. Can you tell me how much decay heat will come from a thorium MSR which has been generating 300 MW use for 6 months? Can that sort of power reactor be so easily shut off and walked away from?<p>I read that the MSR decommissioning costs were higher than expected. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten-Salt_Reactor_Experiment#Decommissioning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten-Salt_Reactor_Experiment#...</a> says ""the MSRE cleanup project was estimated at about $130 million"", including a possibility for a nuclear criticality accident caused by the U-233 remaining in the system. To say nothing of the ""one atmosphere of fluorine"" gas above the solid salt. Are those costs and problems amplified in a full-scale commercial power plant?<p>And if you want to talk about alternatives to light water reactors, then one should also look to pebble bed reactors. Wikipedia quotes Richard Muller as saying they are ""in every way... safer than the present nuclear reactors, and arguably safer than the global-warming danger posed by fossil fuels."" Now, where have I heard that argument before? Note that PBRs had problems which were only identified by building reactors, and more PBRs have been built then thorium ones. Why should I presume that thorium MSRs won't also have problems?",1346754319

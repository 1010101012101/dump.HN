In doing so, you've flipped your pros and cons lists, but you haven't solved the actual problems.<p>Heroku is a PaaS cloud platform. Zero server awareness or maintenance. An app only environment.<p>You would have been better off using an IaaS cloud, where you have to rent instances and install apps, but you still have the benefit of instant, (potentially automated) scalability, intrinsic high availability and minimal maintenance.<p>Instead, you're renting physical servers which often have a long term commitment, can potentially drop off the air for any reason - such as drive failure, power supply failure - and then you'd have to rebuild.<p>I think the cloud almost certainly is for everyone, but you need to use the right kind of tool for the job.",1338681306

They've publicly stated that their primary reason for AWS/etc was simple the lack of operational complexity that was needed to manage it. Even given that argument, the cloud at a point becomes just as complex, if not more, than just running servers.<p>One thing that's helped Disqus out is the fact that we can get ridiculously powerful servers to ease the burden of needing to scale out (horizontally) right away.

My traffic might double because Apple released a new firmware, or might go up 10x because someone released a jailbreak without warning me. That capacity requirement quickly trickles down and settles to its original levels over the next two months until it spikes again.<p>Netflix is in a similar position: you never know when A&E runs a new documentary making everyone suddenly want to watch this one specific old movie at the same time, or when a trailer for a sequel hits during the Super Bowl and when the game is over everyone is inspired to watch the original.<p>Some businesses thrive on environments where capacity planning 24 hours in advance is impossible, an where holding excess capacity seven days later might mean 10x the costs of running your business. Claiming that these people are incompetent or couldn't possibly have profitable businesses is ludicrous: the cloud isn't for you, but I /love it/.<p>Btw, the extreme irony is that your entire business model works because your argument is often false. Most of the small blogs I know use DISQUS not because it does something cool, but because they only get traffic randomly based on events they have little control over: Apple announces something, to take advantage of it they write an article about it to be published an hour later, and then their site which normally gets no traffic suddenly needs to handle insane load.<p>Your cloud-hosted (to be clear, not necessarily that you host it in the cloud, but that you are a cloud to your users) comment engine solves that problem (as well as adding similar deployment advantages and simplicity that is also known from cloud hosting).<p>(Note: for those who want to heckle me ""your service falls over when jailbreaks come out"", it doesn't: the third party repositories do. The core site, the payment processing system, and my repository barely notce, and when they do it is normally due to a bug that I rapidly notice and fix, and tends to have limited effect.)",1338680733

They'd only have to wait until you log in legitimately and compromise your account at that point.<p>Real security against compromise of the device you're using to access a service, whether the 2nd factor is a hardware token or generated from a seed stored on an android/ios device, would require making every significant action, not just logins, re-prompt for a token.  I haven't seen many systems that do that, because it harms usability.<p>I'm not disputing that there are cases where RSA tokens or other hardware solutions make sense, but the physical burden of more than a few hardware tokens would be too much for normal people, even if cost were no object.  2-factor totp/hotp oath auth is far better than 1-factor auth, and presents minimal annoyance to people who already have their smartphone with them 24/7.  It can be deployed on every saas website with minimal additional burden to users.<p>A compromised android/ios device that you use to login to services is, as outlined above, pretty close to game over even if you have a separate hardware token.  An attacker may not be able to maintain access, but the account information and various settings can be compromised in an instant.  2-factor of any sort pretty much solves the password reuse problem, and also the problem with individual service passwords getting compromised somehow in a way other than an ongoing compromise of the user's machine(s).",1338680575

4059522,comment,4059298,4059407,69,0,Gatsky,,,"I was at the announcement of the trial data by the investigators this morning. The results were also discussed by a statistician not involved with the trial directly. Not sure that hacker news needs an in depth analysis of the trial design and outcome, but anyway...<p>In summary, the trial looked at patients who had incurable prostate cancer that had spread and stopped responding to traditional hormonal treatments. Patients had to have no symptoms to be enrolled on this trial. The trial compared abiraterone, a new type of hormonal treatment plus steroids to just being on steroids alone. The question that the trial was asking can be framed as ""Does taking abiraterone prolong the period of time that a patient can be symptom free and their cancer is under control?"" That was the primary endpoint. A secondary endpoint was survival, or how long they lived.<p>Built in to the study design was a planned interim analysis of the data. Normally, the investigators are not allowed to just look at the data as it accrues continuously because it creates bias. It is a standard approach to allow one look at the data when say 40% of the expected events (in this case, development of progressive cancer) have occurred. When they did this, the difference between getting the drug and not getting the drug was considered big enough to unblind the trial. This means that everyone finds out if they were getting placebo or the real drug.<p>There are multiple reasons why one may decide to do this. First and foremost is that if the drug really works, it would be unethical to leave people on a placebo for long periods, because it is clear they have an inferior outcome. Stopping early also speeds the time to drug approval and market entry for a given indication.<p>There are somewhat esoteric statistical procedures that can determine at an interim analysis if the accrued data shows a statistically significant difference between groups, which would therefore justify stopping the trial, while adjusting for the impact of repeated testing on the type I error rate (ie the chance of finding an association that doesn't really exist). In this trial, there is no doubt that the primary endpoint was positive and clinically and statistically significant, even with only 40% of people on the trial having had a progression event. So they stopped. The data on  whether abiraterone reduces the chance of death are not mature, because not enough of the people on the trial have died yet, so those results will be awaited. Stopping early means that these results may be biased however, because the trial is no longer blinded.<p>This was a large and well done trial, that employed standard statistical practices.",1338679663

Even better, technology improved considerably to bring us low-cost SSDs which wouldn't have been possible at the start.<p>- There was no way we could manage these servers and a datacenter without a dedicated network engineer and an SRE.

Also, you've spent a lot of time on your engineering interview process and you have it down -- now do the same for two more positions that you know much less about.<p>- There is a huge engineering cost to moving off and building your own tools. Two servers? OK. Two thousand?

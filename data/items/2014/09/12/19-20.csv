It is the difference between patenting the concept of &quot;sorting&quot; and patenting a specific sorting algorithm; only the latter is allowed. The conceptual test for patentability of an algorithm in most countries is that it is directly reducible to practice as a novel electronic circuit design.<p>All patentable subject matters are directly describable with math in exactly the same way as proper algorithm patents, and chemical process patents have an identical abstract structure (just change &quot;bits&quot; to &quot;atoms&quot;), so any specific argument against algorithm patents would consistently apply to most or all patentable subject matters.",1410551630
8310083,comment,8307834,8309346,4,0,innguest,,,"Thank you for the thoughtful response. I agree with your points, including your elucidation of dragonwriter&#x27;s reply.<p>I&#x27;ll try to clarify my point: before Uber/Lyft, we had taxis. Just taxis. Then, the argument went: &quot;Well yes, for taxis we need state intervention because if the government doesn&#x27;t regulate cabs then anyone can charge fare and conditions will deteriorate and it will be inherently less safe and...&quot;<p>Then Uber/Lyft comes around and all of a sudden the taxi market is &quot;relatively frictionless&quot; and has other &quot;unique characteristics&quot; that make it so beneficial to employees.<p>I&#x27;m trying to point out that there is nothing special about taxis. It is not a special market. I can&#x27;t deny that one to one business relationships allow for faster change in the market, as the employee can simply up and leave at any point.<p>The taxi market was the furthest thing from frictionless until competition started. The power will always be in the employees&#x27; hands so long as anyone is free to start competition. We see this with this selfsame example - before Uber, taxi drivers were basically employees to medallion owners (and taxis were supposed to be a regulated system for the free enterprise of starting a one-man cab company, not for the rich to buy all medallions and rent them). This is an example of failed regulation that allowed the current exploitation of taxi drivers. Competition is now allowing better conditions for those same drivers, even though there&#x27;s no pretense that Lyft drivers own their business. It&#x27;s an above-board operation and more moral than before, and not surprising that it works better for both parties engaged in this.<p>So what I&#x27;m arguing is that whenever we say &quot;but it doesn&#x27;t apply to roads/this/that&quot;, it&#x27;s usually because of the blind spots we have from looking at the system the way it is and being unable to imagine how else it could be.

8310072,comment,8309434,8309563,3,0,HillRat,,,"Unfortunately, &quot;inevitable demise&quot; is often more economically-rational than &quot;outside-the-box pivots,&quot; especially when talking about an organization the size of RadioShack Corp. The cost to pivot some 5,000 stores into an unproven, capital-intensive market that would require high-skill, high-cost employees would be far beyond the company&#x27;s reach, especially since RS is totally beholden to its lenders for any kind of strategic change (they nixed plans to shut down some 20% of their stores, for example, since the cost to get out of those stores was higher than the lenders were willing to bear). Instead, the most likely scenario is a fast bankruptcy followed by a faster closing of stores -- or a total liquidation of assets, in the worst-case scenario.<p>I call this the &quot;Blockbuster Paradox&quot; -- the idea that a corporation with a large investment in assets, employees and contracts is often locked into an unsustainable path by virtue of past successes. Just as Blockbuster wasn&#x27;t financially capable of disrupting its own business model, so too is RS incapable of a major pivot like the one you describe. After all, the maker market is a tiny fraction of the market for cellphones and personal electronics, and the company&#x27;s structure and finances are based on the higher revenue expectations. (The company needs a <i>minimum</i> of $800m in revenue per quarter just to break even.) RadioShack, with only about $30m of cash on hand, would die of asphyxiation long before it could ever become the kind of large-scale TechShop you describe.<p>Having said that, I would <i>absolutely</i> agree that RadioShack and the maker community have great mutual potential, just not on a large scale. RS could create a small number of flagship stores offering equipment, access and expertise, as a rebranding of the company back into a more technically-oriented market. (It can be argued that a central RadioShack makerspace could provide ongoing sales and marketing support for smaller, retail-oriented satellite locations.) But RS will need both a new strategy that can keep them around $4b in revenue per year, and a set of new investors that are willing to believe in them. That&#x27;s a very hard row to hoe.",1410551407

If illegal, no investor in his right mind would give us money. Unfortunately, the evidence I had at the time pointed towards &quot;illegal&quot; rather than &quot;legal&quot;:<p>1. There were lots of lawsuits. This Fox vs. TVEyes is not the first. We definitely tiptoed around TV groups so as not to draw attention.<p>2. The International Association of Broadcast Monitors (IABM, a group of regional services and some single-market self-employed folks) spent several hundred thousand dollars to try to get the law rewritten so that royalties would be set in stone, much like jukeboxes. Why would they do this if they didn&#x27;t all also believe it was illegal? In any case, the effort failed.<p>With this evidence in hand, I tried to grow the company organically, but it became untenable. We weren&#x27;t getting enough money from the single-market (or few-market) customers to fund the expansion. By contrast, Critical Mention was self-funded by a dot-commer, and completely ate our lunch. Even if we&#x27;d attempted to raise money, the fundraising sidetrack would have set us back by a few more miles and I had zero additional bandwidth. There really wasn&#x27;t a good answer to the question.<p>Ultimately, despite finding product-market fit almost immediately with this freshman business effort, I decided to pivot into a more &quot;legitimate&quot; business. I altered the tech to provide archiving systems for TV stations... and it went over like a lead balloon, cratering the businesses and leaving me with a pile of personal debt which took a couple of years of &quot;real world&quot; work to pay off.<p>Since then I&#x27;ve tried to start 2 more companies (huzon.tv and words4chrome.com) and while my execution and engineering skills have become vastly better, neither found product-market fit like the first.

The USA has a patent appeals court, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit [0], that takes all patent appeals nationally. The doctrine about &quot;do it on a computer&quot; patents will be formed by three judge panels chosen randomly from that appeals court, not by the districts.<p>But the very good sign from these cases is most were decided on the pleadings. That means there was no expensive discovery or claim construction procedure, much less a jury trial. A decision on the pleadings means that even in the best possible light, the patent holder doesn&#x27;t have a case at all according to the judge. There is no cheaper way to dispose of an expensive and lengthy lawsuit. And a rule that can be disposed of on pleadings is exactly what reformers wanted from the Supreme Court.<p>The CAFC has seen a few of these and so far Taranto and Hughes, two of the newest Obama judges, have acquitted themselves superbly. We have well written and conclusive decisions from them calling the whole &quot;do it on a computer&quot; mess ineligible.<p>We&#x27;ll have to wait and see how the more enthusiastic radicals for patenting everything influence the outcomes. Three judges that wanted to hand a monopoly on the centuries old, trillion dollar financial settlement industry to Alice even when no technological procedures were disclosed in their patent are still on the court: Moore, O&#x27;Malley, and Newman. Lourie was the swing vote in that decision and also says that Ultramercial [1] should have a monopoly on interstitial internet advertising because they wrote the century old idea up with &#x27;on the internet&#x27; tacked onto the end. There are eleven judges and one empty slot on the CAFC so those four make up a large minority that will likely press for &quot;on a computer&quot; patents to come back.<p>Chief Judge Prost, Judge Dyk, and the three new Obama appointees seem much more rational and good for our industry. We should hope they are the ones who shape the interpretation of Alice in the future.<p>And remember that while &quot;on a computer&quot; patents -- the ones that describe a conventional business and add &quot;on a computer&quot; or &quot;on the internet&quot; without anything added to known technology -- are falling, lots of damaging software patents are still out there and apparently unharmed. The h.264 and mp3 patents that block open and free media players and browsers are still functioning. The ZFS and JFS patents that make BTRFS illegal are still out there. The compiler and VM patents from IBM, Sun, and others that hang over the head of anyone who writes either still exist. The long filename patents and others that Microsoft uses to tax Android are still taxing. The UI patents on smartphones that drive the smartphone wars are still driving them. New patents on computer vision, deep neural nets, machine learning, GPU computation, multithreading techniques, and more are being granted every tuesday.<p>Lucky for us, software patents that are on actual software are a lot less lucrative than the ones on business &quot;on a computer.&quot; Even in smartphone litigation, most of the money verdicts depend on the shape of the box a smartphone comes in; don&#x27;t steal the idea of a rounded rectangle and your lawsuit will be for tens of millions instead of billions. Still, every kind of software patent is bad, dishonest, and harmful to our industry and progress.

Mails were also stored in plain files, but unlike mbox/Maildir all the metadata was stored as attributes, not in the files, making it easy to process them with scripts, or to sort them in the file browser.<p>Its a lot like the never-finished WinFS from Microsoft.<p>Funnily, modern file systems (extfs3/4, NFTS, HPFS+?) all support extended attributes in some form or another. However, they are currently only rarely used: Mostly for the &quot;this file was downloaded from the internet, do you really want to open it&quot; flag. I wish more programs would use them to store interesting metadata, but it&#x27;s basically a chicken and egg thing now.<p>Windows and GNOME also have concepts where you can have calculatable attributes - you have a little library that looks up metadata in a database or parses it from the file, and then serves it as an additional attribute on the file (visible in the file properties tab). You can see it e.g. on mp3s or word documents in windows. However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be widely used either, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if that function has been gutted out of GNOME lately.",1410550074

In a statically compiled language, all of the high order polymorphism eventually compiles down to actual, concrete code that should be expressible in hand-specialized C structs and functions performing a single, specific task.  Haskell makes that specialization process incredibly convenient and C makes it incredibly inconvenient.  But, the point is not to ship a bunch of production code quickly.  The point is to provide a low-abstraction example to demonstrate concretely what the compiler is doing for you without prefacing the example with &quot;Assuming of course that you have already studied Haskell...&quot;",1410549671

Some of the biggest startups (Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Homejoy, etc.) are building huge business models built on huge workforces of &quot;independent workforces&quot;.<p>If the trend continues, this could mean a massive shift in the US&#x27;s labor force from salaried jobs to independent contractors. A lot of folks in the Valley view this as a positive innovation, but I think this is a clear case where the free market is not going to work out what&#x27;s best for our society.<p>Imagine a future world where companies like Uber are the norm. A majority of the workforce will face issues like:\n* No regulation on working hours (i.e. the industrial revolution v2)\n* Massive healthcare costs born on the taxpayer due to lack of employer provided healthcare (i.e. going past what we already see with corporations like Walmart)\n* Lack of retirement benefits for the workforce as they age (401k, pension, social security). People may argue that the government shouldn&#x27;t force people to save, but what is likely to happen is that the taxpayer will bear the burden of supporting a lot of this population.\n* Lack of unemployment insurance which means that our labor force will largely be unprepared for the normal boom & bust cycle of our economy\n* Lack of worker&#x27;s comp which means that employee&#x27;s won&#x27;t be shield from low probability high risk events<p>The scenario feels like a deja vu; during the Industrial revolution, we hit a point where technology progress was leading to inhumane working conditions for manufacturing workers.

They were quite subtle about how they did it -- they would simply omit news about the bombs that fell short.<p>My favourite story is about Battle of the Beams (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Beams"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Beams</a>), where German bombers were guided by radio navigation. The British started broadcasting their own radio signals to make it appear to the German planes that the beam was slightly bent. It meant they could get the bombers to drop their bombs in the middle of nowhere.",1410548517

Only in hindsight, once the dust settles, will we be able to make sense of what&#x27;s happening and changing. We&#x27;re entering a new  kind of economy at a macro scale that the world has not quite witnessed before.<p>But the changes are happening around us, and I think this &quot;independent contractor&quot; model will be a big force during this new &quot;industrial revolution.&quot; Companies, empowered by technology, are trying to become more cost efficient, and in a short-sighted way, the single largest cost sheet for any company are its employees.<p>Personally, I think Capitalism as we know it will reach its limits once technology reaches a certain threshold of efficiency; we just don&#x27;t need as many people working the same amount of hours anymore.[1] (isn&#x27;t that the very definition of efficiency?) Then we as a society will need to figure out another way to live (new-style of feudalism? welfare state?). But until that new model comes in to play, and we&#x27;re in the middle of this new &quot;industrial revolution&quot;, the contractor model will be set to dominate.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/515926/how-technology-is-destroying-jobs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/515926/how-tec...</a>",1410548422

You make a point which is not stated to draw conclusions which were not made.<p>It states &#x27;Containers decouple your applications from the host OS, abstracts it and makes it portable across any system that supports LXC&#x27;. You can run the app in the container in any other system that supports LXC, isn&#x27;t that what decoupling is?<p>I think you are looking at this from a technical perspective and not an end user perspective. Why don&#x27;t you download and try some of the Flockport containers available on the website, those apps are decoupled from your Linux OS and will work in any LXC environment.<p>This is an article about containers for end users, not technical users, to help them understand the concept of containers and how LXC differs from Docker.<p>If security, multi-tenancy, running other OS&#x27;s or specific kernels are your core use cases, virtualization makes more sense as is stated a few paragraphs below that quote, and in the LXC getting started guide on the same site.",1410548410

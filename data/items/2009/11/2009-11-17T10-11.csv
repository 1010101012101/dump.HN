This interacts rather poorly with modern sites, which may well need to load 50+ files on a single page view.<p>Much of the YSlow recommendations center on various ways of getting around this limitation -- for example, using multiple redundant domains (images1.example.org, images2.example.org... permitting you to do 2*N downloads in parallel instead of 2), putting all your CSS/JS in one file, image spriting, etc etc.",1258455558

946228,comment,946075,946128,0,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"> Mono won't kill Linux. It just doesn't really matter, that's all. There are equivalent (or better) tools available in the open-source world.<p>Excuse the meme, but ORLY? Novell has done excellent work on Mono. Development tools for Mono are great. With Mono, you can actually distribute binaries and expect them to work on every distro that has Mono installed. And the best part? It doesn't look shitty like Java. IMO, there's too much frothing at the mouth in the FOSS world.<p>(On a different note, I'm glad I switched to OS X. The development tools are not great, but they're decent enough. Oh, and nobody boycotts anything.)",1258455206

946226,comment,945555,945555,0,0,flipbrad,,,"This has been a very long time coming though; so how many record deals made since this Act was passed will have ignored the end of a revenue stream 35 years from when the recording is made, and gone in at what will now be a loss? Clearly, accountants in the music biz will have been factoring/warning about this for ages. A timebomb? I really don't think so.<p>Totally aside, I really don't see the logic in saying that digital remasters are new works and warrant individual copyright protection. I don't know much about the process, but I assume that it's merely a transformation/reprint of an original recording, no?",1258454671

946221,comment,946075,946128,0,0,bad_user,,,"I'm really happy with this announcement. Microsoft is a trend-setter and whatever the reasons behind this ""opening"" it really sets a powerful precedent for future projects getting open-sourced by companies ... and developers/entrepreneurs that believe in the power of commons are wining the fight.<p>> <i>There are equivalent (or better) tools available in the open-source world.</i><p>No, not really.<p>.NET approaches the strengths of Java ... high-performance, lots of available libraries and tools, lots of programmers working with it.<p>Besides Java and C/C++, it doesn't have any direct competition, and C/C++ is a mess.<p>I'm working on a project right now in my free time. Because I do lots of number-crunching on large data-sets I just couldn't afford to do it in something like Python or Perl (my favorites) ... it doesn't have to be optimized, but it does have to complete in a reasonable time without me thinking about all the implications of every god-damn line of code I write. My server resources are also limited, my VM only has 2 GB of RAM / 2 cores with 1 GHz and I can't afford another server.<p>The only reasonable alternative for me is Java, but I hate Java. I tried porting my initial Python prototype to it and the results where awful. C# is very much alike Java, but its more bearable, and some stuff like Linq is just sweet. Not to mention that from within .NET I can also use Java libraries through IKVM.NET ... I'm already using OpenNLP through it.<p>And there are also people working on Python interoperability ... IronPython is great, and there are people working on Ironclad, an interface allowing to use CPython extensions (like numpy, that already passes 1100 tests).<p>> <i>Code just isn't everything</i><p>No, but the code + license is everything. The whole point of open-source licenses is that people and companies can't be trusted, and when you're really unhappy you can just fork.<p>I'm also happy with the design of many things coming out of Microsoft. I'm not happy with Guido's ideas or with many choices in Python's design ... I only prefer Python because of its large community and available libraries. If you think the community has anything to say about Python's future, think again ... there's always a core that sets directions, and any community is created through natural-selection ... people wouldn't use Python if they wouldn't agree with a majority of Guido's choices.<p>This is a good thing, please stop portraying as something bad.",1258454001

Then email in that ""THEY'VE EMAILED THREE TIMES AND HAVEN'T GOTTEN A RESPONSE!"".<p>That, obviously, is quite worrying. So you investigate as to why they haven't gotten a response by their fourth email, and discover that all were sent within 7 minutes of each other in the dead of night.<p>Yes, some customers are just too much fun.",1258453832
946218,comment,944290,945842,0,0,Raphael_Amiard,,,">I agree with you that the Internet has made information and knowledge far more accessible than ever before - for those who know where and how to look for it. For many/most other people, it can be even worse than previous propaganda channels of print, radio, or TV. The sheer variety of the Internet guarantees that if you don't want other perspectives and prefer company that thinks like you, you can readily limit yourself.<p>I definately agree with you, but we're talking about a totally different topic here, the one of self-limitation, or something like that. I know many people around me that are like that. Also , the best way to hide information on the internet, is not to try and prevent it to spread, but much more to drown it into tons of irrelevant content, wich can be a very effective technique, and as tech-oriented fellows, we see that done all the time. This certainly nuances my former post.",1258453769
946216,comment,946110,946196,0,0,mseebach,,,"> I don't think it would be so bad to say something like, ""Your order is in our system. We'll confirm that the restaurant got it correctly and email you in a couple minutes.""<p>It adds complexity but provides no value.<p>If you call a cab, you also accept ""be there in 10 minutes"", even though it's not confirmed, not ""Right, tell you what, I'm gonna push this button on my radio, which closes an electrical curcuit connected to a big radio, and announce your request to our fleet of cars. Now, provided that there's no interference, and that the nearest car isn't in a garage or a tunnel or something, and if the driver isn't fighting with his wife on his cellphone, or in a place getting a coffee, he'll hear the message, and radio back confirmation. He'll then drive to your address, where, bar mechanical failure of perhaps the brakes or the pressurized oil system, he will arrive in 10 minutes. Have a good day.""<p>> I think the most amusing part of this whole thing is that there's no way any user actually believes there are ~100 discrete steps to the order placement process, despite the high ""progress resolution"" of the progress bar.<p>Progress is often temporal, and time has infinite resolution. There may no be 4*60 distinct steps to the process of steeping a cup of tea, but we still accept the turn of the second-hand as a measure of progress.",1258453573

946210,comment,944290,945719,0,0,teeja,,,"""pray for it to last""<p>It could be interesting to discuss what circumstances might bring the 'source for truth' to an end ... what might be done to minimize the loss should it end ... how to route around the damage should the official internet be ended by someone afraid of the truth. It certainly is vulnerable to that ... but that doesn't mean it has to be.<p>Given the history of the world, the net may disappear and reappear several times. Before long, a large chunk of it will fit into a backpack ...<p>WRT 'not knowing before the Internet': you can have a trusted relationship with an author based on years of experience with his/her work. If everything they wrote checked out in the past - and/or they have a reputation for sweating the details - their books are inherently more valuable than a 'net source you're not friends with yet.",1258453110

946204,comment,946110,946196,0,0,patio11,,,"Twenty seven seconds.<p>Twenty seven seconds is how long it took one of my customers to a) click from my site to Paypal (T = 0), b) authenticate with Paypal, c) authorize the transaction, d) return to my site, and e) email me asking me why they hadn't gotten their Registration Key yet despite the fact that promised it would be delivered ""instantly"".  (T = 27)<p>They eventually got their Registration Key in 33 seconds (well, that was how long it took for them to click the link in it), and a few minutes later got it resent by me, along with an apology for taking so long.  (The cause was the customer winning the race back to my website with Paypal's IPN trailing behind.  It happens -- their bank took a few seconds longer to authorize it than usual, it fell into a verification queue, gremlins ate an HTTP packet, whatever.)<p>Now, I have a certain amount of luxury in dealing with customers with high expectations as to my availability, because I clear $30 on every order and if 10% of them want to chat, well, I can deal with getting paid $300 per email I write.  However, if I were running a business which processed thousands of transactions a day, and I made about a buck an order prior to paying my CS staff, I would put a significant amount of effort into making sure that you didn't become an emergency for my CS team just because you had to wait twenty-seven seconds.",1258452566

4028723,comment,4028384,4028671,3,0,jerf,,,"There's also some variants that do work, or at least could work in theory, which turn out to simply be highly inefficient photon drives. For instance, one recurring one that seems to get reinvented every few years is one where you put two electromagnets some distance from each other, and use the speed of light delay and some moderately clever polarity flipping to make it so the magnets always attract or repel each other in one direction, providing thrust. There's no reason why this won't work... except that also shoots huge amounts of defocused radio waves out the back, which is where the equal & opposite momentum is ""coming from"", and it's wildly less efficient in every conceivable way than simply shooting a conventional laser in the opposite of the direction you want to thrust. (And there's some other caveats too when you really get down to the engineering task of trying to flip the polarity of really powerful magnets at the necessary rate of speed. But it is conceivable that using real physics, you might be able to build something with this principle that could generate vanishing fractions of a Newton without necessarily blowing up....)<p>Based on the link you provide, and guessing what the QM equivalent of the differential sail (this thing, I think: [1]) would be, it seems to me this could fall into either class, something that simply won't work or something that will turn out to be another variant of inefficient electromagnetic radiation drive, once the full set of interactions is taken into account.

Insurance companies, as you said, have paid $41 billion, so there you're at $141 billion and you've barely scratched the surface as compared to the things factored in to that $235 and $257 billion figures.<p>But let's cast all that aside. Let's assume the cost is 2-3x Katrina. The incident rate is obviously not that high (there's a reason basically all nuclear plant failures trace back to a design from the 60's), but I'm sure you can plug that in.<p>There is a pretty handy Wikipedia page with details for Nuclear Plant disasters: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_and_radiation_accidents#Nuclear_power_plant_accidents"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_and_radiation_accidents...</a><p>Now, I haven't done the math for how many aggregate plant-years of operation we've had, but let's say your average plant has been in operation for 10 years (which is definitely low-balling it in the US, but the mere fact we run these old nuclear power plants is exactly why they are so much more likely to have problems). That's 4360 plant-years. The Wikipedia page has 20+ incidents listed, but that includes a lot of cases that are tiny compared to the disasters you are thinking in terms of (and of course, ironically, anyone who is insuring these things will tell you that those smaller incidents are the primary drivers of the costs in an insurance policy). I count 5 cases throughout history with costs >$1 billion. That works out to a very exaggerated rate of one incident every 972 plant-years.<p>So, with all those ""tie your hand behind your back"" factors, a premium of $50 million/year would cover costs very well and leave the insurer rolling profit margins that'll probably create a congressional investigation. That's a lot of money, but compared to the economic output of a power plant, isn't prohibitive.<p>Realistically though, newer reactor designs, particularly post-3 mile island, have a much lower incident rate than their predecessors and much better mechanisms for containing damage. If insurers were driving the design of plants, it'd probably be even lower (or costs would drop). Most insurers <i>would</i> probably also adjust their premiums based on the age of plants, which at some point would make it more cost effective to build a new one than to keep operating an old one. They'd also reduce costs by establishing rules that would limit their liability in circumstances where the failure was due to some other party not managing their responsibilities.<p>I'm curious what the real numbers are, but you can see that even being grossly unfair, insurance costs for disasters are not going to make nuclear plants economically non-viable.",1338075349

4028694,comment,4026976,4026976,1,0,tzs,,,"My first thought on this is what the hell is Dish thinking?<p>According to the news story on this I heard on NPR, those networks get the vast majority of their revenue from ads. Advertisers aren't stupid--if a significant number of people start using automatic ad skipping the advertisers will stop advertising or the price of advertising will have to come way down.<p>Note that this is significantly different from non-automatic ad skipping. I use the ""skip 30"" button all the time when I'm watching programs on my Comcast DVR, but with that I see a few seconds of the start of the first ad and end of the last ad in an ad block, and I see glimpses of some of the intervening ads.<p>That gives advertisers a chance to catch my eye--and there are several ads that have done so and I have actually went and watched them.<p>So, given that these networks will be very very very opposed to this, I would expect that they would not renew their contracts with Dish. DirectTV could then tout that they carry these networks, and Dish would be forced to drop the automatic skipping or lose customers.<p>Then I noticed that the networks suing are regular broadcast networks as opposed to cable networks. That leads to my second thought--does Dish even have a contract with these networks?<p>My recollection of how it worked when I had DirectTV was that they did have channels for the feeds from the major broadcast networks--but those were only available to subscribers who lived in an area where that network was not available via a local broadcast affiliate of the network. I believe that DirectTV was legally not allowed to offer the direct feeds to anyone who could get that network locally. You had to get it via your local channels (which DirectTV could carry).<p>If that's still the case for satellite providers, then I wonder if these networks actually have any negotiating leverage over Dish? They can threaten to pull their direct feeds--but most Dish customers won't get those anyway and Dish may be willing to piss those customers off in order to offer the ad skipping to the rest of their customers.<p>Presumably, the local affiliates of those networks in each area that Dish is carrying might also object to the commercial skipping, but perhaps for them the fees they get from Dish to allow Dish to carry them might be enough to make up for the lost local ad revenue.",1338074700

The Germans had the same head start on Russia that they had on the US, but when the Russians came into the fighting in 1941 they were already fielding the T-34 tank (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-34"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-34</a>), which outclassed any German panzer in a one-to-one engagement and may have been the finest tank in the world. The best US industry could turn out in 1941 was the abysmal M3 Lee (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3_Lee"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3_Lee</a>), which would go on to get absolutely chewed to pieces by the Germans in the North African campaign. Even the next American attempt, the iconic M4 Sherman, which was the US' standard medium tank by 1944, was unimpressive compared to contemporary Russian and German designs.<p>The big lesson of WW2, though, was that in modern all-out warfare the quality of individual tanks didn't really matter. What mattered was the quantity those tanks could be turned out in. The Germans, stung by the unexpected quality of Russian tanks, had turned their efforts toward building absolute monsters like the Tiger (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_I"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_I</a>) and Panther (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panther_tank"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panther_tank</a>). Those tanks individually outclassed any Allied tank of the era, even the Russians'. But they were so complicated to build that the Germans could only turn out a few thousand of them, which was peanuts compared to the swarms of T-34s and Shermans the Allies were cranking out. The tactical doctrine in 1944 was that it would take five Shermans, acting together, to knock out a single Tiger; but US industry turned out 12,000+ Shermans that year, while German industry would only turn out around 1,000 Tigers, so five-to-one numerical superiority wasn't hard to put together. No matter how fearsome the German tanks became, they eventually got stung to death by swarms of less impressive enemies.",1338074593

But that variability in the correctness of pricing of a stock is part of the game, is it not? As is the mis-estimation of a company's ""true worth"" by investors. If the problems with NASDAQ weren't present, and there was a first day bump as expected, I could see that instilling confidence in investors, driving demand for the stocks. Hence nanex's strongly worded quote about ripple effects. Do you disagree with that?<p>Ultimately we'll never know what would have happened, but the negative ripple effects seem plausible.",1338073452

However, the fact that electromagnetic wave cause harm or may have secondary effect in some people is not that far fetched and should not be discarded as ""is anyone really still concerned"". We just don't have a sample size of individuals troubled by it that is sufficiently large enough to prove it. The majority of us may show no signs of harm; yet I know of at least two people that suffer from electromagnetic hypersensitivity, probably resulting from having 30 different wifi signals crossing their walls day & night for the last ten years. Indeed, I don't believe cell-phone tower signals at long range are really the cause. It's more likely to be the high concentration of wifi signals inside of apartment complexes. And even if the exposure intensity is a matter of square root with respect to distance from source, you can get significant exposure when you increase the number of source or the relative average distance you are from them. So no, electromagnetic waves is nothing to sneeze at. If you think so, why don't you go sleep every night in a tiny room with 15 wifi routers on and a couple of cell-towers directly above your head?",1338073268

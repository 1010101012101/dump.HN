So I would say in the least I coded in both the languages to certain extent and I liked it. Then after my graduation like all the my friends, I joined a Software Company.

We customize these Tools or applications as per the needs of the Customers.
I was able to learn the tools easily because an expert in one of the tools, and worked on it for 3 years. In the mean time, I lost all my programming skills. I now don&#x27;t have any programming skills what so ever.I can still write snippets of code, I can visualize and write algorithms in Javascript, but I really don&#x27;t know any language. I tried to learn Python for a bit, and wasn&#x27;t successful, I gave Go a shot and failed again.

Or are they counting all magstripe transactions done by a debit card as debit?  I was specifically referring to transactions that require a PIN, which basically removes your ability to do chargebacks.<p>I honestly can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve <i>ever</i> seen someone type in a PIN code on a PoS terminal in recent memory.  I also tend to pay attention to this stuff.  That&#x27;s of course not worth anything as a data point, but I&#x27;d have expected if they are used 50% more than credit transactions I would have at least noticed it once or twice.<p>Just to be clear here:  A debit transaction is identical to an ATM transaction (from the UI point of view).  Just swiping your combined ATM+debit card at a terminal and treating it like a normal Visa/MC transaction is not what I meant.  I also (used to) prefer the debit card in that scenario for the reason you mentioned.  Then I got financially responsible and realized I was simply taking on more risk than I needed to - automated payments on my Amex work just as well.<p>Edit:  I just re-read the data, and it looks very much like they are treating bank cards with a Visa or MC logo as debit card transactions.  If so, the data is extremely misleading as no PIN codes are involved, and your fraud protection is nearly identical to an actual credit card in that case.  This would also jive with my personal experience as well.",1414043068

8496819,comment,8495419,8496583,0,0,GrouchoDarts,,,"Well, allow me to go into a bit of science detail. The two polar opposites in amplification technology today are Class A and Class D amplifiers. Class A is the classic one, and any audiophile and sound engineer will swear by them on the quality metric. Class D is modern, based on transistors (usually MOSFETs), and while it dumps the linearity, it has a huge advantage in energy efficiency. Only in recent years has Class D become competitive in quality with the lower end of Class A technology, as the linearity of amplification makes a huge difference in high quality systems at higher amplification where the details pop out more.<p>Class A uses tubes, and works in the simplest and most accurate way by amplifying the complete signal. It maintains the most important characteristic needed to perfection - linearity of waveform amplification. When you try and get extra juice out of it, instead of the annoying clipping you get from digital amplification, you get a nicer sounding and more gradual reaction. The main drawback is energy efficiency. There&#x27;s a theoretical peak efficiency of 50% to Class A amps, and what&#x27;s worse is that it&#x27;s usually less than half that. It makes tube amps that aren&#x27;t small require massive heat sinks, and increases the BOM.<p>Class D is totally different. It dumps linearity out the window in favor of energy efficiency. It basically outputs a bunch of pulses, and then applies a low-pass filter to remove the annoying artifacts. While you might say that it&#x27;s close enough - it isn&#x27;t for high fidelity systems, especially in production studios, live performance, and audiophile cases. While competitive in quality with the low end of amplifiers (under $200), if you are looking for accurate detail reproduction there is no replacing linear amplification yet. The advantage is that even at the worst use scenarios, Class D amps have over 50% energy efficiency, and usually manage over 90% for higher volumes, making them need far less in the way of heat sinks which allows for leaner designs, and a better price/performance ratio.<p>The Class D amps will eventually win out. Class A amps have decades of R&D as an advantage, but Class D is improving by leaps and bounds. Eventually, Class D will become &quot;good enough&quot; and replace Class A altogether because of the advantages in price and energy efficiency. But that day has not yet come.<p>That being said, I use a class D amp for my home set up. It&#x27;s close enough, and my power bill thanks me monthly.",1414042254

8496817,comment,8493179,8494565,0,0,shalmanese,,,"> Being employee #1 of a startup can be one of the worst positions a young developer can ask for. Long hours, high stress, low job security, and for what? 0.5% of a company that, if it survives, will most likely dilute its shares?<p>One thing that&#x27;s never really brought up in these discussions because it&#x27;s extremely poorly understood is that startup employees are the only ones given options (in the financial sense) and options are always more valuable than the underlying asset with the degree of premium based on the volatility of the asset.<p>Think of it this way, as a startup employee, your optimal strategy is to join a company, work for a year and then immediately quit if the company isn&#x27;t 5x as valuable as when you joined. Over the course of an engineering career, this gives you approximately 20 shots on goal to hit on a hyper growth company. Once you&#x27;ve hit one, you essentially have to do enough work for the next 3 years that you won&#x27;t get fired and you&#x27;re vesting stock that&#x27;s 10x - 1000x more valuable than what you negotiated. Nobody else is allowed to have the option of buying startup stock at 4 year old prices except employees and that&#x27;s the extreme advantage.<p>Unfortunately, engineers are not experts at options pricing (nor should they be) so they tend to devalue the equity portion when considering total compensation which leads to the overall dysfunction in the system.",1414042205

I&#x27;m saying perhaps these considerations are why SDP has such strange choices in formatting.<p>In context of WebRTP, SDP provides no benefits. Might as well used a JSON representation of the media negotiation, requiring no additional parser. Things are already ambiguous and poorly handled when using SDP in the real world. I think it must be something about &quot;simple&quot; permissive protocols that encourage implementation issues.",1414040559

Unless muni bonds excite you, that exam is questionable in value except in the areas where they stress suitability of investments for clients.

Wave me down someday when I have more free time and I'll gladly talk about this, or you can just look out your door in the US at someone working and ask ""Do they have that sort of job in Japan?"" and I'll tell you, right now, the answer is yes.  We have people selling food out of carts, bored DMV clerks who punch out at 5:00, part-time English teachers, retirees who run cafes, quirky musicians who made stuff for the App Store (my town has multiple App Store millionaires), and folks working at the 7-11.<p>That said, I think you may have gotten the wrong impression about what I do for a day job.  For about three of the last five years, and continuing through the end of this month, I've had a job that virtually defines Japanese salarymanhood, making Big Freaking Enterprise Web Apps for a multi-national with thousands of employees that is listed on the stock exchange.",1268020772

1174601,comment,1173582,1174194,0,0,philwelch,,,"""The point is that the government should not actually need propaganda if it is acting in the peoples' best interests. Through history most cases of government propaganda have been when the government is subverting its people's interests and lying to them about it.""<p>That's a very modern view. There was absolutely no shortage of propaganda in the US supporting World War II, especially to encourage the myriad things Americans could do to support the war effort (buy war bonds, enlist, pay taxes on time, in the case of women work outside the home so more men could enlist, avoid overconsumption and wasteful behavior). And no one reasonably considered helping America's military effectiveness in WWII to be against the people's interests.<p>Official Government Propaganda is missing from democratic societies not because democratic societies are that much more respectful of the people's interests, but because democratic societies aren't as often unified behind the same agenda. When there is something all parties substantively agree upon in a democratic society, like winning a war or curbing drug use, the government relentlessly propagandizes it. When it's something that parties disagree on, each party has its own propaganda.<p>I actually suspect there's more political propaganda in a democracy, just because the propagandists have to argue with each other.",1268020148

1174588,comment,1173679,1174511,0,0,jmoiron,,,"I've found actionbutton to be a step below the old reviews, perhaps for similar reasons that Tim now finds his honeymoon in Japan souring.  The reviews there tend to be a lot more about being entertaining than enlightening, and their stated goal of having the average score being 1/4 stars has been thrown to the wayside.  I also don't really play games anymore.<p>There are a few potentially ""important"" things that I hope escapes IC and its graduates and becomes more mainstream.  Reviews that explain the context of their creation, and reviews that examine the philosophy of the game design.  Unfortunately these are hard, require work, and don't look any better on the glossy page.  Some examples:<p>Rogers wrote a fantastic review[1] of Romancing Saga: Minstrel Song that starts off by chronicling the entire career of its designer (Kawazu) and reviewing some of his earlier games with depth and insight.  There are clear patterns evident in his early games, which are then used to give context to and explain the current game under review.<p>The second is probably my favorite video game review, which is of Windwaker by Eric-Jon Rossel Waugh[2].  EJRW is a better and more insightful (but less colorful) writer than Rogers, but perhaps not as colorful.  He made an old forum post I distinctly remember lamenting the laziness of linear game design, which is something of a cliche.  When challenged for an alternative, he backed it up with a very interesting review of the use of ""danger"" rather than contrivances like keys or inventory items as a limit on exploration in Dragon Quest/The Legend of Zelda.<p>As for this particular posting of Tim's, I don't really have much more to comment.  Like I said in my original comment, it's classic Tim Rogers, and it's hard to explain what ""classic Tim Rogers"" is without just pointing people to another 15-20 articles similar in construction and content.  It feels odd to write about it in a familiar tone since I was largely a lurker at IC (as I am here).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.largeprimenumbers.com/article.php?sid=saga"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.largeprimenumbers.com/article.php?sid=saga</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.insertcredit.com/reviews/windwaker/windwaker1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.insertcredit.com/reviews/windwaker/windwaker1.htm...</a>",1268019642

1174567,comment,1173226,1173432,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Unfortunately, a significant number of font designers and typesetters have tried to be a bit too clever with ""proper"" typography in recent years, as OpenType fonts and tools like LaTeX or InDesign have made it realistic to add professional quality typographic touches in everyday DTP projects.<p>One common example is feeling that you ""must"" include certain ligatures in a font. There is absolutely no reason to mandate this if the glyph shapes do not require it, e.g., if setting the normal shape ""f"" then ""i"" with their natural spacing does not cause an awkward overlap. Equally, if glyph combinations other than the classic f-ligatures cause awkward clashes then corresponding ligatures should be provided. So, if you saw a font where the ""fi"" ligature ran together in a confusing way, it was almost certainly a poorly designed font (or a feature of a well designed font, used poorly).<p>Another common idiocy in OpenType fonts is creating dedicated petite caps (the same height as lowercase letters) and then calling them small caps. The point of small caps is just to reduce the ""heavy"" appearance of a string of capitals, to avoid disrupting the flow for the reader. Small caps are <i>not</i> supposed to be so small that they are the same height as lowercase letters, because then small caps like O, S and C become near-enough indistinguishable from their lowercase counterparts, and if you have to do things like pluralise an acronym, things get messy.<p>See also: ""hanging"" punctuation that puts the entire mark in the margin (the point is to give a visually, rather than mathematically, even margin, and hanging a few mm of glyph out there hardly does so), hanging bullets/list markers right out in the margin (these are <i>supposed</i> to cause a visual break in the flow, that's why they're there!), using oldstyle figures where they aren't necessary (OSF can be useful for avoiding chunkiness in the same way as small caps, but suffer similar problems to petite caps where an old-style 0 or 1 can easily be misread if the context doesn't make it clear which is intended), and so on.<p>Unfortunately, there's a whole new breed of typographical snob who once read a book of rules about how typography ""should"" be done, and now apply those rules unthinkingly, resulting in documents that are neither more beautiful nor more functional that they would have been without the ""clever"" typography.",1268018399

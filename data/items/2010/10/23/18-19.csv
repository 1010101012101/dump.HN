That's the whole point of this conversation. If you want to reason from the headline of the article then you are engaging in a bit of circular reasoning: the title of the article says these people are criminal, therefore the article must be correct, because criminals are bad.<p>I think you and I can agree that criminals are bad. The question is, what do we want to define as criminal behavior?",1287860327
1824122,comment,1822847,1824059,0,0,Mz,,,"1) Get closure first, then divorce.  Most people don't seem to do this.  They do it the other way around and then do all kinds of stupid, emotionally driven, toxic things during the divorce which just amounts to shooting themselves in the foot.<p>2) Stay focused on your goal.  It no longer matters if the other person ""understands"" you and all that touchy-feely nonsense.  That stuff matters if you are staying together, not if you are going your separate ways.  So this means do not take any digs whatsoever at them.  Bite your tongue.  It isn't worth it (and not doing it is worth quite a lot of money as well as other improvements in quality of life -- an ugly divorce can really make life hard for quite a lot of reasons).<p>3) The seminal moment where we agreed to divorce set the tone for the entire divorce.  We were having the same stupid fight for about the 200th time (actual estimation, not hyperbole) and I stopped screaming at him and quietly said ""I don't want to do this anymore.  I'm tired of hurting you. I'm tired of being hurt.  I think we have both given it our best.  If we could do this dance, we would have figured it out by now (we had been married ~17 years).  I want a divorce.""  He was relieved and agreed, something he had not done on any of the occasions where I screamed and cried and shouted ""I want a divorce!"", which he had accurately interpreted roughly to mean ""God, quit hurting me so much"".  So we agreed to divorce as the only kind thing left to do for each other -- set each other free -- rather than as a means to reject the other person.  This means we both worked cooperatively to try to minimize financial damage and the like.  If we wanted to make each other miserable, we could have stayed together.  We were both very talented at making each other miserable.<p>4) I also had a class at some point on ""Negotiation and conflict management"".  <i>Getting to Yes</i> and <i>The heart and mind of the negotiator</i> (or mind and heart -- never can keep that straight) were required texts.  The first one is short, the second one a lot meatier.<p>5) Read up on the concept of ""prisoner's dilemma"" and realize that unlike actual prisoners, you aren't forbidden from talking to each other -- unless you lawyer up and have some lawyer whispering evil things in your ear about covering your ass and telling you to keep your mouth shut.<p>6) Realize this won't likely work in a genuinely abusive situation.  My marriage was tragic, not abusive.  Sometimes, covering your ass is the best thing to do.",1287860304

Basically, my PP would have been documenting my arrival times for 30 days and if a fair number were out of a 5 minute tolerance range, the PP would be used as a next step for being fired.

It's actually impossible to determine, since you can reassign any function at runtime. Essentially you can do:<p><pre><code>    self.some_func = one_implementation\n    ...\n    self.some_func = another_implementation\n</code></pre>\nThose two implementations don't have to have the same types, can accept any number of parameters, can be wrapped in something else, etc. etc. Compiler cannot figure it out ahead of time.<p>On the other hand, it opens a lot of new possibilities that are not available in compile-time type checks. For example mocking objects in other modules:<p><pre><code>    def test_some_other_module(self):\n      tested_module.SpecificClass = Mock()\n      tested_module.SomeFactory.getBlah(1,2,3)\n      self.assertTrue(tested_module.SpecificClass.called_with([1,2,3]))\n      reload tested_module\n</code></pre>\nWhether it introduces other bugs is a different discussion... Sure, it's worse than Haskell where things tend to work the first time they compile, but on the other hand I get more annoyance from Java-style types than they're worth in practice. YMMV",1287859824

I'm sorry that Wavee or whatever site you went to took your money.<p>I honestly didn't know (and still don't) if you can make any money doing an honest penny auction site.  We are just breaking even with this one so far.<p>The fact is that every time an auction goes up we have more risk than anyone else involved.  If I put up a $500 iPad it could go for extremely cheap.  The lowest one has ever gone for is 64 cents.  That means we made less than $64 and still had to buy and ship that $500 iPad.  And we have never sold anything for more than $26 which still isn't the $2600 you think it is because some packages give you more bids per dollar.<p>The legitimate complaint is when sites cheat.  Which I would guess alot of them do.  Using Facebook is not some trick to get people to trust us.  Its a way for people to verify for themselves that they are in fact bidding against other real people.<p>How can you say that its a scam?  Do you think we are just out there creating all these fake accounts with fake profile and personal photos and relationships etc.  I can see maybe if we had 5 or 6 or even 20 users.  But we have 100's of winners.  That's a stretch even for the most paranoid and cynical of people.<p>Not everybody wins every time.  But the data we have so far says that the majority of users that buy more than just a few bids are actually the ones getting all the deals.  Its the people who come in and spend $24 expecting to win a $1500 item then leave when they don't.  Those are the people who are losing.  The users who are logical enough to see how the system works are the ones who get far more than they put in.<p>And some countries outlaw all kinds of crazy things, some countries are considering passing legislation to ban homosexuality so I guess we should all agree that its bad now too according to your theory?",1287859469

So I pulled $18 out of my pocket and asked her to deposit it on behalf of that account.

Oh, did I mention this was only three years ago? It's 2007 and you're not using version control? Anyway, one day, another consultant who sat next to me got laid off and the company's IT guys never came around to remove his computer. So, I moved the computer into the cabinet over my desk and used it as my ""phantom dev server"" or alternatively ""The Travis"" (after our laid-off compatriot). I even used it as a staging server for testing deployments. There was one time that a clueless cable-jockey came up looking for the machine, I told him someone had come for it months ago, and we never heard from him again.<p>Eventually, I developed a simple content management system on the product website because the company's policies were preventing us from making copy and FAQ changes as fast as we needed. Unfortunately, I couldn't get approval to do the project, even though I had a little bandwidth and it was something we really, really needed. I told my confidant in the company what I was doing and he ran interference for me for two days while I cranked the code out. We had to wait a month for another project to get finished to slip it in along-side an approved site deployment, but once it was in the wild, our lives became incredibly easier.<p>We almost let the cat out of the bag once when we made a change <i>too</i> quickly, though. Management wanted us to change some of the contact info on the site, and to change most of the branding of the site. Since I setup <i>everything</i> to be hosted out of the CMS, including stylesheets, no deployment was necessary. What should have taken two weeks (1 day to finish and then 9 days of bureaucratic shenanigans), took only one day. The plan was to wait the 9 days, then tell them about the change, and use the time to get caught up on support tickets and other ""secret"" programming going on (like a complete rewrite of the desktop product software, this time without VB6... in 2008). One of the execs dropped into our area for an update, and the stupid phone-support guy blabbed about ""oh yeah, that's already done."" I stabbed him in the leg with a pen, and ""clarified"" that the ""work was complete and was now in the deployment pipeline."" That wasn't the first or the last time that stupid goober's mouth almost got us in trouble.<p>I miss that job. It was hard to work in the stifling environment of an ossified corporate structure, but I had good friends I was working with, and despite our team being considered ""black sheep"" and ""dangerous mavericks"", everyone respected our productivity and we were always involved in all new policy decisions (basically, they were just upset to be told they were wrong).

You can see this in performance stats, where 100 to 0 braking always takes much less time than 0 to 100 acceleration.  We don't generally quote braking power for cars, but given the increasing attention to safety it is much higher now than it has been historically.<p>Of course, this would not work well if the other vehicle was substantially heavier (best indicated by the number and size of tires).

For example, you need to know how many foo elements there are in order to generate a TOC.

7035328,comment,7034303,7035174,1,0,daenz,,,"I saw the Omni when it was announced, but I was never convinced of it&#x27;s potential.  A few things about it bother me:<p>1) Strafing is extremely unnatural.  It involves standing still in the center, lifting one leg to the edge, and &quot;swiping&quot; it down towards the center.  It&#x27;s a very impractical move for any type of game where strafing is strategic.<p>2) Backwards motion is extremely difficult.  Try to find a video of someone doing it effectively.  It&#x27;s rarely shown because it&#x27;s not easy to do.  This removes this movement as well from any game where backwards movement is strategic.<p>3) <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/tsccO4H.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/tsccO4H.jpg</a>  Not trying to be mean, but the visual of an adult using the Omni looks very much like a baby using a walker.  I believe this limits the Omni to a product you&#x27;ll only want to use by yourself, when nobody is around, because it looks silly.<p>4) The current version looks flimsy.  Maybe they&#x27;ve beefed up the structure of the thing, but any video that I&#x27;ve watched has shown serious strain on the upright portions of the Omni itself.<p>5) The fact that you have to wear special shoes, and perform a procedure to get the Omni within reaching distance of a keyboard/mouse, and lock yourself in to the mechanism... seems like quite a bit of overhead to play a game essentially handicapped in terms of movement.<p>My prediction is that some people are going to be excited about Omni, buy it, try it a few times, and realize how limiting it is in actual gameplay, how limited they are in using their computer, the fact that they look silly to others, and the overhead involved in getting dressed and locked, and realize it isn&#x27;t worth it.  They&#x27;ll push it to the side to collect dust, or try to sell it on craigslist.",1389333306

You don&#x27;t splurge on mega-hotels, distribute the money frivolously, etc. You need to use it to create the basis for a non-oil-dependent economy.<p>In many cases, building mega-hotels <i>is</i> preparing for a post-oil future by establishing yourself as a tourism center. Witness Dubai, which basically has run out of oil but sustains its economy nonetheless.<p>Abu Dhabi, also in the Emirates, has followed the Norwegian model by building up a massive sovereign wealth fund which can replace/stabilize oil revenue indefinitely. Their fund is the second largest in the world, despite having a substantially smaller population (it works out to about $1.4 million per citizen).",1389333053

7035309,comment,7034423,7034423,7,0,gruseom,,,"A persistently missing name is often a sign that the concepts haven&#x27;t been fully worked out yet. In you guys&#x27; case that could be exciting. It could mean that what you&#x27;re doing is newer and more emergent than you&#x27;ve yet realized. If so, your job is not to name the thing, but to follow it as it emerges and let it teach you what it is. Names come almost as a corollary. Until they do, lack of official names for the core concepts (what could be more core than &quot;student&quot; and &quot;school&quot;?) is an asset, not a liability.<p>You probably already have a laboratory running natural experiments in this area: the conversations of the people in your groups. If they lack official language for what they&#x27;re doing, they have no choice but to make something up. Those can be good creative conditions. If I were you, I might try to get them to tell me what the names are, by listening closely to the words they use in conversation and to which formulations feel easiest and most alive. This often works better when people aren&#x27;t consciously trying to come up with names but do it spontaneously when talking about something else.<p>By the way, maybe you shouldn&#x27;t be down on &quot;school&quot; for what you&#x27;re doing. It&#x27;s true that people have a lot of preconceptions about school. But it&#x27;s also true that your usage is historically deep. &quot;School&quot; didn&#x27;t originally mean &quot;child processing factory&quot; or whatever it is now. Here&#x27;s what Etymonline has for it [1]:<p><i>&quot;place of instruction,&quot; Old English scol, from Latin schola &quot;intermission of work, leisure for learning; learned conversation, debate; lecture; meeting place for teachers and students, place of instruction; disciples of a teacher, body of followers, sect,&quot; from Greek skhole &quot;spare time, leisure, rest ease; idleness; that in which leisure is employed; learned discussion;&quot;</i><p>That seems pretty close to what you&#x27;re doing. Historical meanings often have resonance and sometimes make comebacks. I wouldn&#x27;t relinquish this one if I were you. Imagine if you are part of a resurgence of the original meaning of schools. How cool would that be?!<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=school"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=school</a><p>p.s.

The real limit is electricity bill.<p>Also with such large setup you need good light balance. I always use inverse color scheme (light on dark background).

When you jump between project-wide search, debugging, showing git diffs, and so on.<p>This is <i>especially</i> true if you do graphics work and code. When you need to move graphics assets around your filesystem and into your IDE it&#x27;s nice to have the room (i.e., not so many overlapping windows) so you don&#x27;t spend time digging for assets, resizing assets, running scripts over assets.<p>I consider myself very productive on just my laptop screen, but sometimes I postpone large architectural changes or heavy instruments based debugging sessions until I get home.

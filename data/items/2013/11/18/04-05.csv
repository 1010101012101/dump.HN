6752647,comment,6752484,6752484,5,0,SwellJoe,,,"I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to predict. Nothing like Bitcoin has ever happened before. If it works, and if it remains the leading cryptocurrency for a few years, the upside is damned near limitless (I see a comparison to gold...but gold is such tiny percentage of the worlds transactions, and it sucks compared to the efficiency of Bitcoin). I can imagine people who would never consider gold (me, for example), using Bitcoin for everything.<p>I&#x27;m trying to visualize situations that would make me stop dealing in BTC (my companies both accept BTC now), and it pretty much boils down to: The government makes it illegal and puts stiff penalties on its use. I&#x27;d, obviously, have to stop accepting it for my businesses. But, it would be disastrous for the US economy to lose this innovation, so I&#x27;m betting it won&#x27;t happen.<p>The other variable that is difficult to predict is other cryptocurrencies. They dilute the market, but not by a lot, so far. If a truly superior competitor to Bitcoin came along, it might dethrone BTC, and replace it...leaving BTC vastly less valuable.<p>Finally, if BTC gets broken. i.e. double spend becomes possible, mining exploits, etc. that can&#x27;t be fixed without destroying existing coins...that would also cause a massive crash. I suspect we&#x27;re past the point of that being a significant risk (so many eyes looking for holes, we&#x27;d probably see if by now).<p>So, I&#x27;m betting it&#x27;s got a very big upside still.",1384750756

I&#x27;d get the occasional conflict to resolve but it generally wasn&#x27;t too bad, and I get those with Git also.<p>I&#x27;ve never worked on a project where dozens or hundreds of remote developers were contributing, but I&#x27;d say that outside of a small number of high-profile open-source projects, most people don&#x27;t.

The main thing a bank offers you is security of your assets; they have vaults for their dollar and BitCoin reserves.<p>The other thing about financial institutions is that if there is an investment opportunity that gives them the possibility of making a ton of money they will take it. As soon as they see that they can make money off of BitCoin they will welcome the exchanges with open arms.<p>I would have agreed that it wouldn&#x27;t survive the mainstream if there was a danger of a serious attempt by the United States, the EU or China to ban its use. But it appears that government agencies are smiling on BitCoin,  and both the United States government and the Chinese government appear to be embracing it. I suspect because if it becomes the world reserve currency it neutralizes the advantage that both parties have in manipulating financial markets (China by not allowing its currency to float and the US by, well, bailing out its financial system every time it leverages itself to the hilt and crashes which sends ripples through the world banking system.) The US and China want to neutralize the others&#x27; ability to manipulate their economies through monetary policy, and BitCoin gives them that opportunity.",1384750578

6752627,comment,6751710,6752406,4,0,Lazare,,,"I got the feeling they bought lots of DVDs for a variety of sources; estate sales, going-out-of-business sales, disposals from other merchants or whatever.  There&#x27;s no reason to think some new/shrinkwrapped items wouldn&#x27;t be in there.<p>For example:  My mother has an enormous collection of DVDs, some of which she rented from the local DVD rental shop, loved, and then purchased a (new) copy from Amazon &quot;just so she owns a copy&quot; but has never rewatched it or even unwrapped it.  As I don&#x27;t watch DVDs, in the (hopefully long away) event of her passing, I&#x27;d be highly inclined to see if I could find someone to just take the entire collection off my hands for a reasonable sum.  In theory, some of those DVDs, including &quot;new&quot; shrinkwrapped DVDs could end up as FBA merchandise.<p>In fact, it&#x27;s entirely possible that she has a shrinkwrapped, counterfeit DVD right now without even knowing it (due to commingling, who knows where the DVDs she orders, overwhelmingly from Amazon, actually came from?); a timebomb waiting to take out some FBA merchant if it ever finds its way back into Amazon&#x27;s supply chain (which isn&#x27;t unlikely).<p>The more I think about it, the more FBA and commingling seem like utter disasters.  It&#x27;s mixing untrusted merchandise into a &quot;trusted&quot; pool; I can&#x27;t know if the DVD I buy from Amazon came from Amazon or not.",1384750462

I think that&#x27;s the abstract bit, is that these things need to be negotiated in real-time for it to make any sense. If you find you&#x27;re doing too much work or it&#x27;s something that requires a lot of specialized knowledge, you need to get that level of pay while having it make sense to the client. I know some people try to whine that this amorphous rate idea is sketchy but then I hear stories about freelancers & small web ventures trying to do psychotic shit like quoting 2k/month for &quot;site maintenace&quot; or getting a 5k contract for &quot;SEO&quot;. I deliver MUCH better quality of service to my clients than these &quot;professionals&quot; who are trying to set up bunk service contracts as sources of recurring income. The reality is you need to have your client&#x27;s trust. I do the best work I can & if I feel I deserve extra for a job and can justify it, by all means I say so and negotiate it. And I do something similar to your lawyer in that I don&#x27;t bill for email/communications unless we have time blocked for a longer meeting, so it&#x27;s hard for the client to ever feel as if they&#x27;ve overpaid. 15 minutes on the phone every day or so on the job I let slide. Then I log most of my hours by task. What I want is to deliver them value so they can succeed and give me more work. Most clients can appreciate that.<p>Man I like your attitude larrys. Business really is an art, & I think my role model is kindof like &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; but without the illegal activities.

It is a shame they had such A-list VC&#x27;s (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and Greylock Partners), who don&#x27;t have an interest in just a good solid business.  They only wanted a huge, home run.<p>I&#x27;ve been looking around for a good replacement, and there is a gap. PiCloud really had three components.  The first was an ability to run code with arbitrary dependencies with no more than a second start up time. PiCloud called them environments. This is really the same problem Docker is addressing. Both were using LXC and AUFS to solve the problem. Unfortunately, Docker-as-a-service is very early days.  People like orchardup.com are getting there, but so far only have hourly pricing.  There is enginedock.com which has per minute pricing, but is it super early on. I&#x27;m in a &quot;Docker gap&quot;, where these services are really not at the same level that PiCloud was.<p>The second was the nice Python API, RESTful interface, and the command line interface for triggering off jobs, querying when the finish, and getting the results. That part will presumably be open sourced, but it is really all tied in to the hosting portion.<p>Then the third level is to have a bunch of machine you can load balance across, to allow per second pricing on AWS. They had such lovely high memory, high CPU machines to run on.  The split up some of the biggest EC2 cluster instances, and you could run each process on your 1/8 share.  The nearest current replacement is iron.io&#x27;s IronWorker.  However, they only have 320MB per job, which doesn&#x27;t work for my application.  Also Heroku workers are billed per second, but they only have up to 1GB of memory.  I&#x27;m hoping that this (new?) entity Multyvac can serve that role successfully.  Hopefully, they&#x27;ll tell us more detail on this soon.<p>Anyway, best of luck to the PiCloud team. You were great. Especially Aaron who did much of the tech support. Thanks.",1384749752

What do we do?<p>- Revert the merge commit<p>The important thing to note here is that this basically undoes the effect of the merge, but NOT the history. If you were to try to merge branch foo back in at a later date, git would do nothing and tell you that everything is already merged in.

I like git, by no means is it the best solution for all cases.<p><i>if git is great, is it worth changing an enterprise to use it?</i><p>There are a ton of factors involved in answering that question. A lengthy blog post could be made trying to answer that.<p><i>when the auditors come, I need to list the changes on a server. when its an app, the changes to that app. who, what, when, where, why - reviewer, requestor, approver, author, deployer, etc.etc.etc.</i><p>This depends on how git is setup. In the simple model of everyone on a team having push access to one origin server that serves as, effectively, the central repo, and that repo allows force pushes, then yes, this may not satisfy an auditor. As in, anyone on the team can rewrite history. Of course, when the central repo suddenly doesn&#x27;t match up with all the copies everyone else has, somebody will probably realize that something is amiss.<p>That said, being a DVCS, it is not hard to setup something where only a few top level people have push access to the what we&#x27;ll call the authority server, and all commits from everyone else has to flow through these trusted people. Additionally, force pushing can be disabled on the authority server, so no one person can rewrite history (aside from the people who have direct file system access to the authority server).<p>Or, think github - people fork a repo, then submit a pull request. Tons of people <i>can</i> commit to a repo, but most commits flow through a trusted few.<p><i>how granular and how far back can i get this with GIT?</i><p>If you are asking history, the git history goes back to the very first commit. It is also easy to list the entire history of just one file, and more.<p><i>how solid is the nonrepudiation factor with GIT?</i><p>As with a couple answers previous, it all depends on how git is deployed in the organization. The answer will vary from none to rather good, depending on the deployment.<p><i>for commits - can i see who else might be looking at code? for security</i><p>If you&#x27;ve granted access to someone to be able to pull from your repository, then no, you can&#x27;t see who is looking at what. Anyone with pull access will have access to the entire repo. Want finer grained control here without resorting to multiple repositories? Then git is not the right vcs. This is where something like Perforce will win.<p><i>can i protect others from getting the code?</i><p>In what way? People who already have some access to the repo? See the above answer. Or Joe Q Public? That is trivial.<p>--<p>Basically, the big area where something like Perforce (or even SVN I believe) will win is when you need fine grained control over security. E.g. User A only has access to this subfolder, User B only has access to this other subfolder, etc.",1384748418

6752475,comment,6751191,6752286,1,0,alskdjfhg,,,"It should be noted that I&#x27;ve upvoted every single person who&#x27;s disagreed with me here, as far as I know. That said.\nIn 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn&#x27;t do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they&#x27;d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.\nMy mother&#x27;s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He&#x27;s not particularly successful as an engineer, but I&#x27;ve met lots of other engineers who aren&#x27;t as good as me at physics, so I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s not just a result of him being bad at it. I&#x27;m also pretty good at engineering. I don&#x27;t have a degree, and other than physics I don&#x27;t have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).\nI have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I&#x27;ve come across. Every question of existentialism which I&#x27;ve seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or HN or anywhere else, the thoughts haven&#x27;t been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I&#x27;ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.\nPsychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there&#x27;s no aspect of psychology which I don&#x27;t have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud&#x27;s theories.\nI&#x27;m a good enough writer that I&#x27;m writing a book and so far everybody who&#x27;s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that&#x27;s not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I&#x27;ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.\nI don&#x27;t know if that will suffice as evidence that I&#x27;m intelligent. I&#x27;m done with it, though, because I&#x27;d rather defend my maturity, since it&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.\nI believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn&#x27;t just faking it, I&#x27;d even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self&#x27;s actions, it shouldn&#x27;t be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.\nI don&#x27;t believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren&#x27;t harming others. I don&#x27;t have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don&#x27;t care what a person&#x27;s fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don&#x27;t have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that&#x27;s not really an impressive moral, but it&#x27;s unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.\nI&#x27;m pretty much a pacifist. I&#x27;ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I&#x27;ll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don&#x27;t attack, I&#x27;ll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don&#x27;t fight back. I&#x27;ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I&#x27;m never in a situation where I&#x27;ll be worse off after a fight. If I&#x27;m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don&#x27;t care.\nThe only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I&#x27;ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I&#x27;d prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don&#x27;t believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it&#x27;ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old HN &quot;women are crazy&quot; circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don&#x27;t think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren&#x27;t awesome.\nThat doesn&#x27;t mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything&#x27;s OK when it&#x27;s really not (and that&#x27;s a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I&#x27;m kind of tired of citing these examples and I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re getting tired of reading them, if you&#x27;ve even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the HN brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I&#x27;m pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments). And, uh, I&#x27;m a pretty poster.\nAll that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?",1384747894

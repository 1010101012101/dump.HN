In the state of NJ, the only categories on standardized tests given to all K-12 students are Advanced Proficient, Proficient, and Partially Proficient.  Advanced Proficient is really what you would just call normal.  There is no recognition for high performers. Schools spend almost all of their time on getting kids above the Proficient mark because this is ultimately how funding will be allocated.  Also, if you have too many kids below Proficient, the state can take over administration of your district.",1290916546

1946605,comment,1945352,1946420,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Ah, but I'm not. I'm distinguishing between a purchase and a limited license.<p>I used the analogy of the car because we're familiar with it - we all understand you can buy a car, and also that you can rent one on a temporary basis. The kind of transactions you can perform on an object are not a function of the object itself.<p>So with software (or a movie or book etc. etc.) I could sell you all the rights: not just to use/watch/read it as a consumer, but to exploit it for commercial gain as a publisher. This is like the purchase of a car; you can do whatever you want with the property you now own. Or I could just grant you a limited license, reserving other rights for myself, as with the rental situation. This is what happens now when you 'buy' a piece of software or media - you're really buying the rights to a single copy of it. You can still do whatever you want with that single copy, but as soon as you start making your own copies - even if you're giving them away for free, or simply making them available via bittorrent - then you've gone into the publishing business. Now I don't necessarily approve of this approach, but that's how things are. You're getting into a contract with a publisher when you buy their wares, just as surely as if you had rented a car. That it's trivially easy to circumvent the terms of that contract doesn't alter the fact that you're a party to it.<p>Look at it this way: suppose you owned a printing company, and you happen to have all the technology you need to make books of any kind. And let's say you can also easily get them into bookstores. You get a hardback copy of <i>Harry Potter's Secret Diary</i>, a supplement to the popular series of books that is sure to sell millions. Since you have a book-style printing press on hand, you spend a busy week making plates and then rush out a paperback edition, on which you make a handsome profit. You've used your own paper, ink etc., so the original publisher is no worse off and hasn't lost a single copy of their stock.<p>Is this cool?",1290916198

This is irrelevant today because nobody is censoring DNS yet.  Combine documented DNS censorship with documented blocking-of-port-53, and the problem will be fixed in hours.<p>(Funny story; my work laptop has some software installed that only allows ssh connections to be made when connected to the VPN.  But when connected to the VPN, there are no routes to the Internet, so I can't check my email while traveling with my work laptop.  Change my sshd to bind port 443 in addition to 22, though, and ... the restriction is gone.<p>Censoring the Internet is hard, even when you control the network or client machine!)",1290916149

1946565,comment,1946362,1946362,0,0,geophile,,,"My story:<p>In 1995 I had a technical idea underlying a product, and tried to do it at my current company. It was an uphill slog due to lots of resistance, and it just wasn't happening. Java 1.0 had just come out. My company was thinking about client-side Java (which is how Java was initially positioned). My idea made more sense server-side and I liked Java. I decided that my idea was potentially useful and decided to do it on my own. I gave myself eight months to build something and then figure out what to do with it. I had no idea how to sell it, market it, did zero market research. I have a very understanding wife.<p>Eight months later, prototype is done and working great, and I had been trying to find interested parties. A tech giant in Redmond was ""interested"", but only because they were hiring people in my area of expertise. They were going to buy the software to hire me. It was basically a signing bonus. But I visited and <i>could not stand</i> the place.<p>A friend of a friend put me in touch with a VC who put me in touch with a local startup who bought my software for a decent amount of equity. The startup went on to a good exit and I lived happily ever after.<p>Obviously, I was <i>extremely</i> lucky. The idea I just had to work on happened to actually have some value. But I just as easily could have been fooling myself. Things are very different now, due to open source, and I think that the path I took wouldn't work any longer. Certainly not for the technology I worked on, (there are now many open source products available), but obviously lots of software that used to be proprietary now isn't.<p>As for what you should do: Do you have a technical idea, requiring innovative software? (I'm assuming you are a software engineer.) Or do you have a business idea that requires only well-understood technology? If it's the latter, and if you are primarily a techie, the risk of fooling yourself is much higher.<p>No matter what you do, be very careful about IP issues with your current employer. They can lay claim to anything you do while you are employed. Review your employee agreement and think about whether your idea overlaps anything your company cares about. I suggest talking to a lawyer with some experience in IP and employee agreements if you decide to pursue your idea while employed. (As I was about to sell my software to the startup, my old employer accused me of stealing trade secrets, which nearly killed the deal. They had no basis for the charge -- they were on a fishing expedition. But it made my life miserable for several weeks.)",1290915021

You can't change your DNS easily when using the Verizon Wireless 3G network's provided hardware, but if you are using your device in tethering mode or a USB-connected fashion, you certainly can use whatever DNS service you want.<p>How did this happen?  We have, in the past, been blocked by Verizon Wireless, either deliberately or due to technical issues, but it is not the case today.  I've been a VW customer for a few years, and it's a great service.  And today, Verizon FIOS service requires the user to have CPE that doesn't allow the user to change their DNS (same with ATT U-Verse).  Sprint Wireless blocks us today, and always has.<p>In my phone interview, done too hastily or speaking too quickly, I misspoke when speaking about Verizon FIOS and Sprint Wireless as examples of how our customers aren't able to use our service and mixed up the companies.  That or the reporter misheard.  Either way, this is a good reminder of why it's always better to do email-based interviews.  The reporter in this case is a very good one whom I've worked with in the past, so I'm confident the error was mine.  In fact, most of the post (it's a Q&A) doesn't really capture the entirety of our discussion, which is unfortunate.  My actual sentiments are far less anti-ISP and pro-Google than I think they came out.  (repeat, I really dislike phone interviews)<p>It's unfortunate that I wasn't able to correct the story earlier, though we did work to get the original Washington Post blog updated right after it posted (and it was corrected).  Other sites didn't quite seem to pick up the update.  I've been trying to update other blogs where I can because it's not fair for VW to be painted in this light.  It should have been Sprint Wireless.   Some folks on my staff have also worked with Verizon Wireless to make sure that they are not blocking us, and I thank them for their efforts.",1290913996

I read the book a few years back when I was taking courses in machine learning and metaheuristics, and I recall being impressed. After picking up a molecular biology background, however, I've become skeptical of any claims to model ""algorithms"" after the brain or neuron or neocortex. Regardless of the level of abstraction chosen by the investigator, it isn't enough.<p>To put it simply, I strongly feel that achieving any kind of biologically-inspired intelligent agent will require a systems biologic approach where we model every minute molecular detail in silico. This isn't an undertaking that we even have the technology for at present. We don't have the raw speed, level of parallelism, or even the molecular/cell physiologic details necessary to model even parts of the brain. (Even of Drosophila!)<p>The Blue Brain project is nice and is worth following for nothing other than learning best engineering practices for developing the architecture behind something of this scale and complexity--but every simplification we make introduces error. (Imagine patching it! Imagine the ""oops"" moment, when some molecular mechanism doesn't work as we expected--and that's a regularly occurring event.) I'm not even sure how much simplification we can make before the emergent properties of the brain no longer function. Some of my colleagues say membrane potentials and the cytoskeletal system have key quantum interactions that encode state information--something we don't even understand yet. (I can't comment much on that, since I haven't studied quantum physics.)<p>I'm actually learning to develop algorithms that will focus on the interplay of the genomic machinery (promoters/enhancers, tx, translation, chaperones/folding, etc), biochemical pathways and kinetics, concentration levels, receptors, etc. in the hopes that one day we will be able to model systems like the brain. But from my limited knowledge, a project on the brain scale will only succeed after we solve the ""much less complicated"" problems: cancer, alzheimers, and aging, all of which are all cell-level problems. That's where we have to focus at present--and you can see how much more remains to be done.",1290913361

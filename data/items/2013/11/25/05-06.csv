Much more often than you&#x27;d think, that is the crucial point of novelty and competitive advantage, and what many patents cover. Software eating the world and all that.<p><i>> ... And they are all things that, like other software, can be protected by copyright.</i> <p>Functional things cannot be covered by copyright. If it&#x27;s the functionality itself that is novel, no amount of copyright can protect it.<p><i>> On the other hand, the watch isn&#x27;t the same thing. The formula that describes the timing of a watch mechanism is not a watch mechanism. A watch simulator is not a watch. </i><p>That wasn&#x27;t my point. Simulation is not what I mean. A watch mechanism is essentially a series of cascaded counters. X &quot;ticks&quot; of one gear = Y &quot;ticks&quot; of another gear. It&#x27;s an algorithm: if (m++ == 60) h++; You&#x27;ll find such physical implementations of algorithms all over the place if you know where to look, especially in automation, from factories to toasters.<p><i>> You can patent a physical watch without patenting its &quot;algorithm&quot; ...</i><p>And that applies to most &quot;software patents&quot; too. Most software patents don&#x27;t cover the abstract algorithm, they cover the application of that algorithm. Case in point, the patent in TFA: it didn&#x27;t cover comparing a bunch of numbers to find another number, it covered comparing a bunch of numbers representing preferences to find a match between business entities associated with those preferences. You could very well use the exact same algorithm to find a match between a vacationer and a list of vacation spots and not infringe the patent. I&#x27;d say the judge&#x27;s analysis in rejecting was a bit off: this patent is invalid because it&#x27;s non-novel, not because it&#x27;s abstract.<p><i>> The second is a refutation of the first.</i><p>No, but do you mean to say that the majority of software startups are doing technically innovative work? Heck, look at the much vaunted YC companies. How many are doing something beyond some variation of CRUD?<p><i>> If you take Microsoft, IBM et al as not doing anything particularly technically innovative...</i><p>I&#x27;m sorry, I live outside the HN bubble, so I completely disagree that Microsoft and IBM don&#x27;t do innovative work. (Well, OK, these days it&#x27;s mostly IBM Research, in case of IBM. In case of Microsoft, both MSR and MS products introduce inventions and innovations at a pretty fast pace.)   Just because <i>you</i> don&#x27;t see them doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t there.<p>Sadly, the vast majority of the software industry is <i>not</i> like Microsoft and IBM. The vast, vast majority involves translating pre-existing business logic into code. And most software startups are not much different.<p>I agree, though, that most patents (not just &quot;software patents&quot;), are not really &quot;interesting&quot;, but historically this has always been so. And all the hand-wringing you see here is not new either.<p><i>> It doesn&#x27;t surprise me that the study found both of these. This is evidence that software patents are ineffective to promote innovation. </i><p>Well, then maybe we need to make it cheaper to file &quot;software&quot; patents <i>and</i> make them more powerful so they afford some real protection? :-)<p><i>>The real trouble is that software patents areharmful, because they entrench incumbents by creating patent thickets and facilitate the trolling of successful innovators by lawyers and failures.</i><p>There is no undisputed, convincing empirical evidence that software patents are harmful on average, other than tech media fishing for rage-views. For every paper saying software patents harm entrants, there&#x27;s one saying the opposite (see &quot;Software Patents, Incumbents and Entry&quot; as an example). There are even studies suggesting that thickets <i>helped</i> innovation by centralizing licensing efforts.<p>Also: &quot;Innovators&quot;. You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you etc. etc.<p><i>> If we get rid of software patents then VCs would need to find some other signaling mechanism to distinguish between startups, ...</i><p>1. It&#x27;s not just in software that VCs look for patents. If you read that survey or other studies, or heck, watch Shark Tank, you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s common in most industries.<p>2. If you drop the empirically unfounded assumption that all patents are bogus, a patent is a proxy for a multitude of signals that VCs find useful.<p>3.  Studies show that startups with patents are <i>more</i> likely to have a successful exit. I don&#x27;t know what better signal a VC would want to find.",1385359167

Colored Coins use the native currency of its protocol - bitcoin. The developer of the first colored coins client, Stefan Thomas, moved on to become CTO of ripple. Ripple is a new protocol altogether, with advantages over extensions/overlays on the bitcoin protocol, the main ones being no mining and much quicker ledgers.<p>User-issued assets on ripple have a customizable transit fee which is effectively collected in the issued currency (since the fee is paid from the balance of the issue back to the issuer). For example, bitstamp&#x27;s issuer fee is 0.2%, so any trades of bitstampBTC or bitstampUSD pay 0.2% of the amount back to bitstamp&#x27;s issuer address.

Functionality like indexes and query languages are in the Zope world application level functionality build on top of the ZODB. The ZODB turned out being a database solution for many large scale projects (up to several 100 GB). There are options for sharding (mount points) and replications (ZRC, Relstorage). The ZODB is unlikely the solution that you would use nowadays for &quot;big data&quot; however keep in mind that the ZODB is already 15 years old and severed many people in professional solutions for more than a decade. We know of many businesses still using the ZODB in mission critical applications. But yes, the ZODB is an object store and not a RDBMS - it&#x27;s a completely different beast - like always: use the right tool for each project. And the ZODB was already &quot;NoSQL&quot; by the end of the 90s of the last millennium.

The F_FULLFSYNC fcntl asks the drive to flush all buffered data to permanent storage.  Applications, such as databases, that require a strict ordering of writes should use  F_FULLFSYNC to ensure that their data is written in the order they expect.  Please see fcntl(2) for more detail.&quot;<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man2/fcntl.2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin...</a><p>&quot;F_FULLFSYNC - Does the same thing as fsync(2) then asks the drive to flush all buffered data to the permanent storage device (arg is ignored).  This is currently implemented on HFS, MS-DOS (FAT), and Universal Disk Format (UDF) file systems.  The operation may take quite a while to complete.  Certain FireWire drives have also been known to ignore the request to flush their buffered data.&quot;<p>OS X has aggressive file buffering in memory, and it&#x27;s getting more aggressive all the time. For example, cfprefsd, introduced in 10.8 (<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/DataManagement/RN-CoreFoundationOlderNotes/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/DataMan...</a>) made it so that when a system application read a preferences file, it stayed in memory and ignored the disk version, until cfprefsd eventually synced it back to disk. In 10.9, the behavior is <i>much</i> worse to the point that as soon as a pref is in cfprefsd, it&#x27;s unlikely to leave it until the user logs out / the machine reboots.<p>In this instance, OS X has, for quite some time, had &quot;defrag on the fly&quot; for files under 20MB in size. On access of the file, it&#x27;s read into memory and kept there in its entirety until memory pressure from other processes triggers a sync it back to disk. When it comes to writing a small file back to disk, OS X will &quot;get around to it&quot; when it&#x27;s damned well ready unless you force its hand using the fcntl options above.<p>Unfortunately, the bit about <i>&quot;This is currently implemented on HFS, MS-DOS (FAT), and Universal Disk Format (UDF) file systems&quot;</i> covers pretty much the range of filesystem types that OS X can natively read+write on - but one that might get past this is ExFAT. I&#x27;d be surprised if that was the case, but it is natively supported read+write on OS X and would be something quick and easy to test (set up an ExFAT volume for the database) and possibly verify this is the root cause.<p>(Additionally, third-party read+write access to filesystems like NTFS via Paragon / Tuxera may be able to confirm this as well.)<p>More reading material (MySQL has been dealing with this since 2005): <a href=\"http://lists.apple.com/archives/darwin-dev/2005/Feb/msg00072.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://lists.apple.com/archives/darwin-dev/2005/Feb/msg00072...</a>",1385357262

If a sufficiently large group of miners say &quot;We will include transactions in blocks that we mine if and only if the input-output residual is 0.05BTC.&quot;, then transactions without this fee will have a low chance of making it onto the blockchain.<p>If this fee becomes too high, then people may abstain from paying it, reducing the number of transactions that miners are processing, reducing their profit, thus inducing them to lower the fee to capture a larger number of transactions and hence greater profit. There must be some kind of equilibrating fee, modelling this would make an interesting paper / blog post.",1385355603

4554498,comment,4553658,4553658,2,0,chernevik,,,"This sounds like liquidity is a bug rather than a feature, because those secondary trades don't send capital to the companies.  But that liquidity is part of why the primary capital went into the company, and that liquidity supports a flock of risk management and information signalling functions.  So I'm not sure why the focus on liquidity per se.<p>Given that the rejection of HFT has to be overbroad.  If they liquidity they provide is the sort of that supports the functions we like, who cares what their holding periods are?<p>It certainly seems true that Cuban is right about ""hacking"" the market insofar as yeah, a good deal of HFT sounds like exploitation of rules and procedures to avoid creating the fair market intended.  But that means there is ""bad"" liquidity, which doesn't serve our purposes.  Okay, so let's write rules that better serve our purposes for liquidity.  (And if we're worried about market distortions from bad trading liquidity, what about the market distortions from Fed provision of currency liquidity?  The wash of cash has lifted all asset prices, it's hard to see economic signals when price correlations are moving to one.)<p>Cuban seems to think we can do just that by manipulating investor incentives -- give them tax breaks for holding periods, tax transactions, etc.  But all of these just make the market more complex, and increase the differential between investment categories -- all of which creates more incentive for financial hacking and further detaches pursuit of financial return from realization of economic return.  It makes the rules less comprehensible.  And it gives the politicians and regulators more to do in the markets, which makes them more attractive targets for lobbyists.  He's increasing the incentives for soft corruption while making it harder to spot, the consequences are easily predicted.<p>Cuban is a smart and pragmatic guy with billions of reasons to think himself smarter than the average bear.  Part of his smarts are an ability to keep it simple, and an instinct when things are out of whack.  But here that instinct have lead him through simple on to simplistic.",1348246448

I'd say the same thing about your Google password, but if you use two-factor authentication is isn't quite so bad (and in that case Pandora isn't a concern).<p>The reality is though, what Pandora is doing prevents the password from going over the 'net at all, which arguably protects it from being stolen <i>better</i>. For someone to get access to it, they'd need access to your machine, at which point... just how secure do you think your PayPal and Google accounts (assuming no two-factor auth) will be?<p>The main increased risk factor if you shared your PayPal and Pandora passwords would be that if someone had read-only access to your filesystem, they could still get your PayPal password (which wouldn't otherwise be the case).

Only developers who create ""non-OK"" apps would join this, and if we did Twitter would be happier than ever as they stopped us without any action on their part.<p>And no, I don't support Twitter API changes, but we knew that we were taking risks when developing for a closed platform.<p>EDIT: added last paragraph.",1348246067

They looked reasonably lived in, solid places with actual inhabitants. The Falcon looked like my parents used station wagon.<p>It can go wrong, the Aliens movies always end up in a future that's positively filthy.

It's lived in, bustling, stylish (at various levels of fashion), shiny and bright where it counts, unfashionable where it should be and just dirty enough in the places that should be dirty. Small details, like the dirt Leeloo picks up when escaping the lab, add to this feeling of solidity. Popular culture is magnified to stand out amongst the crushing masses, and it seems like a place with endless nooks and crannies to explore. It's not utopian, but it's not dystopian. It feels like what the future would be like if it were the present...and somebody made a modern day adventure movie.

Sometimes unknowingly, but they do. Here are some ways I've personally experienced it (I'm going to say ""lie"" in quotes  because often they're not trying to intentionally mislead you):<p>1) They ""lie"" about their objective: Spend some time selling, even somewhere low-pressure like a hardware store. All day everyday customers will tell you they want <i>A</i> when they really need <i>B</i>. Granny tells you she needs some CLR, but when pressed, it turns out she's trying to fix a leaky faucet. She actually needs a new valve.<p>2) They ""lie"" about their actual need: This happens in consulting frequently. ""We need a team of 5 to finish this project for us"" - in actuality the project was ill-conceived, the business is falling apart, and what they <i>really</i> need is strategy/finance/etc consulting.<p>3) They ""lie"" about what they'd pay: Needs little explanation; it's why experienced businesspeople tell you that promises for orders are worthless and <i>actual</i> orders (with P.O./check attached) are golden.<p>> <i>People have no idea what they want.</i><p>Quite true, but you can get to the bottom of what they need with a skillful enough approach.<p>The thing is, you <i>have</i> to talk to potential customers or you're taking on more risk than you need to. Yes, you can build something ""useful"", but what you and I find useful might be useful to 0.0001% of the population and not have wide enough appeal to make a business out of.<p>If your product is simple or easy-to-understand enough, your conversation can be a simple sales pitch and a preorder form -- if you get the orders, customers want it.

The majority of trades out there are in fact market making related. The ones that are market taking are usually at the expense of OTHER HFT algorithms, the ones that are slow and showing out dated prices.<p>And yes, HFT algorithms most DEFINITELY hold inventory. Some don't, but most do. It's too expensive to get hit on a bid and then try to get rid of it right away. They often hold inventory for days, weeks, even months. I know this for a fact. I can't tell you know much time is spent on worrying about and managing the inventory HFT systems accumulate.<p>HFT is immensely useful for large mutual funds. They replaced a broken system of high school dropouts who worked on the floor of the NYSE. Mutual funds HATED calling the floor, waiting an hour for execution, not knowing what was happening, and inevitably being taken for a ride. This is all public...go ahead and read a lot of the articles after Thain took over as president of the NYSE and gave tours of the floor to the large mutual fund managers...they were not impressed, to put it mildly.<p>With HFT, you have transparency and immediacy. You put in an order, and you get that price. In the old days, mutual funds called in an order, and had no idea what they would get, it would be whatever fill the NYSE trader gave them. Executing orders throughout the day makes perfect sense, and is cheaper execution in the long term. You simply get a bad price if you try to sell a billion shares of MSFT in an instant, so instead you spread it over time.<p>HFT does not front run in any way that is different than trading since the beginning of time. They are trying to understand if their is future demand, and adjusting their prices accordingly. You don't think that after being hit on a bid, the old NYSE floor traders didn't change their prices?

Almost every scientific issue with a lot of money at stake will have a well funded opposition keen on clouding the debate as much as possible.  They've gotten much better at it over the years.  Instead of denying things, they instead attempt to create an impression of greater dissent than there actually is.<p>This is very effective.  Even intelligent, well-informed people have a limit to the amount of time they can devote to simply understanding an issue.  Mainstream media also leans toward presenting ""the other side"", which is admirable enough, but tends to give the impression of greater uncertainty than there often is on scientific issues.<p>And lastly, there <i>is</i> political scare mongering.  Scientists tend to be conservative about their projections and use language that often appears to be equivocation (""we found no evidence of X"", ""early studies show some support X""..."")  This opens the door for people who don't equivocate, including people who want to undermine science because they don't like the conclusions <i>and</i> people who want to reach conclusions that go far beyond the evidence.   This causes rifts  which become fertile ground for people who seek to create the impression of dissent on issues that aren not controversial among scientists.<p>I recognize that it is <i>exceptionally</i> difficult to educate yourself on complex issues in science, especially when faced with people who are determined to confuse.  If a physicist tried to explain to me how my microwave works, and another physicist was determined to convince me that the first explanation was bunk, I would ultimately not be able to tell truth from fiction.  In the end, I would have to either go back to school and study for years, or decide who seems most credible.<p>This is why I am more likely to put much greater emphasis on opinions from respected research institutions (such as the mayo clinic).  Not blind faith - they can be wrong. Just a greater inclination to listen and stronger emphasis as I shape my opinions.<p>In the end, I'd emphasize that this <i>is</i> a scientific issue, and that you are capable of ignoring pop media and going to the source to read up on the science on this issue if you are inclined to do so.  Or, you could go on smoking a pack a day for the next 20 years as you wait for all the dust to settle on the highly controversial question of whether smoking correlates with lung cancer.",1348245258

This stuff gets dug up when the decision to fire an executive is already made, in order to reduce severance. If the lie is small and reasonable (slight title inflation) it doesn't much matter because that's so common, but if it's something immensely embarrassing like faking a college degree when he actually flunked out, it gets broadcast. Most of those public humiliation stories are cases of failed severance negotiations in which the company decides to be a dick and play the nuclear option against his reputation to get out of a contractual severance agreement (e.g. extortion against the fired employee.)<p>This is not to condone lying on a resume. I don't, but I think the public shaming that accompanies these digging expeditions is a bit much.

Still a developer issue as far as I can tell, not a user issue yet.<p>Lack of support describing how developers use new hardware isn't a bug nor does it make the iOS less useful. Again, a developer issue not a user issue.<p>So the iOS is now deemed less useful by you because you have to tap ""App Store"" tap ""Charts"" and click ""Install"" on youtube, and podcast? Sounds like you are ranting for the sake of ranting.<p>A lot of people feel the need to complain for some reason but I don't quite understand why. I don't see a smoking gun. There are no broken antennas, and MobileMe didn't crash. Sounds like a company just released a brand new product and there are some small bugs to work out. Which it what I would expect, from any company. We all know Samsung has bugs, MS Windows 8 has bugs, Nokia 920 has bugs. When I got a Galaxy S, 2 years ago, I received an OTA update v2.2.2, it bricked my phone. It bricked a lot of peoples phones.  They stopped doing OTAs after that. Then the GPS didn't work. That was sort of accepted as a flaw in the GS v2.2.2. I had to root my phone and run a third party hack to get it to work. The mp3 player had a button to view music by album but tapping it would crash the player. That wasn't fixed until much later, v2.3.4, 9months after google released it. Had to use my brothers PC, install software on PC to install sw update on phone. Ridiculous. Virtually no updates to touchwiz UI. Garbage! Calls were always dropped constantly. Then I got a GS2. It would crash... all the time. I had to reboot nearly everyday. That is sort of expected with the GS2, calls were dropped all the time. Text messages wound't come through on Google Voice. The control buttons on the headphones worked erratically but mostly not at all. TouchWiz is a disaster. Battery life was maybe 8 hours of standby. I had to charge to phone two times a day. The phone IS TOO FUCKING BIG! Trying to use the phone one handed, the thumb muscle would touch the screen before the tip of the thumb causing unintentional taps. These aren't developer issues, these are 'real' user issues. What droidfans aren't saying is that Android is rough, and they like to fiddle with it, they like to mod it and install patches, and break it and reinstall it, and fuck with it some more.

I always thought you'd need another dimension to describe that, and another dimension for the square root of <i>that</i> unit, and so on.<p>But think of i as a 90 rotation, so applying it twice (squaring it) results in 180 which is -1.  Then i is a 45 rotation so applying it twice results in 90 which is i.  Sure enough, this works out.  The unit vector at 45 is 0.52 + 0.52 * i.  Follow the rules of complex arithmetic to square that and you do indeed get i.<p>A rotation of -135 applied twice gives the same result.  Square the unit vector of -0.52 + -0.52 * i and you also get i.  We've arrived back at the axiom that all numbers have two square roots of opposite signs.<p>Last question: What's the <i>cube</i> root of i? Easy: a 30 rotation.

Hopefully, pushing these people into jobs that make something real instead of skimming the top of everybody's retirement savings (I can see why those who want to be  traders would be upset about this).<p>Ah but you say, all we have done is replace humans from skimming our retirement savings by machines that do the same. This would be true if there was only one computer system competing against the human traders but there is a whole industry and they also compete against each other. Two sophisticated machines that trade against each other, will not only beat the human trader and put him out of business but reduce the arbitrage opportunity and margin each of these computer systems can exploit.<p>Contrary to what the article states, computers that compete against each other will tend to eliminate all short term unjustified price swings and leave only accessible prices based on real company fundamentals. Only long term traders that bet on fundamentals will be able to make money and they will make more money than when they were subject to be exploited through market distortions and bubbles.<p>This can all be proven by something called the efficient market hypothesis:<p>There is a great explanation by Glen Whitman of Agoraphilia, that uses grocery line wait time predictions as a metaphor:\n<a href=""http://agoraphilia.blogspot.com/2005/03/doing-lines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://agoraphilia.blogspot.com/2005/03/doing-lines.html</a><p>See also:<p><a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/yv/markets_are_antiinductive/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/yv/markets_are_antiinductive/</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis</a>",1348244538

The hypocrite does one thing and instructs you not to do that thing (or to do another instead) - but by their actions they're showing, rightly or wrongly, that the thing they're counselling against is something they've chosen [to some extent] for themselves.<p>In the case of the meth addict you assume that they're being helpful because you assume (barring personal wisdom on the matter) that meth is bad, m'kay. But perhaps they just want to keep all the lovely, lovely meth for themselves??<p>If a person espouses a universal good - avoiding meth is good for everyone. Or if that person espouses a personal good without explaining why it doesn't apply to them - avoiding meth is good for you. But still that person acts opposite to that they espouse - eg take meth. Then they're acting contrary to what they state will be to their benefit.<p>You can't trust such a person. Either they act in ways that they know are detrimental or they are lying to you about the benefits available by following their actions.<p>So you can't trust a hypocrites testimony nor can you - without outside knowledge - learn what actions are best to take solely from their testimony.<p>Coming back to the case in hand. Is it wrong to copy someone's design? We can't tell if Apple Corp consider it wrong or right. All we know is that they're untrustworthy. Then they use legal process to punish someone for allegedly copying a design whilst on the other hand copying a design and show that they're willing to act to the detriment of others who follow their lead. It's kinda hypocrisy+plus: not only do we say not to do that which we do but we'll punish you for doing that which we do.<p>><i>narrow minded logic explained in the article, that cares not what is good for them to do, but if the guy that advocates it is ""consistent""</i> //<p>Whatever a hypocrite advocates is basically irrelevant. One should discard their testimony about the good of an action and use outside sources/testimony to establish independently the nature of any good that can be derived by following their instruction.

I think there needs to be tight regulation on HFTs to limit behaviour like quote stuffing, spoofing and other forms of gaming, but I don't agree with the argument that they are a net bad thing.",1348243403

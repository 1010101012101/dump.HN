Fine, doesn't matter.  Do what makes you happy for your web app.<p>And besides, this ""measurement"" has nothing to do with the functional reliability of the app.  99.99% of requests completing within 100ms doesn't mean the other 0.01% of requests fail (as another poster noted); it just means they take longer.  If you're worried about requests failing (as we all should be!), then that's a separate issue to deal with.

It might be the case that MD5^2(a) == MD5^2(b) where MD5(a)!= MD5(b), but not the other way around. So collisions in MD5^2 will be a superset of collisions in MD5.

As they add more features to the premium, one could try creating different tiers with higher and higher starting points, you could then really start to see and breakdown where different segment's fall in the value scale.  Anyone that paid more than the next tier, automatically gets in(can donate more if they want)?  I am sure this would lead to too many plans (would probably need a moving bar to keep the numbers of plans reasonable).",1263126740

It seems like in a lot of ways hydrogen would be an incredible fuel source, since as they say in the article it burns clean and at least in theory can be refueled like oil-based products.<p>From my understanding hydrogen&#x27;s biggest problem has been that it has to be delivered under pressure, which both makes it more dangerous/explosive, but also makes pumps and cars more expensive.<p>There was some talk in the mid 2000s about binding hydrogen into a chemical compound which makes it more stable, but not so stable that it is difficult to extract again (essentially giving it an diesel level of stability, rather than a water level of one). What happened to that?<p>Is this Toyota car another high-pressure hydrogen project or something new?",1429739954

You don&#x27;t pay them to show up, so you lose the conflict.<p>- The student is simply unaware that such resources are available in general, or available to him or her, specifically.<p>- The student has adopted compensation strategies to deal with an environment unsupportive of their goals.  Being invisible and anonymous may be one of them.  Wearing a &quot;mask personality&quot; in public may be another.<p>- The student is conditioned to believe that no one offers help without expecting something in return.  In some cases, accepting help is actually dangerous.  (Remember how I helped you out with your rent?  Good.  Hide this gun for me.  You owe me.)<p>Just use your position of perceived authority, and order them to show up.<p>If you teach an intro-level class, draw lots, and assign every one of your students to visit you during your office hours in a specific, scheduled, 10-minute window prior to midterms.  This is where you actually teach the student how to interact with professors outside the classroom.  With each student, talk a little about your class, and a little about anything else.  Make it a pass-fail item on the syllabus.  Show up?  Get some free course credit.  Don&#x27;t show?  0 points.

It is optimized for use cases where the insert/update rate is very high. In short, it has an LSM tree to quickly add new/updated records. At frequent intervals this LSM tree is merged into the on-disk pages.

It allows you to update the value of an entry by providing a merge function.

However, figuring out the most efficient program that&#x27;s equivalent to a given program also suffers from the halting problem, and that&#x27;s literally the definition of the goal of an optimizer.<p>So no: in general you cannot prove if an arbitrary variable will be accessed. However, you can, and will, take a conservative approach and narrow it down as much as possible.<p>In other words, if you can prove that it will be accessed before being assigned, great. If you can prove that it won&#x27;t be accessed before being assigned, great. If you can&#x27;t prove either...

It&#x27;s real hot down there, but not hot enough to run an engine, so it wasn&#x27;t gonna give em any power. They made a stab at power, up on the roof, with about a hundred Darrieus rotors, what they call eggbeaters. Had themselves a wind farm, see? Today they get most of their watts off the Fission Authority, like anybody else. But that geothermal water, they pump that up to a heat exchanger.

Bobby looked back. Shallow pools on the muddy concrete floor caught and reflected the limbs of the dwarf trees, the bare pale roots straggling down into makeshift tanks of hydroponic fluid.<p>&quot;Then they pump that into shrimp tanks, and grow a lot of shrimp. Shrimp grow real fast in warm water. Then they pump it through pipes in the concrete, up here, to keep this place warm. That&#x27;s what this level was for, to grow &#x27;ponic amaranth, lettuce, things like that. Then they pump it out into the catfish tanks, and algae eat the shrimp shit. Catfish eat the algae, and it all goes around again. Or anyway, that was the idea.

I was there on a Commonwealth scholarship (referred to by many at the time as &quot;Rhodes light&quot;) which paid for my tuition plus about £550/month of living expenses; this was enough to keep me alive, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t generous.<p>My friends were very obviously split into two groups -- poorer students from state schools who were first-generation Oxbridge attendees, and rich students from public (UK) or private (US) schools whose parents had been at Oxbridge or Ivy universities.  Academically, I fit in well with the wealthier crowd -- my parents both have Oxford degrees and doctorates, and I was there on an academic scholarship -- but financially I was far closer to the first-generation students.  On one memorable occasion I was invited to join a group for a weekend skiing in the Alps, and declined when I realized that it would cost me more than my rent for the month; and while all of my American friends flew home between terms (and often for long weekends in the middle of term), I stayed in Oxford over Christmas and Easter because the rent was cheaper than even the lowest-price plane tickets.<p>But I can&#x27;t fault Oxford for any of this: Indeed, the reason these socioeconomic strata were so obvious is precisely because they&#x27;re doing a good job of bringing in students from a wide range of backgrounds.  I never saw the University of my College doing anything which stigmatized or isolated students based on their background; the stratification was entirely due to the differences students brought to the university in how they saw the world and their places in it.",1429738530

Here&#x27;s some history of Pouillet from <a href=""http://documents.irevues.inist.fr/bitstream/handle/2042/16943/meteo_2008_60_36.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://documents.irevues.inist.fr/bitstream/handle/2042/1694...</a> :<p>> Claude Pouillet greatly contributed to the development of climate sciences by estimating the solar constant, i.e. the incoming solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere (also called total solar irradiance) ... He also evaluated the total absorption of solar radiation by the atmosphere.<p>Alas, it is in French and I am unable to read more than a few words of the language.<p>People who work in solar radiometry tend to come from astronomy, metrology, space science, and physics.<p>Your conceit (and I use that as the literary term; an &quot;extended metaphor with a complex logic&quot;) is that some E.T.s provide guidance that 1) elevated temperature in people is &#x27;very similar to the process in the human body&#x27;.<p>At best these E.T. are using Wittgenstein&#x27;s ladder, a.k.a. &quot;lies to children.&quot; This is about as true as saying that a pain on your stomach from a stomach ache is the same as a pain from appendicitis, is the same as the pain from taking a punch in the stomach. They all certainly cause pain in the belly, but the reasons for the pain, and the ways to resolve the pain, are very different.<p>The other part of the conceit is that 2) these E.T.s can say &#x27;Planetary temperatures are common when a species, typically a young one, upsets the balance&#x27;. This implies that temperature <i>increases</i> are a common result of upset, but <i>decreases</i>, or other sorts of ecosystem collapse, are not common.<p>I am not ignorant. I chose &#x27;Snowball Earth&#x27; precisely because it is <i>not</i> an ice age. Certainly these E.T.s must have come across cases on <i>other</i> <i>planets</i> where a new species ended up breaking the greenhouse effect that was keeping their ecosysem alive, and ended up with a snowball cascade.<p>Since the statements from this &#x27;wise group&#x27; of entites doesn&#x27;t pass a basic sniff test, they end up being straw puppets uttering only the words you think they should say.

It’s sad that this is still true for iOS, considering how Apple pioneered color management software in the 90s.<p>For folks with color vision deficiencies, we could probably do better than current displays, but there are several types of color vision deficiencies so it’s going to be pretty hard to satisfy everyone.",1429737630

There seems to be a tendency toward ad hominem comments against the go authors.<p>The article itself is a great read. I love hearing interesting and honest commentary about the language. But I wonder if comments like &quot;for reasons that appear to be political, does not have integer Min and integer Max functions&quot; are appropriate. Later the author mentions &quot;I get a similar sense of refusal-to-engage — the authors are communicative, to be sure, but in a didactic way.&quot;  If the go community (or the programming community at large) truly has the sense that the go authors are unwilling to engage with the users of the language, then that&#x27;s a big problem. However, are these sort of off the cuff comments the right way to start a discussion about it? At the very least, I wish that the author would provide specific evidence for these claims. I&#x27;m sure that there is some justification for them, but what the author is telling us is his inference, and I would appreciate an opportunity to read the source material and decide for myself. FWIW I have been programming in go for 2.5 years and made a few trips to the go-nuts mailing list. I don&#x27;t share the author&#x27;s impression, but I also haven&#x27;t read every thread on the mailing list.<p>That&#x27;s far from the worst of it, of course.

This is a direct consequence of some powerful Docker features. Specifically, Docker allows you to share a directory between the Docker host and a guest container; and it allows you to do so without limiting the access rights of the container. This means that you can start a container where the /host directory will be the / directory on your host; and the container will be able to alter your host filesystem without any restriction. This is similar to how virtualization systems allow filesystem resource sharing. Nothing prevents you from sharing your root filesystem (or even your root block device) with a virtual machine.<p>There&#x27;s certainly room to discuss &quot;is it possible to delegate hypervisor access without delegating root?&quot;, and &quot;can Docker get there from here?&quot;, but I think calling this an exploit is pretty far fetched.",1429737386

There is a bubble-like environment but I don&#x27;t think it equates to 1999 -- most of the high-value companies are doing fairly well, having either good exits (Whatsapp, Tumblr, Etsy), or raking in decent revenue (AirBnB) or having marketing executives fight over the chance to advertise (Snapchat, Pinterest).<p>As other folks have pointed out, VC firms have gotten rich and there is money to go around so the amount firms are being offered is a little higher than normal especially for late-stage rounds when it looks fairly sure that the company is on solid ground.<p>The housing boom on the other hand is simply an effect of not enough housing. Startups aren&#x27;t the major employer in Silicon Valley. The major employers are Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, LinkedIn etc -- all employing thousands of people, all generating loads of profit and they aren&#x27;t shutting down anytime soon; nor are they going to relocate anywhere in the near term.

All through life you will find that there are people with more, or fewer, resources than you have and interactions may be adversely affected by that.<p>The example of going out to dinner and then catching a movie is a good one. In a mid to large sized metropolitan area that is an expenditure of $40 - $100 (depending) and that can represent anywhere from .1% to 10% of a person&#x27;s take home pay. So people gravitate to socializing with folks who have the same sort of budget for recreational expenses.<p>And it can get even weirder when you&#x27;re wildly different in available resources. Consider the following illustrative example<p>Bob is a very high net worth individual, he owns an interest in a Gulfstream jet. While folks are hanging out they hear about a restaurant in Santa Fe (over 1,000 miles away) that is really great. Bob thinks it would be a great place to go for dinner. So he invites folks to dinner, when they show up everyone gets on the plane and flys to Santa Fe and eats at this restaurant which has been reserved (entirely) for this dinner.<p>Bob is trying to be friendly and help everyone share the experience of a restaurant they were just talking about. Except that everyone on the plane that wasn&#x27;t extremely wealthy felt really weird about the whole experience. (surreal might be better).<p>So its easy to be friends with Bob, he&#x27;s a nice guy, but it is hard to &quot;hang out&quot; with Bob as his idea of a reasonable idea of what to do next, can sometimes collide with your idea of reality.<p>That goes all the way down to things like skiing (fun, but expensive to do for the day).<p>To avoid that you need communities of people with similar resource levels, and yes this means that things like the 1st generation outreach program mentioned in the article will collect all of the &#x27;poor people&#x27; together, but it gives them a social structure to start from.

In the past they could monitor communications of a suspect and determine whether or not the suspicions were true. This has prevented a number of crimes - both drug related, mafia/gang/cartel related, and terrorist related. With encryption methods becoming commonplace - the government can no longer do what they have been doing and these once preventable crimes are becoming less preventable. Encryption is now too powerful and secure.<p>This is not a problem in and of itself. It&#x27;s a good thing for citizens too!

Sure, you can build programs to manipulate game clients to do all of those things. The problem is that there&#x27;s most often no legitimate way to openly bring the fruit of that labor to market as a result of the MDY vs Blizzard case regarding wowglider[1] and more specifically with the DMCA.<p>I wasn&#x27;t sued but paid for intellectual property counsel to examine how the Ninth Circuit ruling would translate across the US and they didn&#x27;t exactly tell me to go ahead.<p>There are plenty of legitimate reasons to extend games, which is why WoW had LUA and many other games are at very least hooked into for parsing capabilities. These kinds of 3rd party parsers are in many cases not legal, so not openly marketable.<p>So for anyone considering a future for-profit project, hire a lawyer and review all those nasty agreements and see how the DMCA might come back to haunt you before you&#x27;re <i>too</i> invested in it.<p>For anyone who&#x27;s considering it for fun: Just understand that the time you spend on gamehacking <i>probably</i> won&#x27;t result in a revenue-producing project. If you&#x27;re looking to learn, gamehacking can teach you a lot about a variety of things like memory (address space/pointers/offsets), rendering, assembly code, geometric and pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra/A*), pattern matching/signature scanning. Many of those things have real-world applications such as signature scanning for virus definitions. You&#x27;ll get plenty of hexadecimal math practice. You can learn about DirectX or network traffic. You can have really enjoyable learning experiences working with games at a lower-than-intended level, but keep in mind that any time not learning is only about as well-spent as time playing video games... it&#x27;s fun but incredibly addictive and they&#x27;re already at &quot;Pwn Adventure 3&quot; so there&#x27;s no end in sight!<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MDY_Industries,_LLC_v._Blizzard_Entertainment,_Inc.&oldid=646787903"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MDY_Industries,_LL...</a>",1429736573

The answer when you cannot cope is not to find a mechanism to cope, a crutch, but to just endure or execute the thing. It is about strength. Sometimes it&#x27;s about accepting things without a reason: what if one of your twins died? Exactly why is that &quot;bad&quot; per se? It feels like shit, yes, but all you can really say is that you currently do not want that. Petitioning someone for your desire is pure and simple. Making it into &quot;I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore so I felt too weak to be atheist&quot; is just covering over the fact that you really really wanted your wife and kids to be ok.<p>That is your religion then. It&#x27;s strong enough of a source of desire that you&#x27;d reach outside yourself to manipulate the universe itself if you had to, to cause the outcome you wanted. It could be said that is what the deity concept is. It&#x27;s a mutable global variable ( which is not threadsafe ) designed to circumvent your own individuality and provide a hack to route-around the system as it is, allowing you to not learn or grow, just have what you want.

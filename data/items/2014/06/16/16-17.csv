Actually, I read most of article wondering when he would get to discussing the absurd home-distilling laws.<p>Making beer, wine, etc is legal in most jurisdictions (with some out-there upper limit like 200 gallons per person per year max). Nothing wrong with drinking [most of] that stuff; with a little practice you can make it better than the cheap store-bought forms (or maybe even get actually good at it).<p>Distilling is simply removing some of the content of the aforementioned beverage. Usually it involves extracting the [harmless] ethanol from the fermented must/wort via evaporation & condensation, which can be done as simply as a &quot;disappearing still&quot; (arrangements of common kitchen pots, ice, and stove). Legally, &quot;distilling&quot; also includes other forms of concentrating the alcohol by removing something, such as by freezing the liquid and draining the still-fluid components from the ice. Either way, it&#x27;s pretty stupid that people can make vast amounts of inebriants at home for personal use, but are severely punished for concentrating it (again, for personal use).<p>Yes, some people do get stupid and make harmful solutions. A main factor therein is the fact that it&#x27;s illegal to make distilled spirits without expensive licenses, which in turns make it hard for people to make it properly & safely (both in manufacturing and product). Sure you could argue that they shouldn&#x27;t be doing illegal things, but that ignores the easy LEGAL availability (liquor stores flourish), and the fact that it&#x27;s so easy to make at home it&#x27;s almost hard not to.",1402936989

That&#x27;s ONE of the mechanisms society uses to accomplish things.  That&#x27;s not the only mechanism, and it&#x27;s certainly not the appropriate mechanism for many things.<p>I&#x27;ll give you a concrete example.<p>In my state, the Department of Transportation only plows snow from arterial roads, not from neighborhood roads.  In order to get snow plowed on a neighborhood street, residents have to organize a civic association that collects dues, and those dues are used to pay for plowing; the state then reimburses the civic association for a portion of its expenses.  But because membership in the civic associations is entirely voluntary, we end up with a 30 percent participation rate.  My share of the dues, in effect, pays for not only myself but two of my neighbors who aren&#x27;t willing to pay their fare share.<p>That is ridiculous.  It is a perfect example of a case in which it is simpler and fairer for a couple of bucks to be added to each household&#x27;s property taxes and have the plowing be publicly funded (although it could still be privately plowed).<p>Furthermore, the idea that the only role of the government is in situations where force is necessary is pretty darn limited.

And yet, eleven years later, it was repealed (thankfully).<p>But, and here&#x27;s the big but: To temper the temperance movement (which, by the way, had proven considerable political power), there were these crazy laws that were enacted to limit alcohol buying. The predecessor to the ATF was born [2]. And things like the 3-tier system were created, along with all sorts of bans on homebrewing and whatnot.<p>Essentially all of the regulations on alcohol have their roots in either the temperance movement or the anti-drunk driving movement (i.e.-MADD), which is a neo-temperance movement. Most of them were political concessions. Anymore, folks have profited tremendously off of artificial supply limitations, and they seek to keep those limitations in place by lobbying (quite effectively) against repeal or reform.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperance_movement_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperance_movement_in_the_Uni...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Alcohol,_Tobacco,_Firearms_and_Explosives#History"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Alcohol,_Tobacco,_Fi...</a>",1402935940

Example: you ask the grocery store clerk how to find a good cantaloupe, he/she shows them to you and shows you how to tell, you say &quot;the last few times I picked terrible ones&quot;, then you ask when they&#x27;re in season...etc<p>Other ideas:<p>-Older people tend to be nicer and more accommodating and less rushed. It could be worth trying to talk to older people who are less intimidating if they&#x27;re not in your peer group, and working your way down in age as you build confidence<p>-Do you even remotely like any sports? Can you handle a beer or two? Find a classy bar that&#x27;s not too crowded that plays sports games. Sit at the bar and watch and slowly drink your beers.

He had been banging the drums on insisting that the measured increase in low atmospheric temperatures had been an artifact of the heat island effect.  He insisted that if we take a closer look into the techniques climate scientists use to correct for the heat island effect, we would find that mean surface temperatures had been drastically overestimated.  He worked together with some folks to come up with a plan of attack to do just that, and off to the races we went.<p>So what did he do when the numbers came back and it turned out that climatologists had actually been <i>overcorrecting</i> for the heat island effect, with the result being that the study supported the exact opposite of his hypothesis?  He moved the goalpost, and carried on.<p>The whole episode really wasn&#x27;t much different from what we see with other junk scientists who&#x27;ve proven similarly capable of supporting an untenable position in the face of overwhelming evidence on the subject of the supposed vaccine-autism link, or whether or not dogs have ESP.  Any of these propositions may be true; in principle any scientific consensus can be overturned (and it has happened in the past).  But anyone who wishes to do so needs to be <i>extremely</i> scrupulous in how they assemble and present their arguments.  Folks like Lindzen, Watts, and Rutan simply haven&#x27;t proven themselves to be up to the task.

Draws a false equivalence between Hitler (who deliberately exterminated millions) and Churchill (whose &quot;policies&quot; were supposedly unintentionally &quot;responsible&quot; for the famine).  That&#x27;s outrageous even if the history were true.  In fact, it isn&#x27;t.  The article claims that &quot;Churchill could easily have prevented the famine.&quot;  This imbues Churchill with super-powers, and completely ignores the facts of the day: Bengal was a net importer of food and most of its food came from Burma, which had just been conquered by the Japanese.  Shipping food from Australia or other places might have been a solution, but Allied merchant shipping was under attack all over the world from the Japanese and German navies.  How would it have gotten there in time?  And why would that have been the default solution, when neighboring provinces in India had food surpluses and should have been the natural place to expect aid from.  The tehelka article also mendaciously suggests that &quot;Myanmar&quot; (a country which didn&#x27;t exist until the 1990s) offered to help feed Bengal, but the offer was kept secret by cruel British &quot;censors&quot;.<p>Any &quot;help&quot; from &quot;Myanmar&quot; would have come in the form of a conquering Japanese army.  Would they have brought some truckloads of rice with them from Burma?  Sure.  Would they have shared it with the Indians?  Probably not.  And despite the &quot;censors&quot;, I think the Japanese were pretty open about their willingness to conquer and enslave (er, &quot;help&quot;) the suffering Indians.  I would invite our Indian friends to ask the Chinese if that would have been a good deal.<p>The Wikipedia article on the 1943 famine is a much more serious read.",1402935088

I don&#x27;t give a damn what anyone thinks of my language choice, code style or lack of dress sense.<p>It&#x27;s funny -- in my (perhaps limited) experience, most of the &#x27;impossible egos&#x27; I&#x27;ve seen in the FOSS community belong to people who have similar concerns.  They have put a lot of effort into developing a project in a certain way, and are frustrated and annoyed when a Johnny-come-lately coder appears and demands they do something differently.  The attitude comes from needing to protect a successful project from &#x27;contributions&#x27; that, if unchecked, could ruin the code or the community.<p>It&#x27;s true that running a successful FOSS project requires managing <i>both</i> your code and your community.  You will never be able to <i>just</i> write good code if you want your project to thrive.  Maybe you&#x27;re not into that; that&#x27;s fine.  But, as you well know, that means you have to take on all of the tasks that a healthy FOSS community could otherwise help you out with, like testing, debugging, and writing documentation.<p>If you&#x27;re eventually hoping to be compensated for doing all that work yourself by selling copies of your software, you&#x27;re <i>still</i> going to have to do more than just write good code.  You&#x27;re going to have to market it.  Personally, I&#x27;d rather help manage a healthy development community than try my hand at marketing.  Again, maybe you feel differently, but the point is that there&#x27;s more to do than just write the code, unless you only care about using it yourself.

As a sometime professor, I was amazed that about 1/4th of students <i>just didn&#x27;t do the work</i> (and that&#x27;s of those who were in fact in the classroom, so the educational opportunity was right there).<p>Sending the unwilling to college doesn&#x27;t work.

If you mean the IRS or Benghazi as false stories then we would have a bit of a disagreement given the documents the gov has released and that whole e-mail story.<p>Yahoo is an aggregator for normal news and does have quite a bit of original content in selected verticals.  I will say they point to local papers that tend to get it right.  I don&#x27;t see any advantage to the &quot;putting it in context&quot; when it is such a prejudice and not-very-well-facted-check lens.

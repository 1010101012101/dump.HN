And when you already have in-house talent, it becomes even more obvious.<p>My only thought was that using a clustered database (such as Cassandra) as the store with the data itself might have been better.  domain/url (minus querystring) would hash/distribute fairly well, and with even a relatively small cluster with 2 replica nodes for the shard would be pretty effective.  Also, it would be easier to manage a replicated database, in my mind, than tracking sites to pairs of static servers.  GoDaddy is/was moving to something similar with new development on one of their applications when I worked there, and able to serve a huge number of static requests (hundreds of thousands per second) off of a relative few servers with a sub 10ms response time, for content not backed by cdn.<p>In the end it just goes to show that serving static content on modern hardware can scale <i>really</i> well, with a number of options for technology.

Restart sshd (service ssh restart), or restart the server.<p>4. Connect to the server setting a dynamic port forward. On linux or Mac, this is just &quot;ssh -D 8000 user@domain.com&quot;. On Windows, putty lets you set a dynamic port forward.<p>5. Personally I use Chrome for my real browsing, and then use Firefox for the proxy since it allows configuring a proxy for the browser only rather than the entire operating system. You just set the SOCKS proxy under advanced networking settings (host 127.0.0.1, port 8000).<p>6.

The problem though with saying most of the problems people have just require them to focus is that no one can measure other people&#x27;s internal struggle/pain.  We don&#x27;t have _really_ objective tests on this yet, we have inventories where you check a box.  Because of this, it honestly comes down to what someone can handle.<p>So this is the problem: I totally agree, if those things you said work for you great, but saying that most people don&#x27;t have hard-core mental illness is really bad is <i>really bad to say</i>.  In a world where it&#x27;s already hard for people to come forward that have this problem saying something like this is going to push people into the dark more - telling them that causes thought patterns like: &quot;well, most people don&#x27;t have this, so I probably don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s really unlikely, and you know, my friends have down periods too, I bet they&#x27;ve cut themselves before, it&#x27;s probably fine&quot;.<p>I know from experience.<p><i>PLEASE</i> don&#x27;t tell this to people, don&#x27;t promote this line of thought, don&#x27;t promote anything like this.  If you want to communicate what I think you&#x27;re trying to say, maybe this is a better way to put it:<p>&quot;For me, I&#x27;ve found exercise and diet have helped me feel better, but if someone feels like things are out of control they should see a doctor and see where they should go.&quot;",1432787753

As ONE example, what do you think Obama&#x27;s goals of a single-payer healthcare system are if not state ownership of healthcare?  What do you think the IRS&#x27;s control over your healthcare is if not state ownership.  If you think that is regulation, you have a very different definition of the word than I do.<p>Your second point is an appeal to probability fallacy.  You conclude that Obama blocked development of energy in America because companies wouldn&#x27;t develop energy responsibly, when there is no logical reason to make that assumption given that plenty of companies produce energy in non-destructive ways.<p>Your understanding of tax systems seems flawed.  There are many, many countries in the world, especially in the Soviet block region, that have implemented flat tax systems, have have enjoyed economic growth, and have not had the social unrest you claim comes with the territory.  Even in countries where the flat tax system hasn&#x27;t gone as well as hoped, other factors, such as government corruption, wasteful spending, high tax rates, etc. have been destructive elements that cannot be ignored.  This is all irrelevant, however, and simply a smokescreen to hide the fact that Obama&#x27;s is obsessed with taxing the rich (and the middle class) using Marx&#x27;s envy-based tax system.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what your point is on estate taxes.  Are you saying that if a bad policy only affects a small number of people then it is OK?  Or, do you mean to suggest if I don&#x27;t have $5.43 million in my estate I shouldn&#x27;t have an opinion on said bad policy?<p>I have better things to do that argue the obvious with someone who is obviously playing team sports. I&#x27;m surprised you didn&#x27;t find a way to fit Fox News or Rush Limbaugh into your argument. I am not a member nor a supporter of the GOP.  I am well aware that Obama has done nothing more than double down on Bush&#x27;s worst policies, while sprinkling his own brand of Marxist idealism on them in order to really polish the giant turd that is the federal government today.  How is this relevant?<p>I don&#x27;t support either of the big parties and suggest you and others consider doing the same.  Your civic duty isn&#x27;t a basketball game.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if you win or lose, as long as you vote for what is right.  Currently, I don&#x27;t believe correct governing principles exist in either of the major parties.

When you have to be on mood stabilizers and go through a lot of therapy to begin to not blame yourself for everything that your illness caused just because it&#x27;s invisible it can be a real setback to tell people and have them say &quot;Well you don&#x27;t look sick...&quot;<p>Same thing, ironically, happens to people with other chronic and non-visible illnesses: lupus, fibromyalgia, etc.  &quot;You don&#x27;t look sick - get off your ass&quot; - meanwhile their immune system is eating them from the inside out.<p>Anyways - to the original point - therapy can be very effective in treating anxiety and depression, but we should also not completely eliminate the possibility of SSRIs, MAOIs and related drugs for controlling depression.  The reality is that depression is often multifaceted and the biological and psychological components of it are mixed in ways we don&#x27;t entirely understand.  I know a lot of people that have required an antidepressant to be able to _deal_ with therapy, and then were able to discontinue slowly after they went through therapy.<p>People with more serious mental illnesses (<i>waves</i>) can be helped through counseling, but often will be dependent on medication for the rest of their lives - but counseling for these people can still result in a net benefit for society, as often we can contribute quite a bit (and many of us are very high functioning!) if we are given the opportunity.<p>Anyways - to parent - thanks for illustrating everything that is wrong with our society&#x27;s thinking about mental illness.  I will literally link people to your comment when I have to explain in the future :).  In all seriousness though, please get educated on this or study it more, I am hoping you&#x27;re just ignorant on this topic and not malicious or mean.",1432787332

A 10b5-1 plan is set of rules set up by someone, like a company exec, to trade stock even if that person holds inside information at the time of the trade. That is, you could set up a plan that automatically sells 100 shares of stock per month. You can NOT change the rules of the plan while you have inside information.<p>However, you CAN cancel plan orders even if you have inside info. For example, if you knew great news was coming, you could cancel a sell order. If I understand it, this is because courts have ruled that insider trading laws can only be applied when a trade occurs, not when one doesn&#x27;t occur.

It is quite the opposite in most situations. The competition between companies is fierce. Several companies may have competing similar products, each with their own patents.<p>I help companies look at patents and find ways to design around the claims or just invalidate them. You would be surprised how often we succeed.<p>Look at cell phones, there are numerous patents on cell phones, apps, communication technologies, and so on. Yet, there is no lack of choice. We are buried in choice.<p>Also, I advise my clients to think of every way their invention can be made, including the terrible ways. Many times, the competing, non-patented product will be inferior to the patented product, yet not infringing the claims. The inferior product may just have better marketing. The consumer is usually not an expert in the field and must rely on advertising claims and dubious good reviews.<p>It is my opinion that patents create constant disruption and competition, which is healthy for the market; and ultimately provides better choice for the consumer. Perfect designs, like paper clips, enjoy 20 years of protection, then eventually become commodities. While imperfect designs will be exploited by the competition, with design-arounds and improvements. And there are very few perfect designs.<p>Finally, I mainly work with small companies that wish to compete against large companies. They do not wish to be the free R & D lab for the larger company. A patent may allow a small company to compete against the overwhelming resources of a large company; hopefully creating jobs and wealth at the same time. It is still a very hard path that few can navigate. Patents are just one tool to make business a little easier.",1432786666

Self driving cars are about converting wasted time during commutes into more time on the net.

It was a chess move. It built an ice wall between Apple&#x27;s employees and Google&#x27;s recruiters.<p>Google hires executives, directors, and managers -- positions based upon experience. Factoring out Apple, who else has this kind of talent? Microsoft.<p>Microsoft, whose former CEO famously hated Silicon Valley and built a company around this ethos. Whose very soul grates on the fluid agility that embodies the Bay Area.

I&#x27;m willing to go thermonuclear war.&quot;<p>The author of the Fox Business article claims that &quot;it all started when Schmidt turned the company over to Page and Brin.&quot;<p>This is false. Schmidt didn&#x27;t turn the company over to Page and Brin; he turned it over to Ballmer and Gates.<p>In other words: Google isn&#x27;t flailing because engineers work on cool projects.

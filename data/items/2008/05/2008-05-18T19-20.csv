I wouldn't qualify your site as ""awesome"" just yet.<p>You should get on the front page of Digg by doing something noteworthy, not try to make your thing noteworthy by getting on the front page of Digg. That's backwards.<p>edit: If there was a trivial way to get on the front page of Digg then anyone would do it and said site would become worthless. In fact it's a bit like your site, the barrier to entry is so insanely low any spammer can and does take advantage of it so why bother with it? The spam problem should be one of your top priorities right now.",1211140648

193552,comment,193440,193440,0,0,arete,,,"Most operating systems have some highly efficient way of handling many open network connections, for example epoll on linux, kqueue on xBSD, event ports on solaris. These are much more efficient than select() with large numbers of open sockets and the Erlang VM will use the appropriate one for the host OS when run with the +Ktrue option.<p>The SMP Erlang VM (as of Erlang/OTP R11B, R12B highly recommended) runs, by default, one process scheduler per CPU. So on a dual-core machine you can have two sockets being read from/written to simultaneously. Erlang allows you to program to a very simple model of one Erlang process per socket, with the VM using select/epoll/kqueue/etc to determine which processes have incoming data and are thus runnable.<p>Native processes use a lot of resources on most operating systems, so you can't use a process-per-socket model. So many web servers use a pool of processes/threads and queue up incoming requests that exceed that limit. Others use relatively few processes and use epoll/kqueue/etc directly.",1211139974

Startup school left me with a feeling I have not experience before....  It's hard to fully articulate, but perhaps ""thrilling"" is the best adjective.  Founders I met dream big, they're excited, and those feelings are contagious.<p>Am I crazy?  Are startup founders really as excited as perceived?  My primary fear is a selection effect.  Those interested and excited in startups, attend things like startup school, those who feel bitter, tired, or bored with startups, don't.<p>Still, the same could be said of academic conferences, yet, I have never felt the same air of excitement at one.  Why?  Am I missing something?  Did anyone else experience the same sensation?  Anyone interested in sharing their thoughts?<p>I'm utterly confused.  It's easy to drone on with my own hyperbole here.  I guess I'd rather hear yours.  :)",1211139413

193542,comment,193284,193346,0,0,iloveyouocean,,,"Its interesting that in response to: ""A YC company to -REVOLUTIONIZE- the food industry?""(emphasis mine) the posts center around why its not profitable, not possible, not desirable, etc.<p>Wow, a regular bunch of free-thinking, revolutionaries around here.  Sad.<p>How about this:  A company that helps educate and organize individuals and groups for cooperative food production.  Sort of a distributed CFA(community farm alliance) except that a group combines its production resources to form a 'virtual farm'.  And in turn, 'virtual farms' can trade in a 'virtual market'.  The production could scale from the individual, to the group, to the meta-group, etc.<p>The premise is that an individual signs up and perhaps that person is already involved in some type of food production.  Based on their location and what they are producing, they are assigned to contribute to a group of people producing other, complimentary goods.  This group meets up and exchanges their produce so that they regularly have a good variety of vegetables etc.<p>Alternately, an individual can sign up and be assigned a certain production item.  The site has extensive information resources, and trained farmers, agricultural engineers etc. that can be used for resources.  Also, other members from local groups can help this individual if they are knowledgeable, etc.<p>Alternately, groups of people can choose to all produce the same vegetables and then trade them to other groups.<p>The site could invest in community garden plots and charge a small fee for the use of the soil, tools, knowledge base, etc.  and in this way allow city/apartment dwellers to participate.<p>This site would be geared towards non-professional farmers that are still interested in local, organic food production.  But perhaps it could scale to be larger.<p>Perhaps this isnt exactly, 'revolutionizing the food industry', but if the millions of people spending hours a day on social networks, etc.  spent some of their time participating, this could seriously impact food production for many people.
I dont know, just off the top of my head, but surely its better to at least TRY to come up with an idea, rather than list off all the reasons its not possible or too hard.",1211138999

Every year, interns who are incoming seniors are invited to Bill Gates's house for a barbeque, and I was lucky enough to be able to go. At that time Google was so hot -- radically new and good, we thought, practically a developer's paradise -- but Bill kept saying that they were just the ""media darling"" of the moment. He said he'd seen it before, and soon enough Google would be just another company. A lot of the interns at Microsoft that year were probably rejected from Google -- maybe even <i>most</i> of us. ""You just don't understand"", we were thinking, ""Google is different"". There was no way <i>Bill Gates</i> could understand, of all people. But actually he was totally right.",1211138885

193531,comment,193284,193452,0,0,jacobolus,,,"> <i>It's just a series of quotes from crazy people who tell us we're all going to die</i><p>Actually none of them say that, nor are any particularly crazy.  What they do say is that the global agricultural system is slow to react to changes, and when it does, it often dramatically overreacts, which can cause large-scale famine.  They also say that “western” society has promoted an incredibly wasteful agricultural system which produces vast quantities of extremely unhealthy food, in the process sickening consumers and destroying landscapes.<p>Anyway, going directly to the sources (e.g. Pollan: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/magazine/28nutritionism.t.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/magazine/28nutritionism.t....</a>) is more useful than this New Yorker article.<p>> <i>Another of my pet peeves is when people criticize the ""Western"" system of doing something without providing any contrast with an ""Eastern"" way of doing it.</i><p>It's just a way of lumping Western Europe and the US behind one generic name.  In this case, the contrast is not with an “Eastern” way, but with a “developing country” way.",1211137738

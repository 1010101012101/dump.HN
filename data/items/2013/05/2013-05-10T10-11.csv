is:<p><pre><code>     We must ask: why are you seeking
     venture funding?

     o    The business seems capable of
          bootstrapping to success.

     o    You claim to have a successful
          exit behind you.  Why not fund
          it yourself?
</code></pre>
Good points.  My guess is that with the amazing
improvement of the ratio of price and performance of
computer server hardware and Internet bandwidth,
more and more entrepreneurs will just bootstrap
their startups.<p>Second there is:<p><pre><code>     However, none of our funds are
     currently in an investment mode, so
     we won't be investing.  So why did we
     take the pitch?

     o    Because an hour of our time
          doesn't really cost that much.

     o    We just wanted to hear what was
          going on in the industry, and
          it's cheaper for companies to
          come to us, than for us to go to
          conferences.

     o    We have a company in our
          portfolio that is in your space,
          and we're going to help them by
          passing them your business plan
          and your best ideas! Sorry.
</code></pre>
Some VCs may do these things or somethings close to
them.<p>There are two problems, not just with the form
letter but US information technology venture
capital:<p>First there are the definitions:<p><pre><code>     o    You're pre-seed because you have
          an idea but no prototype or
          users.

     o    You're seed stage because you
          have a prototype or some
          nonpaying users, but no scalable
          way to convert those users to
          revenue.

     o    You're early stage because you
          have revenue, but are not yet
          profitable.

     o    You're growth stage because you
          have hit cash-flow-positive, but
          only in a small market, and you
          want to roll out new products
          and services to new markets.

     o    You're pre-IPO because you've
          got a solid track record of
          dominating your market.
</code></pre>
A problem here is that the list assumes that the
company will go to market with just a prototype.
Bummer.<p>These definitions of pre-seed and seed assume that
the product development needed and deserved no
equity funding and is done but somehow is still not
nearly enough for a going business and the project,
for a business, still needs equity funding.  That
view cannot hold very often for projects that have
the potential VCs need.  Really this view is being
lazy, that is, just don't look at the product and,
instead, look at 'traction' in the market.<p>Of course, there will occasionally be, for whatever
reasons, good, bad, or otherwise, some cases of
promising startups that have everything done but
need some 'go to market' equity funding, but more
and more in information technology such cases will
in niches.<p>Second, there is<p><pre><code>     Typically we look for:

     o    a fundamental innovation in
          technology or business model.

     o    we're looking for someone who
          lives at the frontier of
          innovation in their field, and
          knows where the puck is going.
</code></pre>
Nearly no US information technology venture partners
are either willing or able to evaluate such
considerations.<p>We have to keep in mind:  Surprisingly, shockingly,
US VCs are doing poorly making money.  I.e., on
average they are failing at business.  Two telling
examples:<p>(1) As in Fred Wilson's post of<p><pre><code>     Feb 21, 2013

     Venture Capital Returns
</code></pre>
at his<p><pre><code>     http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/02/venture-capital-returns.html
</code></pre>
over the past 10 years, early stage US venture
capital on average has had return on investment
(ROI) less than the S&P 500.<p>(2) As in remarks on venture capital at the Web site
of Peter Theil's The Founders Fund, at<p><pre><code>     http://www.foundersfund.com/the-future

features, widgets, irrelevances.  In large part, it

What basis do you have for assuming that it's a linear growth over the entire period?<p>As you see, that 1997 data point is very high. The Yahoo Finance link I gave notes ""The high number of expatriations that year is thought to be a result of Hong Kong reverting back to Chinese sovereignty, according to tax attorney Andrew Mitchel. Chinese citizens are not allowed to have dual citizenship, so many Hong Kong residents renounced their U.S. citizenship prior to Hong Kong joining China in 1997, so they would become fully Chinese citizens."" You might be able to verify that a bit by looking to see if there's a higher number of Chinese sounding names for that year.<p>In any case, remove that first data point and you'll see that the trend is much more pronounced and statistically significant. Because you have so few data points, any analysis will be sensitive to a single large outlier like that one.<p>You'll should also investigate if there were similar effects elsewhere. Why, for example, was there a seeming slump in 2006-2008?<p>You'll also need to compare your linear model to other models. The one proposed by many is that the tax and enforcement changes around 2010 caused a big reaction. Can you model that piece-wise?<p>Also, there are many factors which affect the numbers. The rate of US citizens who renounce citizenship in order to take on high office in another country should be about the same, compared to those leaving for tax reasons, so you should be subtracting some baseline for that.<p>With this few data points, and with a complicated underlying system, it's basically impossible to make a valid statistical interpretation.

Extrovert enjoy social interaction and need it as part of their ""energy"", while introverted people will see the same kind of interaction take a toll and thus need time alone. Carl Kingdom explains very will what introversion is about [1]. Also, remember that introversion / extroversion isn't a binary trait but a whole spectrum of behaviours. 
If OP lacks empathy and feels the need to exploit other people to his own benefit, then chances are that he has psychopathic traits. That doesn't mean he's a serial killer or that it should be taken as an insult.

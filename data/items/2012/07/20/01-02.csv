4269017,comment,4268525,4268895,5,0,kstrauser,,,"For vertical scaling, PostgreSQL is generally seen to be much faster. That varies by workload, of course, and I'm sure you could tailor a benchmark that shows MySQL to be dramatically faster than PostgreSQL. But in every benchmark or sample set I've come across, PostgreSQL tends to scale linearly with the number of processor cores and handles ridiculously unlikely concurrency demands with ease. MySQL has a reputation, deserved or not, for being fast for single-connection, read-only workloads but not so quick when writes or multiple users are added in. Under load, PostgreSQL seems to be faster than the quick-but-dangerous MyISAM MySQL table type, and almost always faster than the slow-but-safer InnoDB table type.<p>I can't speak to horizontal scaling, as my little database with maybe 50 million rows never comes close to loading out its aging 4-core server, even when being hammered by lots of web visitors running complicated reports and internal clients performing all sorts of CRUD operations.",1342749563

Why can't you just have a blog? I've probably been linked a dozen or so blogs inside that network (always from HN, I've never noticed traction anywhere else), but at no point has there been any cross promotion, so the fact that it was inside svbtle barely seemed to matter.<p>On 'barely': so far the fast majority of posts that have come out of svbtle have not actually been very good, and the curated 'we are the cream of the internet crop' pretentious feeling you get is not that positive.<p>Basicially, for me, a blog being inside svbtle seems to have negligible effect, and that effect is a negative one.<p>Maybe I'm missing the point though.",1342749472

You have to remember that for investors it's all about IRR. That kind of IRR on the 1 out of 10 investments that gets to that level isn't interesting to any real investor. Your focus on profit and dividends is misguided.

I hated almost everything I found.  I felt so trapped, I started looking at US Army POW survival manuals for clues on dealing with stress and fear.<p>Since then I've been hoping to write something or develop a website that would help another person going through a tough time (of any sorts) get through it successfully.  Not sure how I would monetize it, but it would be cool if I could come up with a way to bring some sense to the self-help market.<p>Since I don't have training in counseling or psychology I even thought about going for the one year Master of Positive Psychology program at UPenn, but of course dropped the idea as it would add to my debt.<p>Anyway, that's the only idea I have had and only topic I really have passion for at the moment.<p>Maybe if I did some exploratory research on different things I could come up with some more areas I'd be interested in.<p>But I need to move fast as I'm terrified of defaulting on my bills when the year is out.",1342749355

Their job is not to do any particular work exactly, but to coordinate the work of others and to get the actual employees focused on doing the boring dreck work that nobody really would do by choice.<p>Think about it this way, there are long standing issues in many leaderless Open Source projects because people more or less just work on what they want and boring crap like writing drivers, or making button graphics or whatever. That's why the ones that tend to be successful tend to be the ones that have strong leadership structures.<p>Problems crop up in a couple different cases:<p>1) The size of the group the manager has to coordinate is larger than the manager can actually handle. This results in all kinds of obvious problems I don't think I need to get into.<p>2) More subtly, and this is where large corporations end up stagnating and dying. It's when the ""meta"" aspect gets out of control and there are managers of managers of managers.<p>In this case what happens is that in order to communicate information up the managerial structure, the data necessarily has to become more and more abstract until it often loses so much meaning as to be almost entirely divorced from reality. The side effect of this is that <i>somebody</i> has to produce the abstractions which ends up being the lower levels of the management hierarchy...which of course means that they're no longer functioning in a coordination role as their data reporting role ends up consuming more and more of their time.<p>3) In large management chains, decision and vision authority tends to move up the hierarchy towards the top, which of course is the part of the hierarchy operating with the least amount (most abstract) of data...and the issues highly abstract ""vision statements"" that then must be resolved down through the management chain and end up turning in unmotivated ""orders"" that the lower level coordinators have no real buy in on -- ending up with unmotivated and uncreative solutions to ensure that the ""boxes are checked"" and satisfy their fraction of the ""vision statement"". Success in this area is then reported back up the chain as more and more abstract data.<p>#3 is why large companies usually end up stagnating and ending up uncreative.",1342748131

4268948,comment,4268525,4268792,19,0,rosser,,,"I mentioned something about this the last time a discussion involving Django and Postgres came up, but it bears repeating.<p>If your environment is set up such that database connections are long-lived, <i>please</i> double-check that you're not using SQLAlchemy's default behavior to open an explicit transaction (e.g., ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"") upon connection. (It may no longer be the default, but it was last I worked with a Django shop, ~two years ago, now.) That behavior interferes with VACUUM's ability to do its job, your tables can bloat linearly with how ""write-hot"" they are, and performance of queries using those tables will reflect that.<p>Briefly, this is a consequence of Postgres' MVCC (multi-version concurrency control) architecture. Physically, an UPDATE statement is an atomic INSERT/DELETE operation; each version of every row is stored on disk, and Postgres keeps track of which versions of which rows are ""visible"" in the context of which transactions. Obviously, that's not a sustainable approach, both in terms of performance, and resource consumption. You'll fill up your storage with ""dead"" tuples, and you'll have to trawl through disk page after disk page of them to find a single ""live"" one.<p>Enter VACUUM and later, the autovacuum daemon. They know which transactions are open, and which versions of rows were modified by which transactions. ""Dead"" tuples older than any open transaction are truly dead, and their disk footprint can be re-used by subsequent INSERT  or UPDATE operations.<p>SQLAlchemy's (former?) default behavior to open an explicit transaction upon connection isn't ideally suited for use with MVCC-based databases (so if you're using InnoDB, you'll probably have some flavor of this same problem)  particularly if your environment has connections open for <i>days</i> at a time, which was the case at that former gig.<p>When I found this problem in their stack, tables with hundreds, or perhaps a few thousand rows had disk footprints in the gibibytes. They were among the hottest tables in the system and performance, consequently, sucked. The only thing that kept them alive was that the people they had working on this stuff before me had a weekly maintenance window (site outage) where they ran a VACUUM FULL and REINDEX. How no-one twigged to the fact that app performance followed a perfect sawtooth pattern with a period of exactly one week, lock-step in phase with the maintenance cycle, I'll never understand...<p>You can check whether your environment is configured this way with:<p><pre><code>  SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE current_query = '<IDLE> in transaction' ORDER BY xact_start;\n</code></pre>\nIf any of those guys are older than ... not very old at all (seconds, perhaps minutes at the outside, but that's a function of how your stack works, and only you can really say what's abnormal) then, Houston, you have a problem.<p>A caveat: this test is fairly specific, but somewhat less sensitive, with false negatives being possible. What you're really looking for is Postgres backends with an xact_start current transaction start time  that is (potentially significantly) out of line with how long your normal database operations should take. Those usually show up as ""<IDLE> in transaction"" but you could very well happen to run the above query exactly when one of these offending connections is busy servicing a query, itself...<p>EDIT: clarifications",1342748038

But I also felt it implied an assumption that technical people don't need to prove anything.  It gets very tiring reading articles that imply that tech people are all highly valuable, and that business people should feel lucky to be chosen as their partners.  At our company, Yotam and I accomplished mountains of work while our first 3 tech-founder candidates produced nothing and wasted our time.<p>It's also terribly inaccurate to say that <i>""most technical people can, over time, ""figure out the business stuff"" to a far greater degree than most business people can ""figure out the technical stuff""</i>.  If ""figuring it out"" is akin to having a basic understanding, I think many great business founders have proven they can learn to code on a basic level.  Similarly, developers may also learn the basics of business development, sales or fundraising by reading some articles.  And, maybe one more than the other.  But just as figuring out the basics of coding does not make you a valuable developer, learning the basics of business does not suddenly empower a person with the ability to ask the right questions, communicate clearly, create mutual value between partners, close a sale, negotiate terms, save a furious client, and so on.<p>Being moderate at any of these things does not a great founder, or company, make.  Implying that techs can somehow become good at these things in droves, or easily at all, is drastically underestimating what a true business leader is capable of.",1342746635

I write tests, measure coverage, do continuous testing (including load testing and resource consumption goals) and the fancy technologies that allow me to target different databases with the same source code are nothing new: SQL and an ORM. I consider the fact the code isn't very tied to a given database implementation is a sign of high quality, not the other way around.<p>No doubt this app will appeal to the more casual developers.

As I grew up I held that dream tightly, deciding to first go to engineering school (a tiny school), where I got my bachelors and masters degrees.<p>I was hired right out as a product manager at a software company and I did that for four years, hoping to learn how products get made and sold.<p>After a few years I wanted to learn more about business, and was encouraged by those around me to go to business school for an MBA.<p>I did that, without thinking hard enough about the debt that I would be taking on or for that matter the debt I had already.  I went to an alright school (top 100), I had a low GMAT (entrance exam) score and I graduated with average grades (3.44/4.00 GPA).  I did not do an internship, due to an illness.<p>I then got married, and took on my wifes debt (she got a masters degree in writing and makes barely anything as a professional writer).  Added to that I came down with a psychiatric illness; this cut into the MBA career prep, and kept me from making strong interpersonal connections.  While Im fine now, I had to use credit cards to stay afloat and pay the bills for a while.<p>All told, Im $400k in debt and living with the in-laws.  If I made a $100,000 salary at a high paying job it would just get me by.  Right now I have a years supply of cash (on a ramen budget), a place to stay and no kids.  I have a lot of free time as Im still unemployed.<p>Part of me wants to use this desperation right now to try and start a project, develop a product and try to make a fortune off it.<p>The more logical part of me wants to find a ridiculously high paying job (well over $100,000), although my experience so far has given me significant doubts anything like that exists for someone who has been out of the workforce for coming up on four years and was not a stellar MBA student.<p>So Im asking for some advice for going forward (Im well aware I didnt make the right choices in the past and that I didnt have the best luck).<p>PG says the best way to get rich is to do a startup.  But he doesnt say what the best way to get rich is for people with a heavy debt load (if there is a way).<p>I want to get rid of this debt ASAP and Im wondering what out-of-the box ways people can think of (if there are any).<p>Thanks in advance for your comments.",1342746297

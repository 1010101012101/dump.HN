7430083,comment,7427189,7428516,2,0,leggetter,,,"It has come out of enterprise focused development - there&#x27;s no getting away from that. And we have enterprise customers that the toolkit has to support.<p>However, enterprise is in a state of convergence right now. Those that would not previously work at &quot;Enterprise&quot; orgnisations are providing great value there. Those that have been part of the web development community for some time will hopefully attest to that.<p>So, what we&#x27;re trying to do with BRJS is follow that convergence; and be part of it. Some software engineering concepts traditionally associated with enterprise shouldn&#x27;t be dropped simply because of this association. Similarly techniques and tools that wouldn&#x27;t have been found in the enterprise shouldn&#x27;t be dismissed because they don&#x27;t conform to the expected stereotypes.<p>For example:<p>- encapsulation\n- separation of concerns\n- interfaces (In JavaScript: arrgghhhh!) - think contracts (function names and signatures). We&#x27;ve had lots of discussions about this but them continue to delivery value when building a maintainable app\n- services via an IoC/Dynamic Service Locator (see Angular)\n- PubSub - hopefully Addy Osmani and a number of other solutions have done enough to clarify why this is useful<p>All these ring of enterprise. But they&#x27;re actually just good and simple software engineering practices.<p>When building large JavaScript apps it&#x27;s about getting the balance right and we&#x27;re hoping that as part of this open sourcing project we can do that.<p>One obvious thing that will still stand out as needing improvement are the deep directory structure (from Java). This is high on our list of improvements. We also only export to a WAR right now, but flat file export is also a high priority.",1395248312
7430082,story,,,5,4,PartnerUp,"Looking for a cofounder role? Join me; I've already got the ball rolling",,"TL,DR: Longtime reader, throwaway account. Started e-commerce company solo a while ago and planning to join an accelerator soon. Looking to ante-up by adding 1-2 people (ops/marketing and possibly tech) on mutual trial basis to start. I&#x27;m generalist (design business & some tech).<p>More: I recently established an art-focused e-commerce startup, centered on redefining discoverability with a twist and direct sales of unique goods from indie designers. Planning to join an accelerator soon and would love to have a team in order to grow and capitalize on the program&#x27;s resources and connections.<p>Rather than speed dating and swiftly declaring love until death do us part, I figured an extended dating trial of a few months might be more practical. Compensation could be structured as stipend paid during the accelerator period followed by negotiated equity (on vesting schedule) if both parties agree to continue working together. Possibility for full salary when the startup gets funding (or reaches applicable sales milestone first).<p>I&#x27;m open to partners from anywhere, as long as you can relocate to North America to participate in accelerator and possibly stay afterwards (open to half remote/virtual then, preferably within same timezone).

7430071,comment,7427542,7428273,5,0,bgarbiak,,,"<i>having some experience with unions by hearing stories and watching the news</i><p>That&#x27;s not really an experience, is it? Yeah, I heard lot of dark stories about unions as well (corruption, nepotism, violence, dirty politics, mafia connections - usually it&#x27;s one out of these), and there&#x27;s a lot to improve but then again: unlike governments and corporations unions don&#x27;t own powerful media outlets to fix their PR, do they? Also, who says the developers&#x27; union has to be like the other unions. After all we are the people who &quot;think different&quot;.<p>Anyway, just take a look how it works in Hollywood. Basically the only profession there which doesn&#x27;t have its strong union/guild are the special effects people. And while the movie mega-corporations make billions on superhero franchises the FX companies go bust one after another.[1][2]\nDo you remember the Writers&#x27; Strike?[3] The corporations agreed to share their profits with writers only after 12 000 union members were striking for over 3 months.<p>Another example: the case of Julie Ann Horvath at GitHub. She asked HR to be a mediator between her and the company&#x27;s founder[4]. She cried during that meeting and HR did nothing. I wouldn&#x27;t blame them, they too risked their employment there.  That&#x27;s unions job, that what unions are needed for: to protect you from your employer.<p><i>In the end, it&#x27;s a harsh world we live in and we have to cope with it.</i><p>So, why don&#x27;t we make things a bit easier for ourselves? Historically, every major technological advancement (industrial revolution, introduction of cars, and so on) poured vast new wealth into the hands of entrepreneurs and investors, while common workers either lost their jobs or had to work much harder. That&#x27;s when unions were &quot;invented&quot;, that&#x27;s when eight-hour working day was fought for[5] - basically that&#x27;s when current shape of the Western society was molded. We have various means that protect the existence of the middle class[6] to this day. Yet, we now observe a new industrial revolution and - that amazes me - the hard-workers that propel this revolution are voluntarily waiving their most valuable rights. Not only that, they (we!) are more eager to defend billion dollar corporations&#x27; not paying a cent of taxes than to ask for medical aid for a colleague.<p><i>software developers are amongst the most adaptable people of all industries</i><p>When you&#x27;re 40-50, got over 20 years of experience, two kids in high school/college and a mortgage the last thing you ever want is to adapt to a new line of work and start from scratch.

Over the last 7 years it&#x27;s gotten less and less relevant as a way of releasing vulnerabilities, because large public mailing lists are not a particularly effective way to publish vulnerabilities.<p>People seem to believe that happened because vulnerabilities started to obtain a market value, but:<p>* The serious high-end memory corruption vulnerabilities were (a) more common and (b) much simpler at FD&#x27;s inception, making them more amenable to posting on a list; in 2014, a high-end vulnerability is likely to be complex enough to merit in-depth consideration on a blog instead.<p>* Table-stakes XSS vulnerabilities also tend to get written up in blogs (where they help establish a track record for researchers whose future employers aren&#x27;t going to trawl through FD looking for them), and when they get bought, get bought by bug bounties. It is hard to argue that bug bounties are a bad thing; nobody benefits from a web vulnerability in a SaaS product other than the operator of the SaaS product.",1395248242
7430063,comment,7429793,7429888,2,0,jonnathanson,,,"I voted &quot;hero,&quot; along with what seems like everyone else on this site. But I would have voted somewhere below that tier if the option existed. To me, &quot;Hero&quot; is too strong a choice to characterize my feelings, but &quot;Neutral&quot; is too weak.<p>I am not sure what a word like &quot;Neutral&quot; means in this context. Does it mean I don&#x27;t have an opinion? Does it mean I don&#x27;t really care about the topic? Does it mean I&#x27;m still making up my mind? Does it mean I&#x27;d put my opinion of him at somewhere between 4 and 6 on a 10-point value scale? My point is, &quot;Neutral&quot; is a single value attempting to capture a wide range of possibilities, many of which are orthogonal or even contradictory to each other. Each of those possibilities is a valid choice, but because few people will look at &quot;Neutral&quot; from the same perspective, fewer people will select it. (That&#x27;s just my guess, at any rate.) Its range of semantic meaning is so broad as to become almost meaningless.<p>I would describe my opinion as &quot;The ends were valid, but they don&#x27;t seem to justify leaping to the means that Snowden used. On the balance, however, he did what needed to be done.&quot; Our system offers whistleblowers a range of options incrementally less extreme than the course of action he took. Maybe he&#x27;d already tried to go down that road? Maybe he feared he&#x27;d be taken down before he could air things through legitimate channels? Not sure. I don&#x27;t feel that I have enough background information to make that call.<p>Tl;dr - If &quot;1&quot; is &quot;He&#x27;s the devil incarnate,&quot; and 10 is &quot;He&#x27;s the best thing for our country since Abe Lincoln,&quot; I guess I&#x27;d rate him a 6-7.

They need work, but the installed base is huge, so it&#x27;s a hard problem. The solution is probably to build a layer on top of all that to simplify it, much like jQuery did with incompatible DOM implementations.<p>So far, a number of companies are doing well with abstracting the protocol layer away to make focusing on building good apps easier (see mailgun.com for SMTP, context.io for IMAP, etc).<p>As to Threadable&#x27;s long-term strategy, it goes further. :) Right now, we&#x27;re building a great mailing list. As it gets further along, we plan to make it into a platform so that other app developers can use us to do all the difficult parts of managing threaded discussions, client compatibility, etc. The idea is to turn every app and website&#x27;s isolated comment stream into a threaded email discussion, so people can engage using the tools they&#x27;re already used to.<p>There&#x27;s already millions upon millions of mailing lists out there, but nobody&#x27;s made major changes in this space in a decade or more. We think we can add enough value that people will be happy to pay for it, and make group email collaboration more popular at the same time.<p>Our overall goal is the engagement and inclusivity that comes from making key information available in the way that people expect.

You can&#x27;t change your age, but you can change how you present yourself.<p>Your problem is one of marketing. You&#x27;re putting your age front and center in your entire persona. This is a huge mistake. Your resume is large and hard to sift through, and many of your listed skills don&#x27;t necessarily seem relevant anymore. This only exacerbates the problem.<p>I recommend a vast simplification to the way you present yourself online and to employers. Completely eliminate the OldCoder persona. Eliminate all drama--don&#x27;t mention family problems or reasons for leaving past jobs.<p>When applying to jobs, always produce a short resume that is custom-made for that company. This might not be necessary for a fresh college graduate, but when you have 30 years of experience built up you have to learn to present the aspects of your experience that are most relevant to the employer and nothing else.<p>Don&#x27;t concern yourself so much with finding a perfect match. You&#x27;re not really in a position right now to only consider jobs that seem perfect for you.<p>Brush up on algorithms.<p>Finally, if you are in severe financial trouble, it is plain folly to limit your search to one geographic area. Scared 18 year old kids move cross country for college. You can move for a job. From experience I can say that ageism is less prevalent outside of Silicon Valley. Companies in medium-sized cities also receive fewer resumes, which means there&#x27;s less competition, which means you have a much better chance at standing out if you learn to present yourself in a compelling way.",1395246904

7429825,comment,7427189,7428050,1,0,leggetter,,,"It&#x27;s mainly a re-write of the older toolkit. Open sourcing has many benefits.<p>As lead of the open sourcing initiative (not lead-dev) it&#x27;s been an opportunity to re-evaluate what we&#x27;re doing and a way to identify things that may change in the future e.g. we used to write JS in along namespaced style. This was - to be honest - nasty. We now use a node.js style, but because we&#x27;ve identified that as something that could change, we have a plugin for that area which means we can move to ES6 or TypeScript if we want to in the future.<p>It&#x27;s also been a great way to look at what else is out there, can it address our needs and how can we incorporate it. The obvious thing here is Node.js v Java. We originally chose to write our toolkit in Java as Node.js wasn&#x27;t around and later on because Node.js wasn&#x27;t an option for our customers. That&#x27;s changing so we&#x27;re looking at Node.js integration. We obviously want our own developers and those of our customers to be able to take advantage of the amazing tools available in Node.js. Java 8 is making things look very good in this respect.<p>From the point of view of the company there&#x27;s no doubting that we hope open sourcing will have a positive business impact. The toolkit does enable a very productive workflow when multiple teams are building large JavaScript apps. We built this to solve problems that we were having and that our target customers are likely to have. It&#x27;s also going to be continually maintained as both our own dev teams and those of our customers will use it.<p>The UI stuff (Presenter) has been open sourced but we&#x27;ve actually decided to go with KnockoutJS by default as it simplifies the onboarding process. As per this comment (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7429659"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7429659</a>) BRJS is much more about the toolkit supporting an application structure.",1395246882

Or might you look for the actual trademark &#x27;FLUKE&#x27;, and even buy from a reputable distributor to avoid outright counterfeits?<p>Personally I&#x27;m not a Fluke junkie, and think there&#x27;s plenty of reputable mid-range meters that will protect you just fine. However I also think that a distributor-branded direct-import is not likely to be one of these.<p>But as far as trademarks, we&#x27;re really talking about two quite <i>functional</i> colors here - a neutral-colored face for readability, and a bright shroud on the other sides for visibility. Many meters have been using these color styles for quite some time and, as your loyalty to Fluke illustrates, this does little to dilute their brand.<p>[1] Electronic design, as would be implied by the context if not for confusion induced by graphic/industrial designers thinking they have a monopoly on the term.",1395246458

From my POV it seems like people here are complaining that when they point the gun at their foot it seems to randomly go off when testing date values, and the simple answer to that would be &quot;Well, then don&#x27;t point the gun at your foot!&quot;<p>IM(not so)HO the Zen of Python operates as an excellent counterbalance to the kind of pitfalls Python can lead you to, the &quot;false midnight&quot; being a wonderful example of said pitfalls that is completely removed when following PEP 20.<p>>> &quot;Explicit is better than implicit.&quot;<p>Dates IRL cannot be false, so checking for falsiness is ambiguous. Perhaps you meant to check if it was &quot;not None&quot;. And look! The wonderful expressiveness of Python allows such a thing! `if timeobj:` is a snippet that has some heavy assumptions behind it, and if I&#x27;m reading your code this is very much <i>not</i> explicit to me what you&#x27;re trying to do.<p>>> &quot;Simple is better than complex.&quot;<p>Dealing with dates/time will always be nasty business. Let&#x27;s not add to that, and make things as simple as possible. If you are explicitly checking for midnight, perhaps a constant value set to `datetime.time(0,0,0)` would be useful for a conditional.<p>>> &quot;There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.&quot;<p>There are Pythonic ways to check for `None` and there are ways to compare date time objects. The key word for me here is &quot;obvious&quot;, since, again, the idea of a date having a boolean value is entirely foreign to the real world, and more or less a shortcut found only in computing. Don&#x27;t create an edge case that you don&#x27;t have to.<p>Now granted, the stated behavior can definitely be seen to also violate PEP 20, but simply avoiding this entire issue renders that point moot.<p>tl;dr: People complaining about unexpected results when writing bad Python code are barking up the wrong tree. Perhaps you should try a different language, or learn to code in a more Pythonic style? Both of these avenues would be much more profitable not only in the short term, but also the long term.",1395245614

Naming things the right way is important.It means you got your domain logic right.<p>&quot;component&quot; and &quot;module&quot; are vastly over used in software development so we went with something that was unique and works well with the unique concept we&#x27;d developed (~3 years old now). &quot;framework&quot; suffers the same over-use problem so we&#x27;re probably going to remove that from the intro paragraph.<p>We specifically went for &quot;Blade&quot; as it works well. Blades represent a vertical _slice_ of application functionality, from UI to interaction with a service layer. Blades contain all the assets (JS, CSS, HTML, config, images) for a single feature grouped together on disk.<p>BRJS is much more about structuring your application and enabling a workflow that ensures a large and complex JavaScript application is maintainable. It&#x27;s primarily an extensible toolkit with some core conventions e.g. scaffolding, Blades, Workbenches, Aspects, code dependency analysis for bundling for all asset types etc.<p>Right now we support writing code in a Node.js-style similar to that which Browserify enables (CommonJS + addition export support) but in the future the toolkit will allow us to move to something like ES6 or maybe TypeScript. We presently have Knockout as default in the Blade templates but we plan to add support for other template types such as Angular, Ember and Web Components (with Polymer). Until we add custom template support it&#x27;s a small manual step to use these instead of Knockout.<p>We&#x27;re only at v0.5 so many things are still evolving, including refining how we describe what it does and the benefits.<p>This is all useful feedback.

Artists are still needed for &#x27;art direction&#x27;, which is the part where he decides what general shapes and materials he wants, and basically traditionally models almost everything like houses etc. That is <i>still</i> a huge amount of work for games like Skyrim, but the end result will always be photorealistic, and it should not be the artist&#x27;s job to care about how it looks anymore.",1395245447

Perhaps the most critical. And, in many cases, your decision is a function of simple math.<p>Once you proceed past the &quot;first sign of conflict&quot;, you will quickly sink a lot of cash. You don&#x27;t get a refund if you later decide to stop, nor any other credit. That money is gone and either you keep going until you a.) win (or lose) a protracted, costly battle; b.) bankrupt your cash, energy, or will; or c.) find an opportunity to settle and stop the bleeding. By then, the damage is done.<p>So, if you decide to proceed, then you are signing up for significant cost and a ride for which you have limited control. They will keep throwing stuff at you to entangle and frustrate you. If you take the suit as far as discovery, then you can get into the high 6-figure or even 7-figure range before you know it.<p>And, before you get to discovery, the motions, counter-motions, and other pleadings can easily get you to six figures within a few short months or less (depending on the complexity of the case).<p>If you are a small business, it can be a non-starter, especially when the plaintiff is a much larger (and hostile) company. I&#x27;ve been through it personally and I decided <i>not</i> to &quot;capitulate at the first sign of conflict&quot;. I was pissed, they were wrong, I wouldn&#x27;t be bullied, etc. So, I fought it.<p>We handily beat them back on the initial injunction they were seeking. Based on the merit, we knew we&#x27;d win that easily. Still, it cost me ~$20K to actually do it. It doesn&#x27;t matter how weak their case is. They can make you bleed to prove it. The standard for having the suit labeled frivolous is extraordinarily high and you almost assuredly will not recover your legal fees.<p>We kept fighting, using some of the foundation (research, etc.) laid during the injunction battle to reduce costs. Still, by the time, we reached the mandatory (in the state of CA) settlement conference (where we decided to settle), we were out over $100K. So, that was the price of &quot;not capitulating at the first sign of conflict&quot;. Of course, we didn&#x27;t have to concede everything they initially demanded, but that small victory felt a bit Pyrrhic.<p>And, none of this cost includes the time, mental energy, and stress involved. If you are running a small business, you likely don&#x27;t have time/energy for it. So, beyond literally bankrupting you, it can damage your business (perhaps irreparably) in other ways.",1395245230

rglover,,2210,2.47727,114,593,"I like to make products with personality.<p>You can find me in Oak Park, IL, a handful of train stops from downtown Chicago. I also have a desk space in the city in Wicker Park if you&#x27;d ever like to grab a drink/chat.<p>My current project is The Meteor Chef, a site offering detailed recipes for implementing functionality in Meteor applications.<p>Previously, I built an app called Proper (using Meteor) that allowed freelancers to create, send, and get contracts signed. It wasn&#x27;t my thing (http://www.ryanglover.net/articles/proper-is-shutting-down-october-29th-2014/), ultimately, and I shut it down in the fall of 2014.<p>I&#x27;m generally available to help out with projects on a freelance/contract basis. My strong suit is design and front-end development, as well as copywriting. If you&#x27;re looking to give your product a top-notch design and experience with a bit of character, I can help.<p>Find me:\nme@ryanglover.net<p>[ my public key: https://keybase.io/glover; my proof: https://keybase.io/glover/sigs/bqk06SxPoGYU6T2-0b9HM6n7P8L-aBeYUP3YMJAXA-A ]",1297891208,1450207814

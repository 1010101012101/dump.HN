Ideally this should happen pretty quickly, but I know in the US the infrastructure just doesn&#x27;t match my current expectations. Seemingly there was zero movement until my credit account was credited the payment Friday afternoon, but the money was still in my checking account (no holds or pending transactions).<p>The weekend goes by, no movement. Monday (a bank holiday) comes and goes, as does Tuesday. I get a text message early this morning (~6:45 AM) that there was a large withdrawal from my checking account - the payment showed up! Nearly three full business days before the money was actually moved, and as of right now it&#x27;s still a pending transaction.<p>The cynic in my wants to think that it&#x27;s so people who don&#x27;t pay attention to their finances are more likely to overdraw/double-spend the money, but part of me thinks it&#x27;s just because the US infrastructure around banking and payments is so old it just isn&#x27;t capable of anything approaching real time transactions.

This has happened so many times on my Windows Mobile 10 phone, I lost count. Just this week I was looking for a better Twitter client app. I would type in &quot;twitter&quot; &quot;tweet&quot; &quot;twitter client&quot; &quot;twitter app&quot; and all I would get would be the main Twitter app and nothing else. Then I had to start doing Google searches for &quot;best twitter client for windows mobile 10&quot; which then gave me articles from 2013 and 2014 and for WP 8.1 - not exactly an up to date list of current Twitter clients.<p>Compare that to the Google Play store. You simply enter &quot;Twitter&quot; and get a dozen other apps, none of which have Twitter in their name. Plume, Echofone, Fenix, Talon, Persiscope are just a few of the examples.<p>It was such a massive headache, I actually decided yesterday I&#x27;ms scrapping Windows Mobile 10 and going back to Android. I&#x27;ve been a huge supporter since WP 7, and held out hope things would improve, and they haven&#x27;t. Their app store is a massive failure, you can&#x27;t find anything in the store you want, developers have no reason to build for the platform, and I&#x27;m not going to start with the myriad of UI problems I see already in the latest build (build 10586.63) that still have not been solved. Just basic shit like battery life is still a major problem. Not to mention they took away some very basic features from 8.1 that everybody loved like the ability to show Bing weather on the lock screen.<p>I&#x27;ve finally reached my breaking point with their platform.",1453301761

There&#x27;s a blog post we wrote when releasing it that might be helpful: <a href=""https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/15/federalist-platform-launch/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/15/federalist-platform-launch/</a> - You can find the homepage at <a href=""https://federalist.18f.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">https://federalist.18f.gov</a>, but the majority of the application is behind authentication so that might be only so useful.<p>For background, Federalist is tooling wrapped around Jekyll, AWS and Github so that it feels like a CMS but you are actually editing a static site. In building many Jekyll sites for our partner agencies (and for ourself as the 18F site is a Jekyll site) we found that the process of using and maintaining a Jekyll site was very technical and required a great deal of context. So we built Federalist to reduce the friction of using static sites.<p>It automates the following:\n* Setting up webhooks on the Github repository to be notified of any changes\n* Building the site when it receives notifications of a change and then pushing the site to an S3 bucket<p>On top of that it provides an editing interface for non-technical folks to keep content up to date.<p>As always, its about tradeoffs and if the WordPress API route is working well for you, I think that&#x27;s a good one and I&#x27;ve personally heard a lot of great things about the new API and consuming it with a smaller JS app/front end. Personally, I prefer to work with static sites so that I don&#x27;t have to concern myself with database availability or stability as a single point of failure for the site.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for more information, I invite you to join our public slack at <a href=""https://chat.18f.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chat.18f.gov</a> and entering the &quot;federalist-public&quot; room.

As smoking has become more costly (with anti-secondhand-smoke regulations) and socially unacceptable, many smokers have found means to quit, and surely many used vaping for this. But it seems to me that a large proportion of the people who took up vaping were hardcore smokers who want a more licit habit. And so they&#x27;re frequently going on about how vaping is totally harmless, it has absolutely no secondhand consumption issue (all very dubious). If vapers were formerly the most hardcore smokers, it&#x27;s not surprising that vapers would be less likely to quit. Although it is still probably a good thing, from a harm reduction viewpoint.<p>Vaping for smoking cessation needs more than some anecdata. It needs controlled trials where vaping is compared against placebos and other cessation methods, like Chantix. but I&#x27;m afraid that the vaping industry is nearly as interested in promoting disinformation as the tobacco industry was.",1453300267

Avoiding those directories (and other stuff that was traditionally located directly in $HOME) was probably why the more recent &quot;desktop environments&quot; used $HOME/Desktop as their &quot;top&quot; directory for the GUI environment.<p>Later on, some people felt that all the configuration files in the home directory ($HOME/.<i>rc and similar) was a mess, so the $HOME/.config was proposed as the &quot;proper&quot; location for configuration files. Of course, this just resulted in programs using </i>both* directories, depending on when they were written.<p>Years later, in their usual over-engineered style, the freedesktop.org people later extended this idea into the XDG Base Directory Specification[1], which is where $HOME/.local enters the story. Of course, they <i>don&#x27;t</i> actually specify it as a prefix suitable for use in &quot;./configure --prefix=&quot; (which would have made a lot more sense). The only define the share directory for use with XDG_DATA_HOME:<p><pre><code>    $XDG_DATA_HOME defines the base directory relative to which user specific\n    data files should be stored. If $XDG_DATA_HOME is either not set or empty,\n    a default equal to $HOME/.local/share should be used. \n</code></pre>\nOf course, now you have to lookup the relevant environment variable and specify all the detailed directory options to autoconf if you want to actually support their spec, which probably looks something like<p><pre><code>    # pick one\n    PREFIX=$HOME\n    #PREFIX=$HOME/.local\n\n    ./configure --prefix=&quot;${PREFIX}&quot; \\n        --sysconfdir=&quot;${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:${HOME}/.config}&quot; \\n        --localstatedir=&quot;${XDG_CACHE_HOME}:${HOME}/.cache}&quot; \\n        --datarootdir=&quot;${XDG_DATA_HOME}:${HOME}/.local/share}&quot;\n</code></pre>\nXDG isn&#x27;t a bad idea, but it&#x27;s poorly specified and as that example shows, it can conflict with convention at times.<p>None of that makes $HOME/.local (or any other prefix) <i>wrong</i> - it&#x27;s your homedir, you can organize it as you like. That&#x27;s one of the nice features I really like about autoconf - it makes it very easy to install software anywhere you want, even unusual/non-standard locations.<p>[1] <a href=""http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-l...</a>",1453299857

The default choices with meteor are pretty fixed<p>This is exactly the reason I&#x27;m not using meteor - and it&#x27;s not so much wanting the ability to <i>switch</i> backends as knowing in advance I want to use an SQL database like Postgres, and not Mongo. With meteor, it&#x27;s Mongo or nothing.<p>I believe SQL integration is on their roadmap, but I think now it&#x27;s too late.<p>You can in fact use React as the view layer with meteor, so for an app using React, the remaining killer feature of meteor 6 months ago was optimistic updates, with database sync all handled. But, there was still the hard limitation that you must use it with Mongo, which simply made it a no go. I commented about this here, a couple of times, and others did too. I even asked a few months ago if there was a library that just provided the optimistic updates feature. Well, now there is one that looks promising, though it&#x27;s still early days and I&#x27;ve not used it yet - Facebook&#x27;s Relay - with complete React integration, caching, request management and optimisation, and yes, optimistic updates and sync. The difference though, is that it talks to a graphql server, which can be written over any database at all - with Relay the frontend is entirely agnostic about the database used, by design, because it talks to it through a middle tier. There&#x27;s no reason for me to wait for meteor to implement SQL integration any more, because now another solution has come along.<p>I still don&#x27;t understand why meteor made the choice of a hard dependency on Mongo if they ever wanted to become mainstream. Had they not, it&#x27;s very likely that many developers, myself included, would have picked up meteor over the past year and would be hooked on it. Now though, that train is rapidly leaving the station, at least for devs on the React stack. I think they missed their window.",1453299389

When I was in high school we watched some video about the future highlighting self piloting cars and how they could drive bumper to bumper. That doesn&#x27;t make any sense though, you need to leave space for lateral movements.<p>The problem as I see it is that most people think about driving as competitive. They don&#x27;t want <i>you</i> to get in front of <i>them</i>. This is odd, because someone who is passing one person will often carry on passing and be out of sight in a minute.<p>This is where the idea of driving collaboratively comes in. If you let someone merge, make their exit, pass you, you&#x27;re enabling flow.<p>Instead, people drive competitively. They get as close as possible to someone&#x27;s bumper during a merge to ensure that only one (or potentially zero) cars get in front of them. This forces people to stop or slow considerably before someone can get in front of them. The same with passing, if someone is blocking the fast lane, the passing car needs to slow considerably (affecting cars behind them) and change lanes (affecting cars in another lane). Everyone thinks it&#x27;s about them, and some will even speed up when you try to pass as if you are insulting the speed that they are driving. It&#x27;s madness.<p>If I ever have a ton of money I&#x27;m going to take out a national ad campaign encouraging people to drive collaboratively.",1453298968

I was a smoker for a decade and I quit smoking last year only because of vapes (e-cigs).<p>Didn&#x27;t even plan to quit smoking but I was concerned about my health so I decided to try vapes for a while. The cool thing about it is that you can control your nicotine dose, so every month I lowered it a bit. The difference was small enough that my body didn&#x27;t feel it.<p>After a couple of months I got to 0-nicotine vape. Did that for a month and by that point my body was not addicted to it any more. Then I just stopped vaping altogether. Not because I wanted to but because my body didn&#x27;t need it anymore and I couldn&#x27;t care less about it.<p>The whole process was pretty easy. At no point did I struggle to quit. I just did what my body felt like. I&#x27;m pretty sure the story would have been totally different without e-cigs.",1453298624

He didn&#x27;t give up the e-cigarette until it finally quit working about three years ago.<p>I don&#x27;t think using the disposable ones with the fixed nicotine content would have allowed him to quit.

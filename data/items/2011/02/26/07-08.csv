This is toxic thinking for a technical entrepreneur, to assume that any use case outside your original design is either pathological or caused by user error.<p>Smart developers crave this kind of feedback, so that they can figure out where their assumptions about user behavior are wrong and work to correct them.",1298707114

2265125,comment,2264258,2264971,0,0,T-R,,,"True, but the hardware still needs to scale linearly with the number of concurrent connections, and it leaves them pretty susceptible to high traffic related problems, like at peak times when games are first released. What if someone decides to launch a DDoS? Virtualization also limits the type of games they can run - you can't run a dozen PS3 games without a dozen PS3s.<p>On top of that, they shoulder the cost of upgrading the hardware, along with the risk - another Dreamcast (high initial sales followed by a severe dropoff) would be disastrous. I'm not sure how they can pass those costs on to their customers at a price point that's attractive to anyone who doesn't play <i>lots</i> of games per month (also making it possibly a net loss), or that's competitive with the more scalable, more performant, and lower risk model of running the games on the client, whether it's a console or a PC.",1298707058

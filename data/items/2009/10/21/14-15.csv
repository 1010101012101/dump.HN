The idea behind HMOs was that these insurers would control costs by offering a wide array of preventive care to their subscribers.

An insurer that invested in preventive care was unlikely to reap the cost-saving benefits.""<p>That's an interesting response to the HMO phenomenon, which I remember was touted as a solution to ballooning health care costs.

I can't imagine what I would do if I opened the source file from a team in Ireland and found that it was all in Gaelic. Perhaps it's inconvenient for them that they have to read it in English, but at least it's a single language, not several.<p>Now, one thing I can imagine working would this being supported in an IDE, or at a 'meta symbolic' (for lack of a better term) level.<p>For example, if we simply implemented a strict transliteration system, so that there was a one-to-one correspondence between a program written in English and the same one written in Chinese, then an editor could convert between them on the fly. This would be useful for switching between alphabets and making code easier to read for different people but doesn't necessarily carry meaning through. (The English word ""while,"" spelled with Chinese characters is still the English word ""while."")<p>Working with an IDE that maintains a one-to-one mapping internally between English keywords in a given language and their non-English equivalents, one could conceivably code in Russian and have the IDE internally translate it to English before passing the code to the compiler or interpreter, a sort of pre-compilation stage if you will. It could work in reverse as well, so that the canonical version is always in English (or whatever the native language of the programming language is) but coders in different nationalities see their own language.<p>With languages that use symbols, like Lisp, one could create a many-to-one mapping such that a single symbol has multiple printed representations depending on the (human) language in use. This would have to be enabled with a reader level switch. In Common Lisp, you could do something similar to this by creating a package for the language of your choice which maps symbols to their standard equivalents.<p>Non of these solutions are perfect however. For example, non handle languages designed to imitate English grammar such as SQL, for example. And they introduce complexity that may be unnecessary.<p>Edit: Changed India to Ireland; apparently Indians speak English.",1256134886

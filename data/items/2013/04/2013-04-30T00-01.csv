You simply have to ALLEGE that the other party did something wrong via a lawsuit and then it's up to the courts to sort it out.<p>Intimidation lawsuits are easy to make happen as the cost of prosecution for a large company is small, where as the cost of defense for an individual is large.

I thought it was possible,to start a hydro generator by ""self-excitation"".  When a generator stops, there is typically a small residual permanent magnetic field left, due to hysteresis.  This small field may be used to ""bootstrap"" the generator, whereby on initial spin up a small current is generated, which may then be fed back to the field coil, further exciting the generator's field and increasing the output, until full capacity is reached.<p>All that is then required is a method of opening the penstock, which can presumably be hand cranked?",1367283106

Microsoft are currently associated with the whole flat-design UI trend and I can only speculate that changing to a completely flat look would only fuel the speculation that Apple are out of ideas and lack vision to keep innovating thus driving their share price down further and undoing all of their hard work over the years. You're only as good as your last hit as they say in the music industry.<p>I am envisioning if Apple does change to a flat UI look, it'll have their own little twist on it. I think it's a given they'll drop the skeuomorphism from iOS, because lets face it, skeuomorphic elements like leather books and note paper backgrounds look dated when used anywhere (not just mobile applications). I would expect things will get flatter, but evident by their latest Mac OS and iTunes redesigns which I think give us a sneak peek of the direction: not completely flat, still dabs of light & aluminium as well as rounded corners on things.
Whatever the end result is, I think we can all agree Apple needs to evolve. The iOS interface has remained basically untouched since 2007, it's time for a change because the aging operating system is starting to show its age.",1367283066

This means that a 1000MW plant has 3000MW of thermal energy to manage at full load and 2000MW of energy to dissipate safely. The systems to do this take a great deal of power to run, so can't be bootstrapped off of batteries.<p>Also interesting is that power prices will occasionally go negative in cases where there's a 'surplus' of generation. What's happening in these cases is that generation owners are making the judgement that its more cost effective to pay people to take their power than it is to shut off their plant. Shutting down a big plant is an event, and it takes a while to get them back running. Sometimes, shutting them down doesn't make sense.",1367282669

Decentralizing this is seen as dangerous because it would jeopardize the provisioning of services that are expected to be available equally to everyone. To the extent that municipal taxes exist, they tend to be very low and tied to specific limited services under local control.<p>When Thatcher introduced the Poll Tax in the UK, which is what eventually morphed into the current Council Tax - the UK's version of municipal tax rates - it was a shocking development that even contributed to rioting (though to be fair, in part because the way it was created also explicitly disenfranchised the homeless).

5629783,comment,5627693,5627693,5,0,eksith,,,"Well, this discussion is quickly moving toward the shortcomings of Wikipedia.<p>There's plenty of opinion of the deletion-happy (if that's the operative term) policy of the admins, especially as it pertains to notability, and I think this is a common complaint : 
<a href=""http://www.highprogrammer.com/alan/rants/wikipedia-delete.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.highprogrammer.com/alan/rants/wikipedia-delete.ht...</a><p>I do something that may seem like trying to fix a leaky dam with chewing gum, but every time I see an article nominated for deletion, I copy the source to a private wiki I'm running. Sometimes, the deletion nomination goes away, other times it does get deleted, but at least then, I have a copy.<p>But we also have to keep in mind that there are plenty of other resources on the web specifically aimed at niche resources. E.G. Wikia. I've lost count of how many comic book related articles were deleted only to show up on the DC or Marvel wikis. ( <a href=""http://dc.wikia.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dc.wikia.com/</a>  <a href=""http://marvel.wikia.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marvel.wikia.com/</a> )<p>Likewise, it's not unreasonable that a lot of content gets missed by the editors, since it's a big place and most editors have one or two areas that they focus on. As the editing guidelines state, when in doubt engage in dispute resolution, not edit wars. If you can make a good case for why an article <i>should</i> be there in the first place, be persuasive in the talk pages.<p>So a few pointers for people getting angry at Wikipedia:<p>First, ask whether the article is a good fit for the wiki. Can it go on a blog or a niche wiki (like a dedicated Wikia) instead? The Pokmon example is a bit extreme, but I think many of those pages may get deleted or merged. There's always the Pokmon Wikia : <a href=""http://pokemon.wikia.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pokemon.wikia.com</a><p>Second, notability is a very tricky thing. Reputable sources may be even trickier. Rather than debating notability, focus on reputable sources (since that's the biggest hiccup for references). If you can link NY Times articles or BBC or some other news source, rather than just community sites, other blogs (depending on popularity) etc... you'll have a better chance of getting the article/section through and staying there.<p>Third, well written articles have a better chance of surviving than those that give off the 2-3 paragraph stub vibe. The more reputable citations and best content structure you can give, the better the chances an article survives (this may partly explain the Pokmon pages too). If you have trivia, try to merge it into the content body more, rather than list at the end; that feels tacked on and superfluous, if not directly supporting the main content.<p>Fourth, try to be a bit more empathetic to the goals of the Wiki while being objective to the subject when asserting your views (especially on controversial articles). How you word things is a big hint as to whether that content will remain or get scrubbed the next day/hour/minute.<p>Now, I hope can go back to discussing Wikidata and how Wikipedia and everyone else will benefit.",1367282229

5629701,comment,5629255,5629659,28,0,DannyBee,,,"What do you mean ""allow him""?<p>Lawyers do not make decisions (or at least, should not).
We exist to assess risk, analyze liabilities, advise clients, and hopefully, present options and strategies to minimize risk while still accomplishing a given goal.<p>Any smart lawyer in this case knows part of him still being hirable is going to be not having his entire reputation destroyed. Depending on the accusations, ""say nothing"" may not be a necessary or even valid strategy.
Additionally, the client is the one paying. If they strongly feel they want to defend themselves, your job as a lawyer is to try to make sure it does not legally jeopardize their case (or warn them if it will and they want to do it anyway).<p>In any case, note that civil cases in most countries are strongly pushed to settlements. This is one of the reasons for broad discovery in most places.<p>All of this said, lawsuits against employees like this are pretty darn rare.  Having been involved in a number of these situations on the other side, usually they are just bluster, basically a warning that ""if he works on something competitive, we will come after you"", or a warning shot to stop poaching.
An actual lawsuit is usually reserved for exec and above, which i don't think he was (Sorry if i'm misunderstanding the level/ladder distinctions Opera uses :P)<p>Lawsuits like this tend to only result when someone has <i>really</i> pissed someone else off, or plans on doing something one side sees as <i>really</i> damaging.<p>Again, the above is my experience in the US, Norway may be different.<p>Outside of the actual legal realm, there is always a hearts and minds war.  People stop paying attention to this stuff very quickly.  Whatever gets said in the first few days will be the narrative for a long time.
After the first few hacker news posts, this will go away for a year or two, and then someone will win or lose.
In the meantime, if he doesn't speak, everyone will think of him as ""that guy that stole stuff from Opera"".
On the other hand, if he frames the narrative right, it becomes ""Opera, that company that is going down the tubes because it has resorted to suing former consultants on baseless charges"".<p>Since nobody really wants to go to court, or lose mindshare (In this case, it's very valuable to both sides for very different reasons), whoever frames the narrative best tends to extract the most favorable settlement terms, or at least, go into the suit with a better stance and ability to press  claims harder.<p>In an actual trial of course, it won't make a lick of difference.",1367280963

A good web designer will be able to apply their design skills to the site.  They'll work with me, and I'll make sure that the system is generating whatever content they need to style.  It's the best way of ensuring that the end result matches the designer's vision.<p>If that's not an option,<p>2) Ask the designer to provide all of the individual images that they used to create the mockup, along with relevant CSS and HTML.  Some designers can't apply their design ideas to dynamic websites yet, but can create a static page of their design.  We take that as a guide, break it apart, and then put it back together bit by bit in such a way that it works with the dynamic system.  This is, of course, less efficient.<p>And if that's not an option,<p>3) Curse and waste time slicing apart the mockup to try to extract the same images that the designer pasted together to create the mockup.  Then do all the work of converting the mockup to a web design and applying the design ourselves.  This is least efficient and has the greatest chance of being not quite what the designer intended due to the increased likelihood of miscommunication, having programmers doing design work, and because the designer often knew nothing about the underlying system that they were designing for (otherwise we'd probably be in one of the previous cases).<p>Also, as mentioned by hnruss, we discover the implied functionality, find out the requirements, and build code to support it.  Then we add in all the missing pieces that typically get left out of mockups, such as error messages, or content that only shows for users with certain roles or in certain conditions.

Most nuclear power plants generate electricity by having that heat turn water into steam, which is then used to power steam turbines that actually drive the generator coils. Of course, in order to do this, you have to be able to pump water into the reactor to be turned into steam, and that pumping requires power. So yes, while you definitely need power for the safety/management equipment, the major bootstrap issue is almost certainly all of the power necessary for the pumps.",1367280215

It did.<p>I was looking for a job change, and I used this chance to add that failure to my resume. It is a part of my history, whether or not I personally felt that it was a failure. Surprisingly, the instant I sent out my new resume to companies (I previously left it out due to shame), I was invited for interviews with MUCH greater success, and got a few decent offers. Of course, the companies I applied to were different from the ones previously, so I cannot say for sure that putting the startup had a better result, but it seems to be true.<p>Even during interviews, employees at these companies seemed to light up when discussing my experience with my failed startup.

In most of Europe, most tax money flows to the national governments, and large parts of the municipal spending then flows back out from the national government earmarked for specific areas, such as education.<p>In many cases municipal governments have <i>no</i> power to alter tax rates, or are bound to a very limited range.<p>In many countries most tax revenue also comes from VAT, rather than income taxes, and highly progressive taxation is a large part of the discussion of income taxes. Just the idea of having a single setting for tax rate itself in the original was/is something you would occasionally find advocated from far right parties, but never the European mainstream.<p>You would also tend to see larger infrastructure projects funded by regional or national governments, rather than coming out of municipal tax revenue.<p>Of course a lot of this would complicate game mechanics, and so it might be considered ""just"" a simplification, but it creates a model that from a European perspective is bizarre.",1367280137

2691165,comment,2688614,2690267,2,0,tzs,,,"Something doesn't make sense in that blog entry you cite. He says:<p><pre><code>   Now lets re-explain rainbow tables:

   1. take a dictionary - say, of all combinations of alphanumerics
   less than 15 characters

   2. hash all of them

   3. burn the results onto a DVD.

   You now have several hundred billion hash values that you
   can reverse back to text - a rainbow table.
</code></pre>
Alphanumeric usually means either 36 or 62 possible characters. Let's take 36. Then there are 36^14 possible 14 character alphanumeric passwords. (He said less than 15, so we should also consider 13 characters, 12 characters, and so on, so this is going to come out a little low since I'm just doing 14 exactly). That's 6.14 x 10^21 possible passwords.<p>If you could compute 10 billion hashes/second, that would take 20000 years. (41 million years if mixed case alphanumeric is allowed). Could anyone REALLY make a table covering all 14 character or less alphanumerics in 2007, and fit it on DVD?<p>I believe there were tables for 14 character Windows passwords then, but due to poor design Windows passwords were in effect treated as two 7 character passwords. You just needed tables that covered the hashes of all 7 character passwords, which is a lot more tractable. Could that be what the author was thinking of?",1308894239

2691112,comment,2687885,2690957,2,0,Silhouette,,,"FWIW, I've spent a substantial chunk of my career working with C++, including on heavily mathematical code where C++'s performance did make it a suitable tool for the job. That taught me that advocates of other languages sometimes exaggerate their performance claims.<p>It also taught me that most software that ""needs to be written in C++ for performance reasons"" really doesn't. Most of the old arguments against VM-based languages, so-called scripting languages, and functional languages have been out of date for years now as technologies like JIT compilation have matured. As the coming generations of processors introduce more parallel processing power but don't speed up sequential execution much more, languages that provide a natural model for expressing parallel algorithms or for auto-parallelisation behind the scenes will become even more advantageous.<p>You mentioned some of the aerospace projects but you automatically said that it wasn't realistic to expect similar quality from ""normal software"". That is the mindset that I think needs to change in our industry. For example, every study I've ever read about Cleanroom Software Engineering has shown that its up-front development costs (both time and money) are typically within a factor of 2 or 3 of a ""normal"" software development process (often much closer) and while it doesn't completely eliminate bugs you do consistently see bug rates at least an order of magnitude lower for Cleanroom jobs. Over the lifetime of most projects, the total development+bug fixing time is certainly in the same ballpark at that point. There is no evidence that such code is any less maintainable in the face of changing requirements than code developed using any other process (on the contrary, the systematic and carefully documented structure gives you a great start) and the morale of the development team is usually noticeably higher (because they are spending most of their time building interesting stuff instead of fixing bugs that should never have been there).<p>Elsewhere, there is telecoms control software in the world, written in Erlang, that has been operating continuously for years with a few seconds of downtime in total since it went live. That's some absurd number of 9s of reliability, because the software architecture is fundamentally designed to be fault tolerant.<p>I guess I'm just trying to say that we shouldn't assume today's routine commercial practice is the most efficient, reliable way of doing things. We know, beyond any reasonable doubt, that it isn't. As an industry, we allow ourselves to be held back by non-technical issues like the availability of ready-trained staff, because development groups are too tight to provide training to improve their people's skills, and by preconceptions that say languages or development processes or software design principles that aren't today's mainstream must be too hard for everyday development tasks outside of niches where quality really matters.<p>I'd have a lot more sympathy for development groups that struggle to maintain shipping code in the face of evolving security threats and the like if those groups didn't shoot themselves in the foot, stick a noose around their necks and then tie their hands behind their back before they kicked the stool away.",1308892852

Their age, interests, location, education, etc. You can bid on them there and appeal to their situation, needs and interests directly. If you are selling XYZ service for race car drivers, you can appeal to people that love racing cars with an article and lead form telling them how XYZ service is highly essential for their profession.<p>Different approaches but still profitable. We spend about 40% of our monthly budget on search and 60% on Facebook. FB is very good when trying to generate leads that you eventually turn into sales.

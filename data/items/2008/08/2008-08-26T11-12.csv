Below is what I can recall off the top of my head.<p>The blogs in particular may hold useful info for you regarding getting visas and working in the U.S. plus the journey in startup as a whole - I particularly like <a href=""http://www.kulveer.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kulveer.co.uk</a> and <a href=""http://blog.harjtaggar.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.harjtaggar.com</a> who are the <a href=""http://www.auctomatic.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.auctomatic.com</a> guys as they give a good level of detail throughout their journey.<p>However, <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/02/coming-to-america-getting-visas-to-do-business-in-silicon-valley/#more-17036"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/02/coming-to-america-getti...</a> (or <a href=""http://is.gd/1Vrf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://is.gd/1Vrf</a> in short) by Peter from ClickPass could be what you were referring to and probably holds most of the answers you want in the most succinct form.<p>Anyway, I'm sure if you contact them they may be answer specific visa questions from their experience. Hope this helps.<p>---<p><pre><code>  http://www.auctomatic.com

It is also fraught with additional risks, as Facebook can pull the plug on your business and destroy you in the blink of an eye (see Scrabulous), whereas that would be much harder off the FB platform.",1219751468
286969,comment,286957,286957,0,0,wyclif,,,"Sorry, but I stopped reading when I reached this paragraph:<p><i>The good news from the Shelfari deal is that when startups get acquired, they tend to stagnate. This is how Del.icio.us went from a truly innovative startup to a company that spent two years readying their second release.</i><p>Bad, bad example, and one that makes me doubt the analytical powers of the LT honcho.  The reader is supposed to believe that Delicious has either been standing still for 2 years, or that v.2 was a waste of Joshua Schachter's immense efforts to improve it.  And there is no doubt that Delicious has climbed a slow curve, but the worst thing about this piece is that if this guy had ever used it he <i>might</i> have picked up the subtleties and functionality of Delicious that aren't so obvious to the casual user.<p>He would have been better off using, say, Jaiku as an illustration of what happens when a company lets a project die of attrition.",1219751288

Our mission in life can be measured in four ways: To Live, To Love, To Learn, and To Leave a Legacy.<p>It's good to grow outside the programming box. I've found such growth, even when not directly aligned with corporate goals, always helps the larger organization anyway. This is something that is deeply counter-intuitive, so many organizations drop the ball in this respect.<p>I remember consulting with a dynamic, fast-growing software consulting company out of Austin, Texas, many years ago. They had went from 8 to 800 employees in something like six years. As part of that, they were having all sorts of conversations and problems between having small-company roots and big company problems.<p>As part of that, I was talking to one of the full-time managers about how they measure employee performance. I'll never forget what she said. She said that they used to just have the employee each quarter figure out some personal goal and go achieve it. ""We can't continue doing that,"" she told me, ""because so many people pick goals that are not aligned with our corporate goals.""<p>I left the office thinking that I just heard how that company was planning to stop growing.",1219749953

  * Is there some constraint, some condition, some fold we can do to find a new medicine or something?

A basic introduction to computational biology and relevant algorithms would be very appreciated.<p>I found this(genetic programming for protein folding):

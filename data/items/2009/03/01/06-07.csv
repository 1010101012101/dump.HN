498828,comment,496946,497151,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"There's one more thing I forgot to mention...<p>The data I'm having the user order is not only order-specific, but is recursive.  That is, one of the items on the list, rather than be a letter like ""B"" can be a list in and of itself.  It's basically like ""files and folders""<p>A major problem isn't only the UI, which took me days to make (drag and drop for files/folders ... anybody seen anything like this done before in HTML+JS?), but mostly is in the updating/validation.  I receive information, like ""moved item:  /path/to/item to before /some/other/path"" and I now need to make sure this is a valid action (eg: can't put a folder into one of its own subfolders, can't put a file in a file, etc), and also update the database to reflect this.<p>I chose to use JSON to encode objects in the DB, then decode them into an array, and do some easy/fast array stuff to perform the action they requested.  Just judging on the array code, which does several ""isset()"" calls and splices, I'd imagine doing this with a DB would be a major heartache... but I have no doubt you'd be able to come up with some brilliant way to do it.<p>To each their own :)",1235890217
498827,comment,498283,498522,0,0,thwarted,,,"Yes, I was able to determine that bcrypt is a one-way hash algorithm.  But part of my point is that the name is ambiguous because there are multiple things using that name. Even the wikipedia entry for bcrypt is for the encryption software ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt</a> ), not the hashing algorithm, so I was having a hard time finding out more about the algorithm other than that there is a ruby binding for it.  Thankfully, the ruby docs contain references.<p>Consider this codinghorror posting, <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000953.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000953.html</a> , where Atwood confuses the reasons why third-party websites would need to obscure passwords in the first paragraph and quoted section (a third party needs the plaintext of the password in order to offer integration services (assuming things like remote keys and oauth are not provided), so storing a hash of the password is meaningless in that context).<p>And I only used twitter and twitter applications as an example of a ecosystem that has, up until their oauth deployment, multiple consumers of passwords for different purposes (twitter for authentication, apps for integration), as a way to point out the confusion.",1235890113

498824,comment,497951,498707,0,0,trevelyan,,,"I'm not sure what the n = 1  Google argument is supposed to accomplish - is boo.com relevant too?  These are single data points in an argument about aggregate investment quality and the only meaningful statistic is aggregate ROI now. I think it's interesting you're jumping back to the late 90s again, because if you had a stronger argument vis-a-vis the quality of VC investment over the last few years, I really don't think you'd need to go there.<p>You could be absolutely right. There could be a lot of fantastic companies just sitting in VC portfolios making profits and waiting for the market to turn in order to maximize their exits. That is true. But it's also true that owning profitable companies does not generally incite the sort of liquidity crisis that seems prevalent in the industry right now.<p>I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm just saying there's very little evidence that the people you're proposing get a massive windfall in the form of a $30 million turn at the roulette table know what they're doing. And some of what they're doing hurts people who are competent and profitable. So in my industry, I don't think the word incompetent is really that strong. They could be making money, they're not. YMMV.",1235889325

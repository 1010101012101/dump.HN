In practice you could collect this information over time yourself.<p>The difference to what /news does would be that submissions with little points would not show in the results even briefly, and submissions with a lot of points wouldn't fall off even if you're away for a long time.\n",1191192656

61401,comment,60960,61074,0,0,tuukkah,,,"Indeed, I wasn't considering such implementation issues as the link limit of 180. Collecting links from some of the /news pages should be a good approximation. For longer times away, the collected links could be stored periodically and upon return sorted by points, descending.\n",1191192075

More typical computer users just buy new systems when they become unusably slow after a couple years, which is good for Dell and the like.<p>What gets me to stay is tablet PC support and font rendering. Linux doesn't have an application that comes close to Microsoft OneNote for note taking. I wish that Apple made a touch screen Mac and I will probably switch when they launch one.<p>The font rendering on Windows blows away Linux and Mac, in my opinion. There is nothing so crisp as Windows standard font smoothing (not ClearType). Linux and Mac look incredibly ugly without subpixel font smoothing or other heavy anti-aliasing. I spent a while trying to figure out how to get Linux to render fonts better and gave up when it required a kernel recompile.<p>Has anyone here gotten Linux to render fonts well without subpixel anti-aliasing?",1191191353

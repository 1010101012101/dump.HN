You get a ""lost generation"" of businesses which could have used capital more profitably than the ones who did get funded.<p>Like anyone else who shirks their job,  capitalists who participate in bubbles ultimately won't get paid for the labor that they're not doing.<p>Worse than that,  it's quite possible that more financial capital exists than there is actual demand for investment.  In that case,  capital should be rerouted towards taxes or higher wages for workers:  perhaps we'd be better off with a lower national debt and if Joe Sixpack is better paid,  businesses can compete to offer him new and better products and services,  creating new opportunities for businesses to succeed and wealth to ""trickle up"".",1301061596

If you're mauled by a dog, you will understandably be afraid of dogs afterwards. Probably excessively, irrationally so. If you live through a depression, you may become obsessive about saving. If you have a great time polka dancing, you may scoff at electric guitars.<p>Eventually these things build up to the point where you're a curmudgeon. We say old people are ""stuck in their ways."" But young people, for all their foolishness, see their parents viewpoints and habits and virtues and prejudices, not with objective eyes - they have their own faults too - but with fresher ones.<p>If humanity ever consists mostly of people with thousands of years of life experience, accumulated habits, etc - well, that sounds like a pretty miserable existence to me.

Retweet them from your personal twitter account and it will at least hit your followers.  Don't feel ashamed of asking a few friends to also retweet to their followers.  The effect might be small, but it's a minimal effort.<p>2) Focusing on one app is a bad idea.  It's like having a stock portfolio of 1 company.  Make several games, even if they're smaller and less polished.  You might see that one is more successful and can then concentrate on making it more polished.<p>3) Most important: do what you love.  Don't make your platform, language, or design decisions based on what your google analytics says will make you a few bucks more.

Indeed, on his blog Taubes himself has identified areas where he has a hunch about mechanisms but admits we simply won't know until better research is done.<p>Throughout this discussion you've made vague assertions about how scientists disagree with Taubes, but never cited specific points where got he facts wrong, only that some scientists don't like his using their data and words to support a conclusion they don't share. You made the bizarre claim that Americans have been eating more fat and that the Atkins diet is a disaster, both without any supporting evidence. I find this unpersuasive.<p>If the Atkins diet is such a disaster, for example, why is that when some of your ""real scientists"" conducted the relatively famous ATOZ diet study[1], it showed that the Atkins diet provided roughly twice the weight loss of the Zone, LEARN, and Ornish diets while providing as good or better secondary benefits (e.g. heart disease indicators). I mean, does that sound like ""a disaster"" to you?<p>Taubes is hardly alone in crying ""foul"" over the low-fat, high-carb diet fiasco. Watch Robert Lustig's UCSF talk entitled ""Sugar: The Bitter Truth""[2] He'll go into plenty of detail on the biochemistry involved. He starts out, however, by saying his goal is to debunk the last 30 years of nutrition information in America, and I think he makes a damn good case.<p>The money slide for our discussion appears at 0:09:40 in the talk. It shows, as I alluded to earlier, that the percentage of calories from fat in US adult diets has been steadily declining since the mid-1960s. From the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s, the percentage of prevalence of obesity is pretty stable, maybe ticking up a percent or so. But in 1982 the AHA, AMA, and USDA tell us we should cut our fat intake. Faced with low-fat processed foods that taste like cardboard, the manufacturers try to improve the taste with things like high-fructose corn syrup and guess what happens? In the mid-1980s the incidence of obesity shows a sudden, dramatic increase, doubling from 15% to 30% over the next two decades. Yes, there was a disaster all right, but it had nothing to do with increased fat intake or the Atkins diet.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17341711"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17341711</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM</a>",1301059784

And someone who is interested in the ipad will probably be interested in stories about the ipad2, even though he may not have explicitly looked for ipad2 tags but only for ipad tags.<p>Since ""ipad"" is actually a substring of ""ipad2"", this could be easily solved with a simple substring search in the tag.<p>A more problematic example is someone missing a story tagged ""java"" but not ""programming"" when searching for stories tagged ""programming"".<p>The solution to this problem is to have a tag hierarchy.  Thus, the ""java"" tag would be explicitly made a subtag of the ""programming"" tag.  Unfortunately, the problem with this solution is that it's not easily automatable (though I'm sure there's been a lot of research done in this area), so the hierarchy would probably have to be built by hand.  And this, in turn, means that it probably won't be done for a lot of tags.<p>Perhaps a good compromise would be to require each story to be tagged with at least one predefined tag (from a wide selection of predefined tags that are already organized in to a tag hierarchy), and allow an arbitrary number of user-defined tags.<p>That way there'll be at least some minimal organization to the submitted stories.",1301059125

What with PATRIOT acts, FBI wiretaps and ACTAs, no one can claim that any data in the US is safe from government eavesdropping. This is certainly more true in the US than in Europe. Then again, for all I know European governments might just be better at hiding.<p>Hence, there can not be any data security in the cloud. However, Europe mandates that every company must delete your data if you ask them to.

I'm not really that interested in whether Android is open source or not.<p>What I am interested in is whether the device lets me do what <i>I</i> want - that is, it allows me to download and install whatever software I choose to, in what manner I want. Android lets me do this. That is why Android is 'Open'.<p>Whilst I understand for most consumers this is not an issue, and I have no qualms with people who go along with that, for me personally as a programmer, I will not buy any other smartphone platform if it does not afford me that same liberty.",1301058532

I own an Android phone and have been happy with it, but I'm not interested in giving up my freedom just to have my hands on the latest toy. I am extremely disappointed in this decision. I wasn't under any particular illusions about Google, but I actually believed they were comitted to Android as an open source project. If they get their act together and get their source code out the door soon and don't repeat this nonsense for subsequent Android releases, they will keep me as a customer of devices based on their operating system.

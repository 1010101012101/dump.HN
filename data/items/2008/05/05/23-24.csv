Not 30 second clips of a dog on a skateboard, or the millionth person to mime the Numa song, but classic clips and full length programs, with a focus on documentaries and non fiction. Smashing Television, not Gimmick Television.""",1210031905
182013,comment,181697,181699,0,0,icey,,,"Quick Disclaimer, I work tangentially in the health insurance industry. That being said, I know what variables factor in to a rate:<p>1. Deductible<p>2. Age<p>3. Whether or not you use tobacco - This includes chew.<p>4. Your gender makes a difference.<p>5. Occasionally, your BMI makes a difference. But most often, it's age + tobacco use that makes the largest difference.<p>Insurance rates will also change by your location. Say you had a twin who lived 1 city over; you may get different rates depending on your location.<p>Occasionally, a rate quote will be different due to the time of year that you're asking for your effective date. That seems to differ between carriers, and not a lot of carriers do this type of discounting or loading.<p>Hope that helps.",1210031778

We used to buy hardware from one of these mom & pop shops (don't ask) because they would get deals that were basically next to nothing compared to the dell's and NCIX's of the world.<p>I used to feel bad for the retailer though.. he was making stupid margins like a dollar on an $80 HDD, and $30 on a complete PC. I'm not sure how he managed to stay in business, but man, there must have been a few stressful nights coming home to his family every month.<p>Run away from this, run far far away.

181993,comment,181513,181748,0,0,jrockway,,,"Sure, it scales.  But it isn't a very good language.  (The word ""blub"" comes to mind.)<p>Here are features I like to have (in no particular order):<p><pre><code>  * lexically-scoped variables (and closures)\n  * lambdas\n  * continuations\n  * macros\n  * an object system with a MOP (PHP and Java fail miserably here)\n  * powerful regex engine (can be added via libraries, so not too critical)\n  * extensive module library\n  * flexibility (I want to write code my way, not the way someone else thinks I should write it; bye bye, Python.)\n</code></pre>\nThings that are nice to have:<p><pre><code>  * multiple dispatch OO\n  * partial evaluation\n  * laziness\n</code></pre>\nPHP has none of these features.  That's why I don't use it and don't recommend it.  And oh yeah... PHP is a templating system too.  I would rather get that as a library, not a core feature.  (But I won't count that against them.)<p>So what language does have all these features?  None :)<p>But, Lisp and Perl are good compromises.  CL does everything except continuations and having a decent module library; Perl does everything except have pretty syntax and macros.  Sadly neither of those languages has (by default) the ""optional features"", which is a shame.  I ranted about this on my blog:<p><a href=""http://blog.jrock.us/articles/Syntax%20and%20features.pod"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.jrock.us/articles/Syntax%20and%20features.pod</a><p>Anyway, PHP is junk in terms of a programming language.

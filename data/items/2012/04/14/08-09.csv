3840320,comment,3839099,3839939,7,0,ataggart,,,"My compilers class was a nightmare (and we used the Dragon book).  I had hoped a compilers course would actually teach about the full process by which a text file becomes executable 1s and 0s.  Instead it was a months-long torture of parsing text.  Regex to NFA, NFA to regex, regex to DFA, NFA to DFA, DFA minimization, LL(1), LR(0), SLR(1), LR(1), LALR(1), along with memorizing all the rules governing which grammars are amenable to which parser, and working through all of the preceding by hand.  And then finally about a week of teach-yourself-LLVM.<p>I don't know if ""compilers are a solved problem"", but I'm pretty damned sure that the only people who need to know that much about text parsing know who they are, and would be able to reference it when needed.  As an undergraduate course, it was utterly worthless.",1334393912

The hardest design work to do is when you're a long way personally from the market the design is built for.<p>If I was wearing my design critique hat I'd be asking Kyro this though:<p>* Why is ""Welcome to the future"" - which tells you nothing about the product - pushed above the ""Control iTunes and Spotify Using Gestures"" sub - which does. The former is tone and mood setting device - why am I not picking up that tone and mood from the visual design? If I am is it necessary? What is it's purpose?<p>* Why move the video and social proof so far down the page - are they really less important?<p>* Is the navigation bar at the top really necessary? (home == your there. features == this page should convince, download == pretty darn obvious). Are there more useful things we can use that vertical space for? (see previous point)<p>* The logo is still a bit ""meh"" to my eyes - but I suspect Kyro already knows that and it wasn't the focus of the changes done.<p>* The background noise on the main image is a little bit strong to my eyes and pull the eye away from the content a bit<p>* Is the ""Flutter in the news"" headline necessary? If you take it away will the reader be confused?<p>* The move lines on the hand don't quite work. ""Why is the hand sweating"" was a comment from my partner :-)",1334393446

There are free ones too (for example, <a href=""http://domainmx.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://domainmx.net/</a> -- if you are willing to trust any third party, with your data, or can convince everyone emailing you to use encryption) but, even the pay services put us squarely back in the realm of not owning our data. I can use Gmail that way already (as intermediate storage for when my server's not running, and I can use + in addresses to sort incoming mail for local users).<p>What gets me is that email was one of the first peer-to-peer networks, and 90% of people, including myself, on residential links, are excluded from using it as designed. It seems more wrong to pay to solve a man-made problem. Free webmail is ""good enough"" if I'm just going to pull my messages offline and use it as a relay...<p>I remember there being ""more internet"" on my 28kbps modem... Port 25 and 80 worked from home, SMTP servers didn't reject mail from anyone on a residential ISP. I actually wrote a letter to my ISPs when they started blocking SMTP (yeah, I'm THAT guy)... Their argument was ""but spammers,"" and they wouldn't make an exception for 1 out of a thousand. I even wound up switching providers over it. A year later everyone was doing it and there was no stand left to make. Spam is our ""airport security"" scarecrow (among others... copyright, porn, etc)... We'll undo the whole thing if we have to.<p>And so Gmail it is, until Email 2.0 comes around, and is new enough not to be intentionally broken, or I decide to shell out and <i>license</i> the real internet from my oversubscribed ISP that throttles uploads so noone can offer new and interesting services using their networks that might compete with them.<p>Don't get me started on QoS -- the neutrality killer...

On Meteor the database API is the same on client and server, but that's just an API.  A Mongo command on the client doesn't go directly to MongoDB on the server.  You could have an access layer (or controller) on the server thru which all client requests are passed.

I have been reading HN for awhile now but never made a post. This was more of a test to see what sort of a response this got, without putting any work into it. The problem with any pitch over a forum is that it's sometimes hard to grasp due to lack of visuals and seeing it live. Regardless of the lack of response, it really doesnt mean much.

3840254,comment,3838880,3840014,0,0,FreakLegion,,,"Antagonistic toward whom? It's a fact that Valve hired IceFrog, apparently thinking it an acquisition of DotA (like they did with Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, etc.). It's also a fact that IceFrog was neither the original creator of DotA (Eul was) nor the person who elevated it from a merely very popular mod to a worldwide sensation (Steve Feak was[1]). So it's always seemed to me that Valve skipped their due diligence on IceFrog -- otherwise why hire him? He didn't create DotA, was only tangentially responsible for its success, and doesn't own it[2]. On the other hand, he brings with him the good will of the community and a claim to the DOTA trademark based on use, regardless of whether the underlying IP belongs to him.<p>Thus, Valve's decision to hire him has always puzzled me[3]. Did they do it simply because of his claim on the trademark and his relationship with the DotA community? I have no idea. Based on this article, it seems there's at least one other possibility: they were too trusting and didn't have the organizational infrastructure to do a thorough background check (and possibly still don't realize where IceFrog stands in the history of DotA development). We'll never know what Valve's real motivation was, but I[4] at least have lost a fair bit of respect for them since this whole thing started.<p>Edit: I agree with you that neither Blizzard nor Valve should have the trademark. Ideally I'd like to see it ruled generic.<p>1. For all that it matters at this point, Feak did this without Eul's permission, and has profited enormously from infringing Eul's work.<p>2. Though trademarks are different from other forms of IP and it's not impossible that Valve will end up with the mark anyway. But regardless of who owns the mark, the characters and such in DotA aren't IceFrog's IP, and could be used by other people in other games.<p>3. This because, aside from these considerations, he's a not a great coder and has no art or other skills. So Valve can't have hired him for technical expertise. If he was a superstar developer I'd happily chalk it up to that.<p>4. Disclosure: I was heavily involved in the Warcraft III modding community from before the original DotA up to the release of StarCraft II. I watched this all play out in real-time, which absolutely colors my take on it.",1334391304

We are strictly focused on people. Rank and influence in areas you are passionate about will be a big part of Seshn. Also, Tumblr puts a strong emphasis on reblogging, which totally makes sense for them. Not for us. We want people to put value in creating original content themselves and not just sharing a bunch of things that have been shared over and over again. That is so noisy. Thanks for your comment.

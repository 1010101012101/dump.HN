So give me a way of knowing if I&#39;ve sparked anything!<p>Also, it&#39;d be nice to see on the list pages something along the lines of &#34;N comments (most recent M |minutes|hours|days ago)&#34;",1172439376

1070,comment,1044,1044,0,0,joshwa,,,"I&#39;ve been thinking about this in relation to my startup-- it would be great to have a really low-friction way for my users to create accounts, and to say, &#34;well, if you already have an AIM account or a LiveJournal account, just use those credentials&#34;.<p>But I think the average user might need some education on this, as they might suspect that my site is just a phishing scheme? I.e. why would I be asking for their password to another site?<p>I wonder if I could autodiscover existing openID credentials/other accounts as part of my signup process? Kind of how 30boxes can autodiscover myspace accounts based on an email address... I&#39;m trying to envision what that user experience could be like.<p>Ideas, anyone?",1172438379

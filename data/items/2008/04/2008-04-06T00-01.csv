If you're not willing to offer that, why should someone else accept it?<p>BTW - Part-time isn't necessarily attractive.  It only works for folks who have a hole in their schedule.  You might get more takers for temp than part-time.",1207443281

You'd be surprised at some of the stuff startups have to do to get out there and get initial traction, not limited to spam and ""faking it till you make it"".<p>The only thing that surprises me is that they were putting up fake reviews so late into the game.  The benefits weren't that great at that point, and the risks at least mediocre. It just looks like laziness, if anything.  Maybe they wanted to artificially stimulate some growth prior to that new funding round and possibly trying to get acquired, and fake reviews are just one of many methods used at once.",1207441472
155891,comment,149052,154107,0,0,mejohnsn,,,"The problem with this proposal is that it ignores the fundamental problem behind any flamebait: that flamebait qua flamebait is not _intended_ as serious discussion, nor as a prelude to serious discussion.<p>The proven technique for dealing with flamebait is to tag it immediately for what it is, and not waste any reader's time with a detailed discussion of an idea that is not even worthy of refutation.<p>And yes, even Aristotle in the Topics agreed that there are propositions/arguments that are so silly or vain, they are not worthy of a serious refutation. Flamebait certainly counts as one of these. (BTW: I see there are Aquinas fans here, so I will point out that Aquinas expressed his agreement with this in, of all places, his commentary on the Ethics: I think it was Lecture I).<p>The only problem is that there really are people who are too quick to tag someone else's post as 'flamebait', even when it is not. This happens on those very topics that most need to be seriously discussed, simply because they are so important, yet so many people hold strong opinions on them, opinions that are not founded on sound logic, but on passionate attachment of one kind or another. So they are strong opinions, but they are wrong opinions. These are the
discussions that are the most difficult. They should not be attempted by amateurs. But there is no enforcing of _this_ principle on the Internet;)",1207441401

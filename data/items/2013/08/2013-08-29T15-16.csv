6296541,comment,6296132,6296132,3,0,bsenftner,,,"Forget about moving to Los Angeles. The culture shock of simply changing countries will take more than a year to get used to, and during that period you&#x27;ll be uncertain about your decision, uncertain about your sustainability in expensive LA, not knowing the city there is a strong likelihood you&#x27;ll move into an unsafe area, and you&#x27;ll get crazy lonely in this large place.<p>Exactly when you need the most confidence, you won&#x27;t have any.<p>Plus, let&#x27;s say you do move, and you get extra parts and take some acting lessons... &quot;acting&quot; is performing someone else&#x27;s script, ideas and emotions. If you really want to be a successful Hollywood actor, you don&#x27;t begin in Hollywood. You begin right where you come from, and you start making your own stories.<p>You have a unique life story, with hopes and dreams and trials and crisis. Being a successful Hollywood actor is &quot;nothing more&quot; than being able to communicate the life experience though your filmed actions. However, that is extremely hard. And &quot;Hollywood&quot; is not very consistent at communicating the life experience well. That&#x27;s the whole point behind the award shows: so much disposable media is created, when the few that actually convey our trials in life are released we celebrate because that successful communication is so rare.<p>I recommend you start creating your own short films. You can shoot on a mobile phone - TV shows and at least one feature has been shot on a mobile phone (www.olivethemovie.com).<p>Now here&#x27;s the difficult bit: you do this, regardless of feeling embarrassed by your family, friends and environment; regardless of not having the money or the skills to create your own shorts. You do this because you have to or you will die inside. Seek out people in the Malaysian media industries, see how productions are created by being a non-actor gofer, and learn how to create productions yourself. And start creating them, even before you know how. Just do it. Iterate again and again. Develop your writing, production creation, and acting all at once, and do it locally where you are today.<p>If and when you develop your skill as a story teller and actor, and you are honest in your stories about the human condition... Hollywood will come to your door and ask for you by name. Honesty and the ability to communicate that is what causes Hollywood to take notice.",1377791860

There have been many cases of kind autocrats who are loved by the people and who govern with their consent.<p>Many in the US are biased by the allure of democratic formalities and lose sight of the larger principle which is consent.  Whether you vote or not, if you do not dissent then you consent to whatever is happening.  This is true in any kind of regime, democratic or not.<p>I&#x27;d argue that it is the duty of all citizens to dissent aggressively when leaders act badly. This can take the form of voting behavior, public or private discourse, letter writing, fundraising, boycotting, civil disobedience, etc.<p>The contract between the people and their leaders should be reevaluated every hour of every day, not just viewed in retrospect after the 4 year term is over.  Impeachment is an extreme measure, and too much of it is bad for the stability of our institutions, but the threat of it should be very real.<p>But just as stability is important for our institutions, so is trust.  If the people cannot trust the president&#x27;s words, that is just as large a threat to our stability as an impeachment proceeding.<p>We have granted our leaders the privilege of keeping some state secrets.  They have taken that trust and created a massive surveillance infrastructure that goes well beyond what anyone imagined and well beyond the intent of the law.  Now it is time to reduce the level of trust and dial back the excesses.<p>So far our leaders have shown no inclination to engage in a mutually respectful dialog with the public about the excesses (or about the crimes revealed by the leaks, for that matter).  This conduct weakens our institutions more than most people realize.  It is not only profoundly undemocratic, it is also profoundly disrespectful of the democracy that so many have fought to achieve.",1377791632

China has more than double the number of internet users than the US[2], and this is increasing rapidly. We also know that Google has a mind to capture the burgeoning Chinese market, so the relevance of this number to them is pretty substantial. India and Japan combined also equals the US&#x27;s internet user count.<p>If you look at the top-10 in that list, it accounts for about 1.4 billion internet users. Of those, about 309 million come from English-speaking countries. 462 million if you&#x27;re including all western European languages (romance languages).<p>We know that, by sheer economic force, wealthy developed countries occupy the lion&#x27;s share of Google revenues (the USA represents ~10% of all internet users, but 45% of Google&#x27;s revenues). In terms of raw users impacted though, that&#x27;s quite different. Google has no lack of users from non-English countries.<p>But forget all of this for a second and assume that your numbers are in the ballpark. 60-70% English, moving up to 90% if you include western European &quot;romance&quot; languages (Latin and Germanic languages aren&#x27;t the same thing, but whatever). Having <i>just</i> finished translating a large app into French, Spanish, Portuguese, and German, I&#x27;ll say that &quot;romance&quot; languages aren&#x27;t any easier to translate. French for example tends to run long, and provides huge headaches in any UI that&#x27;s even remotely space constrained. German tends to mess up line breaks with long compound words, and there are a puzzling number of common verbs in Portuguese and Spanish that run much longer than you would expect them to. All of that requires babysitting and constant iteration to ensure everything fits, reads write, and works right.<p>And you can see this with Google - they haven&#x27;t gone <i>all</i> pictographic in their UIs. Instead they&#x27;ve most heavily iconified parts of their UI that are space-constrained. Toolbars are the canonical example.

I don&#x27;t think Samsung ever made a serious, competitive Windows Phone. Also Lumia is not selling the volume it&#x27;s selling just because of the OS (actually for some is a disadvantage because of the smaller marketplace). It would be interesting to see how a Lumia with Android would fare.<p>Anyway, three years ago Samsung had 5% of the market and Nokia over 35%. They had a good lead over everyone no matter what OS they decided to back. Admittedly going with Android would have meant that they would have more competition, but I believe that they had a good chance on brand recognition alone.

Even if you manage to organize your modules in a perfect, non-leaking tree and to only reference bug-free, well-documented external libraries, you still have two fundamental problems:<p>1. Each module necessarily has access to functionality provided by all its &quot;ancestors&quot;. In the best case, this number still grows logarithmically with project size, and accordingly the difficulty of adding or modifying code in a &quot;leaf&quot; module.<p>2. New libraries and language features are generally seen as a neverending bonanza. But before you can effectively modify a module you need to understand how it currently works, which necessarily involves understanding the external tools used in it (quirks and all). As the variety of these external tools increases with code size (at quite possibly a super-linear rate), the complexity of working with any given module deepens accordingly.<p>The Holy Grail of software development would of course be perfect layering: each layer completely masks its predecessor, and is no more complex. Someone who achieved it could indefinitely roll off as much useful code on day 500+ as they did on day 1. But I&#x27;m not aware of any practice or methodology that dares to even remotely promise such utopian benefits.",1377789076

One meta package would get clunky to use, but require less package maintenance (and instead require more configuration/maintenance on the target)<p>2. Make one package for the web application. You can put the database.properties as a post-install configure section if you already know what it should be, or have it run a script on the target that loads the correct variables. Or make separate packages just for the database.properties. Again, it comes down to where you want to do maintenance.<p>3. This one isn&#x27;t too difficult. Use /etc/cron.d/ and name your cron jobs uniquely based on what they do. Then make packages however you want. Even if multiple packages deliver the same cron job (more than once), you&#x27;re just overwriting a file that already exists, so no duplicates. If that causes a conflict you can deliver to a temp location and have a %post section test if the target cron file already exists, and delete the temp file.<p>4. This is where slotted services (admittedly a term I made up) comes in handy. No package managers really deal with this properly, which is where a completely virtualized service becomes a much easier way to handle it. But you can still install a chroot directory and run the service from it using just package manager, no deploy tool required. Optionally, you can also build a set of packages and dependencies and install them to version-specific directories, and set up directories of symlinks to the versions you want, and target your application at the symlink-directory-tree that matches the versions you want to run. It can be a hassle if you don&#x27;t have a tool to do it for you. I think there are some existing open source tools designed to do this, but I haven&#x27;t used them.<p>(That was for running <i>15 different versions of tomcat</i>, by the way. If you just want to run tomcat with different configurations, just make your configs and run tomcat for each instance! The scripts that ship with tomcat already support instance-specific configurations; iirc, HOME_DIR was the base path, and INSTANCE_DIR was the instance-specific configuration path, or something similar)<p>Everything you mentioned is relevant to development. And i&#x27;m not trying to discount real configuration management. If anything, it&#x27;s critical to use a real configuration management tool to manage large, complex sets of configurations across large orgs. Using a package manager is just an easy <i>deploy tool</i> for the configuration, but how you manage it is left as an exercise for the engineer.<p>(That being said: why don&#x27;t deploy tools incorporate change management, persistent locking, user authentication, pre/post install hooks, and audit trails? We need more open source solutions that fulfill enterprise requirements)",1377788997

Not to mention fierce competition from the European equivalent to K-12 education.<p>The rise of the nazis happened in a situation where it was competing in a marketplace of ideas where a substantial majority of the population o the countries involved had first hand experience with the effects of World War I, and <i>despite that</i> the nazi&#x27;s still succeeded in getting enough support in elections to be able to form an elected government.<p>The nazi rise to power was a horrific demonstration of just how easy it is to ignore history even when the knowledge is widespread.

If your product does not prominently state that it is toe jam and ear wax, and in any way present it as hot dogs, you&#x27;d go down for misleading advertising and likely for fraud.

It needs to be able to infect a machine then spread. Most Linux installations use a security model that requires an administrative (root or sudo) password to install software. The biggest challenge that virus authors have when targeting &quot;Linux&quot; is the wide range of distros.<p>When you target Windoze you can write a .exe file and convince your victim to execute it. What type of file would you use to attack Linux users? If they use RPM, you could use a .RPM file. If they use Debian or Ubuntu, you could provide a .deb file. If you are attempting to send your virus to every email address in the victim&#x27;s address book, you would need to know the package manager of the victim before deciding which attack package to distribute. Certainly, you could distribute the package as a script which determines the OS then grabs the appropriate package from a repository and installs it, but then you&#x27;re exposing a lot of information about your attack to every victim. Eventually someone catches it.<p>So no Linux is not immune to viruses, but it&#x27;s more the platform than the audience that prevents these attacks. When you want to attack Linux users, use a rootkit instead. Actually... please don&#x27;t attack Linux users, there are enough Windoze users out there, and you shouldn&#x27;t attack them either... because... ethics",1377788603

Rather, we assert a political causation for the  observed correlation that nations with stringent gun controls tend to have much higher murder rates than nations that allow guns. The political causation is that nations which have violence problems tend to adopt severe gun controls, but these do not reduce violence, which is determined by basic sociocultural and economic factors.</i><p>Stringent gun control policies tend to appear in nations and/or regions where violence is <i>already</i> a problem. This study merely underlines the futility of any single tunnel-visioned policy - people who are willing to commit murder, are also willing to expend effort to find any weapon(s) to allow them to proceed in their endeavours.<p>Here in Finland, we have quite a few weapons, but they are rarely used in violent crimes.

278308,comment,278120,278127,0,0,netcan,,,">""That makes me really sad""<p>Id say it makes a lot of people angry. It's also another step in making people reconsider the concept of copyright for music.<p>I think someone's mentioned it here in the discussion: Copyright protection is not an inalienable right (like the right to remain silent), it's an instrument designed to have some desirable result (like tax deductions). Copyright in this case is preventing innovative products & services, and very probably harmful to the art itself. 'Small' artists & genres have the most to gain from the potential of free music.",1218970629

The artists could register their songs in some sort of online database, with the price they are willing to accept. This would make a free market where the artists could decide what their songs are worth.<p>I don't think the artists in RIAA would be the first users of this database, but independent labels might be interested. An unknown artist could set a lower price to make their music more attractive for radio stations.",1218970566
278306,comment,277948,278059,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I'm pretty sure this specific point was addressed directly in the Wikipedia article you linked earlier, under the ""In science"" section.<p>Within the confines of science, and outside the consideration of religion, philosophy, or faith, free will simply refers to the limits of determinism. i.e., is it possible to have enough information about the initial state of someone's life to perfectly predict all of their actions? At the moment, quantum mechanics says no, and so science says we have free will.<p>However, it's not a black-and-white, on-or-off thing either. Psychology and sociology can both make predictions about a person's life based on specifics of the person's initial state, and as genetics and biological sciences continue to touch borders with psychology, we find more and more that there are physical forces which influence the way people behave.<p>So, to what extent is there free will? If someone is born with the genetic traits for schizophrenia -- pre-determined by their parents, and their parents before them, and so on -- then just how much free will does that person have?<p>The question of determinism has nothing necessarily to do with religion.",1218970545

278297,comment,275112,275112,0,0,Shorel,,,"Windows Server has been painless for me. We use MSSQL Server which is a good database, much better than your MySQL.<p>We use PHP, ASP and ASP.NET in no particular order. I prefer PHP and use PHP. It works flawlessly in IIS.<p>Also, the subversion server is very easy to manage (tortoiseSVN to create repositories, etc).<p>However, for email, Linux is much better.  Email hosting in Windows sucks. MS wants you to buy Exchange.<p>This is my experience with a dedicated Windows box. Shared hosting in a Windows machine is the world of pain other posts describe.",1218968198

Good IDEs are a superset of good text editors.<p>Maybe I'm missing something, but this didn't look like too good an article. It looked like a big morass with ""Paul Graham"" stuck in about half-way down, no doubt triggering the auto-feed into HN. (grin)",1218967726

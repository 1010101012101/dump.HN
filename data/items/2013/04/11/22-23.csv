If you had selected a random sample of people and placed them in jobs in Google, then sure, that would provide a lot of evidence that academic performance doesn't matter.  But that isn't what happened: this is a sample of people who already made it past the Google hiring filter, which allegedly is placing too much weight on credentials.<p>If the premise of the original article was correct though, you would expect that the uncredentialed people who made it past the hiring bar would be far stronger than the people who got an unjustified boost based on their credentials and the prejudices.<p>If it's true that easy-to-measure academic credentials are basically uncorrelated with job performance, then that's probably a good indication that their hiring process actually is well-calibrated: if people with poor credentials were doing better than people with good credentials, then their hiring process isn't giving sufficient weight to non-academic factors.

My co-founder and I were both successful professional poker players and coaches at the time, but we were young (20ish) and all but clueless about technology. I still think the market opportunity was there, but we hired an agency who outsourced everything, made bad tech choices, took forever, and gave us a fraction of what we originally agreed on. I learned to program myself in order to complete a major component of the site (in flash) which they had just completely botched.<p>What we ended up with wasn't <i>terrible</i>, but it fell way short of the vision we had, and our marketing efforts fell mostly flat as well. We were able to recruit a few smart people to post and discuss hands here and there, and we wrote a few articles ourselves that showcased the flash hand analysis tool I had built (the best functioning aspect of the site), but we weren't getting any other traffic. There were a few bugs and an assortment of minor ux issues which made the site feel a bit clunky, and people's feedback was pretty unenthusiastic, so all in all we weren't feeling very good about the direction of things. It didn't take very long (maybe six weeks or so) before we threw in the towel.<p>It wasn't a complete failure--after all, I had learned how to program and discovered that I quite liked it (certainly much more than grinding poker online), and both of us had learned a lot of lessons about business and technology. But there was another lesson that we only discovered with time.<p>Even after we completely abandoned the site and it went dormant, I would still check google analytics from time to time to see if there was any traffic, and an interesting trend started to emerge: a few of the hand posts and articles we had posted were developing really steady search traffic. One article in particular was generating something like 20 uniques per day.<p>At that point, we were both just done with the whole endeavor and had no motivation to try to pick it up again, but we realized that if we had kept at it and continued to create more and more quality content, that we probably could have had an seo goldmine on our hands, developed reputations as poker strategy bloggers, and leveraged that into the community we had originally envisioned.

This is kind of a leaky abstraction - you are pretending to have many rows on the screen but you are unable to hide the fact that you don't because you are breaking the in-page search. You will never be able to fix this in all, maybe not even in most cases - your search box looks nothing like my Opera search box. But it does not stop with in-page search - you are probably breaking select all, printing, scroll bars and what about zooming? And what if I change my keyboard shortcut for in-page search or use the menu to invoke it?<p>All that aside in my opinion the mistake is to allow the user to have hundreds of thousands of rows on the screen - real or virtual - in the first place. What a waste of time to scroll through that. I would just offer filters that almost immediately update the set of matching rows and display the first few and maybe highlight the match in each row. When the user scrolls to the bottom you can load more rows either automatically or by pressing a button.<p>The user will understand what is going on, is encouraged to filter instead of randomly scrolling through thousands of rows and everything from in-page search to printing works just as expected. And last but not least it is probably much simpler than your solution. (And the user is still able to scroll through all rows and in almost all cases they will stop way before the page size becomes a problem for the browser besides you are using an old phone, but whoever attempts to scroll through thousands of rows on a phone probably deserves the result.)",1365719327

But worries about such perfection slowed or discouraged others from building something similar or better before now.<p>In that way, Bitcoin's a bit like Linux or the Web: an ad-hoc success where more professional approaches had stalled, in development or adoption. It likely has some success-bringing aspects that even its designers and current maintainer don't fully understand, but lucked-into. Sometimes these things are only fully appreciated in retropect.<p>Also like Linux or the Web, a lot of formalization and hardening can be bolted on later, now that the essential utility is proven and the potential rewards for fixes are clear. Even if giant parts of the existing system collapse -- the SHA256-based mining, the P2P transaction broadcasts, the bloated global blockchain -- if the ledger of keys & balances survives, multiple teams will then try to reboot a next-gen system that allows those balances to keep trading.<p>(I conjecture that crypto control of 1 BTC today might wind up, a decade or two hence, spawning usable balances in a number of official and unofficial offshoot projects... vaguely like how 100 shares in the original AT&T eventually wound up becoming shares in both AT&T and the 7 'baby bells'. We will see 'baby Bitcoins' in the future, which attempt to accelerate their adoption by endowing everyone wiht a Bitcoin balance a balance in the new system as well.)",1365718262

In order to have any value left for the founders and employees, the company will have to sell for some huge valuation that they are almost certainly not going to get.<p>I'm not questioning the decision on the Foursquare side anyway, although they are clearly avoiding releasing any data that would give people an understanding of the current state of the company.  I question the decision on the part of the investors.  This is a lot of money to put in, and for what?  The best case might be a 2x-3x return, but in my opinion the median return on this is $0, all the money spent and virtually no value in the end.<p>I would imagine it's very hard for the management of FourSquare to let go emotionally, especially after hopes ran high in 2009/2010 and they had huge growth.  It's clear that that growth has ended, and that they are now in a period of declining use.  Combine that with an inability to monazite the existing user base and I see absolutely no hope of success.<p>I suppose they could pivot the company, but why would they do that?  It would make far more sense to leave FourSquare and build a new company that didn't have all of FourSquare's baggage and dilution from investments in the old model.",1365718153

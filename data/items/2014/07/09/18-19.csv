They performed IQ test, life history, psychiatric, and sexual life interviews. The participants also took a questioner independently, under constant supervision. The data that was collected showed us that 70% or 2/3 of the findings in IQ could be traced back to genetic variations. Adult monozygotic twins are equally similar in physiology and psychological traits. \n\tThe findings were very surprising, being raised by the same parents or in different homes doesn’t have anything to do with making siblings grow up to be alike. Like as said with Nature vs Nurture individuals choose how they react in situations, as for their thoughts, emotions, and actions. Nature and Nurture both are very influential to what makes us who we are and we need both nature and nurture equally.",1404932371

Then again you blow more money and labor and labor is money, on software for virtualization.  Then again management and backup is usually simpler with virtualization, except when it isn&#x27;t like when vmware and the NAS kills your mysql instances on an image when you run a backup and it starves the kernel for 60+ seconds of IO whoops.<p>On average it ends up being about the same performance as non virtualized for a given amount of $$$$ but its much more flexible and responsive to change, which sometimes is worth it.",1404932220

It reminds me of the case of a man pulled over for a minor infraction (not wearing a seatbelt?) and the cop was <i>convinced</i> the man had drugs. He searched the man, the car, and found nothing. Called a search dog. Claimed the dog found something - and wanted a cavity search. Dragged the man to a hospital to <i>force</i> him to be cavity searched - the doctor refused. At the next hospital, the doctor agreed. They found nothing, of course. Then, the hospital proceeded to <i>bill the man they searched for the procedure</i>. He&#x27;s suing the hell out of the police department, but who knows what will happen.[1]<p>And then of course there was this woman, who had something similar happen.[2] And you know that they are not the only ones - they are just the ones who made a stink about it and got national news coverage.<p>More generally, prosecutors love leverage, the more the better (which is a big reason why they don&#x27;t want to legalize pot).

The truth is that they are vicious, prejudiced bullies who have a tremendous amount of unchecked power and almost no accountability, operating within a complicated system that they have mastered against suspects who are often cowed in to pleading guilty just to avoid inordinate punishment for things they never did.

8011508,comment,8006997,8010780,1,0,thinkpad20,,,"Scheme and Haskell are very different languages. Both are functional, but that&#x27;s about where the similarities end. Scheme is impure, haskell is pure; scheme is strict, haskell lazy; scheme is dynamically typed, haskell static; all functions in scheme are variadic, all in Haskell are unary; etc. So it depends on what you&#x27;re looking for, and what you&#x27;re trying to use it to do. That said, here are some advantages of Haskell:<p>1) Speed. Haskell binaries are highly optimized and tend to be very fast.<p>2) Correctness. Haskell&#x27;s type system is far more advanced than any other language with as much or more usage, and is very good at preventing runtime errors. (and can go a long way to preventing logic errors). Also, its purity prevents huge classes of bugs.<p>3) Interesting: Haskell introduces a lot of new concepts which can really open up your understanding of computer science. It&#x27;s a lot of fun.<p>4) Forward-looking: many of the ideas introduced or popularized by Haskell, such as pattern-matching, type classes, no null pointers, etc, are manifesting themselves in the new languages these days (such as Rust and Swift). Haskell itself is also (slowly) making its way into industry. Learning Haskell, in some ways, exposes you to the &quot;next generation&quot; of languages and programming techniques. I&#x27;m not sure the same can be said of Scheme, which tends to be used pedagogically more than as a means to push the envelope.<p>Then again, I know Haskell a lot better than I know Scheme, so maybe I&#x27;m biased.

Buying several hot dogs and buns at once--keeping them refrigerated, and heating what you eat in the microwave--is a lot cheaper in the long run than buying one pre-warmed hot dog from the convenience store whenever you get hungry.<p>A car that starts and operates reliably is so valuable in America that people would rather give up their houses and live in their cars than vice versa.  Even the east coast, where the original municipal architecture predated cars, rather heavily relied upon horses for transportation.  We have never been friendly to pedestrian travel (but pedestrian competitions are another story).<p>If you do not have a car, you are automatically a de facto second-class citizen.  The smart thing to do is buy a used car near the start of the bottom of its bathtub curve of reliability, repair it until near the end, and then stop.  You then buy your next used car, and it is your backup vehicle for when your original beater finally dies.  So the most cost-effective transportation solution is often to have two cars: one older beater/grocery-getter and one newer and more reliable backup.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how many people are in your family.  If you are poor, your car may be getting close to being uneconomical to repair, and you will still need to get around whenever it is undriveable.<p>Even the original article confirms this.  Honda broke down.  Mercedes was the backup.<p>Everybody does this if they can.  If your car is in any way unreliable, you secure temporary backup transportation before it breaks down.  If you have money, you can rent a car for a week, or use a loaner from your repair shop.  If you don&#x27;t, you must have a friend or relative that can drive you to and from work until you get your car back.<p>The outrage is as incomprehensible to me as being shocked if a poor soldier carries an expensive rifle, or if a poor electrician has an expensive fiberglass ladder instead of a cheaper aluminum one, or if a poor plumber installs expensive copper in his own house instead of PVC pipe and zinc fittings.  You do not begrudge people the tools they need to do their jobs, so why would you complain about those they use to live their lives?<p>Too many people obsess over <i>cost</i> and ignore <i>value</i>.  A capital investment may cost more initially, but it definitely provides more value over its useful lifespan.<p>So when you see a welfare recipient with a complete suite of kitchen appliances, two cars, and maybe even a television and Internet-connected computer, you can tell yourself that there is a person who can bounce themselves back out of the safety net someday, and probably sooner rather than later.  Even if they don&#x27;t, they might be able to throw a child out far enough for them to lower a rope back down.  When you see the person that doesn&#x27;t even have a grocery cart, that person is the one that will be costing the system the most money in the long run.  Suggesting that people sell the things that help them survive and save money is absolutely the worst thing you can tell them.<p>So you keep the Mercedes.  Start looking out for a used car to replace the old Honda that broke down.  If you get tired of people giving you funny looks, get a can of rust-colored automotive paint and simulate some old body damage with it.  Above all, you don&#x27;t make stupid economic decisions because the people around you can&#x27;t recognize a smart one.",1404931362

So more than just the FS but also some memory / cpu limiting and general sandboxing.<p>Interestingly most &quot;real virtualization&quot; requires somewhat recent hardware but LXC containers don&#x27;t take much if any, so &quot;free machine off junk heap&quot; is good enough for experimentation.<p>Historically there have been strange intercontainer isolation problems so don&#x27;t assume its as perfect as hardware assisted virtualization.<p>Also you&#x27;re sharing a kernel which is both good and bad, if you were hoping to test out a new kernel or run an entirely different OS, thats too bad.<p>Edited to add, another fun analogy if you like the chroot analogy, is when spinning up a process was glacial on windows (but not too bad on linux) that lead to the development and push to use threads which were a huge win on slow windows not so much on linux but we got dragged along anyway.  In a similar manner, full virtualization is really slow to deploy and spin up and spin down, containers are smaller and weaker but much like threads vs processes are much faster to start up or shutdown.  A really low latency or fast spinup spindown virtualization tech would probably wipe most demand for containerization.  Or what I&#x27;m getting at is, spawning processes on windows was super slow, so we got threads, and spawning full hardware virt is slow, so we get containerization aka chroot++",1404930955

Because the functions served by this machine may change over time -- so any descriptive name you use may become confusingly inaccurate.<p>But you need a way to refer to the _machine_ itself, whose functions may change over time. The best way to do this is to pick a _non-descriptive_ unique identifier that will always refer to that machine. As the OP mentions, that non-descriptive unique identifier &quot;will mostly be useful to operations engineers, remote hands, and for record keeping.&quot;<p>Then you make a descriptive name as a CNAME. Which, they don&#x27;t mention, but it might change over time what that CNAME points to etc.<p>I have found this general principle to be a very good one even in my much smaller shop. When we used descriptive names as the &#x27;main&#x27; canonical machine name, this led to huge confusion when roles changed -- you either had descriptive names that were no longer accurate or confusing, or you changed them but still had documentation or notes or tickets referring to the old name, etc.<p>The rest of the OP goes into a suggested scheme for making the descriptive names (the CNAME&#x27;s), in a way that will actually _be_ descriptive of what developers and ops will need to know. Their scheme seems pretty decent to me, but definitely depends on the particular context and domain of the shop, including how many machines you have, if they are geographically dispersed, etc.<p>But the basic concept of using a _non-descriptive_ name as the basic machine name A record, with descriptive names being CNAMES to it -- is I think pretty widely applicable and wise. (And that mnemonic projet list is pretty useful for creating non-descriptive unique identifiers that are still easy to remember and record).",1404929782

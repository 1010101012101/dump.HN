From a design point of view (visually encoding information that is) the layout doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense though. Putting one team above the other (as ntaso pointed out) isn&#x27;t a good idea. Not only does it imply ranking, it also takes away the opportunity to show which team plays on which side and can&#x27;t handle double-digit scores all that well. &quot;FRA 7 : 11 BRA&quot; works a lot better. I can see why they did it though. If the teams weren&#x27;t stacked there wouldn&#x27;t have been any room for the pretty clock (which I like a lot). But that&#x27;s not how design is supposed to work. The indicators next to the team&#x27;s names are completely unnecessary. Which score belongs to which team seems fairly obvious.<p>The info graphics part seems a bit over the top as well. A (animated?) clock icon, the time itself and the subtitle &quot;Local Time&quot; seems a bit redundant. Surely the unit explains what the information is supposed to be. &quot;96,000 people&quot; doesn&#x27;t need &quot;Attendance&quot; added to it. Let alone the huge icon. The local temperature doesn&#x27;t have a subtitle and I figured out what it is anyway. And again, the indicators ...<p>The &quot;POSSESSION&quot; (not sure why this one is all caps) graphic I like. Kind of. Three indicators - really?. The one in the middle makes perfect sense but the other two? The shirts are unnecessary as well.

1. I took the guy who offended me to an informal cup of coffee and discussed about the situation. 
2. Instead of confronting him, I explained my perspective and sought out his guidance to help me out.<p>It did help me in two ways :
1. The other person realized that I&#x27;m another human being just like him and not some &quot;ideal code cranking robot&quot; that he expected me to be !  He even apologized at some point for any offense he would have caused, explained his reasons and assured me that it was not personal.
2. I realized that he was under similar stress for meeting his own challenges / expectations laid out to him by his superiors.  So, helped me feel better about myself , that the situation was caused mostly due to his inability to communicate rather than any fault from my end !",1444118331

may give further insight. from the picture, one can estimate that lights are separated by approx 20 meters, and the length of the lighted border is about 2000 km. This gives about 100 000 floodlights, which is consistent with the Wikipedia figure. Those lights seem rather powerful. I would not be astonished if they were 1kW each (might be much smaller if made of LED, but the yellow-ish color suggests it&#x27;s not). This gives 100 MW of lighting power.

In order for an idea to be sold, its presentation must resonate with its audience. That means it must latch onto their beliefs as well as those facts that have been proven to them, and it must leverage those conceptual building blocks to bring them up to date with this new logical composition. With no frame of reference, how should anyone know where a product fits in? No one other than the innovator can be expected to have such a vision—after all, how often is the next trend predicted? In retrospect, analogies to past breakouts become apparent. Being analogous to pre-existing innovations is not mutually exclusive with being novel and creative; in this new age, we will soon find that all new developments are built solely at a higher level, on the foundation comprising progress thus far. We therefore cannot present this as a disrespect for knowledge, but rather an impatience for those who create things before deciding their place in this unfair, pragmatic world.",1444117722

If you sometimes have to wait a minute or even if it&#x27;s only seconds to complete some keystrokes, you get insane. Sometimes I read some research papers, but you don&#x27;t have a big desk in front of you where you can put other papers, a notebook + computer to look up other things while reading, or make notes, etc - the place is just not there. Also, it&#x27;s often very loud and other people talking constantly directly next to you. You can try with earplugs or music - but it&#x27;s just not as productive as you would be in a silent environment.<p>That is in Germany, the RE4 train from Wuppertal to Aachen and back.<p>I would move to Aachen and I will move when my girlfriend is finally finished with her education in Düsseldorf + Krefeld (again other cities...).",1444116159

They were uncomplicated chunks of metal, so it&#x27;s quite common for them to do a million miles without any significant problems. Of course they were dirty as hell, so it&#x27;s a good thing we don&#x27;t use cars like that anymore. The only legitimate use I can think of is people who go in off roaders to Africa or deep parts of siberia, where the fuel quality is absolutely horrible, so you can&#x27;t have a modern diesel with a high pressure direct injection system - one spec of dirt in your fuel and your injectors get clogged.",1444116157

10337200,comment,10336701,10336701,0,0,ddingus,,,"What I don&#x27;t like:<p><i>Filtering of comments that may be valid and important critiques of the work published as well as the publisher / online venue.  The thing I like most about the Internet is that many to many communication mode.  Basic things like fact checking and or just awareness of something not being inclusive are powerful things.  They force authors to really think hard about what they write.<p>Obviously, there is a lot of noise too, and that&#x27;s the standard excuse for strong moderation, but it&#x27;s really difficult to understand when the moderation is strong in the sense of promoting signal and demoting noise, and when it&#x27;s censorship or manipulation.<p>Frankly, I&#x27;ll take the noise because I would rather determine this myself, or at least have the data needed to make that determination.<p>Traditionally, it&#x27;s been an editorial thing.  Major news outlets have been in the position to manage questions related to their product as well as themselves and aren&#x27;t comfortable with the masses feedback.  Though the noise level was high, it was also possible to see manipulations and just general lack of accuracy or inclusive commentary and reporting too.  Net good, for those who went looking.<p>This also brought bloggers and basically anyone really interested in something on par with the majors.  One guy who really cares can make an impact and fact check the biggest of the big.  It&#x27;s important we continue to make this a reality.  We may not like it, but we need it.<p>The other bit that gets broken here is dialogs.  People just saying stuff is kind of noisy.  But where the moderation encourages dialog, that dialog can often have as much or more value than the effort being discussed does.  Of all the things I appreciate about the Internet, having conversations with people all over the world is right there at the top!  If anything, we should be finding better ways to have conversations.  Efforts like this do not do that.<p>I also suspect the strong desire to do that will see some corrective type service or norm that the conversations will move to.  Maybe back to critical blogs again?  Something else?  For sure it&#x27;s not gonna be Facebook.  At least not for me.  FB is a raging mess. Useless for this.<p>Having a large degree of free speech online means our speech does bring others speech in response.  So there will almost always be haters, but there will be validation and recommendation and augmentation in there too.  We want this.  It&#x27;s important that we don&#x27;t create a place largely filled with walled off, largely one way, broadcast type efforts no different than the already lame broadcast type, one way efforts that dominate so much media now anyway.<p>Really, I&#x27;ve sworn off most traditional media for this reason.  It&#x27;s much more informative and inclusive to seek it globally, get various perspectives and see those be critical as well as affirmative.</i><p>What I do like:<p><i>Low noise.  Maybe comments are just doomed.  In some places they aren&#x27;t, but in many they are just crappy.  Perhaps it is time to turn off comments, but what then?  I really don&#x27;t feel good about a &quot;best of&quot; type action where they pick some they feel are representative.<p>If they offer up something here, it could be meaningful.  I have no idea what that would look like though.  Here&#x27;s to hoping...<p>To a degree, discouragement of hate and or just a lot of ugly speech.  Many comment sections are filled with some vile stuff that does not add value, other than to remind us that a few too many of us do not get the basics of being a good quality human yet.</i><p>As for Sullivan, yes he did not allow comments, and I never did think much of his site for that.  Mostly, I ignored it and read through the lens of other places, who would cite him, and then critical dialog could be incorporated as part of the experience.  To me, this is vital.  It&#x27;s not that I didn&#x27;t necessarily like Sullivan.  It&#x27;s more that I saw his work as a platform for discussion, not primarily consumption.<p>I really don&#x27;t like one way productions for that reason.<p>This site is a great example.  We link to a lot of stuff that may or may not allow comments, but then we enter into what generally is a pretty great dialog.  There are lots of points of view, people adding value with other references and thoughts of various kinds, and fact checking happens fairly consistently.  Additionally, as I get to understand others here better, that dialog improves in value.  Sure, we&#x27;ve got some biases, but the dialog is constructive enough for it to work well anyway.  Very high value here, and that value comes from &quot;the hive mind&quot; where our collective responses actually augment the piece and give us food for thought about that piece.  Overall, given people actually do read and interact some, it&#x27;s a great bull shit filter as well as a path to a more inclusive perspective.<p>Maybe people don&#x27;t understand the value in that, or maybe worse, people aren&#x27;t able to, or simply do not desire that value.  I harbor hope the former is true and we can get more people there more of the time.<p>For me personally, it&#x27;s just not acceptable to read and not go seek the thoughts of others related to some material I find online.  I&#x27;ve simply lost the trust in the vast majority of cases related to media organizations.  I do continue to trust individuals and some organizations that are focused in some way or other and who do not derive primary income from publishing.<p>Vice is a cool platform, and they offer up some frank commentary and news.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed a lot of what I read there.  Maybe they can replace comments with something that works and that I can trust.  Hope so.",1444116086

Then, once I'd ""lost"" all my investment, and we were approaching outside investment, I converted to C Corp. This worked great, except for the loosing all my investment part.",1244311188
644935,comment,644855,644855,0,0,halo,,,"I think it's more likely that browsers implement the W3C geolocation API before IPv6 becomes mainstream, which will cover use-cases where accurate geolocation is important, but will require the permission by the user. I don't think we'll ever reach a point where IP geolocation is something you can rely on.",1244311002

1) Display only ""large"" pictures (1024px wide). That's what makes The Big Picture special.
2) It should work on any browsing page on Flickr. I don't want to re-enter my search criteria on another site.<p>Questions:
1) Should the script use AJAX & DOM manipulation to modify the Flickr page? Or just redirect to a page on another domain?
2) Should it ever run automatically on page load?
3) Do we need to use any Flickr authentication for the browsing user?",1244310574

644928,comment,643720,644326,0,0,iron_ball,,,"I live in Manhattan, and one thing I've noticed is that panhandlers are generally polite and unobtrusive, and other homeless nearly invisible. I'm sure that's the result of aggressive policing -- a spoken but unofficial ""don't hassle anyone and we won't find an excuse to bring you in."" Maybe the answer is to minimize the negative effects of homelessness as much as possible without attempting to ""eradicate"" it?<p>Bear in mind that obviously I only know this equation from the middle-class white-collar side; for all I know, the lives of the Manhattan homeless are no better than in cities where they could be more rambunctious.",1244310338

What do you think?",,"I wanted a way to run automated tests on Amazon's Elastic Block Storage so I could compare performance for a single instance type over time and between Linux and Solaris. I also wanted to be able to run tests manually to check for performance degradation. I've been working on an EC2 deployment tool and I realized that I could use it to automate other kinds of workflows too. This week I finally put two and two together and created a really simple test workflow for EBS volumes.<p>Here's what I came up with:
http://gist.github.com/123400<p>Right now I'm only running Bonnie64 tests and only for small and large instances of Linux. There's also no fancy reporting, just Bonnie's txt output. My plan is to add other tests and then figure out something simple for reporting (Google Charts, probably). After that I'll add Solaris and other distros / machines sizes.<p>Do you have any suggestions for other tests/benchmarks to use? What do you think about the approach?",1244310141

If his misfortune was exceptional, and the remedy a rapid return to form, then this story is reassuring; but that is not the case. Instead, his misfortune was commonplace, yet the remedy applied only to him, leaving untold others calcified in their situation.<p>In that case, his story is a meaningless aberration.",1244309961

There does not seem to be much correlation with long-term achievement (relative to other smart people who aren't prodigies). There is usually a vicariously overachieving parent or two in the picture.<p>I'm interested in the subject because, like a lot of people here, I was a mild case of it myself. Looking back, I'd say it led to early burnout. I don't think it did much good - but then, as an old professor of mine used to say, ""Life does not bear counterfactuals.""",1244309445

The textbooks are also surrounded by bureaucracy and they sound like they were written by robots. Every emotion, opinion, or different view of an event is thrown out. Math textbooks just give you a proof and some examples. Most of the time they don't give you why or how you would use it, nor the underlying proofs that were used to come to theorem or proof.",1244309082

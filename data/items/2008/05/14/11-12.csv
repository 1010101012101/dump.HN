Seems like a nice tool but they have a ridiculously anti-user trial period of ""7 Application Launches before time out"". I didn't feel that I was able to try it out enough before it timed out on me so I didn't buy it.",1210766250

Either way, you're choosing a strategy of ""Strengthen your weaknesses."" There are other strategies like ""Play to your strengths"" that a lot of people will advocate very strongly. Personally I cannot think to advocate one and only one strategy; I think you have to fit with the dynamics at hand and go with the optimal strategy at the moment.",1210765374

189456,comment,189438,189445,0,0,melvinram,,,"Kevin, I hear your concerns. However, if you take a closer look, you'll find this is not what you think it is. In any case, thanks for responding. ~ mel<p>>> Definitely a nice try, your enthusiasm is appreciated but this is the wrong audience for your widget.<p>I couldn't disagree more. Ponder Pearls has a content library that is very useful for the HN community, many of whom I've noticed are entrepreneurs like myself. Sales & success tips from Brian Tracy can be valuable in closing deals. Positive thoughts from successful innovators can help motivate someone who might be going through a bit of a financial roller coaster in launching their startup. I could go on and on.<p>>> My home page is about:blank, I imagine this, custom pages, and netvibes/google are the popular homepages and I can't see why anyone would switch to your thing.<p>Blank home pages work for some people. I personally used to use Google.com. I switched because you can't really get a lot of the positive content such as sales & success tips from Brian Tracy's book, quotes from The Peaceful Warrior, etc. This is like iGoogle/Netvibes/etc without ADD. It offers small bits of wisdom from some very positive people.<p>>> Honestly I suspect you've been ripped off. The idea of a mediocre homepage being seen as a gift just seems incredibly fake to me and would only work on very computer unsavvy people.<p>A lot of my clients use this and they like it. I figured you all would like it too. Take a quick peak. If you don't like it, no biggie. Just offering a gift which I think you'll find valuable. Chances are you'll love it if you try it.<p>>> You're paying money to promote someone else's widget? Are you doing this just for pagerank? Or do you get a cut of the advertising money?<p>There are no ads on the site or the desktop version. I pay for this so I can do something nice for my clients and stay in front of them in a positive way. My clients get positive thoughts. I get their loyalty. Ponder Pearls gets money from me. Win-win-win.<p>Think of it this way, it's like getting daily coaching from wise people.<p>Why am I ""promoting"" it on HN? I like the community. I hope it's not too hard to believe? lol No hidden agenda Kevin, promise. Anyway, I'm going to go knock out. It's 4am here in Cali.",1210762920

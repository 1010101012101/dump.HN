In the long term, the advertising revenues from NBC and Fox's online video should be very respectable.<p>As long as the shows are free to watch, it won't be a disastrous failure because there aren't many places to easily and legally watch online network TV. The best way to compete with piracy is to give your media away. If they insist on charging for everything, it'll fail.",1186738685

Importantly its free and has a usable and friendlier license than MySQL. <p>I am working on a startup idea which will also have high traffic and I am personally using Schevo - which is a non-sql Object DBMS for python based on Durus. I like Schevo because SQL sucks and using Schevo is like you a programming language - in this case its Python. You can check out the Schevo project at www.schevo.org. This would work for you only if you are using Python (highly recommend). Schevo does not have very good documentation yet, but it has excellent support on the IRC and Google Groups from its creators - at least I have found them to give complete and quick responses.Hope this helps.",1186737008

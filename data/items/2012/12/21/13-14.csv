Telling people that they're all stupid sheep for using Google isn't going to get much traction. We need to highlight real problems, like this move by Instagram.<p>Lots of us also work on open source software, in which case telling people not to trust anything that's free is shooting ourselves in the foot.

4952653,comment,4947439,4948489,1,0,RTigger,,,"Fair enough - I haven't actually used a hypermedia API (short of OData). I really can't see the documenting point though. Sure, you get a list of actions that you can perform, but you get those in a response object.  Some people compare this to ""intellisense documentation"", but really it's more like having to decompile the library to figure out what's going on.  You have to do something extra in order to figure out what the next step is, rather than just having it available.  Also, I'm pretty sure any API that is currently ""discoverable"" probably also has a full suite of documentation.  Why do the same thing twice?<p>Not sure about other languages, but most of the client apps I make don't use hardcoded urls - they use a base API url, and then modifications for specific resources.  The RestSharp library for C# is a great example of how this works, and even in javascript it's not hard to refactor things so they use a base url and append path & parameters based on the models you're working with.<p>I'm not arguing the simplicity of it, although it would be more simple to implement if we agreed on a standard like in the original article.  I'm just arguing the value.",1356098050

So I would say Swedish is the easiest language ever - especially if you know both German and English since almost all swedish vocab seems to be related to either one or the other.<p>Another really easy language for English speakers that's not on this list would be Chinese, its complete lack of any grammer makes it pathetically simple also the fact that you don't even nead to learn an alphabet to read in Chinese is a big plus.

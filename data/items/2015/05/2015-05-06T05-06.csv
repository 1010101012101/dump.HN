It is a lightweight Trello-like dashboard with just a bit more functionality than Trello has.<p>We&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and looks like it&#x27;s exactly what we need. Previously we used JIRA, but it would be more precisely to say we made several approaches to start using JIRA, and every time after sing it for 1-2 weeks we slowly ceased. It looked too heavy for our small company and our environment, no one wanted to deal with it.<p>Now with Breeze.pm we have project dashboards, some integrations with HipChat, Github, Slack. Notifications, calendar, groups of projects, search and filters - and a nice and responsive UI attached. We also like the developer of Breeze who is open for questions and suggestions.",1430891999

I have plenty of game design experience; last weekend I stumbled into a hackathon where I ended up giving an early-stage founder some ideas to radically improve an experience that everyone agrees sucks right now(consumer medicine). Based on that data point there&#x27;s plenty of room to make this work, above and beyond the existing gamification tropes of putting badges and rewards on things. (Badges are an easy sell, but in essence, it was already there - recall &quot;employee of the month&quot; or &quot;reward coupons.&quot;)<p>My pitch would be to make play - not just &quot;fun&quot; or compulsion loops, but the whole dynamic of playful activity - an organizational improvement process. The best results, as with most things, would need deep structural commitment, but there would be room even for a limited engagement to make some progress.",1430891932

9496795,comment,9492893,9493791,0,0,tehchromic,,,"i suppose, but this perspective also comes with its own anthro-centric assumptions.<p>For example, the assumption that we are the most intelligent creature to have yet emerged from the evolutionary process is most certainly a function of how one measures &quot;intelligence&quot;. it might be the case that one can measure intelligence through the fossil record, but i would be interested to see a study of the selective pressure that produces advanced and intricate central nervous systems, and to understand how this could be said to increase in overall terms. i think it might not be the case, although it might, given certain selective conditions. i&#x27;m not sure we know what those are.<p>To me, the definition of intelligence is to produce the most appropriate response given the circumstances. So a plant that turns its leaves towards the sun is displaying intelligence. are plants more intelligent than we? by some measures yes - being able to respond to direct sunlight by producing energy is certainly appropriate in some circumstances - plants have solved a problem that we cannot, and therefore are more intelligent than we. (and i know folks will reject the idea that photosynthesis is a form of intelligence, but in my opinion that&#x27;s anthro-centrism!)<p>is pondering the orbits of distant planets the most intelligent activity to have been performed by any organism ever? is building mega-cities and particle colliders? We don&#x27;t know yet. it could be extremely inappropriate, because it could be next to impossible to travel between stars, given the reality of our existence. we could be leading ourselves to our own extinction, by dramatically altering our own planetary biosphere and chemistry, in pursuit of lofty visions such as interstellar travel. That&#x27;s not so intelligent.<p>Another relevant point is that we don&#x27;t have very much of the fossil record. i read somewhere that we had like 4% or so, although i am not exactly sure how one estimates that percentage. But assuming so, somewhere in that 96% there could be critters more freakishly intelligent that we.<p>suppose that in the 4-5 billion years of life on earth, of which our own record of relatively extreme intelligence is only 2,000 years old, there could in fact have been civilizations created by social creatures with as much or more intelligence than we. There could have been cities, perhaps in the millions and millions of years when dinosaurs were common. Granted this goes against commonly held assumptions, but it is certainly not impossible.<p>Keep in mind, a mere 150 years ago, we had a global civilization that could have vanished easily without a trace in 20,000 years, let alone 1 million. do we think of ourselves as incredibly more intelligent than our great grandparents, or theirs, or than people living 300 years ago? Better informed on certain topics for sure, but more intelligent? We are more like plants now, in that our intelligence is specialized to certain techno-powerful purposed, of which the intelligence relative to our external conditions is still yet to be decided. We might say that our ancestors were more intelligent for avoiding the kinds of environmental and social disasters that we have engendered.<p>Anyway, were we to go extinct now, we assume that future intelligent creatures would find remains of our great civilization. But we don&#x27;t know how long these would last. There&#x27;s some luck involved. it&#x27;s possible that the hominid layer could degrade quickly!<p>On the other hand, if common assumption is correct and we really are the only potentially starfaring organisms to have evolved yet, then that argues my original point that life, and life worth communicating with, could be exceedingly rare. in 4 billion years (about 1/4th to 1/3rd of the age of the universe) life sufficiently intelligent to travel the stars has only emerged once. Those odds seem low, but they might be freakishly, abysmally low as well. Had it emerged twice, and we had some evidnce, odds would be better, but once! That&#x27;s hard to quantify, especially as the longer life persists, the more likely it is to be wiped out by some kind of extinction event.",1430891495

After having a heart to heart with David, I don’t think that’s true. David rightly pointed out to me that he and Chrys worked extremely hard. They built something that captured the imagination of a lot of people and had a huge amount of users. The tone and content of my comments as printed don’t pay the appropriate respect to that fact.<p>As a fund, one thing remains true — we are not excited about founders selling stock early in a company’s life cycle. It provokes the question — if founder’s are sellers, why would we or others be buyers.<p>As for it not being “sustainable,” there is no way to ascribe that to the founders any more than the million other reasons a start up can fail. This one did. But credit to the founders for not just running out the clock and spending all the money — and instead returning some capital to investors rather than running it into the ground. That takes bravery. It doesn’t happen often.<p>As I now understand, David is doing a lot to make it as right as he can with his investors and employees.

9496708,comment,9494786,9496080,0,0,colin_mccabe,,,"In the 1950s, nobody would have believed that &quot;genetic drift&quot; happened at all.  The reason was because back then, the thinking was that any genetic change must be adaptive and caused by natural selection.  The accumulation of &quot;neutral&quot; changes-- genetic drift-- was very controversial when it was first proposed, and wasn&#x27;t really widely accepted until at least the 1980s or 1990s.<p>This main thrust of this paper seems to be the idea that genetic drift is the primary driver of speciation (the process of creating new species.)  The paper also makes claims about a &quot;speciation clock&quot; that seems to tick every 2 million years, for many different species.<p>These two claims seem somewhat at odds.  Presumably genetic drift will happen more rapidly in species like fruit flies or beetles that have short generation times.  Genetic drift should be slow in species like whales since they take so long to reproduce, and drift can&#x27;t happen except during reproduction.  So if species are splitting off every 2 million years for both whales and fruit flies, that suggests genetic drift can&#x27;t be the only factor, since it&#x27;s 1000x faster (or more) in fruit flies as in whales.  Anyway, I didn&#x27;t read the paper that closely, so maybe I&#x27;m missing something.<p>In general, speciation is a complicated and poorly understood topic with a lot of controversies remaining.  For example, is it more common for a species to split into two because of a physical obstruction (body of water, mountain range, etc.), or because different sub-populations start occupying different ecological niches due to slightly different environments, and gradually grow more distinct?  (allopatric speciation versus parapatric speciation).  It&#x27;s hard to actually measure how much mixing there was between populations millions of years ago, so this is still controversial.  And parapatric speciation gives more weight to natural selection so it used to be the preferred explanation.  But this is far from a settled debate.",1430889293

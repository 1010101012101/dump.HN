I have yet to even hear of a good setup for <i>measuring</i> X or Y, to say nothing of actual <i>numbers</i> for them, for measuring ""probability of success in a startup"".  Heck, I have never even heard a defensible universalizable definition of <i>success</i> for a startup.<p>Incidentally, and this has always bothered me about statements like ""give your X the highest probability of Y"": do people routinely get the opportunity to run a simple random sample of startups, marry a simple random sample of women, raise a simple random sample of children, etc?  No?  Then why do we bastardize statistics in this manner.",1237179466

I haven't posted a single tweet, so no one has any valid reason to follow me, except to try to gain more followers.<p>I suspect many of them will unfollow me shortly, after they realize I won't follow them back. I'm saving all the ""new follower"" emails I get from Twitter, and in another day or so I'll compare them to my remaining followers to see who's guilty.<p>The vast majority of the unsolicited followers are people peddling some sort of bullshit get-rich-quick MLM scheme.",1237178721

But being a Facebook friend, up until now, has been much more than seeing occasional newsfeed updates. I've never said ""I'll be friends with this person so I'll see their stati,"" it's always, ""I'll be friends so that they can invite me to parties and write on my wall.""<p>Over the last couple days, I've been frantically hiding newsfeed updates from people that I don't care about.<p>Twitter has the advantage over Facebook in that really the only reason to follow someone is to get their tweets.

So, I picked up a topic I could write an ebook on 'How to Start An Online Business'\n<a href=""http://paraschopra.com/business/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paraschopra.com/business/</a><p>First I tried launching it as a premium ebook, priced at $65 with some 6-7 pages long copy (see the source code of the page, the long copy is still there)<p>I didn't sell even a single copy. (Though I must admit, the traffic was really low, not even 5-6 visitors per day as I didn't do Adwords)<p>Then I dropped the price to $5, and did a short copy of the sales letter. Still nothing happened.<p>Now I am offering the ebook as free download and I get 2-3 downloads per day thanks to Google First Page Result for the term 'How to Start an Online Business'. Nothing sells like free stuff!<p>Maybe it was the ebook or maybe it was the sales letter or maybe it was both, but the fact is that I didn't sell even a single copy.

That seems really sane to me - capital seems like a magnifier for a process that either produces money or consumes money.

517737,comment,517053,517444,0,0,patio11,,,"Little known fact: some Catholic priests are permitted to marry.<p>Theology, like programming, has edge cases.  Here's an example: you're an Anglican.  Anglicans have apostolic succession -- i.e. if you're a priest, you were admitted by a bishop, who was in turn once a priest admitted by a bishop, who was in turn ... by St. Peter who was chosen to lead the Church by Christ Himself.  Despite the fact that Anglicans are not Catholics, and do things differently (such as permitting priests to marry), under Catholic theology their claim to holy orders is good if a little misguided.<p>But what if one who is married converts to Catholicism?  They're still a priest until they forsake it.  Their marriage was licit when they entered into it.  We're famously touchy about dissolving marriages -- either it was illicit when it was entered into (perhaps due to reasons that were not discovered yet) and thus requiring an annulment, or its good and binding until death.<p>Which means married Anglican priests who convert to Catholicism (slightly more complicated -- you need the bishop to sign off on it) are now married Catholic priests.",1237177207

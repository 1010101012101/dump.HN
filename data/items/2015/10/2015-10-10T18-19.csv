10366537,story,,,2,0,Det_Jacobian,"Ask HN: Will a Kickstarter hurt my game's messaging?",,"This week the video game I&#x27;ve been sweating over for 2 years ran a pretty successful reveal campaign:<p>Press mentions: https://www.google.com/#q=astroneer
Site: http://astroneer.space
Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv7xbHkLdGw<p>We&#x27;re now in a place, having proven to ourselves that we have an (unfinished) game
that people want, that we need a small amount (roughly 100K) to be able to ship in March as a Steam Early Access title.  We&#x27;d like to bring on at our two remaining team members as full timers, to add to our existing three who can otherwise survive (with very tight belts) until our Early Access ship date.  Without the money, we will still ship, but it will be a lower quality game and take a bigger stress toll on us.<p>The question is, the money raised from a KS aside, how will doing a crowdfunding campaign affect the game&#x27;s messaging in the long run?  We may have an issue where people don&#x27;t expect a game that plans on Early Access to also do a Kickstarter.  But a Kickstarter would in fact make it easier for us to put out a good game, and would save us from the clutches of publishers.  What do do?",1444503527

(EDIT: Okay, news.ycombinator.com also does it well with its inline job ads. See, I didn&#x27;t even think of it as an ad, that&#x27;s how nicely it&#x27;s embedded.) The problem is that people used to use the internet to exchange files and information that was then locally stored on each PC. Now, you go to youtube, listen to a song, and 20 minutes later you download the entire video again if you listen to it (if you closed the tab inbetween). That stuff adds up and of course everyone is reluctant to pay that bill. The solution is going back to a decentralized download-culture like it was in the 90&#x27;s.

Welcome to the real world where school... is pretty useless and every graduate is now starting off on an even playing field. :P<p>> I know C, JavaScript, PHP and little bit of Python from some personal projects I did for personal purposes.<p>- Master at least 1 language, and be average on the rest.<p>- Master at least 2 frameworks from any of them, one stable and one that&#x27;s more recent.<p>- Contribute to open-source projects. It&#x27;s contribution for the others, and more learning for you.<p>- Go beyond the norms. For instance, build your blog using a static site generator instead of WordPress. Or program a robot in PHP.<p>- Write a blog about your programming adventures, what you learned, what you discovered.<p>- Complement your blog with Twitter. Share your posts, put hashtags.<p>- Be present in online communities. Aside from contributing to open-source, you can turn to StackOverflow or Quora.<p>- Put those personal projects in a public repository like Github (remove personally info like passwords, PINS, API keys etc.)<p>- Get a microcontroller, preferably programmed with C, create something, share it online. It&#x27;s good for online exposure.<p>> all jobs I see requires previous work experience<p>Don&#x27;t let job postings scare you. Some companies will just use that cover to scare off those who aren&#x27;t daring enough to try, as well as those people who are just academics-minded and don&#x27;t know how to bust open from their shells. I tried out for a job once, just for laughs, while my friends were legitimately looking for jobs. Out of all of us, I was the one accepted. I wasn&#x27;t even qualified based on their requirements. Heck! I didn&#x27;t even finish college yet while my friends all did!<p>What I mentioned above will set you aside from the rest of the herd of graduates looking for jobs.<p>> Even with the bad salary I want to enter the labor market<p>Work for startups in the local community, even for part time. They usually pay low, but you get to meet meet people and learn from them. Hype powers startups, and piggybacking on it can take you to places. You get to meet other programmers from the community, share ideas, improve your skills. You get to know the bigwigs running the companies. Just knowing people can get you around in the community. Know enough and be known enough, you could host local meetups.<p>Do note that working for a startup can burn you out. Don&#x27;t overwork, but still get stuff done. Negotiate your work hours, work when you feel most productive. Don&#x27;t sacrifice your last year in school because you got overworked.<p>---<p>Everything will take time, about a few months to a year. I suggest you get started now.

10366487,comment,10354181,10355711,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"You&#x27;re right on whether University shouldn&#x27;t show classified information: that&#x27;s technically the law. The rest not so much.<p>Let me stop you right at legality. According to classification law, the act of classification may never be used to cover up illegal activities or merely embarrassing information by agencies under executive branch. The black programs started under the Bush/Cheney administration were so illegal that they had dedicated cronies to try to write BS justifications for them and relied on secret interpretations of law not existing in any public court. Leaking them isn&#x27;t just ethical: it&#x27;s legal or in a grey area of legal. Further, there were other unlawful programs such as BULLRUN where organizations that were supposed to protect government systems were weakening everything they depended on. If we ever get a &quot;cyber-9/11,&quot; there&#x27;s a good chance the NSA&#x27;s programs will be responsible for it due to the holes they leave in for the enemies to find and exploit. Not to mention preventing critical infrastructure from benefiting from high assurance protection like GOTS guards, Type 1 crypto, etc. Any patriot seeing an intelligence agency aiding the enemy and attacking Americans should definitely leak that information before betraying the oath they swore.<p>Now, far as secrecy laws, we have three options: follow strict rules passed by dirty Congress a long time ago; try to release whatever is justifiable through freedom of press (hear of that law?); try to fight it in court with jury nullification of abusive aspects of classification to set precedents. Congress is still dirty: beholden to national security organizations, esp with stock options & contracts. So I left them out. Voters are apathetic & hard to reach individually. That leaves two options for anyone seeing something that straight up shouldn&#x27;t be classified or deserves a public debate. Which is the choice of the person and how much risk he or she wants to take. Neither is more ethical than the other as the real ethical failure is the lack of integrity by lawmakers and executive branch with punishments for people that show it.<p>&quot;This guy disclosed information he literally had no right to disclose&quot;<p>He has several rights that cover it. In the First, speech and press are the obvious ones. A protest also requires ability to name the wrong. Many religions also forbid doing evil to others, esp unjustified (eg bulk). The Third is violated by botnets & C&C nodes. The Fourth is routinely violated by TAO without a court order. The Fifth is undermined by NSA collecting private communications and sabotaging crypto. Parallel construction, also in leaks, skirts the Sixth and Seventh in so many ways it&#x27;s not funny. The Nineth&#x27;s right to privacy interpretations are ignored. State&#x27;s versions of the same under Tenth are ignored. Then there&#x27;s law I referenced against classifying wrongdoing and Federal/State laws that encourage whistleblowing on it.<p>So, there&#x27;s all kinds of <i>rights</i> and <i>laws</i> supporting disclosure of illegal or unethical information despite it being classified. You suggesting we should throw them all out to support arbitrary locking of information in black boxes? Or maybe throw <i>that</i> out when it doesn&#x27;t make sense?<p>Note: Another thing I find strange in your side&#x27;s position is how the decision to classify something can be one person&#x27;s discretion but no discretion is allowed in whistleblowing or declassifying it. Kind of nonsense position from the start, eh? Gets dumber when we add a conflict of interest for the organization that commits wrongdoing, classifies it, and (as the &quot;owner&quot;) is the one you expect to... properly declassify that? Lol. My interpretation and strategy sound more honest as they can avoid non-punishable leaks by drawing a line between legit and corrupt practices.",1444502649

Several threads here have commented on our tooling and processes around index changes. I can give a bit more detail about how that works.<p>We have a library that allows us to describe expected schemas and expected indexes in application code. When application developers add or remove expected indexes in application code, an automated task turns these into alerts to database operators to run pre-defined tools that handle index operations.<p>In this situation, an application developer didn&#x27;t add a new index description or remove an index description, but rather modified an existing index description. Our automated tooling erroneously handled this particular change and interpreted it not as a single intention but instead encoded it as two separate operations (an addition and a removal).<p>Developers describe indices directly in the relevant application/model code to ensure we always have the right indices available -- and in part to help avoid situations like this. In addition, the tooling for adding and removing indexes in production is restricted to a smaller set of people, both for security and to provide an additional layer of review (also to help prevent situations like this). Unfortunately, because of the bug above, the intent was not accurately communicated. The operator saw two operations, not obviously linked to each other, among several other alerts, and, well, the result followed.<p>There are some pretty obvious areas for tooling and process improvements here. We&#x27;ve been investigating them over the last few days. For non-urgent remediations, we have a custom of waiting at least a week after an incident before conducting a full postmortem and determining remediations. This gives us time to cool down after an incident and think clearly about our remediations for the long-term. We&#x27;ll be having these in-depth discussions, and making decisions about the future of our tooling and processes, over the next week.",1444502307

Example: The old card catalog is a tiny space through which you can move relatively quickly so that you don&#x27;t have to explore parts of the library through which you can only move relatively slowly.<p>Mathematics is an indexing system for ideals (it maps ideals onto ideals).  It&#x27;s unreasonably effective for a couple of reasons:<p>* Some ideals correspond close enough to reality to be useful. So, mathematics indexes reality.<p>* Since mathematics indexes ideals, it can index itself. In other words, no matter how big mathematics gets, you can always shrink it again by using more math.<p>The purpose  of encapsulation is to hide, but the purpose of indexing is to reveal. Mathematics does the opposite of encapsulation.<p>> In programming, the core abstraction mechanism is the function, which is essentially a device for &quot;encapsulating internal complexity&quot;<p>Abstraction is not about hiding complexity, abstraction is just naming things. I think what you really mean to say is that the core abstraction in programming is substitution: We give names to substitutions.

We have at least one big existence proof that this works at scale.<p>But, even in the mathematical sense, OOP with immutability offers more than just partial function application; it yields families of algebras, and we&#x27;re always inventing/discovering new varieties of those. On the other hand, if you use just a little bit of mutable state judiciously, you get a set of propositions that are falsifiable by experiment: In other words, you get science, which was one of the motives for inventing OOP.",1444501130

Not putting you down, it would be just as impossible for me to have a valid opinion about anything going on in Norway because I am completely ignorant of your laws and environment.<p>I am not disputing these problems are in a range from less-than-ideal to horrible.  However, the term often used in product design &quot;form follows function&quot; might be applicable here.<p>For example, our police force&#x27;s &quot;form&quot; is a result of the &quot;function&quot; they have to serve, which includes a country with 300 million guns, higher crime rate than a lot of countries and, currently, a situation where segments of the population are advocating killing cops.  And, in fact, cops have been killed just sitting in their cars doing absolutely nothing more than existing.<p>Again, not proposing this is the police force I want.  Yet one has to understand things in context before forming an opinion.  I know lots of cops.  I train at a local Aikido dojo that is run by a retired FBI agent.  Probably 80% of the students are in law enforcement (police, CHP, correctional, anti-terrorist units, FBI and undisclosed).  A number of them are friends.  We go have lunch and dinner together and talk about these things.  They are very concerned that every time they put on their uniform they become targets for maniacs.  They&#x27;d love to be able to walk around without their guns when in uniform but, today, in the USA, that would be suicidal.  And today, in the USA, for a cop to approach contact with a civilian not prepared for the potential of a gun being pointed at them would be just as dangerous.<p>That, BTW, is one of the problems we have today in this country.  Nobody talks to anyone in an effort to understand what&#x27;s going on yet everyone has an opinion.  Sit down with a cop for a two or three hour heart-to-heart conversation and your view of their reality will be very different.  Don&#x27;t think of them as an image on TV.  Think of them as your brother, sister, father or mother.<p>The sick and the poor?  That&#x27;s an entirely different problem.  Again, go through the mental exercise of developing a solution --a realistic one-- before forming opinions.  You can&#x27;t just say &quot;do it like Norway&quot; or &quot;do it like France&quot;, because we are not Norway or France.  We have our own laws, problems, culture and dynamics.  And so, the solutions have to be had in the context of an entire society.<p>In my opinion the USA is going through some of the phases Latin America has gone through in terms of what&#x27;s happening with government and the poor.  In order to understand what I mean you have to understand Latin American history going back to 1492 and probably a bit before that.  I am not going to go into the details, there&#x27;s an excellent set of videos that paint a strong evidence-based image of the problem.  If you don&#x27;t speak Spanish you can turn on subtitles and google translate (not a great translation but it might do).  Here they are:<p>Short one: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkYEXS16dZA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkYEXS16dZA</a><p>In depth: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WylR8EvhnE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WylR8EvhnE</a><p>There are a couple of lines in these videos that hit the &quot;poor&quot; problem in the US right on the head.  Please remember the context here is Latin American history, not US.  I am simply proposing there are important parallels (not a match, parallels):<p>&quot;Populism: It&#x27;s the shortcut through which politicians play with people&#x27;s passions, dreams and ideals to promise them the impossible, taking advantage of the people making decisions outside the bounds of logic and reason as they focus in their misery.  It plays with necessities of the population to impose a dictatorship.&quot;<p>&quot;Populism has such love for the poor that it multiplies them.&quot;<p>The latter one is particularly powerful.  When politicians play the people for their own benefit nothing good can come from that.  I feel very strongly that the Latin American historical experience is a time machine for aspects of the US experience.  They are probably fifty years ahead of us in populism and it&#x27;s effects.<p>A populist uses the population for votes during elections yet needs them to stay poor and miserable after winning the election or they lose their &quot;base&quot;.  They do this by promising to fix their problems and, ultimately, not doing anything for them.  The poor staying poor is good for the populist. They appease them with gifts that might feel good but do not, ultimately, solve the real problems.  YouTube is full of videos going back to 2008 with people in absolutely rapture about the Obama era solving all their problems.  Obama promised the parting of the oceans and beyond and, of course, just like any good populist, delivered almost nothing.  The poor are still poor, the uneducated are still uneducated and we have worst problems than we had seven years ago.<p>And so I ask, before forming an opinion about anything --not just the US, anything in your life-- take the time to really understand it from the inside and develop solutions on paper.  Opinions without solid context and deep solution analysis aren&#x27;t very valuable.<p>BTW, we are all guilty of this. Most of use react to things rather than taking the more difficult road of investing time and mental effort to dig deep into something before shaping an opinion.  People will, for example, down vote this post without investing the four hours, or more, that it would take to research and truly understand.  Nobody is going to go to the local police station and engage a cop in a conversation to understand what being a cop feels like.  And nobody is going to devote a couple of hours to watch those videos and another two or more hours to research what they learned and develop context.  That&#x27;s just the way things are.  Again, we are --me included-- all guilty of this, which is part of the problem.",1444500491

And, it doesn&#x27;t need to ever completely replace other currencies to be disruptive and useful.  I think the same kind of design principles could be applied to the general problem of communications.<p>We CAN build what we need, in fact most of what we need exists in software bits and bobs already.<p>Connectivity to this alternative network I envision would be free, but users would need to pay local trusted individuals/businesses to aggregate and cache subscriptions to wider-area feeds for them.  Consider that these feeds would necessarily constitute large amounts of data since you&#x27;d need to bring huge swaths of data you&#x27;re interested in close to your locality.<p>The volume and freshness of the data users would subscribe to would be proportionate to how much they&#x27;d collectively be willing to pay to fetch and store on an ongoing basis (sortof like how we have tiers for internet connection speeds today.)<p>The software for the network would build on existing tools and libraries on the client with proper sandboxing of sessions.  The storage, cache, feed management, payments, chargebacks, and crypto are all solved problems for the most part.<p>Yes, this would be a huge effort and would probably work best if some new consumer hardware were developed and that would require investment.  But, I don&#x27;t think anything I have in mind is technically infeasible.  I&#x27;d like to have some reasonable systems and protocols in place that prevent users being identified and tracked on the network for most classes of communications.",1444500276

It doesn&#x27;t matter if you (or I) feel it is inadvisable to carry cash, it isn&#x27;t illegal.  Smoking pot (illegal in most places) before flying is obviously not the brightest idea given the enhanced level of security at an airport.   So I am ok with the &quot;smell&quot; prompting some extra questions (even an agreed to search) but not the seizure of personal property when nothing can tie that property to a crime.<p>Also, don&#x27;t forget, here in the US many people cannot qualify for a simple checking/savings account at a bank, meaning they use check cashing services to cash their paychecks and only have cash.  There is absolutely nothing is illegal about them only having cash. If anything IMO it is immoral that these people are iced out of the banking environment because of past credit mistakes etc. Immigrants and minorities are almost always the worst affected, how is that right?<p>Civil asset forfeiture is horrid and needs to be done away with permanently and nationally.  If you want to take someones property prove it was involved in a crime and directly contributed to or tied to the criminal act.  If the property is properly seized through the courts, the proceeds should first benefit anyone directly afflicted by the criminal act, then secondarily pay for the court and legal fees to reduce taxpayer obligations.",1444500235

While it may or may not be supported widely enough for production yet, it provides for things like &quot;server push&quot;, which should allow you to minimize network round trips while keeping components separately cacheable (and therefore not requiring you to do gymnastics with your API to keep your cache granularity down), which should be helpful both with and without GraphQL. I would recommend, either way, though, thinking about organizing your objects around how quickly they spoil for their given cache key (usually the URL) across multiple clients, since that ultimately determines where you can hit cache and where you need to make a new request, regardless of what libraries you&#x27;re using.",1444500162

It may had gone really bad in a few major cities a few times, but it&#x27;s not something everyone gets to experience. The overall air quality is not top notch but it&#x27;s also not so bad as many of the Americans think. There are many things I hate about China but air pollution won&#x27;t even be in the list.<p>Comparing to that I&#x27;m bothered a lot more here about the prevalence of guns, drugs, high crime rates, the unfairness in education (how many ivy league students come from poor families?), ridiculously expensive medical system, so many bullshit in the law, government wasting so much money while getting almost nothing done... I&#x27;d happily trade air pollution with solution to any of these problems.

This would internally be an orchestration layer providing the filtering of properties as well as the composition of resources, and of course the instructions to that layer would be GraphQL queries. This would allow internally cacheable resources (perhaps via ESIs) and the filter would be applied in front of the cache layer.<p>I&#x27;m not yet at the point where I think GraphQL replaces REST, instead it complements it.",1444500077

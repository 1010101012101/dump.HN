3982036,comment,3981562,3981562,2,0,roel_v,,,"I wonder if part of the reason is that on shorter trial periods, people are still in the 'honeymoon phase'. When you make a good first impression, people will go 'oh this is the best thing ever'. Nothing ever is, of course, and it takes a while (weeks to months, depending on the product) to find out that some aspects aren't that great. But when you've made the first payment, you've committed yourself, and now you're prone to confirmation bias.<p>After 2 months, people are more likely to have hit the not-so-great parts and may think 'meh, I'm going to try other options first'. The shorter the trail period, the more people (at least of those who actively try at all) will still be in the honeymoon phase and more likely to sign up.<p>Just thinking out loud, I have no numbers to back this up, and I wonder how one could measure this. I guess you'd need to correlate user activity to the duration of the trial and the likelihood that somebody signs up - maybe there is an overarching trend to be found there somewhere. It would require a fairly homogeneous set of users though, or otherwise a large number of users and additional data (either user traits or usage pattern commonalities) to slice the users into more homogenous groups.",1337176732

I think the real lesson of all these predecessors such as AOL is that you can't put a wall around the garden in the first place.  You can say you have, but that would be putting your mouth in a place your money shouldn't follow.<p>People thought nobody would leave the AOL because of network effects - if all your friends are there, and your Internet social life is centered there, then that would create a barrier to exit.  What it seems to really create is something more like the effect that happens in real-life social gatherings: For a while people may stay, but only because of social pressure.  They're actually ready to leave, they're just waiting for a cue that causes them to be comfortable with leaving.  That usually comes in the form of someone else finally deciding to go.  That triggers a chain reaction so that all of a sudden, a party that seemed to be still going strong empties out all at once and without much warning.<p>A lot like the WeLL, AOL, MySpace, etc.",1337176674

Lights might be annoying, but it's also seriously nerve wrecking for all involved when dealing with a pedestrian crossing without lights. As a pedestrian trying to cross, it's often difficult to judge the driver's intent, even if they are slowing down, so I'll end up staying off to the side until they stop completely. Needless to say, that's hilariously inefficient.<p>And when it gets dark, it just gets worse.

Their value to technology in general goes down if people can claim copyright infringement if someone else implements the same API. And that is, I think, the true test for what should and should not be legal: how will this impact society? I think that being able to copyright an API is a clear harm to society.<p>My difficulty comes from the fact that designing a good API is <i>hard</i>, and I think that there clearly are creative aspects to it. Doing a good job requires having an intimate knowledge of the component being interfaced with, and how programmers are likely to use it. The mere fact that we have said before ""This API sucks"" implies that it is not just a mechanical process.<p>Basically, I want one result because I feel it's better for society.

Those audiences have limited bandwidth to begin with.  The ""under law"" constraint largely drives which reasonings and facts will be most important -- especially as all that must cross a barrier of evidentiary rules and trial procedure.  The ability to weave all of that into a coherent narrative is crucial to communicating to the audience.<p>Boies can grab enough of the subject matter to speak to the key legal issues, and to ask experts the questions that define the boundaries around those questions.  Another lawyer might know more of the subject matter, but that won't matter if they can't translate that extra knowledge into legal strategy.<p>Remember also that while you might be able to find legally pertinent technical responses to Boies' work in court, you're reacting to that after hearing his strategy.  Good trial communication requires telling a unified narrative -- if your story doesn't already provide a basis for your response, that response will be weaker and may even distract from the story you do have.

The trouble is, I don't know which half."" There is a huge business opportunity in further refinements in measuring the success or failure of advertising efforts.<p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/7138905"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/node/7138905</a><p>Part of the difficulty in measuring success or failure of advertising efforts, of course, is that different businesses gain different forms of utility from successful advertising, with some businesses structured to gain from almost any increase in reputation, and others depending on prompting direct contacts with salespersons, and others desiring to increase direct, in-store customer visits. Each business client of an advertising campaign in a free enterprise economy should be allowed to define ""success"" in a way that is meaningful to that business, and each thoughtfully managed business will shop around for the advertising provider that best delivers success meaningful to the client.<p>And of course providers of advertising compete with one another by offering reasonable targeting solutions at reasonable cost. From the submitted article: ""Their first idea was to target the friends of people who already liked Pizza Delicious on Facebook. But that wound up targeting 74 percent of people in New Orleans on Facebook  224,000 people. They needed something narrower."" The clear implication here is that the restaurant could have reached the same huge number of people living in New Orleans through some other channel for less money.",1337174671

Once the card is swipped their is no need to do it ever again. Both parties are registered on the app and thus the ""mobile wallet"" has been created.

They don't target people who like Pizza. 15,440 people in New Orleans have liked Pizza on Facebook.<p>2. They don't target people who like other Pizza Outlets. Or other local restaurants. If a resident likes one local outlet, he is more prone to like other local establishments too.<p>3. They disregard targeting friends of people who already like Pizza Delicious. And by doing so - they don't use the most powerful feature Facebook has to offer: social proof.<p>4. That they do any kind of targeting beyond geographic targeting at all is probably erroneous for their type of business. Seriously - if they were running ads offline, would they run an ad in a magazine about Italy? Or would they run it in their daily local newspaper?  Pizza is something that has a wide interest. There is no need to restrict based on any kinds of interest.<p>5. There is no benefit in Liking Pizza Delicious on Facebook. No special Facebook offers. Or discount coupons. And yet they were expecting people to like their page and come visit their place right away. Their call to action is weak. You can't expect facebook likes to convert into orders straight away - when you don't even ask for an order.<p>6. Their measurement method is very inaccurate. Asking people where they found out about you has been proven to be very very inaccurate. Instead, give them a coupon and track based on that.<p>7. There was a total mismatch with their online and offline metrics. Do you ever like a page on facebook without knowing about that brand from before? Yet, they are tracking the number of Likes online.

You can do so in the city as well, by installing expensive street features that have huge downsides in snowy climates. But, many of the arguments used by the advocate in the story are bunk.<p>An example re: Pedestrian accidents: ""People think traffic lights are a guarantee of safety but the latest audit from Westminster City Council, for example, has shown that 44% of personal injury accidents occurred at traffic lights.""<p>Sure. Pedestrians generally cross the street at the crosswalks, which are placed next to traffic control devices. And many of those accidents are at intersections that lack directional control -- the driver doesn't pay attention, turns right and hits someone crossing the street.<p>The guy is right about a few things -- the regime of controlling traffic and handling peak demand is very inefficient. That's a feature of urban sprawl.<p>The problem with cars is that you get the ""network effect"" with respect to road capacity. Unlike computer networks, expanding capacity is alot harder than pulling a cable. Plus, if you have a two lane freeway or bridge, and you expand it to three lanes, traffic patterns will adjust and congest that road again. The New York City metropolitan area is a great example of this -- the driving suburbs of NYC extend nearly 75 miles north of the city at this point. People on Long Island literally commute over 2 hours to get to Manhattan via car and train.",1337174090

3981834,comment,3980809,3981673,2,0,jasonlotito,,,"> I can't see that your argument engages with anything I've said.<p>The GP remarked that comments that amounted to ""This isn't Reddit. Please keep on topic."" (TIR) are worthless.  You disagreed, and tried to explain why by suggesting that these comments discourage people from commenting.<p>My assertion is that not only does this not work within the system of HN, but that the TIR comment itself is of equal or less quality to that of the comment it's in reply to.<p>>  I've spelt out a plausible mechanism by which some comments would add value to the community (by preventing deterioration of standards of discourse).<p>Yes: discouragement through an off-topic comment that contributes <i>nothing</i> to the discussion.  By replying, your vote does not count (should up or downvote), and you also highlight the discussion.  In essence, rather than using the existing tools and protocol of HN (voting or flagging, ignoring trolls, and contributing posts that add to the discussion), your simply adding a TIR post.<p>You've made this claim (thought without specifying <i>why</i> it's superior to the existing methods), and yet ignored the simple fact that a TIR post is just as bad, if not worse, then the post it replies to.  At the very least, the post it replies to is at least, usually, on topic (Topicality is, of course, not the sole contributing factor to whether a comment is worthwhile).<p>> If you want to say otherwise, you'll have to take issue with that argument. As it stands, you've not done so.<p>Your inability to understand, or simply your attempt to dismiss my argument, does not negate my argument.  It's clear to any reasonable person the arguments I made.  If you are interested in an actual discussion, make an attempt.  Otherwise, you just come off as a troll.  Judging by your profile (which does matter, considering the nature of this discussion), I wouldn't be surprised.<p>> I don't see any reason to accept it, but even if it did we're talking about a specific subset of responses, and so I've presented an argument for why that subset would add value.<p>You've done so while ignoring the harm that the a TIR reply causes.  Maybe you aren't aware of the ability to upvote and downvote (I forget the threshold for those features), or flagging.  This is highlighted by your final comment:<p>> Finally, 'adding value' is more than just 'sparking valuable comments'. Comments can add value without sparking valuable comments by, e.g. re-enforcing valuable community norms.<p>Yes.  Adding value is more than just sparking valuable commentary or discussion.  What you fail to grasp is that your support of TIR is in direct contrast to valued community norms.  We have tools (upvotes, downvotes, and flagging) to handle these issues already.  A TIR does not enforce these norms, and in fact, flies in the face of what the community wishes to be.<p>These are outlined here:<p><a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a><p>The two that are important to this discussion are here:<p>""Please don't submit comments complaining that a submission is inappropriate for the site. If you think something is spam or offtopic, flag it by going to its page and clicking on the ""flag"" link. (Not all users will see this; there is a karma threshold.) If you flag something, please don't also comment that you did.""<p>And:<p>""If your account is less than a year old, please don't submit comments saying that HN is turning into Reddit. (It's a common semi-noob illusion.)""<p>TIR very much falls into both those categories.  Submissions are not <i>just</i> news stories, but comments as well.  If something is worth of a TIR comment, it also means you should just flag it.<p>Yes, public shaming (what TIR amounts to) can be effective in other environments.  HN chooses not to work that way.  It's what makes the community so mature and effective.",1337173708

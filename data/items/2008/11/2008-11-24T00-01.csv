So the on-topic material is quite broad. (Even better, personally, is permitting categorization such as sub-reddits, but with inheritance.) Still, the complaint is basically that one person thought article A was on-topic (hey it's my new blog! hey buy viagra!) and another person thought it was not.<p>An alternative to restricting the user-base--which I think will just reduce the variety of submission perspectives and depth, and only prevent off-topic-ness so much as the community is homogenous--is to<p>A. Make the ""topic-ness"" very clear. This might include reminder text or tutorials or mission statements, and it include the comments and voting mechanisms we already employ to pass-on the culture.<p>B.

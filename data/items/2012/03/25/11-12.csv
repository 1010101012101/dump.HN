Thankfully I had not yet deleted them.<p>The first message, on Mar 8, advertised the service. Then, on Mar 22, I received three messages in a row. The first advertising the service, the second welcoming me to the service and inviting me to cancel with a ""STOP"" message, and the third with some stupid fact.<p>In my case, the STOP message, which I sent just about 20 minutes ago, seems to have worked. I got a response claiming I was unsubscribed from messages and fees.<p>I never subscribed to anything in the first place. This is fraud, plain and simple. In my case, I ignored the first advertisement sent on the 8th. Had I actually subscribed to this service, they wouldn't need to advertise it first. Since their first round of messages on Mar. 8 didn't succeed, I imagine they got bolder and decided to subscribe me (and everyone else in that batch) without my having asked.<p>Since this was from a few days ago, I cannot check to see if anything was billed to my Verizon account yet.

3752324,comment,3750817,3752232,1,0,yorhel,,,"It's hard to pinpoint exactly why I was having so many problems with deadlocks. Most of the time they could easily be solved by having channels with an unbounded buffer, thus guaranteeing asynchronous behaviour. But since the Go authors intentionally left that out, I must be doing something wrong at a more fundamental level.<p>You're probably right about the IRC clients using the latter style of callbacks. But then it turns pretty much into the following style:<p><pre><code>  irc_connect();\n  register_event_x(callback_x);\n  register_event_y(callback_y);\n  while(read())\n    dispatch_event();\n</code></pre>\nWhich is essentially an event loop with callback-style dispatching. The only major difference here and with regular callback programming is that the callbacks are allowed to block. But in my mind that only complicates things as I can't tell anymore whether I can receive a particular event at some time because I have no idea whether there are any blocking handlers going on. Of course, you can dispatch everything into a separate goroutine, but then suddenly I can't easily argue anymore about the order of message arrival and what effect that has on shared state. Of course, this example may be a bit vague and abstract, but these resemble the kinds of issues I have constantly run in to.<p>On the scaling on multiple cores: Sure it's a nice advantage when you're already used to concurrent programming, but for most things I've written so far it doesn't really matter. In the few cases that I had a component that required heavy disk I/O or computational resources, it was only a small and easily-identifyable component that could be implemented in a separate OS thread. I'm not familiar with Node, but both glib2 and libev allow spawning a separate event loop in each thread and provide mechanisms to communicate between each other (idle functions in glib, ev_async in libev). Those are for C, however, and I have to admit that callback-style programming isn't too convenient there due to the lack of closures and automatic garbage collection.",1332674916

Among engineers you can often reason along very long logical chains and have your conclusions accepted. Among (some) business people you can't. They seem to refuse the validity of logic itself, being nervous about trusting logical conclusions. I think that's because they know their axiomatic systems are self-inconsistent. :)<p>By observing business people I have come to the conclusion that the best you can do in an a self-inconsistent axiomatic system is to look for ""nuggets of truth"" and never wonder too far from them. You can hear people say stuff like ""limiting tweets to 140 characters will brings out creativity - people are less afraid to create when they are constrained"" and similar. If you accept that as truth then you can wonder a short short distance from it and reason about business opportunities, but you can't combine that nugget with some other nugget and be sure to come to a correct conclusion.<p>Perhaps it is so, that the likelihood of ""proving"" an untrue statement in a self-inconsistent system increases with the number of axioms you are basing your proof on. That's perhaps why many people are very skeptical of ""proofs"" that seam to involve a lot of axioms? :)",1332674091

PHP is lacking in areas that make <i>fixing</i> that less of a nightmare, and lacking in areas -- both in the language, and in the community for lack of a better term -- that make <i>writing</i> maintainable stuff in the first place easier. The devs who know how to create maintainable PHP codebases, or fix unmaintainable ones tend to have experience with other languages.<p>This should be, in my opinion, a pretty major concern for business. While it may not be apparent at first, there tends to be diminishing returns from maintenance and development of a product if it's a giant mess. Doing PHP on new projects for ease-of-hire is inviting that mess, due to a whole bunch of little things that tend to snowball. Skilled people won't want to work for you, people that will be skilled but lack experience will leave your employ, and eventually the project will grind to an iceberg pace and stress levels will get high for everyone.<p>A good dev will probably not have a problem picking up whatever language, as long as you're using ""general-use"" languages. In the web-dev world, this is currently mostly ruby and python. Choose haskell, and you'll probably have some (read great) difficulty finding people to hire. Choose ruby or python and <i>you'll be more likely to attract the type of devs you want</i>, and at the worst you'll get someone inexperienced who makes a mess that is easier to fix than it would be in a PHP codebase of similar messiness.<p>If it was just the merits of the language, I don't think I'd have much of a leg to stand on talking from a business end. It's not though, it's a whole lot of little negative things that can make a long-term project more likely to be a failure. The language, and the tools, and the community are getting better, but that's mostly due to the efforts of people who are skilled and experienced with a variety of things improving it because it's paying their bills. It's still far, far away from any other ""popular"" language in terms of tools, community, available libraries, and just about any other measurement you can make other than ""number of people that can say they know it on a resume""",1332673698

I think it's sort of like what happens quite often between an investor and his fund: he makes some proclamations that are impractical and the market doesn't cooperate, and some significant portion of the employees just smile and nod but ignore it and keep collecting their base/bonus. So in this case, they feel they are forced to commit fraud and hide their losses.<p>I think that probably there are some desks in well-run firms where profits are high and traders don't run into these issues that they consider moral dilemmas. The managers and traders in those firms may say the other traders deserved to be fired based on their losses, but those privileged traders aren't aware of the disadvantages that the other traders are working against and don't realize the market simply moved against them.<p>Just thought I'd apply the same logic to another profession, albeit a profession for which most people hold few positive feelings.",1332673433

It doesn't have exceptions or parametric polymorphism either, but people seem to get a lot of work done. Fuck, people even get work done with Javascript, that's it's a bona fide example of a language with broken semantics (Harmony fixes some of those).<p>The thing is, ""fundamentally broken"" to me sounds like ""it's totally unusable"", and that is far from the truth. You might call it ""not as convenient as it could be"", but not ""fundamentally broken"". Broken implies ""it doesn't work"". Well, Go works fine.<p>Parametric polymorphism would be nice -- at least they are already thinking of adding generics in some v2.0 edition. But it's not a showstopper either, as in ""fundamentally broken"".<p><i>>I also think it's fundamentally pointed at the wrong problem domain: systems languages don't have runtime libraries, don't have garbage collection and don't require operating systems beneath them so that they can write free-standing systems code.</i><p>Well, by the ""systems"" moniker, they don't mean OSs and drivers, they mean what other people call large scale application systems. What you'd might use Erlang for, for example. Server stuff with high concurrency and big memory/cpu etc needs, but without all the C pain. From stuff like, say, Solr, to Hadoop, to Cassandra, etc, ...<p>><i>I can't say as much for every fad-of-the-decade-in-industry thing like Java or Go.</i><p>I wouldn't call Go ""fad of the decade"". For one it's not a fad, as it's not even popular.<p>>*And as to ""fads-of-the-day-in-academia"", Scala is the single best language I've ever used. And I don't even use all of it. I just use the subset of Scala that is Everything Java Should Have Been.<p>Well, I like Scala too. But it lacks some things that Go has, and help me in a few cases: no static binaries. No control over memory alignment. No dead easy FFI to C. No dead simple syntax I can understand in a weekend.<p>So, see, everything is a compromise.",1332673345

There's no way to know (from within the system) when that happens, except perhaps that it gets a whole lot easier to prove weird stuff. :)",1332673225

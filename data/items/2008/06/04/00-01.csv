Since going solo I've missed working with other people and have found that I'm learning new skills slower without regular code reviews, pair programming, etc. Here are some solutions I've been looking at:<p>1) Join a small company, such as a startup or web dev studio. The small size will ensure you have a chance to have a varied role and to do lots of different things.<p>2) Team up with other local developers to form a cooperative or studio of your own.",1212540261

However, I think you over simplified the issue. I lived in NYC, Jerusalem, Vancouver, Montreal, LA, San Fran. Yes, each city has its unique vibe but that does not mean other elements don't exist. You just have to find them. I live in Vancouver now. One may say that it is similar to Berkley in that the fundamental message is to live a better life. However, underneath that, there is art, greed, style, hipness etc. So yes, a city may have a theme but it is only that. Dig a little deeper and ye shall find what ye are seeking no matter the city.",1212540216

208473,comment,208398,208398,0,0,designtofly,,,"I disagree with just about every position that the author made. To be brief, I'll only counter the author's main position: ""The internet, along with all the other improvements have made the process of finding and acquiring information at cost approaching zero so trivial that the schools now seem out of place."" I say that this is exactly the reason why we will need schools even more so. The overwhelming amount of information necessitates a subject matter expert that can cut through the fads and focus on the first principles and fundamentals.<p>Secondly, any person who advocates for using Wikipedia as a primary source is clearly an idiot who has no appreciation or capability of primary source research.",1212539374

208460,story,,,1,4,seven2arms,"How do I get started in LISP?",,"I'd like to humor you with a story (although if you are feeling impatient and would like to get to the point, you can skip to the ""here it is"" part):<p>Now, I kept hearing about how great it is to learn LISP. It is supposed to adhere closely to what some people would call 'ideal' programming habits. I decided to give it a crack-- maybe what people say is true.<p>Unfortunately, what was supposed to be a short trip through the Google search engine ended up turning into a journey. No matter where I look, I can't find a LISP implementation.<p>It seems as if LISP doesn't have a very strong community (and when I say this, I mean in comparison to other programming language communities such as those for python or ruby).<p>I did manage to find a few downloads of what I think are implementations, but I feel as if they are outdated. I found more than enough material to learn from. There are great books and tutorials all over the internet.<p>So here it is: Can anyone direct me to the appropriate website where one can download the CLISP (common lisp) implementation for Windows (my Unix machine is down right now)?<p>Before somebody blows up on me for asking such a dumb question, let me explain why I posted this question here of all places:(1) this place seemed like my best bet since it seems like the largest gathering of people who may know LISP outside of actual LISP-related conferences (2) It may help others who fell victim to the same issue.",1212538099

208456,story,,,2,3,rob,"Ask YC: Questions on ASP.NET and Windows hosting (getting started)",,"To preface this, I know pretty much nothing about ASP.NET or Windows hosting. I know the two are not popular here, but I figure someone knows something about them. I'm very familiar with Linux servers and PHP/MySQL, but I have some free time this summer and wanted to look into ASP.NET a little more closely.<p>Before I look into it, I'd like to know just how different the hosting aspect of it is compared to the traditional Linux/PHP setup. I'm not interested in the language/design differences right now. Note that this won't be for a startup, but rather someone who might make a couple of small CRUD-type sites; nothing crazy.<p>For example, PHP shared hosting is a dime-a-dozen, and there are some very good providers out there. I see that there are some shared ASP.NET hosts with good reviews as well, notably discountasp.net; would this be fine for small websites, or do all ASP.NET websites really require a VPS/dedicated server (much like Rails)?<p>Likewise with a Windows VPS: I see these being offered pretty cheap (~$30-40/month) that comes with Windows Server 2003. I'm guessing I would be running IIS. Would Windows Server 2003 be difficult to set up and manage from someone who is used to setting up Linux servers? On the same note, how memory-intensive are simple ASP.NET websites? On a 256MB VPS running Linux and PHP, one can fit a ton of small-traffic sites on it with no problems.<p>Finally, would I need to pay anything in terms of licenses? It seems Visual Web Developer and SQL Server 2005 (Express Edition) can be downloaded for free to play around with, and it doesn't seem like you need a server license when you purchase a VPS.",1212537812

Really like the simplified object literals. The use of global variables for class state is deeply troubling - they are not scoped at all. The parser is far too forgiving. if you change do |x| x<i>x into something like do x x</i>x it will compile fine, but be wrong. The tooling is quite nice, and I like the defaults - although it&#x27;s still a little bit of a mystery where the imba.js file comes from in the Hello World browser example (I ended up just copying it from Github). I&#x27;d like to see argument comprehensions, and the option to generate code outside of an immediately excuting function (so I can play with instances at the dev console)<p>I would like to see a &quot;strict&quot; mode for imba that chokes on a do block without pipes, for example.

At higher latitudes, warmer weather leads to more snow. So that&#x27;s a starting point that higher temperatures don&#x27;t necessarily mean less snow. But furthermore, if you have scientifically gathered data that says there&#x27;s a trend towards warming, it&#x27;s reasonable to look at heat waves and recognize them as part of a larger problem, since it&#x27;s supported by data.<p>However, if you pull out anecdotes that contradict the data, you&#x27;re trying to muddle the issue and make it look like the data is invalid, even though you have no basis for that conclusion.<p>> Conservatives prefer having better environment for businesses which will boost innovation.

10093714,comment,10093026,10093026,0,0,mindcrime,,,"Momentum is definitely a big thing.  When you get a little bit, everything seems to feel a little bit easier. Your morale and confidence peak, it&#x27;s easier to stay motivated and focused, and the sky even seems bluer.  OK, maybe not that last bit, but you know what I mean.<p>We were in a place like that towards the end of last year. We got invited (finally, after several applications) to the CED Tech Venture Conference, which was an important chance to raise our visibility, meet investors, etc., and I had speaking engagements lined up at All Things Open, Tri-JUG and an NCTA event.  In the span of 2 months we had 4 big chances to be &quot;out there&quot; getting our name out, and we had some really cool new stuff ready to demo... life was good.<p>And then two weeks after All Things Open, I find myself on the back of an ambulance, being rushed to the hospital with a heart attack. Talk about your momentum killers.  :-(<p>After that, things went into something of a tailspin.  Obviously there was a period of time when I couldn&#x27;t have cared less about startups, business, or even technology.  I was just happy to be alive, and was focused on bike riding, diet, and cardiac rehab.   But all through that, I figured it would be easy enough - eventually - to step back into working on Fogbeam and get things moving again.  As it happens, it hasn&#x27;t been quite so easy.<p>I mean, don&#x27;t get me wrong... I&#x27;m back.  Definitely, absolutely, 100%, back.  But I can only say that as of maybe sometime in the past month.  But there was a 9 month gap in there where I really just wasn&#x27;t in the right place mentally to focus on this.  It&#x27;s hard to explain, as I was back to normal physically within a couple of months, but the mental recovery was actually the harder part, and getting back to where I am excited about technology and excited about building a company took a LOT longer than I expected.<p>I had a little false start back in Feb., when I wrote some code, did some stuff, and thought I was back on the horse, but it didn&#x27;t last.  It&#x27;s been discouraging to deal with all this, and even more so very exactly <i>because</i> all of this happened when we did have some momentum going.  Now I find myself wondering what it&#x27;s going to take to get that back.<p>I guess there are a lot of things that can kill your momentum:  the &quot;fake work&quot; that sama talks about, dealing with fundraising, dealing with acquisition talks, whatever.  But from my personal experience I&#x27;ll just throw in &quot;health issues&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m sure you guys get (or will get) tired of hearing about this from me, and I am <i>generally</i> not the preachy type but I&#x27;ll reiterate this again: pay attention to your health.  No, really, do it.  It&#x27;s super easy to assume you&#x27;re indestructible and immortal, and to push aside concerns about health.  I know, I lived that.  And the younger you are, the easier it is.<p>But trust me, it&#x27;s not a good idea to blow that stuff off, no matter how young you are.  Don&#x27;t say &quot;I&#x27;ll wait to get back in shape once we have  our exit&quot;. I mean, there probably won&#x27;t be an exit if you&#x27;re dead; and if there is, you won&#x27;t exactly benefit from it.  And remember, on things like heart disease, the artery damage that leads to heart attacks and the like, can begin really young.  Even as young as your teenage years.  So no matter how busy you are, or how old you are, NOW is the time to start eating right, lose weight, quit smoking, whatever it is you need to do.<p>Sorry, I&#x27;ll step off the soapbox now.",1440095537

War on drugs is obvious in the population, the decriminalization of marijuana is obviously happening. The response that you&#x27;ve pointed out from the article here on HN supports the idea that many people have a strong belief that mandatory minimum sentences and a tough of drugs stance has helped to flood the prison systems.<p>Now you say the author appears to be against the drug war and against mass incarceration. During his research he sees that drug related incarcerations aren&#x27;t nearly as large a problem as the increase in seeking felony charges. He writes this paper, says hey look at this other problem inside a problem!<p>But he doesn&#x27;t make it clear, and I judge this from the comments here, that he thinks the initial problems exist. Thus positioning himself against them because the counter arguments will be made by the opponents of the end to the drug war, and the people who say mass incarceration isn&#x27;t an issue will point to this paper and say: &quot;See the drugs aren&#x27;t the problem the violence is increasing, therefore we suggest that your honor not repeal prohibition&quot;<p>You want the deck stacked in your favor, the mass opinion needs to be on your side, to suggest alternatives is to weaken the force trying to repeal prohibition. To weaken the arguments to the point where no decision can be made is still winning for the people wanting to keep the war on drugs going and the incarceration rate up. Indecision is loss, you&#x27;d want to have a unified voice to make the change happen.<p>That you&#x27;ve highlighted these points so much is commendable, but the author should have done that work for you from the outset. You are relying on people giving the cognitive effort required to come to their own conclusions. That is a mistake when you are dealing with more then on person, and we want everyone to agree to end the drug war right?<p>Thus the way to do that, even if the author sees this other problem in a problem, is to put his weight and effort into reinforcing the existing propositions. Then once those propositions are past, which is incredibly hard, highlight the other problem areas. Start from the outside in and from the positions with the most support. The war on drugs appears to be weakening, but it isn&#x27;t done, and the mass opinion can&#x27;t handle a distraction, which gives power to the incumbents.<p>So he is right, felony handouts are the bigger problem by percentage. Try and argue that assault with a deadly weapon charge should see a reduced sentence, or any other more grevious charge, and you&#x27;ll be fighting the &quot;think of the children crowd&quot;, the &quot;why do you want the murderer of my child to go free parent&quot;. Right now the power is building to reduce the war on drugs, which would reduce incarcerations by a measurable amount. Put the focus there, then continue with a winning moment in the end of prohibition to say &quot;look here there is another terrible atrocity, lets keep making America better!&quot;<p>There is more than changing laws to being right, and I think that is why you&#x27;re seeing the response you&#x27;ve highlighted in your multiple comments.",1440095302

But afterwards I want to be able to go home, make some dinner, and read for a bit (or whatever else).  If I had 3-4 6+ABV IPAs, then Ill be too drunk to enjoy the rest of my evening.  So Ive started drinking light beers after work.<p>I enjoy good beer quite a bit, but it seems that every micro brew is at least 5% ABV.  That simply doesn&#x27;t fit with my typical pattern of drinking now that I&#x27;m several years away from college.

The economics of hacking alone work in your favor. :)<p>Personally, I think they should&#x27;ve tried to license Cavium&#x27;s Octeon III processors: RISC (MIPS) ISA; 48 cores at 2.5GHz; many pre-made accelerator engines; huge I/O bandwidth. A royalty deal that made Cavium money for profit & continued R&D, while letting Sony have them cheap in PS4, would&#x27;ve made for one, badass gaming rig. Cavium might have had upgrades ready for PS5, too, given all the improvements they made going from Octeon II to III.<p>Everyone went with AMD instead. So, we get the real benefits of reuse of x86 code, low-costs, and reduced production issues. However, we also get all the black-boxes of risk in x86, a monoculture where an attack on AMD CPU&#x27;s/firmware might break all game systems, inherent inefficiencies of x86, and lack of hardware differentiation (mainly accelerators) that developers can benefit from.

I think the signal of working hard is how often you let yourself get into your comfort zone and coast.<p>I think working hard means pushing yourself out of your comfort zone - continuously. It means forcing yourself to ask the hard questions about your business you&#x27;re scared to ask. It means figuring out how to do things you&#x27;re not good at, like hiring or selling. It means identifying the most important problem for your company today, and tackling it, even if it&#x27;s not what you want to be doing.<p>I&#x27;d guess that during YC, the partners and the community act as a force to keep people asking the hard, honest questions about their business. And I&#x27;d guess that after YC, without those outside forces, people revert to their default comfort zones, with things that feel nice. Getting press feels nice. Going to conferences feels nice. But what&#x27;s true early is true later too: it&#x27;s the work that doesn&#x27;t feel nice that usually matters most.<p>You could spend 40 hours a week in the office doing the right things, or 100 hours doing the wrong ones. One of those will lead to growth, the other one won&#x27;t. And it doesn&#x27;t have to do with the hours.",1440094487

So the real market of actual lawyers is pretty restrained by the number of entry level jobs established lawyers hire.<p>A good 50% of law students are out of law within a couple years, and large number of those never work as a lawyer. It&#x27;s tough to create your own job because nobody trusts you.<p>And even if you do work as a lawyer, not all lawyers are fungible.

The guy who writes patents doesn&#x27;t know how to handle a bankruptcy.<p>So you can get a guy to do your DUI for 500 bucks, but my firm would charge you 550/hr just to talk to you on the phone.<p>Another big reason is that law is a very prestige and pedigree heavy industry. Why would a firm hire a Duke grad for 160k, when you can get 4 Brooklyn law school grads for that? Rightly or wrongly, the Brooklyn grads are seen as incapable of doing the job.<p>Clients then hire the well known firm for their big cases and matters because they have a good reputation.<p>That is sort of changing. Big companies use smaller firms for smaller matters and cases where spending 700 an hour for legal work doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>Some would argue legal rates aren&#x27;t even too high. For example, for transaction lawyers, their fees are a fraction of what the investment banker takes on a deal.<p>But the biggest reason that legal services are expensive is that legal service is man-hour heavy and essentially doesn&#x27;t scale.<p>Look at even blue collar services that are manhour heavy like mechanics.

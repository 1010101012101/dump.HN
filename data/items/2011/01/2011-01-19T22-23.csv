From my understanding, solar flares themselves can't be detected optically yet. Note: It may very well be possible that Kepler can do this, but I don't know. I'm just an amateur.
In one instance of extrasolar flare detection, <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/monster_flare..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/monster_flare...</a>, it was found by SWIFT detecting high x-rays coming from II Pegasi.

Identical twins turn out quite similar regardless of whether they grow up in the same family, while adopted siblings are as different as any random people. (Check ""How the Mind Works"" by Pinker for a great overview.) People have a hard time accepting this, since most would like to believe that they have a power to shape their children, but this does not make it any less true.<p>> the Immigration Act of 1965... didn't just abolish racial quotas, it also created preference categories for science, math and engineering-trained immigrants to come over.<p>Ah, so Asian immigrants to the US are far from an unbiased sample of their original populations!

2121541,comment,2119592,2119735,0,0,chipsy,,,"No, you have to know your design before you can judge collision's needs properly, and you have to have some expectation that you'll get it wrong the first time and require iteration, because collision _is_ gameplay when we speak of games using a lot of spatial elements. Otherwise you are implicitly making the engine determine the design - which is acceptable in some circumstances, but increasingly likely to cause problems as you try to specialize the design. So it's OK to start with simple assumptions and wait for them to break. You aren't (yet) working with a live system where data is lost by changing collision. Let me give some examples.<p>Pistol Slut, for example, doesn't introduce any special handling for environmental collisions(platforms, ledges, etc.) because it doesn't focus on that kind of platforming gameplay. In a distance game like Toss the Turtle or Hedgehog Launch, resolving fast-moving collisions by constructing swept polygons becomes a very good idea. In an game like an RTS where you have lots of unit movement, collision may take place with points on the tile-map, building on the pathfinding algorithms, rather than by handling a separate set of collision structures. In a game like Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, you have to develop some kind of history of object state, including collision, so that the game works properly when time is reversed. In a game spanning very large distances you have to account for numeric precision(i.e. you can't just throw in a floating-point type and be done). In a networked game you have to include some interpolation, prediction, and compensation for latency so as to improve the feel of hit registration. And so on...<p>In all cases, a substantial part of gameplay rests upon technical assumptions. Trying to combine every collision feature you can conceive of into one universal system will increase your effort into the man-years range very quickly, so it's not done that way.",1295476381

Some implementations have an executor object that determines the size of the thread pool and so forth, but the basic principle is the same.<p>For example, in Python it's:<p><pre><code>    executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1)
    x = executor.submit(func, arg1, arg2)
    print x.result()
</code></pre>
In Clojure it's:<p><pre><code>    (let [x (future (func arg1 arg2))]
      (println @x))
</code></pre>
In Java:<p><pre><code>    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1);
    FutureTask<String> x =
        new FutureTask<String>(new Callable<String>() {
            public String call() {

Basically the same idea; execute some code in a background thread and return the result when asked.

'Many' is defined as 'a large number of' and 'much' is defined as 'a large amount'. This naturally implies a statistically significant large majority, not a simple majority such as 51 to 49.<p>When there is a close division we don't say, 'most of the Senators' we say 'just more than half of the Senators'. This is because we haven't reached a point where we can adequately say that a 'a large number' (as compared to those voting against) 'has voted for'. For this reason we reserve 'most' for situations where more than a simple majority, e.g. often a supermajority, comprises one of the two or more things we are comparing.<p>Actually, grammatically speaking, superlative adjectives should _only_ be used when three or more things are being compared, however this is a commonly ignored rule.<p>There is one final point, when one of the two or more things you are comparing reaches a point where it is greater than two thirds of the total, we begin to say 'nearly all,' ""Nearly all of the Senators voted to pass the finance reform bill today, voting 89-11.""",1295476325

So the server ends up with hundreds of threads, most of them probably waiting for input (waiting for the HTTP request). MzScheme can be inefficient when there are 100s of threads waiting for input -- when it wants to find a thread to run, it asks the O/S kernel about each socket in turn to see if any input is ready, and that's a lot of asking per thread switch if there are lots of threads. So the server is able to complete fewer requests per second when there is a big backlog, which lets more backlog accumulate, and perhaps it takes a long time for the server to recover.""<p>I may have misunderstood but it sounds like you have MzScheme facing the open internet? Try putting nginx (or another epoll/kqueue based server) in front of MzScheme. It will handle the thousands of connections you have that are waiting for IO with very little incremental CPU load and with a single thread. Then when nginx reverse proxies to MzScheme each request happens very fast because it's local which means you need much fewer threads for your app server. That means less memory and less of the other overhead that you get with a high thread count.<p>An additional advantage is that you can enable keepalive again (right now you have it disabled it looks like) which makes things a faster for first-time visitors. It also makes it slightly faster for us regulars because the conditional gets we do for the gif's and css won't have to reestablish connections. Less connections established means you give your OS a break too with fewer syn/syn-ack/ack TCP handshakes.<p>Someone mentioned below that reverse proxies won't work for HN. They mean that caching won't work - but a reverse proxy like nginx that doesn't cache but handles high concurrency efficiently should give you a huge perf improvement.<p>PS: I'd love to help implement this free.

2121453,comment,2120927,2120927,0,0,bane,,,"I had the great opportunity in my undergrad college compiler class to write an entire ecosystem to understand better how some of this stuff works. We didn't just write a compiler, we wrote an emulator for a simple, notional architecture. The whole thing was simple enough that we could write the compiler toolkit, the system emulator/VM and run it in a few days.<p>Then for extra credit we could rewrite the whole thing (or part of it) in another language. And/or get a guaranteed A if we could make the whole shebang self-hosting.<p>It was a really great way of understanding the basics of a system architecture.<p>As for the emulator, it was pretty primitive, but basically it loaded the compiled program code into memory, then would read an operation's worth of bytes, look the operation up in some kind of lookup table (or similar) that mapped the emulated system's instructions to local system instructions say, x86, and execute that operation.<p>Sometimes the mapping resulted in several operations on the host side the emulated system might execute in one.<p>eg.
   ADD R1, R2, R3<p>might add the contents of registers r2 and r3, then put the result into r1. In x86 it would be more like<p><pre><code>   ADD AX, BX
   MOV CX, AX
</code></pre>
or some such.<p>(actually we did it a little higher level then that, but that's the idea).<p>So an emulator needs to provide all of the various registers and operations and such so that the code can execute, it likely has to have the ability emulate the memory architecture and translate I/O appropriately. Some older systems for example could only output to a printer terminal, or to a simple status display, on a modern system you have to translate calls to those output devices to equivalent ones on your system (like the screen).<p>More complex system may need to emulate several processors. The SNES and Amiga for example have a handful of chips that not only need to be emulated, but much of the software assumes a particular timing in the interaction of those components that can be very challenging to get right and keeping track of all that and running at reasonable performance can require fast hardware.<p>These days though, not many emulators use the simple execution mechanism I outlined above. Many of them have sophisticated code profiling and execution caches that can significantly speed up the emulation.<p>In these terms, emulating a system, or a VM (like Java) or some other runtime environment (like Javascript and the V8 runtime for example) isn't really all that different and there's huge crossover in the theoretical concepts between these areas.",1295474587

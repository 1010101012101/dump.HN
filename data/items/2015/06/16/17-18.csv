This package definitely has it&#x27;s advantages over Excel, especially for large or complex LP problems where I have found Excel to be much slower and/or incapable of finding as food of a solution. However, for someone learning about LP (linear programming) or integer programming, it&#x27;s unlikely that they will be doing anything that can&#x27;t be done efficiently enough in Excel, particularly with an add-on such as OpenSolver. I think that Excel is just easier to use than any of the Python packages that I&#x27;ve come across for this (hopefully that will change though!).

Maybe you can get close to a million requests per second in some of the native servers delivering static plain text / json on top of the line hardware. Eventually though you need to build and ship an application and some software that does more than a few queries.<p>High performing/scalable systems are built from lots of pieces of interconnected software like caching software (Redis, memcached, etc), work/job queues (RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ), asynchronous database queries and probably other things? The way these pieces fit together make much more of a difference than the server / framework you pick. I&#x27;d say it doesn&#x27;t largely matter which Python framework you choose when you still have a blocking SQL query that has to be done on each request. The difference will be microseconds compared to how long that query takes.<p>It is important to benchmark/profile though. Maybe not at the framework level but as part of the continuous integration process. Determine what parts are slow, what parts could be replaced with asynchronous / event based code, and what parts should be replaced with something written in native code (C, Go, or Rust I guess) especially because Python makes it easy to integrate directly with native code (at least in C, I don&#x27;t have experience with Python talking to Go or Rust).",1434477093

9727470,comment,9726356,9726558,0,0,trcollinson,,,"Software engineers are meant to bring value to a company at some multiplier of their own rate of consumption. In other words, we&#x27;re meant to bring more value to the company than we take away in salary and benefits and such. If an engineer is not bringing in more than they are taking out, they are removed and replaced without so much as a second thought. Companies have zero problem removing unproductive employees. Software engineers work almost (though not entirely) like a commodity.<p>With that said, if an engineer is bringing value and the company is not satisfying the needs of the engineer in some way, then the engineer should leave and find another position in which they will be satisfied while bringing significant value to the new company.<p>If a company can remove an engineer at the drop of a hat, why should an engineer not be able to do the same with a company? We put far too much emotion into these sorts of decisions. When it comes down to it the average engineer has about 90,000 effective working hours to sell in his or her lifetime. It is best to get the most out of those hours possible, whether that be purely financial (trading the most dollars for those hours as possible) or some other metric (the most satisfaction per hour traded). Quitting a job whenever your value per hour is too low for a higher value per hour is ABSOLUTELY the thing you should do.<p>Never sit at a job longer than you are satisfied. It is up to the company to keep you satisfied just as much as it is up to you to keep the company satisfied.",1434476492

A snippet:<p><i>[...] Lakhera referred to the fact that there are pretty much no IPv4 addresses left and that the big cellular carriers really don&#x27;t want to continue running IPv4 and IPv6 side by side in dual stack configuration—apparently, IPv6-only cellular service is coming. Soon.</i><p><i>The way Apple is addressing that situation is to make sure that all iOS apps support IPv6. However, many servers are still IPv4-only. To reach those, the cellular networks are going to deploy NAT64 translators. NAT64 allows IPv6 applications to access IPv4 servers. Without these translators, IPv6 applications ask the DNS for IPv6 addresses to connect to, but obviously IPv4-only servers don&#x27;t have IPv6 addresses, so a regular DNS server then returns an empty list of IPv6 addresses, leaving the application all dressed up with nowhere to go. A DNS64 server, on the other hand, creates a &quot;synthetic&quot; IPv6 address that the application can use. The packets sent to those addresses end up at the NAT64 translator, which recovers the IPv4 address of the intended destination using the IPv6 address created by the DNS64 and translates the packet from IPv6 to IPv4.

But I&#x27;ve got loads of experience with both .NET and Objective-C / Cocoa.<p>Most of my experience has been on the .NET platform and primarily on the backend / distributed systems side of things.<p>However, between 2010 and 2013, I was co-founder and CTO of a tech startup where our main product was a fairly sophisticated native iOS app. Being a bootstrapped startup, I had to do all the tech work myself. So I got a lot of experience with Objective-C / Cocoa that way. On the back of that, I got a contract to develop a native iPad app for the BBC, providing me with some additional experience building an app for an external client.<p>When I landed on the job market in January last year, I was therefore happy to take either an iOS contract or a .NET one.<p>I ended up taking a .NET contract. And to be completely honest, large-scale software systems / distributed systems is really where my heart lies. So I&#x27;m now pitching myself as a .NET developer only as this is the type of role I&#x27;m most keen on.<p>I&#x27;d actually be really happy to take on a role that uses another stack as well.

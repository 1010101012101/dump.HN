523013,comment,522197,522740,0,0,silentOpen,,,"The irony is that these ""bonuses"" aren't meritocratic like your good teacher/bad teacher scenario. These are retention bonuses contractually agreed to by AIG and their employees.<p>Last year, back when AIG knew things were hitting the fan, they decided to offer a carrot to employees who would stay through the storm. Turns out, AIG is ""too big to fail"" so those that decided to stay with AIG through our current adventure appear to be getting rewarded for incompetence.",1237449069

523011,comment,522816,522816,0,0,blasdel,,,"While I was cooking dinner after posting this, I came up with an awesome solution to OCZ's dilemma. They're driven to boost streaming large-block bandwidth so that they have big numbers to advertise, but they're doing that at the expense of crippling random small writes. So they should do do this:<p><pre><code>  * Offer two different lines with the same hardware but differing firmwares optimized for each.
  * Sell the IOPS-targeted one as 'Enterprise Grade' for %50 more.
  * Release regular firmware updates for both, and ensure that only a trivial (but *WARRANTY VOIDING*)
    modification keeps you from flashing your consumer drive with the 'enterprise' firmware.
  * Bask in the glow of heavily-dugg tutorials about how to 'mod' your consumer drive for low-latencies
  * Have vendors purchase your cheaper-than-intel 'Enterprise' drive for CYA reasons.</code></pre>",1237448876

The system allows user to define any number of entity like Contact (Name,Address, Phone No, ..), CC-Txion Info (...) in easy steps (like online form creator but easier) and add data to it. Allows to download data (Excel) and cleanup the data if needed. Common search feature to search for info across all entities. Basically this system lies between Unstructured wiki (Easy) and Complex website generator (Online form/page builder) (Complex).",1237448861

In this world, we might have calculators which were designed to provide the wrong answer, so that people would type in 36 x 50, get -7 as the answer, and say ""Hah, I'm much better at this than you are.""<p>In this world, which parallels the MMORPG use case, yes, its cheaper to keep a calculator to be the whipping boy than to keep around a human who has been instructed to perform math poorly.",1237448121

However, they should probably put out a pricing plan soon. It might even draw more interest to their company (a giffen good!) because potential customers might want to do business with a company that looks like it is making money and therefore stable.",1237447979

No.<p>If you create an imaginary baseline SSD with the X25-M's 80 GB and the Vertex's 9836 PCMarks and then compare both drives against the baseline you get:<p>Intel: 20% faster<p>OCZ: 50% larger<p>Both cost $350.

It's <i>definitely</i> not your only chance at creating a relatively small business that has revenues of millions of dollars per year.<p>There have always been and always will be plenty of markets that are being neglected for one reason or another.

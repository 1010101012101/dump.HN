He brought up a quote by the main heroine from Gone with the Wind where she said &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine what it would be like to be hungry all the time&quot;. Putin then pointed out that something like this is a primary concern of an American soul (implying base concerns for physical comforts), while this wouldn&#x27;t be a concern for the Russian soul, which allegedly is concerned with much more important spiritual matters.</i><p>It makes perfect sense.

That&#x27;s why the market idea is so seductive, things take care of themselves. I think there is definitely an argument to be made that the current education system could be considered distorted, but that&#x27;s not the point. The point is that if CEOs are out there begging the government to intervene to increase the supply of worker type X, it means that they are either admitting that the labor market is fundamentally broken, or they are just trying to artificially lower the wages they have to pay (or prevent them from rising). In the former scenario, we&#x27;ve got a broken labor market, and in the latter scenario, those CEOs are <i>trying</i> to break the labor market.

If the world has any duty to those inside Syria, it is to safeguard the lives of the innocent.  How will rocket attacks accomplish this?<p>The second U.S.-Iraq war and the subsequent occupation proved that state-of-the-art precision air and rocket strikes are still a very blunt instrument that cause a lot of civilian casualties when used. More innocent people died during the U.S. occupation than under Hussein!  A big reason for this was the U.S.&#x27;s over-reliance on technology.  Instead of using foot-patrols and talking to the locals, who might have been inclined to point out that they&#x27;d seen rebels planting IED&#x27;s, U.S. SOP was to ride over the locals (and anything else) in tanks and hummers and call in air-strikes if they felt threatened. Forces from other nations, such as the UK, proved the effectiveness of foot-patrols, but the U.S. still largely ignores this. Technology has transformed the face of war, but the fundamental fact that boots on the ground are what let you hold territory has not changed one bit.  The U.S. ignored this in Vietnam, ignored this in the first Iraq war, ignored it in the second Iraq war, and continues to ignore it in Afghanistan.  You can&#x27;t cower in a fort, blowing things up with rockets and drones and expect to actually provide security!<p>What the U.S. proposes to do is to keep their soldiers safe in remote locations while raining robotic death down on Syrian government positions that, if they weren&#x27;t already hardened, probably started preparing for air strikes after the 2006 war with Israel (Note: Israel was attacking Hezbollah, but did far more damage to civilian infrastructure).  Will air strikes have much of an impact on Syrian government forces?  What security will Syrian civilians gain as a result?<p>There are ways to provide security for Syrian civilians, but all they require boots on the ground.  A force could be sent to get in between the rebels and government forces, but they&#x27;d get the holy hell pounded out of them from both sides! Peace-making forces do not exist for a reason. If a cease-fire could be negotiated, perhaps peace-keeping forces could be sent in.  This carries a lot of risk if negotiations break down.  A third option is to occupy a portion of Syria or territory bordering with Syria, establish refugee camps, and try to provide ways for civilians to relocate safely.<p>It&#x27;s great that the U.S. wants to do something to help Syrian civilians, but blowing stuff up like retarded cowboys isn&#x27;t the answer.",1378953620

And it&#x27;s ignored when you need to kick ass regardless of the circumstances.<p>Yes, Putin, this new turn of events is great for making Russia look like a big power, but the only reason the U.S. is even looking at this is because we really, really don&#x27;t want to bother with Syria. In fact, we kind of like that Assad is weakened by the civil war but still strong enough to stay in power. That means he is well occupied, but we still know who it is that we are dealing with.<p>Unfortunately, Obama screwed up with that red line thing. He didn&#x27;t have to say that. He could have made his case regardless if he really wanted to. But chemical weapons are certainly a problem. We don&#x27;t want those things coming back at us. And even if the Assad regime were to go down, we would probably need boots on the ground to secure those stocks. So, giving the chemical weapons over to international control is a slice of pie handed to us on a silver platter.<p>We doubt that you can really pull this off, Putin, but we thank you for trying.

As a small business that was approached by a large organization with potential to drive us a ton of new customers, I had a great opportunity. But, I also saw some risk, due to the sheer size. So, I let my lawyer review it, which initiated a death spiral.<p>In retrospect, there was nothing onerous in the initial proposal. My attorney just wanted to cover all bases. That&#x27;s how they envision their jobs: If a client ends up in a bad situation that could have remotely been avoided, then they have failed (in their eyes). But, there is sometimes no scale brought to bear. Any degree of risk--no matter how small--becomes a point of contention.<p>The funny part is that I and the biz dev guy on the other side just wanted to get it done. But, we became unwilling conduits for lawyers who tried to eliminate all risk from their respective sides and we just wound up passing marked-up agreements back and forth until we (and the deal) were exhausted.<p>So, I learned that all of this legal &quot;protection&quot; must be taken with a grain of salt for the small business owner in particular. The upside is generally so much greater than the risk for us, and in the off chance that the risk becomes a reality, it can generally be mitigated then.<p>There is risk to simply being in business, especially in this litigious society. So, you cannot deny yourself an opportunity simply because your lawyer couldn&#x27;t wrangle every last bit of risk out for you. And, when you assume that posture of trying to eliminate risk completely from your side, then you have to know that the legal folks on the other side will follow suit. That&#x27;s when the show stops.<p>The advice given to the author by his dad is exactly what I&#x27;d give to my kids, minus the expletives.",1378952036

Looking up information on someone could be considered stalking, but if there was no likely bad outcome from it, then its harmless. In the same way, sneaking into a movie theater without a ticket is usually a bad thing, but if you actually bought a ticket and then you accidentally dropped your ticket in the gutter, your sneaking in is moral and acceptable. Its all about the expected result, not the means you use.<p>Why is stalking a woman bad in the first place? Because the stalker might get so obsessed that they get violent with or rape the woman. Or because the woman might feel like her privacy has been violated. Or the woman might feel nervous around the stalker, not knowing what they want.<p>None of these bad situations were going to result from this type of information-gathering. The engineer was not planning to hurt this woman or interfere with her in any way. The woman would not feel that her privacy has been violated, because they just want her name, and the woman probably wouldnt mind if the bet-taker just told the engineer her name. And the woman knows what this stalker wants  to win a one-time bet. So she wont be nervous about his intentions winning a bet to find out a name is a harmless action that does not inspire worry.<p>As for posting her information online, yes, it seems like the engineer had an unintentional privacy leak in that they showed Facebook users from her high school her picture. (I dont think he was purposefully <i>lying</i> about posting her info, I think he just didnt consider the photo significant.) Showing the photo could be bad if the woman didnt want anyone seeing that dress she bought, or didnt want her alumni to be reminded of her. You could argue that showing the photo to those users was a mistake on the engineers part.<p>But you should keep in mind that the chances were pretty low that this womans picture leaked anything significant to her former high school classmates. Its very likely that they didnt care what dress she is wearing. Many of them saw her face already when she was actually in high school, and as for the ones who had not, seeing a normal photo of a random woman in a dress is unlikely to cause anything bad.

To make it a bit more realistic, if you save 15,000 per year and get 6% returns annually, it will take about 33 years.

But if at that time you have all your assets (house, car, etc) paid for, you can live on a lower monthly income.  So if you are married by that time, and keep your withdraws to less than 70,000 a year, you only pay 15% tax.  Oh, and you have to wait till your mid 50&#x27;s to start taking out of 401k without paying a 10% penalty.  (which is why a smart strategy is to use 401k as just one of several investment saving strategies).<p>The real benefit of 401k is if your employer matches funds.  This can essentially double your contributions.  And since there is a built in rule that keeps you from taking it out till you are close to retirement age, it lessens the chance that you will take it out early and blow through it when you are younger.",1378951618

FWIW, I think treating that kind of transient state as part of the model is unwise.<p>If its metadata that applies to one specific view, as with your scrollbar example, it can live on the view. The corresponding controller can then send suitable commands to the view to update it in response to user actions, and the model is completely unaffected.<p>If its metadata that is shared among multiple views, such as which element of a system has a focus/active state or something like a clipboard/kill ring, then I prefer to introduce a completely separate component. Each affected view will observe that metadata component in the same way it observes the model, and therefore each corresponding controller can update that metadata component in response to a user action on its view and all affected views will react. Often, the metadata component may itself also observe the real model, so that for example if an item with focus is deleted from the model it will also cease to be recorded as the current selection in the metadata for any views.<p>This approach isnt quite as tidy as pure MVC, but it does maintain clear responsibilities and collaborations between all of the components involved. In particular, it maintains the general design principles of MVC, and it does prevent anything that isnt really persistent state or related business logic from polluting the model.",1378951440

781158,comment,780851,780942,0,0,hc,,,"> In relation to this article, it says that when you build a model that fits the data, it's not enough. It's a further requirement that the model makes testable predications that turn out to be correct. Models that make accurate predications are valuable. Models that aren't then tested by checking their predictions are, by definition, untested.<p>the problem with the article is that it lumps in many 'models' with wholly untested ones undeservedly, saying <i>And no, that does not mean simply training your model on half of your data set and showing that you can effectively explain the other half of your data.</i> That is hypocritical because this is more or less precisely what scientists, following the ""scientific method"", are doing, albeit many times slower than a computer with a parametric model.<p>> I'd be interested to know why you describe making falsifiable models is just ""a learning algorithm.""<p>what happens in some piece of the world over some duration of time can be represented as a function from that piece of the world's initial state to its final state. in the sciences, we try to estimate such functions. the scientific method is a very simple algorithm for doing so: generate a hypothesis, compute N ""testable predictions"" f(x_i)\approx y_i, and then accept your hypothesis if they all turn out to be correct.",1251067946

Individuals will sometimes come up after a talk and want to have a 15 minute conversation--or try and have an argument of some sort--when three other people are waiting.

Note that a symptom is a prospect's perception of the problem, a diagnosis is the practitioners description.<p>After the talk exchange business cards with anyone who comes up. If there is some way you can assist them (e.g. send them a url or other info, make an intro) or a point you want to remember, jot down a 2-3 word note on the back of the card immediately so that you don't forget. Follow up within two days.<p>If you want to hand something out besides your card consider either or both of these:<p>1. 3x5 card with a pain question on one side (and two or three sentences on how you address) and a short 2-3 sentence backgrounder on the other. This is still small enough to fit in folks pocket. Bonus: preparing this also prepares you for small talk / networking conversations where you need to succinctly describe what you do.<p>2. An article as a ""leave behind"" instead of your slide deck, a good slide deck is incomplete without the spoken presentation, and article can be complete stand alone.<p>There are more than 50 sponsors: research each one's website and determine if there are potential synergies between their offerings and yours.

Yeah, I am sure there are exceptions, but in the couple of opportunities I had to hear their stories (not in a club - in a coffee shop, just FYI), they agreed that the way you lose their respect is to enter the strip club in the first place. I remember watching an interview of another ex-stripper online who said much the same thing.

781098,comment,780688,780688,0,0,maxniederhofer,,,"I really like their approach of trying to solve real-money trading by PLEX (Pilot License Extensions). Essentially a PLEX buys you 30 days of game time. People can buy a PLEX and trade it for in-game items. PLEX only has a value for people who want to play the game because you can't convert a PLEX back into real money. All the economic value is kept inside the EVE ecosystem, allowing for moderate but manageable inflation, hardcore players (i.e. the guys without jobs) to play the game for free and somewhat more casual players (i.e. the guys with jobs) to attain some items using cash. Brilliant.",1251065246

Basically, this means that all that the company gets from the VC is a loan, in return for a part of the company.

Interestingly, the quotes around your query are critical. Omit them, and you get the same junk I did.<p>I once heard a guy from Google say that quotes around search queries are sort of the nuclear option of search, i.e. they see it as a failure if the user has to resort to quotes.

When there's a huge demand around a specific time/location there are ways to make that work pre-Airbnb, ranging from Craigslist to event-specific forums. That has happened for many years at the Olympics, for example. I've never gone to an Olympics myself, but many of the people I know who've gone have rented out apartments or rooms from random individuals, usually finding them on Olympic-related forums (it can be even better if you can find someone with similar sports interests to you as a host, e.g. on a forum dedicated to Olympic swimming).<p>I see Airbnb as more revolutionary for just normal travel, where previously the discovery/matching problem for that scattered demand and supply was insurmountably high.",1347000516

4487842,comment,4487462,4487773,1,0,michaelsbradley,,,"I'm not sure about a format just yet, but I'm fairly certain it would be a superset of edn (as opposed to imposing it on ""plain old edn""). The <i>Document Format</i> spec for Collection+JSON is probably not a bad starting point:<p><a href=""http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/format/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/format/</a><p>Seems like it could readily be adapted to edn syntax. But I find myself drawn to the RDF concepts underlying JSON-LD, and wonder if the C+J and LD ideas could be melded together.<p>A solid exploration of the larger concepts involved in hypermedia controls can be found in Mike Amundsen's recent book:<p><i>Building Hypermedia APIs with HTML5 and Node</i><p><a href=""http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020530.do"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020530.do</a><p>The basic idea is that, per Fielding, HATEOAS is an aspect of REST that shouldn't be ignored. Standardized media types with well-defined hypermedia controls allow clients that understand those standards to make state transitions without having to ""know other rules"" that aren't contained in the representations themselves.<p>Our web browsers do this all the time when we click on links and submit forms that we find in web pages. Based on the X/HTML standard, ours browsers (hypermedia clients) know what to do with links and forms, i.e. how to initiate the appropriate state transitions (build and run GET/POST requests) based on the markup semantics.<p>Now, if a client is driven programmatically (i.e. not by a human reasoning about the appearance and purpose of a form-button labeled ""login"", etc.) then you need a bit more besides links and forms. This is where attributes like ""rel"" (for `a` and `link`) become important. There's been a lot of work in that area, e.g. Microformats and RDFa, among others.",1346997721

4487840,comment,4483710,4487757,2,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>But the status quo seems to me like a situation in which an entrepreneur can't start an honest corporation without putting his kids' college savings at risk of highly unpredictable fraud loss.</i><p>And to add insult to injury, <i>that</i> kind of risk is entirely the fault of the payment industry itself, for failing to implement sufficiently robust security measures. And yet, the merchant typically carries the risk, not the payment industry.<p>Perhaps any compulsory refunds should be classified as either based on fraud or based on dissatisfaction, and the card payment services should be required to indemnify the merchant against fraudulent ones provided that the merchant has followed the recommended security steps before completing the transaction.<p>In fact, I've noticed recently that a few payment services are offering to eat chargebacks based on claims of fraud if an on-line transaction included a test such as Verified by Visa, so this situation may be starting to change, albeit rather slowly.<p>For losses based on dissatisfaction, it's probably as fair as anything practical to make the merchant carry the risk, but it is extremely unlikely that this kind of chargeback would result in a sudden spike in refunds a long time after the initial payments. It seems reasonable to handle this case via a level of retained funds commensurate with the observed level of loss.<p>That really only leaves catastrophe-scale events, such as a product having a fundamental flaw where everything dies at midnight on 1 January 2000. But in that case, either the business has the funds to cover the loss (in which case there's no problem and the card services can go to court if the merchant doesn't pay back what they owe) or the business is toast (in which case unless it's a very small business, probably no individual who gave a personal guarantee could do much to cover the costs anyway, and if it was a very small business, there's no substantial danger to the card service companies on the relatively rare occasions that they have to write the client off and eat the loss themselves).<p>In short, to the individual a piercing agreement may be an existential threat to their way of life, but such agreements make little real difference to the card companies in cases where the problem is not essentially their fault anyway.",1346997645

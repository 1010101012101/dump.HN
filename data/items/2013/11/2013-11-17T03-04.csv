6747495,comment,6742780,6747039,3,0,malandrew,,,"Your analysis needs to take into account the social psychology of conformity on individual human behavior. If not one soul acts when the gravity of the situation is made known, then the likelihood of anyone acting remains low. However, the moment a single person acts, due to conformity (see results from any experiments carried out by Solomon Asch for data[0]), the likelihood that many people will act together goes up astronomically. Now, the question to ask to determine if a single person will act is highly related to the presence of passengers on the plane that have been trained to take action, e.g. military personal, EMTs, first responders, Coast Guard, fire fighters, etc. The presence of one or more of these people on a flight greatly increases the chance of someone attempting to wrest control from any hijackers, and others quickly following suit.<p>Car accidents are always interesting because they often have the same dynamics, those who respond are those who have had even the most rudimentary training to respond. Almost everyone lacking such trainers waits for others to act. As someone trained to act, I&#x27;ve actually been in such a situation first hand as a victim and been the first to respond. I was in a vehicle traveling at ~45mph and another vehicle pulled out without looking. I t-boned her vehicle the moment my car came to a standstill, I whipped out my phone called 911 and immediately after getting off the phone with the 911 operator, I went to check on the other driver.<p>Trying to analyze people like economists do, considering people to be merely self-interested agents, doesn&#x27;t paint the whole picture. Many people in society are trained to act in a way contrary to what a simple simulation would suggest. Among 200 people on a plane, the likelihood that there are 2-3 such people trained to respond is pretty high, and at least high enough that a would-be terrorist has no way of knowing if they are lucky enough to have picked the rare plane where no such people trained to respond are present.<p>[0] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments</a>",1384660424

6747492,comment,6746882,6747453,1,0,TheZenPsycho,,,"Attaching an event handler to a dom node is the /only/ way to handle events. As for where to put the setTimeout variable, I would say best practice is just use underscore&#x27;s debounce function, and you avoid the question of where to store that variable altogether. (it&#x27;s kept inside the closure of a wrapped function. secretly. But you don&#x27;t really care where it is since all we are interested in is the external observable behaviour of the debounced function)<p>On a broader level, an interesting question is: when <i>is</i> it good practice to attach a variable to a DOM node? I would say very rarely except perhaps in the case where what you are doing is assembling some kind of interface widget out of HTML elements. Then storing information about the widget&#x27;s state with the dom node is what makes the most sense.<p>Since in the question, the task at hand is constructing an autocomplete widget, apparently from scratch without recourse to the many easily available robust and tested existing libraries, it does indeed make some sense to store the timeout state with the DOM node. If your goal is a robust reusable component, you want something that can cope with having many instances on a page. to do that and maintain the behavior of one on its own, you can either attach the state with the dom node, or create a framework that simulates doing that, but implements it in some other overly clever way.",1384660330

My point is simply that non-discrimination policies without tangible focus on economic wellbeing is meaningless and will have zero impact.<p>Yes, on average black population is at an economic disadvantage when compared to white. Yes, there are historic reasons for that. But the problem is not that they were disadvantaged, but that they stay disadvantaged, much of it through somewhat self-sustaining social processes.<p>What I mean by self-sustaining, in this case, is the cycles of criminal activities/violence many of these communities are gripped by. The three strikes law hurts these communities the most not because they are black, but because the economic situation is such that people are compelled to steal or commit other crimes. Not only that, but it is socially acceptable to be involved in criminal activity. Both make repeat offenses more likely.<p>On the flip side, the suburban voters are acting very rationally. It&#x27;s all in how you ask the question. &quot;Should a repeat rapist be prevented from hurting anyone else?&quot; Most people will answer yes. &quot;Should a person convicted repeatedly of serious violent crimes be prevented from hurting anyone else?&quot; Again, most people will answer yes.<p>Now, break these statements into what lawmakers and law-enforcement can actually implement, and you get something a long the lines of &quot;people that commit multiple felonies should be sentenced to life without parole&quot;. Then the same lawmakers start expanding what a &quot;felony&quot; is to include non-violent crimes, and so on... Everyone appears to be acting somewhat rationally, but the end result is a lot less clear cut.<p>What we really need to focus is changing the economic situation, then the cultural aspects will follow, and only then we will have fewer stories like this and fewer victims in general.",1384659278

Much idiocy has been put forth by people who are unable to understand basic layman&#x27;s toxicology/pharmacology.  Drugs have effects.  More of the substance has more of an effect.  Step functions where a little of a substance has zero effect, shifting to a major effect with a little more, are extremely rare.  It is never the case, for example, that a dose of ionizing radiation goes from &quot;not dangerous&quot; to &quot;dangerous&quot; suddenly - we may measure a low dose at 5 cancers per 100,000 and a high dose at 5,000 cancers per 100,000, but there is always presumed to be some effect.<p>And yet we have <i>media</i> organizations saying things like:<p>&quot;\nWashington (CNN) -- A common benchmark in the United States for determining when a driver is legally drunk is not doing enough to prevent alcohol-related crashes that kill about 10,000 people each year and should be made more restrictive, transportation safety investigators say.<p>The National Transportation Safety Board recommended on Tuesday that all 50 states adopt a blood-alcohol content (BAC) cutoff of 0.05 compared to the 0.08 standard on the books today and used by law enforcement and the courts to prosecute drunk driving.<p>The NTSB cited research that showed most drivers experience a decline in both cognitive and visual functions with a BAC of 0.05.\n&quot;<p><i>Of course</i> we have a decline in cognitive and visual functions - that&#x27;s what a depressant <i>does</i>.  At any dose.  So long as we have drinking as a major societal institution, and we have bodies that slowly process alcohol, and we have an automotive-mobile culture, there is some <i>nonzero</i> number of deaths we will prefer to tolerate every year due to drunk driving, whether it&#x27;s 1,000,000 or 10,000 or 100.<p>---<p>While there may be some distribution of how well people deal with a certain degree of drunkenness, the basic objective fact that we possess to measure impairment is BAC.  Limits vary geographically and through history - in the US we have had experience with thresholds at 0.05%, 0.08%, 0.1%, and 0.15% in various eras and places.<p>A BAC of 0.01% doesn&#x27;t significantly harm anyone - it is barely detectable.  A BAC of 0.05% poses some minor statistical increase in danger, and is generally the minimum people seek out to &#x27;get a buzz&#x27;.  A BAC of 0.1% indicates moderate impairment - about what you thought, several times more dangerous.  It&#x27;s only when you get to a BAC of around 0.2% that it becomes 20x more dangerous.  At a BAC of around 0.3% and up, on the other hand, one generally loses consciousness.  Death from alcohol intoxication (assuming no complications) occurs at an average of about 0.45% BAC (that is the approximate LD50).",1384658116

6747378,comment,6745884,6746967,4,0,throwawaykf,,,"There is a school of thought that details of an internal network topology should not leak out [1] (ostensibly because obscuring that has security benefits), and so NATs should be used even if each machine can have a unique IP address. Even though I worked on P2P apps and NATs were the biggest pain point, I do kinda feel the same... Leaking internal details make me squeamish even if I can think of no obvious risks. I think there is a real chance that home routers will also NAT by default even when IPv6 is common.<p>And you can bet corporate networks will be NATted. Not to mention data centers.<p>Another concern is Carrier Grade NATs. These are already being deployed within ISP networks to alleviate the IPv4 address shortage. I worry that once this infrastructure is in place, not only will it delay IPv6 adoption, but the adoption will be uneven, as ISPs with CGNs may hold off transitioning much longer. So even if there is a part of the Internet that is all IPv6, the rest of it might still be behind CGNs, and to connect arbitrary peers we&#x27;d still have to deal with NATs.<p>1. <a href=\"http://lwn.net/Articles/452293/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://lwn.net/Articles/452293/</a>",1384657761

If you haven&#x27;t come across a situation where you need to wait a period of time before initiating some event, you simply haven&#x27;t coded much. If someone else had just nailed the question in the interview before him than‚Äîhoop or not‚Äîthey&#x27;ve proven a skill he hasn&#x27;t.<p>Even if we ignore this, the &quot;What Really Happened&quot; area sounds like he only admitted he doesn&#x27;t know, and worse, that he <i>doesn&#x27;t know how to proceed</i>. Another comment above asks if one small set back is really a deal breaker, but in my opinion, not attempting to overcome a problem you haven&#x27;t seen before shows more about a candidate&#x27;s abilities than simple knowledge. Prove you can find a solution when all you have is a basic idea of the problem. Take a hint and run with it. (The interviewer gave the method name as a hint!) Google the answer.<p>This post hints that the position was closer to entry level, so I would suspect that curiosity and autonomous problem solving are fundamental requirements for the role. When you&#x27;re green a lot is going to be brand new, so you have to be able to learn on the spot and run with it.",1384657745

While I&#x27;d be willing to consider evidence to the contrary, I think this is a false correlation. Observing that anonymous comment threads tend to have more swill than social network threads says nothing. People act more like they would in real life on Facebook because Facebook has always tried to tie your online identity with your meatspace identity. Slapping real names on YouTube accounts makes them easier to stalk, and possibly easier to humiliate outside of the site, but it doesn&#x27;t stop them from being a conglomerate of barely-literate human beings who are strangers to almost everybody and will rarely interact with each other more than once.",1384657667

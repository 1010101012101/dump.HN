If you don't like it, dont come back.<p>In the same breath, if your on a site who decide at their will, without notification, that they want to rewrite product links to be affiliate links then I don't see why that is a problem - you are in THEIR domain. Providing it is clearly labelled in their TOS/Privacy Policy (of course). Its their prerogative, they dont exist solely with the purpose of facilitating your leisure/browsing hours, they are there to make money and unfortunately for the haters, Affiliate's are a fantastic way to make money.<p>I could understand if by some black magic they managed to then follow you around, rewriting links on other sites (I know this isn't possible) then people would have a reason to be miffed, I just see this as them monetizing their asset in a smart, non-obtrusive way.<p>Best of luck to both biz's.",1328709421

I think the crux of it is that it removes the <i>option</i> to access content... key word <i>option</i>.  If it's not the default, etc, that's fine... but you're placing the disadvantages of Flash over my ability to get to content I feel is important.  The ""no Flash for you"" argument hinges on saying ""our opinion that Flash is bad is more important than your opinion that you want to see the content you desire, even if it's not available in other formats"".

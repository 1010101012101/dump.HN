Well, government certainly can't do anything right or efficient if laws are written specifically to make it less efficient.  There are plenty of examples of Democratic politicians doing the bidding of vested interests for pay so I'm not claiming this is a problem for only one of the parties.<p>I wonder if the system would be less corrupt if the difference in pay/lifestyle from the top 1% to the top 0.1% were much less.  That is, if incomes were taxed at a much higher rate.  Going from a $200000 salary to a $2.5 million salary and keeping most of it is too much of an incentive for corruption.<p>I suspect that countries with the least amount of corruption have the least amount of income inequality.",1323532657

You should have iterated the idea with potential users (not just people who like the idea but are committed to using your product) before building it (at least ideally). I assume you didn't do this step from the way you made it sound.<p>Next, once you've gotten your MVP built, the next major step should be to get those users together to try your MVP during a private beta. This will help you fix bugs, adjust the MVP, and add features that the early adopters suggests. This should be the step you guys should be working on now. You shouldn't be out there trying to do a massive launch, but rather find a small group of people willing to try your product out.<p>Once you're done with that, then you potentially will try to get the word out to the masses and garner traction. Without social proof, without any form of traction (user or revenue), and being first time entrepreneurs, you'll have a much harder time raising capital if you don't get at least have the above done (albeit anything is possible).

3337749,comment,3337445,3337618,6,0,shadowfiend,,,"A few things to keep in mind. First off, the President appoints judges and justices, but in no way does he guide them once they've been appointed. When appointing these positions, the best the President can do (keep in mind they have to be confirmed by 2/3s of the Senate) is to try to pick someone who will not undo years of jurisprudence the President agrees with. Once the position has been appointed, the President no longer has any control, and I believe the evidence says Presidential initiatives have both been supported and torn down at various times by the same judges and justices they've appointed.<p>Additionally, the President is the leader of his party,but there is a significantly greater power to being the leader of the Republican party than that of the Democratic party. This is because the Democratic party is much more fragmented and pulls from a much wider pool of underlying ideas than does the Republican one, so legislators representing their communities will be much tougher to keep on a coherent party message on a given issue. This is why, despite the strong hand he was dealt, the healthcare package passed by the Congress was lackluster at best: the Republican support was uniformly against it, while the Democratic support was extremely fragmented.<p>The President gets a free pass insofar as one has to look and see whether he's used the tools at his disposal to try to guide things in the right direction. You don't judge him by the result, but by whether he did what he could to influence it correctly, no matter what the result ultimately was. In the specific case of lobbying/corruption, mind you, I think (a) the evidence is unclear-to-negative and (b) Obama quickly decided to lose the focus on that in favor of trying to pull out of the recession as best he could and passing some of his legislative priorities. Whether the latter was a good decision or not is definitely up for debate. In a similar vein, the civil rights verbiage from the campaign for the most part went into a tailspin within a year of his taking office.",1323532504

The 500th most powerful supercomputer can do 51 Teraflops.<p>If the authors actually tried to measure Linpack scores on their cluster, they'd find that peak performance would be much worse than the 12 teraflops they're claiming as ""peak"" performance.

Look at Nokia's Lumia phone. It is clear that Lumia's design is iPhone-inspired, but it is in no way a slavish imitation, unlike a certain device from Samsung. In fact I just love how Lumia's stylish and ergonomic design makes a compelling argument against the rhetoric that ""a black rectangle with rounded corners is the only logical/possible design"".<p>A lot of people here are understandably worried about protecting smaller business owners from patent threats from established companies, especially using ridiculous/obvious patents for which prior art existed. I think that's a genuine concern.

My first job out of school was doing exactly as the gp suggests at a national telecom.  Job-shadowing people in their day-to-day work, understanding their problems, and turning around web/desktop apps within days or weeks to solve their problems.  We had huge success.  We won an international award for what it's worth (Stevie Awards for Best Support Team).  We saved our company millions, and were one of the keys for the company to survive a big labour dispute.  Can you believe that previously, for a national telecom, all orders for corporate telecom solutions had to be gateway-checked by a single person?  We democratized stuff like that so that processes could be much more flat.  No need for requirements documents, no change control, complete freedom of creativity, complete freedom to decide what work to accept, etc.  I know how that's sometimes necessary for big projects, but for small high-ROI stuff, it was beautiful.<p>The other side of the story is that we ran into huge political problems.  Every day, someone was trying to kill our team because we were making the traditional IT groups look bad with our turnaround time and solutions that worked.  On the other side, we were automating things that people didn't want automated.  If we didn't have support from the CEO down through a specific chain of command, we would have been killed within months, if not weeks.  We didn't even call ourselves developers.  Our official position title was business analyst because then IT would bug us less.  We weren't even part of the official IT department because those guys couldn't get outside the box.  So we were just a small group of business analysts who tried to hide until we were too successful to hide anymore.  That's when the attacks really started coming.  And then we continued to be successful, and then they started trying to copy us instead.  Last I heard, that team's unfortunately been swallowed up by the bureaucracy now, and is a shadow of what it once was.<p>Fascinating experience.<p>edit:  added end of the story",1323531557

3337706,comment,3337357,3337357,3,0,bsaunder,,,"While I like the standardization afforded by REST, I frequently run into some artificial limitations that are imposed on the different request methods.  For example, I find that I would frequently like to pass structure information in a GET that would be more useful to send in a body (as afforded by a POST).<p>One prime example relevant to this article would be a GET that was effectively a query by example.  So a client could basically submit a skeleton of the data that it would like.<p>This would let a client ""go deep"" on some portions of the structure and shallow on other aspects.  Imagine the following GET request for that calorie counting Android App in the post:<p><pre><code>  GET /orders/432544\n  { ""toppings"": \n    [{ ""calories"": """"}]\n  }\n</code></pre>\nWith a response that would be:<p><pre><code>  200 OK\n  { ""toppings"":\n    [ { ""calories"": 100 }\n    , { ""calories"": 25 }\n    ]\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThis would give any client the ability to ask for exactly what it wanted with different depths to the structure if necessary.  While you could serialize that into a URL, that seems like a kludge.  I think in general, the HTTP methods made sense for their original design, but as we move on to building more flexible, integrated data system, a more powerful flexible API mechanism may be warranted.",1323531037

Bich improved on Biro's invention, mainly in ink and process, but the classic ""Bic Biro"" had a rounded hexagonal cross section (which meant the pens wouldn't roll off desks, evn when separated from their lids) not the cylinder of the more modern pen shown in th article. Is this obvious? I can't find out if this design was patented, but I would be surprised if it weren't.<p>I realize that it's annoying that what seems like such an obvious and simple design might turn out to be protectable under IP law. Certainly Apple has produced many seemingly more clever and inobvious designs that have turned out to be less easy to protect.<p>If you look at the kindle fire it's a rounded rectangle with a flat screen. It supposedly represents the first credible threat to the iPad. Is Apple suing? The kindle fire is obviously a lot like the iPad for the kinds of reasons usually raised, but it's not a slavish imitation of the iPad. It's not rounded in the same way. The home screen doesn't feature an arrangement of icons designed, superficially to resemble the iPad home screen. And so on. It's perfectly possible to create a tablet with rounded corners that isn't weirdly identical to the iPad. It's perfectly clear to anyone who has watched Samsung over the years that they're the Burger King of consumer electronics. They let the market leader do the R&D and then slavishly imitate their successes. If someone behaved this way in elementary school you'd call them a cheat and move a desk away from them; getting caught doing it in academia should end your career (but before you get caught it might get you tenure), but it's dandy in business.

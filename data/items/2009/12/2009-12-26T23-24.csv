It's better to figure out something won't work than to go with something doomed to failure. But it's even better to iterate that initial idea to something that people actually want. I do think that if you are trying to tackle news/journalism that 6 months is not a long time at all to declare failure; there are so many different possibilities for applications and companies.",1261871868

To do this, one of three things needs to occur.<p>1) Another round of quantitative easing (Fed increases the money supply)  This will lead to a dollar collapse, or at the very least, a severe dollar devaluation, which is generally not good for the economy.<p>2) Fed raises interest rates.  With higher interest rates, more people are willing to buy treasuries, and so, there's more money coming in to pay the bills coming due in 2010.   Higher interest rates are generally not good for the economy, particularly if it's already sick.<p>3) US Government engineers a stock market collapse, to send people scurrying to the safety of treasuries (and thereby allowing government to borrow what they need to).  Of course, stock market collapses are generally bad for the economy.<p>So, in summary, I'd say they are predicting that the U.S. economy will have a rough 2010.",1261871474

Current detection technologies can't really detect explosive substances, except for the X-ray machine, but the best it can do is tell you the density of the materials in question, not necessarily what type of explosive it is.  So running your shoes through the machine makes sense, as enough dangerous solid explosive can be packed into the sole of a shoe.<p>Liquid explosives are extremely unstable.  The explosive power is probably not enough to blow up a plane, but it can definitely injure or kill many people or set fire to the plane.  Plus, no machine exists to distinguish explosive liquids from non-explosive liquids at the scale that an airport requires.<p>For the curious, I'll just briefly list some of the detection systems that are out on the market, and what their capabilities are:<p>- Metal detector<p>- X-ray machine - Densities of materials<p>- Ion Mobility Scanner (eg. Puffers or Swipers) - Trace explosives detection, but easily confused by other nitro compounds such as hand cremes, fertilizer, and uh..jet fuel.<p>- Millimeter Wave Scanner (eg. Whole Body Scanner) - Anomaly detection (eg. can penetrate clothing), but cannot identify explosives.<p>- Terahertz Imaging - Can penetrate clothing and can identify materials, including explosives, but can be blocked by water and hasn't reached commercialization.<p>- Other wavelength imaging - Our group uses UV light and can detect trace amounts of explosives, but does not penetrate clothing. It's only a surface technique.",1261871247

I'm always VERY careful to completely empty my bag after I accidentally brought a knife into the security area once a few years ago in my camera bag (which they found of course, but didn't give me much trouble about. I always keep one in my camera bag for cutting tape, wires, tree branches in photo shoots, opening packages, etc)- however I didn't check my coat this time as I was rushed. Opps.<p>Anyway, I took lockpicks through. Of course they noticed them in the x-ray machine. The guy was super nice about it. He was like, ""What are these?""  and I responded, ""Lockpicks. I just have them for practice on stuff and learning, I didn't mean to travel with them. I'm sorry if they are something that is contraband from carrying on airplanes and I totally understand if you have to keep them.""<p>The guy looked a little puzzled. ""Like you use to start or open a car?"". Now honestly I've never tried picking a car. I've tried picking my motorcycle when the key fell out once, but never a car. I say, ""I guess you could, but I've never tried it."" I was worried that he thought I was a car thief or something. He then said, ""Oh, well I've been having this trouble with my car ignition. Its really lose. I've always carried heavy keys and I think its broken. Do you know anything about fixing it?"" He was intrigued and just was curious. Not accusatory at all. I was kinda shocked. He looked at them and said, ""They don't look sharp or anything. They should be fine. We let people carry through small scissors which are more dangerous than these because if you break them in two they are two small knives if they are sharp""<p>He scanned them through the x-ray once more, and handed them to me and was asking a few other questions about good locksmiths in the area to fix his car. I apologized again for the trouble, but he said and this is the important part:<p>""Look, I used to work for a prison. The security here is a joke compared to real security at prisons. These wouldn't get through there, but we let all sorts of stuff through that would probably get someone killed in prison fights or would be instantly contraband there.""<p>I'd thought about this before, but the bluntness and understanding that he had behind this was a real shock to me. I'd never thought that the airports were secure- but compare them to an actual 'secure' environment like a prison and they seem wide open.<p>It is truly unfortunate that the higher ups at the TSA don't promote this guy to the top and have the same understanding as him. You're not making a secure place with these practices- you're making placebo.<p>If we wanted real security EVERYONE would probably need cavity searches and no one could take anything at all onboard.

They have each developed an interesting and innovative software platform, which can be used in a number of useful ways and in various computing fields, but both platforms are still a bit rough at the edges and need further development before they could be used standalone.<p>For one of these startups we have defined the first product which will take advantage of the underlying platform; it will be using only a portion of the platform's capabilities, but is a) easy to build and b) covers a currently trendy area. Since one of my duties is to pitch to investors (let's say that we're past the ""friends and family"" phase and are looking for more professional investors), I'm wondering what to give greater accent to: the platform of the product. I'm afraid that if we stress the platform, the pitch might end up being too vague as there are numerous potential uses of that technology; on the other hand, if we go with the product it might seem overly simplistic and its greatest strength -- the platform -- might end up unnoticed. It's sorta kinda like inventing a new type of car engine in early 1900's: if you just show the engine people would be asking what it is good for; but if you built the vehicle to showcase the engine people might get lost in the details of the vehicle and miss the specific advantages of the new engine. Any suggestions/ideas/opinions?",1261868696

Scheme, python, or lisp are pretty good places to start.<p>(2) You don't really know a technology unless you have a project you want (<i>want</i>) to finish.  Before then, there's no motivation to go deeper.",1261868558

I've been paying sales tax at Amazon forever (I'm in KY) and it hasn't discouraged me from using any of their services. I go with Amazon for the convenience and the fact that I can often find free shipping offers from them on many itmes, which more than offsets the amount of sales tax I have to pay.<p>That said, I could be entirely wrong. :) If I didn't live in a small town that was at least an hour away from all major retailers other than walmart, I might be using Amazon a lot less.<p>It would be interesting to see some statistics on their sales in states that pay sales tax vs. states that don't, provided they also took into account the overall spending patterns of the people in those states.",1261868483

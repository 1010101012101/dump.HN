3642989,comment,3642252,3642252,8,0,derrida,,,"It's a political hack, it's making the point that it is easier to synthesise pseudoephedrine by buying crystal meth (the reason pseudoephedrine is so heavily restricted) than it is to go out and buy pseudoephedrine. It's an effort to change the law. That's the 'hack'. Chemistry enthusiasts will have to judge if it has been successful on its claims about the method outlined or, rather, if the hack is in fact exploiting our expectations that journals generally say intelligent and correct stuff, so the claims made in this journal article are correct. If we are either deceived by it being correct and cheap chemistry, or if we believe the claims within the article, the hack works (it's intent being to change absurd legal controls surrounding pseudoephidrine, not necessarily to show how to synthesise pseudoephidrine). It's necessary for the hack to work, to change our beliefs. If it does this with the truth, all the nicer.<p>This is a classic - even if the claims in the paper are bullshit. :-)",1330433831

Most problems they label as illnesses are legitimate issues people have that need resolution not pills.<p>I had severe allergic reaction to shrimp. Ended up at the ER where I was treated with Epinephrine, Prednisone and Diphenhydramine (Benadryl administered directly to bloodstream though).<p>Guess what, I had serious panick attacks for another2  days. When the following day I showed up at the ER, I was told by a Doctor who originally treated me day before that I clearly have mental issues because this reaction shouldn't last so long. Psychiatrist didn't even ask questions and prescribed me anti-depressants. Obciously, anxiety diminished on its own next day. FDA.GOV confirms that all 3 medications I was given may cause anxiety (severe) and panick attacks. Including benadryl that does cause anxiety in me. This was widely studied and is believed to be caused by liver enzymes. So, all in all I had never had mentall issues before, never had issues after. But had 3 days of panick attacks and severe anxeity causeb clearly by medication. Hey, but I'm considered depressive, anxious now. It is in my medical records. Just amazing how fast they are to label you and how difficult it is to clear the record. All result of ignorance, but what can I do?

3642969,comment,3642401,3642401,19,0,cmurphycode,,,"The generally accepted wisdom in the running community (backed up by a couple of studies, but what isn't these days) is that HIIT is great for making big gains in the short term, but that the gains will peak before a program with proper high volume base training would.<p>In fact, the way most people are encouraged to train is to build up to some decent mileage (at least 20 miles per week) and then mix in speed work, which varies from simply faster runs, to Fartlek (speed play), to intervals.<p>Knowing this, it becomes obvious why runners fall in love with speed work: they might do a ""traditional"" training plan and run slow, high volume for 3 months, and see minimal but steady gains. Then they do 3 weeks of sprints and make huge gains! Awesome! But those gains were a reflection of the base work. Think of it like sharpening an old, abused, rusty knife: you don't go right for the fine grit. First, you grind it down, then successively apply finer grits. The knife won't cut a tomato without the fine grits, but if you skipped straight to them, you'd be at it forever.<p>The other reason one should be wary of HIIT is the increased risk of injury. Especially in running, if you go from couch to sprinting, you're highly likely to be injured. It is important to run slow and often, so that your tendons, ligaments, and joints (not just your muscles and heart!) are ready for the strenuous demands of running.<p>Similar concepts are often spoken of in weightlifting, where you are encouraged to start with just the bar and work up.",1330433208

Typically the 3rd party merchants here in Euroland are literally only a few bucks cheaper on a 3-digit purchase but they take (much) longer to ship, you have to pay for return-shipping and often you need to pay for shipping and handling as well. On top of that, they often go with the absolutely cheapest possible shipping option to squeeze out a few more bucks and that often fails delivering to a DHL Packstation (<i>a popular fully automated self-service post box here</i>), which is a major annoyance. I specifically order to my Packstation so I do _NOT_ have to deal with the horror and pathetic sight that is a German post office in the evening.<p>On top of that I am starting to really, really hate the amazon market place because their product offerings are horribly unorganized, they list in lots of wrong but popular categories and they put something up as a different product despite the same product already being there at least twice.<p>Also I absolutely love ordering online and getting stuff in the mail so I decided to pay the I-dont-know 20 bucks a year for the Amazon Prime subscription and get free next-day(!) delivery on each and every order.

Do editors at The Atlantic and The Economist have intricate discussions about Medvedev vs Timoshenko to figure out Putin's actions?<p><pre><code>  From: ""Marc Lanthemann""\n  To: ""Alpha List""\n  Sent: Wednesday, September 14, 2011 1:48:33 PM\n  Subject: [alpha] INSIGHT - UKRAINE - Moscow-Kiev Spat - UA111\n\n  CODE: UA111\n  PUBLICATION: yes\n  ATTRIBUTION: STRATFOR sources in Kiev\n  SOURCE DESCRIPTION: A senior pro-western diplomat in Kiev\n  SOURCE RELIABILITY: B\n  ITEM CREDIBILITY: B\n  DISTRIBUTION: Alpha\n  HANDLER: Lauren\n\n  Yes, yes, the spat between Kiev and Moscow has been really fun to watch.\n  But Yanukovich may be overstepping his bounds with the Kremlin if he keeps\n  this up. He has already really ticked off Putina**who didna**t like him to\n  begin with.\n\n  You already pretty much know this storya**Putin never wanted Yanukovich in\n  power without a counter-balance to keep him in check. Putin knew\n  Yanukovich could win on his own, but wanted a super-majority in order to\n  solidify the Kremlina**s meddling in Kiev. He wanted that to be\n  Timoshenko, not because she is pro-Russian, but that she was the most\n  easily bought out of all the top politicians. Of course, this is what got\n  her in trouble and arrested.\n\n  But Medvedev has never liked Timoshenko, mainly because she gave him no\n  respect in any meeting and would only deal with Putin personally. Medvedev\n  made the decision that Timoshenko cana**t be put into power, so he made a\n  deal with Putin. Medvedev swore that he would keep Yanukovich in line if\n  Putin dropped his support of Timoshenko. Putin agreed in return for being\n  the one to draw up the list of new Ukrainians going into power in the SBU,\n  military, ministries, etc. Also that Russia would get the base extension\n  it had been pushing for.\n\n  So when Timoshenko and Yanukovich showed up in Moscow at the end of 2009,\n  the tandem broke the news to Yanukovich privately that they were willing\n  to drop support for Timoshenko if he would agree to Putina**s list of\n  demands. Yanukovich jumped all over it, naturally.\n\n  Now that Yanukovich is acting out, Putin has snapped the leash on Medvedev\n  to fix this. It is kind of a test for Medvedev. This is why the railing\n  against Ukraine has come from Medvedev, not Putin. Question is which lever\n  will Medvedev pull to get Yanukovich back in line.\n\n  --\n\n  Lauren Goodrich\n  Senior Eurasia Analyst\n  STRATFOR\n  T: 512.744.4311\n  F: 512.744.4334\n  lauren.goodrich@stratfor.com\n  www.stratfor.com</code></pre>",1330431853

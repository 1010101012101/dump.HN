Also, we implemented the protocol twice, using two different software stacks, and checked we came up with the same answer. You can probably convince yourself that WarpWallet works as advertised with about 10 lines of Python. We did something like that when building it.<p>Because we encourage running this thing on an airgapped machine, you mainly need to convince yourself that we&#x27;re generating keys as advertised (and not from a small known pool).

How the hell are you suppose to know what the right choice is? Maybe DWYL could be more realistically stated as &quot;don&#x27;t do what you despise&quot;, but even then, it&#x27;s questionable.<p>I mean, its definitely popular because it &quot;works&quot; in so many ways. It tells you to seek employment doing things that you at least enjoy, and also tells you that if your employed doing something you don&#x27;t enjoy, you -should- find a way to make it enjoyable, and even implies that things you love will be able to sustain you. It&#x27;s brilliant! And by sheer weight of repetition, it goes from something prescribed or something to challenge yourself towards (this is something that everyone has to deal with) to normative (this is something that is normal). And really, it&#x27;s that switch that&#x27;s most insidious.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to suggest that we all try reach a bit further than maybe we can grasp. It&#x27;s another thing to create an atmosphere where everyone thinks that everyone else is capable of grasping anything they reach, and they&#x27;re the only one who quite make it.<p>I am in my final year of engineering school right now (final term!). My class is pretty tight, and there&#x27;s a lot of &quot;class love&quot; statements flying around. I do not quite feel so strongly. I&#x27;m the type of person who is pretty confident in their abilities, but a little insecure in who I am. And these &quot;class love&quot; statements ding away at me everytime. It&#x27;s a totally innocent statement, and those who are saying it (probably) totally believe and feel it, and objectively, it&#x27;s probably even true. But I don&#x27;t really feel it, and everytime I hear and read it, it dings away at me a bit. What did I do wrong? Why don&#x27;t I feel this? They&#x27;re not overtly trying to hurt me (they might not even know that), but it&#x27;s happening. And this is even with the self-awareness that these types of statements are kinda silly, and kinda toy-like.<p>I&#x27;m going to be a lucky person (at least for the shortterm), and am going to go work in an environment where I&#x27;ll enjoy (if not love) my work.

But as it grew larger and larger and finally ascended to power by means of one last vulgar corruption, the abscess erupted and defiled the whole body.<p>This caused the majority of its previous opponents to hide themselves. German intelligentsia took refuge in holes in the cellar like Solanaceae, hiding from light and the sun, gradually suffocating. And now we are facing the end. Now it is a question of mutually coming to our senses, of mutually keeping one another informed. We must always keep these things in mind and allow ourselves no rest until the last man is convinced of the utmost necessity of his battle against this system. If a wave of insurrection surges through the country, if “it is in the air,” if many join us, then this system can be cast aside with one last mighty effort.

Why do you permit this autocrat to rob you of one sphere of your rights after another, little by little, both overtly and in secret? One day there will be nothing left, nothing at all, except for a mechanized national engine that has been commandeered by criminals and drunks.

It is impossible to lay the groundwork for the overthrow of this “government,” much less to effect its overthrow as soon as possible, if one opposes it alone in the manner of embittered loners. This can only be accomplished through the cooperative efforts of many unshakable, energetic people – people who are unified regarding the means necessary to achieve their goal. There are not a great many choices we have regarding the means to use; one and only one is at our disposal – passive resistance.<p>[..]<p>Clearly, it is impossible for us to give every individual specific guidelines for his personal conduct. We can only allude to general issues. Everyone must find his own way to realize resistance.<p>Sabotage in armaments factories and other businesses vital to the war effort. Sabotage in all assemblies, rallies, festivities, organizations that were breathed into life by the National Socialist Party, prevention of the smooth operation of the war machine (a machine that operates only for one war, one that focuses on the preservation and maintenance of the National Socialist Party and its dictatorship). Sabotage in all scholarly and intellectual realms that exist for the continuance of the current war – this whether it be in universities, colleges, laboratories, research facilities, or technical offices. Sabotage at all cultural events that could possibly exalt the “prestige” of fascists among the people. Sabotage in all branches of the fine arts that have the least connection to National Socialism and serve its goals.

The mainframe database was not directly accessible to the webapp platform, so instead a session was opened to the mainframe over telnet, and the web application itself issued commands over that telnet session, parsed the terminal output, and dynamically generated a web UI that displayed the data or form fields or what have you.<p>Scraping these days may more often be a means of extracting data to an offsite cache/database, but ad-hoc on-demand scraping is consistent with the definition.<p>Regardless, this doesn&#x27;t really matter.

Mobile browsers that reformat pages on the fly to optimize their display on a small screen are &quot;scraping&quot;.<p>Ad-hoc user-initiated scraping of this sort is really no different than just browsing the web directly. So whether one wants to argue that &quot;scraping&quot; is or isn&#x27;t happening here, it hardly matters to whether this is ethical, and should not matter to whether it is legal (although on that topic, I&#x27;m guessing different judges would see it differently).",1390146435

You won&#x27;t find good engineers willing to work for non-founder equity. The people who work for 0.1% of a mediocre startup are not good and you&#x27;ll have to hire $200-400/hour freelancers to fix their work after you fire them. (One startup offered me $275/h to fix its Rails app and I&#x27;ve never even used Rails.)<p>Second, the quality of startups is just not there. Granted, 97% of the startups in the Valley are total garbage as well, because the VCs have no taste or insight, but at least SV has that other 3%. New York doesn&#x27;t. Most of the founders are people who failed out of finance but managed to snag enough connections (as a consolation prize) to raise VC.<p>Third, there are startups that luck their way into a few good engineers for a little while, but in NYC, they never keep them. There&#x27;s a lot of title inflation in NYC (Senior Engineer by 24, Managing Data Scientist by 26) but the people with any ambition leverage their inflated titles into better positions in finance (starting around $300k) or at companies like Google and Facebook.<p>New York is the place where you use startups to get better Wall Street or Google jobs.",1390146287

7084708,comment,7084381,7084603,5,0,equalarrow,,,"Yah, I got the same feeling too. Like, the author needs to step back and take a deep breath.<p>First off, I&#x27;m not an elite. Second, I don&#x27;t think &#x27;elites&#x27; (whomever they may be) are saying this so people become reality distortion-ified and just zombie off to devalue themselves making straw birdies because they love stick art the most. That&#x27;s silly.<p>Instead, I look at some people like Elon Musk or Richard Branson or Jobs or Peter Diamandis as ones that have made their own way previously doing or currently doing what they love. For me it seems, once you clear away the FUD, that you are confident on your own self, realize you have little time on this planet, and therefore you see no value in wasting your time helping someone else pursue their dreams.<p>I must also add that this is not just captains of industry either. There are so many doctors, educators, and scientists around the world that I&#x27;m sure love what they do and actually do make an impact. I would encourage anyone to go on Youtube or Netflix, etc, and find a documentary about planning a mission to Mars or even launching a satellite. So many of these people think in terms of decades and it&#x27;s unbelievable that they can create machines, put them into space, and collect data that expands the understanding of all humanity. Any time I watch one of these, I am just blown away by the people who do this. They are truly on another level and thinking in terms of mankind and not just &#x27;me&#x27;. I don&#x27;t see any elitism or devaluing of ones labor or mental faculties <i>at</i> <i>all</i>..<p>I look back on my life and see two passions that emerged: music and programming. Luckily for me, both of these things are still highly lucrative and highly expressive. I also love astronomy, philosophy, physics, construction, cooking, and more. I could probably pick any one of these and really <i>love</i> doing them (I actually did for construction for a while - building physical things with your hands and tools is awesome).<p>For me, it all comes down to being in love with life. I bet if you ask any person that&#x27;s excelled in their industry (or like Branson and Musk) what they think about life, they will probably tell you it&#x27;s beautiful and they love it. Perhaps it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re successful, but it doesn&#x27;t matter. Your mind and your mindset are your greatest tools and channeling creativity and determination through a focused mind can lead to great things.<p>I wonder if the author loves writing? Critiques are fine, but does their story inspire anyone to do anything? Or is it just to help keep people in the same mindset of negativity and division? I&#x27;ve made some negative posts here on HN and I&#x27;ll be the first one to say, yah, dumb. Whether it&#x27;s a bad day or just getting wrapped up on others negativity, in the end it serves no purpose to actually bring about any change for good. It just joins the chorus of negativity and goes no where.<p>So, ultimately, I couldn&#x27;t disagree more with the author. If anything I think people that do what they love (calling them elite&#x27;s also just serves to simplify and brand as bad) and are successful doing it are some of the highest examples of what we could aspire to be or achieve.",1390146014

Recently, there have been ongoing protests (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_protests_in_Turkey"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_protests_in_Turkey</a>). There is a long history of police brutality in Turkey (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality#Turkey"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality#Turkey</a>), but at least recently we had thought that the police was largely supportive of the current political party (AKP), as key positions were manned largely by AKP supporters, placed there by the government.<p>Now, the government is having a conflict (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_corruption_scandal_in_Turkey"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_corruption_scandal_in_Turk...</a>) with the Gulen Movement (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BClen_movement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BClen_movement</a>), which they used to be buddy-buddy with, and now <i>no one</i> seems to trust the police anymore, not even the government themselves. The government has been sacking police chiefs and reassigning commanders all over the country, in an attempt to break up any Gulen supporters, and to seize power over the police again.<p>Looking at the Peelian principles, they&#x27;ve failed 1 many times before by taping over helmet identification numbers (<a href=""http://www.ataturk.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/same-story-Turkish-police-hides-their-id-numbers.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ataturk.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/same-story...</a>) and they&#x27;ve also failed 3 many times by engaging in cronyist tactics to avoid prosecution and accountability, even with evidence.<p>Looking over the principles of policing, they&#x27;ve failed #2 since there has been widespread condemnation of police brutality, and the force is still there. They failed #4 when riot police attacked a camp of sleeping peaceful protesters at 4am with tear gas and batons. They failed #5, since the police chiefs are appointed by the current political party, and thus are not impartial. #6 is the same as #4. #8 goes along with #5, and also when police have been seen attacking people of specific political leanings, or refusing to carry out orders to arrest people of their own political leanings.<p>My two main observations from all this are: First, like the judiciary, I believe the police force should also be completely isolated from the executive branch in terms of receiving orders and in terms of placement, hiring and firing of personnel. This prevents them becoming cronies of the current political power, and follows separation of powers.<p>Second, I believe that the police should be paid at least average salary (way above poverty level) and be required to have at least average education (not merely primary school education). Otherwise, it becomes difficult to have the sorts of people who can meditate on concepts like cronyism, whistleblowing, consent of the governed, blindly following orders, etc. It becomes easier to have the sorts of people who are poor and likely to accept bribes, politically fired up and filled with hatred, power tripping.",1390145057

I like that many sites have found a happy medium of including a few full paragraphs so you can get an idea if you&#x27;d like to continue reading the story.<p>And, no, ads embedded in the RSS feed itself won&#x27;t work.  You can&#x27;t do that with any ad network ads at all, you can only do that with manual referral links and the like.

Of course, that means you have to schedule your priorities, and some things won't make it as part of your life.  I've gotten my Bachelor's and Master's, and I never had to pull an all-nighter beyond my first semester.  I don't anticipate any all-nighters in the PhD program either.<p>One of the founders of the consulting firm that I worked for talked about never working past 6 or 7 PM.  He never ate out, and spent that time working.  You can always work more in your day without sacrificing your sleep and/or health.<p>At the same time, if we could all survive on less sleep, it'd be nice.",1187811526

Getting 1% more for you means 1% more for them, which means they may have a bias towards a low price that guarantees a deal.<p>Instead, you could try a larger commission of any sale price above X, where X is your low estimate of what your company is worth.<p>Edit: On the other hand, this tilts their incentive towards pursuing low-probability, high-payout situations. If someone is working with ten different companies, and they all compensate with this structure, getting one good sale and ignoring the other nine might be the most rewarding option. On the <i>other</i> hand, if there are nine companies with the ""percentage of sale price"" structure and one with ""higher percentage of price-minus-threshold,"" compensation, the latter will get all the attention. So this boils down to a brutal, Darwinian struggle to pay your sales guy the right way. At some point, structuring compensation might waste more time and effort than just selling the company yourself.",1187810694

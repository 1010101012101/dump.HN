I'm on to my second degree in Engineering at the moment but I remember back in my undergraduate days.<p>One thing you realise quickly when you're learning alongside mechanical, civil and electrical engineers is that if you get it wrong, people die. You can't afford to do quick solutions and fix it later. You have to get it right first time or lives could be at stake.<p>You could kill several people with any one of the dozen or so robots we have downstairs and poorly written software. When you realise that, it changes the way you program.",1204840799

130859,comment,130813,130813,0,0,scott_s,,,"Wonderful idea, but some of code I sampled is not what I would define as literate. For example, the singly linked list implemented in C has a linear time remove operation. While this operation is inherently linear with a singly linked list (you must find the previous node), you're not required to provide it as part of the interface. Personally, I think you shouldn't provide inherently inefficient operations in the interface to a data structure. That a particular operation is not implemented should be a hint to users that this is not the data structure they are looking for. Yes, I'm nitpicking, but this is supposed to be literate code, not just correct code.<p>And yes, I know, it's a wiki, so I can contribute, not just criticize.",1204839964

They buy too much equipment, far more than they need and run out of cash.<p>I've seen software projects crippled because the managers wanted to optimize for a later that never would happen.

It costs company B 100 dollars per ton of emissions eliminated.<p>Under a cap-and-trade system, company A can pay company B to reduce its emissions twice as much. This way you reduce the total amount of carbon dioxide pollution by the same amount as creating a tax would, but it is much more economically efficient.<p>My understanding is that this doesn't work under a carbon tax.

448248,comment,447873,448135,0,0,windsurfer,,,"Gimp does have 48-bit colour, ever since they added GEGL support.<p>And really, Pantone? You can't even accurately display Pantone on monitors, as Photoshop tells you if you've even used that feature. You only use Pantone colours for the printer.<p>Lastly, gamma? You can apply a gamma layer if you'd really like to. I don't see what the big deal is.
I guess I should conclude this by saying ""Stop spreading the FUD"" but you likely just heard those buzz-phrases from a friend and are repeating them here. Gimp is a wonderful and professional program that performs quite well for most people's needs. It most certainly is ""on the table"".",1232819734

Instead there is an <i>ftpfs</i> fileserver, and each FTP connection looks like a file system mount.<p>So, an application which needs access to files on another system can make one call to ftpfs, then return to using normal system calls to read and write files. With ftp, you would have to write an application to deal with the ftp client's api instead.<p>Presumably this advantage wasn't enough to get Plan 9 lots of users.",1232818887

448223,comment,447852,447852,0,0,ensignavenger,,,"The Founders warned of several ways that America could be turned into a Dictatorship.  Washington warned against political parties, calling them a form of despotism, which would, if left unchecked, lead to a worst form of despotism.<p>John Adams warned of the people voting to gain ""wanton pleasures, the capricious will"" and how that would cause a decay into anarchy.<p>As far as contradiction goes, there a a few areas that the Constitution is rather vague.  The place that comes to mind is the conditions under which a President can suspend Habeas Corpus.  Does Congress need to declare a national emergency first?  Or can the President do this himself? The Constitution does not provide much guidance on the federal courts.  This is also an area where we must be vigilant- to ensure that activist judges don't take over our country.<p>Other than a few areas of vagueness coupled with the fact that freedom requires a virtuous and moral people (Washington and Adams), who are ever vigilant in the defense of freedom, I don't know of any outright contradictions in the Constitution.  I suppose that is why it is part of the reason for it being amendable- so that future generations can give further guidance to their servants in government. (Which, in itself, could lead our nation into despotism).<p>Anyone who thinks that America could never turn into a dictatorship is fooling themselves, and would be wise to remain vigilant for freedoms sake.",1232817375
448222,comment,447435,447645,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"The Linux and BSD /proc is a pale imitation of plan9's, though. The most interesting ideas in plan9 are <i>inherently incompatible with Unix</i> because they're direct consequences of a <i>deep</i> overhaul of its security and file/namespace systems. (<i>Much</i> deeper than, say, adding sudo.) The free Unices' /proc filesystems attach to the global filesystem namespace, but on plan9 <i>each process can have its own</i>, and consequently what you can do with them is very different.<p>(FWIW, I <i>detest</i> the plan9 GUI, and am more interested in microkernel-based approaches such as in Minix 3, but getting into that in any real way is so far down my spare-time-fun list that I can only consider myself a curious onlooker.)",1232817335

The blogs get distribution and the sites get to have coverage they otherwise wouldn't.<p>This is why the whole ""the Times should curate all the news that's fit to display"" isn't the same as saying ""the Times should be a Digg clone"".

Polls are mostly effective on the 'less educated' and 'younger' demographics because most people worth their weight in anything know that it's just a pre-sell on someone's service (usually a scamming affiliate deal for ring tones or acai berry diet pills--which still makes some people millionaires).<p>Sure, you can create a gimmick similar to this one, but eventually people will want to see the real meat that tells them you can be trusted. If you want sign-ups there are <i>definitely</i> better ways on a per-hour or per-dollar invested basis. But it can be fun every once in a while.

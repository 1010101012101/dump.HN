Today, the children of this same generation have become the vital signs of success... Messages that speak to mothers about bettering the lives of their children, enriching their experiences, and creating more intelligent students can be seen in print and electronic ads."" (p. 75)<p>""In the 1990s yuppies shifted from spending on BMWs and Rolexes to their children. Children became their status symbol. Discretionary dollars switched from diamond bracelets to private violin instructors and university sports camps located seven states away."" (p. 82)<p>""A baby is not an accessory, exactly, but when you go outside with a baby, all eyes go to the baby. All of the sudden, it's not so important to spend as much money on yourself-- you spend on the baby."" (p. 201)",1213725576

It took me a while to understand that the 8 possible positions of the 'door' were the 'image' I was back-matching, and not the pattern of markings on the tunnel sides.<p>Also, as with other tests, the lack of a clear end (or even break) point is distracting, and makes it hard to compare runs, or even cleanly end a run at a standard length.<p>Not that whacked_new asked, but my overall estimation of cognitivefun: wow, you're generating a lot of games... but the overall comprehensibility of the site lags a bit. It's almost too much to absorb: where do I start? where do I stand? where do I go next?

Let's say that I'm convinced. But still, I would like to see some numbers, some carefully performed study that proves that such statements are right.<p>The problem is that they're very confirmation bias prone. People see a situation when the unit tests found a bug, but they don't see thousands of situaton when a bug wasn't found (""hey, it does not make sure your code is correct""), or pointless hours spent on rewriting the tests because the code changed significantly.

I personally feel that things have become more complicated as dress, in general, has become more casual but I'm not certain where the line lies between dressing down and disrespect.<p>I've always worn a suit to interviews in the Midwest and East Coast.  Once in New York (at a startup) I was told after being hired that they were concerned that I might be too stiff and strait-laced because of the suit.  I did get the job, however, and I would still wear a suit interviewing there.<p>On the West Coast, I might go with a suit for big companies, but I'd go button down and khakis for a small company or a startup.  It's a different culture.  Even the better restaurants rarely require formal attire, and I feel like a suit at some interviews would show an inability to grasp the cultural differences.",1213723839

In the early 20th century, trust companies could get around bank regulations, so they made riskier loans and grew faster, which worked well for a while. And hedge funds do that now -- many of them offer investment banking services (e.g. market making, debt structuring, direct investment/underwriting, etc.) without the same set of rules as regular banks.",1213723185

Controlling for differences in housing costs, an increase of $10,000 in the mean income for white households—about like going from South Carolina to California—leads to a 13 percent decrease in spending on visible goods. “Take a $100,000-a-year person in Alabama and a $100,000 person in Boston,” says Hurst. “The $100,000 person in Alabama does more visible consumption than the $100,000 person in Massachusetts.” That’s why a diamond-crusted Rolex screams “nouveau riche.” It signals that the owner came from a poor group and has something to prove.</i>",1213723082

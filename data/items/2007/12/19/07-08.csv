If the U.S. could've gotten away with it, who knows how many cultures we'd have nuked in pursuit of the American Dream.  <p>If anything, the spies who stole U.S. secrets inadvertently did the world a favor. Countries with a nuclear arsenal don't get invaded.<p>If Iraq had had nukes, we might have made major strides to become energy independent by now, instead of thinking it was easier to go in there, beat them up, and steal their oil.",1198050696

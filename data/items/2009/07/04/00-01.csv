As far as possible it is best to chunk down into lots of small tasks, keeping them as separate as possible.  That's one of the huge benefits of webapp world, you can maintain clean separation between functions.  I'll assume that you can't just build a complete new site, migrate the data and axe the old one.<p>If the database needs redesign, then you'll need a way to have transactions from the current database propagate through to the new one.  You don't want to break anything from the users' perspective while the redesign takes place.<p>If business rules need to be improved, then you'll have to make a decision whether to hit the current database or the new one.<p>Finally, the skin/usability part, keep it modular so that you can incrementally 'improve' your site.  You would call the business rule codebase from either the old or new part as appropriate.<p>Just look at Amazon, eBay, Google, etc.  They do continuous improvement without breaking much at any given time.  The key is to keep each change small, test and be able to revert if something goes wrong.  The reversion needs to be designed into every database change to minimise pain and lost transactions.  Of course, good project management is key, yes! even with just the two of you working on it.  ""Failing to plan is planning to fail."" :-)",1246669197

It's a pseudo-monopoly, where a small group of huge organizations have an implicit agreement which maximizes profit for all of them, and keeps everyone else out of the running... (Actually, it kind of reminds me of the two-party political system in the US)",1246668753

686764,comment,686641,686641,0,0,jdrock,,,"We looked at both shows, but no-starter on TC50 is that you can't have any public exposure before the event.  This seems pretty silly, in my opinion.  Most decent startups should have exposure before a singular event.  Banking on entry into one event is a poor decision (more foolish is banking on winning the competition, as that's where 99% of the publicity goes).<p>DEMO has less stringent requirements when it comes to the amount of publicity a startup has before the event, which, in my opinion, allows companies that aren't sitting on their butts when it comes to marketing have a nice big event at which to launch.<p>Edit:  I should also note that I've had one group of friends go to DEMO, and one get into the TC50 Demo Pit.  The former got a ton of exposure and new users.  The latter got no benefit in terms of attracting users.  Granted, this is a minimal sample size.",1246668507

686762,comment,686343,686514,0,0,Retric,,,"Considering we live in a quantum world that just means you can approximate the same thing in a non-quantum world.  It might not seem like a big deal, but thinking about earth's orbit in a pure Newtonian world is still wrong.  As is friction and wind resistance.<p>What I am trying to say is when someone says it works in a non-quantum viewpoint, they just mean you can approximate the first few decimal places without looking at QM.  But, saying it works is not accurate.",1246668235
686761,comment,686648,686648,0,0,frossie,,,"<i>First, even without payment, some folk will always record music, write software, make their feature films, do their own investigative journalism, occasionally even test their own drugs. You couldn't stop them if you tried.</i><p>While I agree with the broader sentiment, I do worry that you <i>can</i> keep people doing investigative journalism if you try. One thing a news organisation does for a journalist is act as a litigation shield. A single individual lacking the same protection is by nature less tenacious.<p>For example the badscience.net blogger/doctor (Ben Goldacre) wrote something about that hideous man who is getting South Africans with AIDS to stop taking their retrovirals and telling them that vitamins will cure their HIV infections. Goldacre got sued; but because he is a columnist for the UK newspaper the Guardian (a small-fry weekly columnist, not at all a newsdesk star) the paper backed him with their legal team and chased the bad guys off. Now if he was just a blogger with no media connection he probably would have stood down rather than deal with the legal fees.

And legal protection is expensive.",1246668235
686760,comment,686556,686589,0,0,jadence,,,"I have no idea how it'll help and suspect the author is confused about what a fraud alert actually does.<p>A fraud alert is simply a notice put on your credit files that creditors (before loaning you money, giving you a credit card, etc) will see.  Creditors are supposed to call the number you listed before extending credit to make sure you actually requested it.  A fraud alert's primary use to prevent identity theft and not to dispute items on your credit report.",1246668018

I mount a single share on Linux, Windows XP and OS.X systems and run the same Python program and have them run identically on all three systems, side-by-side.

Also, there are not many brick and mortars competitors in some areas of HI.<p>Of course, making a killing in AK and HI is not going to get them megabucks (the population is too small), but still, it's nice to have a pond where you are the big fish.<p>As for the service in general - sure, I'd use it, even if it was slightly more expensive than going to the store. Who wants to waste an afternoon shopping for toilet paper in Wal-Mart? Off the cuff, I'd say I'd be willing to tolerate a 5% price increase of my current cost for the convenience. Whether that is enough to defray their shipping, I don't know.",1246667368

I'm betting, even without knowing <i>anything</i> about the selection criteria of either or having ever spent any time at all looking at the companies launching at either, that TC50 produces more success stories.<p>Hmmm...actually I just checked out the DEMO site...there's an awful lot of old companies ""launched"" at DEMO (RealNetworks, really!?!?).<p>So, now I not only can't believe anyone would pay to present at DEMO, I <i>also</i> can't believe anyone would be willing to sit through that kind of crapfest.  It's just a bunch of ads.  Why would anyone, particularly someone representing millions or billions of dollars, want to sit through a bunch of ads?<p>I just don't get it, obviously.  Pretty swish website they have, though.<p>Edit: DEMO 09 appears to have had roughly half the participants as DEMO Fall 08.  Perhaps the rules changed, or perhaps folks made the connection that it's not the best use of time/effort/money.  I dunno.",1246666720

By ""self-sustaining"" I mean it requires no external input of users to continue to grow.<p>Using your model, let's say usersLosingInterest = 0 and 0 < viralCoefficient < 1.<p>How do you get exponential growth from this?  Each new user brings in a finite number of additional users, a function of viralCoefficient.  Call this number N.<p>This increases your growth by a factor of N, but it's still dependent on some outside source of users.  If I acquire M users then through my viral process I get an additional M*N users total.<p>Another way to think about it: if your viral coefficient is less than one then the viral growth of each cohort dies out.<p>I see nothing exponential here.  Am I missing something?<p>This point is mostly incidental to my two main points, though: outlining how the viral coefficient affects the cost of acquisition, and an argument for a hybrid strategy of accelerated but not viral growth.<p>What do you think of those points?",1239828672

564138,story,,,2,1,pierrefar,"Tell and Ask HN: Mobile sysadmin on the road",,"This is a topic that I've been exploring lately and thought I'd share my nascent knowledge and ask for your input.<p>Topic: server sysadmin while traveling without a laptop.<p>How I do it: My G1 is at the center of it all. Stored in it I have the phone numbers of my registrar, my host, and my good friends who can sub as admins.<p>On this phone, I have a 3G connection with excellent UK-wide coverage (I know of only real reception blackhole!) Worst case is a GPRS connection.<p>I use Pingdom to send me SMS alerts if something goes wrong with my web app's hardware. I've configured Pingdom to check the text of the page to see if MySQL is dead even if Apache is fine. This is very useful and an I think an overlooked feature.<p>The phone has an SSH client (ConnectBot) which is freely available in the Android Market. There is a profile saved (without a password in case the phone is lost) for the server. Logging in takes about 15 seconds with a 3G connection and about 25s on GPRS.<p>Hardware-wise: Although the screen is small, it's still very legible to have a fully functioning SSH terminal. The trackball is useful for scrolling around quickly. Also, I've found that having a hardware keyboard is immensely useful for typing commands into the SSH terminal. I can't imagine what it would be like with a soft keyboard.<p>Of course there is a very good browser that can render pretty much any website well. This gives me confidence that I can look up any necessary info relatively easily.<p>The server has nano and htop installed. I know how to use them well, and constantly learning.<p>In my wallet, I keep a little cheat sheet of various commands, keyboard shortcuts (like for controlling htop), and locations of important files (logs, config files, etc). It folds to be smaller than a credit card's dimensions and has lots of text in 10pt. Having this sheet is a great way to calm down and to save me time because I don't have to work from memory under stress. Unfolding it is like unfolding a battle plan you know you're going to win with.<p>I also have an sFTP client installed but never had to use it.<p>So that's me in a nutshell. What do you do? Any special tools/tips/tricks/setups?<p>Cheers.",1239828330

564125,comment,563712,563712,0,0,tom_b,,,"I think the worst part of this is that ""dull writing style is an academic survival skill because they think that is what editors want.""  I would argue with the author's assertion that ""dull, impersonal prose"" is not sought.<p>During my CS graduate school days, I saw several examples of technical article templates (for lack of a better word or phrase) that were specifically geared to follow the existing style of ""successful"" journal and conference submissions.  By template, I mean something that was almost pre-written where you could just drop your data/charts/algorithms/etc into the proper place and submit.  The use of such style templates did not leave much room to actually focus on the clear communication of ideas in a paper.  But there is so much pressure to publish and build up the CV that I kind of understand why people used that approach.  Combine that with the ""hack the paper together in a fury of writing in the last hours before FedEx can get the submission into the conference"" and I see where writing well is not as valued as simply producing publications.<p>Of course, I'm also commenting from the viewpoint of someone who received feedback on a tech paper along the lines of "" . . . I liked the words and flow . . . but . . ""  - paraphrasing here - the ideas aren't so good.  Not missing grad school so much these days.",1239827916

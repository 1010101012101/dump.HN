2611961,comment,2611281,2611653,0,0,achompas,,,"<i>One fair non-structural criticism, a weak, temporary criticism and two things billed as criticisms that aren't.</i><p>Actually, all of Adam's criticisms deal with the supply and demand of currencies, and they are pretty strong and damning as a result. In sum, the supply of Bitcoins is finite (despite a growing population) and the demand for Bitcoins depends on (a) confidence in Bitcoins as a currency and (b) consumers' ability to convert between Bitcoins and fiat money with little friction.<p>(1) Adam's point is not the unfairness of early adoption, but that early adopters control all the rents. Today's miners will control currency as it appreciates, but after a point (say, the supply of mine-able Bitcoins is exhausted) there is zero reason to demand Bitcoins unless they supplant paper money (very, very unlikely).<p>(2) I'm weak on my deflation theory, but I don't think the computer-purchasing analogy is 100% right. Instead of buying the computer with paper money, consider buying the computer with <i>gold bullions</i> during the commodity boom. Why buy that Macbook Pro with <i>x</i> bullions today if you can buy it with <i>x-y</i> bullions tomorrow? Adam isn't arguing that ""deflation is bad,"" but rather that the supply of Bitcoins as currency will dry up as their value appreciates.<p>(4) You can't hand-wave this away. Consumers have confidence in US dollars because the Federal Reserve and U.S. government can step in during a crisis and back people's assets. There is no similar guarantee for Bitcoins once something goes wrong.<p>(3) Why is convertibility not a systemic problem? Lack of convertibility falls out of all the previous points! Why accept bitcoins for cash if (a) they're not backed by a central authority, (b) almost no one else accepts them as money, or (c) they will be obscenely expensive once the supply dries up?<p>I can't believe Bitcoins have gotten this far. They're a currency accepted by almost no one as payment, guaranteed by no governing body, and artificially supplied as precious commodities without the benefits of said commodities (Bitcoin engagement ring? 24K Bitcoin watch?). They're a great theoretical exercise, but their real-world value will trend to $0 in the long run.<p>EDIT: barrkel gets to the point when he/she says ""the value of money is a product of supply and demand, no matter whether fiat or specie."" The fundamentals of Bitcoins are such that (a) supply will artificially dry up and (b) unlike precious metals/commodities, there will be little demand for Bitcoins aside from use as a currency (or a Ponzi scheme).",1307023013

Each currency itself has no intrinsic value and depends on ""marketing"" (reputation of the government minting it) and market share (number of places accepting it).

In my experience startups are just as willing to hire remote as any other business, with the possible exception of those who have no local talent at all.<p>> <i>Interface design can be done from anywhere on the globe. It's silly to restrict your hires only to locals or those desperate enough to relocate.</i><p>For the past 3 years, I've worked for possibly the most distributed startup in history.  At one point I think we were averaging something like 1.8 people per country, with the largest time zone gap being 8 hours between Sydney and Palo Alto.  I've telecommuted for several other jobs and a ton of contract work as well.<p>I know how to be effective remotely, and certainly running a startup this way gives you a hiring advantage, but it's not without significant downsides.  The idea that it's about hovering or butts-in-seats is a strawman to the extreme; that type of attitude is a sign of failing before you started anyway.<p>The reason to all be together is that the collaboration is better.  You will share ideas better, iterate faster, experience less friction in communication, and feed directly off the communal energy.

Bitcoin probably isn't going to become that, though, so I think it is less of a cause for concern.<p>3) Convertibility is a systemic problem because it's a confidence game. If the value of bitcoin is on a downward spiral rather than an upward spiral, then you would expect fewer buyers, and those buyers would pay less for declining assets. Paying less in turn sets the market value lower; it becomes cyclical.<p>And that's where (4) comes in. The reason ""when something goes wrong, it will die"" is a valid point is because of contagion and panic selling, and the reduction in the number of buyers in the market. It makes perfect sense to me, because it's the exact reverse analogue of why bitcoin has a built-in bootstrap advantage.<p>I'm getting the impression that people who like Bitcoins are the same kind of people who think gold has an intrinsic worth as a currency, rather than a commodity; in other words, they don't understand that the value of money is a product of supply and demand, no matter whether fiat or specie.

And if I was experiencing 37.5% annualized inflation (the opposite of 60% deflation), I don't think that would be particularly good either.<p>If you meant, by bringing up a central bank, to refer primarily to monetary systems based on a central bank, I don't believe that a government (a small subset of the population which is allowed to murder and kidnap and rob everyone else, and which is necessary for a central bank to exist) is a prerequisite for trade denominated in a common currency, so I'm not sure that the way our current monetary policy works is entirely relevant.  The Dallas fed wrote an interesting piece on changing policy to allow for negative nominal interest rates (<a href=""http://dallasfed.org/research/indepth/2003/id0304.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dallasfed.org/research/indepth/2003/id0304.pdf</a>), but I think we will have to settle for negative real interest rates for the near future.<p>Discounting the central bank bit, I'm first unsure that the bulk of business has to be financed through debt, and second unsure that a deflationary environment can continue to exist given a huge loss of productivity.  I would expect, if thousands upon thousands of businesses suddenly closed their doors to sit on cash, that the resulting shortage of necessary goods and services would put a quick end to the deflation.  This would be extremely painful and inefficient in the case of a large deflation, but any global currency of bounded quantity should eventually only deflate as rapidly as human productivity increases.",1307019648

4279350,comment,4276518,4278479,2,0,brudgers,,,"My comments have been motivated by the characterization of the inheritance tax as liable to leave the heirs as waifs. Sonnabend's heirs are middle aged adults, who like their mother were raised in wealth. There is nothing wrong with that, nor even with owning a $30,000,000 stuffed bald eagle (the prohibition on the sale of which I think is absurd).<p>However, the basis of my opinion regarding the inheritance tax in general is based on a simple political philosophy similar to that of Socrates - when one has enjoyed and benefited from the rule of law for a life time, the only ethical course is to accept those parts of the law which may be to one's detriment.<p>Sonnabend clearly benefited from the laws of the US for many decades - among those the ability to own private property, enforce contracts, and exchange goods for fungible currency. Indeed, it was US immigration policy which allowed her and her family to immigrate and transfer their wealth from Europe  on the eve of the Second World War.<p>The US tax code allows wealth to be transferred between generations in accordance with American values. The creation of a permanent aristocracy has not traditionally been consistent with those values. As for me, I shudder at the the thought of money constituting my most important legacy to those I love.",1343012355

4279344,comment,4279197,4279197,10,0,brc,,,"That's probably one of the best articles I've read on the real nature of 'alternative' energy in a while.<p>My rule of thumb is simple : if someone calls it 'Alternative Energy', it means it's an alternate to having a cheap, ready supply of energy.  Otherwise, it would just be called 'energy'.   Nobody calls Nuclear power alternate energy, even though it's radically different to anything else that came before it in terms of generating power.<p>The percentage of power generated from wind globally, currently, rounded to the nearest decimal place is zero.<p>Trillions of dollars have been spent on windfarms and solar panels around the world, and, as the article notes, it has made zero difference to the overall energy mix.   Yet it has affected national economies in real ways - the bankruptcies in Germany, Spain and elsewhere have real costs, as does taking the most basic economic input - energy - and making it more expensive for zero environmental gain at the global level.  Despite the countless examples of failures to point to, the boosters insist that it's the right course, when any  plain analysis shows the exact opposite.<p>There are plenty of people who hand-wave around the very real problems as outlined in the article, and say things like 'give it time, it will work out'.  But you have to be a starry-eyed believer who trusts in state-coerced solutions to gloss over the myriad of problems of trying to jump-start essentially niche technologies into mainstream adoption.<p>It takes real courage to rely on human ingenuity to solve problems and come up with solutions.  It's frightening to look at an issue and realise you have no answers at all.<p>But what's worse is to set off on a futile and damaging strategy just to be seen to be doing something, when that thing is ineffective at best, and damaging at worst due to the self-delusion inherent.  This holds at the personal, family, business, state, national and global level.",1343012266

I'm not suggesting they do the typical freemium model, which would be to offer users the option of paying to get rid of ads. Instead, I think they could try charging based on usage (kind of like heroku). They would have to keep the service free for the majority of users, but I think they could get by with charging super-power users; I.e. the ones who can't live without the service. I know many people that would fall into this category, and I'm sure they would be willing to pay $5/month if it meant keeping their facebook.",1343012092

4279319,comment,4277440,4279149,1,0,cschmidt,,,"My previous job morphed from being something quite interesting, to a company running a jobs website that sold education leads. Before I left, I ran the traffic to a website selling education leads.  It was many of the big online players. You should be aware that many of these schools had a pretty shady business model.  Their students would get student loans, fail to finish their degrees, and default on their loans.  That was Ok from the schools point of view, because for a year or two the schools were charging fairly high tuition rates. They were essentially programs for transferring money from the federal government (in the form of loans) to the schools. These are the so-called ""for profit"" schools. It is not their ""for profit""-ness that was the problem, if you will, but the way they treated their students.  The government is starting to really crack down on these abusive practices (bad for both students and the government). Many of the students were of a fairly low income background, who had never been to college. There are a number of news documentaries about this, under the ""for-profit"" label. It seemed from me, on the outside, that most of these students would have been better served taking classes for much less at a local community college.<p>I am only aware of SNHU in the sense that they were buying leads in the same space as the for-profit companies. You are right that technically they seem to be a traditional non-profit college, that has started an online program. However, that online program seems to be the tail wagging the dog in this case.....<p><a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2012/southern-new-hampshire-university"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2012/so...</a><p>I am not saying that they are bad - I certainly <i>don't know</i> that.  But before I signed up, I would spend a few evening Googling their specific reputation. I would worry that this school is simply trying to hide the same ""for profit"" motives in a non-profit cover. I know there are other players that are doing this exact thing, by taking over a small traditional school. In particular, find out what their graduation and retention rates are for their online students. What educational backgrounds do the students have? Is their program going to be of a quality that you'll be happy with?<p>There are a lot of very shady schools in this space. Make dead sure that you're not getting into something you'll regret. I guess, in short, <i>Caveat emptor</i>, there are lot of bad online degree programs.<p>Feel free to contact me directly (email in profile) if you have any other questions.",1343011668

If I recall average sale was in the ~2000-3000 range.  It's a pretty reasonable asking price without knowing anything about the domain.<p>As far as valuing, there is no way, scientific or otherwise to tell you value.  My favorite explanation from the sellers side is:<p>Value = Price * Probability of Sale<p>(Credit for that goes to Paul Shaw)<p>It so beautifully encapsulates many of nuances of domain names.  There is a unique supply and an infinite demand curve.  The probability of getting a sale as you go higher diminishes.  There is no 'one' answer to value, but it's completely dependent on the seller's risk appetite and expectations.<p>Finally, some practical advice.  There is nothing you can say, no tool you can use that a rational domain owner is going to accept and act on because you wrote it in your counter offer.  You have a max price, they have a minimum price, maybe you'll negotiate to a point where they overlap, maybe not.  I would counter offer (doesn't have to be your max price or you can play the ultimatum game) and see the response.  Repeat or accept.  For such a small number I wouldn't be countering more than once MAYBE twice.  I generally consider it a warning flag when the other party is negotiating over almost nothing.<p>Set your max budget and stick to it.  People are irrational towards the end of a deal.  Don't overspend and regret.  You've done the analysis beforehand, you know what it's worth to you.<p>Find other names and prepare a backup plan.  Don't tie yourself to one name.

Think of all the lethal scenarios that a gun can be used, replace with ""can of gasoline"" and see your straw man go up in flames.",1343008955

The thing is absolute freedom is a bit complicated especially given individual differences.

If you had fewer features, you'd still have 80% using a different 20%. Whose to say if you'd make more money or have happier users?",1343008910

The shape of a button and the act of depressing it are very important inputs. Our fingers are filled with a large number of sensors relative other parts of our bodies, and it's best that we use them.<p>Other instances where analog has been desired over digital:<p>* those brightness adjustment sliders in presentation rooms<p>* video game controllers<p>I'm sure there are more.",1343008908

Oxford University, and Cambridge too, is not a campus university, it is spread out all over Oxford. When you're stood somewhere near the centre of town (and the centre of Oxford isn't really that big) - which is where most tourists ask the question - chances are if they look around 40% of the buildings will be part of the university, and another 40% will be buildings owned by the university, or by a college, and rented out for profit.<p>40% is a random figure and probably an exaggeration, but here's a map of the centre of Oxford (i.e. Oxford without suburbs) showing university buildings and colleges in red: <a href=""http://www.planetware.com/i/map/ENG/oxford-map.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.planetware.com/i/map/ENG/oxford-map.jpg</a> (note also how the majority of green spaces are owned by colleges for sport, as well)<p>Edit: looking closer at that map I see some missing buildings that should be on there, and at least a couple that are smaller than they should be. But I don't know the whole university well enough so maybe there are also some shown too big, or some that shouldn't be on there at all.",1343008806

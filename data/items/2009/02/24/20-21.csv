493576,comment,493411,493552,0,0,old-gregg,,,"Well, for one, Russia never had a truly market economy that Putin (supposedly) destroyed, let alone a full-fledged democracy which roots Putin supposedly eliminated. That's the crucial moment that many Westerners simply aren't aware of or like to forget about.<p>I lived there in the 90s. Opening your own small business inevitably meant meeting with local gangs and paying them monthly. If that's the ""market economy"" Putin destroyed, then nobody is missing it for sure.<p>Pre-Putin Russia looked very much like a bandit state ruled by a few ""influential groups"" that Eltsin couldn't control. After USSR collapse, what Russia needed was a massive financial help from the West, similar to what Marshall plan offered Germany after WWII. Instead, they received vast numbers of western scam artists and mostly useless economic advice from IMF and very expensive loans (and the default which followed). That's why remarks like Michael Dell's will always make everybody there laugh and even anger.<p>For anyone who lived through those times, reading about ""Putin destroying democracy and market economy"" feels... strange, to say the least. Moreover, the article is filled with pointless exaggerations, like ""privatized all oil companies"". There are plenty of private energy companies there, just pick up Forbe's billionaire list: what do you think those Russian-looking last names represent?<p>Russia simply needs more time. Their political scene is interesting but not very practical: tons of small and disorganized democratic parties [always fighting each other], one big pro-government ""conservative"" one, plus always amusing and relatively numerous communists that are slowly dying off.",1235508885

But here's the dilemma I was pointing out (maybe not so clearly) in my previous comment: After your initial success, when your customers clearly want you to add widgets A, B and C but you want to work on innovative product Z instead, it takes a visionary and gutsy person to do that. I realize that there isn't always such a clear cut binary choice.<p>While it might not be an either-or proposition, many if not most entrepreneurs find their interests diverging from that of the business after initial success. If you're acquired, this is almost guaranteed.<p>37 signals, Facebook and Google all have one thing in common: the founders are still in control but it's hard to argue that Google still builds what Larry and Sergey want to build for themselves. At best, Google now builds what its employees want to make for themselves. I can assure you that day to day, Larry and Sergei's jobs look very different from their jobs in 1998.",1235506406

So I didn't count email, waste of time catch-up calls, cleaning my desk, clearing my desktop, etc. Then I clocked focusing on just one task that I termed long-term productive with no multitasking. If I had to take a call, I'd stop the clock.<p>I realized I didn't do all that much really productive stuff - lots of BS admin. So I set a goal of 30 minutes per day, and gradually expanded it to one hour, then eventually two hours. An amazing day I'd get six hours of LT productive work done. Like, it was a rare, epic event. By just getting two hours per day done, I was one of the most productive people I knew. (I also didn't let my admin totally melt down, but with a new focus that it's not really creating anything of value, I moved through it much faster and just got it done, instead of toiling in it to feel productive).<p>Most people are ""working"" a lot, but are not ""getting shit done"" at a very good pace.",1235505884

To get a useable prototype up to a level of completion where you can start to get user feedback doesn't take months, or even weeks if you're focused enough. The 77 hours works for the product, as my expectation aren't set as high compared to if he said ""...in 3 months"". It didn't take a lot of time or money, and he now has user feedback to shape the next iteration, or even decide the project isn't worth pursuing further.",1240011390
567815,comment,567314,567669,0,0,raganwald,,,"> The alternative is what... just not doing package versioning? That seems like a step backwards too.<p>Imagine that you have lexical scope for changes to global constants. Like Perl's local keyword or Lisp's let. So you can redefine Array and the new definition is only valid within the lexical scope of a block. Code that the block calls does NOT get the new definition, so your code can have one version of Array#sum, my code can have another, and we can freely call each other or call code that doesn't expect Array to have a #sum method.<p>Now thinking about that solution to the meta-programming collision problem, the solution to the gem version problem is also plain: gems can be scoped too, and if I use version 1 of a gem in a block and you use version 2 in a block, only the code within our blocks see the effects of the gems they include.<p>So yes, packages have versions, but the same mechanism that applies lexical scope to meta-programming mediates package version conflicts.",1240011277

If it happen to be that 99% of artists/muscicans/programmers etc can no longer find work in a post-copyright world, so be it.<p>I don't even believe that there is some sort of moral obligation to pay for copyrighted stuff anyway. Rather, I believe that the copyright system is an artifical insitution that modify the result of the free market. It distort incentive and direct resources to part of the economy where it wouldn't be in the first place.<p>The fact that the free market is starting to break into and killing all the players is simply reality intruding on people's illusions.<p>I am not here to suffer for a cause or anything but I want to survive so I can make a living on games, whether or not the market size has drastically shunk or expanded.<p>The thing that irate me the most is that game developers think that players have a moral obligation to support developers or not do something that percevied to hurt their revenues. We don't even have a moral standing to control what other people can do with their copies of the game. So we used words like ""stealing"" or ""piracy"" to justify oursleves as victicms of plunder when in reality, they're just copying stuff.<p>Yeah. Life is really harsh that way. Sometime we can only blame oursleves for being fools.<p>(on the other hand, 99% of all pirates are pussycats, losers, and cowards in term of their characters, but that's just another matter entirely)",1240010084

567786,comment,567483,567483,0,0,ieatpaste,,,"Personally, I have little trust in documentation. Not that it's useless, but that documentation rarely holds everything you need to know about the code. Usually, I'll take a high-to-low level approach, and use visualization programs/plugins which graph the class dependencies and overall structure. I'll take a look at the Jdoc/similar for class/function definitions, and then look at the run a debugger and look at the stack to see the flow of functions. This strategy works well for 99% of cases.<p>Though planning ahead is good, sometimes the extra, non-implemented features are dead weight until finished. I would recommend designing for expansion structure-wise, but working on just the immediate changes. This way it makes the code easier to read, and simpler (relatively speaking).<p>I'd like to know people's opinions for performance vs ease-of-readability/ease-of-extensibility. Personally, I find that when the code I've written is too complex, then the code probably isn't very good. In that case, I'll rewrite if the architecture is off, or just refactor to make it prettier/more extensible, even at the cost of a little performance.",1240009242

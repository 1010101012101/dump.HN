Renting and owning will always coexist.<p>Also, if streaming gets popular, then a million people will be doing it. So, instead of putting up a mp3 for download, now people will use some streaming service to stream it. What do the label companies get? They have the same piracy and control issue like before.",1207421624

If each only produces 100 watts, the cost of the inverter and utility hookup will make it untenable even if the panels are free.  (Inverter cost/watt goes down pretty fast with capacity and most of the hookup cost is independent of the capacity.)<p>There's also a huge psychological boost in being able to be energy neutral.",1207421566

He merely talked about what his internment was like, and he only made about five broadcasts.  Even so, I think he was incredibly naïve of him to do this, given that by 1940, the Germans hadn't simply crossed the line into uncivilized conduct, they had gleefully flown over it with flags raised and fireworks shooting.",1207421140

I would rank his to be the second biggest contribution to open source, just after linux.<p>I have been personally testament to the havoc that this disruptive piece of code has wreaked in the telecommunications business. I worked as an angel member in  my previous startup, where we built software used to handle the call dialling and management in call centres. Also known as a 'dailer',the software has a huge market in India as it is central to operating any call centre. Before we got in, the space was dominated by players like Avaya, who used to lug around with their huge expensive pieces of hardware (used to manage the real time routing and call logging). Asterisk changed all of it and made possible for small startups to enter the fray.<p>Proprietary and expenseive hardware solutions are now all but extinct in the small to medium call centre space and softwares driven by Asterisk rule the roost. Distributed systems running  on Astersisk are now slowly challenging the last bastion of expensive hardware telephony systems - the big call centre market.<p>Unlike the OS business, free and open source is  definitely set on winning this game - and it all began by one hacker wanting to test the limits of some lean, mean and pointer-ridden C code..",1207421064

All he said is that it'll revolutionize the music business, it has the full support of several record companies, they got half a million from vc's just for the idea, and apparently radiohead is tangentially involved.  I don't know if it's good or bad to have so many cooks in the kitchen before they've written a single line of code... but anyway, maybe it's something like fred's talking about.",1207420496

Electricity from solar thermal plants currently costs between US$0.13 per kilowatt hour (kWh) and US$0.17 per kWh, depending on the location of the plant and the amount of sunshine it receives. Conventional power plants generate electricity for between US$0.05 and US$0.15 per kilowatt hour (not including any carbon taxes or cap and trade related costs) but in most places it's below US$0.10 (wind power generally costs around US$0.08 per kWh).</i><p>I wonder how long it's going to take solar-thermal to gain traction.  The economics seem a lot better than just plain photo-voltaic solar that's been pushed for years.  And certain types of solar-thermal have an energy reservoir, so you can have peak load + base load capabilities, unlike wind power.",1207419592

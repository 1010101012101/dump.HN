I have not seen anything similar for feature phone developers.<p>2) Nokia's smartphones OSes do not have future within Nokia.

E.g.: SmarterPhone aquisition, Qt plans for feature phones, Meltemi, javascript based developement tools/environment for feature phones and most probably more I have not seen.<p>So basically it looks like Nokia will handle over to Microsoft factories, people who has experience with smartphones (hardware part only?), maybe some patents (actually Nokia and Microsoft already have deals in this area and most probably nothing will change here).

I see this as a blessing and a curse.<p>I think a little bit of impatience can help you achieve more than others who sit around waiting for things to happen/dawn upon them, but at the same time too much  can mean you miss out on the benefits of some things that take time to build. I think the balance between the two is very specific to the individual and unfortunately can only be found through experience and making your fair share of mistakes (and successes).<p>I generally feel ill anytime I see someone using a quote by someone famous to help define their life but this always brings a smile to my face when I think about it:<p>""If you don't know where you are going, any road will take you there.""",1326197326

The amount of the subsidy depends on the plan you choose, with higher-costing plans getting higher subsidies.<p>For example, a two-year, 50 EUR/month plan gets you a free iPhone 4S or the equivalent android phone, if I remember correctly.<p>Also, not a single phone, at any price range or contract status, is locked. Carriers don't care about locking the phones, you've got a contract with them and you're probably going to get a new phone at the end of it anyway.",1326196960

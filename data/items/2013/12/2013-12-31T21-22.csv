What if you were hit by a drunk driver on your way into work on Friday morning and end up in an extended hospital stay with multiple surgeries? The bill could rack up to several hundred thousand dollars. You get all of your medical bills and you think everything is just fine, your insurance will take care of it. Then, your insurance company sends you a letter that says you missed one of the dozens of questions during the course of filling out your policy and they cancel it on you. Now, you can either pay those bills (haha, unlikely), settle them (killing your credit), or declare bankruptcy (killing your credit). Now, you cannot finance shit. House, car, credit cards.

Your program had to execute in under a time limit (5 seconds, N=13), and I had come up with the best solution I could and was still at 7 seconds. It took me the rest of the month spending hours a day reading on speed optimizations in order to cut down every unnecessary instruction, and remove every intermediate variable. Eventually, the program executed in 4.9 seconds.<p>While quite interesting, the problem only took an afternoon to implement the algorithm. What differentiated my chops from my competitors was that I could improve my program beyond the first implementation.",1388527074

6993006,comment,6986797,6992711,2,0,skybrian,,,"Putting emotional reactions aside for a moment, I think the real point is that unbiased behavior is quite difficult to achieve and requires discipline. If you&#x27;re not doing anything systematic to root out bias and just relying on good intentions, it won&#x27;t be enough. Yes, having a variety of interviewers helps somewhat, but people can be biased in similar ways - it is possible for women to be unconsciously biased against other women, for example.<p>The solution isn&#x27;t bias in the other direction, but to look for ways to remove the bias. This is why in science we have things like double-blind studies, for example. In music, doing auditions behind a screen seems to have been effective.<p>Putting systematic measures in place against bias also tends to help with self-selection, since it assures applicants that they have a fair shot. I believe that&#x27;s what the original poster was asking for. I don&#x27;t know what the best solution is for something like Y Combinator, but it seems worth giving it some thought. Of course, it&#x27;s not going to be so easy as performing music behind a screen.<p>The percentages you cite show this is a problem in many industries. I doubt that 50% is achievable, but I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s helpful to either say &quot;these people are sexist&quot; or &quot;yeah, but everyone does it.&quot; Those are both examples of moralistic thinking.

As others have pointed out, this can be &quot;dangerous&quot; in the sense of flooding your console with crap (try typing [1..] in ghci; its&#x27; annoying, but not the end of the world either), but it&#x27;s also really convenient when that&#x27;s what you want.

He said that Google is pushing Chromebooks hard in 2014, and have been frustrated by stores not using the marketing displays they provide.

Then they cave when they realize this is a new market segment and a new product segment in the industry.  They are used to people coming to them to buy the old stuff.  Now they actually have to work, learn the new product, learn the new lingo and also identify customers who might be receptive to the message.<p>Then you have the guy who worked for a rather large company and is used to the fish jumping into the boat.  No fishing rod or fish finder required.  You don&#x27;t even have to know how to bait a hook.  These guys, amazingly enough, actually think they are selling.  When faced with a situation where the phone only rings if they make it ring they don&#x27;t do very well.<p>There&#x27;s the guy who faked it in a good market, got lucky and built a reputation on circumstance rather than skill.  When things change (i.e., the economy tanks) the reality of their capabilities comes to the surface.<p>Then there&#x27;s the inability to adjust to a change of audience.  You don&#x27;t sell to an engineer the same way you might sell to a manager or the president of a company.<p>One of the most frustrating things for me has always been the sales person who attempts to take credit for a sale that came in because I spent tens of thousands of dollars in marketing.  They think you are stupid.  Or at least they act that way.  Some of the most memorable moments in my experience have been after major trade-shows.  Imagine having a sales person come to you like he just climbed Everest to close a sale after you just spent over $100K to exhibit at a trade-show for a week.  You look further and you see the sale was due to a years-long relationship with the customer as well as a meeting at the trade-show where the sales guy didn&#x27;t even interface with the customer.  What did happen is that he got and printed the purchase order because he was in charge with monitoring sales@company.com.  In retrospect it is really funny and it also reveals interesting character flaws.<p>And, of course, there&#x27;s the mercenary sales person who will hand out discounts like they are candy in order to book sales and look like a genius to anyone except for the person who actually looks at the numbers.<p>There&#x27;s more, of course,<p>The advantage of the motivated newbie is that they can learn the product, the market and the approach.  It takes six months to a year of real work to get someone up to speed, but it can really pay off.  Most business owners I reached out for advice would roll their eyes when I asked for the secret to hiring good sales people.  Everyone had horror stories galore.<p>One of the toughest skills to learn for in-person sales is to know when to close your mouth and let the process happen.  When I started my business I would talk and talk and talk.  I probably lost more sales to that than any other blunder.  A year later, I&#x27;d show up to a call, &quot;read&quot; the room, meet some of the people I didn&#x27;t know, setup the demo and mostly let the customers sell themselves on the product.  Selling by saying less, not more, is a skill that takes time to develop.  Most really good sales people are very relaxed and confident during a sales call.<p>One of my friends put it like this:  It&#x27;s like the hotel business.  You can print beautiful brochures; exquisitely redecorate the rooms; have amazing food and all manner of services.  You can&#x27;t force people to take a vacation.",1388524438

This book will teach JavaScript programming to kids through building a Raspberry Pi powered remote controlled car (or or other vehicle).

Usually it&#x27;s just a case of buying the new laptop and logging them in. Last week I found a used Chromebox for my dad to replace his WinXP desktop. It went well, but I did get bitten. I didn&#x27;t know he even had a printer, and since you can&#x27;t plug a printer directly into ChromeOS, we had to buy a new, networked one (which does work amazingly well, btw). I also had to _write_ two Chrome Packaged Apps (fun learning experience, haha) to replace the WinXP camera import wizard he was using and his photo slideshow screensaver.<p>Despite all that, I&#x27;m still happy with the decision. It&#x27;s a super simple machine that&#x27;s fast as hell, updates without him even knowing, and is incredibly secure. And the dev APIs are getting reasonably complete pretty quickly, such that I was able to write a little app to import photos off a camera in just a couple days.",1388523802

6992833,comment,6991621,6992434,3,0,jarrett,,,"You said you were trying to offer a rebuttal. So I aim to show that the counterarguments presented do not rebut the author&#x27;s main point.<p>His main point is, roughly: 1) a variety of factors, including fear and antiselection, made for a broken health insurance market prior to the ACA, and 2) the ACA has substantially mitigated some of those problems.<p>> A quick example is the obvious contradiction in the following quotes from the blog:<p>The author is using the term in subtly different ways in different contexts. Not the best rhetoric, I admit. Yet, does his failure to define or consistently use the term &quot;free market&quot; undermine his thesis? I would venture not, but I&#x27;d be open to a counterargument. Otherwise this objection seems like just so much caviling.<p>> Later the post pulls out some talking points about Mitt Romney and some conservative think tanks, which are definitely relevant if you are trying to score political points instead of discussing healthcare policy.<p>The Heritage Foundation and Mitt Romney both played significant roles in the history of healthcare in the US. Historical background is often very useful in a policy essay. That appears to be the reason the author mentioned them. You&#x27;re free to disagree with the author&#x27;s characterization of their roles. But you didn&#x27;t.<p>> The closing section that glosses over the big problems with centralized planning systems (broken promises with no legal recourse, implementation issues caused by politics interfering with sound decision making) and finishes with enthusiastic exclamation points:<p>&quot;Broken promises with no legal recourse&quot; would be a pretty good characterization of pre-ACA health insurance, by the author&#x27;s account. Why would you expect the ACA to be any worse in this regard?<p>My experience has been that private companies very often fall victim to &quot;implementation issues caused by politics interfering with sound decision making.&quot; I&#x27;ve seen symptoms of that malady in every private health insurance company with which I&#x27;ve dealt. So, again, what evidence is there that this problem will be more acute under the ACA?<p>> It seems like political cheerleading to me, but maybe I&#x27;m missing something.<p>Yes, I believe you did. The article included much substantive information about the inner workings of health insurance companies and the economic forces that drive their behaviors. Indeed, there is much more of this sort of thing than there is political cheerleading, the latter being confined to the final section.<p>The presence of <i>some</i> political cheerleading does not indicate the <i>absence</i> of a valid argument. The fact that the author feels strongly about a certain political issue cannot be used to rebut his argument about that issue.<p>> To summarize this piece, it seems like this guy felt guilty for working at an insurance company, but now he feels better because the he politically supports the ACA, which he feels is going pretty well. Is there an apolitical thesis for this blog post that I&#x27;m missing? Why was it written if not to express a political position?<p>The author offers technical arguments concerning a matter of public policy. He then states a political opinion which follows logically from those technical arguments. There&#x27;s nothing invalid about this pattern of reasoning or argumentation.",1388523776

During the same year I did consulting gigs for Google here in Mexico also, which led to became the youngest ever Android SDK contractor in LATAM, at age 24.<p>This could sound great for you, but being totally honest, the main reason I dropped out was because I didn&#x27;t feel passionate about the stuff I was doing there.

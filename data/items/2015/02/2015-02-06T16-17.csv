I&#x27;m up for a new laptop in a year or so, and I&#x27;ll very much be seeing what Win10 will be doing. Only MS seems to have a vision of a all-in-one device.  Some of  the Yoga-style Win8 machines are interesting and tempting, but I still think they&#x27;re too thick and the price point isn&#x27;t terribly appealing.  To be fair, there are Yoga-style Dell inspirons at very cheap price points. My wife is interested in an 11&quot; or 12&quot; $349 one that folds back into a tablet form-factor with a touch-screen.  Performance wasn&#x27;t hot but I was pretty impressed that these kinds of things aren&#x27;t $899 anymore.<p>I also have no idea what is going on in the mobile space right now.  My N5 can barely handle Android 5 and the iPhones I&#x27;ve played with are not much better. My old ipad 3 can barely run iOS8 and Apple does not allow me to go back to 7.  The specs on these devices are at the point where they exceed computers running XP and Office not too long ago. There&#x27;s something very wrong with mobile today. The bloat is here to stay and Google and Apple just seem to be re-inventing PCs, but in the worst way imaginable - tacking on random crap every update and throwing more and more handware at the problem.<p>I&#x27;m more than willing to forgive a lot of the Win8 missteps if Win10 is good out of the gate. Especially if MS finally gets its security act together. I still dont understand why in this day and age my email or browser will deliver an unsigned exe to me, at least without explicitly allowing that. Or why my internet-facing apps aren&#x27;t strictly sandboxed. Or why there isn&#x27;t a built-in IPS system that can stop attacks as patches are pending.<p>>RMS&#x27;s stance on proprietary software.<p>I think its unfair to peg this as a FOSS vs proprietary battle, especially considering AOSP is open source. I think the chasing of the mighty mobile buck is sending these systems into the toilet. When your main motivator is pushing out viral apps to low information and low attention users, then the product will of course be sub-par.  MS has the incentive to produce a ecosystem that is more based on production than consumption and that&#x27;s why I think they&#x27;ll win in the end.  Consumption devices really won&#x27;t satifsy my use cases. Its a real shame Shuttleworth has moved towards the consumption model.",1423241923

I live in a peripheral area and I have been doing maintenance on Windows machines for quite a while to make some side money. Ideally, I&#x27;d like to not leave the area I live in to get a job. So, what if despite having a developer diploma, I extended my activity to include tech support and marketed myself as &quot;the all-around IT tech guy&quot; from said area? This place is quite touristic and I speak English so I&#x27;m confident I could achieve such a position.<p>But then I thought to myself: with the desktop declining and being replaced by smartphones or tablets, isn&#x27;t tech support becoming a dying skill? What can you tweak on an iPad? Besides setting up email accounts – which people won&#x27;t be doing while on vacation here. The younger generations are more tech-savvy, too; the two-click &quot;repairs&quot; I could do in 2004 are not going to make me look like a &quot;genius&quot; anymore.

I think the genesis of this expression was &quot;to set up <sthg>&quot; -> &quot;set up <sthg>&quot; -> &quot;setup_sthg&quot;. The &quot;to set <sthg> up&quot; form /is/ probably more correct in the prescriptivist sense, but my take is that this isn&#x27;t really a mistake, it&#x27;s intentional. &quot;setTestClassUp&quot; sucks because it spreads the logical units of the identifier all over the place.

I don&#x27;t like language arguments. While there&#x27;s always value in contrasting language features and keeping your horizons ever-expanding, nothing productive comes from them. All it does is foster an environment that promotes Impostor Syndrome and insecurity. As others have said, they believe the people who engage in these &quot;my language/framework is better than your language&quot; diatribes are acting on their own insecurity. If they are correct, it&#x27;s a vicious cycle that accomplishes nothing.<p>Better idea: Accept that no language is perfect, and if there isn&#x27;t a way to solve a specific problem (or the existing solution sucks), research and write a (better) solution. Even if it means sending patches to the PHP core (and having to deal with the toxic jerks on the mailing list). This is far more beneficial than arguing with people who don&#x27;t want to listen.<p>As PHP accelerates towards its version 7 release and cleans up a lot of the cruft from the 4.x and early 5.x days, a lot of the criticisms of PHP will cease to be applicable.<p>&quot;Those who can, do.

9009797,comment,9008845,9008845,0,0,kendallpark,,,"I guess I thought I put my two cents in as a smart but &quot;scatterbrained&quot; type of programmer. Prioritizing and focus has been my private war during my programming career. Here are some points I&#x27;d like to make.<p>1. Concrete, quantifiable goals. The first time I really ran into a wall with my issues prioritizing was during summer CS research after my sophomore year of college. I was given vague tasks that were basically &quot;make the program better.&quot; This doesn&#x27;t help someone that is prone to tangents. In the process of working on some part of the program I might discover a new thing that needed fixing, switch to working on that, and then down the crazy refactor rabbit hole.<p>2. Deadlines. Deadlines help a lot (as annoying as they are). I always did well in school because of deadlines. At my work we have a goal of completing X% of Q1&#x27;s weekly sprints on time. It&#x27;s a team goal, so if I don&#x27;t get my tasks finished for the week, the whole team doesn&#x27;t get clear the sprint for that week. I find the team aspect helpful. It also facilitates communication between team members. People that finish early often look at the sprint and check on members that aren&#x27;t done yet, offering assistance.<p>3. Boredom. Boredom is a real issue for me. I do better on harder tasks than easy ones because they&#x27;re interesting. This isn&#x27;t something I think a manager can solve because I think it&#x27;s on the programmer&#x27;s end to learn how to do work when it&#x27;s less-than-engaging. But you might find some of your scatterbrained programmers actually tackle hard problems better than easy ones. It really depends on the programmer.<p>4. Communication. I was pretty upfront with my manager about prioritization and focus issues. It&#x27;s something we discuss every time we have a one-on-one meeting. How things are going, what strategies I&#x27;m using, etc. He&#x27;s also great at pruning down my conceptions of tasks. I&#x27;ll read a task and think, &quot;Oh I need to get X, Y, and Z done&quot; and he&#x27;ll say, &quot;No, you just need X, the task doesn&#x27;t actually call for Y and Z.&quot;<p>5. The optimization struggle. This is probably the single largest contributing factor to my prioritization issues. I don&#x27;t like doing things a way, I like doing them The Best Way. A lot of time is spent figuring out which way is The Best Way. I might waste several hours working out a linear time solution to something I could easily write polynomially all the while n is small and it doesn&#x27;t really matter. Inelegant code bothers the hell out of me so I might start a small refactor which snowballs into a larger and larger refactor. This is something that your programmers will have to get a grip on--saying no to refactors in order to better focus on a task. But as a manager you can help by watching out for tangental refactors and putting a stop to them.",1423240808

9009724,comment,9008845,9009434,0,0,joesmo,,,"&quot;Excellent answer up until paragraph three. Nothing will drive your developers (good and bad) away quicker than an a &quot;quick morning standup&quot;, aka daily interrogation.&quot;<p>While it&#x27;s far from the worst thing to drive developers away, I do agree a standup/scrum meeting every day is stupid, counterproductive, and just plain useless.<p>For the managers, they should be able to look at your ticketing/project system and know instantly what everyone is working on. Keeping tickets up to date is part of the job and really, it&#x27;s not that hard.<p>For the programmers, they are now tasked with figuring out what to say in the standup and how to make sure that they are not perceived as not working when they really are. Programmers who need to know what other people are working on in the team can also look at the ticketing/project system and when they need more information (as in cases where their work depends on someone else), they will ask directly.<p>I&#x27;ve been to standup meetings in close to a dozen different companies, ranging from the smallest startup to some of the biggest tech companies and never have I ever seen a standup meeting end on time. NEVER. I don&#x27;t think it actually happens. What I have seen is the meeting go on for half an hour to an hour, boring everyone out of their minds. Sometimes this even involved multiple teams whose work barely intersected at all. The other team&#x27;s work status was a pure waste of time for anyone not on that team.<p>Yes, it is absolutely an interrogation. A daily standup shows that the manager doesn&#x27;t trust his employees. He doesn&#x27;t trust them to keep the ticketing/project system updated. He doesn&#x27;t trust them to do work without the threat of being shamed and/or seen as lazy if the work done doesn&#x27;t sound impressive in a standup. He doesn&#x27;t trust them to seek help on their own. Basically, a daily standup is the sign of an incompetent manager.<p>Scrum is for rugby.",1423240138

Adding new people to their social circle may just seem like something they don&#x27;t have time for right now, and if that is the case it isn&#x27;t a slight against you personally.<p>This is a critical point. My dear dead grandmother had a supremely wise rule of thumb: &quot;If people are being weird or cruel, it&#x27;s probably due to something that&#x27;s up with them, and not something you did.&quot; People are so wrapped up in their own problems. They can&#x27;t help it, none of us can, we&#x27;re trapped inside ourselves and our own perspective, everything we do and feel seems so important to us that we naturally assume it&#x27;s a primary cause for other people&#x27;s actions and reactions, too. Humans sometimes take this really, really far... They think that if they are bad, they&#x27;ll offend the god(s) and get struck by lightning. Nowadays many people mock belief like this---any notion that nature or the universe somehow care what you do---but even the staunchest atheist can still be caught assuming that everyone else&#x27;s bad moods, cruelty, indifference, and poor behavior are primarily due to STUFF THEY DID. This rule of thumb can seem depressing---nobody cares about me!---or you can view it as freeing, consoling, calming. Which is how my grandmother (and now I) mean it. Someone being cranky? Someone doesn&#x27;t want to hang out? Don&#x27;t jump to the conclusion it&#x27;s because you did something. Maybe they are just worried about bills. Maybe they just really have to poop.

You have to be a product manager (to get X done for some &quot;X&quot; that is larger than you can do yourself) and a people manager, and to manage up.<p>There&#x27;s no silver bullet, but I think you need to humanize yourself and the relationship.

Demixing and sampling. You send the mix as mp3 file, we run a complicated algorithm, and you get separated background and lead tracks as mp3 files. With those, you can do sampling or automatic karaoke.<p>?
Destructive Commons is a wonderful piece of signal processing technology which automatically unmixes an mp3 music file into its vocal and instrumental parts. You upload a mp3 file, you leave your email, and a few minutes later, you get a link for your separated tracks, which is up for a few hours.<p>Does it work?
Depends. Basically, the algorithm separates stuff that is repetitive from stuff that is not. Usually, you get vocals and instrumentals as separated tracks. You may end up with some guitar solo or such stuff. Indeed, those are not repetitive neither. Furthermore, separation is not perfect at all and you usually end up with sound artifacts. However, with sufficiently noisy covers or hardcore drums over them, that should be nice. Results depend of the original song, the weather and your cat.",1423238648

It need only be sufficiently descriptive of portions of workplace behaviour that designing incentives raises KPIs.

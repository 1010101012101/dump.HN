Thanks.",1241517219
593872,comment,593528,593776,0,0,duskwuff,,,"> What is a policy going to do?<p>The Mozilla Foundation controls addons.mozilla.org. If they decide an extension is against their policy, they can remove it from their repository - and, while this doesn't mean it's impossible to install, it makes it <i>MUCH</i> harder to find. For an extension that relies on a.m.o publicity as much as NoScript does, it'd be a death sentence.<p>> They tried this once with their icons and the name ""Firefox"". The result is that I don't actually know of anyone that uses ""Firefox"" anymore, they use ""Iceweasel"".<p>You must have strange friends.",1241517171

From the articles and the responses, it seems that it is only <i>his website</i> that blocks the CSS popups of Ghostely.<p>The plugin does not do any harm to ghostery. He just uses a CSS rule on his <i>website</i> to disable some of ghostery's functionality.",1241516427

I think the bigger question is with the premise of the site: why, exactly, would I want to ""debate"" Coke vs Pepsi, or Arsenal vs Manchester Utd?<p>Clearly, I'm not your target audience-- but the fact that most rivalries have less than 100 users seems to indicate that you're not hitting your target audience, whoever they might be, if they exist.",1241516180
593868,comment,593020,593757,0,0,wlievens,,,"Java communities typically favor portability (and easy deployment) over what you can gain in terms of speed. A lot of libraries/frameworks actually even advertise themselves as ""100% pure java"", whereas one might expect ""expensive bits optimized in C"" as attractive as well (but you rarely see it).",1241516102

593863,comment,593020,593020,0,0,wlievens,,,"He's absolutely right about pointer aliasing. I work on a DSP compiler for architectures strongly geared towards instruction-level parallelism, and when the compiler occurs pointers that may alias (but probably won't, but we can't tell because of the language's liberal use of pointers), many optimizations have to be a lot more conservative.",1241515943

593860,comment,593729,593729,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"My 2 cents: The eye's perception of color ""white"" is _very_ dependent to context. That's why whatever change this does to the monitor at first, it will not be visible in a few minutes. Also why I check the ""slow transition"" checkbox. The least you notice about it the more useful it is. Or so I'm guessing.",1241515599

Only 30 minutes later I was barely noticing it anymore. And on second day, after an allnighter, I realized that it really does reduce my eyestrain significantly.<p>That said, the tool itself is not without flaws, at least not the linux version.<p>I'd much prefer if I could just manually set the color temp without their latitude magic which is always off by an hour or two in my area. Also I'd want it to fade gradually instead of switching over in one fellow swoop.<p>Maybe a fellow hacker can point me to a command line util that lets me manually set the color temperature in X11?",1241515592

593847,comment,593020,593838,0,0,AlisdairO,,,"gcc certainly does (use -std=c99).  If you don't want to use C99, use __restrict__ to use it as a gcc extension.  This is C-specific - I don't believe a similar standard has worked its way into C++ yet, although compilers may have extensions that support it.

Even if the language itself is safe, there's usually a FFI.<p>""I believe it is the case that there are libraries that are acceptable for use with more java, but their use will be discouraged if Clojure is thrown into the mix.""<p>Why do you believe this is the case?

This point is clearly fundamental but one easily missed by hackers living inside their products.<p>I've intentionally put zero marketing and promotion into my startup as I'm completing a full-time undergraduate degree and can't provide high quality customer service to a large customer base. The product is great in so far as those that use it (about a dozen) love it. But since no-one knows of it, the customer base barely stays in double figures.<p>The end result is interesting and the process is worth noting. The tactics used to generate the buzz may be questionable in places. Change the implementation as per any ethical concerns and you have an interesting buzz-generating framework starting point.",1241514110

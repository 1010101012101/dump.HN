In fact, I spent a lot of time arguing for us to switch from a per-request pricing model to a per-host model. Reasons we did it:<p>1) Per-request is unpredictable. Paying 2x because you got a traffic spike and had to auto-scale sucks. Paying 10x because you got a traffic spike and handled it without autoscaling sucks more. Getting capped at day 20 in the month because we didn&#x27;t want variable pricing sucks the most.<p>2) Estimating cost is nigh-on impossible. If we charge per metric, quick, what will it cost per month?<p>3) The price we picked per host is, to some extent, based on the amount of data we collect and store. We store every traced request for 90 days, and do analysis on all of that as it comes it. The AWS bill to pay for all that analysis and storage isn&#x27;t trivial.<p>The dinosaurs of the early 2000s got around this by saying &quot;just pay for the license, and store it yourself!&quot; And you ended up with customers that had 2 hours of data retention, because storing it all was expensive.<p>I guess the point I&#x27;m trying to make is, we&#x27;re in a different league of data collection than something like Pingdom. There are serious costs associated with all that -- we&#x27;re not colluding to screw you, we promise :)<p>Edit: Check out Twitter Zipkin and Etsy CrossStitch if you want open-source. The basic collection tech exists, but it&#x27;s a pain to run yourself. At least, that&#x27;s what we hear from customers.",1412866459

Monopolies tend to provide poorer service and are more conservative because there is reduced incentive or pressure to change.<p>Police are a perfect example of this; democracy is a weak lever.<p>Edit: This is not inherently an argument against the provision of the police as a public good. It could be accomplished within democracy by stronger localization and flexibility in choice of provision (e.g. allowing neighborhoods to opt out / choose their own solution).",1412866160

Do you disagree that BI will increase consumption?<p>The point of BI is to redistribute consumption to the lower end of the economic distribution, at the expense of the higher end, not to increase overall consumption, though that might happen as a side effect.<p>The net increase in consumption minus the net productivity gains will be the cost of BI, paid to increase economic equality. However, I have seen quite a few (in fact I would say most) proponents of BI argue that the &quot;cost&quot; will be negative, that the productivity gains will, overall, exceed the increase in consumption.<p>A basis for this claim is that the marginal return on consumption for poorer people is higher than for richer people, and so they can more efficiently use the redistributed consumption, leading to higher overall productivity. The issue of consumption is, therefore, only half of the argument, and must always be considered in tandem with productivity.<p>The answer to your final question in this context is that we should favour BI because it is intended to increase net productivity at the same time as increasing consumption on the low end: we will have our cake and eat it.",1412865686

When mortgage interest rates fluctuate between 6-10% say, a person doesn&#x27;t get terribly underwater that fast.  But when they fluctuate between 3% and 7% a person can go from equity->underwater in a hurry, because the price fluctuations are so much larger.<p>It&#x27;s basically a y=1/x kind of problem and the closer you get to x=0 the closer you get to y=infinity in a very nonlinear way.

If you had a BSD machine on the same network as a Linux or SunOS machine, they can communicate using standard protocols. Further, the applications themselves were portable between POSIX implementations.<p>The Unix Way is to have small programs that do one thing extremely well; when an application (with the exception of emacs) starts emulating Zawinski&#x27;s Law, they&#x27;re usually broken up into smaller pieces. I do not want one app that handles cd, ls, pwd, rm, mv, etc. I suspect that if Poettering/Sievers released an app (let&#x27;s call it &quot;fileD&quot;) that did exactly that, the Unix community would gather the torches and pitchforks to go put an end to the nonsense.<p>Kinda like they&#x27;re doing right now with systemd.<p>A Unix that does not implement or respect POSIX is not Unix. And if the major GNU/Linux developers wanted to try a different direction, they can. But they don&#x27;t.

However police-types seem to be very conservative by nature which can lead to a very technophobic workforce.<p>It is pretty surprising how slowly police are changing with the times. You&#x27;d expect every major police force to have a &quot;computer crimes&quot; division, but they don&#x27;t. Only really the MET (London&#x27;s police force) has a decent computer crimes division.<p>You often read about digital crimes (e.g. harassment, theft, fraud, etc) going completely uninvestigated because of how few &quot;digital police&quot; they have (e.g. 1/1000th the size of the officers investigating physical crimes).<p>As a specific example, for almost a year when you Googled &quot;UK passport renew&quot; the first Google adword result was an obviously fraudulent one, yet nothing was done even though they had to have known about it.<p>PS - I bet you could use Tasker (or a similar app) to wipe your phone if it didn&#x27;t regain data access for a long period of time (e.g. 6-12 hours). So if they took your phone and shoved it into a bag, the phone still auto-wipes if they fail to turn it off.<p>PPS - Although realistically you&#x27;re best not storing the data on your phone at all.

A 10 hour transfer time smells of magnetic platters.<p>The reason HDD vs SSD would impact prediction is that the throughput of an HDD is impacted more severely by a greater number of variables when transferring at the filesystem level than a SSD.

The key differences are:<p>* Transparency.<p>* The ability to fix it yourself.<p>Also consider this: No one submits patches to fix vulnerabilities in closed source software because that&#x27;s not possible without the source.  This results in all sorts of problems that just don&#x27;t exist when the code is available:<p>* After reporting a vulnerability you now have to wait for the vendor to fix it.  If the vulnerability isn&#x27;t out in the open (yet) they might take their sweet time while you nervously twiddle your thumbs.<p>* If the vendor doesn&#x27;t support the product anymore (or the vendor doesn&#x27;t exist anymore) then there&#x27;s really no options at all.  You have to live with the vulnerability or get a new product.<p>* When the vendor releases a fix how do you know if they fixed the core vulnerability or just the edge case that was given to them?  All too often vendors apply hacks to detect specific edge cases instead of fixing underlying problems.  This is why attackers are able to take advantage of <i>old</i> vulnerabilities by means of simple fuzzing (or just being clever).<p>For example, I reported a horrific information disclosure vulnerability (SSNs in the clear) once and their &#x27;fix&#x27; was to base64-encode the data.  If I didn&#x27;t keep track and follow up with them (took them four months to release that &#x27;fix&#x27;) it is likely that vulnerability would still be present.<p>There&#x27;s actually a lot of other problems related to closed source vulnerabilities and fixes but I&#x27;m out of time...",1412864218

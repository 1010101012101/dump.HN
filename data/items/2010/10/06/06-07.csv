Every programmer is required to learn the rules of the mechanism in order to understand others' code. Furthermore, it needlessly increases the amount of possible programming styles, which, in my opinion, is a bad thing.<p>C programmers have always used semicolons and never wasted a second thinking whether they should.",1286348399

I don't have a definitive answer but we can make some semi-educated guesses by googling about.<p>I think the failure mode designers worried about was not the parachute just up and ripping off - the forces involved and component strengths and safeties required could be computed. They were concerned about parachutes failing to deploy at all or failing to deploy effectively, which is harder to model and predict.<p>Both Soviet and early US landing capsules (Mercury, Gemini) had single parachute systems. The Soviet safety design choice from the beginning was a fully redundant main parachute system. I don't know what the setup was for Mercury, Gemini capsules had ejection seats in case the main parachute failed.<p>Apollo Command Modules, designed to go to the Moon, were both heavier than the other capsules of the time and had stricter weight constraints. It seems like NASA determined two parachutes failing was extremely unlikely. So three parachutes, one of which can fail seems like the right choice given the constraints of weight and safety.<p>The actual recorded failures appear to confirm the difficulties were about deployment, more than anything else.<p>In 1967, Soyuz 1's main parachute failed to deploy, the backup parachute deployed but got tangled in the drogue and was ineffective. Cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov was killed on impact.<p>In 1971, Apollo 15 splashed down safely with two functional and one failed main parachute.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_1</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_15"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_15</a><p><a href=""http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19730062665_1973062665.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/1973006...</a>\n<a href=""http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660020968_1966020968.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/1966002...</a>",1286347916

I would claim that at some later point, after more courses, labwork and discussions on the subject, I did understand certain parts of it. Much of the additional knowledge and principles I learned are already implied in decent basic texts on the subject, but I simply wasn't in any position to 'expand' those implications.<p><pre><code>  There's tons of stuff you can do with this foundation,\n  including writing DSLs.\n</code></pre>\nHowever, writing your first DSL on that foundation requires you to reinvent many wheels, some of which you will reinvent in a square way that first time. Knowing how to write a programming language in Lisp doesn't tell you how to write DSL's, like having a Ph.D. in English means you know how to write a novel, without you actually being capable of writing an <i>good</i> novel. They would still benefit from reading books on 'writing novels' by people that have practical knowledge in writing actually good novels, even if those books were written by authors whose genre they dislike and the style of whom's examples they dislike.<p><pre><code>  the distinction between internal and external DSLs?\n  Completely unnecessary.\n</code></pre>\nIf everyone would program in Lisp: yes. However, people write DSL's in different languages, for all kinds of reasons you may or may not agree with. That means books on writing a DSL in other languages than Lisp simply have their place. And may also be valuable for those writing DSL's in Lisp, for the reasons mentioned above.",1286347460

However from personal experience I usually discover a core problem that was causing these symptoms.  Resolving that problem takes care of the lack of motivation and focus.<p>Perhaps the specific work environment isn't for you.  One job I worked directly out of university crushed my soul as a developer.  As an intern I had vast responsibility and did a lot of interesting projects.  Once I joined on fulltime, they were going through a restructuring period and I ended up doing trivial work putting out fires.  Luckily they downsized a third of the company a  few months later and I was fired - a blessing in disguise there.  A week later I was running a small team doing innovative new projects at a large corp.<p>Often it can be outside factors in life that strangle your productivity.  When my father was very sick and hospitalized, my work drastically suffered.  I'd like to consider myself a strong individual whose outlook on life would allow me to deal with such events with ease.  However, in the situation without knowing it at the time it was impacting my life.  Instead of taking a few weeks off and dealing with the issues at hand, I threw myself into my work while my progress continued slowing exponentially.  Eventually I was working 16 hours a day and writing 0 lines of code.  I ended up quitting that job, and taking time to deal with my life.<p>Anyways, the moral of the story was stepping back and discovering the root cause of these symptoms can be very beneficial.

I've only really gotten into heavy testing in the last year or two, but having tests also improves confidence that your changes are not bringing down the entire system.<p>Finally, what I would say is you need to get into a habit of mentally stimulating yourself after work.  I found that when I was in a rut, I thought that I was burnt out and needed to ""veg out"" more, but I later felt that vegging out only bred more laziness and more procrastination.

The rails 3 project is like some 2500 files and I dunno how many lines of code. There's great benefits in using a framework, most of which is consistency and no need to write the boilerplate functions. Here's a few things to think of:<p>1. When using a framework you can treat it like a black box, you don't actually need to know how it works, but you need to have a good enough <i>idea</i> of how it could work - that's why so many people roll their own framework in the beginning of their career - it's very useful to have done that.<p>2. Do you know Object-Orientation works? Can you program object oriented code? I did a lot of programming before I knew OO and could <i>just not understand a single line</i> of object oriented code (that I sometimes had to write in perl using the godawful OO syntax at that time). I just poked at that code until it worked, but I had no way of understanding the code. Took a class in OO programming at the university and it was dead easy after that. I suspect that it would be VERY HARD to grok rails without being able to code object oriented code.<p>3. Perseverance - for me learning new programming languages and environments always includes making the code work first and then understand. Programming is a practical thing, it either works or not works and the theoretical understanding is just a tool that's more or less useful. You'll just have to keep on working on it until it runs and then try to understand what you have done, you might not even have to understand how rails works, you just have to know enough where to put stuff and have enough experience to know what to do.",1286345151

I find <i>good</i> programming roles to be highly enjoyable, challenging, and rewarding jobs. Sounds like you might need a change - shake things up a bit, re-examine assumptions and that sort of thing. It's very bad in the long run to hate your job.",1307545194
2633351,comment,2631964,2632259,9,0,rayiner,,,"Except that code isn't really that far from what you might type. I've spent a lot of time working with code that uses templates heavily (including ""well designed"" libraries like Boost) and it's just a god-awful mess. Make an error in instantiating a template class and you get an error message that refers to code deep in an STL header. Want to make your container class iterable? Get read to write dozens of lines of inscrutable boiler-plate code. Even something simple as iterating over a container is braindamaged. Before the auto keyword you had:<p><pre><code>    for(vector<some_really_complex_type>::iterator itr = something.begin(); itr != something.end(); ++itr)\n</code></pre>\nThen you need to use ""itr."" It's a pointer-like thing that isn't quite a pointer, and when you hold pointers in your container, which you often (usually) want to do you have to deal with a pointer-to-a-pointer which is almost never pleasant. And when you deal with keyed containers you have to remember the iterator actually points to a pair so you have to do .first and .second (why not .key and .value?)<p>Braindamage doesn't even begin to describe it.",1307545178

Fancy features (e.g. statistics, user behaviour, ...) are not required.\nFor the more serious surveys/elections, reliability is a key requirement.<p>There are a large variety of survey tools online available, which I would categorize like this:<p>1. Professional: They offer a range of plans (usually a basic plan/trial is free) and are rich in features; they typically work well.\nPROBLEM: Usually expensive; their low-end (free/cheap) plans are often limited in users (e.g. free for <30 participants).<p>2. Hobby: These are limited in features but free; they don't always work well.\nPROBLEM: Unreliable. It's hard to get people to vote as it is. People receiving multiple invitations to vote is problematic. People receiving no invitation to vote is unacceptable in some cases (e.g. elections).<p>I'm a firm enemy of NIH, so it would be preferable if some alternative could be found.",1307545038

You wont find a lot of doctors or lawyers bragging about how low their rates are because price is a perceived indicator of quality. That being said, a convention began a long time ago that a fair price to pay to a top notch bank is 7% and everyone has stuck to it. If you were a client and were quoted 8%, you would demand to know what makes you different than the hundreds of other (perhaps weaker) companies that got a better deal. If you were quoted 5%, unless the circumstances were extraordinary, the dozens of companies in the pipeline are going to expect the same treatment. So the question to the investment bank comes back to this: why rattle a system that works and is accepted as is?<p>To be frank, price competition exists in banking but most companies dont care about it.

From the Wikipedia page (take it for what it is):<p>On 14 February 2003, Dolly was euthanised because she had a progressive lung disease and severe arthritis. A Finn Dorset such as Dolly has a life expectancy of around 11 to 12 years, but Dolly lived to be only six years of age. A post-mortem examination showed she had a form of lung cancer called Jaagsiekte, which is a fairly common disease of sheep and is caused by the retrovirus JSRV. Roslin scientists stated that they did not think there was a connection with Dolly being a clone, and that other sheep in the same flock had died of the same disease. Such lung diseases are a particular danger for sheep kept indoors, and Dolly had to sleep inside for security reasons.<p>Some have speculated that a contributing factor to Dolly's death was that she could have been born with a genetic age of six years, the same age as the sheep from which she was cloned. One basis for this idea was the finding that Dolly's telomeres were short, which typically is a result of the ageing process. The Roslin Institute have stated that intensive health screening did not reveal any abnormalities in Dolly that could have come from advanced ageing.",1307543296

According to \nGoogle data released on May 2011, 25% of active Android handsets run on platform \nversions more than 18 months out of date. Meanwhile, according to app analytics firm \nLocalytics, only 20% of existing Apple 3GS devices had not yet been upgraded, just two \nmonths after the introduction of iOS4.

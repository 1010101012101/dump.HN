While many firms have relationships with defence contractors, the local military and intelligence agencies, we're not all writing undetectable rootkits and exploit code for commercial gain. I would say the actions disclosed in the very well written article (in a series of very well written articles) highlight one of a subset of security firms. I'm loathe to use the enron-esque bad apples description, because the truth is I just don't know but I suspect that such actions are limited to a minority of firms.",1298113049

2238847,comment,2237874,2237874,0,0,espeed,,,"Watch Malcolm Gladwell's interview with Fareed Zakaria for his book ""Outliers"" (part 1: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCt1Wc8Kx4U"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCt1Wc8Kx4U</a>, part 2: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf3NalDYIT8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf3NalDYIT8</a>).<p>In ""Outliers"" Malcolm explores what makes a person successful and asks the question, ""Why do some talented people flame out early while others go on to brilliant careers?""<p>Malcolm's main premise is, ""Success doesn't have much to do with talent. It's almost always a product of hard work and the culture of which we live our lives.""<p>But I think Malcolm is really describing the development of genius and how the environment/culture either encourages or discourages people from focusing on a certain areas or ideas. Go the wrong way and you miss developing into your true potential.<p>From my perspective, genius is not so much measured by IQ, although a high IQ helps, but genius can be measured by how rare and valuable your perspective is and how effectively you see patterns in- and make associations or connections among disparate ideas. Paul Cooijmans has a similar perspective (<a href=""http://www.paulcooijmans.com/genius/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulcooijmans.com/genius/</a>).<p>Developing these rare or unique perspectives usually takes deliberate and devoted focus on something (like when Malcolm talks about the 10,000-hour rule).<p>Einstein wasn't a genius because he was most skilled in math -- he wasn't -- Einstein became a genius because he relentlessly explored a problem, following it our farther than anyone had taken it before. This allowed him to see connections that no one had seen before, and these connections/discoveries were valuable to humanity.<p>So yes, praise kids for their effort -- it's one of the requisite components of genius.",1298112197

Not by people who work for companies hiring, not by jobs applicants. What value do they add, other than going through a big pile of CVs/resumes and turning it into a smaller pile of CVs/resumes (and, by the sounds of things, likely tossing out a whole load of excellent candidates in many cases)?",1298111852

2238840,comment,2238408,2238408,0,0,iuguy,,,"If you're ever planning on sending your CV to a recruiter, don't use LaTeX. Recruiters (reputation for being upgraded estate agents and scum of the earth aside) will want to remove any contact details from your CV to ensure that their client doesn't attempt to contact you except through them. This is why they'll push for word document versions.<p>You might think, ""Oh, well I'll just find a recruiter that won't do this"" but depending on your chosen profession this may be harder than you think.<p>You might think, ""Ok, well I'll just create a PDF version without contact details on it"" but that's not enough, because some recruiters actually don't put people forward because they sent PDFs, while telling them that they're putting them forward - the reason being that you're at the back of the queue not because of ability but because you're 'difficult' or they're not able to stick the recruiters logo on or easily paste into their template.<p>Now if none of this is an issue for you, feel free to go ahead and submit a latex generated pdf. Sadly, Word is the lingua franca of recruitment. I've had two guys interview with me independently of a recruiter for positions after said recruiter told them they'd put them forward when they didn't - in both cases the used a Latex CV.<p>Finally, formatting is relevant only to a point - if you've got experience in your field then that trumps any formatting. I've hired guys who use comic sans in their CV because they were bloody brilliant, not because they were funny.",1298111464

2238823,comment,2229708,2235787,0,0,iuguy,,,"I'm from the UK, and have worked for American companies before. My experience with working for American tech firms (and I'm not saying that they were like this because they were American, my sample is way too small to draw any conclusions) is that compared to the UK they tend to overwork people, focus heavily on building a culture with an overly (for UK culture at least) gung ho spirit a la 'yeah, go team foo!' - which in my experience (and again, not saying this is all American firms, just the ones I've worked for) means people working crazy unpaid hours, pressure to go out after work (if you're not out drinking after work you're not part of the team - I've seen two ex-colleagues' marriages break up because of this) and a corporate kick-off culture that seems to be more about a Ballmer-esque 'Ric Flair impressions contest'[1] than achieving real results. For me personally, this doesn't line up with my culture and as such feels forced rather than based on genuine bonds - hence the hollow sensation you've quoted.<p>By contrast, British companies tend to focus more on getting the job done, going home and spending time with the family. Sometimes you pull late ones, but you're not expected to be in the office at 9am the next day. In some places there's beer after work, but you're not expected to go (at the risk of being denounced as a 'non-team player').<p>To provide a comparison, working in France is completely different. In France the work-life balance is shifted further towards the life end, in the Middle East (if you're a local) even more so.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvsboPUjrGc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvsboPUjrGc</a> - ok, that's an extreme example, but tone it down about 97%, crank the alcohol levels up by 40% and you're roughly where ISS was in 2001.",1298110472

Currently, you get no benefits if your disabled for 5 months and a significant check if it's 6 months.  With BI, you get the same money either way, and while it's probably less than the 6 month benefit the risk reduction is worth a lot.<p>Better yet, get laid off and want to try making iOS apps?  Just do it, your benefits are unaffected if you want to start a company.<p>Now, the downside is currently upper middle class people get higher disability benefits/social security payments.  With BI that goes away, society does not care how old you are or what you made you get the same basic income as everyone else.  So you better have savings if you want keep living in a high cost of living area.",1367715458

5656976,comment,5656249,5656882,23,0,michaelochurch,,,"With BI, there are going to be some people who use it as an excuse to slack off. They're not ambitious or energetic and, relieved of the need to make something of their lives, they probably won't do much. That's true.<p>Here's a question: how much are they doing right now? My guess: not much. Given the high rate of unemployment that exists already, it seems like society's value for unskilled work is pretty low already. So I don't think the bulk loss to society in having the least ambitious ~10-20% slack off is that bad, especially if a large number of people are <i>more</i> engaged in their work.<p>Parasites at the bottom of society are pretty harmless. Parasites at the <i>top</i>, on the other hand, are extremely damaging. We have a lot of the second kind. Because people have to work and most need a steady income that just barely meets expenses, that pretty much means they end up in a subordinate role, there's a class of useless people called ""executives"" who have total control over the economy (and mediocritize it, because it's best for their positional stability to do so) because people are terrified of losing the jobs and incomes.<p>If there's a trade-off between having more parasites at the bottom of society who don't work vs. having more parasites at the top who ruin others' work, I'd take the former, hands down.",1367715209

I'm pushing 40 (will be 40 in July) and I haven't seen any evidence of age discrimination yet.  I did get laid off from a programming job about 2 years ago, but, to be quite honest, I had mentally ""checked out"" a good year or so before along with about half of the other stuff, most of whom left voluntarily or also got laid off.  It was a shit job with shit management, and we all groused about it and start making it clear to management that we felt that way, so no big surprise there.  OTOH, I had a new job lined up within < 8 hours of the layoff announcement.  That goes mostly to the fact that I network a lot and knew exactly who to call,  but still...<p>Now, working in a slightly different role as a traveling consultant type, as opposed to a ""sit in the same office day after day after day working on the same product"" I find that my age sometimes actually helps.  I've been sent to help some of the younger consultants because, as my boss put it, the customer ""wants to see somebody with some grey in their beard"".  And, unfortunately, a little bit of grey <i>is</i> starting to show in my beard.  :-(<p>Anyway, it's just one bit of anecdotal evidence, and I don't mean to claim that age discrimination doesn't happen.

However only very few economists, such as Milton Friedman, have advocated it as a practical policy.<p>On the one hand, guaranteed income is much more resistant corruption, since the distribution of money follows a simple rule where there is no discretion on the part of officials, and is similarly resistant to other kinds of rent seeking.<p>On the other hand, through traditional welfare systems, governments may be able to determine who is really in need, and thus save money on giving out welfare to people who could be earning more if they had to.  Governments can also give out welfare in kind rather than cash, helping people to make better choices, or make welfare conditional on getting education or training.<p>I very much doubt that a negative income tax could improve over the best administered welfare systems such as Australia's.  What is interesting is whether countries with much less ability to administer public services, would be better off with a guaranteed income.",1367714170

Firstly, the complexity for the arithmetic operations you listed mostly only matters if you are working with big numbers (something that is not very common to be a bottleneck). Factorization doesn't have a polynomial algorithm so I don't see why the complexity matters anyway (its still going to take longer than your lifetime with hard inputs anyway). As for linear systems, it depends a lot on your input and the problem you want to solve. If we talk about the Simplex algorithm that most people use, empirically it takes around cubic time but its still an open problem to find a base-choide heuristic that does not have pathological exponential worst case performance. In addition to that, many important problems are modeled as linear programs but will have extra special structure that let them be solved with more efficient algorithms.<p>Finally, you got me when it comes to the numerical stuff (eigenvectors and matrix inversion).

Specifically, in people with naturally low dopamine responsivity[1][2], it's almost non-existent. Within this group, you don't tend to see anyone who enjoys casinos and/or casual-social-mobile games, for example; they experience no dopamine hit from one session, so they aren't drawn to replay.<p>There's a categorization system of psychological reward profiles, originally derived from MMO play-styles, called the Bartle test (<a href=""http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm</a>). Of the four Bartle types, people with low dopamine responsivity are almost never ""Achievers""--instead tending to focus on the other three. Here's the description of the category:<p>> Achievers regard points-gathering and rising in levels as their main goal, and all is ultimately subserviant to this. Exploration is necessary only to find new sources of treasure, or improved ways of wringing points from it. Socialising is a relaxing method of discovering what other players know about the business of accumulating points, that their knowledge can be applied to the task of gaining riches. Killing is only necessary to eliminate rivals or people who get in the way, or to gain vast amounts of points (if points are awarded for killing other players).<p>In a business context, people who aren't Achievers are almost[3] inherently MacLeod ""Losers.""<p>---<p>[1] Low dopamine responsivity is diagnosed around 7% of the time as ADD/ADHD. It is so widely prevalent in modern populations, though, that many doctors refuse to recognize, diagnose, or treat for that condition, dismissing it as ""a healthy psychological state which just doesn't mesh very well with the expectations of the labor market."" However, you will frequently find that someone treated for ADD/ADHD, whether or not it is a real condition, will <i>become</i> a Bartle ""Achiever"" where they previously were not.<p>[2] People who have had chronically-low dopamine responsivity their whole lives also tend, more than the median member of the population, to self-identify as either ""nerds"" or ""creatives"" (or both.) When you don't derive any internal ""rush"" from competing with others (whether ""doing the sports"" or ""going into finance"" or ""making the sale""), you tend to need to ""make your own fun""--which leads to such pursuits as programming, science-fiction, and Minecraft; or to painting, writing, composing, et al. There is a reason, besides their market value, that an MBA in a down market will ""hustle"", while an Illustration-major will work as a barrista.<p>[3] The ""Explorer"" play-style/reward-profile gives them the ability to also be ""Technocrats"" (in your terminology), though.",1367714083

I was with you until this point:<p><i>They accept your money today on the tacit belief that you have provided enough value to someone else, somewhere else that it will even out in the end when it is their turn to consume.</i><p>Most merchants will not care whether you earned you money by doing one thing or another, found it in the street, got it from a rich uncle or the government. What they want to know is whether they will be able to exchange it for things they (and their business) need. If printing 1% more money results in a 1% increase in GDP, for instance, then there will be no inflation (simplification but mostly true) and everyone accepting the money an keep getting goods at the same prices.<p>A lot of times money is created for being invested, eg banks giving loans to finance ventures. This money has to be backed by some demand for the money - usually that is tied to the credit of the issuer. The credit of a government is backed by the tax income from those doing business in its jurisdiction. As long as that place attracts business, it will have tax revenue and therefore its money will cotinue to be valued. If it attracts 2% MORE business with 1% more money that's benefitting its economy.<p>As for your idea of fairness, getting something for nothing ... well that's why humans have societies and civilizations in the first place. Just by virtue of being human, you get all this nice stuff you wouldnt get in the jungle. We set up these systems to get something just for being human. And if we are to get anything, it is a safety net for all to prevent them from DYING due to market discipline. Limited liability corporations dont need it but HUMANS do.<p>And finally -- your expectations rise every decade with human progress. Do you really think we, the people living today, EARNED all the knowledge and advances and systems people invented in history who lived in the past? No, we ALL get the benefit for free. So how is your inheritance from humanity more deserved than preventing people from dying just by virtue of being human? Isnt that just... civilized?",1367713875

It's NPR-liberal, not fun loving socially open liberal, and definitely not San Francisco liberal. It's ideologically liberal but not culturally so.<p>It took me a year or two to wrap my mind around it as it's a sort of conservatism you just don't find elsewhere in the U.S. much. It took me aback. I had no conceptual framework to place it in. Eventually I realized it was an upper-crust blue blooded Ivy League thing, a bizarre hybrid where people are intellectually open minded but socially unbelievably reserved.</i><p>Coming from ""that kind"" (solidly middle-class economically, but culturally/intellectually what you described) I think that there is a fear in us of the impractical. We have a 400-year memory of weird religious fantasies, failed dreams, and dangerous frontiers. We are quite liberal, but also <i>very</i> cautious and it's bred into us. When someone tells us that he's gone ""poly"" and that he's quite fine with his ""open relationship"" (initiated by his more alpha girlfriend) we roll our eyes and see someone who got played. We have 400 years of experience with concepts far more impractical than that.<p>Also, we generally don't like taxes. We're fine with money going to important social programs (e.g. universal healthcare) of obvious value, but we're fiscally prudent and when we can't see where every dollar goes, it makes us suspicious.<p>Intellectually, I'm about as anti-conformist as it gets. But on some level, I feel like there are rules and traditions and boundaries that have some value. What I especially hate are powerful people (the current elite, who've eclipsed us, and who've outdone us economically by orders of magnitude by their willingness to associate with <i>distasteful</i> money, e.g. oil despots) who seem to have taken all the bad of our traditions (e.g. our haughtiness and faith in hierarchy) and thrown away the good (our respect for education and human dignity, our progressivism, our flair for the written word).<p>We are (as noted) terrible, as a set, at keeping in contact. This is probably why people perceive it as being hard to make friends in Boston. We will still consider a person a friend if we haven't seen him for 10 years... but we also tend to go 10 years without being in contact, which is a shame. We also go out of our way to be kind to people we barely know... but we're not exactly warm. This aloofness is certainly one of the northeastern traits I have that I don't like.",1367713534

If they can do it, others can too.<p>And if their proving it is possible opens up a new industry of downloadable codecs, that run in all web browsers regardless and on all OSes, then that sounds like something good.<p>Because it's compared to the H.264 world where no open source browser can ship the codec.

Whereas if the codec is downloadable - just another website - then both of these problems are averted.<p>I agree with you that we should and must consider the broader social implications.

5656865,comment,5656249,5656249,2,0,temphn,,,"The thing about the basic guaranteed income is that it's not usually thought through beyond the first step.<p>Let's extrapolate it out. Say you receive this income. What would you do? Perhaps you would go down to the store and purchase rice. The storekeeper has to work to manage the store, the truck driver drove the rice to market, and the rice farmer had to plant and harvest the rice.<p>A portion of your rupee today goes to the storekeeper. But a portion also diffuses back to the driver and the rice farmer. Those signals are the signals for them to keep doing what they are doing. Yes, it's true that the storekeeper bought the rice in advance of your purchase, but if you look at this as an iterated purchase: in general money flows opposite the flow of goods/services.<p>They accept your money today on the tacit belief that you have provided enough value to someone else, somewhere else that it will even out in the end when it is their turn to consume.<p>However, if the state either takes money (via tax) or centrally creates money (via inflation) to give a ""guaranteed basic income"", it is essentially forcing the store owner, truck driver, and rice farmer to work for free. The monetary signal becomes broken and no longer signals that the person on the purchasing end has produced something in return for this rice.<p>The shopkeeper, driver, and farmer don't have the vocabulary to articulate this in highfalutin', dispassionate tones. But they can understand that while they are slaving away at work, the person buying their rice is getting something for nothing. And that something is to a nontrivial extent coming directly out of their hide (in the form of taxes or monetary dilution).<p>This is why the passive voice isn't so helpful here - ""paying an unconditional basic income"" takes away the role of agency. The state is taxing citizens and forcing them to provide services to people who aren't producing anything in return (""unconditional"").<p>Different people have different definitions of justice, but many of those citizens will leave once they understand what is going on. After all, you would leave a company structured like that, which diluted down your equity or awarded an unconditional salary to the flagrantly unproductive. And so you would leave a country structured like that.<p>And when people of this sort leave en masse, there is no shopkeeper, truck driver, or rice farmer where the ""guaranteed income"" can be spent.",1367712949

The third sentence from the wikipedia article on the subject : ""On 27 February 2002, the Sabarmati Express train was attacked at Godhra by a Muslim mob.[2][3][4][5] 58 Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya were killed in the attack."" <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Gujarat_violence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Gujarat_violence</a><p>The aftermath of that is what you might expect. The rest of the article has such little tidbits as calls for genocide being broadcast from mosques, in code, which obviously means that muslims were planning a genocide beforehand (or they wouldn't have had time to spread the code).<p>The gujarat riots were an example of their standard modus operandus : small number of muslims successfully goading a large number of muslims into committing genocide, and losing the battle. I've seen groups try the same in Brussels (thankfully unsuccessfully). But don't worry, they were only trying to get muslims to shoot automatic weaponry at citizens because of graffiti on the mosque (graffiti was related to Europe). Needless to say this was officially declared ""an incident of a reaction against religious intolerance"". I even know why : because stating the truth had a good chance of making the muslims attack again.<p>Did ""both sides commit atrocities"" yes. However, one side can make a VERY strong case it was defending itself. Furthermore given all other incidents, from partition and subsequent genocide in Pakistan but not in India to the many other instances of violence, I would suspect that was the case even without the many indications in the article that this was a coordinated plan for genocide against hindus run from the local mosques that got out of hand.<p>I think you see why this is unlikely to sway my opinion. Please, do try again, because I really don't want to think islam and muslims are at war with everybody else, which can't end in anything but massive religious intolerance world-wide.

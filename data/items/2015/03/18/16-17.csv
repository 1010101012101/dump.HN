In the bit of rural Canada where I grew up, it was pretty standard for french elementary students to go on to english high school (with 1-2 classes/year in french, usually french & history or geography). We can all still speak french (with weaker vocab if we don&#x27;t practice) but we didn&#x27;t have issues with math/science jargon or having enough practice in english. A handful of students went to french high school but generally because they intended to go to a french university.",1426697997

It&#x27;s not like the transaction <i>ends</i> after purchase and the only noble thing to do is take what comes and keep my mouth shut.<p>When I buy a premium product, I expect premium support and service. Apple&#x27;s money situation is relevant because they are choosing to not cover this issue despite having the resources to address it. If they were a struggling company, I could understand the reluctance to address the issue. But this seems short-sighted.<p>Besides, Apple should be grateful that people are making a stink online, giving them a chance to address the problem honorably before it goes to the courts via a lemon law.",1426697982

The only awful thing about that is the loss of <i>revenue</i>.  And the stigmatization of the unemployed.<p>With technology that destroys more jobs than it creates, we don&#x27;t have many solutions.  We could generalise the 4 days work-week.

I get the feeling that the response to this will be &quot;a bad rating does not ensure action&quot; - but neither does a call to the public agency.<p><i>If I complain about too many taxi drivers, every other taxi driver will still pick me up.</i><p>Does Uber actually do this? They rate you immediately at drop off, presumably before you rate them. (I never got the rating prompt until after the driver had left)<p>How does the driver know of the history of your ratings of other drivers?<p><i>If there&#x27;s short term construction, or a particular corridor is always busy at an unusual time of day, my driver will already know about it, because there&#x27;s a good chance he&#x27;s been driving in this city for years.</i><p>Who the heck do you think most Uber drivers are? Taking a shot in the dark here, but probably <i>residents of the city they drive in</i>.<p><i>..And if he hasn&#x27;t, the competition to become a driver is fierce enough that he is highly motivated to be the best taxi driver he can be.</i><p>What do you think will happen to the ratings of a slow driver who makes someone late to their destination, or drives with a dirty car, or has a bad attitude? I&#x27;m going to take another shot in the dark here, but knowing what I know of the rating system, I&#x27;d wager that will get a driver drummed out of Uber a lot faster than the same behavior would get a driver dismissed from a regular taxi outfit.<p>I really do not get this argument - the feedback and ongoing quality checks by the rideshare companies is <i>necessarily</i> more immediate and more tied to actual everyday conditions and performance than the spot checks that can be performed by even the most scrupulous and well intentioned government agency.<p>Everything else you said was varying degrees of spot on.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://blog.uber.com/chicagotaxicrime"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.uber.com/chicagotaxicrime</a>",1426697563

It would be nice if enterprising people could start new routes, and then once they prove profitable then they would be turned over to the city who would use their own rolling stock to run the route.<p>This would enable the people starting the bus route to then do market analysis and use the same buses to go start yet another new route which could then either be profitable or not, and then get taken over or not.  So you&#x27;re organizing the company to take the risk and that means the city doesn&#x27;t have to, which means that some kind of progress might get made in less than a person&#x27;s lifetime.<p>Yes I do realize that profit != socially useful in all contexts.

Doing this does make it sound thick but you&#x27;ll get tired listening to an album of distortion. The bass is also distorted (a tube/valve amp in use).

Led Zeppelin is a good example because even though Led Zep 1&#x27;s drums were only recorded with 2 (or 3) microphones, there is real dynamics in the drumming (listen to how the drums come in on Good Times Bad Times). You can tell how few microphones were used because the panning on the drum fill for the toms at the end of How Many More Times pans the entire drumkit, not just the toms. Modern setups would perhaps have close-miked drums panned around the stereo image so as the drummer does a fill on the toms, it doesn&#x27;t take the entire kit with it (8 microphones for a kit, one for each drum + hi hat and overheads).",1426696313

It is here to stay. But that doesn&#x27;t mean one should stop complaining about where JavaScript falls short.<p>There are multiple angles to get out of this mess:<p>* Local optimization (trying to fix the things that can be fixed and not introducing new problems: very hard, very slow process, think quicksand).<p>* Global optimization (Dart, ClojureScript, Elm, GWT. Ambitious compile-to-js languages that give you a ton by moving away from what makes JavaScript JavaScript)<p>* And something in between like compile-to-js languages that stay closer to JavaScript like CoffeeScript, TypeScript that add to it and/or retract stuff.<p>The fascinating thing here imho is that especially the ambitious approaches to getting us out of the mess we&#x27;re in lead to faster local improvements (here just some of them) …<p>* SIMD support: Dart nudged JavaScript to add SIMD support, John McCutchan of the Dart team even worked on that<p>* Classes: Dart, TypeScript, CoffeeScript<p>* Briefer, more expressive syntax: CoffeeScript, Dart, TypeScript<p>* Optional types: Dart, TypeScript, …<p>* VM Performance: Dart<p>JavaScript got better as a language as well as a compilation target, especially in the last few months. This is great for all of us. It happened and happens because people are not satisfied with the status quo and don&#x27;t shut up about it and do what they can to go beyond what&#x27;s &#x27;good enough&#x27;.<p>The day it becomes unacceptable to criticise the status quo is the day innovation dies.

And they&#x27;re considered one of the two, if not the most, successful app store on the planet.<p>2) PCs, as opposed to mobile platforms, are open systems with a radically different distribution culture. You visit a website, click a button to launch an installer, choose a directory and go. Yes, the customer would prefer an app store, but giving MS a 30% cut when you drive all the traffic and marketing and downloads on your websites anyway? Unlikely. On Mobile there&#x27;s not much of a choice.<p>It&#x27;s obvious that a windows store will generate revenues and would be a good move. Mac and Linux have em, and if well executed on the biggest PC/Laptop platform in the world, then it can be a big deal. Just look at Steam, somehow it drives so many eyeballs that publishers are willing to give a cut to Steam to do something they&#x27;re already doing themselves on their own website easily: distribution.<p>But steam being the favorite by far, still makes between 1 and 2 billion dollars in revenue.<p>In short it&#x27;s pretty unlikely to see MS really thrive on app store revenue. It&#x27;ll be a decent product, but it&#x27;s probably more for improving the customer experience (through a properly curated store) and get people to like Windows again than to make a ton of money. For MS it seems it&#x27;s still all about selling licenses to vendors, office and enterprise/education. It&#x27;s kind of funny how extremely non B2C it is, and how B2B focused it really is, for a company that builds products used by billions of people. I think these latest moves have kind of shown MS understands that and is trying to get closer to (dealing with) the customer: build their own hardware, make their software free.",1426695322

Sure, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any firm idea of when &#x27;robotic&#x27; drivers will overtake humans in terms of safety. But it does seem pretty clear that it will eventually happen.<p>Self-driving cars have a few massive potential advantages relative to humans, such as faster reaction times, no distractions, the ability to directly communicate car-to-car, and so on. It certainly seems likely that those advantages will far outweigh the adaptability of humans – after all, aren&#x27;t most accidents caused by distraction, driving too fast for the conditions and the like?",1426694475

However, if we look at other recent SSL vulnerabilities: Heartbleed, POODLE, FREAK - most of these are all dealing with flaws in the encryption (some directly, through most with the use of side-channel or other clever attacks).<p>We also know that the NSA is saving encrypted messages for mass decryption in the future. New technologies like Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) can help eliminate this issue. I think that fact that nearly 100% of servers were still allowing SSL 3 up until the POODLE attack a few months ago highlights how poor most SSL configurations are. Unlike the trust network, which has infrequent but serious breaches, the encryption side seems to be poorly implemented almost universally.<p>However, unlike Superfish, which we know affected thousands, alot of these other SSL vulnerabilities are usually just PoCs...<p>A complex issue for sure.",1426694434

Chances are good that someone simply isn&#x27;t aware of the community standards as to when they are and when they are not supposed to downvote - that downvotes are meant to be reserved for when a comment adds no value to the conversation, not when one simply disagrees with the opinion being shared.  In that case, the person needs to be educated to the community&#x27;s expectations.

7708633,comment,7708251,7708251,2,0,yoklov,,,"There&#x27;s some good and bad advice here.<p>Avoiding (or at least thinking about) branches, avoiding mallocs, and simplifying equations out by hand before you code them are all hugely worthwhile. Thinking about the memory usage access patterns of your program is a must if you work in realtime simulations. (Simplifying equations is enormously important, and I&#x27;m glad to see it mentioned because most people assume that the compiler can do it for them, which in most cases it cannot).<p>OTOH much of this advice won&#x27;t make any difference other than making you code harder to read. Using local variables won&#x27;t increase register pressure compared to not using a variable for that computation.  Very few compilers will actually generate temporary objects for `Vec3 res = Vec3(a, b, c) + Vec3(d, e, f) + Vec3(h, i, j)`. As I understand it, using memset vs letting the compiler zero initialize an array of classes is unnecessary unless you compile with `-fno-strict-aliasing` or similar.<p>For small programs, rolling your own STL data structures isn&#x27;t the worst advice, especially given that his target audience seems to be students (I work in gamedev, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to work with someone who couldn&#x27;t code up a STL-like templated vector, exception safety aside). Neither is avoiding templates (at least, before you can tell by looking what kind of code a complex template will expand to).<p>Anyway, for better, more thorough, and more actionable advice, there&#x27;s always [Agner Fog&#x27;s excellent guide to optimizing C++ programs](<a href=""http://www.agner.org/optimize/optimizing_cpp.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.agner.org/optimize/optimizing_cpp.pdf</a>).

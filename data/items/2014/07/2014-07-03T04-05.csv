As a random sample, I just put the 15 miles between Lakewood to Carson into Google Maps and the transit routes start at 2 hours each way, even during peak hours! It&#x27;s a 20 minute drive.<p>A major challenge for people living with limited means is how much slower life is when they&#x27;re dependent on public transit to get around.

After extensive analysis of relevant case law and the history of the United States they conclude:<p><i>Border searches, then, from before the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, have been considered to be &quot;reasonable&quot; by the single fact that the person or item in question had entered into our country from outside. There has never been any additional requirement that the reasonableness of a border search depended on the existence of probable cause. This longstanding recognition that searches at our borders without probable cause and without a warrant are nonetheless &quot;reasonable&quot; has a history as old as the Fourth Amendment itself.  We reaffirm it now.</i><p><a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/431/606"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/431/606</a><p>Reasonable people can disagree with the Supreme Court on whether their application of the Constitution is as broad or narrow as it should be in any particular circumstance, but it is fairly clear that they did not write &quot;The Constitution does not apply at the border!&quot;",1404363333

If I don&#x27;t like the color of the text in the tree view, I can change that, just by writing CSS.  It&#x27;s an editor by the web, for the web, and <i>of</i> the web.<p>Sublime, however, feels much more fluid.  When I open a file in the tree view, it animates down (have yet to get that working properly with Atom - it animates but it looks choppy). It&#x27;s faster, for obvious reasons.  The themes I have in place look damn good, and I have a git package that can show me a diff of the file I&#x27;m looking at (oddly, Atom lacks this feature).<p>I very much look forward to following Atom and maybe in a year or two, if they&#x27;ve gotten it up to a level of performance I can tolerate, I&#x27;ll give it another shot.<p>Ultimately, right now the choice is between the performance and usability of Sublime, vs the aesthetics of Atom.  Sublime&#x27;s performance actually gives it a bit of an aesthetic edge over Atom, so despite the hackability of Atom&#x27;s UI, it&#x27;s just not there... yet.<p>I&#x27;d love to make the switch, but the subtle (though perceptible) UI lags and smaller ecosystem make it a subpar choice right now.",1404363287
7981504,comment,7980403,7981182,18,0,dang,,,"I know you&#x27;re talking about product launches, but you reminded me of something I&#x27;ve been wanting to clarify about Show HN. I hope it&#x27;s ok if I share it here. It&#x27;s not exactly off-topic, since Show HN is definitely for product launches—but it&#x27;s for other things too.<p>The way Show HN has evolved over the years, the bar for it is naturally low. Show HN is for something you&#x27;ve made that other people can try out and talk with you about in the thread. That can be anything from a first project or weekend hack to a feedback-honed product like you&#x27;ve described above. The only rules are (a) you made it and (b) it works.<p>By &quot;it works&quot; I mean that it isn&#x27;t a landing page or an email signup or a fundraiser, but rather something other people can play with and give feedback and ask questions about. That definitely includes new products, but also other things. Who knows what people might come up with! It just has to be interesting.<p>A risk with setting the bar too high is that some users will feel like contributing isn&#x27;t for them. We want to avoid that. There are many talented people who maybe haven&#x27;t done anything of their own yet, or haven&#x27;t yet shared what they&#x27;ve done, or who suffer from that curse of our field, impostor syndrome. It&#x27;s painfully easy to look at the polished work of others and think, &quot;I could never do that&quot;. One reason we want Show HN to be welcoming to all levels of work is so there will be plenty of examples where people think, &quot;I could do that&quot;. Not as in &quot;meh, that&#x27;s nothing,&quot; but in the DIY spirit of &quot;hey, me too&quot;.<p>But the main reason is that many kinds of things—including seemingly trivial things—can be interesting. There&#x27;s a secret relationship between the high and the low. They thrive together.<p>Masterful paintings are wonderful but first sketches are interesting too, especially in a workshop or a studio, which is the kind of place we want HN to be. Besides, first sketches have a way of turning into something masterful later. Most won&#x27;t, but some will, and we love it when HN helps that happen.",1404363258

(Possibly an NLP book)<p>A University professor asked students to solve an anagram. After they were done, they had to walk into the professor&#x27;s office to tell him the word. In his office he&#x27;d be pretending to have a conversation with a visitor.<p>The words the the students had to solve were either positive, negative or neutral.<p>The result was that students that had a negative word, were far more likely to interrupt the professor&#x27;s conversation with the visitor more quickly than students that had a positive or neutral word.<p>After the students told the professor the word, he asked the students if they believed the word had an impact on their emotion.

2767058,comment,2766076,2766982,4,0,econgeeker,,,"Certainly there is more awareness of gold in the USA than there was in the 1990s.  On political radio- conservative or liberal- you hear ""buy gold!"" advertising.  I've been hearing those ads going back, at least, to 2005!  They were there in between the mortgage refinance ads back in the day.  On TV you see people pitching ""investment grade"" and ""rare"" gold coins.  They think numismatics are the way to go, and they are charging too much money.  I've seen that since the 1990s.  I bet the amounts of both of these kinds of marketing of gold is up significantly in the last 10 years.<p>All around Europe, eastern and western europe, I've seen lots of signs at money changers and some banks who are happy to sell you gold.  These signs are generally posters in the windows, not metal signs or painted, so this gives me the impression this is a new phenomena. I was very happy to see these signs, given my experience in the USA.<p>In the USA, if you want to buy gold, you can spend way too much to buy it on the TV. Or you can go to one of the few local retailers who sell bullion - but generally their primary business is either selling collectable coins or selling jewelry.  The bullion is a side business.  Unless things have changed in the last year, it is a pain in the ass to buy gold in the USA.  There may be one or two of these bullion dealers in a larger sized town.  You can't just go to the money changer or the bank.<p>I gave you several reasons for my perspective. Consider them critically. But if you're looking for someone to agree with you, and tell you I'm a dirty rotten capitalist who is full of it, you'll have no trouble finding that.<p>I would strongly recommend that you not rely on my opinion, or that of the ""hive mind"" or anyone else to make any sort of financial decisions.   You have to use your own judgement and you have to learn what you can about the subject.   This is why I said, ""If I'm wrong, I'll be punished""-- the market will take one action or the other, long after this conversation is finished.<p>I would suggest reading economics books such as ""Economics in one lesson"" by Henry Hazlitt  Free here: <a href=""http://www.hacer.org/pdf/Hazlitt00.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hacer.org/pdf/Hazlitt00.pdf</a><p>By all means, keep a critical eye on anything anyone says in favor -- or opposed-- to gold.  That is why I read what you said and considered it seriously.  I'm keenly looking for evidence of a bubble, and you referenced a metric I use.<p>I'd also recommend looking a bit into the history of gold, preferably by reading articles here: <a href=""http://mises.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org</a><p>Here's the short summary, see if this fits with what you know of the world:\nGold is historically been the best form of money because it was difficult to counterfeit, had reasonable value per given weight, was malleable, didn't degrade, etc.  But governments want to spend more than they have, so they choose paper currencies over gold.  The nice thing about paper is that they can make it ""money"" by passing a law, forcing people to use it... and they can print as much as they want. The downside is, they get addicted to this spending, and in doing so, they always need to spend more and more.  The more paper there is in circulation the more pieces of paper it takes to buy anything tangible, and prices rise, which means costs rise for the governments and they need to print paper at an even faster rate.<p>These effects take a very long time to play out. They ultimately result in a currency crisis, however.   Gold is merely something that is difficult to counterfeit, and it is difficult to bring new mines into production.  So it serves as a hedge against currencies.<p>I don't think there's ever been a gold bubble.  When gold has gone up in response to a currency, really it is the value of the currency declining with respect to gold.  The amount of gold in the world doesn't change very fast- it can't- at least in terms of currencies, and thus really the ""gold price"" is the ""price of the currency in units of gold.""   $1,580 is not a gold price, it is a measure of the value of the dollar.",1310731028

We use multi-master replication (perhaps also known as optimistic replication) with our own tools throughout, but it does require careful design - keep as much data as immutable as possible, every piece of data that might be updated by different machines at the same time should have its own row, GUIDs on each row.<p>Each machine can generate its own local IDs, which look a lot like a timestamp with some unique stuff on the end. Each row gets a GUID and a 'version' ID column, and we only update relayed database updates if the incoming version is newer. This is largely last-timestamp-wins for the case of conflicts (rare because of design decisions), but there is some Lamport timestamp behaviour in there too for updating a existing row.<p>The main downside is still that all machines need to handle every write, but with batching up incoming processing into larger transactions, we've had no problems with quite a number of database updates on a dozen commodity machines. Obviously filtering into different shards would be an easy solution.<p>I'm looking forward to seeing what other people are doing with multi-master replication.",1310730304

Lots of smart scientists really believed that once the human genome was sequenced, we would have the keys to the biological kingdom. What has actually happened is that we have discovered that the complexity of the system is probably an order of magnitude more complex than previously thought. Knowing the sequence of a gene turns out to be important, but a pretty minor factor in explaining its function. Plus we are learning that all sorts of simple rules we thought were true aren't always the case.<p>I suspect a similar thing is playing out in neuroscience. As we peel back the layers of the onion, ever more complexity will be revealed. The things Ray Kurzweil predicts may well come true. He is a brilliant guy. But the timetable is very optimistic.<p>The march of biological progress is very slow, in part because all the experimentation involves living things that grow, die, get contaminated, run away, don't show up for appointments, get high, etc...

I resorted to always outputting the current UTC time into a javascript variable and using that to calibrate the local computer time (again, never trusting client time)<p>* never use time.time() to get a timestamp back because it will munge the value and re-add tz info<p>* in Javascript, to go from your server-provided UTC timestamp to a local date object that you can then work with, use:<p><pre><code>    > new Date(1310728084 * 1000).toUTCString()\n    ""Fri, 15 Jul 2011 11:08:04 GMT""\n</code></pre>\n* If you are providing an API or a feed, please include a UTC timestamp in the output - parsing all the different date formats and timestamp info and attempting to work out when something happen (such as when a post was published) is a real pain in the ass. store the timezone in a sep field called 'utc_offset' or similar",1310729806

Walmart doesn't chase ""the super rich"" they actually chase the bottom end of the market.  They make good money by doing their darndest to make prices as low as possible, both to increase volume (and marketshare) but also to cater to the market that doesn't have a lot of disposable income.<p>I don't see the problem here as a lack of ""equality"", in fact, the super rich are taxed more than the poor.  If things were equal they'd all pay the same <i>dollar</i> amount (not even the same percentage, the same amount in absolute terms.)  That would be more moral as well.<p>The reasons those with less money have trouble affording things is that they have been impoverished by government.  Presume you're at the lower tax bracket and paying %15 to the IRS.  You're paying another %15 to Social Security (though only half is reported on your check, you have to earn the other half as well or you wouldn't have your job.) You're paying- what %4 to medicare? %3 for unemployment insurance, say %5 in state income taxes (just picking a low number since some states don't have it and it varies.)  That's %42 of your income right off the bat.<p>Now if you're just scraping by, that means you're spending all of the remaining %58! All of that is taxed at rates from %8 (city sales tax) to %30 (cable, phone, an flights) to as much as %40 (gasoline).<p>If we take the lowest figure there, %8, then that means of every $100 that person makes, government takes %50.   It is worse fro people in the middle and lower middle incomes.  Their state and federal income taxes are higher.<p>That's why people have trouble making ends meet.",1310729779

I had some prior exposure to Clojure (although not recent), Python (what I usually use for many of my personal projects), and Haskell. Trying to use an unfamiliar language for a fairly serious project in a group setting like this was something of an experiment in itself.<p>This lead to a lot of the sorts of problems that you face when you're just learning a new environment. As such, most of the code is probably not idiomatic Lisp, although we picked up enough to get something written fairly quickly. A lot of the places where things like macros or functional programming could have been used to simplify things were missed due to lack of familiarity with the way things are done in Lisp. Looking back on my input code for example, there's an enormous amount of repetition that I could probably factor out -- and that would have been quite handy around week 8 or 9 of the project, since I needed to extend the controls. One feature that we found quite handy though were multimethods.<p>We didn't have too many problems with performance once the game was running, although we were running mostly on fairly decent machines.

That is, instead of alerting consumers to bad credit card charges, alert merchants to bad consumers.<p>For instance, there are consumers who if they decide they no longer what to subscribe to your service don't bother trying to cancel--they just call their bank and claim they don't recognize the charge, and so generate a chargeback to the merchant. (This is bad for the merchant because not only do they have to give back the money, they get hit with a charge back fee in the $15-30 range...in fact they get hit with the fee even if the successfully challenge the charge back).<p>The idea would be when merchants make a sale, they would report to the service a hash of the credit card number, the amount of the charge, what kind of merchant they are, what kind of good or service was purchased, whether this was an initial charge or part of a recurring service, and whether the charge was accepted or declined. If a customer of theirs charges back or refunds, the merchant would report that, and whether or not it was reasonable.<p>From this data, the service could develop a profile for each card concerning its refund and charge back behavior. The service could also develop a profile of the merchants, noting merchants that have unusually high charge back and refund rates, and so weight data from those merchants less when developing the card profiles.<p>Merchants, before accepting a credit card, could query the service and get a report on that card's charge back and refund behavior.<p>One might note that some of this seems similar to the systems the banks already have in place to detect fraud. It is, but those systems are not for the benefit of the merchant. They are primarily for the bank's protection and secondarily for the consumer's protection.

Then chemical methods improved, and people came to understand that neurotransmitters played a role too, which led to antidepressants and other drugs.

2766939,comment,2766076,2766825,8,0,econgeeker,,,"It is true that in a bubble everyone is telling you to buy. But I don't think we're in a bubble for the gold price for a couple reasons. The first is that most people with an unsophisticated financial perspective (eg: hair dressers) are not aware of gold (in the countries I've visited.)  The slightly sophisticated (Eg: people who invest in mutual funds) have been claiming there was a gold bubble going all the way back to when it was only $400 an ounce.<p>But the other reason is we haven't seen gold take leave of the fundamentals.  The financial crisis that has been unfolding since 2008 has revealed that the only response governments seem willing to take is ever more monetary inflation.  The more money out there, the higher the price of gold.  Secondly, most gold trading is at the level of very sophisticated people, not the average joe.  When average joes start piling in and blowing up the price, then gold may take leave of its fundamentals and we'll have a bubble.<p>The thing is, in bubbles, supply rushes in to meet demand-- but you cant' scale up supply of gold like you can dotcoms or houses.   Environemntal regulations and kleptocratic governments keep new mine production opportunities limited.<p>Finally, mining companies-- which should be the darlings of the gold bubble if there is one-- are trading sympathetic with the rest of the stock market, not contrary to it.  If we were in a gold bubble, then good news for gold (eg: bad financial news) would cause those prices to go up-- but they don't they go down now.  This indicates that they are not seen as an alternative, but as being subject to the bad news the same way General Electric, et. al. are.<p>We won't enter a bubble phase until that has changed.  When people start seeing gold as a safer asset (or as a bull market ""you just gotta get into!"") then we'll have entered a bubble.  At that point, when there's bad news for General Electric, you'll see a bump in the price of GoldCorp.  We saw this in the dotcom bubble-- a big IPO for a tech company would cause a decline in General Electric or Gold for that matter.<p>All of these are subjective observations, so neither of us can really prove the other wrong of course.   I found it interesting is that we use the same signal to detect a bubble-- the hair dressers and MLM schemes.  I'm impressed to see how much more popular gold is outside the USA than it is inside the USA.  I take that as a sign that it is heading towards a bull market.<p>However, if you're right and I'm wrong, I will be very severely punished by the markets.  I'm not too worried, though.  I got punished by the dotcoms.  I played the housing bubble successfully going up and going down and got out a bit early, but am happy with the result.<p>I remember being told I was crazy on forums because I said there was a bubble in housing.  So, you're not crazy, I just think you're too early.",1310727658

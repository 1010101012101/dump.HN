6357875,comment,6357317,6357586,10,0,kaitai,,,"That is also terrible teaching. A good teacher sets up a productive classroom environment from the beginning, with expectations set out in words and also modeled in behavior (calling on a wide variety of students, modeling how to ask questions about a student&#x27;s thoughts, modeling how to give praise and criticism, giving a continual example of how to work through problems). When issues like negative interaction between students come up it&#x27;s easy enough to set up a group work lesson that separates problem personalities, put people in groups with supportive folks, leave alone students who want to be left alone and try to channel energy in the right direction. I&#x27;ve worked with nerdy teenage boys and socially awkward types of all genders, and it&#x27;s a matter of skill to deal with this but that is after all the job!<p>For instance, I had a student (13 yrs old?) in an advanced math class that was all male (I&#x27;m female) and he had a habit of starting to blurt out mildly veiled sexual comments to me. I said a few things to him about what was appropriate in class, in a kind way and privately, and I also arranged for a male administrator to chat with him. It stopped. Grades have nothing to do with this -- they&#x27;re not effective in any way in setting classroom tone, especially as they&#x27;re feedback far after the semester ends.<p>I&#x27;m sorry for all these Hacker News readers who had shitty high school experiences, but you do need to grow up and realize they were shitty. Turning around to dump the shit downhill -- or indulging in some sort of Stockholm syndrome -- is not going to make the world a better place and it does not make you a better person.<p>I don&#x27;t always do things perfectly; I remember one female student who was being aggressively and unwillingly courted by a football player in one of my classes and I wasn&#x27;t able to prevent all the distraction. But I noticed and did what I could, and commented to them separately about what is and isn&#x27;t alright in the classroom. Seriously, folks, it&#x27;s not that hard to have expectations for appropriate behavior and enforce them.",1378781993

6357868,comment,6354649,6355497,7,0,droithomme,,,"For 10 key entry in accounting you want the most often used numbers closest to you. Benford&#x27;s Law explains why 1 is the most common digit, followed by 2, 3, etc. Thus for hand entry, small digits should be closest to the hand, at the bottom, and larger digits at top.<p>For dialing a phone you are not constantly dialing numbers as a accountant or data entry person will be doing. For phoning, the number 1 is not the most common one, it&#x27;s was actually more rare in old numbers which reserved 1 and 0 in some positions for area codes, needed only for long distance. The user testing showed that top to bottom order worked better for users than bottom to top. Undoubtedly since it matched reading order of the english language, going top to bottom as well.<p>The most efficient and least error prone layout depends on the task.

I feel for the parent who sees her daughter possibly reject a very fulfilling career path after a bad initial experience, when the future could be so much better. But as a former high school teacher, I also feel for the teacher. Giving them some benefit of the doubt, I just want to point out a couple things:<p>1. As many others have mentioned, if this is a public school, it&#x27;s quite unlikely that this teacher is college educated as a programmer, let alone has ever been a professional developer. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re teaching VB simply because that&#x27;s what they have experience with, probably making them the most experienced programmer on staff at the school.<p>2. High school bullies are typically quite good at restricting their bullying to times when they&#x27;re unlikely to be spotted by an authority figure. As a teacher, you try hard to maintain awareness of the entire room as much as possible, but there are always tons of gaps. You might be writing something on the board, helping a student 1-on-1, addressing some other kid&#x27;s behavior, or doing any of dozens of other tasks.<p>3. Most teachers try to keep tabs on their students on a personal level, especially when they behavior or attitude noticeably changes, but not all students open up. It takes <i>a lot</i> of effort to maintain an authentic connection. Parents have trouble connecting authentically with their children--imagine doing it with scores of students per semester. And when it comes to bullying, most teenagers downplay to avoid being though of as a snitch. Some are self-conscious to be bailed out even when they haven&#x27;t &quot;snitched&quot;.<p>4. For many of the author&#x27;s suggestions, the teacher may be doing these things (recruiting, cross-promoting, etc.), to the extent that they have time. But these are outside the job of teaching. These are things the author could be doing at the school too, but presumably she&#x27;s too busy. I&#x27;m sure the teacher can relate.<p>Teaching high school was by far the most grueling and emotionally taxing job I&#x27;ve ever had. My work career also includes being a custodian at a health club, a baseball umpire, a senior software engineer, and and a startup founder. None of those jobs is anywhere near as demanding.",1378781102

This is because you have to do double integration to get distance and the errors only accumulates. My guess is that they have used algorithms like SIFT to track points in space and estimate only small relative distances from sensors (gyro + accelerators). This is however is very cool.

If it&#x27;s somebody I care about that I&#x27;m close to, or if it&#x27;s myself, often I will ask about and validate associated feelings with the hope but not the expectation that it loosens whatever strongly held stance a little bit.

You&#x27;re implicitly subsidizing a select few - then who gets to be the gatekeeper that decides what is or isn&#x27;t bad?  Surely not, people who are selected because of their high training, where &quot;high training&quot; winds up also being indirectly judged as &quot;people who were trained by the closed society of individuals who just happen to be the selectees&quot;?<p>I mean, really, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing.  As the system becomes more closed and self-interested, and dependent on extracting funds from the government, the more the danger of becoming detached from reasonableness - and then you DO have to worry about people tickling their intellectual jollies.<p>Now, if we had the very same system, except it were funded as, say a private non-profit entity, it will for sure have the same problems.  But - it&#x27;s less morally suspect, because, at least the people donating their money into it should have known that risk beforehand - and can choose to directly defund their part in the rotten enterprise when they figure out what&#x27;s going on.<p>> Punishing risk-taking just because you&#x27;re worried about somebody tickling their &quot;intellectual jollies&quot; is rather short-sighted.<p>You&#x27;re absolutely right.  But that choice is not one that <i>government</i> should be making, because of its conflict of interest (accountability).  Incidentally, there are problems with transparency in government funding reviews (NSF and NIH panels are conducted in secret with &#x27;anonymous reviewers&#x27;), too, but those are implementation details, not fundamental problems.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that the risk-taking involved in judging basic science <i>should not be done</i>.

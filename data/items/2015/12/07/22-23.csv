I (an American) eat &quot;ethnic&quot; foods regularly: Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, Thai, Indian, Hispanic, etc.  I generally love ethnic foods.  The exception is sweets.  There are a few ethnic sweets I&#x27;ve had that I like, but by and large I&#x27;ve found, e.g., Indian and Chinese sweets to be unpleasant.  Some of them I find to be nearly unpalatable.  Others just taste odd.<p>I doubt I&#x27;m the only person with this experience.  Lots of &quot;ethnic&quot; foods have been modified to fit the American palate (see General Tso&#x27;s Chicken), and exposure to ethnic entrees also does not imply much exposure to ethnic sweets.",1449529126

10693400,comment,10691804,10691804,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I believe that man-made CO2 emissions likely have a significant impact on the climate, and we should do something about it, but even so the issue is a very complex one and its politicization hasn&#x27;t helped. Here&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not so easy:<p>1. The data is crap. What you need is average temperatures and other data (humidity, pressure, cloud cover, albedo, etc.) over the entire Earth down to a fairly small scale. What we have is a mismash of horribly calibrated weather station data near cities combined with limited satellite data and various proxies, all of which has to be massaged a great deal to make it usable. Sea level data has the same sort of problems, nearly impossible to properly calibrate to sufficient precision. The fact that people have poured tons of effort into collecting and attempting to calibrate data doesn&#x27;t mean the data is actually very good.<p>2. The models are also crap. A century ago Svante Arrhenius came up with the greenhouse effect theory and did some back of the envelope calculations on its magnitude, coming up with a figure of climate sensitivity of about 2 deg. C per CO2 doubling. Today all of our vaunted climate modelling hasn&#x27;t managed to come up with a more accurate figure than that. Current estimates are still &quot;maybe 2 deg. C per doubling, with some enormous error bars&quot;. Modern models have several problems. The conceit is that climate models are de novo elaborations from first principles and are as rock solid as our understanding of the laws of physics. In practice all climate models contain multiple &quot;empirically determined&quot; fudge factors. They <i>fit</i> the data, they don&#x27;t <i>predict</i> it. And that&#x27;s assuming we even had enough good data to really run good prediction checks, which is dubious at best.<p>3. The climatology scientific community is very problematic. There is little indication of sufficient rigor, and criticizing results is an easy way to get effectively excommunicated from the community. Take, for example, the famed &quot;hockey stick&quot; paper, which has now been thoroughly discredited, but all of the discrediting happened effectively &quot;behind the scenes&quot; and quietly. Science works best when it&#x27;s open and boisterous. It&#x27;s surprising that climatology isn&#x27;t in even worse state given how insular and political it is.<p>4. Even if we assumed that man-made carbon emissions were going to cause a huge degree of global warming there is still a huge gap between that fact and figuring out what to do about it, which many folks simply skip over. The actual damage (to the biosphere and to human activities) is just as difficult to determine as the climate is to predict. The right course of action to take depends a great deal on lots of different factors: sociological, technological, and economic. Especially since a lot of the CO2 production of the 21st century will come from economies that are climbing out of poverty and into affluence. It may well be the smartest choice to simply continue polluting until the world is richer and more technologically advanced and then consider mitigation strategies.<p>4a. CO2 emissions may not be, and likely is not, the most important pollution issue everywhere in the world currently. But it gets the most attention and sometimes that makes it more difficult to get traction on other issues.<p>Meanwhile, there really are serious &quot;climate change denialists&quot; and some of the folks on that side are absolutely terrible. Canadian PM Harper banned government scientists from talking to the press, for example. But the answer to science being perverted for political reasons isn&#x27;t to simply pervert it in the opposite direction to compensate.<p>It&#x27;s just a complete shit-show across the board and I&#x27;m not happy with how any of it is being handled at either the level of scientific inquiry or public policy.",1449528631

I don&#x27;t see your point.<p>When the authorities recently raided various domiciles and Mosques in France, they found a bunch of weapons.  Including some stashed in a Mosque.  They found extremist propaganda.  Some of the Paris attackers were known to police (&quot;fiche S&quot;).<p>Up until now, they let these people be.  Maybe they assumed they wouldn&#x27;t actually carry out their radical desires.  It&#x27;s hard to believe no one in their community knew about their radicalism.  They were given a chance to sort it out themselves.  The west has been tolerant enough of those with divergent beliefs, assuming that they&#x27;ll eventually assimilate.<p>> Now, how that in any way reflects on the responsibility of say my father, who stays awake at night because he can&#x27;t sleep, saddened about the loss of innocent life due to the recent terrorist attacks (I&#x27;m not making up a sob story here, take it how you want it), a man who happens to be a muslim, is beyond me.<p>Is his son a terrorist?

What is &#x27;fair&#x27; and &#x27;just&#x27; in life is different than reality.  Is it fair that innocent French people died in the Bataclan?  Is it fair that Muslims died in the Bataclan (because there WERE Muslim names on the list of the dead).  Is it fair that most of ISIS&#x27; victims are Muslims?  Is it fair that Saudi Arabia is beheading and dropping bombs on Shias?<p>Today, just now, Donald Trump called for no Muslims to be allowed into the US.  Is that fair?  Yesterday, the Front National had a very strong result in France, and they propose much of the same (if not worse).<p>I&#x27;m calling for some sort of responsibility on the part of Muslims for people who become radicalised within their communities.  Maybe some of my posts are controversial and maybe I use too much hyperbole.  Maybe I&#x27;m too cynical about the world.<p>But the rise of the FN, and other extreme-right parties does have a precedent in history.  It is history repeating itself.

And even if you add tighter tolerances to the spec you can still end up with things not working properly.<p>Not to mention that increased tolerances means higher costs and there&#x27;s a point where you can&#x27;t adhere to them physically and as far as real world manufacturing goes the tighter your tolerances are the tighter the control and QA needs to be which results only in diminishing returns.<p>When you end up manufacturing things tolerances can be skewed by a 100 different reasons from a slightly different zero and certification process to different CAD/CNC software which rounds up thing slightly differently.\nThe ISS development actually learned quite a few things with that and they&#x27;ve both adjusted their process segmented the manufacturing by entire modules rather than individual parts then the only thing you need to really worry about are the tolerances for the actual dock which have quite a bit of wiggle room.\nIf you had to make the frame for the cupola in Italy, the outer housing in France the Windows in Germany, the Shutters in the Netherlands and assemble them in the UK you would ended up with similar problems.<p>Saying there&#x27;s nothing wrong with X you just need a better process can be said for pretty much everything but that argument rarely holds water when you deal with real world applications, there&#x27;s a reason why there are entire engineering disciplines for manufacturing and process control.<p>So no as an Engineer you need to design tolerances not for the worse case scenario but for the actual manufacturing process you are using and the controls you can enact on that process.\nWhen that process is then spread out across as many parties as possible it&#x27;s no longer the process you&#x27;ve started with and quite likely isn&#x27;t neither and ideal process nor one you could ever really optimize.<p>There&#x27;s a good reason why some of the worlds most advanced engineering parts are still quite often hand fitted at the end, and that&#x27;s when you work with a single manufacturing process in a single factory.\nWhen you spread that out you end up with parts that sometimes can&#x27;t even be hand fitted anymore.",1449526421

Any given organism&#x27;s species is determined by the relative genetic distance between it and the species exemplars.<p>Under this regime, if we postulate a new species <i>Homo superior</i> with, for instance, the mutant ability to read and write text messages while also being fully aware of its surroundings, the earliest known bearer of the mutant gene would likely be chosen as the exemplar.  If this person died and was not preserved in any way, we might be able to reconstruct a model of their genome via gene sequencing analyses, which would clearly show the mutant gene.<p>It would hybridize with <i>Homo sapiens</i>, the parent species.  Children lacking the mutant gene would be indistinguishable from H. sapiens.  Children with it would clearly be able to trace lineage to the exemplar.<p>Without barriers to breeding, the new species might just invisibly replace the parent species as a non-branching successor.  In this case, we might just let it keep the same species name, and retcon the original mutation into the appearance of a subspecies.<p>The fossil record makes selection of exemplars easier, because in many cases, only one instance even exists.  Only one tooth found in Denisov cave.  Only one Taung skull found.<p>If there is no gene in <i>Canis rufus</i> that is unique to a single species exemplar, there is no unique species left.  Even if it ever was its own species, having a purely theoretical exemplar with only a few known genes, <i>right now</i> it is just a <i>lupus-latrans</i> hybrid.<p>So for me, a species would be defined by the presence of one or more specific genes.  Those genes could be determined by sequencing DNA from actual remains, or inferred by analysis of living members of the species.<p>Being able to interbreed fertile offspring seems to me to be more like a <i>genus</i>-level thing, because that seems pretty common in plants.",1449526400

Regardless of whether or not you agree with the science, taking it seriously is a logical choice.<p>The plausible worst-case scenario of charging ahead with measures to combat climate change isn&#x27;t actually that bad, not to mention the ancillary benefits outlined by Schwarzenegger. Aggressively stimulating the renewables economy would be a death knell for the fossil-fuel industry, which could harm the overall economy (though renewables would also contribute positively). It would be disruptive to sections of the country that are dependent upon the fossil-fuel industry (coal country in Kentucky, for instance), which would be very hard on the people living there. This is certainly bad and should not be done lightly, but it&#x27;s hardly apocalyptic.<p>The plausible worst-case scenario of failing to address climate change is _really_ bad, ranging from property destruction all the way to civilizational collapse or even potentially human extinction[1]. In a world with nuclear weapons, large-scale destabilization resulting from famine, drought and loss of land to flooding is a very dangerous thing.

But for the record, Breivik has said a lot of things, indeed that he was not a religious man, indeed allegiance to Odin, but also statements like &#x27;I consider myself to be 100 percent Christian.&#x27; He contradicted himself on many different occasions, but it&#x27;d be myopic to say he has never identified himself as a Christian. Again though, I don&#x27;t care and certainly don&#x27;t see him as a Christian terrorist, I was just using it for material for my joke to show how silly your reasoning is.<p>Anyway, on to more important things. You bring up aiding and abetting multiple times and then end your post. I don&#x27;t see your point. Well I do but it&#x27;s so wrong that I&#x27;m left wondering if you were trying to make another point.<p>The point you&#x27;re making is &#x27;sometimes people who indirectly are responsible for a crime, get convinced&#x27;. And that&#x27;s true, and that&#x27;s good. If you drive a getaway car for a bank robber or murderer, you&#x27;re responsible.<p>Now, how that in any way reflects on the responsibility of say my father, who stays awake at night because he can&#x27;t sleep, saddened about the loss of innocent life due to the recent terrorist attacks (I&#x27;m not making up a sob story here, take it how you want it), a man who happens to be a muslim, is beyond me. He has zero connection with these attacks, never condoned it, never supported it, never saw any indication it happened. He&#x27;s simply a decent muslim, in no way different from any other, who let his own son grow up an atheist without ever making a fuss. Your idea to punish him by mere association on the basis of his religious beliefs, is again, something you&#x27;d expect from the terrorists you&#x27;re so against. Further, it strengthens the very strategy that IS has, which is to recruit a billion muslims by scaring the world into resorting to medieval instruments like collective punishment of muslims you suggest, creating systems of apartheid based on religious beliefs, and pitting people like my dad against people like myself.<p>Collective punishment is a very distinct idea. It&#x27;s not punishing the crime of aiding and abetting which is a normal and useful part of virtually every justice system on earth. Collective punishment is specifically punishing those with innocent associations. How you can not see the difference is beyond me. Next when a man does something, all men must be punished. When a black person does something, all blacks must be punished. When a computer engineer does something, all engineers must be punished. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m talking to a child with all due respect, defending collective punishment is an idea silly beyond reason. Some of the worst atrocities have happened under the guise of collective punishment and the world has created laws against it for this very reason.<p>Lastly I&#x27;ll finish with this, and I hope you&#x27;ll be convinced then. Because you must see the irony... to punish innocent people, merely because they&#x27;re associated under an umbrella (a very wide umbrella, amongst which one may find many differences) of islamic faith, is to do exactly what some terrorists have done in the past... Terrorists have attacked and punished innocent people in the west, merely for their association with the west, whose governments have been responsible for various atrocities in the world. They have collectively punished and murdered innocent people on the basis of this association, including ordinary folks who resisted these atrocities, voted and marched against them, as well as punished kids who had no say in the matter. That&#x27;s collective punishment, it&#x27;s insane, it&#x27;s immoral, and you&#x27;re a supporter. I hate to throw a terrorist-supporter card on the table, but you&#x27;re asking for one.",1449525795

7160487,comment,7159926,7159926,14,0,deathanatos,,,"It&#x27;s the type data that makes this hard: JSON has no support for encoding new types into the serialization. This is a blessing and a curse: it makes JSON simple, but also inflexible.<p>Take this parting remark:<p>> So, here’s another thing I wanna add to my suggestion: consider adapting ISO 8601 for a default JSON serialization of DateTime, so the following just works:<p>> var dt = DateTime.parse(&quot;2014-01-26T11:38:17&quot;);<p>> print(JSON.encode(dt));<p>Ignoring the fact that it&#x27;s a simple value you&#x27;re attempting to encode to JSON, let&#x27;s say this works. Do you get:<p><pre><code>  &quot;2014-01-26T11:38:17&quot;\n</code></pre>\nNow do to the reverse: what does that decode to? Either it decodes to a string, and you&#x27;ve lost the type information, or it decodes to a date, in which case, what does `JSON.encode(&quot;2014-01-26T11:38:17&quot;)` decode to? i.e., do strings sometimes decode to dates? What if someone uses what should be a string to cause the decoder to decode it as a date? Now anywhere you have a string, it might decode to a date!<p>YAML has support for this sort of thing, with a syntax like `!!date &quot;2014-01-26T11:38:17&quot;`. (If you want a literal `!!`, it&#x27;s always `&quot;!!&quot;`.) Notably, the Python library for YAML <i>can</i> do what the author asks: encode and decode arbitrary objects. (but it turns out to be a security risk to do so on untrusted data.)<p>> The Dart editor should be able to display a JSON serialization of anything the mouse pointer touches.<p>If my class contains a file handle, what&#x27;s the JSON representation of a file handle? Further, if I send that serialization across the wire, how do you deserialize it? I mention this because you can&#x27;t, at least, not really. Python&#x27;s `repr` is a good example here. When it can, it gives you close-to Python syntax for the object, such as strings (`&quot;hello world&quot;`), ints (`1`), decimals (`Decimal(3)`), etc. Perfect for debugging. For things it can&#x27;t, you get something like `<file object &quot;~/foo.txt&quot; at 0xdeadbeef>` — which doesn&#x27;t parse (on purpose) as Python.<p>I&#x27;d venture to say that what you really want is the ability to introspect. Take your customer example: if you could introspect it, and see what member variables were present, you could build a function that might output:<p><pre><code>  {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Customer&quot;, {&quot;Id&quot;: 1, &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;Joe Bob&quot;}}\n</code></pre>\nAgain, note the explicit serialization of the type here, in JSON. This is something <i>I</i> made up, of course, and not JSON. Of course, some language feature can make introspection interesting. (Can you even get a list of members? Some languages allow objects to make up members on-the-fly.)<p>Hopefully, I&#x27;ve convinced you language design is hard. :-)",1391219253

7160462,comment,7159155,7159155,2,0,kijin,,,"Type hinting for scalar types has been on and off the TODO list for PHP for a while now. PHP already has type hinting for arrays and objects, but not for scalar types like int, float, and string. It&#x27;s been on the roadmap forever but nobody seems to know when the feature will actually land in a stable release.<p>That&#x27;s because type hinting for built-in scalar types is more difficult than it sounds in a dynamic language like PHP. There&#x27;s been a lot of debate about what to do, for example, when you pass &#x27;123&#x27; (string) to a function that requires an integer, or even worse, when you pass 123 (integer) to a function that requires a float. Do you throw an error, as strongly typed languages do, or do you quietly convert that integer to the equivalent float, as PHP has always done? Or do you try to convert first and only throw an error when you can&#x27;t? Above all, how do you do this without giving up all the benefits of being a dynamic language in the first place? Note that this problem has nothing to do with the &#x27;01&#x27; == 1 issue. Things can get messy even with reasonably straightforward conversions like &#x27;123&#x27; = 123 = 123.0.<p>The problem is compounded by the fact that even built-in libraries don&#x27;t know how to make use of built-in types. For example, if you use PDO to select a row from MySQL where the &#x27;id&#x27; field is an integer, and you write something like ($row->id === 42), you get false because all the fields are returned as strings. Meanwhile, the PostgreSQL driver returns boolean values as &#x27;t&#x27; and &#x27;f&#x27; (string), not true and false (bool). This is retarded. I&#x27;m a big fan of the improvements since PHP 5.3, but both the language and the standard library still have a long way to go.",1391218838

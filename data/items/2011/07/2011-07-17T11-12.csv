Extrapolating from a selection of 60-80 words presupposes a relatively normal developmental history; otherwise one would not be able to draw the primary inference at work here, namely that somebody who knows a definition for ""mawkish"" knows definitions for all words of similar difficulty and frequency.<p>Atypical language acquisition (e.g., as a second language, or through a non-standard channel like technology or fantasy literature) disrupts this extrapolation step. For instance, a German programmer that knows the word ""polymorphic"" via OOP is less likely to know similarly frequent and difficult but programming-unrelated words than British or American peers. So adding, say, 100 to the total would be utterly unfounded. Same thing for a science-fiction nerd: Acquaintance with obscure words from one domain doesn't extrapolate to other domains.<p>Unless they somehow control for domain specificity and atypical acquisition, let's not get too frustrated.

There were a couple of words on the list that I'm sure I once knew, but couldn't conjure up the meaning on the spot, so I skipped them.  I was never a sci-fi/fantasy fan, but I do like to read literature for fun.",1310901009
2773072,comment,2772387,2772900,3,0,Someone,,,"You hit the nail on the head. There is a huge difference between knowing the general meaning of a word and being able to exactly define them. Simple examples: is a cow a deer? Why (not)?. Is a banana a berry? Is a blueberry a berry? A strawberry?<p>I used the former because I thought it was what people would do (as it is easier to do; people will not what to spend 30 or more seconds on each word), and got 26600. That is below, but about average. I am not a native speaker, but would have expected to score higher in the general population.<p>I am fairly sure that this test does not reach the general population, though (by the way, it is nice to see that the test adapts to one's level. Try answering almost none of the words on page 1. I got 'my' score down to 28 by confessing to know only one of the words)",1310900934

When I started communicating with email with people from all over the world, but mostly the US, it improved a lot in 1-2 years.
When I first went to a congress in the US in my med 20's I was blown away by my aptitude to communicate in that language.<p>But these were all people from my field. What I'm saying is that the distribution of words pertaining certain subjects in my vocabulary is severely skewed by the field I work in -- visual effects (and IT).
I believe this goes for many NNSs.",1310900888

Just because it uses a media query to serve a different style based on the screen size doesn't mean it ""scales well"".<p>In particular, this reacts quite badly to zooming, either in a desktop browser (chrome/linux): <a href=""http://imgur.com/r1z9W"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/r1z9W</a> or in a mobile browser (android): <a href=""http://imgur.com/7aP39"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/7aP39</a> .<p>In the desktop case, the font size doesn't change even if I zoom in the entire page.  This isn't the default behavior, so the author must have gone to some lengths to break this functionality.  I'm sure s/he had reasons for doing that, but I'm not sure what they were.<p>In the mobile case, zooming is constrained to a very limited range, and even when allowed, the text doesn't reflow, so it's hard to read lines because of all of the horizontal scrolling required.  This behavior is quite common for fixed width, ""grid"" layouts.<p>In general, I'm all for frameworks that solve common layout problems, but this particular framework seems to have gotten the basics wrong.  I would recommend against using it as it stands.",1310900625

The reason cholesterol in people&#x27;s diet got the blame is that there is often a strong correlation between the foods containing substances that do cause increased cholesterol in the body and foods containing significant amounts of cholesterol, and a similar correlation between certain lifestyle options that are risk factors for heart problems generally and eating those foods.<p>So blindly reducing cholesterol in your diet is not useful and may lead you into a false sense of security - you could still be taking in the other stuff and living your life in a way that will encourage the body to produce too much cholesterol itself.",1450176931

Better than others and all that.</i><p>As someone else points out in a neighbouring thread, OwnCloud is generally less secure than any of the large services, because of automated vulnerability scanning. If an OwnCloud user updates their server days or even hours to late, it can be game over and your data is on the street. It does not matter if the attacked service is OwnCloud or some other service with enough privileges.<p>This does not mean that open source and/or decentralized services are at a disadvantage, but you have to make the right security choices. The storage service[1] should never see unencrypted data - encryption at rest is not good enough. For instance, Bittorrent Sync provides this with their encrypted read-only keys. A cloud peer with such a key never sees unencrypted folder data. The only thing you lose when a cloud peer is hacked is a node in the swarm, but it&#x27;ll never result in visibility of plain-text (unless you subvert AES-128). One SyncThing developer is currently also working on similar functionality for SyncThing.<p>For this reason, I would never recommend OwnCloud to anyone outside a large company that has the capacity to do continuous security auditing and monitoring, unless you apply client-side encryption (but then you could use Dropbox et al. as well if privacy is the primary consideration).<p>[1] I know that OwnCloud does more than just storage.",1450176061

I wish my GP would do the same.<p>I recently had a really high cholesterol reading (both total cholesterol and LDL). Everything else (blood pressure, blood glucose etc) seems fine. I&#x27;m 38, fit and healthy and nothing that suspect in my family history. I found the attitude of my doctor in all this quite surprising. It amounted basically to &quot;You definitely have familial hypercholesterolemia. There is no other possible option here other than statins&quot;. No further questions about what I eat, my stress levels, lifestyle - nothing.<p>What disappoints me the most here is now that I feel like it&#x27;s all on me to determine what my real risk levels are and what&#x27;s appropriate to treat this.

There are important aspects of this that should be taken into account. First, nobody died. Second, the fault didn&#x27;t occur during combat.<p>Yes, there are some projects that waste insane amounts of funding with underwhelming results like the Army&#x27;s 5 billion UCP (Universal Camouflage Pattern) and Air Force&#x27;s F35 programs. Cases like those usually occur due to personality-driven leadership.<p>Imagine you have an officer with a lifetime of domain-specific knowledge but little/no experience with product development. Give him an objective, a line of funding, and the responsibility to draft a contract to make it happen. This is the usual case.<p>Things can go south for a few reasons. The officers in charge don&#x27;t reach out for outside feedback/advice, and default to relying solely on the advice of the contractors. Poor assumptions are made or requirements are overlooked, delaying production. The procurement process takes such a ridiculously amount of time that COTS equipment goes obsolete and/or can&#x27;t be sourced by the time it&#x27;s required for implementation.<p>To make matters worse, contracting guidelines dictate that projects follow a waterfall design model. The specification process all happens up-front. Lots of bureaucracy, lots of documentation, lots of steps where mistakes and bad assumptions can/will be made on a tight time schedule. There are exceptions to the rule but generally field testing doesn&#x27;t take place until after launch.<p>People wonder why the military spends billions of dollars training and &#x27;playing war&#x27; every year. They do it to iron out the kinks in their equipment, organization, and processes. If the services do their job (which most do very well) they will identify, report, and correct problems before they&#x27;re put to the test in a wartime environment.<p>In software development terms, prototype with a waterfall and iterate over time. The difference being, on software projects iterations happen on the scale of weeks/months. On military projects, iterations happen on a scale of years (ex 3 or 5).<p>The news will jump on any sign of weakness chanting &#x27;muh taxpayer dollars&#x27;; oldschool politicians like McCain will sponge up the public attention calling for &#x27;the good old days of big iron&#x27; (aka sitting ducks); and, none of that matters because war changes and the tools of war need to adapt to overcome those changes.<p>All I can say is, I respect the fortitude of the service members who do this type of work. It&#x27;s truly a miserable, thankless job, fraught with unbelievable obstacles and little support.<p>Source: I used to work on a contract under MARCORSYSCOM, which is basically the product development division of the US Marines.",1450173613

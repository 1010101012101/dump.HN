Looking at the performance equation I gave earlier, the second portion has gone from several 10s of cycles/instruction in the 486 timeframe to 2-3 INSTRUCTIONS/cycle for  the Pentium III.<p>My point was that your statement about 90% of the gains being from Instructions/clock (ie. architecture) was not always true. The Pentium 4 being a prime candidate, where the number of pipestages was dramatically scaled up (reducing instructions/clock) to increase frequency.<p>WRT cost/die: Cpus are created on circular silicon wafers. <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/hardware/news/2008/09/moore.ars/2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/hardware/news/2008/09/moore.ars/2</a> \nEvery move to a lower process node, reduces the area for each cpu die. For a given cpu, this means that more of them can be added to each wafer, driving down the cost for each unit.<p>Ofcourse, as you mentioned, by keeping die size a constant , they get get more transistors/die, allowing them to cram more features on a chip. Lowering costs v/s adding features is a tradeoff that every cpu design team has to make.",1268593124

1191105,story,,,2,0,Aegean,"Ask HN: How to rapidly get a product/company website built?",,"Startup founder here, busy bringing up a non-web software product.<p>How could I rapidly get a compact/editable/live website that clearly describes my product/company?<p>I envision that I need a minimal website that:<p>1) Clearly describes the product<p>2) Clearly describes the company and what it does.<p>3) Does not look mediocre. (E.g. those static html sites based on those usual narrow rectangular templates with links at the side or top).<p>To be more precise - it should show that it is a startup website, but one that seems a little established with the look & feel. It should show it is a small company, but give the impression some investment has been made on site design.<p>4) The site must be easily changeable. (i.e. updates on parts of it without much html tweaking)<p>Extra:<p>5) An easy-to-modify company blog, can upload product news/descriptions/videos. A startup is changing quick, and so should the website.<p>For this, I mistakenly invested my precious time and built this: http://tinyurl.com/y994z55<p>It works but it partially has (1) and (2) and neither of (3), (4) and (5). I learned from my mistake and built this without spending much time:<p>http://tinyurl.com/yevywv5<p>This one is better, because it partially has (1), (2), (4), and somewhat (5) (i.e. videos)<p>But It's not good enough. I have a feeling there must be a way to quickly bring up a decent site with all of the above.<p>I am not posting this for finding a consultant, simply asking for opinion. I genuinely believe it does not require complex specialized specs other than stated, its a common pattern.<p>This on its own is a startup idea I think, a company website package that doesn't suck. At least I haven't encountered any easy solutions so far.<p>From recent posts: Rethinkdb and Pivotal Labs sites are quite close examples to what I need. Weebly and google site templates aren't as they don't have (3).",1268593006

1191094,comment,1190172,1190172,0,0,tptacek,,,"Here's my take.<p>First, I want you to remind yourself: most aim-for-the-stars product startups fail. Most product startups fail. Most products fail. When you commit yourself to a product, to the exclusion of all else, you are making a bet at long odds.<p>You have another option: you can build a <i>business</i> first, and a <i>product</i> second. I'd encourage you to think of your consulting work as business-building, and not as a time sink that is cannibalizing your product. If you're doing it well, even when you're writing lines of code for someone else, you're getting other benefits:<p>* You're building a team and learning to work well together<p>* You're learning basic business skills, like <i>selling</i>, and managing cash flow<p>* You're forging relationships with other businesses which you'll leverage throughout the life of your company<p>* You're getting exposed to the problems that (in your case) small-to-medium companies have with their IT, which will be fertile ground for product offerings<p>There are three other benefits to your approach, two of them obvious, and one of them much less so:<p>* First, you own your company. Like a lot of other people here, I've done the VC thing before, and it's not an exaggeration to say that when you do it, you're buying yourself a new kind of boss. A couple years from now, you're going to be glad you did it this way.<p>* Second, you've bought yourself a lot of time to slowly turn the dials until you find a product or service that <i>works</i>. Matasano's first product idea would not have worked had we taken it to market it. Even if we had gotten funded. In fact, <i>especially</i> if we had gotten funded. We watched 4-5 companies get funded with essentially the same product, and then got to watch them all run aground over 3-4 years. The safety net is not a minor benefit of this approach. I think it's pretty huge.<p>* Third, having something other than a product to contribute to the business with can be a win. I've said this on HN before: if you're new to startups, you may have deluded yourself into thinking that you'll be redlining your productivity for years and years on end, working 80 hour weeks and committing thousands of lines of code a day. No. You won't. You will burn out. If you don't, seek psychiatric help! A benefit to having a thriving consulting business is that when you hit your doldrums, you can go be billable and know you're making a major contribution to the company.<p>A couple bits of practical advice:<p>* Get an actual office.<p>* It's hard to do a product and a service at the same time. Grow the services business and hire full-time product people (full-time product devs are cheaper than devs who can be billable).<p>* Don't lowball your rate with a customer you intend to keep. It's very hard to raise rates with customers. Companie with more than a couple hundred employees have ""procurements"" people whose entire job is to make sure rates go <i>down</i> over time. Cut scope or schedule, not rate.<p>* Stay away from race-to-the-bottom services. Look for premium services. For instance, now seems to be a great time to be an iPhone developer, or a Rails/Django developer.<p>* Think of ways to increase the lifetime value of your customers. For instance, offer retainer-style maintenance agreements to all your customers, so they can get feature requests and minor bugfixes done on a predictable schedule. Something I've learned over the last couple years: many companies will pay for predictable schedules. You don't have to give ""predictability"" away for free.<p>* Read everything 'patio11 has to say about measuring and marketing a software business. Patrick has spent something like 5 hours a week nurturing a software business alongside a <i>Japanese salaryman position</i> (there is no more ""full time"" commitment in technology on the planet, outside of those factories in China where they assemble the iPods). He's about to quit his job, because his product --- which I don't think he's be offended if I summed up as ""hello world hooked up to a random number generator"" --- is beating his full-time salary. I mean it, go to SearchYC, start at his first post, read all the way to the most recent.<p>* Use bcrypt instead of SHA1 to hash your passwords.<p>* Pick a product you can develop incrementally. Pick a product you can host, with a web interface. Pick a product you can measure task completion in. I wish I could figure out a way Matasano could do what Patrick is doing, watching the lifecycle of his prospects from first touch on the website to ""printing first bingo card"". It's hard for us, because we work in security, and our users are touchy. Don't be like us. Pick a product you can measure like the Oceanian Thinkpol.<p>My biggest piece of advice is, <i>don't</i> shut off your consulting business. If IMVU can build a successful company with chatty online dress-up dolls and the lean startup methodology, imagine how much damage you can do with something that solves real problems for people. You are not running out of time. Build a business. Don't roll the dice on a product you haven't even tested yet.",1268592497

It's <i>perfectly natural</i> for people to turn to someone they know who knows about a topic. My father-in-law has answered my questions about cars for years. If there's something he can help with, he does; otherwise he tells me where I need to take it. Maybe I sometimes ask him for help that's actually a lot of work: that's not me being importunate, that's <i>me not knowing about cars</i>. Somehow he's never had any trouble helping me when he can and explaining when he can't. And when someone asks me about computers -- which they do all the time -- I'm delighted to return the favour.

Both with formal ID firms, and as general product development (most of my startup experience is with companies that produced some sort of hardware).<p>To make the battery removable you need to make a ""pocket"" for the battery to sit in that is separated from the rest of the electronics.  You also need to make the battery pack itself thicker than it would need to be if it was just an internal device (plastic casing, etc.).  You also need to add some contacts for the battery and other odds and ends.<p>This probably adds about $3-$5 to the BOM for a device like the iPad.  This may sound small, but it is a significant number by the time you factor in the end-user price.  It also adds additional weight and design considerations, plus additional thickness to the overall product.<p>Yes, plenty of devices have removable batteries.  And in several cases (like the Droid I just got) the battery cover is a flimsy piece of crap that detracts from the products integrity.<p><i>I suppose you don't include every laptop ever made as examples of replaceable batteries in practice.</i><p>Yes, I'm quite aware that most other laptops have had replaceable batteries.  I've owned dozens of them, and hadn't needed to replace a laptop battery since about 2002.  They died of general system failures or complete obsolescence before they needed new batteries.  The vast majority of laptops with replaceable batteries have also not been designed for the portability, sleekness, and usage style that the iPad has.  Comparing the industrial design of the iPad and its battery to legacy laptops is not an apples-to-apples comparison (pun intended).<p>I really don't think that when it comes to Apple this is ""designed obsolescence"" as much as it is recognition that we've been Doing It Wrong for many years.<p>I also find it ironically humorous that you cite your electronic razor among arguments of designed obsolescence and environmental/sustainable life style arguments.  I use a Merkur Futur razor.  I replace only the single blade about once a week.  The razor handle will last forever, and it does not have replacement cartridges that are grossly over-priced items.  My razor also does not have other environmentally unfriendly items like batteries, and motors and other elements that will eventually wear out and be unreplaceable.<p>Everyone chooses a slightly different way to manage their impact on the world and product choices.<p>Regarding environmental concerns, the way I read this is that if your battery dies Apple will give you a refurbished unit with a new battery for a little more than what a replacement battery would likely cost.  It seems like this would encourage users to keep devices LONGER, if they can get a freshened up unit along with a new battery.  It's not like it has ever been stated that if the battery fails you must immediately plant your iPad in a landfill.",1268590485

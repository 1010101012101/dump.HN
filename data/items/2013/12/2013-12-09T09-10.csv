Complaining that the definitions of everyday words are unclear is just a bullshit distraction. If that were the case, we simply could not communicate at all.<p>It is indeed very hard to communicate with people like yourself who insist on seeing everything as violence and aggression, but we must try.<p>And we absolutely can (and do) disagree about definitions. Have you never heard the old socialist line &quot;all property is theft&quot;? Now if I understand you correctly, theft is a form of violence, so to some people property itself is a problem of violence and aggression.<p>>> Yes, well, now we&#x27;re in the territory of collectivist thinking, which is just completely ass-backwards considering we&#x27;re all just individuals, not part of The Borg.<p>And we all live on a shared planet and all of our actions impact on other people, you do not live on an asteroid with no other people around. Get over it.<p>>> Collectivism is one of the supporting pillars of States. We&#x27;re bombarded with the idea that we must all be subject to a ruling class for the common good, that we need to pay taxes to help poor people, and so on.<p>Nobody I know says you must be subject to a ruling class, though many do say we must be subject to a set of rules that we come up with collectively. Many of them may be covered by NAP, many are not. Otherwise I don&#x27;t disagree - taxes are generally a good thing, though we should fight inefficiency where we can. And I speak as an earner in one of the 1% highest earning households in my country.<p>>> In case you haven&#x27;t noticed, you already find yourself in Corruptopia.<p>I know, right? And just look at us! Highest standards of living in the world and highest standards of living in history! And look at those places where there&#x27;s little or no government, they collapse into tribalism, violence, warlords and total social decay! Corruptopia is pretty sweet right?<p>I&#x27;ll not deny we have problems (it&#x27;s Corruptopia after all), but not the sort that I see being solved by adherence to a bizarre, simplistic and flawed moral (non-)axiom.<p>>> The obvious answer was &quot;no&quot;, and that&#x27;s enough. We&#x27;re not talking about edge cases here, because there are countless, and wading through them is pointless. There are even more circumstances where it takes zero effort to adhere to the NAP.<p>No, the obvious answer, and the one <i>you explicitly agreed with</i> is that it depends on the circumstances. It&#x27;s almost as if there were other moral principles at work that you allow to override your NAP from time to time. How odd!<p>>> See, in reality, there is no problem with the NAP, even if no moral rule can &quot;cover&quot; every possible situation ever. That just can&#x27;t be required. As mentioned, the best we can do is &quot;close enough&quot;, and the NAP certainly is.<p>A rule that is as full of holes as that, as disputed in definition, is not a good rule to use as the basis of society.<p>>> See, in reality, there is no problem with the NAP, even if no moral rule can &quot;cover&quot; every possible situation ever.<p>If no moral rule can cover every possible situation then how about we don&#x27;t try and structure society about one rule eh?<p>>> Right, and what fucking sense does it make to physically assault someone for saying something bad about you or your girlfriend? Insecure much? Feeling violent?<p>Me, no, but you said everyone knows it&#x27;s wrong. I was giving the counterpoint that pop-culture is filled with violence and aggression, even amongst the &#x27;good guys&#x27;.<p>>> You know that the NAP works just fine.<p>I <i>know</i> that it&#x27;s not the be-all and end-all of the basis for a good society.<p>>> Who&#x27;s anyone to tell you what you should do, as long as you don&#x27;t harm others?<p>Where the line of harming others starts is entirely subjective. A lot of people deny the anthropogenic global warming/climate change is real, and so continue to wantonly fill the air with greenhouse gasses. They don&#x27;t see it as harming anyone yet scientifically speaking they are harming everyone for multiple generations.<p>It&#x27;s just not as simple as you like to think, and the results of a balanced mix of property rights and collectivism has so far resulted in the best societies the planet has ever seen.

These records are not secret by any means (the phone company owns them, not you) and its a minimally intrusive way using amounts to pattern matching to find some people who might want to hurt me and my countrymen not for who we as individuals are, but simply because we&#x27;re Americans based on their Call Detail Records history.<p>Having spent the majority of my career working in the Telecom industry, these records are accessed with surprising ease - anyone with any sort of access to the billing system usually has full access to them (Both at a Major ITSP and one of the major wireless carriers in North America) I had actually presumed the government did too - perhaps not in real time, but anytime they wanted on demand.<p>I don&#x27;t consider it a private thing whom I talked to - I consider the contents of those calls protected, but not the fact I made them. For what its worth, because of the structure of our telephone network, it virtually impossibly to monitor the contents of every call - You&#x27;d have to have a recording device or special service trunks to every end point everywhere in the nation. Billing records on the other hand, are generally forwarded to a central collection point for processing into your telephone bill (as well as storage and analysis for traffic planning purposes).<p>For what its worth - I don&#x27;t think the government has a right to access mobile telephone geolocation data without a warrant - that to me is so clearly protected as it - ought to be - to be a breach of privacy if collected without a warrant.<p>These are simply my opinions, others clearly feel differently - IMO there really is no wrong answer here, it&#x27;s all about what feels right and just to you, and where your line of privacy is.",1386580204

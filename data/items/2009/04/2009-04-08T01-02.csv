552130,comment,551356,551622,0,0,jerf,,,"Even if it is more expensive, I am inclined to think the nuclear power plant is far more friendly to the planet than solar, and if you care about carbon footprints or very-long-term sustainability, it's better than natural gas, too. (I am not too big on the former, but the latter is important. Going big on fission buys us a lot of time to develop fusion, which in the end is the only truly sustainable energy source. When you run out of fusion, you've run out of the Universe.)<p>However, I've seen tons of analyses of the costs of nuclear, and I'm inclined to think that when push comes to shove, nobody <i>really</i> knows how much they could cost if society wanted them enough to construct them in quantity. How much of the cost of a plant in the US is defending against absolutely inevitable litigation, in a process designed to be used by environmentalists against anything they don't like? How much of the cost is because we refuse to consider any actually modern design, in much the same way we get stuck on refusing to consider how to deal with waste because the problem is perceived to be so big that people's minds just irrationally shut down? How much of the expense is due to compliance with an outdated regulatory regime that hasn't been updated for the properties of pebble bed or other modern designs? Why are China and France able to put them up?<p>I don't think there's any actual engineering reason that nuclear plants should be more expensive (per watt) than natural gas or coal, even before fuel price spikes. (Which will come again... and again... and again...) A given design, certainly, but across the whole set of safe, modern nuclear designs? I doubt it. Our thinking on this topic is so deeply 1960s (OMG RADIATION!!1!) that we are all but incapable of considering the topic rationally in 2010.",1239155334

552127,comment,551756,552031,0,0,trominos,,,"> Dear children, your silly worldview of objective rights and wrongs is outdated and wrong. Morality is purely subjective, a matter of taste. I provide no evidence or reasoning for my opinions but I do expect you to be challenged and wowed by their far-reaching consequences.<p>If you think that there is some objective morality that is inherent to the universe, the burden of proof is very much on you to show that, not on me to disprove it. (But if you need a disproof, here's as close as I can get: I am 100% certain that you cannot give a definition of ""morality"" that both meshes with what's expected of the term <i>and</i> that implies the existence of some fundamental objective framework for determining what's right and what's wrong. Just think about it for a while.<p>Or, alternatively [and not equivalently, but evocatively]: we're all just particles. You can give any brilliant argument you like about the morality of an action, and my particles are just gonna keep on doing whatever the fuck they want.)<p>As you discuss, lack of objective morality is <i>horrible</i>. It still makes me feel weird when I think about it, and I decided that ""ethics"" was bullshit when I was thirteen. My brain is hard-wired to believe that certain actions are ""right"" and certain actions are ""wrong"" in a sense that encompasses more than just my brain's response to those actions, so thinking about (what I see as) the truth about morality causes a dissonance between my conscious and my subconscious.<p>In the same way, my brain believes very deeply that everything has a cause, so it believes that there's a meaningful answer to the question, ""Why does the universe exist?""<p>But that question doesn't have an answer. And objective morality doesn't exist. Sorry.",1239155278

If there was a massive content distribution network with kiosks in shopping centres where I could put in a DVD-RW or usb storage device (or pay for a blank DVD) and pay for the latest movies and TV shows I'd make a good amount of use of it.<p>It's mostly about saving bandwidth, but also trying to provide an extremely fast and convinient alternative to piracy.  If that existed, I'd probably use it.  I already buy TV shows on DVD if someone I trust recommends them highly enough - a much better experience for me than watching them on TV, no adds, pause, rewind, etc...<p>We get some shows quite a bit later here, and a few of the good shows only come to pay tv.  So the timing would be the key.  As soon as the TV show is aired anywhere - bam - available from the kiosk.  The premium for being ad free and not getting it on the studios timeline might more or less balance out with the savings in packaging and distribution.<p>Same with movies.  Theaters wouldn't be happy, but we're rapidly approaching the days when people will go to the movies for the theater experience and otherwise just get hold of it online (one way or another).<p>As a bonus idea, if the kiosks kept records of what you'd bought then buying a whole series through the kiosk gets you a big discount on the DVDs if you want the physical media since you've already paid for the IP at the point.",1239153957

It basically worked, but poorly - we never took into account that battery life would be an issue on the phone app.<p>We got a little disheartened, started bickering and eventually the thing failed - before we even launched.<p>Somehow we had gotten the idea in our head that we needed YC to be successful. No, we needed a good idea and our idea was, at the time, not so good.<p>Not being accepted isn't the worst thing in the world. Everyone thinks their idea is the best idea EVER... We sure did.<p>The partnership broke down as a result of us forging ahead anyway without really looking at our product and only talking to people who only gave us positive answers.<p>Anyway, moral of the story for us? Being rejected was the best thing that could have happened for us.<p>I learned a lot about the other person during this process and also a lot about myself. I'm not bulletproof.<p>On reflection, I also learned that being unwilling to discuss my idea openly with others for fear of it being stolen was stupid. We would have discovered flaws early on and saved us a lot of trouble.<p>I openly discuss my new idea with others now.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=502164"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=502164</a><p>Some people tell me it's stupid, I ask them why and we discuss it. Some others tell me it's interesting, and we discuss it. Some tell me it's great and we discuss it.<p>I refuse to accept simple answers now and discuss as many different aspects as I can think up. I also appreciate other's perspectives on it.<p>This has also helped cement the idea in my head and I can pitch it relatively easily now. I've come up with a solution to a problem, rather than having a solution and looking for a problem.<p>Will I apply to YC again? Probably, I'm not sure. I've got a clearer head now - not so caught up in the hype.",1239152415

9642110,comment,9639055,9639055,0,0,wolfgke,,,"I really don&#x27;t understand the hate that whiteboard coding has on HN. In Germany, this is used a lot in the programming tutorials on universities. It&#x27;s not that there isn&#x27;t a projector in about any larger seminar room. But most exercise instructor will strongly prefer whiteboard coding for explaining how to design an algorithm that solves the given exercise. The strong advantage is that you can easily draw pictures at some other corner of the whiteboard that illustrate the idea of the algorithm lines that you just wrote. This is also the preferred way for students to explain their implementation of the exercises. They could easily just show the source code on their laptop that they implemented. But I (and many other students and exercise instructors) see that the explanations are a lot more easy to follow if they have to build their implementation step by step on the whiteboard explaining their ideas thereby. On the other hand, if you have no idea how to solve the algorithm you can still write a skeleton of the algorithm and draw pictures by the sides to show where problems might occur.<p>Most exercise instructors would say that only really good students are able to directly write an algorithm down into the computer. On the other hand, any student should be able to draw, say, a flowchart, of the algorithm. If you have done that (and are confident that it looks correct), <i>then</i> you can write a code snippet next to each box of the flowchart that implements (this is only one example. There are exercise instructors that prefer other ways than flowcharts. For example when you instead use recursion, there are other, better, methods). This way you wrote down an algorithm using the flowchart as an intermediate abstraction to simplify the problem.<p>It might be that in the US a different way is used to teach programming (I really don&#x27;t know which).<p>Also in the internship whiteboards were regularly used when discussing about the best way to implement an algorithm (in about the same way they were used in the programming tutorials with the only difference that once everybody understood the idea, all got back to their computer to implement the algorithm). I never had to whiteboard code anything in job interviews, though.<p>So I really claim that I wouldn&#x27;t be really worse in whiteboard coding than if I were coding on a computer. I also have reasoned why whiteboard coding is a lot more comfortable in particular in the case when you don&#x27;t have an idea how the complete algorithm even has to look like (than things that you can be done on a whiteboard, as drawing pictures, drawing flowcharts or writing down recursion equations can badly be done directly in a source code editor). Thus the only explanation that I have for the (nearly) universal hate of whiteboard coding on HN is that many people (me too) have difficulties writing code under stress situations (say, job interview). But this also applies if you write the code on a computer. Thus I believe the hate on whiteboard coding is rather a scapegoat for a lack of programming skills. If it were replaced by another method of a systematic assessment of programming skills, they wouldn&#x27;t fare better (they just wouldn&#x27;t have the scapegoat of whiteboard coding anymore).",1433192254

However you are confusing how this is shown in court - what needs to be established - from the principle and definition of coercion.<p>Law enforcement did not charge him for the hitman so the defense did not need to put up a case for entrapment, and as far as I can tell the legal defense dropped the ball a number of places. So it is not enough to point at the defense and backwards reason that if there were entrapment that it would have been established. There was no opportunity. There will be a separate hearing on the use of law enforcement coercion and we may see an argument and evidence presented there.<p>Neither of us would be willing or able to establish a full defense of DPR or a full case for law enforcement - suggesting that this is my responsibility is intellectually dishonest.<p>Take any number of resources:<p><a href=""http://www.pdxcriminallawyers.com/articles/entrapment-and-police-coercion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pdxcriminallawyers.com/articles/entrapment-and-po...</a><p>&quot;What Is Entrapment?<p>When it comes to police coercion, a defendant is assumed to have the responsibility to turn down an opportunity to commit a crime when posed by a law enforcement officer. Instead, a defendant will need to prove that the law enforcement officer took additional actions to force a person into an illegal act. The following may be considered sufficient actions to force a person into committing a crime they otherwise wouldn’t:<p>- Fraudulent claims or promises<p>- Depending on the specifics, verbal harassment or flattery<p>- Threats against a person, their property, or their job<p>If a defendant wants to cite entrapment, they have a duty to present proof of entrapment. As it is what is known as an affirmative defense, the defendant has to offer evidence to clear their willing involvement in a crime.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.grayarea.com/entrap.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grayarea.com/entrap.htm</a><p>&quot;So, a defendant cannot be exonerated of a crime on an entrapment claim even if he or she can prove that police had no reason whatsoever to suspect even the slightest of criminal inclinations. What they must prove is that were induced by police to commit the crime. This leads us to the second of the four questions: What constitutes inducement?<p>An officer merely approaching a defendant and requesting that they commit a crime does not. To claim inducement, a defendant must prove he or she was unduly persuaded, threatened, coerced, harassed or offered pleas based on sympathy or friendship by police. A defendant must demonstrate that the government conduct created a situation in which an otherwise law-abiding citizen would commit an offense.&quot;<p>Yes, what you are arguing against is a straw man. Quite simply you are not charitably interpreting the situation whereby law enforcement created a situation in which DPR had an incentive to hire a hitman as entrapment. It is the simulation of blackmail, fraud and threats to DPR&#x27;s business that constitute coercion.<p>Merely suggesting that there be a hitman is not coercion. But simulating blackmail, defrauding him and threatening his business constitute coercion.<p>This is what we&#x27;re talking about and you have repeatedly been ignoring.<p>Because you are arguing merely in the context of &quot;they offered a hitman and he agreed&quot; you are arguing against a weakened form of my argument.<p>My argument, in full, charitable form, can be seen in the second reference quoted.<p>&quot;An officer merely approaching a defendant and requesting that they commit a crime does not. To claim inducement, a defendant must prove he or she was unduly persuaded, threatened, coerced, harassed or offered pleas based on sympathy or friendship by police. A defendant must demonstrate that the government conduct created a situation in which an otherwise law-abiding citizen would commit an offense.&quot;<p>An officer <i>did not merely</i> approach DPR and request that he commit a crime.<p>They simulated blackmail, fraud and threat to property: that is coercive.<p><i>Definitions</i> of blackmail includes the word &quot;coercion&quot;.<p>Please, I don&#x27;t care how long your posts are if you don&#x27;t bother to address the premises of the argument.<p>Because you are refusing to address the use of simulated blackmail and fraud to coerce DPR, you are not charitably engaging the argument.

Mouse movements require a feedback loop where the user must lift their hand feel around for the mouse, then move the mouse, then there is a rapid loop where the user moves the mouse, sees where the cursor goes, determines how far from the destination it is, then repeat until the goal is reached.<p>Vim cursor movements however are more logical and absolute.  Go up 2 lines, end of word, end of line, everything inside the quotes, etc.  The cognitive load required is much less in vim -- at least once learned, but definitely not in the beginning when going through the learning curve.<p>It may not seem like much but every bit of brain power that can be freed up is that much more brain power that can be used to concentrate on the task at hand.<p>To someone who is trained in vim it just feels much more relaxed and fluid when editing.  To exaggerate, imagine if every time you had to use the mouse, you had to open a drawer, pull out the mouse, plug it in, perform your action, then unplug it, then put it back into the desk.  This is a contrived example for sure but it gives an illustration of the subtle distraction and annoyance many vim users feel when they have to use the mouse.",1433190395

He published a paper [1] in regards to performance for several common Linear Algebra computations across a variety of input sizes. In particular, Figure 2 shows you where each of the platforms works best.<p>FPGAs are essentially re-programmable hardware, so they tend to outperform CPUs/GPUs when you program them for a specific task. They don&#x27;t have to deal with most of the overhead that the more generalized platforms deal with which is why they dominate in the small input sizes. However, with FPGAs you&#x27;re trading space (silicon) for that re-programmability so you can&#x27;t have as much hardware in the same area as say a GPU. Thus, when the data sizes have saturated the available hardware of the FPGA for computation, the GPU begins to outperform. Due to the decreasing node sizes (28nm, 22nm, etc), we can fit more programmable logic into the same area, which causes the chart I mentioned above to shift more into the FPGA&#x27;s favor.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sam_Skalicky/publication/256980256_Linear_Algebra_Computations_in_Heterogeneous_Systems/links/0c9605241d93d4d4d2000000.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sam_Skalicky/publication...</a>",1433190383

In the process, we learned a ton about the world of government software. Many people know about the disastrous Healthcare.gov launch, but there&#x27;s a long list of huge technical problems that impact everyone in the US. A few examples: people are dying because the Veteran&#x27;s Administration is six months behind in processing claims, the IRS system goes down for regular maintenance every night, and the Social Security Administration is still paying benefits to millions of deceased Americans because their data is so poorly managed.<p>Over the past year, our team has seen an opportunity to create software that radically improves how our government serves its people, and we&#x27;ve started our company, Nava, to chase that vision.<p>You probably remember the initial launch of Healthcare.gov, but you might not have seen our relaunch in the news. That’s a good thing. Here are a few facts we can share: our new insurance application is processing 70% of all apps coming through the marketplace, converts 35% more people than the old app, gets them through in half the time, and is mobile-friendly (20% of applications were started on mobile). App 2.0 was the first system that CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) ever hosted on Amazon AWS, and the login system we just launched saves taxpayers $70 million a year.

We used Ada&#x27;s constrained types (this value is between 1 and 99, if it goes out of range, throw an exception).<p>For external hardware inputs, we had software simulating the messages when we couldn&#x27;t get the real equipment in the lab.

They tested and tested.  An when they built the physical radar, the software worked.  A few configuration things here and there needed adjusting.<p>Actually testing was built into the software.

Look at how game developers have demanded shared memory in JavaScript, for example. Modern multicore CPUs do a lot of work to make shared memory work, and work well.<p>> Most games use worker-queues(in which case you can use non-GC objects) to deal with architectures like the CELL and for better cache coherency.<p>I agree with you that GC is often not the best solution for shared memory concurrency. But I think you really need to design the language around &quot;no GC&quot; in order to make that really ergonomic relative to C++.

Is it the PythonVM/JVM byte code? The x86 code it is JITted into?  The microcode that interprets the &quot;native&quot; x86 code? You probably mean the x86/ARM/whatever bytecode, but that&#x27;s not a trivial definition.<p>Practically speaking, compiling to &quot;native code&quot; is mostly useful given a known architecture. &quot;rep movsb&quot; used to be the fastest way to copy memory around; and then it was slow as mollasses; and then it was fast again. Table lookups were the fastest way to do 6-bit by 8-bit multiplications up until the 386 or 486 - and then the multiplier became faster than memory.<p>Somewhat surprisingly, J (and APL and K) tend to focus on promoting those things that have always been true - e.g. sequential access is much faster than non sequential; branch free code is better than branching code; small code/data that fit in cache/main memory is better than larger code/data that doesn&#x27;t. The computation model fits modern CPUs and GPUs very well, despite being approximately the same one since the 1950s.<p>It&#x27;s a different take on the &quot;better algorithms beat faster implementations&quot; - a good language that makes a good fast solution intuitive is often, in practice, better than one that can be faster with a lot of intricate work.",1433189333

Compared to most I am a decent enough programmer but when faced with a whiteboard problem or quick interview coding problem I just clam up and under perform.<p>My normal thought process is thrown out the door when I interview. Most people who know me would never guess I had social anxiety problems. Put me in a room with people I dont know and I am completely different. Add the stresses of an interview and I underperform every time.<p>I hope one day I will have an employer ask me to a quick project related to web dev.

Just the challenge.<p>Amazon does in-house R&D and is precious about the IP, like most companies. Academic research needs to have flexible IP deals.<p>Most of the Amazon funding for this event went to supporting student travel and registrations, plus gear shipping. Details are probably confidential but think roughly an order of magnitude more than the cash prize. Shipping is expensive.<p>Funding challenges is smart. Some groups are doing funded research anyway, on more-or-less related things like grasping, vision, manipulation, planning, whatever. The challenge gets teams to focus on a more complete and realistic task, thus guiding the development of their general tech in Amazon&#x27;s direction.<p>Bottom line: Amazon, the historically conservative low-margin retailer, showed up at the premier IEEE robotics research conference, brought some money and hired some grad students. Students worked hard, learned a lot. Amazon and winners got some good press. Awesome.<p>It&#x27;s interesting how the best team was way ahead of everyone else.

It&#x27;s really really really difficult to reach 100% in any real form of measurement.

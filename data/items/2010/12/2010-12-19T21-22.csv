Someone who steals a car has the same fear of being caught, and the same web of lies to friends and acquaintances to explain how they got the (stolen) goods.<p>Obviously they are not the exact same crime; there are many particulars that differ.

Fitt’s law is important but he seems to be barking up the wrong tree. Small buttons are not at all uncommon on the Mac. It’s not an iOS thing.<p>Safari’s default toolbar buttons (Back, Add Bookmark, …) have actually a smaller clickable area than Reeder’s buttons (about 800 square pixels vs. about 1300 square pixels) and if you overshoot the utterly unimportant Back button your mouse is right above the Close button. Depending on the size of the text label, Mail’s and Preview’s default toolbar buttons have about the same area as Reeder’s. OS X relic TextEdit has just as small toolbar buttons as Safari.<p>The minimum size for standard toolbar buttons on OS X is about 800 square pixels, the maximum (and default) is about 1800 square pixels. Reeder falls somewhere between those two and is certainly not some weird outlier because of that, if only because so many apps for the Mac, whether they are from Apple or other developers, have had the smallest toolbar buttons (smaller than Reeder’s default buttons) as a default for a long time.<p>I’m not saying that small buttons are a good idea, I don’t know that.

Though the dividing line between ""too slow"" and ""fast enough"" is pretty murky, it's obvious when you're firmly on one side or the other.  In the article example, 24 hours is clearly too slow, while 10 minutes is clearly fast enough.<p>Consider, too, that expert-level knowledge of the sort a DB performance person will bring is often (rightly or wrongly) more expensive than that of a generalist.  Maybe the expert can bring the runtimes down by a further factor of 100 (to 6 seconds), but, at that point, you have to seriously question whether it's worth it.   They might be able to get another factor of 100 and get the runtime for a single analysis down to 6 seconds, but at that point, you have to start seriously questioning whether it would be worthwhile to do it.  In the article's example, the analysis step could only be run twice in a week because it took 24 hours to execute (and, then, presumably the other 3 days of the week were spent doing something with the results).  Since it might take a full day and a half of work to actually do anything with the results, getting the time to run an analysis down from 10 minutes to 6 seconds clearly isn't worth it.  If it were me, I might have even stopped once I got the runtime down below an hour, because then it could be run over a lunch break or during a meeting or something.<p>I suppose my point is basically equivalent to Knuth's quip about premature optimization.  In this particular example, there seems to be no reason to optimize further, because the system is probably 95% as useful as it can possibly get.  Eliminating 47.8 hours of runtime per week lets you squeeze in one more run per week, but cutting that runtime down to 12 seconds per week (which is essentially 0) would seem to have a very small marginal gain.",1292794010

I suspect (without research) that applications which gain utility in proportion to the size of their userbase are probably helped by piracy more then they are hurt, but niche applications that perform a specialized function and have a small target audience are badly hurt by it.

2022487,comment,2022196,2022450,0,0,pbourke,,,"You almost always need to have a client object observe the state of an instance - clients need to marshall it for the network or log some information about it, etc. So getters make sense.<p>It's a problem when people assume that getters and setters must always occur in pairs. They shouldn't! Getters can expose whatever is needed to communicate the object's external identity and state. Setters are mostly a code smell. You should pass whatever you need to a constructor and use behavioural methods to mutate the internal state after construction. For instance, a Car class can have a getSpeed(), but shouldn't (in a clean design) have a setSpeed(). It should have stepOnTheGas() or increaseSpeed().<p>Getters and setters make classes into little more than verbose structs.<p>Obviously everything I've said is aimed mainly at Java-ish languages, which was the focus of the OP's comment.",1292792541

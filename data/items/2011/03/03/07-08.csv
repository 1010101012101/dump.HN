Sure, some people just don't have the skills they need. But there are a lot of situations where someone can be great at one job and terrible at another <i>depending on the fit</i>.<p>The posturing about ""the 1%"", ""A-players"" and so-forth misses the idea that you want an optimal <i>team</i>, not magic people guaranteed to give you results.<p>Of course, to build an optimal team, you need a skilled organizer. So, for example, you can take someone who's otherwise low-skill, low-motivation and give them what they need to improve.",1299139143

But I do know a few things about children, and you simply can't put a large number of them in a space together without adult supervision and expect much educating to go on. Now maybe kids would actually be better off with less learning and more playing, but again without adult supervision of the playing are going to see a lot of destructive behavior. So it's a tough nut to crack.<p>You might hope that if you managed to replace some of what teachers do with technology you could pay the childcare people less. But it's not like teachers get paid huge amounts of money today. So I'm not sure how much scope you really have for cost-cutting there.<p>My view is that education is expensive, and growing more expensive, primarily because the field hasn't seen the kind of productivity increases that the rest of the economy has. Some of that might be due to conservatism regarding technology among educators. But a lot of it is simply that kids require hands-on supervision, there is maximum ""student-to-adult"" ratio that you can't really go over, and so <i>inevitably</i> education costs are going to rise faster than other costs. It's part of the price we pay for a technologically sophisticated economy.",1299136460

How old was the mobile MP3 player industry when Apple introduced the iPod?<p>the iPad is a good device, for now. But it's not the end-all-be-all of tablets, it's just generation 1.5. In 5 years the iPad2 will look as limited and outdated as a flip-phone does today. Apple will need to continue innovating in order to maintain the advantage they have right now. They may very well do so, but it's silly to imagine that this horse race is won, it's only just started.",1299136328
2283175,comment,2282894,2283111,0,0,feverishaaron,,,"I think these companies are looking at this from a long term perspective. This and the smartphones are the only growth markets post-PC. Almost everyone will own a smartphone and/or tablet sooner than you think, and just a small portion of that market justifies the current slaughtering they will incur to gain entrance to the market and establish a beachhead. At this point it's a battle to the death for the #2 spot.<p>Apple has a massive lead by both defining the market and being almost 100% vertically integrated. Where they weren't vertically integrated, they guessed right on the opportunity factor and cut deals for components while the rest of the market was asleep.<p>Production will eventually level out, and competitive software will get better, and other tablet will eventually be able to turn 90s era PC-like margins on their products. Depending on how smart Apple plays the game (and I am betting on very smart), this may take a few years to over a decade.",1299136299

But you have your copy of the original one that they signed, don't you?<p>IANAL, but I think you should just quit.  This is not ethical behavior on their part.  If you go along with what they're asking, you're essentially abandoning your IP rights, in exchange for nothing but continued employment.  I wouldn't want to work anywhere that even asked me to do that.<p>Yes you can and should consult an attorney, but if the situation turns adversarial, you might as well quit.<p>IP-related conflicts of interest are a real problem for anyone with entrepreneurial aspirations who nonetheless needs to take a traditional employment position.  I think the best policy is to avoid working for companies whose businesses have much overlap with one's own plans (I have done this on occasion myself).<p>Yes, that probably means taking a less interesting job, possibly even making less money, while you work on your project on the side.<p>The suggestion someone made to sell your IP to a holding firm is a very interesting one, but I don't understand the implications.  That company will somehow need to defend its IP rights at some point -- at least, the way this is going, that outcome seems likely -- and I don't know how it's going to do that, unless you can get a patent filed in a couple of weeks.  Even then, to litigate a patent you need money.<p>It's more than possible I'm missing something, so maybe you should look into that option, but my initial reaction is not too optimistic.",1299136104

2283159,comment,2282094,2282094,0,0,viviensin,,,"I had this huge debate with regard to our vision of Google's future today. The question was whether Google should stay focused on developing its distinctive competence: being a superior search solution, and monetize through advertising, or whether it should branch into new ideas such as Checkout functions or even desktop products. Personally, I think it's crucial that Google to strike a balance between external acquisition and internal development for these reasons:<p>In terms of internal development, Google’s ultimate mission is to serve as a superior search function for people. So due to the saturation of the market in web search and consistency with company culture, I believe Google should leverage core tech to expand into niche search markets and strengthen additional platforms. More specifically, google should expand into niche search markets or industries where information needs to be more open and organized, for instance, the arts industry, the fashion industry, etc. In additionally, I believe small mobile devices will continue to grow in terms of user base, especially in emerging economies where more people could afford such devices. Therefore, creating applications that ties in with its platform should also be a part of Google’s platform development.<p>Externally, Google, by becoming or adopting the image of Microsoft has brought negative attention to many other high-growth companies, increasing hostility and competition from companies including Microsoft, Ebay, etc. To avoid multiple organizations joining hands to go up against the giant and hence, increasing costs like it has been in the past few years. Google needs to learn to adopt new market in a subtler manner. Instead of creating all functionalities explicitly under Google’s name, acquire small enterprises that serve similar functions and avoid too much publicity during the acquisition.<p>Item number 8 of Google's philosophy highlights the importance of going across borders. Neighboring Asian countries such as Japan (38.20% of market share), and South Korea (3% of market share) fancy locally flavored search engines such as Yahoo Japan over Google, seeing it as a form of “cultural imperialism”. In the end of the day, Google is user-based and a service product. Creating fear among users, in addition to competitors, weakens the potential growth of all other platform products it is developing. The solution to this ties in with the discrete acquisition suggestion- to create products that are culturally sensitive.<p>So instead of attempting to produce additional breakthrough products, I believe Google should keep in mind its core philosophies and focus in, with cultural sensitivity in mind,  strengthening additional platforms and expanding into niche search market.",1299135897

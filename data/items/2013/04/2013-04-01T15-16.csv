The Bada runtime and APIs are no great shakes. Much less well-developed than Qt, and no basis for a modern smartphone runtime.<p>Before iPhone, mobile OEMs were not expected to know what to do with software. The exception, at the time, was Nokia, which by itself constituted the entire first tier of the mobile handset business.<p>As for Intel, I'm sure many people on this forum have their own stories of Intel and an un-serious dabbler in OSs. The example I know of is their brief ownership of a DSP OS. Microsoft convinced them they really shouldn't be trying to define multimedia APIs and software for PCs, and that was soon over.<p>The bottom line is, there is a firm basis in history for thinking neither Samsung nor Intel, much less the two ""working together,"" such as that cooperation is, can produce a serious mobile OS product.",1364831977

So 50k is 3.7 years.</i><p>Did you read the rest of the article?<p>Quote: <i>""To make matters worse, the batteries in electric cars fade with time, just as they do in a cellphone. Nissan estimates that after five years, the less effective batteries in a typical Leaf bring the range down to 55 miles. As the MIT Technology Review cautioned last year: ""Don't Drive Your Nissan Leaf Too Much.""</i><p>Electric cars have a shorter effective range than ""the average car"" and due to charging time are less suitable for long trips (or for purchase in places where long trips are the norm) so they're likely to get driven less. And the range gets shorter as time goes on so even if they're comparable in the first year they won't be in later years.<p>Anyway, the article gave TWO data points. He said ""<i>IF</i> a typical electric car is driven 50,000 miles over its lifetime..."" gave some conclusions, and then went on to talk about a better-case scenario of the car being driven <i>90,000</i> miles. Can you at least accept these as a <i>bracket</i>? The conclusion he reached from considering these <i>two</i> hypothetical data points was that electric cars might be worse than non-electrics in terms of CO2 impact or they might be better, but were unlikely to be a vast improvement and in any case the term ""zero emissions"" is a misnomer.<p>When doing a cost-benefit analysis at the end, Lomborgh used his <i>optimistic</i> estimate - 90,000 miles - to conclude that the government would be spending $7,500 in subsidies to save $44 (in the US) or $48 (in Europe) worth of carbon.",1364831880

In fact, volatility isn't necessarily bad either if you are using it to store wealth only and you take the long view.

If governments crack down on exchange sites that allow for convertibility - that'll pretty much be it.  I'd be very surprised this hasn't happened.

Rather, they either immediately obtain the WALWriteLock, or else queue up for it. However, when the lock becomes available, no waiting backend actually immediately acquires the lock. Rather, each backend once again checks if WAL has been flushed up to the LSN that the transaction being committed needs to be flushed up to. Oftentimes, they will find that this has happened, and will be able to simply fastpath out of the function that ensures that WAL is flushed (a call to that function is required to honour transactional semantics). In fact, it is expected that only a small minority of backends (one at a time, dubbed the leader) will actually ever go through with flushing WAL. In this manner, we batch commits, resulting in a really large increase in throughput...""<p>I am sorry to cut and paste so much of the article, but I hope this is helpful?",1364831087

The universities you describe here enroll very few undergraduates and tend to have a low percentage of low income students.<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/rankings_2012/national_university_rank.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/rankings_2012...</a><p>UC Berkeley, for instance, enrolls more low income students than the entire ivy league combined.  44% of UC San Diego undergraduates qualify for Pell grants.<p>I knew people at UCSD who were trying to major in computer science while working 20+ hours a week at Nordstrom or the Tie Rack at the local mall to pay the rent.  There was some financial aid available, but not enough to cover the gap.  There are plenty of rich kids at UCSD as well, but there's a big mix.<p>I understand that when two high seniors in a wealthy school district bump into each other in the hallway and get out their measuring tapes -er- acceptance letters, UCSD isn't considered especially elite.  But if we lose a computer science student who got into UCSD because he couldn't keep up with the need to survive financially while passing compilers, vector calculus, physics, and a GE elective, we have lost an elite student.<p>I'm glad I saw this up close and understood the problems it causes.  I actually think that it may be a problem at Ivy League schools that students are so far removed from this problem - they meet fewer low income students, and those they do meet are well funded.  Do they meet the student who is struggling with the financial aid application because her father is claiming her as a dependent but isn't actually giving her any financial support?  I know two young women in this spot, one who gave up on pre-med at least in part because of tough financial problems.<p>Going to college with a large number of low income students at a school that is not quite as capable of funding them as an Ivy League opened my eyes to a lot.  In particular, I'm galled by the claims of large silicon valley companies that there is an engineer shortage.  I'm all for skilled immigration, but how does it strike you that a government and corporate elite bleating about a skills shortage is willing to watch a talented young student get bounced from a compacted CS department while working 30 hours a week at nordstrom?  All while state funding is dramatically reduced?",1364830827

Although I don't really use it anymore, my calculator (an HP scientific calculator) also uses reverse polish notation, so you can keep intermediate values on the stack, and do complex calculations without using parentheses at all.

But some of the disagreements are over what the goal should be.<p>The ""invisible interface"" people's goal (in strong form) is to dispense with explicit interfaces as much as possible, seeing them as just friction between what people want and what the computer can do. One version of how to achieve that vision is AI-heavy, relying on people saying what they want in natural language and software like Siri figuring out how to give it to them.<p>The rough opposite is more of an interface-centric approach, where the goal is to actually foreground the interface as an explicit point of interaction, and have it present a logical and coherent set of controls that, rather than being invisible, makes clear ""I am an interface and I do X/Y/Z"".<p>Detailed information about things such as eye tracking speed seems to me like it'd be most useful in doing the actual implementation, once you have a rough idea of its purpose and use case. It's certainly possible to do scientific investigation of the more general question as well, but it requires more than micro-scale laboratory tests.",1364829899

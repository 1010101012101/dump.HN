Using this library, there is a syntactic consistency between declaring types and singletons that you don't have normally.<p>I use prototype on a day to day basis and I'm not a huge fan. Mootools has captured my attention as being a better alternative, and some of the code was taken from mootools. This is just classes though, not a full JS library.",1231750597

If so, LJDAMs are not ""fire & forget"" kind of bombs, which is OK, since the IAF owns the sky over Gaza anyways.<p>Since the IAF wants to minimize the collateral damage (at least that's what they say), then LJDAMs would indeed make sense.

After some in-depth discussions, we decided to focus on what we're good at, ie algorithm design and tweaks, and partner up with others to sell it.  So we built it into a paid web service called Purifyr:  http://www.purifyr.com/<p>Please give it a try and let me know what do you think of it.<p>Here are some usage scenarios:<p>- Semantic analysis processing: The value of semantic analysis is the ability to 'understand' a web page. Purifyr could help to remove 'noise' contents to make the analysis work much faster and easier.<p>- Printer friendly web: Never waste paper and inks! By using purifyr to clean up the web pages first, you could print only what your users want. Even better, you could apply customized stylesheets to keep all print-outs in a consistent look-and-feel.<p>- Mobile ready content: Mostly of today's web pages are for desktop monitors, not mobile devices. Using Purifyr to extract the content, you'd make any urls readable on mobile devices.<p>Thanks,\nAlex",1231749108

I think once Amazon got enough volume it could begin offering high CPU and high RAM instances without diminishing overall utilization efficiency.<p>But Amazon still charges quite a premium for high RAM.. probably b/c due to IO rate limits low RAM also results in less CPU burn for many workloads than would exist if there were plenty of memory available.",1231748535

430278,comment,429948,430221,0,0,kajecounterhack,,,"Quote: <i>Government debt is typically paid back at some point. What makes you think it won't be this time?</i><p>Answer: <i>As of November 19, 2008, the total U.S. federal debt was $10.6 trillion.[2], with about $37,316 per capita (that is, per U.S. resident). The October 3rd, 2008 bailout bill (H.R.1424), section 122, raised the U.S. debt ceiling from $10 trillion to $11.3 trillion. Of this amount, debt held by the public was roughly $6.3 trillion.[3] In 2007, the public debt was 36.8 percent of GDP [4], with a total debt of 65.5 percent of GDP.[5] The CIA ranked the total percentage as 27th in the world.[6]</i><p>36.8% of our GDP. Okay. How are we paying that off if every year the deficit only <i>grows</i>?<p>In addition, you said depressions are bad but they happen. And yes they're market failures and natural periods of economic purge.<p>But bailouts are different - they basically stop that market failure that should have happened to happen. A bailout is a subsidy. Then companies that shouldn't be able to compete continue to do so, and that leaves room for more problems in the future.",1231747609

430276,comment,429477,429477,0,0,nrao123,,,"I have not read all the comments since there are too many of them. Here is my wish list(I am an ex- Mgmt consultant) without knowing if its already covered in the comments:\n1) Creating a new tab/sheet and choosing if the tab should be a document or spreadsheet type so that I can run my numbers once and reference my table in the document and not worry about cutting and pasting. Really helps reduce word document and report writing. This is a fundamential mind set shift as an excel spreadsheet hardly goes on its own. Its always accompanied by a document and syncing the numbers between the report/tables and the excel is a massive PITA.\n2) Importing some functionality of Access (running unique/group by queries, inner join/outer join etc...) in Excel. Helps me run complex data queries while maintaining data integrity.\n3) A wiki like online spreadsheet. (dont think Google Docs does this. For e.g. if we are running a valuation for a company and each team mate has different assumptions for each variables, this can help team mates input thier assumptions and track it and see the overall impact on the numbers. Instead of the current model of emailing spreadsheets back and forth or erasing new data over old ones (e.g. like Google Spreadsheets). Btw- I strongly believe just implementing this last point alone and narrowly defining yourself as a model builder (with wiki like enterprise capabilites) would generate strong traction in I-Banks, Buy side firms, sell side research firms, market research companies, mgmt consulting firms, insurance companies etc...<p>Would love to try out a beta version if available. my email is raonikhilesh ""@"" gmail",1231747353

However, another alternative pronunciation uses a hard ""G"", /ˈɡɪf/, as in ""graphics"", reflecting the expanded acronym. Both pronunciations are given as correct by the Oxford English Dictionary[2] and the American Heritage Dictionary.[3]
According to Steve Wilhite, the creator of the GIF format, the original pronunciation deliberately echoes the American peanut butter brand, Jif, and the employees of CompuServe would often say ""Choosy developers choose GIF"", spoofing this brand's television commercials.[4] This pronunciation was also identified by CompuServe in their documentation of a graphics display program called CompuShow.[4]""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format</a><p>I didn't mean to make a mountain out of a small off-hand remark, but I thought it was interesting point.

1687770,comment,1687547,1687547,0,0,tptacek,,,"<i>I wrote a comment about this a year and a half ago, and I'm just go to re-paste it verbatim here:</i><p>You want sick? Here's sick.<p>An AES block is 16 bytes long. You want to encrypt the lyrics to ""Yellow Submarine"". You can't just repeat AES for each 16 byte block, because then you can tell where the words ""yellow submarine"" --- 1 AES block --- occur: they'll encrypt to the same block. So you use CBC mode, XOR'ing each plaintext block to the previous ciphertext block, creating a unique ciphertext every time you encrypt those lyrics. But ""Yellow Submarine"" is 902 characters long; the last block is 6 bytes short. So you pad the message which a count of the pad characters --- 06h 06h 06h 06h 06h 06h.<p>With me so far?<p>Decrypt the message. Check the padding: it should repeat as many times as the value of the last byte. If not, you decrypted badly. Send an error to that effect.<p>Hey guess what! I can decrypt parts of your message!<p>If I stick a random AES block in your message, it will scramble the padded block. Every once in awhile, that scrambled message will end in 01h. 01h is valid padding. The message will be gibberish, but you at least won't tell me it had bad padding.<p>You wouldn't tell me if you decrypted to bad padding if I generated 02h 02h either. But that's much less likely than 01h.<p>Now I know that your plaintext XOR my random block produces a last byte of 01h. Solve.<p>Now my point: this is actually way old news --- back to Bleichenbacher and Vaudenay and probably before that (I'm not the resident expert) --- but attacks like this have broken peer-reviewed versions of TLS, the most peer-reviewed crypto protocol ever designed.<p>Don't build crypto.<p><i>Some quick back-story</i><p>Vaudenay described this attack almost 10 years ago, in this paper:<p><a href=""http://lasecwww.epfl.ch/php_code/publications/search.php?ref=Vau02a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lasecwww.epfl.ch/php_code/publications/search.php?ref...</a><p>It's very readable for a crypto paper.<p>We blogged about padding oracles in our AES post 2 years ago.<p>Then Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo independently re-discovered them and went on a tear looking for software vulnerable to the flaw. Just a few months ago, they busted up Java Server Faces with the exact same vulnerability.<p>The nature of the attack is this: in almost all modern web frameworks, session storage can be stored ""clientside"" in fat cookies. These cookies are encrypted so that users can't modify their contents. Because of this vulnerability, attackers can take legitimate fat cookies, decrypt them, and (often) modify their contents. Those attackers can then (say) issue fraudulent payments, change their user ID, alter their account balance, or inject SQL or Javascript into code that never expected to be exposed to attack because it was guarded with AES.<p>This vulnerability is also a galactic pain in the ass to address:<p>* It exploits the common-case error handling behavior of most web stacks (generate exception, do something that visibly indicates to the user that an exception was generated)<p>* It's not enough just to stifle the errors; you have to make observable behavior in the bad-padding case identical to the good-padding case.<p>* If you're MAC'ing packets as well as encrypting them, you also have to make sure the timing is the same in the bad-padding and good-padding case, which means you have to ""pretend"" to MAC the bad-padding packets, which is extremely counterintuitive (you have to catch an exception then pass ""something"" to a MAC verification routine).<p><i>Some food for thought</i><p>It's 2010, vulnerability research is no longer a cottage industry (it's hundreds of millions annually), and we're <i>just now hearing</i> about exploits of one of the simplest crypto flaws there is (there is almost no math to this one).<p>Software security people simply don't read crypto papers.<p>Crypto researchers, at least until recently, don't break software.<p>God only knows how much other scary stuff is buried in those papers waiting for an enterprising bug hunter to try them out.",1284404205

It seems it could be recast in Ruby for example or one of the latest functional languages.</i><p>I agree if we're talking about defining a new R (like the blog post discusses), but the existing R makes sense to me to exist as its own language. It wasn't really invented from scratch gratuitously, but began as an open-source reimplementation of the Bell Labs ""S"" language, which had already become close to a de-facto standard in the statistics community. After 30 years of writing S and R code, I think there's going to be a big uphill effort if you want to convince statisticians to read and write Ruby code instead. You'd also lose the ability to run snippets of code from the thousands of existing papers that include R/S code in an appendix.<p>One in-between possibility could be to retain the standard syntax/semantics but target an existing VM with a bigger development community. Ihaka seems to think that's impossible (he briefly discusses attempts to compile R as futile), but lots of weird and highly dynamic languages now have more efficient implementations than most people would've thought possible 10 years ago.",1284404058

If I weren't so anchored here, I'd probably look around.  That said, I like it <i>a lot</i> more than the OP here...<p>* I think the food options in SF are actually pretty excellent.  I'm going to agree that ""late dinner"" options are limited - I guess I just see that as a relevant but not defining criteria.  Options at the low and medium price range tend to fall at various ethnic eateries or small, neighborhood restaurants, and the remarkable diversity of SF does make for a lot of good options (see below).  The 15-20 seat restaurant where dinner for two + wine ranges from $80-120 is probably where SF excels the most.<p>* Astounding diversity.  I read a while back a list of cities with languages spoken by 1000 or more households.  SF actually came in first, with 6.   This shows in the number of different ways you can eat for under $7.<p>* It's truly beautiful in many ways.  There's no way to list all the views, but here are a few of my favorites: twin peaks, coit tower, the library at UCSF, the legion of honor museum (the golden gate bridge and marin headlands), the tower at the de young (outer sunset, golden gate park to ocean beach)... well, this is where SF gets an A+.<p>* On a smaller level, SF is both beautiful and horrible.  I avoid the really touristy spots (including, sadly, north beach, though I do like it in small doses).  I like walking the neighborhoods: cole valley, fillmore, hayes valley, chestnut, cortland, noe... even if some of them are a bit yuppy and others are a little blighted.  That said, the OP is absolutely correct that once you move your gaze from the beautiful views and (at times overly quaint) neighborhoods, the city is blighted and filthy in many ways, and the local populace seems far less willing than NY or Chicago to do something about it.<p>* Local outdoors: crissy fields, golden gate park, land's end, the presidio... and if you want a short drive, you can be in the middle of a quiet redwood forest in about half an hour.  The Olympic peninsula is, ultimately, a more impressive sight than Point Reyes, but I do think you can pass through more different ecosystems in Sonoma County (thick forests, sand dune beaches, marshes, etc...)  In Golden Gate park, the blight is unfortunately part of the experience as well.  Recently, a couple of pit bulls ran wild and bit a few people before the police shot them.  Maybe some day, if the city does turn this around, this will be a story we tell about our low points (like the stories you hear about Central Park in the 70s).  Maybe dirty harry can come out of retirement, heh.<p>* Do you surf? (or other ocean sports).  It's cold, but the quality to crowd ratio remains pretty good.<p>* Public transportation - not great, I don't think it's quite as bad as the OP states.  If it goes where you're going, it's ok.  BART and Muni are reasonably fast and direct provided you are underground.  Express buses are also pretty quick and good.  But if you aren't on a direct like, yeah, you're hosed.  Add in the fact that SF is (I believe) the most densely populated city west of the mississippi, and you <i>have</i> to drive and park... u, talk about the worst of both worlds. If there's one thing that makes me wish I didn't live here, this is it.  I set my life up so that I <i>am</i> one one of those direct bart/muni lines.<p>* Rockin' baseball park.  One of the best.  I don't miss candlestick at all.  Actually, the embarcadero has emerged as a pretty fun stroll from the ferry building to the ballpark (it was just a big freeway when I was a kid).<p>* Neat other stuff: San Francisco is preservation minded to a fault, and this has at times hurt the city.  But still, we do run those cable cars, and while they are overpriced, they're neat.  More amusingly, SF has restored it's own old (1930s) trolly cars, and, having run out of old cute stuff to restore, went around the world to find other cities' old trolly cars and got them running too (1890s - 1940s).  Want to see what street cars used to look like in London, Tokyo, or Milan?  Come on out to SF, we'll restore your old junk for you.  And unlike the cable cars, we don't charge tourist prices to ride them, it's just like any other bus or train.<p>* UCSF's mission bay campus is going to make a serious impact on this world.  Any time someone tells you SF is <i>only</i> preservation minded, ask them if innovation comes in the form of skyscrapers or cutting edge biotech research.  Ok, the answer is both, but don't mistake SF's hostility (which I admit is excessive) to changing the physical environment with a parochial backwoodsyness.  This is probably the most common accusation, and it's at least 60% untrue.<p>I actually tried to leave SF.  I missed my family, but it was more than that.  But what can I say, I guess I just have to stay here.  As a final note, there isn't much local snobbery in SF, other than a few bozos who like to start sentences with ""as a 3rd generation san franciscan"" (as if this somehow increases the relevance of their opinion?)  San Franciscans like newcomers.  However, they will want you to stay, especially if you have kids, and they can get peevish if you plan to leave ;)",1284402075

Almost every one of your bullet points can be explained by the phrase, ""Liberalism gone nuclear.""<p>[Expensive] -> Rent control and Private property restrictions.  Housing supply is limited w/ endless permits and restrictions on building additions or subdividing space.  And rent controls not only create artificial scarcity by not allowing price to rise w/ demand, but they also encourage people to stay in large places long after they need them.  Imagine what the web would look like if you had to wait for months for a zoning board to approve your server expansion.<p>[Casual Food] -> Wait staff must be given minimum wage and health insurance whereas the wait staff in most other cities live off tips.  What happens is restaurants become EXTREMELY expensive to run and they usually fire the wait staff at lower end places.  You'll notice the order at register and take a number tag game played a lot to get around it.  I know a few high end chefs who had to move their restaurants to Oakland b/c their waiters made more than them.<p>[Music] -> Don't have anything for you on this one.<p>[Cabs] -> Government set prices are too low.  Demand exceeds supply at that price and there is an artificial shortage.<p>[Parking] -> Tickets are one of the most reliable ways to pay for all the hair-brained social experiments that take place here.<p>[Small] -> Fixed housing supply.  See rent control / private property restrictions.<p>[Commute] -> I don't have an easy explanation.<p>[Filthy] -> Amen.  We don't have a homeless problem we have a zombie problem.  Your run of the mill drug addict is seen as a victim rather than a scourge.  He is given food, money and shelter by the government to continue his habit.  My friend worked for a non-profit in the Tenderloin that offered shelter, clothes, showers, haircuts and job help to anyone indefinitely as long as they submitted to drug tests.  Their beds in 3 buildings were always empty and they shut down.<p>[Public Transpo] -> Make a bus driver too expensive by catering too much to the unions and busses have to get bigger.  It's the opposite effect of the long tail.  Instead of many small vans and more custom routes, you have few huge routes that serve nobody very well.  Also the homeless ride the bus for free.<p>[Haight] -> In the late 60's the Grateful Dead and their followers began to get sketched out living there. Heroin and crime have been the norm there for years.  It's foul and there is no police presence.<p>All of these policies had very good intentions.

Cost meaning your effort to write the code, debug it, test it, maintain it, document it, cost for others to understand it later?<p>For what it's worth, I am getting very good mileage out of Clojure's STM.

Get stuck with one or two really bad ones, and you'll really wish you'd stuck to hourly, even if the good flat-quote projects can be the most profitable.<p>There are just so many more things that can go wrong.  The biggest one is shifting or unclear specs - you may <i>think</i> that a spec was clear enough, but when the client comes back to you 90% of the way through the project and complains that <i>obviously</i> there should have been an admin panel included in that quote, what use is it without an admin panel, certainly that was implicit, and <i>we're not going to pay you unless you put this extra feature in</i>, you've now got two options: suck it up and do it, or start a fight with the client.  Both suck, and even when you're completely in the right contractually, to push that point causes friction, and a headache for you.  Don't expect any future work, or recommendations, if you have to go that route.<p>More than that, working hourly changes the way you feel about interacting with clients - whereas under a fixed quote, every interaction is one more opportunity for the client to pile more work on, or to reject work that you've done, or to otherwise make your life more difficult in some way without increasing your compensation (at least without a bit of renegotiation), when you're hourly you're happy to interact with the client; if they pile on more work, they're aware that it's going to take more time, and that they're going to pay you more money.  Each interaction becomes a potential increase in the amount of money you're billing instead of a potential increase in the amount of time you spend to earn the same amount.  When you're on a fixed quote project, it's an extremely rare interaction that lessens the amount of work you need to do; generally speaking, the more you talk to the client, the more you end up doing for them.<p>Further, you can cut off billing problems earlier on long term projects by billing them regularly for time spent; this makes problem customers expose themselves much earlier, and you'll never be left at the end of a long project trying to collect half a year's salary from a company that's giving you the runaround.<p>There are a few exceptions where it makes much more sense to bill by the project, but those you should know when you see them (i.e. if you can do the project in a fraction of the time that most other people could, the acceptance criteria are very strict and absolutely cannot shift or be argued about, you really trust the client, owe them a favor, etc.).<p>The rest of the time, you'll experience a lot less pain billing for your time instead of for the product...",1284401366

I'm not happy that I have to fulfill an impossible requirement or have my app disabled, and more so that that requirement isn't applied to Twitter themselves or to the other large players they have partnerships with.",1284401069

I imagine most successful gyms have a relatively high number of non active members, and if use increased then membership could actually decrease because of crowding issues. I would think the gym's motivation is to increase the number of memberships while keeping actual use low, restricting this kind of investment to expensive specialty gyms. But this idea is successful only if many gyms with many active members are involved.<p>I'm sure this kind of thing will eventually happen, just doesn't seem like the economic motivation is there.

You wish to change bit 5, but you can&#x27;t change anything else because it would cause unwanted side effects.

There are analogous macros for clearing and toggling bits.<p>Or you might want to perform an operation based on a particular bit in a byte, e.g. byte 5 is a status flag that tells you when a timer has overflowed.<p>#define getbit(BYTE, BIT) !!(BYTE & ~(1 << BIT))<p>Then you can say:<p>if( getbit(myregister, 5)){\n // do something\n}<p>Fun fun :)",1389391074

It requires a lot of simultaneous attention to wide variety of details - the cost of missing something is somebody&#x27;s pain, injury, life... I can focus really deep on one thing at a time - suited me well in Math before and in programming now - while any situation requiring attention to a several different details in parallel or quick sequence just exhausts me.<p>Related to it is the perfection level required. Take the simplest thing - inserting needle into a vein. Doing it a 1000 times, you need to do it perfectly a 1000 times. In my mentality - it is much more efficient/faster to do something not perfectly, thus getting it right, say, 9 times out of 10 and apply additional effort to correct the 1 out of 10 mistake.

If you would like to see a future in which all Americans go to college, then the cost should be spread across everyone.  If you don&#x27;t, then, I think we have different views of what the future could be.  We should go back to free tuition, at least for state colleges, because an education requires so much more material than it did a century ago that stopping at K-12 was shortsighted/irresponsible, and now other countries are eating our lunch.  An analogy is the private prison system: when we began outsourcing incarceration we created an incentive for prison industry lobbyists to interfere with the criminal justice system.  Show me a private school that costs less than a public one.<p>Student motivation is a red herring.  I&#x27;ve met just as many slackers who didn&#x27;t go to college.

7039697,comment,7039043,7039221,29,0,xanados,,,"> The second paragraph amounts to a sexist version of &quot;I&#x27;m not racist! I have black friends!&quot;<p>It bothers me unduly much that it has become a common meme that saying this amounts to saying &quot;I am a racist!&quot; That may be convenient pattern-matching, but if someone has friends that are black, that is definitely <i>some</i> evidence that they aren&#x27;t racists.<p>I think this really comes down to pattern-matching and goalpost shifting. There are many definitions of racism, and conflating them serves the purposes of people on both sides of the argument, which makes it an anti-useful rather than merely useless term. When someone says &quot;I&#x27;m not a racist, I have black friends&quot; they are referring to the casual/common definition of racism, which is that they judge individuals as individuals and not based on their membership of a racial group. Under this definition, calling someone a racist is essentially saying that they have views that are sympathetic to the views of extremist groups like the KKK. Under this definition, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not racist, I have black friends&quot; makes perfect sense, because it implies that, even if they have tiny biases against people based on race, they are <i>at least</i> not so strong as to preclude having close personal relationships with them.<p>Another definition of racism, used by people arguing against them, amounts to &quot;everyone is racist in some ways, so it&#x27;s basically always wrong to say you aren&#x27;t a racist.&quot; (Obviously this is a caricature of another end of the spectrum, there are intermediate definitions) Under this definition, you can have black friends, a black husband/wife, black adoptive parents, black children, and saying any of those things simply pattern-matches to a denial of the obvious conclusion that if you aren&#x27;t black, you can&#x27;t know black struggles and so are inherently racist no matter what. If this is the definition of racism you are using, there is literally no evidence you can provide other than to <i>be black yourself</i> to avoid claims of racism against black people. People who subscribe to this definition have had arguments with people who they believe to be self-evidently racist, yet who used &quot;I have black friends,&quot; so many times, that it pattern-matches in their brain to &quot;this person is a racist.&quot; This is an uncharitable view.<p>Having black friends or black family members is Bayesian evidence that someone isn&#x27;t racist as it is defined in casual discourse, and I think it&#x27;s time that people stop pretending it&#x27;s the opposite. Similarly, having a female co-founder is valid evidence that you view females as having the capability of equal business acumen to men, no matter how much people dislike the way the argument pattern-matches.<p>Unfortunately, there is literally no way to be so careful with your language use to avoid this argument, because the issue has long, long since diverged from the norms of reasonable discourse. There will always be people on the side of &quot;everyone is racist&quot; who will just say, &quot;He&#x27;s just hiding his racist views by trying to use alternate terminology.&quot;",1389390338

In my opinion, the single biggest reason for this mess in America is the whole &quot;student loan&quot; scam. Let me explain. Colleges don&#x27;t really care about what their actual cost is because whatever they bill, they get paid by the govt. (aka student loans) for the most part. Yes, the students have no choice but to get those loans and get enrolled. Imagine if the easy supply of these loans was stopped AND the colleges were actually demanded to justify their tuition costs, I bet the student enrollment will not go down while the costs will go down significantly.<p>Imagine this. Lets say a good private college costs $40,000/yr (making up but pretty close) on paper. The actual amount that a student pays out of pocket is wayyyyy less say $10,000. The rest is covered by student loans/grants etc. So the student still ends up with a huge debt of $40,000 while the college makes a profit from the govt.

This seems, at least in my personal experience, to be a bit of red herring.<p>I&#x27;ve spent time around a couple of research universities (the kind where the degrees <i>do</i> pay for themselves), and I&#x27;ve known a lot people who pursued PhDs, post-docs and faculty positions. Most of these people are extremely bright and incredibly hard-working, and many of them were paid less than than third of what a typical programmer makes. Why did they put up with it? Because they loved their subject, and they convinced themselves they had a shot at tenure.<p>But tenure is <i>incredibly</i> hard to obtain at an elite university. You&#x27;ve got to sacrifice your 20s and much of your 30s in a haze of work, and the odds are still very slim that you&#x27;ll win the tenure lottery. And if you do win it, well, you&#x27;ve just spent the last 15 years proving you&#x27;re a workaholic who <i>can&#x27;t</i> stop. And if you do manage to slack off? I know at least one professor who was told, &quot;Absolutely, you&#x27;re a professor for life, no question. But your salary is paid for by the research you bring in. If you can&#x27;t bring in the grants, we can&#x27;t afford to pay you. At least not much.&quot;<p>So for every piece of tenured deadwood, there are probably at least 4 crazed workaholics (and in my personal experience, far more). And beyond that, there&#x27;s 50 or 100 grad students, postdocs and young faculty all working for ridiculously low wages in hopes of getting tenure.<p>So let&#x27;s do a little thought experiment: What happens if we do what this writer from the American Enterprise Institute wants, and get rid of tenure? Well, to make an analogy, how would the behavior of startup founders change if they no longer had a tiny chance of a big payout someday?<p>I do not know why US education keeps getting more expensive. But tenure, ironically, seems to be one of the things holding down salaries at elite universities, in the same way that big chunks of equity hold down startup wages. Unless somebody can provide actual <i>numbers</i> demonstrating that tenure is a problem, I&#x27;m inclined to look elsewhere.",1389389111

In fact, I hate the fact that, despite being more progressive than most VCs (and willing to discuss these issues rather than equivocating) he&#x27;s become a lightning rod. What <i>The Information</i> did to PG was almost criminal.<p><i>The people who caricature us as being only interested in funding young hotshots forget that when we started, in 2005, young founders were not a privileged group but a marginalized one. VCs didn&#x27;t want to fund them, and when they did they often as not tried to replace them with &quot;adult supervision.&quot; The fact that young founders seem a privileged group now is partly due to our efforts.</i><p>That&#x27;s half-true, but I&#x27;d debate that point. From 1995 to 2005, VCs still liked to fund young founders-- but specifically because they were so clueless. They took advantage, worked them to the extreme, diluted their equity severely, and then often handed their companies off to their (usually middle-aged) friends. After 2005, the chickenhawking dynamic (see: <a href""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/12/14/vc-istan-6-the-isms-of-venture-funded-technology"" rel""nofollo"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/12/14/vc-istan-6-th...</a>) has evolved and the new one is much kinder to young founders. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s related to YC. But YC definitely gave young founders an edge that they didn&#x27;t have before; now they have a backer who knows, through having seen so many companies evolve, how to avoid being scammed in the ways that young founders in the &#x27;90s were.<p>It seems like YC&#x27;s actual effect has been to replace a chickenhawking culture that was attracted to, but screwed, young founders with a chickenhawking culture that gives young founders a better chance of coming out on top. That&#x27;s an improvement, objectively, but it also makes YC appear to own the transformed chickenhawking culture.

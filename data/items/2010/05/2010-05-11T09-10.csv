There were even services built around it back a while ago... the names elude me but they offered 10 or 20 new followers per day based on keyword.  It was a good way to add relevant people as you used it.<p>FYI: twitter did fix this problem somewhat.  After 2000 following you need to have a ratio within 10%.  So following 2001 (or was it 2002) requires 1800 followers.  This strategy only works for the first 2000.  Presumably, he's got to clean up quite a few times before breaking past this, an easier solution would be drop it down to 1000 or even 500, something no normal person would add in a day (but even I have found cases where I add more than this in a day legitimately - within a small niche I do business, to add everyone relevant it's around 700-900 I think).<p>Finally, how do you find the traffic quality?  From what I've seen it's crap.  I've pushed ~1 million clicks in the last 2 months or so and it's pretty worthless in my experience.  I think are a lot of bots and stat services just hitting it, definitely not real traffic.",1273571999

(which, sadly, is an all too common implementation pattern), you can have:<p><pre><code>   var c = new X(foo: 3, bar: ""blue"", baz: false, quux: true, wibble: 1);

Hixie claims he will add a codec back, once one is found suitable, which means both royalty-free and implemented by the big players.<p>You appear to have done it by accident, but you'll find comments elsewhere in the thread that make the argument that he has no right to specify any codec in HTML5, whether Theora or a future royalty-free codec, and make the parallel to the img tag not specifying an image format.

1337371,comment,1336061,1336061,0,0,kaptain,,,"• This is most likely related to viewing Dropbox as a source of information sharing that cannot be controlled. It is a testament to Dropbox's influence, that the government would see DB as a threat. Until DB can promise the government a sufficient amount of control over the content shared, they won't be allowed to be accessed here. (See Google)<p>• Up until this point, the whole Google fiasco has been settled quite well.<p>1. Google didn't want to remain in China and be forced to censor content. Check. 
2. China didn't want to make an exception. Check. 
3. Google still has a presence in China and doesn't have to filter its content. China hasn't lost face and been forced to make an exception. Check.<p>Even though it's not ideal and the service gets blocked sometimes, I sense that China and Google came to an agreement together that Google's move to Hong Kong would be the most appropriate thing to accomplish the two seemingly contradictory goals. You will note that if China didn't want Google at all, they would've blocked Google in HK from day one. That's not to say that Google will never be blocked, but at this point it's safe to say that the government does not see Google as a big enough threat to warrant being blocked.<p>• Could  DB do something similar? Maybe. It seems that DB would have to reach out to the Chinese government and cooperate to some degree in a sign to show that there is a desire to be in China. Then, like Google, they could choose to pull out to HK, where hopefully there would continue to be this unspoken agreement to let foreign companies be. This might backfire in that the government might just pull the plug on all foreign companies in HK, feeling that the initial overtures were superficial and that there was just a desire to be given a certain level of access in China without having to abide by the other stipulations that other companies have. If DB chose to try and cooperate with the government, this would lead to some form of censorship (either by DB, the government, or by the users themselves) thus defeating some of the benefit of using DB. DB is fundamentally different from the service that Google offers, though, so following Google's path might not work.<p>• This whole thing makes me sad. Chinese culture is fundamentally different from Western culture. That doesn't justify certain things but you'll have to talk to people (real people…not just read chinaSMACK) to understand better some of the reasons for these policies. The point is, though, that the Chinese government is dealing with a different set of problems with a different set of values than other Western governments. Until there are some changes in the problems or in the values, we'll continue to see different permutations of these kinds of  policies. I've also seen a pattern of non-risk taking behavior here. Policies like these discourage people take chances at producing great ideas. Most Chinese comp sci students want to get a good job at a stable company. From what I have seen, and I'm still learning a lot about tech here, the lack of the entrepreneurial spirit is related to a lack in the quality of programming. There isn't the same kind of cut-throat competition that I've seen in the States and this leads to less motivation for learning the best (or better) way to do things. There are obvious exceptions to this, but in general, the motivation for someone to set up their own business is very low. It's too risky.",1273571426

Please let me know if I misrepresented him. And, I disagree that not having it in the spec is the equivalent of having it in the spec. The problem is that the spec is useless when, as Hixie puts it, it becomes fiction. Mandating either Theora <i>or</i> H.264 in the spec would have been useless because either Firefox/Opera would be violating the spec or Safari/IE would be. So the only option left to them was to leave it out of the spec, something that Hixie was not happy about but seems like the right thing to do. If a codec comes along that all the vendors can agree to implement, then it is likely that will go into the spec, but until then it will remain blank.",1273571159

1337335,comment,1333424,1334892,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"As a closet pragmatist I've always felt that ""existence"" is not a binary quality, but fuzzy.  Things like 0, 1, 2 and 256 have a ""strong existence"", whereas 38476532 has a very weak existence.  You can relate this to saying that the strength of existence is inversely proportional to the size of the turing machine required to compute it.<p>In this way, infinity of any form doesn't actually exist.<p>Add to the mix the axiom of infinity and it then does exist, but we're close to the constructivist's world.<p>However, having said that, there's a lot that I do that relies, underneath, on having the more usual model.  Allowing the declaration of the existence of all elements of 2^S for any set S is just too useful not to explore. That's the world I usually inhabit.<p>However, it's not clear that getting into those discussions will, in any way, help people to understand the more ""regular"" viewpoints and reasoning.  Encouraging people's intuition can be good, but sometimes it simply prevents them from reasoning clearly.<p>And perhaps that's the most easily defensible aspect of the usual idea (within mathematics) of infinity.  Dealing with it forces you not to take things for granted, and to reason carefully about properties.  Discovering that 1+aleph_0 = aleph_0 = aleph_0+1 from first principles is useful.  Then finding that 1+omega != omega+1 is useful.<p>Mathematical logic and reasoning is so useful, we need places to exercise it.  This is one, there are others.<p>But personally, I like the idea that there are different sizes of infinity, and the resulting implications such as the Banach-Tarski theorem, the existence of uncomputables, and the tension between Zorn's Lemma and the well-ordering principle.<p>Although mostly it doesn't really matter.",1273569701

Opera's, and Mozilla's I believe, attempt to sneak a codec requirement in the spec (Theora) was shot down, and rightly so, because it falls outside of the scope of HTML5, just as the encoding of image files displayed through the img tag is outside of its scope.",1273568944

(Probably if Microsoft had implemented Theora then it would have been added back to the spec, as Apple would have been in a clear minority then, so complain to them too).",1273568718

The posted article is built on the idea that HTML5 requires H.264 when that is not the case at all. The spec does not specify a codec for use on the video tag, just as it doesn't for the img tag.<p>More importantly, the authors claim ""we can cut to the chase and try to get the HTML5 spec fixed--in which case the commercial vendors would have to fix their implementations in order to be considered compliant."" is bogus as well. The spec is a delicate balance. If something is spec'd out, but major vendors are not going to implement it, then you have accomplished nothing by putting it in the spec, and in fact, the spec actually harmful at that point because people will believe it is implemented correctly. The spec is only useful insofar as it is a set of things that all the players can agree to implement.<p>I do recommend reading through the email I linked to, in it Ian Hixie, by responding to emails he received, lays out a lot of the thinking that guided the making of the spec.",1273568607

The world was in a war where untold millions were killed and the outcome was anything but certain.  My guess is that Churchill had to juggle multiple aspects of the decision, but the outcome and his words were used to paint the most unflattering picture in the linked article, perhaps justified, perhaps not, likely somewhere in-between.  And I truly do appreciate counter viewpoints that expand my understanding of the world.  The tragedy and his racist viewpoints clearly deserve more prominence in the histories of him.<p>You attempt to discredit my take on Stalin with rhetorical flourish, so generously implying that “you don’t think I’m a neo-nazi”, yet you provide no evidence that he wasn’t a butcher.  While I don’t think you are an “uneducated fascist”, most attempts to propagandize pro-Stalin viewpoints come from…  Not a good way to change someone’s opinion if that is your goal.  You did make a good catch on the first google link, but hardly surprising when providing supporting references in HN comments.  Wikipedia has the number at 3-60 million, with 3 being the “officially” recorded number.

Michael Eisen might have different opinions on the best paths of research, and you probably have some things you think will pay off that he doesn&#x27;t, or he thinks will pay off that you don&#x27;t. It is entirely rational to look at the amount of money available to fund research from public sources and the amount available from private industry, and determine that the best way to save the world is to get that patent and license it aggressively.<p>And, if you&#x27;re Michael Eisen, you know that your colleagues are doing excellent work and only one person can own the patent, and that patent going to the Broad represents a significant loss to your colleagues&#x27; potential funding, so it&#x27;s entirely rational to decide the best way to save the world is to contest the patent aggressively.<p>If we, the onlookers, want to fix this, we need to fix the funding problem.

The frenzy around it overstates its importance.<p>Cas9 is significant as the first RNA-guided nuclease that we learned how to manipulate, but there are probably many more in nature. Hopefully we will be able to construct our own in short order.<p>We have had very high quality programmable nucleases for a long time. Nucleases are not the principal expense in genome engineering. Further, if you want to be sure that the cuts you make are correct and on-target you might want to take the time to use another system than Cas9/tracRNA.<p>However, dCas9 (disabled Cas&#x27;es) and friends <i>are</i> amazingly novel, in that they allow us to make huge libraries of targeted DNA binding complexes that don&#x27;t cut DNA, but let us pull particular things to particular places in the genome.

10968791,comment,10962784,10967307,0,0,spion,,,"See the problem with this explanation is again, it doesn&#x27;t explain the reasons why this is bad. I&#x27;m not saying the reasons don&#x27;t exist - on the contrary I agree they&#x27;re very much real. However I don&#x27;t think &quot;view logic, domain/business logic and database boilerplate code are intermixed in a single file&quot; qualifies as a straightforward, logical explanation. It simply doesn&#x27;t answer the &quot;why&quot; question at all.<p>Let me try and cover some of the reasons why. I&#x27;m sure you know about these reasons (and can probably list more), my goal is just to present an example of what I consider to be a straightforward logical explanation:<p>If domain/business logic is mixed with view logic, then it would not be possible to reuse the same logic in a different view. These changes happen more often than anticipated: for example, a PHP project that has the view logic separated from the domain/business logic can more easily get an API (a HTML is one view, a JSON API would be just another view)<p>Additionally separating database code from business logic lets you switch databases more easily or to give you multiple ways to access the data. For example, data may be directly fetched from an SQL database initially, then its determined that this is too slow and results need to be cached in Redis. If there is no separate code for the data access layer, you would need to locate every database query and make sure it queries the cache first.<p>So this is what qualifies as a straightforward, logical explanation for me: lets assume the opposite statement was true, then we demonstrate how this leads to a bad situation and why its bad (more bugs, more work, and so on).<p>Another would be doing a case study: we did X (mixed business logic and templates in this way), then when we wanted to do Y (present a different view V) we had to not only write new code (for the new view) but deal with this problem (uncouple the existing logic from the existing view). If we originally did otherwise (wrote the logic separately) this would&#x27;ve been the same or similar amount of work (demonstrate this) yet later we would not have to do the hairy decoupling (which took Z amount of time and caused N bugs)<p>I think the whole industry would do much better if we focused more on actual specific examples and case studies of problems and drawbacks of different approaches rather than giving vague descriptions of the current state and claiming its &quot;bad&quot;. Its just not helpful at all. There is so much reinventing the wheel in our profession simply because we are not communicating knowledge effectively. Frankly, most of it reminds me of religious dogma.",1453745684

I&#x27;ve spent the last year on React)<p>The real problem is mixing business logic and presentation, not mixing HTML and JS.  React is purely presentation & presentational logic (or should be, you can of course implement it poorly)<p>For Presentation, the HTML and JS are always coupled, whether you have them in separate files or not.  So in that sense, all React is doing is admitting a truth.<p>While embracing the coupling of that mix, React is ALSO pulling out a lot of logic: React encourages one source of truth (the state is in one spot, and drives the markup, but you never consult the markup to determine the state).  An error that is commonly seen in, for example, jQuery apps, is that some state is hanging around in application variables, while other times it&#x27;s in the current markup state, and the app will consult the markup to see what&#x27;s happening.  That&#x27;s not a built in jQuery problem, it&#x27;s just a common problem of implementation.<p>I&#x27;m not sold entirely on the React boat, but it does seem to directly address problems that I&#x27;ve encountered in other systems, and I expect whatever comes next will build from React principles rather than reject them.",1453745679

Static sites, or dynamic websites without the state problem to the end user, are naturally better off without a client-side app approach (though ajax is still beneficial and structuring your approach to ajax can make client app frameworks/libraries tempting)<p>However, when you start giving the user powers to manipulate data and make the manipulation of data a core function of a website, it becomes a web application.<p>Photoshop is an extreme example of a web app really, and perhaps the most basic web app would be something like a CMS or a forum. Hence why social networks and email clients are created as apps now: they involve repeated display and manipulation of elements which are liable to change.<p>Initial attempts to improve the user experience of such tools as online chat and mail were made by using Ajax and this has culminated in asynchronous Ajax and virtual DOM models in order to achieve a real-time effect without sacrificing accessibility and performance.<p>We went from reloading entire pages to reloading bits of pages to never loading those bits but rather constructing them on the front-end drawing data from APIs.<p>Now with React and similar libs, we are looking at a hybrid approach: exposing data via API but (ideally) constructing and emitting HTML on the server before pushing the app to the client where a virtual abstraction of the DOM is established, but where data can still only be manipulated in one direction. This means that there is no state issue, because while routing and other interactions are achieved client-side, their composition is determined on the server.<p>It&#x27;s almost a dialectic cycle of thesis, antithesis and synthesis.",1453745574

We are very used to this. If you program iOS apps for a living, you know this has always been the case. Every new version of Xcode and iOS breaks code. With Cocoa and CocoaTouch, the language can at times feel like nothing more than a way to call the ever-changing SDK APIs.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if your app is written Objective-C (a language that also continues to change every year), Swift, Ruby-motion, whatever... it&#x27;ll break on the new Xcode. If not, you think something is wrong and pray the issue does not arise later.<p>Anyways the syntactic and semantic updates to Swift are automated fairly well, anyways, so this not really a major pain point IMO.<p><i>> 2) Swift&#x27;s interaction with C++ is a non-starter, and many, many apps use C++.</i><p>True, many apps use C++. While, I, personally, would <i>love</i> to see C++ intro arrive before Swift 4.0 or 5.0, it&#x27;s a feature that for all practical purposes is a luxury that we can live with out.<p>Use an Objective-C wrapper, then call it from Swift. All C++ that is called in the UIKit layer should be wrapped in an Objective-C API&#x27;s anyways (UIViewController.mm is harmful!), so no big deal. The exception to this is, if you were trying to write an app in pure Swift. In that case, using C++ breaks the purity anyways, so you might as well use Objective-C wrappers.<p><i>> 3) Some C APIs are still quite difficult to use from Swift. Objective-C, being a strict superset of C, makes it very easy to use Core Audio, for instance. OpenGL interop can also be a bit frustrating.</i><p>Support is definitely good enough. Again, if you need more you can (and should) use both languages. Swift was designed to be used in an Objective-C codebase.<p><i>> 4) Swift&#x27;s &quot;functional&quot; idioms are weak and poorly implemented. If you can&#x27;t provide a true functional backdrop to these features, they probably shouldn&#x27;t even be in there. Coming from a real functional language, you&#x27;re in for nasty surprises in Swift if you casually use higher-order functions all over the place, because there is a lot of copying going on.</i><p>I disagree. I believe the functional constructs add a ton of utility to the language. The key is to understand how they were designed to fit into the langauge. It helps to be a bit of a language lawyer, but the compiler can optimize away copied value types in a way that references cannot be optimized.\nWWDC spoke a lot on value types, functional programming, and their possible design implications in Swift 2.0<p>see: <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015-408/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015-408/</a><p>and: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av4i3x-aZbM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av4i3x-aZbM</a><p>and: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgK8jaf8nlk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgK8jaf8nlk</a><p><i>> 5) Swift&#x27;s performance is definitely not, shall I say, &quot;swift,&quot; though hopefully that will eventually improve.</i><p>Swift is more than fast enough for applications development. Once an alternative to ARC rises (see comments bellow), it will be a competitor for real time systems.<p>ARC guarantees that there will be no pauses. With a language like go, you are blazing fast until the GC pauses everything. With ARC trade raw execution speed for a consistent and stable speed with no pauses or fluctuations in performance. This is because ARC is static. The retain/release code is injected at compile time. So while there is a performance overhead for allocating and deleting on the heap, there is no pause. To avoid the overhead, you can use structs instead of classes and protocol extensions for polymorphism.<p><i>6) Poor and confusing compiler errors.</i><p>The language was released in 2014. The error messages are being actively worked on. They were vastly improved with 2.0.<p>EDIT: to be fair, you did say &quot;I&#x27;m sure it will improve&quot;.",1453745319

The list of accidents and deaths caused by human stampedes and crushes should surely give you a pause before you reach for the keyboard once again to defend the much-cherished fear and introduce ever more carefully crafted denigrations.<p>Lastly, there is a distinction between fear itself (the emotion/passion) and the reflex action, and that being without fear doesn&#x27;t necessarily get rid of the reflex action which is indeed useful in avoiding danger, especially on those situations you mention. As for &quot;children who haven&#x27;t got enough experience to reason about the danger&quot; - that is besides the point as this discussion is pertaining to adults.<p>> Also, seriously, get a therapist. It&#x27;s been shown in psychological studies that trying to suppress emotions (of any kind) tends to lead to depression.<p>As suppression and repression (a hallmark of such practices as Vipassana and Stoicism, which HN is known to be fond of) are at much lower levels than normal in this body, your ill-informed and unsolicited suggestion to &quot;get a therapist,&quot; stemming as it does from your &quot;you astounding idiot&quot; insult, is cast aside in the waste bin where it rightfully belongs.<p>Meanwhile here is an useful word for you:<p><quote>\nprojection |prəˈjekSH(ə)n|\nnoun\n• the unconscious transfer of one&#x27;s own desires or emotions to another person: we protect the self by a number of defense mechanisms, including repression and projection.\n<endquote>",1453745201

Literally everyone is already using something for messaging - Hangouts, Messenger, Line, WhatsApp, etc etc. Unlike other areas of tech, <i>social messaging is a zero-sum game</i> where every user you gain means someone else loses a user. This is hard environment for any new product with no existing traction.<p>Messaging is also one of those things that is used so much that it&#x27;s driven heavily by habitual behavior. Which also means you have to break a user&#x27;s muscle memory/habits before you can have a shot at keeping them in the long term. The default for a competent messaging app is that people try your app out, think you&#x27;re cool, and then promptly go back to whatever they were using before, because you haven&#x27;t broken their old habit and/or haven&#x27;t formed a new one. 14-day cohort retention is going to be nearly zero in the default case.<p>Habit-formation within users is really, really, <i>really</i> f&#x27;ing hard.",1453745124

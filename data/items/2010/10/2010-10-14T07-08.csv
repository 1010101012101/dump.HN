I tried to setup a new a/b test for a site and it became 'not easy' when I wanted to track an adsense click as a goal.<p>I wrote a manual a/b test for the same site about 7 years ago, and got adsense click goals working with 40 variations of the page, after about a week of working on it after work at night after my regular job.<p>There is some jquery code you can add to track javascript events which would probably track adsense clicks, but it's 'not easy', ie: I might as well not pay for it.<p>Cool idea though!  I would pay for it if I could track adsense clicks without having to write code.  Also, having an option to select multiple dom elements at once would be nice.  In addition, logging into the web site and editing the html to add the code in the <head> tag would be nice too, especially since it's kind of a hassle for me to open eclipse and re-deploy to app engine at 1am when I am tired.<p>haha, hope this helps.",1287043062

Because they wanted to make sure apps that were written to take advantage of the new UI, rather than ported from purely keyboard driven UIs.  Why would they put a mouse UI on their first tablet, particularly when Microsoft has demonstrated what a mediocre result that gets you.<p>I see no reason why, having established touch UI patterns on iOS devices, Apple would have any reason not to start introducing such things on the desktop.<p>And really, have you been in a pickup lately?

The install took nearly an hour, the first time I tried to boot and several times thereafter things would hang before the boot splash, and when it did start X was performing so poorly that it was nearly unusable (terminal could not keep up with my typing, 2-3 second delay between clicking a menu and setting it, etc.). Apparently this is caused by a kernel bug with i7 processors and/or the X58 chip-set that will be resolved in coming versions, but I have no idea how they didn't catch this in beta.<p>I'm currently back to using Arch.

It doesn't do any ""fancy"" stuff like functional programming, it doesn't have a lot of ""sexy"" libraries and the community arround it is pretty much stuck in a fixed  big-enterprise mindset (""I don't care that it's easier to do it with tool x or y! We can't maintain anything else but Z!"") and a lot of Java developers have only experiences with Java which limits the way they try to solve problems.<p>The worst example of this was when I had to witness a friend of mine having to code a prototype for a handheld device in Apache Struts because ""that's what we know and we can enhance if you're not there"". He had to basically implement most UI interactions in Javascript so it was even close to usable.<p>If you would ask any Ruby/Python/Scala/Erlang/... developer about other languages or new technologies (noSQL databases, node.js, ...), chances are they will at least know something about it because they love their craft. Most ""only Java"" people I've met so far simply aren't particularly interested in anything that isn't directly related to their work.<p>p.s. this doesn't mean that there aren't great developers that use Java, I've met some amazing people that are fluent in Java, but for them it was just ""another language"" that they used, not ""the language"".",1287042179

In fact, there seems to be more counter-examples than examples when we look to the fact that the Middle East, India, China, and North America does not fit the pattern. The Middle East was technologically advanced in the 1500s, China was cited as a counter-example, and there was not much development in North America. In fact, the movement of people and ideas seems to contradict the authors thesis.<p>This conclusion also fails on closer examination. Superficially, this might work when comparing Europe as a whole vs. Africa as a whole, but Finland is also noted as a previous technological backwater with high GDP now. I'm skeptical of any predictive power of this model.<p>On the other hand, the author is relatively eloquent. I like the line: ""There's a Thomas Edison born every minute.

1790103,comment,1789924,1789924,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> In fact, the principal beneficiaries of Western largesse today -- African autocrats and dysfunctional regimes -- are themselves the main obstacles to development. If there's anything that ""must be done"" to spur future development, it's to create the conditions necessary to empower the ordinary individuals who will create new and unforeseen technologies out of old ones.<p>I agree with all of this.<p>After reading lots of history, it seems to me that the most enduring and effective form of government is the decentralized imperial republic. This is not a common viewpoint among non-historians, but the key elements of this form of government tend to produce healthy, growing, prosperous, safe societies. Here's the specific elements in more detail:<p>Decentralized means allowing local areas in the republic to set largely their own laws, have their own worship, and their own customs. The head government sets minimum standards, and local governors see to it that they are met. These are basic conditions of infrastructure like roads and hospitals, communications networks, defense/garrisons, a few universal laws, and taxation. Everything else is up to the local regional governor.<p>Imperial will be the most controversial element of this, because there's been a large movement for self-rule in the post WWII era. I think there's lots of merit to that movement, but I wonder if the baby has been thrown out with the bathwater to some extent. Imperialism works as a natural check and balance against corrupt government - in a world where imperialism is more acceptable, it's basically ""fair game"" to go conquer any dysfunctional place. Thus, you don't get governments like you have in Venezuela with the government bringing in trillions in oil money that supposedly belongs to the people, but 1/3rd of the population are living on less than a dollar a day, and then the country has one of the highest murder rates in the world and the government is basically a mafia. In an era where imperialism is acceptable, Chavez gets exiled or executed, and the Chinese or Americans or British or whoever install a local governor that brings peace, stability, infrastructure, and rule of law to Venezuela.<p>Republic means some form of representative democracy. I think representative democracy actually performs worse on average than monarchy because corrupt, waste, and crime gradually increase in republics until the nation breaks, and it's very hard for a single leader to clean house. However, republics don't fall under the trap of having one horrifically bad leader who ruins the entire civilization. It's a tradeoff. I thought the British Empire did a good job with this, with a balance between the House of Lords, House of Commons, some strong constitution-type documents like the Magna Carta, the military, and local governors. Power was distributed in a decentralized way. The Prime Minister or Monarch could step up and assert authority when times got dire or massive house cleaning was necessary, but most of the time the Empire had some significant republican democratic elements to it keeping the aristocracy in check.<p>Of course, this is all very unfashionable these days, and everyone compares ideas to the current era. But for producing high levels of science, commerce, invention, quality of life, safety, peace, rule of law, health, art, and other key things - decentralized imperial republicanism has absolutely outperformed just about every other form of government.",1287039896

From this variable you should be able to work backwards to the function that reads this data on page ready and instantiates some models and collections. From there, I&#x27;d study the model/collection code to see how they are configured for fetching data. If you tap in at this point, you can just request data directly via new models or collections.",1375167587

But there&#x27;s the centrifugal force, there&#x27;s it&#x27;s effect on any delicate machinery inside the capsule and there&#x27;s the potential for electromagnetic weirdness from any charge in the capsule. Also, the curve track would mean that a capsule going off the rails could go in a totally unpredictable direction.<p>Also, you&#x27;d durability as well as raw strength of materials will come in here since they&#x27;ll be trying to use the thing repeatedly.",1375167583
6125681,comment,6120140,6121090,3,0,rogerbinns,,,"What has changed over time are the constraints.  Nowadays if you want to store a number you can just do so.  NSDictionary deals with mappings.  You can just serialise data out and back again.  You don&#x27;t need to worry about memory until a crash says you are using too much, at which point Instruments points the finger.  You are unlikely to encounter most boundary conditions in your code (I don&#x27;t remember the last time malloc-equivalents returned no memory).<p>Back in the &quot;olden&quot; days, storing a number required thought.  8 bit processors could often deal with 16 bit values, but beyond that you were on your own.  You had to be very careful designing your data structures so they used the least memory possible.  Saving data was unreliable. There were often no debugging tools at all.  Some lucky folks had ICE[1] but most of us had to guess why the system hung.  All this meant you had to get low level because of the constraints.<p>But you know back in those olden days we didn&#x27;t have to have a comprehensive help system.  We could assume users were proficient.  We didn&#x27;t have to deal with security and attacks.  No networking.  Undo was rare, and if it existed was a single step.  Your code only ran in one human language.  So while we did have to care about the low level implementation details of the code, we didn&#x27;t have to worry too much about the rest.<p>The low level constraints are pretty much gone now.  The tools are great.  And you do have to worry about a lot beyond the actual implementation like usability, smooth animations (games had to worry about that in the olden days but in a different way), multiple languages, coordinating with other systems over a hostile network, attacks and a whole bunch more.  I&#x27;m glad for all this, because worrying about fitting data structures and a framebuffer in 16kb of memory didn&#x27;t make for a better app.<p>Being familiar with the low level is still sometimes helpful, but not that often.  It is also a heck of a lot more complicated - eg compiler produced code is not straightforward and logical.  Multiple levels of cache, cache policies, speculative execution etc make reasoning about data more difficult.  The majority of the time it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>Right now the majority of mobile apps behave rather poorly if you have more than one device.  In the future that will be a given.  UI is more likely to be goal driven with the system figuring best practises for meeting the goals, versus nudging things by pixels as is done today.  (Heck a user will probably do some combination of pointing, speaking, thinking and just plain old looking.)  I&#x27;d expect a more functional approach where immutable states are the unit of an app, and new states are produced via interaction and external updates with the states syncing across everywhere relevant instantly.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-circuit_emulator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-circuit_emulator</a>",1375167555

6125676,comment,6124462,6125644,1,0,tetha,,,"Also, another important thing to realize is: Simplicity is ambiguous and highly dependent on the target group. Or, put in other words, certain choices that might look hard or certain mechanisms that look complicated might end up being simple.<p>For example, in a small project, the simplest possible solution for a problem was to throw the full power of regexes at the user. Why? Because the audience was a number of developers who knew regexes and they needed the ability to match some strings.<p>In a similar vein, if my mom is cooking, it is actually simpler if the recipe doesn&#x27;t give her a billion choices how to do a simple step, just tell her that one step. She&#x27;ll do it the way she likes.<p>So, simplicity is actually pretty complicated, and removing the wrong choices and possibilities might make your program a lot harder to use.",1375167336

Look at the Background section of the patents for a hint. Pretty much all patents have them.<p>2.

Would you want to use a smartphone on which you have to manually distinguish between scrolls and pinches every time? Or one without bounceback?

So where you&#x27;d normally make() a []byte, you can instead get one from a list or buffered channel you made of old discarded []bytes. So that gets you back to malloc/free/new/delete, but you can at least do it only for the most performance-relevant allocations in your program and keep being lazy everywhere else.<p>Another sometimes-useful way to save allocations--not for a cache, but in general--is just to turn short-lived allocations into longer-lived ones: if fooBuf is used and thrown away by each of several calls to obj.baz(), then make a single fooBuf and store it as a (private) field on obj, assuming that doesn&#x27;t present thread-safety or other problems in the specific context.<p>There are certainly things you wouldn&#x27;t use Go for, but now you know more about reducing memory pressure in GC&#x27;d languages. :)",1375166124

Right ?<p>And as for measuring... it&#x27;s not cheap (developer time wise) to build a realistic enough model of your application and put realistic enough loads on it for long periods of time to test out each of your hypotheses (and GC theories do require long periods of load).

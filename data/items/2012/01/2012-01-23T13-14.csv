I am happy to pay them though as the services and infrastructure provided are exemplary.<p>Actually, the taxes per capita are about the same in the US and Germany.  In fact, they're about the same in all of the major western countries.  (Canada is actually a bit behind the US.)  Average tax rates are lower in the US, but that's because the US has higher GDP per capita.<p>Therefore,if Germans get better services, it isn't from more tax money.  Given that, it's absurd to think that US public services would improve given more money....<p>No - defence doesn't explain the difference.",1327327146

When you're short on sleep, you need it to get through the day, but the side effect is you end up staying up later than you need to. Also, if you want to get to sleep, avoid screens (TV, computer) for the last hour or two before bedtime and you'll find it's a lot easier (E-ink readers like the Kindle are great for this.) It's hard to switch gears from the stimulation of TV or a game and go to sleep unless you're already overtired.<p>A lot of this also depends on age, I suspect... I used to be a 1AM-type person in my 20s but as I've grown older, I find I naturally wake up at 7 AM or so anyway. By 11pm or so, I'm geting pretty useless.

3500325,comment,3498860,3499192,4,0,city41,,,"Kanban itself isn't key, but rather I think the key is having a plan.<p>Kanban is a process where you divide your work into stories, and place them on a visual board. You pull stories across the board into different columns as the story progresses. Typical columns are ""ready to pull"" (first column, this story is ready to begin work), ""in progress"", ""in test"", ""complete"". The idea is to focus on getting cards across the entire board, and having few cards in flight at a time. This is generally believed to increase productivity by avoiding the urge to multitask too much. It can also reveal bottlenecks in your team's process and generally is good at visualizing how your team gets things done. Which can be eye opening.<p>Since I'm all by myself, my kanban board is really just a fancy todo list. I am using <a href=""http://www.agilezen.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.agilezen.com</a> for my board. Trello is a more well known app along these lines, but purists disagree that Trello truly accomplishes Kanban because it's missing a few key Kanban concepts (whether that really matters is up for debate).",1327326995

I'm not certain that without empathy we <i>wouldn't</i> engage in the altruistic behavior, though it's likely we'd engage in less.

The break-down of voting rights and shares are directly bound to how the common stock (usually 35k in AT) is being split. When it comes to investment rounds, the investors either increase the common stocks or buy it from the other shareholders for the nominal price (the percentage of the common stock value). The whole process is strictly bound to a formal process (a notarial act), which can get quite expensive, which is the only down-side in the long run.<p>On the other hand, Ltds still have some shady smack for some reasons over here (one is that you're seen as being cheap), so when you're an Austrian or German company, I bet you gonna need to explain as a small startup why you have gone the Ltd path when talking to big potential customers, and I think this is something you want to avoid at that stage (""act like how you want to be seen, not like who you are"", and each serious company here is a GmbH).

(In a world where everyone had proper Internet connections, we wouldn't have companies selling GPL software on physical media at all.) This probably isn't profitable in many cases, especially when distributing directly to the consumer rather than building a product for other business.<p>There is another special case, but it's selling software in spite of the GPL; home routers, set top boxes, etc. Were they to use GPLv3 software, they'd have no way to protect against another company using their (potentially substantial) work on the software, building/copying the hardware design and creating cheap knock-offs within a few weeks of release, making it too costly to continue.<p>If a group of companies and individuals wanted to come together to build a new router platform where all would contribute back to it, but they could differentiate themselves on edge features, management interfaces, etc, the BSD license is good enough; and probably a better bet than the GPL.",1327324195

I completely agree, however if you break unit tests during a refactor, yet there is no functional change - bin the tests as long as you have end to end tests higher up. I should add that any new code you add should have unit tests around. E.g the new code added as per the refactor if needs be.<p>With good unit tests you can indeed refactor without fear, but we should not take the stance of never breaking any unit tests. Providing there is no functional change, break away! Such stance relies on end to end tests/pairing/some other process to ensure you are not breaking valid behaviour though.",1327324018

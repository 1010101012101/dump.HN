The conclusions you have drawn from it are premature, and, I suspect, indicate what you want to believe. The &quot;inane&quot; social movements you attack are based on a desire to achieve equality and fairness between genders. A desire for a better, fairer, more liberal world. Even if misguided, they have good intentions. Your attachment to gender essentialism is equally &quot;emotional&quot; and &quot;inane&quot; and a tad more suspicious.<p>All of which is unimportant. Even if there are innate biological differences between the sexes, they are at most trends, not hard barriers. There is almost complete overlap. I&#x27;ve personally seen every kind of behaviour from every possible gender identity. So it doesn&#x27;t make any sense to prejudge people by their gender, or force gender roles on children.<p>The issue of whether or not ADHD/ADD are real diseases, and whether children are being over-medicated is completely different to the issue of gender essentialism.

7223604,comment,7223023,7223370,18,0,camperman,,,"In honour-shame societies, there is simply no concept of internal remorse or guilt. The correctional vectors are external rather than internal. A member of such a society - and they&#x27;re almost always collectivist rather then individual - will strive to be honourable while avoiding shame. Here&#x27;s a Chinese person talking about the difference:<p>&quot;...A majority of the world is Chinese. So am I. We emphasize the extended family as a unit, we carry a monstrously vast line of traditions, and we even place surnames in front of personal names to show priorities in terms of identity. Certainly, not all of us follow the ways of our ancestors strictly, but this is due to the influence of, you guessed it, the Western world. But having been raised as in the first generation in this nation, I can say for certain that there are immense cultural differences. In particular, honor and shame rather than innocence and guilt are the issue: we do not think in terms of Jiminy Crickets in our heads, but rather base values on the group as a whole.<p>At gatherings, for instance, a father may yell at his child for being &quot;diu liên&quot;--throwing one&#x27;s face away, a lovely image for what it means to be, for lack of a better word, shameful. But even in instances of moral guilt, what happens? The same phrase is applied, whether the child was caught cheating on homework, stealing a bicycle, or throwing food across the room in a restaurant. In some cases, yes, manners are the issue, but for some reason, it is not the fact that the action was in itself wrong that one is condemned for--it is the fact that it brought shame, particularly to the family name. For this reason, perhaps, Asians in general have been advocates of stricter discipline, particularly corporal. Modern psychologists may claim that punishment does no good, but for the honor-driven parents, it certainly brings about the desired behavior modification.<p>Of course, there are more trivial examples. There is rarely a gathering in which people will not &quot;fight&quot; over the right to pay the bill. Of course, each will attempt to claim it first, (not because it is morally right, or because they really want to, but because it is honorable,) and they will attempt to excuse the others by elaborating on how embarrassing it would be to accept it. Then there is the stereotype of the high grades, the good schools, the countless extracurriculars, at least piano or violin, and so forth. For what purpose? To represent the family name. You will never hear the older generation say, &quot;It&#x27;s for your own good,&quot; whether in regard to an order, or a punishment, or anything, because it simply isn&#x27;t about us as individuals. And you will most certainly never hear, &quot;Don&#x27;t you feel bad?&quot; The Chinese are notorious for their stoic attitudes. It is sometimes joked that we as a race don&#x27;t even have emotions.<p>There is another silly game often played. One might say something intentionally belittling so as to win reinforcing praise from the other party, whether with regard to how a child never studies or how poorly the food is cooked. This, of course, is a cheap way to win, you guessed it, honor. As a result, the principle of limited good shows up all the time. People do not dispense presents or hospitality out of goodwill, but necessity, because it would be shameful to accept it without returning the favor.<p>Of course, a known tendency in such a society can be to become completely dishonest. So long as one is not caught, any means are fine. There is fierce competition and pressure, which is why it never surprised me that many of my fellow American- born Chinese peers ended up, in fact, doing this. They had become so obsessed with the outward favor that they took a Machiavellian approach to it all. It never once bothered them that they might be doing the wrong thing. It never once occurred to them to live for themselves. It never occurred to them that there was an internal concept of right and wrong. These are ideas foreign to us.<p>I was once reprimanded for inappropriate behavior during recess back in elementary school. When the teacher tried to explain how I might hurt the other children, how I should feel bad, and how I should say sorry, much of it did not make any sense, because I knew my parents would scold me for making them look bad. One view was individualistic, emotional, and personal. The other was collectivist, pragmatic, and social.&quot;",1392202179

The BSDs, for example, generally pride themselves on tighter coupling in the core OS than Linux has traditionally had. You can swap out <i>some</i> components from a default FreeBSD install, mostly more application-level ones (sendmail->postfix, clang->gcc), but the base system is integrated and does things one way, supporting some customization but not every kind of wholesale surgery you might want to do on it. You certainly can&#x27;t swap out the init system for another one in any kind of supported way. The same is pretty much true of most other Unixen, such as Solaris (which has a pretty integrated init system, too).<p>I generally like the utilities+pipes model, but for system stuff it&#x27;s seemed like false advertising to me for a long time anyway: the Linux kernel is monolithic, and many of its features (like cgroups) don&#x27;t make much sense unless you have some userspace counterpart configuring/arbitrating them and a uniform way of making sure everything gets set up consistently. Traditionally this is handled by a tangle of shell scripts with distribution-specific conventions to make sure they don&#x27;t step on each other&#x27;s feet (Debian has piles of this in Debian policy). That&#x27;s a unified system in practice, because you can&#x27;t really arbitrarily rewrite the init/configure/reconfigure scripts or swap things out and still have a working system that is Debian-integrated. The scripts are literally separate files on disk, but in practice they&#x27;re a spaghetti-code implementation of Debian Configuration, a monolithic system that handles initialization and services and package configuration and can&#x27;t be modified without extreme care if you want things to keep working in the way all the other packages (and apt, dpkg-reconfigure, the diversions system, etc.) expect.",1392201709

Even in an alternate environment such as systemd, those will always be complicated.<p>Things like changes in power or network addresses have been handled by OpenRC just fine (<i>note: that was opinion, and systemd is better in some cases). More important,y those requirements do not suggest a need to bind tools together into one package, thoug; instead, they suggest a </i>well-defined API* (or ABI) is needed. In OpenRC, that is simply another runlevel that you trigger on power-plug changes, etc.<p>Your argument seems to be that the using many tools is too complex (even though each tool in isolation is much simpler, reduced in scope, and is likely to have fewer bugs), while tying that functionality together is faster to develop (despite makng the problems into a complex, interdependent mess). Despite being labeled an &quot;april fools joke&quot;, RFC 1925 [2] has important wisdom. In particular, there seem to be a lot of people ignoring Truth #5:<p><pre><code>    It is always possible to agglutinate multiple separate problems\n    into a single complex interdependent solution. In most cases\n    this is a bad idea.\n</code></pre>\nThis is really a restatement of the UNIX design philosophy. Or maybe you&#x27;re prefer this version, written by some old hackers you may have heard of[3]<p><pre><code>    Even though the UNIX system introduces a number of innovative programs and\n    techniques, no single program or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes\n    it effective is the approach to programming, a philosophy of using the computer.\n    Although that philosophy can&#x27;t be written down in a single sentence, at its heart\n    is the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among\n    programs than from the programs themselves. Many UNIX programs do quite trivial\n    things in isolation, but, combined with other programs, become general and useful\n    tools.\n</code></pre>\nThis idea about <i>keeping problems separated</i> was true when those guys wrote UNIX in the first place, it was true wen Dijkstra suggested structured programming instead of &quot;goto&quot;, it was true when Alan Kay suggested sending Messages between Objects for yet more encapsulation, and countless other examples throughout the history of software. It is still true now.<p>If you&#x27;re having a hard time seeing this, I suggest you re-examine the problem and ask if an <i>API</i> could tie the pieces together, because it probably already exist in an unspecified form.<p>> Finally, no one is forcing you to use a systemd based distribution.<p>Of course not, but the monopolistic tactics being used to vertically integrate systemd IS forcing a problem - on purpose - with various other tools such as udev and gnome.<p>I&#x27;m obviously going to stick to Gentoo for desktop use, but even there, the disruption caused by systemd has caused a significant mess by <i>breaking</i> previously-working software <i>on purpose</i>.<p>--<p>1: If this is merely a hatred of BourneShell/BASH, I would actually understand that as it certainly has its layers of cruft and gotcha/wtf behavior.

How do you compare political assembly membership with collective plotting on political issues while washing laundry down by the river?  Does it matter if the man&#x27;s wife will likely know how he voted?",1392200670

It can track whether or not an individual <i>process</i> started from inittab is still running, but for large multi-process servers this is not all that practical as a process monitoring method. Hence the proliferation of process monitoring applications.<p>More importantly, since there&#x27;s no ordering or dependency control, I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> seen a system rely on init for process monitoring this way for all its services. In practice, a bunch of pieces gets started in the init scripts, and all monitoring ends up placed externally <i>or</i> you then start a process monitor like Daemontools.<p>The problem is that all of these process monitors depends on a relatively benign environment where they are not messed with, and where they themselves are so rock stable that they never end up orphaning the services they start.<p>In practice, while Daemontools for example is well written and as stable as it <i>can</i> be, by virtue of running outside pid 1 it is not immune to the effects of the surrounding system. It can, and does, end up orphaning monitored processes in a variety of circumstances (say the OOM killer runs amok after your system ran ludicrously low on memory).<p>When that happens, unless your app was exceedingly well written, and the vast majority of server processes I have to deal with on a daily basis are not, your process is now unmonitored <i>and</i> you have no good way of controlling the process other than killing it and restarting. Finding pid-files have been overwritten, or are empty (say the disk ran full too, while it was being written) and multiple instances running is a fairly common scenario.<p>By running as pid 1, systemd is protected against being killed. By then applying cgroups it can precisely track whether or not what was spawned is still running, even if it forks more stuff. By applying this to the boot process, it can provide this functionality to everything that gets started during boot.<p>This is functionality that init does not provide, and none of the process-monitors running outside of pid 1 can provide.<p>It may not solve problems you have, but I&#x27;ve had to deal with the fallout of process monitors running outside of pid 1 more than I care to remember.",1392199985

You sound cynical about the likely effectiveness of the political campaign, I know I am, but the really big problem with this whole issue is about abuse of power and how we arrange society. In my opinion, any &#x27;solution&#x27; that doesn&#x27;t address the political side is not really a solution at all.",1392199566

Inspecting all parameters on all transactions since the genesis, like you&#x27;d already have to do to verify they are not stealing or creating money from nothing?  The inspection you have to do just to locate even the same transaction you submitted to the network yourself, to verify it was accepted?  And you have to spend like 10 whole seconds of CPU time doing this, per ~10 minutes that a new block comes out, verifying the transactions from the last 10 minutes?  Golly, that is sooooo much more onerous than just running the blockchain securely! /sarcasm<p>I&#x27;ll agree that it&#x27;s embarrassing, misleading, not documented well, and not gracefully handled by the community now that everyone points their fingers at each other.  But you are deliberately making it sound worse by re-describing standard parts of the bitcoin protocol, as if they are new requirements in order to get a sane ID.  Anyone writing financial software should be more than capable of quickly adding a few function hooks into the existing process to get a deterministic normalized ID, and the amount of extra computing resources is negligible compared to what you already have to do, just to use bitcoin safely.",1392199462

199626,comment,199231,199231,0,0,msg,,,"This comment will be a little roundabout, but it has a real conclusion.<p>It seems like the subject of this Google Tech Talk keeps coming up over and over again.<p><a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2469649805161172416"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2469649805161172416</a><p>Here's a summary. Yann Le Cun discusses his research on deep learning. The basic problem with standard learning, SVMs, neural networks and the like is that they are limited to coming up with shallow templates for classification, with more or less fancy versions of linear and nonlinear combinations of weights. The number of such templates you need in a highly dimensional space like computer vision is exponential (think about how much data you need to represent one object at different combinations of distance, lighting, orientation, focus, etc.).<p>Instead, he suggests, we need to learn how to get past shallow template-matching and train, essentially, features of features or networks of networks. This gives us a shot at discovering highly abstract features of the data we have and doing real learning.<p>If you have any interest in the subject, I strongly suggest you carve out an hour for the video.<p>TD-Gammon is another example. It is a learning program that plays backgammon. Training from simple board features, it eventually derived what you might call first-order expert features by doing shallow learning. But, when similar first-order expert features (presence of an anchor, etc.) were added by hand to the initial state space, TD-Gammon derived deeper expert features to the point that it and similar programs became better than the best players in the world.<p>The point here is that there was no way to transition from the shallow features to the deep features without recoding the system from scratch. That obviously won't scale to the kinds of AI problems that are interesting.<p>Big finish: The advantage humans have over computers (at the moment) is that we work on those multiple levels of abstraction all the time. We do deep learning in every field of human endeavor. That's what the deeply connected neural networks in our brain are all about. In fields where such expertise is possible, humans have it all over the computers. In fields where brute-force calculation can win, the computers have it all over the humans.<p>What that implies to me is that we can't train computers to think as deeply about catastrophes as we do. It requires a new paradigm of learning to get the computer to that point.",1211737928

199624,comment,199493,199493,0,0,gunderson,,,"I've tried 5 different keyboards, none of which have made much difference.  Others have posted some of these but I'll share my list of what has worked:<p>- take frequent typing breaks -- even 10 to 15 second breaks work wonders.<p>- stay happy and relaxed, stress is bad.  Also, RSI pain can increase stress.  Breaks and a chill frame of mind help address this.<p>- massaging the fingers/wrists under hot tap water first thing in the morning and several times during the day.  this feels great and helps focus your mind on relaxing the muscles.<p>- anti-inflammatory drugs (your doctor may want to prescribe one to help the healing)<p>- don't pound on the keys.  My years using an ""M"" keyboard got me pounding them pretty hard.  I've had to try to unlearn this technique and just use a softer touch.",1211737691
199623,comment,199549,199549,0,0,swombat,,,"Of interest to me is the following idea:<p>As technology advances, and each generation learns to be even less inhibited than the last, will we progressively reach a point where most people are completely transparent online? Where everyone carries a live webcam on their shoulder (or some other place)?<p>If so, what will happen to prudishness and other taboos? If it goes that way, if everything you do is visible to all, surely this will mean that we need to redefine right and wrong, because as a society we can accept that most of us do ""wrong stuff"" so long as we can shut it out - but for instance, if 50% of people were found to, say, cheat on their partners, surely that would be a tremendous force to make cheating quite acceptable. This could apply to all those kinds of taboos.<p>Daniel",1211737675

Here's what helped me:<p>- Less stress, more happiness.  This was probably the biggest issue for me.  Stress made everything worse.  Do whatever you need to do to get happy.  I quit my job and went on vacation for a month.  I also became less willing to do things that made me unhappy.<p>- Less typing.  A lot of people just can't type 12 hours a day, everyday.  Come to grips with it, and put yourself on a schedule.  Find other things to do.  Cut out non-essential typing like IM, etc.  Take regular typing breaks.  If you can, take some time off and don't even look at a computer for as long as possible.<p>- More exercise.  I'm not sure it even matters if you're exercising the problematic muscles.  Just improve your overall health.<p>- Goldtouch keyboards.  These split into an A-shape, so I don't have to pronate my wrists while typing, which was a problem for me.  I tried a lot of keyboards, and these are the ones that helped me.  Go ahead and spend a bunch of money trying unusual keyboards and desk setups, it's worth it.<p>- Acupuncture seemed to help a little.  I tried pretty much everything anyone suggested.  Most other wacky alternative medicine didn't help.<p>- Tiger Balm.  Excellent tingly sensation!  Also seems to reduce swelling, which was causing problems for me.<p>Here's what didn't help me:<p>- Wrist stretches.  I think these may have actually made things worse for me.<p>- Chiropractic.  This made impressive popping noises, and produced no other effects I could discern.  Also, it has an adjective for a name.<p>- Dvorak.  The Dvorak layout is designed for speed, not necessarily wrist health.  The independent finger movements needed to hit those home-row vowels hurt me bad.<p>- Doctors.  I recommend you see one, but in my case they weren't very helpful.  I was diagnosed with CTS, but reading about it, my symptoms didn't remotely match.  Wrist braces did nothing.  Physical therapy did nothing.  Maybe I didn't see very good doctors.",1211737195

199613,comment,199231,199604,0,0,kurtosis,,,"This article is very interesting, thank you for posting it. I haven't read it yet, but it seems possible that this review suffers from a kind of selection bias, in that the only SPR's which have appeared in the literature are those which were more successful than human experts.  This does not mean that a widespread switch to SPR's would outperform human experts, because the average implementation could be inferior to human experts. Consider how difficult it is for IT departments to follow best practices in security.<p>another aspect of these systems which people may find repugnant is that they allow one to weigh the costs and benefits of different treatment decisions in a consistent way.  I personally feel, after watching people I loved suffer in an oncology ward that denying treatments which are very expensive but have small probability of success would be a good thing, but I know other people don't feel this way and there would be outrage.",1211736184

Why would you want to send packets over a public network with no guarantee of throughput? Well, it greatly increases the connectivity between hosts and it significantly reduces costs. However, it is less secure.<p>Likewise, why would you want to send data via application-level multicasting? Again, it greatly increases connectivity between hosts, some of which may be behind firewalls. Furthermore, it greatly improves the efficiency of data distribution because the reduces the significance of the bandwidth of the initial host.<p>At present, there is some duplication of effort. Some duplication is to avoid proprietary interests. Some duplication allows specific types of data to be handled. Finding and promoting a more general solution would be desirable.",1211735393

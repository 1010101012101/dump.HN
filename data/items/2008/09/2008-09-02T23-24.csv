You can see arguments for both sides if you're paying attention.<p>All I'm saying is that just because you've made a conclusion a priori doesn't mean it's a bad idea to write about it. That's how argument and discussion works. It's only a bad thing when you've proven yourself wrong and you refuse to admit it.",1220399784

I think its easy to take a micro-scale view of browser development and see the weekly press releases that come one after another and declare that this feature is an answer to that feature and ignore the long development ramp-up time that each improvement required.",1220399513

293363,comment,292813,293030,0,0,comatose_kid,,,"I think your post is an example of why social science isn't.  You've strung together a few opinions with no backing evidence.<p>1:  'player/whore dynamic' I think that is a bit of a generalization.  And I think the follow up statement is pretty weak: 'Empirically, the vast majority of people who participate in casual sex have low self-esteem'.  Even on the minor chance this was true, you haven't shown that the lower self esteem isn't from something other than their sexual relationships (eg parental figure).<p>Where is your proof for 2)?  What if both partners have engaged in casual sex?<p>Point 3:  I find it hard to agree that 'The medium of exchange is social status' wrt casual sex.  Aren't you assuming one or more of the parties is 'kissing and telling'?  The medium of exchange is pleasure.<p>Point 4:  When were societies pre-monagamous?  Is it reasonable to think that 1 in 3 men would die at the hands of a male due to sleeping around (and it would be neat to see a reference for this surprising stat)?<p>I'd be totally surprised to learn that 'pre-monogamous subculture' leads to violence and rape.  And speculating on the reason that fights break out at night clubs is pretty faulty supporting evidence.",1220398938

293359,comment,293192,293306,0,0,litewulf,,,"Sorry I read this as a very ""oh no there are services I like that are being supplanted by Google ahhh!""<p>Simply, there are lots of things I would consider relatively obvious shoe-ins for inclusion in browsers. Searchable web archives seem one of those (its easy to say ""I remember seeing a site about it"", but sometimes hard to remember exact details) and the obvious response is that some services will die off if they fail to provide compelling new functionality, and some will live on.<p>In the same way, Google or Yahoo search results are way different from what they used to be. I remember people worrying about technorati as search engines began getting better at returning blogs as search results when in the end I think its good that I don't have a different search engine for each source of information. This progression is natural and healthy, and worrying about one product over another is rather needless.<p>Love products for the functionality or the possibilities they allow, not the logo on them. If something better comes along then by all means switch instead of worrying about the health of the old thing.",1220398605

293349,comment,292980,293056,0,0,technoguyrob,,,"Notice Chrome is slower in the first test because of the AJAX declarations. But honestly, who is going to be worried about the speed of AJAX declarations? Look at this comparison:<p>Chrome:
Array object	
131
Date object	
30
Error handling	
7
Math object	
13
RegEx object	
52
String object	
41
DOM	
51
Ajax declarations	
295
Total Duration	
620<p>Opera:
Array object	172
Date object	47
Error handling	31
Math object	47
RegEx object	109
String object	63
DOM	31
Ajax declarations	62
Total Duration	562<p>If we assume Google can get AJAX declaration down to 62ms just like Opera (which seems perfectly reasonable, I don't imagine they had those in mind when considering speed), ten that would bring Chrome's execution time down to:<p>387ms!!<p>Assuming it can get a few more milliseconds down (it is after all only in beta stage, now that it's been open-sourced I can imagine a good couple of improvements will stream in), that means it's 1.5x faster than Opera! (which is hailed as the absolute king of Javascript execution)<p>Also, Opera does some kind of caching thing I think. On some of the tests (like Array and DOM), Opera consistently scored eiter X or 2X (e.g., 90, or 180). There is no way there could be a 2x speed difference just out of thin air like that, so I imagine it's some trick that notices when it can be sped up. If Chrome did that it could have the speed gain as well.",1220397163

Now, I'm going to try to be constructive; The site is nifty but it's unremarkable - it's not that your site isn't cool it's just not engaging to users. Maybe a place to log in - so a user can post a review?  Or maybe a place to post questions about products?",1201186245

I pulled an all-nighter on a Saturday for a problem set not due until Thursday so as to avoid the crowds.<p>After the class was over I didn't use Scheme for another 10 years, but did everything in C.  Scheme was just too slow in 1987.  Both the language implementations and the hardware have come a long way.  I use Scheme all the time now, and there are numerous popular languages, notably PHP and Ruby, that are slower than Scheme today.",1201184545

You can ignore the expected effects in the middle.  (In fact, there's no direct correlation to cheaper credit and greater investment.)<p>4% is stated core inflation.  The true inflation number is much higher, but it's hard to know because there's a lot of effort put into diminishing it, for obvious reasons.  Sure we're not in hyperinflation yet, but the idea is that it could get there quickly.  While it seems impossible from the comfort of growing up in the second half of the 20th century, America is in much more trouble than it realizes.",1201184357

103462,comment,102863,103407,0,0,rkts,,,"Functional programmers tend to avoid iterators since they aren't referentially transparent.  Instead, operations on collections are expressed with higher-order functions that map or fold some function over each element.  If you need a first-class ""conventional interface"" to sequential data, the preferred structure is the linked list.<p>Hash tables in functional-style languages often let you specify a hash function.  That means the hash function is a property of the collection, rather than the objects in it.  If you prefer a more ""object-oriented"" design, you can use an object system such as tinyclos to define a generic hash function.  But Schemers usually like to avoid such complexity.<p>Looking at the PLT documentation, I see that its hash tables don't let you specify a hash function.  That's definitely a shortcoming, though arguably not a serious one in practice.  SRFI 69 gets this right.",1201183256

1674526,comment,1674103,1674103,0,0,Poiesis,,,"Don't assume things.<p>When you're developing, there are a thousand little decisions to be made.  Don't assume that the server will be up before the client.  Don't assume that the file you open will be writeable.  Don't assume that the database is there.  Don't assume that the user knows what you know.  Don't assume everything works.<p>Maybe it's because I spend lots of time in teams developing large (overly) complicated systems, but a common problem is simply finding out <i>what went wrong</i>.  Strictly speaking, you can sometimes accept something as a precondition if it is explicitly stated as such--but you still at a minimum need to at least fail loudly and obviously if it doesn't do what you expected.  Silent failures suck.<p>Don't assume anything while debugging, either.  As mentioned elsewhere, when debugging I find it useful to take the symptom and think of <i>every possible failure</i> that could could cause the symptom.  Then, start paring down the list by doing more tests.  Do not assume anything.  Don't assume the cables are connected.  Don't assume the code is current, or the driver is working, or the the library documentation is correct.  Verify, verify, verify.<p>By all means, use your experience to prioritize your search space.  I personally prioritize stuff that's easy to check, or stuff that's known to have a problem.  Of course, I generally suspect my own code long before turning my gaze toward third-party components.  But don't assume!  Remember the old saying, ""it's not a compiler bug?""  Well, yeah--that's really the last thing I'd suspect.  But if I ruled everything else out, I'd at least do a Google search to see if anyone at least brought up the possibility.<p>But of course, I've never gotten that far.  So far, every debugging problem has been reducible to a failure to check my assumptions.<p>There's a fantastic Mark Twain quote that I was amazed to find the other day; apologies if I've included it here before: “It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.”",1284011910
1674525,comment,1674103,1674254,0,0,yason,,,"There's no clean path with regard to this.<p>Either you plan too much ahead and you end up tweaking your design forever, eventually building high-level cruft code that still won't get anything done because you don't dig deep to the ground to find the real culprits of your solution.<p>Alternatively, you plan nothing at all and end up rewriting your program several times because you just won't see the big picture as you're just digging up dirt from many different spots.<p>I think it works best if you plan only as much as you initially can and then start coding a proof-of-concept version as quickly as possible. You can only plan what you know of, and it's not much at first but it's something. Quickly getting to coding helps you understand the problem better, and you <i>will</i> throw away a many approaches that turn out to be suboptimal or solutions to the wrong problem, but there's nothing wrong with that. When the coding brings in more knowledge, then you can plan a bit more, and repeat.<p>If you're good, you can do that most of the most of the time. A conservative estimate might be half the time. More importantly, you will never hit the optimal planning versus coding point but you wave around on the both sides, sometimes planning too much and sometimes coding too much.<p>Experienced programmers can keep the amplitude of that zigzagging low, inexperienced programmers rush from endpoint to endpoint doing too much either.",1284011905

The premise is that connections are good, and the easier they are to make, the more you'll connect.<p>Building on that, for businesses, the easier it is for a customer to connect to you, the more likely they'll connect (though I'd love to back this up with some research data).  Hopefully, a prominently placed QR code (e.g, on a door, menu, or advertisement) will be a strong visual cue to a customer to connect (since the business can't actively initiate the connection).<p>All of the core service will always be free.

1674470,comment,1674103,1674103,0,0,anatoly,,,"Being aware of and managing my ignorance.<p>I don't know if I can describe this very well, and I've only recently started explicitly noticing this about myself, but I seem to have a well-developed intuition of how much I am ""in the dark"" about a particular domain, problem, technology, library, behavior, etc. I seem to sense well (and can back up with explicit arguments if necessary, but it stars with a feeling) when there's too much darkness around me, and then my primary focus must be on learning/understanding/tinkering/iterating to make it go away, rather than groping around in it. But it's also important to know when to stop, to avoid the danger of depth-first devouring of information that can consume too much time (not unlike ""wikipedia surfing"", when you suddenly come to and realize you've been reading it for three hours).<p>I never imagined this to be any kind of special ability, until I started noticing that some otherwise competent people seem to lack it. So perhaps it's a useful habit, and perhaps it can be cultivated, but I'm not sure how, except by trying to be aware of your ignorance as much as possible.<p>This principle seems to apply in different situations: when designing, when debugging, when writing code to interact with someone else's code. It always pays to maintain a mental model that includes the gaps, and to estimate how important filling the gaps is.<p>For example, when debugging a difficult problem, like an elusive bug or mysterious behavior, I usually make conjectures of where the problem could broadly originate, and try to rule them out one by one. Maybe I can ask if things are already ""bad"" after this place or before this place in the source code. Maybe I can vary or reduce interaction with other systems to rule out the problem there. I'm half-explicitly half-intuitively dispelling the ""darkness"" around my understanding of the problem, forcing it to hide in fewer and fewer places. Suppose that one of the plausible conjectures is that this mysterious behavior may be caused by a bug in a core library or the compiler/interpreter of the language. I may need to ""dive"" there and start reading much unfamiliar code to learn and understand those domains, but I'm going to postpone this until absolutely necessary, and rule out easier domains first. I'm managing my ignorance explicitly.<p>(Now that I'm thinking about it, maybe this is why many people, including myself, often prefer debug prints to working in a debugger - debug prints are good at giving you useful negative information: ""it's still OK here, the bug's not here"". When working interactively with a debugger, this is more difficult to get at).<p>Or imagine that you're thinking about how you will use a standard component - an SQL database, a ""NoSQL"" database, a network library, S3, a language, anything. Assume you understand the API. How much do you know about the constraints and limitations of that component, and how much <i>should</i> you know? I don't feel the need to throw together a piece of code that uses connect(), accept(), send() etc. before I use sockets pervasively, but if it were my first time writing a network client/server, I probably would. I've never used S3, so merely reading about it and reading the API wouldn't be enough to start something big using it. I'd have to tinker a little first, get some intuitive, dispel some darkness. All this seems rather trivial to write out, but I think that we fail to act this way surprisingly often. I've seen people write multi-threaded programs in pure Python, complete with starting multiple threads, using locks, etc., oblivious to the existence of the GIL and the fact that they're losing rather than improving performance. I've almost done the same thing myself when I was new to Python (I still think that Python hides this aspect of its behavior much too well from outsiders and beginners, and am a little chagrined over it).<p>Premature optimizations usually fall under this principle as well. When I'm optimizing prematurely, it's because I am not uncomfortable enough with the amount of darkness around the behavior of my system. I don't actually have a good understanding of where the bottlenecks are now or may be in the future, but it doesn't bother me <i>enough</i>; I'm groping in the dark without realizing it. If I do realize it, I will step back, try to look at my system with a critical eye and do some hard measurements before I try to optimize. This will usually be a good thing.",1284009961

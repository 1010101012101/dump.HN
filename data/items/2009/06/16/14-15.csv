Plenty of people are prescribed Adderall without having any real tests done, just by saying ""I can't focus!"" because they want a study helper.<p>All I'm saying is there are health risks regardless of your ADHD.  It isn't as if having ADHD magically makes me immune to the side effects of Adderall.  I have trouble sleeping at times and other weird effects, too.  I keep my doctor up to date and get regularly checked up on.<p>Also, you can have ADHD <i>and</i> be an alcoholic / smoke weed / be paranoid / depressed.  As I said, I 100% agree you should go to a doctor... I'm just saying that my ADHD doesn't give me ""amphetamine immunity"" or anything magical.",1245164360

That doesn't mean you should prefer COBOL over APL.  It's a result of the fact that you can express more in a line of APL than in a page of COBOL.  And, in fact, that line of APL is easier to write and easier to read than that page of COBOL.<p>Ideally, any time you're solving a problem that's a small variation of a problem somebody has already solved, you should be able to write your program by referencing their solution and describing the variation.

So if you want to be rigorous you end up with a meticulously detailed switch block (or whatever the idiom is in your language) with a lot of repeated code and global variables everywhere.

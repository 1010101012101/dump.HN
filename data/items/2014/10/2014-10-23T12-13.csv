8497867,comment,8497233,8497657,0,0,Swizec,,,"I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time in the US recently and it&#x27;s normalised my accent a lot. It&#x27;s become undefinable. People back home tell me I don&#x27;t sound like them when I speak, but that I don&#x27;t sound quite American either.<p>Americans make fun of how I pronounce certain words (which actually helps a lot in normalising my accent), but they can&#x27;t place the accent either. Nobody guesses that I&#x27;m slavic, a lot of people ask if I&#x27;m Brazilian or from some random European country.<p>A large part of the confusion probably stems from the fact I use colloquialisms and even colloquial speech patterns, like, correctly.<p>With prolonged stays in the US my accent is going to normalise further, but I think that getting completely rid of it would require some sort of accent coach. So far the only motivation for doing so is that being told <i>&quot;Wow your English is so good!&quot;</i> is getting annoying. I was proud when people told me that ten years ago, but it feels silly now.<p>But a big benefit of maintaining my foreigner status is the freedom it affords me. I can use British slang, Aussie slang, East coast slang, West coast slang, even Canadian slang and nobody minds or finds it odd. Whereas if I sounded like somebody who grew up in California and used a British turn of phrase, it would sound hella weird.<p>And, obviously, I feel a certain level of smugness when I use British words that Americans don&#x27;t understand because then I get to call them plebes and mock them with my larger vocabulary. (Americans get really upset when a foreigner is better at something than they are, it&#x27;s funny)",1414069149

8497865,comment,8497288,8497816,0,0,Alex3917,,,"> It is not undoubtedly true that much medicine is based on religious superstition and racism (nor does the article linked here either make or justify that claim).<p>That&#x27;s literally what the entire article is about...<p>&quot;How did our modern binary between ‘illicit drug’ and ‘valuable medicine’ come into being?<p>Drugs have had a bad reputation since at least the time of Shakespeare, whose sleazy, potion-dispensing apothecary in Romeo and Juliet enables that play’s tragic finale. Shakespeare tended to associate drugs with things such as witches (‘mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected’) or Catholic assassins (‘drug-damn’d Italy’). But in the 17th century, drugs acquired associations with the non-European world: the fever-ridden islands of the Caribbean, tropical Africa, or the exoticised ‘East Indies’.&quot;<p>&quot;For Christian Europe, the medicinal virtues of foreign drugs such as coffee, tea, opium and cinchona (source of quinine) were counterbalanced by their origins in the lands of heathens.&quot;<p>&quot;The King of England himself joined a public chorus of voices attacking ‘Indies drugs’ as unhealthy and un-Christian. [...] James regarded smoking as a demonic custom from the shamanic cultures of the New World, evoking the ‘horrible Stigian smoke of the pit that is bottomelesse’.&quot;<p>&quot;James wasn’t alone in demonising drugs. Inquisitors in Mexico City portrayed indigenous users of peyote as sorcerers, and Jesuit priests deep in the Amazon jungle sent back anxious reports about a plant called ayahuasca that allowed shamans to gather knowledge from evil spirits. Even the humble coffee bean provoked outraged diatribes about a ‘foreign liquor’ that had ‘bewitched’ consumers, causing enfeeblement, impotence, and worse.<p>Psychoactive drugs thus stood at the centre of debates about imperialism, religion, and globalisation, as well as science. They still do.&quot;<p>&quot;Since at least the 1970s, practitioners of Western medicine have begun to pay greater heed to the flip side of their empirical tradition. Scientists have conducted experimental trials of tropical botanicals that colonial-era doctors dismissed as tools of witchcraft and 20th-century drug companies regarded as quackery.&quot;",1414069106

It may not because, e.g, the length of the cycle may be the same for every prime divisor of the number being factored.<p>Similarly, the complexity of the quadratic sieve is heuristic because there is no known way to prove that (sqrt(n) + i)^2 - n results in the same distribution of smooth integers than that of a random sequence of the same size. Dixon&#x27;s algorithm [1] turns the quadratic sieve provable (but much slower in practice) by sampling randomly instead of sequentially. Sieving is thus no longer possible, but we get a subexponential running time of L_n[1/2, 2 sqrt(2)]. The hyperelliptic curve factorization algorithm [2, 3] is another probabilistic but provable algorithm with a more efficient but not provable counterpart, the elliptic curve method [4].<p>The blog post only seems to care about <i>deterministic</i> factoring algorithms, though. There are indeed no known deterministic factorization algorithms with better than exponential complexity.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1981-36-153/S0025-5718-1981-0595059-1/home.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1981-36-153/S0025-5718-1981...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://math.dartmouth.edu/~carlp/hyperI.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://math.dartmouth.edu/~carlp/hyperI.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://math.dartmouth.edu/~carlp/PDF/paper129.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://math.dartmouth.edu/~carlp/PDF/paper129.pdf</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/3826/346_086.pdf?sequence=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/3826/...</a>",1414068409

(It simply means medicine that isn&#x27;t based on the principle that &quot;like cures like&quot;, i.e., that a remedy for a disease with certain symptoms will be something that causes those same symptoms. Since that principle is bullshit, and cases where &quot;like cures like&quot; arise only rarely and by coincidence, essentially all medicine is allopathic.)<p>2. It is not undoubtedly true that much medicine is based on religious superstition and racism (nor does the article linked here either make or justify that claim). In particular, I doubt it.

The recreational uses of ethanol are, of course, well known, although the line between enjoying a good wine or whiskey or whatever (something that is considered kind of sophisticated by some people) and making a fool of yourself or even being an alcoholic is fairly fuzzy.<p>The situation is not entirely different for a number of prescription drugs. Sometimes, the benefits of medicinal use are considered to outweigh the possibility of &quot;abuse&quot; (as is the case with codeine, oxycontine, ketamine, a number of benzodiazepines and so forth), sometimes the possibility of non-medicinal use kind of poisons the well (heroin, psychedelics).<p>Personally, I think it is time to rethink the public policies on drugs. Prohibition has been shown - repeatedly - not to work and to cause a number of problems. Lifting the restrictions on many mind-altering substances would also make it easier to evaluate their possible medicinal uses (and to actually put those substances to use if they are found to be beneficial). Also, it would allow society and politics to start viewing addiction and all the problems that go along with it as a health issue rather than a law enforcement issue. The only substantial difference between an alcoholic and a meth or heroin addict is that alcohol is legal and that alcoholism is - to a degree - tolerated (or ignored) by society.",1414067611

(eventually I got them; ubuntu 5.04 I think [Horny Hedgehog from memory])<p>When I received them I was pleased, everything worked.. well, not everything, but it sorta worked! I had a desktop environment and a command line and I felt a small sense of accomplishment because I&#x27;d navigated the strange menu&#x27;s safely <i>before anakonda or full-framebuffer installers</i><p>Because of the peer pressure I learned about how to do my bits, and I carried on.<p>Later in the year I found fedora, and Blue is a nicer colour than brown (I was young and fickle) but it was less user friendly, so I committed to learn that and get off the &quot;Noob Friendly&quot; Ubuntu OS.<p>Many years later I got a small laptop for my mother, at this stage in my life I was &quot;awoken&quot; and I knew the power a machine could hold if it ran linux, so I put ubuntu on it- She&#x27;s not the most technically apt lady in the world but was able to do most things with ease, and I put that down to having a &quot;Good UX outside microsoft&quot; (since most people who learn the microsoft way are generally committed to a mindset and anything outside of that is pushed away).<p>A few issues with Flash, some performance hiccups on some websites that seemed to try and avoid supporting linux in strange ways (that I take for granted I know how to bypass) and eventually the machine gave up the ghost.<p>I bought a new machine and put ubuntu on it (13.10 I think) and she was somewhat less than pleased, the UX had changed, she didn&#x27;t know what was available anymore, nothing was organised in a way she understood.. and so I installed mint, she&#x27;s now happy.<p>So I&#x27;ll say this for Ubuntu, they put linux in the hands of people who we should really be targetting, it allowed me access to linux acting as a base plate and later acting as a full blown system for someone who was not interested at all in computers.

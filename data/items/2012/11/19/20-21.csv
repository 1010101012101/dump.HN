Plus, in my experience, clients who want to bargain on your compensation are already devaluing what you do. I had a client who complained about my rate, and wanted to cut it substantially, because ""there were lots of kids around who would work for less."" I responded by telling him that he should hire one of those kids, and I would gladly hand his project over to them. I guess he reconsidered, because that was the last I ever heard about lowering my rate. I still work for that client, and have actually raised my rate by 50% over the last few years.<p>Don't undersell yourself!",1353358770

4806334,story,,,9,5,gradthrowaway,"Ask HN: How to find the right job as new graduate?",,"Obviously, the best way to find the right job is through your network. But what about when you're first starting out and your network is small, largely still in college and mostly ineffective?<p>Among the classmates that I've talked to  at least among the ones who view it as more than ""just a job""  it's a frustrating experience. If you look at job boards, most of them are either asking for an entry level .NET developer with 3 years of experience with UML modeling, which sounds like a terrible fit, or they want a senior engineer.<p>One friend got hired at a megacorp in Seattle and is trying to lure me in that direction, but as someone who doesn't live in Seattle, NY or the Bay Area and likes where he lives, that reduces the number of attractive megacorps that I know of to zero. Don't get me wrong, I live in one of the major tech centers of the U.S., just not one of those three.<p>When I was looking for internships, I had very occasional luck just sending out random emails to attractive companies, but the hard part is finding those attractive companies. In the end, I ended up taking something that wasn't right for me because I had to support myself through college. (It's also a big part of the reason I'm a month from graduating and don't have any significant side projects to show.)<p>What if I want to hack JS/Ruby/Python instead of translate UML to Java and .NET? Is it unrealistic to find something along those lines if the vast majority of my experience is Java and C? Is a recruiter the right answer, or should I just suck it up for 6 months or so while I get some personal projects under my belt in the technologies I want to use? Do I need to be more open to relocation?",1353358637

4806332,comment,4805516,4805646,5,0,MaxGabriel,,,"I haven't used the buildpack, but based on working with Parse and watching the screencast, here are some guesses:<p>1) Parse is more full-featured. Parse includes significant automatic support for things like modeling users, comes with UI components for e.g. sign up, and includes e.g. a UITableViewController subclass to automatically support things like automatic paging.<p>2) While Parse's documentation is superb, these features come at the cost of flexibility (though you don't have to use all of them, of course -- it could just be a REST backend if you wanted it to be, like the heroku buildpack seen here). You'll tie your iOS app to Parse with PFObjects, whereas you're much more flexible with a backend agnostic approach that you'll get just using a REST web service.<p>3) The Heroku buildpack will probably tie better to CoreData. There might be a clean approach for this with Parse (when I used it I was pretty new to iOS) but I ended up having PFObject and Core Data representations of objects, which is rather clunky. Conversely, if you aren't using Core Data, this build pack wouldn't be helpful for you.<p>Some conclusions: 1) people who are learning to write iOS apps and don't have experience writing a web server should probably use Parse because it will be easier. It is my suspicion, as a few others have commented, that you will run into problems like ""Oh, how should I deal with user accounts and passwords"" that Parse will handle, but you'll have to figure out if using the buildpack. The buildpack comes with all the advantages you'd associate with Heroku -- other people know what those are better than me.<p>Let me also say that Mattt Thompson is an inspiration (check out his github and NSHipster.com, which are fantastic and foreshadowed this project) and I predict this buildpack will be as awesome as he can make it.",1353358618

It may seem obvious to many, but I think it bears stating.<p>If you are looking for consulting contracts that pay really well, focus on providing a service that helps companies make money rather than save money.   In other words, help grow revenues rather than reduce expenses  people pay much more for that.<p>Heres the reasoning:  When business managers, executives, etc. are given targets, they typically relate to increasing revenues much more often than reducing expenses.  Not surprisingly, increasing revenues is therefore front of mind for those with budgets to make it happen, and they see tremendous value in someone who can help them do that.  The fact that a little automation in the accounting system will save a data entry clerk a few hours a month  hmmm...maybe next month.<p>Case in point - I remember reading a comment somewhere from a Google employee who was complaining that at Google, those working on the revenue generation side of the business (i.e. advertising, adwords, etc.) got all the love and attention in terms of getting the resources required to get their job done, while others working on more obscure projects had to put up with leftovers.  Now Im not sure if that is actually true at Google, but I wouldn't be surprised as I've seen it at many other companies  the rain makers are the darlings with dollars to spend, and the back office ops folks are left to struggle with fewer resources.  All injustices aside, find a way to provide something to the rain makers.<p>The type of work that Patrick does directly improves revenues. If you are a DBA selling tuning services to help companies re-write gnarly queries for example, well, unless a slow performing query/process is directly impacting revenues in some way, it likely is a secondary priority in devops/support where budgets are tight and learn to live with it is becoming a way of life.",1353357294

It exists solely for Microsoft's benefit, because they want to move in that direction.  I also would bet money that it's going to get harder and harder to live in a non-Metro world over the next couple years (if, that is, you are still using Windows).<p>I recall my Dad asking me if I was looking forward to getting Vista (back before it was revealed to be the train-wreck it was) and I replied that I wasn't.  It simply had nothing I cared about.  Windows 7 was the same way.  Its improvements over XP are, IMO, few and of little impact.  I do not find its performance to be consistently better than XP and its interface most definitely is inferior (but ""Classic Shell"" fixes that).<p>The only thing I've seen from Microsoft that was even remotely interesting in the last 10 years was Kinect, and I don't play the kind of games it's good for.  Call me a hater, but MS simply doesn't have anything to offer me.<p>And like many people, if it weren't for games and a small handful of apps that I could live without if I really had to, I would run Linux on all my machines.  However... Steam is coming to Linux and a good number of GOG games run in Wine, so soon there may literally be no reason for me to use Windows (at least when not at work).<p>Maybe it's the economic reality that Microsoft simply doesn't care about experts who have been using computers for 30 years because there are so few of us.  We power users, experts, software developers and others may smugly abandon Microsoft because we think they aren't worth using any more, but Microsoft may simply think, ""Good riddance, we don't need you any more.""<p>I don't read what most people read, or listen to what most people listen to or watch what most people watch, so I'm used to it and that works for me.<p>But it's a little different with Microsoft, because they are still a very effective monopoly in some ways (e.g., Office) and even if you have no personal use for them, you can't completely escape Microsoft yet.<p>You've also got a good point, jsz0.  Microsoft has completely forgotten how to compete.  They are so used to forcing whatever they want on people and having them accept it because they have no choice.  If they want to enter a new market, they used to just overwhelm the competition with their massive resources, and there wasn't much competitors could do.  But it's not like that any more.  They are behind the curve and falling further behind with every month.  And as long as Mr. Too-Many-Y-Chromosomes is in charge, it seems unlikely to me that will change any time soon.",1353357215

You do a back-of-the-envelop calculation ignoring all the political wrangling, the on-again, off-again political support, the inevitable development setbacks, etc.  In other words, you ignore the cost drivers of every single other space program in history and come up with a number that's an order of magnitude (at least) too low.  If you actually got political approval for such a thing taxpayers would (justly) feel hoodwinked as program costs spiral upwards.  It would be lucky to survive to completion.<p>Based on other big government projects (like the F-22, for instance), the $1T figure is probably a little on the low side.  The idea you could send people to Mars and bring them back for $50Bn, less than it costs to build a HSR line from LA to San Francisco, is sheer stupidity.",1353356964

The Asus tablet I work with here at work is slower, in response to user actions at least, than any iOS device I've ever used.<p><i>4) Microsoft's autocorrection and keyboard layouts</i><p>Yes, the winrt touch keyboard is very nice. The best typing score I've ever achieved was on an old LG phone running windows phone 7. The suggestions ribbon that winrt copied from Android is fantastic - Apple needs to license this from Google.<p><i>The scenario is like this: used to be that computers were big things that sat on desks. Used to be you kept all your files on one PC and moving them from PC to PC was difficult. Used to be that not everybody used computers. Used to be that the internet was a niche part of computer use. Used to be that no one had persistent online social networks integrated into their lives. Used to be that tablets weren't prevalent. Etc etc. Then all of these things changed - and now the world's most popular OS is changing in response to these changes. These are all technical problems (or whatever you want to call them) and W8 is an attempt to begin solving these problems.</i><p>No, it really isn't. W8 is an attempt to deal with what Microsoft believes is the existential threat of iOS and Android. I'm not going to argue the merits of Metro itself the way the article seems to because I like the Swiss design principles that seem to have guided the development of Metro and because I think Metro has generally been a technical success with windows phone 7 and would do at least as well on a tablet.<p>Metro on the desktop makes sense if you believe in the fairy-tale of tablet-PC convergence. I don't think that even Microsoft is foolish enough to believe this, which is why I think this is a cynical move to metastasize Windows and devour  tablets the way Microsoft tried to devour PDAs with PocketPC. The Start Menu didn't belong in a PDA interface 15 years ago, and Metro doesn't belong on the desktop today. Tablet-PC device convergence would make sense if tablet-PC device <i>use</i> convergence made sense. Just the contradictory technical constraints on these two classes of devices - CPU/GPU power and precise UI control vs mobility and long battery life - tell us we shouldn't expect tablets and PCs to converge.<p>This isn't innovation - its the crude simulacrum of innovation. It doesn't make desktop PCs any better - if MS was interested in that, they'd bring proven fixes like pervasive desktop search (or at least a promoted UI element for the existing desktop search) or tiled window management to W8 - not Metro. Both of those features actually make desktop users on other platforms (and on Windows with 3rd party add-ons) more productive, <i>right now</i>.<p><i>Second: at the end of the day, the best marketing move Microsoft can make is to build great products that take advantage of all the possibilities of modern technology. I still argue that, after a period of relative stagnation, computer interfaces are starting to respond to the massive changes in computing technology and culture. Windows 8, whether it is particularly well-executed or not, whether it fits well with the legacy desktop or not, whether it breaks some parts of the desktop work environment PC model or not, is a step in that direction - the right direction.</i><p>It's not the right direction. At all. This is what kept tablets out of most users hands for so long - the notion that Tablet UIs should be similar to PC UIs. Remember Windows tablet PCs? Both of these classes of devices should be allowed to evolve in their own directions rather than being crudely stitched together to satisfy a wrong-headed convergence fetish. Apple probably knows this better than any other company at this point, given the backlash over tablet-esque features that were added to Lion. One would hope that Microsoft could learn from Apple's experience. Maybe like small children, this is something Microsoft has to learn for themselves through their own mistakes.",1353356433

From the beginning:<p>* <i>Jeff however, I truly believe, thinks that I sent the photos to his wife. If I had done so, then I would deserve whatever wrath he chose to mete out. But seriously, its not my style. And if his mistaken suspicion is not the reason for his bulldog approach to sniffing out my life then I cant even guess at what twisted motives move this man.</i><p>* Wired asked him to pose shirtless with a shotgun. This apart from all the other shirtless photos of him, and him with young coeds; did Wired stage those? Did Wired also stage McAfee playing Russian Roulette with a loaded trick revolver in front of Josh Davis?<p>* <i>I laid down the pistol that I keep for protection and, contrary to Josh Davis assertion that I said Motherfuckers, said nothing and went back inside.  I woke Amy, the 17 year old with whom I was living, and calmly told her to get dressed  that the GSU was invading the property.</i><p>* The entire ""Samantha"" post, which reads just like the ""secret diary of John McAfee"" from Gizmodo, which in turn consists of profiles of the various young Belizeans McAfee has slept with, followed by a few sentences about the paramilitary groups seeking to kill him. (My favorite part of all these bits of writing, including the ""Samantha"" piece, are the photos, which make it seem like the most important thing McAfee has to convince us of is that these young women <i>are real</i> --- like that makes him seem saner)<p>* <i>First there was an attempt to charge me with running an antibiotics laboratory without a license. In Belize a special government permit is required to research antibiotics  a law which is common in Third World countries. To date, no such permits have ever been issued. I suspect the large drug conglomerates have much to do with these widespread laws, or perhaps its a viewpoint motivated by my latent paranoia. In any case, I didnt have such a permit. Neither was I researching or producing antibiotics. Antibiotics are taken systemically. I was working on a topical antibacterial spray. It could in no way be classified as an antibiotic.</i> (Here it helps to note that McAfee's original research scientist partner in the antibiotic effort had to flee Belize in fear of McAfee)<p>* The ""Punishment of the Innocent"" post where careful mention is made of which people do not drink or do drugs.<p>* The entire ""Watchfulness"" post, which posits a shoe-polish-painted John McAfee watching the Belizean paramilitary GSU police digging up the corpses of his dogs, removing their heads, and leaving the bodies. <i>The dogs had been dead too long for an effective autopsy, considering it would be performed in a Third World country with limited access to laboratory resources. What was this all about?</i> Well, John, isn't it clear? ZOMBIE DOGS.",1353356269

Which is nice, I've got a Zigbee development board from Atmel that I'm planning on using to see if I can talk to the bulbs directly.<p>So interestingly they are 8.5W and about 600 lumens. I pulled out a compact florescent which was 23W and 1200 lumens, So in theory I could use a '2:1' bulb socket and get my 1200 Lumens with less power, or make up a 3:1 fixture and get 1800 lumens for the same amount of power.

Developers think that proposition decreases risk.  Business owners think <i>exactly the opposite</i>.  It suggests that there's such significant project risk associated with employing you that the market forces you to self-indemnify for that risk upfront, which <i>virtually no other service provider they use does</i>.  (Separate from what your client thinks of it, it also puts your paycheck at the mercy of clients' ability to e.g. follow through on your recommendations.  Clients generally <i>earn</i> the results they get from working with outside consultants, just like they earn the results they get from working with their own employees.  The ones who do everything in their power to make engagements a success tend to do better than ones who... don't.  You probably still want to get paid when they... don't.)<p>I'm not totally opposed to some sort of variable payout mechanic to pricing, but the vast majority of my engagements are structured ""I work X weeks at $Y per week.""  By the time I've sold you on the engagement, I should have been able to sell you on X<i></i>$Y being an acceptable price to pay for the risk-discounted probability space of all possible outcomes to the engagement.  (n.b. If you do variable payouts for anything, you need to figure out how to transfer a large percentage of the upside from the client to you for the math to work out.)<p>If I personally was selling you an engagement, and you said ""What happens if this doesn't lead to an improvement in the business?"", the very next words out of my mouth will be ""It is <i>entirely possible</i> that this engagement will not lead to an improvement in the business.  The vast of my engagements have been successes.  Some of them, like the ones we talked about earlier, were incredible successes.  Let's talk about ways we can be more likely to make this engagement successful.  If you do not believe that this engagement is likely to be successful, we will not do this engagement.""  (I'd also independently decline an engagement where I thought it wasn't likely to be a win or would meaningfully damage the business in event of a failure.  I typically work for companies with revenues in the eight figure range -- if they set fire to my entire paycheck, nobody goes home hungry.)<p>As to what you personally could offer for risk reducers, absent a history of doing exactly this thing before, I might suggest reaching back into your portfolio of other things you have done and showing off ones which demonstrated likelihood of success.  In my first few consulting engagements, my main portfolio piece was ""similar work which I did for my own business worked out well, as evidenced by a few years of blog posts; here's a few I like.""  After the first few engagements, well, BCC was no longer the most credible piece of evidence I could point to.",1353356110

When I was young and stupid, I thought myself extremely clever for seeing instances of reverse racism, but this was because I understood nothing about racism except that MLK Jr. gave this nice speech a long time ago and now bad things no longer happened. I thought it was this magical thing where there were black people and there were white people and I was yellow except not really so it was kinda weird and I didn't understand why the red people didn't seem very red.<p>Then I grew up and started understanding how power moves and manifests. It's very fuzzy. You don't see mathematical equations about how the election of the POTUS changes opinion in the Middle East, because we haven't figured out how to model that. Our understanding of power is extremely weak, compared to something like how many atoms of hydrogen are found in a molecule of water. To make this extremely stark, <i>we don't understand power</i>. We have a feel. An intuitive notion. That is all we have.<p>We do not have explicit forms of racial discrimination to any significant degree. But we do still have significant power imbalances that map suspiciously well to racial divides. These power imbalances are virtually impossible to quantify, because we have no idea how to do it, but we can infer them from statistical trends. We've chosen to call this racism.<p>That's language drift for you. There are reasons not to call it racism. Apologists, such as yourself, have enumerated a good number of them for us. But there are also good reasons to call it racism. First among these is that we do not <i>need</i> the more generic definition any longer. English speakers generally have difficulty finding instances of chattel slavery or explicit segregation laws. In both of these cases, we have more specific terms anyways. Second is that it signals the correct emotional reaction. Most people are offended when called a racist, because they've been trained to understand it is a bad thing to be. Used properly, it forms a foundation to change behavior. (And before you say that it is sometimes used improperly, this would be true of a different term as well; but a different term would not have the same, useful emotional charge.) Third is that the issue remains one of ""dividing people into groups called races which contain people with identifiably similar traits"". The generic definition still actually applies, but it does so more weakly.<p>I'm sure you take issue with all of these, but really? The definition could be improved. That doesn't make it meaningless, as demonstrated by the many people who use it in that capacity without a problem. It <i>does</i> make it difficult, as demonstrated by the many people who seem incapable of understanding it.<p>(Also, loleconomics.)",1353355617

Here's what I've done so far..<p>- Reach out to your existing network - if you have friends who have done freelancing / consulting, find out what companies they did freelancing / consulting for - chances are those companies still need it.<p>- Offer to meet for coffee / lunch / dinner. I'm based in the UK and was trying via e-mail to speak to a potential client. It just wasn't happening. They are based in the US. So I called them up and offered to meet for dinner there at a time convenient for them - they accepted and I had the dinner last week. It is very easy for someone to decline a phone call / conference call. It's much harder for someone to do that when they know you have made an effort to turn up in person - they also have to eat so meal times work good.<p>- I find being honest is the best route to go. They expect you to know what you're doing! I think it's fine to say - I've just stepped out of employment and now I'm looking to build a business myself in what I've been doing - people respect you for trying to start a business!<p>- Don't offer to do something for free too early on. The person you're pitching to is not working for free and they won't be expecting you to work for frre either? Yes, you may need to offer something for free to land a client initially - but do not do it with open-ended development!! Instead suggest you do an analysis of their system etc and write up a report and how you'd improve things - at least that has a fixed scope. Or ask for a dataset and show simply how you can use that data to give them some new numbers they don't yet have.",1353355484

I read somewhere that in Japan, corporations are expected to take care of the employees in an almost familial sense, and in return, employees are expected to give their life energy to the corporation. I would be willing to wager that employee turnover in Japanese companies is lower than in the United States, and that quitting and working for a competitor for a higher salary would be seen as betrayal.<p>If this is the case, perhaps having a Megacorp job in Japan makes an employee feel protected and safe in a way that doesn't exist (any more) in US Megacorp jobs. I recall in 2008, Toyota bragged about not closing factories or laying people off, and saying how they care about their employees.

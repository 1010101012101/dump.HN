623373,comment,622574,623287,0,0,rbanffy,,,"""I'm pretty sure Microsoft themselves having contributed to mono projects would invalidate any such lawsuit""<p>No. It wouldn't. And, most of all, it has no effect on where they take .NET in the future. If they decide to break Mono by moving the reference platform and to make Mono developers run in circles, they can. If they decide to sue _users_ of Mono programs, they pretty much can, unless at least a significant part of the code being used is licensed in a patent-litigation-proof license, which, I gather, is not the case.<p>The whole case is that you just have to trust Microsoft to, for the first time in its history, act in a civilized way. You may judge it's an acceptable risk for you and your users, but I just don't think that way.",1243079868

623369,comment,620896,621517,0,0,bitdiddle,,,"This was a great book. The story about the taxi cab number 1729 was staggering to me in what it implied about how Ramanujan's mind worked. It was also profoundly sad that because the little formal exposure he had was from a book where there were no proofs he thought that one merely stated results. Many PhDs have since been awarded for proofs of some of these results.",1243079190

623364,comment,620896,621898,0,0,bitdiddle,,,"yes it is jokingly said. The book cited above (The man who knew only numbers"") is a great read. It has a picture of Erdos with Aaron receiving honorary degrees.<p>I studied graph theory for a year at MSU with Edgar Palmer in 1981. At the time the proof of the four color conjecture, which was very controversial because it used a computer program (egads!!) was making the rounds. Palmer related many interesting stories about Erdos and also had us work on some of the problems for which Erdos had offered rewards.",1243078727

I wonder if you could verify for me whether the ""French-Alice"" voice on that site pronounces this name correctly (please):<p><i>Antoine de Saint Exupéry</i><p>I've always been curious how it's said, but whenever I run into native french speakers, I forget to ask. I found that site a while back, but I can't judge how accurate it is. Many thanks!",1243078338

As said in other comments, equivalent expressions exist in Spanish, Italian or German, where they are frequently used.<p>Conversely, I find interesting that very common expressions in the english language, like ""procrastination"", are almost unknown in Europe (saved the UK and IE). Spanish, for example, has the perfectly correct term ""procrastinación"", but it's very seldom used.",1243078304

It was awesome. Ritalin showed me what it was like to be ""normal"". I took it for about a year and, for me, once I had seen ""normal"", I was able to just settle down. I still hyperfocused and was fidgety but I was able to recognize those times whereas, before Ritalin, I had not known that what I was doing was odd/different/good/bad.",1243077075

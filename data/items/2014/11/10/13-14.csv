I have found them to have virtually zero correlation with good hires.  So if I get a CV with frequent switching on it, and the candidate is great in all the other pipeline, it probably won&#x27;t matter at all.  If on the other hand, there are other questions about the candidate, a frequent switcher will get some questions about what they want in a job and a little bit of skepticism if we think there will be a big ramp up cost.",1415627996

8583490,comment,8580171,8582403,0,0,calinet6,,,"This I agree with completely, but you must recognize the need for a stepping stone when speaking to people who are otherwise totally ignorant of Zen, and also the fact that with this set of ideas, surely it is not a maximization effort: even a moderate comprehension of Zen is better than nothing. Some would say that this does not exist, but I have personally experienced great benefit from the way of thinking if not fully the way of life, and I know others have a chance to as well.<p>In other terms, it is very difficult to sell a way of life, but people readily accept one small idea in that direction. I very much respect what you have written and know it to be true, but I also believe that the intellectual part of zen, while surely not complete at all, has so many useful and real benefits that it can&#x27;t be ignored, and it makes a fine introduction. Whatever the destination, the western mind needs some convincing.<p>However, I have taken to heart what you have said and I will further my learning by going and doing.<p><i>Edit:</i> After some thought, I do want to re-iterate that I think there are two realizations (not close to enlightenment, or to Zen, per se, but related) that I think are relevant to this discussion: that reality is paradoxical, and that one of those paradoxes is that often effort in a certain direction is inversely proportional to success. We often find what we&#x27;re looking for when we&#x27;re not looking for it, and we often hit the target when we&#x27;re least trying to.<p>The major realization is that these are not just silly anecdotes or trivialities, but a core part of life itself and what it means to be human. They are very important, and the original article shows a manifestation of those ideas in a very clear and human way without identifying them exactly.",1415627967

When I&#x27;m not shopping at a neighborhood store, I go to the local market. Each of these places are very bland. Basically just a bamboo or concrete house with the products hanging or stacked up in shelves. Often you just order through a barred window and they give you what you ask for. After shopping like this for months, walking into a regular grocery store is an assault on the senses. Packaging, marketing and colors everywhere. Things at the smaller stores are also really cheap because the locals have to be able to afford them. At the larger grocery stores I&#x27;m floored by the prices of everything. I avoid grocery stores as much as possible.<p>The selection of products here is slim. I can spend all day looking around different stores and not find one thing on my wishlist. Otherwise I find nothing interesting. Many products are cheap and low quality because expensive items don&#x27;t sell. I&#x27;m happy living here and I have the things I really need.<p>Happy + have everything I really need + have money + nothing to spend money on = abundance of sorts. I don&#x27;t know if I feel rich, but it&#x27;s strange feeling like money doesn&#x27;t really do me much good. Daily expenses are super cheap. I only have going out to eat to spend money on. My favorite meals only cost $1 - $3. When everything is cheap, an expensive meal seems excessive.<p>Further screwing with me is that I can help out with simple tech stuff at these restaurants and I can eat for free. Business owners here don&#x27;t know how to use things like Facebook, which is basically the internet for the Philippines. It&#x27;s not really worth my time, but I like to help.

So it goes beyond simple text editing.  Of course, I believe it has been ported to other text editors. At least I know there is a port for Sublime Text, but it&#x27;s incomplete and much less capable. Vim probably has a port too, but then if you end up customizing Vim, you might want to take a look at Emacs :-)<p>CTags is a pain, since you have to reindex your files periodically and it doesn&#x27;t work well for other people&#x27;s libraries. In IntelliJ IDEA it simply works, you can just click on a class / function definition and if it doesn&#x27;t have the sources available for that JAR (say it&#x27;s a library you depend on), it downloads those sources automatically and takes you to the definition. For Emacs it works if you have the right plugin installed - works for Clojure and for Scala / Java for example (though for Scala / Java, we are talking about an Eclipse-based engine running in the background :))<p>I do get the mentality of Vim users, I&#x27;ve been there and I even use Vim sometimes, but depending on the problems you&#x27;re working on and the platform you&#x27;re using, I lean towards the IDE approach nowadays.

The A+ likely has lower power consumption than the Beaglebone (but also only 256 MB RAM, which is really going to be limiting for many tasks).

8583414,comment,8580124,8580124,0,0,jarcane,,,"I think the fundamental problem with teaching code is that teaching code is not math, it&#x27;s language, and language is quickly internalized once you &#x27;get&#x27; it.<p>Most of the people who write books and web tutorials teaching code already know the code, but don&#x27;t realize the extent to which they&#x27;ve internalized a large amount of understanding of the subject. So what makes perfect sense to them either gets dropped on the table without explanation, or struggles to actually give a clear <i>why</i> of the thing. Being able to recognize that, and explain those things clearly, is a very specific skill in programming just as it is in language, and just as sometimes language classes get given to someone who just happens to speak the language rather than who is a linguist, you will often find someone who speaks, say, Java or C++, but can&#x27;t necessarily explain clearly <i>why</i> or <i>how</i> the patterns and techniques they&#x27;ve internalized work.<p>I&#x27;m increasingly a believer in more interactive methods of code teaching, because I think like language it&#x27;s a subject that requires immediate practice to facilitate that internalization. Exercises like the Codecademy courses, or the Koans, which pair explanation with specific examples, immediate practice with new concepts, and equally immediate feedback about failures/successes, do a far better job of teaching a language than anything else I have seen.",1415627026

These parameters are stored in the iPhone 6&#x27;s secure element, and allow the iPhone to perform full EMV transactions.<p>One difference between these parameters and those provisioned to a physical ICC on a new debit/credit card, is that the card number (PAN) is not used; instead a payment token is used (it <i>looks</i> like a PAN - it has the same number of digits, etc).

When turning off all animations in Windows, the system feels so much more responsive and doesn&#x27;t hold me back in well-trained workflows.<p>With Android 4, the default state is really bad. Fortunately, you can turn off most animations in the dev settings, but still, it feels like the OS wasn&#x27;t optimized for low latency (especially when switching apps). I hope that Android 5 will still allow for animations to be turned off. I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m very eager to try Android 5.<p>Worst thing is, even with the reasonably powerful Nexus 4 (and I hear the same is true even about the Nexus 9), under a little bit of load, animations tend to become even more sluggish; inaccurate animations let the user make mistakes. I have noticed that it is nearly impossible for me to quickly check something using the Nexus 4 while waiting at the lights, especially if it involves switching apps (go from navigation to messaging etc. and back), the phone just isn&#x27;t responsive enough.

The policeman was being relayed that the perpetrator had been already arrested by a colleague down the street (after CCTV identified him), the officer with us knew it was an unprovoked attack as the CCTV operator saw at no point did we interact with the assailant, so treated us with respect and started explaining the options for prosecution.<p>I appreciate the flip side of the coin but personally now feel much safer when in an area with CCTV.",1415625845

Otherwise, (the following is based on my experience in the US, YMMV, etc), if they&#x27;re not a software company, or are a defense contractor or similar, probably safest to go with a suit. If they are a software company, business casual is probably fine. If they&#x27;re a startup, jeans and a t-shirt is probably fine. If you&#x27;re uncertain, consider dressing up slightly; i.e., you think jeans and a t-shirt is fine but aren&#x27;t sure; go with khakis and a polo. You think business casual is okay but aren&#x27;t sure, go with a dress shirt and slacks.<p>In general the commentary along the lines of &quot;would you want to work there if they judged you on your clothes?&quot; is probably true, however it misses a major point. In many roles, roles you may even enjoy, you will interact with executives or with customers, at some level. Even if that doesn&#x27;t entail dressing up (and oftentimes it won&#x27;t), being able to show that you can exude professionalism during the interview shows that you can do it in such a situation, and it&#x27;s generally easier to do that when dressed nicely (though balance it against the discomfort of wearing something you&#x27;re unaccustomed to).",1415624786

1081065,comment,1080272,1080591,0,0,Retric,,,"I know lot’s of really dumb geeks that are into sci-fi because they can’t function in society.  I also know several highly intelligent people who simply don’t want to function in society and happen to like sci-fi.  It can be difficult for outsiders to separate these groups, especially because the less intelligent geeks try and mask their faults.  It's something like the Bulb problem where it's hard to tell if someone is actually highly intelligent or just acts differently than you do.<p>There is still a shared context among the geek community.  I think Equilibrium was the most emotionally moving movie I have ever seen yet I have little interest in seeing it again, others just like the gun play and will watch it constantly.  But, such distinctions are only relevant once you have seen the movie.  Stepping back a few years and Blade Runner has the same dichotomy of people who like and or obsess over the movie and those who simply reacted strongly to it.  (Now add Dune, Enders Game, Stranger in a Strange Land, etc.)<p>PS: The number of times you have seen each of the Star Wars films is probably a good metric for this.  (Not to insult Star Wars.)",1264615174

1081055,comment,1080672,1080805,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"The price issue, I think, is key. No one has mentioned, as far as I know, that since the device is designed to be always-connected, it could be bundled with a mobile contract (albeit a data-only plan), just like an iPhone, and thus heavily subsidized by the carrier. While most of us know that a two year contract is a really expensive way to get $300 knocked of the price of a phone, it does allow for really amazing devices to have really amazing looking prices, like $200 for the iPhone or $180 for the Nexus One. I suspect the tablet could see a similar subsidized price (and similar lock-in to a single carrier that made a deal with Apple, hoping for a knock out hit like the iPhone has been for AT&T; they'll be disappointed, but the deal probably could have been made).",1264615013

1081050,comment,1080553,1080958,0,0,mikepurvis,,,"""The problem is more likely with prevailing conventions in certain open-source CMS design, than with a particular CMS.""<p>This is my understanding of the issue. I had some experience with Joomla back when it was Mambo, and my impression was that a huge number of the tables represented metadata and configuration of various kinds. It seemed like there was an almost fetish-like desire for everything to be configurable from a web UI, and a very heavy price was paid for this flexibility in the backend.<p>Compare this with a product like PunBB, where it is much more opinionated, and some aspects of the configuration can only be altered by editing key source files. For example, to add or remove emoticons from the bulletin board or edit the curse-word replacement list, you have to edit an array in a file somewhere.<p>Which may seem like a pain, but the end result is that you save on a big complicated admin screen that will only get used once or twice per installation, and for every subsequent pageview, you're just pulling stuff in from a file rather than a DB table.",1264614850

If you can't predict that need then it's generally more convenient to purchase. And that's the key term: <i>convenience</i>.

But that's not the case with the consumer items they're talking about here.<p>Businesses will often lean towards leasing instead of purchasing because one is normally paid from the Operations budget and the other from the Capital budget.

Once you reach the point where no-one has non-trivial insight into everything that is going on, this becomes very difficult, no matter how carefully you plan your corporate communications and how sincere the management structure.<p>A common, and reasonable-sounding, approach to fixing problem areas is to create some sort of ""focus group"" or ""core team"" (or bring in an external consultancy) who can take the time to do what the rest of the staff can't do without disrupting their regular jobs: go talk to people at all levels through the organisation, gather the key points about what is happening and what the staff feel about it, summarise what is <i>actually happening</i> for management, and possibly advise on how to improve the situation based on what has worked elsewhere.<p>The difficulty with this approach is that in most organisations, there will be a grass-roots resistance/resentment of any changes that such a working group proposes, because people don't like to be told how to do their jobs, even if they are doing them badly and don't necessarily realise it. You have to have honest, full-on backing right down the management structure to pull this off, and you need to get the ""good"" people on your side first so that when others challenge the changes the people they know personally and respect will shape their views. This is possible, but IME only if senior management are willing to deal brutally with any middle management interference runners, which they seldom are. (Edit: Also, anyone seconded to the working group needs to have both an open mind themselves and the respect of the management team in whatever part of the organisation they represent. Otherwise, they will just disrupt the group, or they'll talk a lot and come up with good ideas to which no-one will then listen.)<p>Those who get to run big businesses and have snazzy MBAs and such are supposed to understand these issues and get them right, but it's sad how often they don't.",1264613784

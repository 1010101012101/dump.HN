Everything was extremely rigorous but nothing was going to go beyond a certain theoretical level.<p>It indeed seemed unique in the sense of producing the most noticeably uniform group of students I saw in my different campus visits. It seemed like they did make a nod to English by having some breadth requirements and so it seemed it would actually have been <i>even harder</i> for a Caltech graduate to take <i>theoretical perspective</i> within an engineering field than it would have been for them to appreciate a sonnet on their off-hours.",1294693193

2089717,comment,2089141,2089141,0,0,carpdiem,,,"I went to Caltech recently, and I feel I should weigh in on this.<p>The author of the article spends an unfortunate amount of time talking about SAT and AP scores, as if that's all that Tech cares about. Having served on an institute committee to decide the direction of the Admissions office, I can assure you that this simply isn't true. Caltech's sky-high SAT and AP scores aren't an end in and of themselves, they're simply a side-effect. Caltech looks, more than anything else, for a demonstrated passion for math and science. Near-perfect SAT and AP scores are just a check box on the way to demonstrating a true passion and ability for math and science.<p>And that's really key, because a perfect GPA, SAT & AP scores, and great teacher recommendations isn't enough to get in. There has to be something more. Usually that 'something more' is independent work in a research lab, science competition, personal projects, or somesuch, and so the incoming class at Caltech is never just people who know how to get good grades and do nothing else, but a crowd of voracious achievers, many of whom have spent their lives figuring out how to push themselves harder and faster towards their passions than allotted for by whatever system they were raised in. To characterize them otherwise is a mistake.",1294693174

It can't (based on my understanding) realize that ""this block is <i>almost</i> the same as this block"" and shift things accordingly, because then it would be messing with application data that might be corrupted by the changes.<p>If the application is making those shifts on the other hand, it would work just fine because the application could be smart enough to shuffle and unshuffle things in the most efficient way it knows how, but the file system doesn't have the luxury.<p>If I'm still missing something, please let me know.

2089698,comment,2089141,2089507,0,0,jessriedel,,,"> The article is biased and full of negative stereotypes and a thinly veiled attack at ... dare I say, racial, ethnic and sexual minorities themselves.<p>Could you give an example of how this author could have criticized the practice of affirmative action <i>without</i> attacking racial, ethnic and sexual minorities themselves?  I agree that the author clearly has an axe to grind, but I see <i>nothing</i> in the text which attacks a minority.  Honestly, it seems like you're accusing him of racism based <i>only</i> off the fact that he opposes affirmative action.<p>ADDED:<p>>SAT scores or grades are hardly any measure of the 'smartness' of academic credibility of the student. For example, as a commenter above pointed out, in computer science, a person who has average grades but more research work and open source experience is probably more motivated to learn than a student with just good grades.<p>The author uses SAT scores because they are the best objective measure we have of academic quality.  Most other measures (GPA, high school research experience) are going to be strongly effected by where the student is from.  Nowhere does the author suggest that research experience shouldn't be considered.  And, in fact, using this measure would benefit the rich, white, and privileged students, as they are much more likely to have such research opportunities than poor minorities.<p>>Secondly, the data[1] proves even that though minority students who make it with affirmative action might graduate with average of below average scores but perform as well as their colleagues in their professional life.<p>The data as you describe only confirms that well-known fact that top-tier schools add negligible value to the professional prospect of its students.  That is, after controlling for SATs, familiy income, etc., future success doesn't depend on what school you attend.  (I can pull the study if you want.)  That data says <i>nothing</i> about the how lower admission standards for minorities impact the schools academics.  And, as you say, their grades are weak both in high school and college.<p>>Thirdly, contrary to what the author might want us to believe, the politically charged atmosphere in the Universities during the 70s was good for the society.<p>This isn't the main thesis of the article; the author is just giving you his perspective on where the situation originated.<p>>Why should a student who is obsessed with and excels at track-and-field be penalized for his obsession?<p>No one is suggesting that athlete's be <i>penalized</i>.  The author is arguing that they shouldn't receive the (massive) boost in admissions.",1294692740

The ""root weave"" image is designed to help you detect errors in display rendering. If there's something wrong in your display drivers, display settings, or even cable connections, the refresh makes the root weave look like it's moving and can show other very obvious signs of corruption.<p>I got into this function-over-fashion mindset many decades ago when it was very easy to destroy a very expensive display by configuring or driving it the wrong way. Modern displays typically have safe-guards to prevent destroying equipment, but my ancient habit is still very useful for debugging.<p>The X.org and XFree code base includes the rootweave and a few other similar images designed to help identify display problems.

While it's great that Caltech doesn't bend on its academic standards, it assumes that simple academic meritocracy on paper is all that is important to build a 'good' school. I go to MIT (where we have over 30 varsity NCAA teams, many of which are very successful), and the jocks have just as much academic merit to be here as the nerds who tool away in their dorm room. Same with the blacks, hispanics, legacies, minority x, minority y, etc etc. Not only that, MIT does an incredible job of putting together well-rounded people, and not at the expense of their intellectual capability. I have a friend who is high up in the undergraduate admissions committee and personality and fit are just as important as their academic merit. This means I don't go to the stereotyped MIT with a bunch of nerds who only study all day. Instead, I go to school with a diverse blend of incredible people who are athletes, musicians, and artists who are talented AND smart.<p>I guess if CalTech's mission is just to breed academic warriors that's fine, but this article's statements on MIT (I can only speak for my own school, but it probably applies to others as well) are ignorant and elitist.

Checking one name server through Pingdom is not giving you a detailed review of name servers.  You could have checked another name server in Dynect and they could of had twice as much downtime... but still Dynect was up.<p>Showing one name server is good, but it is not judging a providers ""downtime"".

It's a lot about revenues and net profits. There are lots of businessmen in charge who want to make lots of money quickly, and couldn't care less about the quality of the search results.<p>First of all, Google went public in 2004. I would like you to point me to a study showing the steady decline in quality since that time. Who are these 'lots of businessmen' you talk about? One of the complaints about Google has actually been that they prefer to have engineers in all sorts of roles including management.<p>Now, since you've gone all conspiracy theorist, I have a theory of my own, I hope you will excuse it. My theory is that the pro-Apple blogging community has gone ape-shit over a perceived threat to iOS from Google, and are now looking at them as 'The enemy', and this whole rash of blog posts maligning Google is part of a larger 'Death by a thousand paper cuts' strategy to make Google seem uncool, and therefore, as we all concur, dead. I also believe that said bloggers are in fact undercover employees of Apple who get paid by the number of times they mention Apple products in reviews of their competitors' products, but that's just me being nuts.",1294689836

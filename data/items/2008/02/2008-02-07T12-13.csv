Samsung and Motorola are always keen on being Linux consortiums. What's their Linux phones' market share in Europe?<p>I am not saying that Google will never make it. It will take time before they can grab a decent share. The name of the game is wait and see at the moment.",1202388876

I have been saved more than once because Lisp/Scheme have the way to tweak very low-level stuff within it so that I can tune the whole program to meet the performance requirements without changing the large structure of the program.  And don't take the Scheme guy's discussion about Elegance by their word---we know that tools of day-to-day jobs has to have a kind of dirtiness (I don't despise that; in fact, I rather like to play with lower bits, UI, or legacy workflow,...).

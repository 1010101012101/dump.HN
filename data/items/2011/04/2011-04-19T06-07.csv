2461831,comment,2461585,2461713,5,0,bdhe,,,"That's an excellent solution. A couple of points:<p>1. It is usually not a good idea to use your key as a function of the message. Here, you would require your hash function to have a good min-entropy given inputs from whatever distribution M comes from. I believe SHA-256, as of today, will satisfy these needs.<p>2. Even if H is modeled as a perfect hash function (i.e., a random oracle, in crypto literature) you would require that AES itself does not use H in any particular special way. Think of AES' which is just like AES except when k=h(m) for any message, it just outputs k (i.e., cheats). It would be nearly impossible to detect this behaviour of AES' under normal circumstances because H is pre-image resistant, but clearly, this would trivially void the security of the scheme.<p>The suggestion is exactly what came to my mind, but the proof, although should most definitely hold when instantiated with AES and SHA-256 will require some work to be proven in general.",1303194219

I've reviewed some of the best projects to come out of todays CS programs as assignments, and I can tell you that they are rote, unimaginative, and lack real-world application value.<p>* ""You have got to be kidding me. What you learn in school is not the idea itself but a method of thinking, method of critiquing and the method of learning. One of the most effective ways to learn to solve problems is to solve problems that already have solutions and to learn from those that came before you. Yes you may learn ""stuffs from the 70s"" but you are learning them for a reason. For example, just because NoSQL is in vogue right now doesn't mean that relation theory should be discarded. There is a value in going to school, being surrounded by a learning atmosphere, reassessing yourself every day and learning more about yourself."" *<p>I agree completely. Why so defensive? Huge loan payments due? You don't need to go to an ivy league school to learn ACID compliance, or relational theory (although relational application is more suitable for real world problems). You also don't need to go to school to ""find"" yourself, and to presume with such conviction that YOUR position is the correct one is just as asinine as if I were to presume mine was the only correct path.<p>Some of us are natural problem solvers, who absorb and process volumes of information quickly. Based on your frustration level, it's probably safe to assume you are not one of those, and there's nothing wrong with that.<p>But, ya know, you're right.. clearly there's only one way to go through life, and yours MUST be the correct way, or why else would people like you sink to name calling and belittling just because someone has a dissenting opinion?<p>* Seriously, you get to meet people who started fields, who wrote books, who first thought of the problems in CS schools. Computer Science is still in adolescence. You will still meet legends."" *<p>Seriously? You'd go to college to meet the guy who wrote Pong?, or the guy who wrote the first ray casting algorithm? Sounds like a rational fiscal decision. I'll bet Dad was paying the bill. I figured out long, long ago, while you were still a glint in your father's eye, that I can simply call those people up and buy them lunch, and they'll impart all their knowledge to me on demand.<p>* So?

With millions of users, careless words formed out of marketing needs are no longer needed. What Dropbox users need now is more clear picture of what they are giving up to gain Dropbox's services.<p>2. The weakest security link is the user and their computer, not Dropbox which has enough financial incentives at stake to be diligent security wise. In the end, no computer open to external data or code is safe. What protect most users today is actually not security technologies but cost/benefit ratio to potential attackers, tempered by goal and scale. 99.9999% of Dropbox user data is useless to attackers and cost of mining questionable nuggets out continually expanding sea of data from 20 million users is not a trivial task.<p>3.

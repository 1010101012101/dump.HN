6937396,comment,6933615,6936864,1,0,nhaehnle,,,"I agree that the physical use of gold does not explain its price by itself. Two things though: First of all, the physical use of gold is undeniable, and it&#x27;s plausible that a sort of &quot;bubble&quot; -- perhaps not quite the right term given how stable that bubble is -- bootstrapped from this physical value.<p>Second, from what I understand, the first gold coins that were intended as currency were made of gold precisely <i>because</i> gold was already valued for other reasons. I do know that historically speaking, the value of gold coins was usually unrelated to the price of their gold contents, so it is true that they played the role of an IOU. However, (a) there is a reason why governments chose gold rather than a different material (psychology based on the pre-existing value of gold), and (b) throughout the ages, gold was <i>also</i> used as a payment-commodity in trade.<p>That latter use is probably overstated by the goldbugs, but it would be wrong to dismiss it entirely.",1387483185

6937371,comment,6935784,6936977,2,0,jff,,,"> Also, GP is conflating the issues of (1) fetching dependencies, (2) building a project, (3) installing the project. Makefiles aren&#x27;t inherently evidence against &quot;go get&quot;; there is no reason that &quot;go get&quot; couldn&#x27;t call &quot;make&quot; instead of &quot;go build&quot; (which it does).<p>Go get conflates those issues. It fetches dependencies, builds the project, and installs it.<p>You don&#x27;t need Makefiles, you&#x27;re right. You need a script that sets GOPATH and calls &quot;go build&quot;.<p>The most important thing is to not depend on the whims of somebody else&#x27;s repository. In the best case, they&#x27;ll push an update and break your code for a while. In the worst case, they&#x27;ll delete their repo; then you get to find your local copy, push it to github, and change all your source files to point to that.<p>Heaven help you if other people want to fork your project. Say I wrote &quot;github.com/jff/bigproject&quot;, which depends on my package &quot;github.com/jff/mypackage&quot;. Now, if Joe wants to fork the package and make a tweak, he also has to fork the main project and change all of its imports to point to github.com/joe/mypackage so he can compile and test it. Of course he can&#x27;t very well push that, he&#x27;ll have to revert the import changes again assuming I accept his pull request for mypackage. I&#x27;ve dealt with this in real practice when we had 3 people working on a project which imported 3 other packages. We were forever dealing with build failures and changed import paths and of course could hardly do a pull from one fork to another. It was hell.<p>Better to distribute the entire workspace, with src/ containing all the packages you need and nothing else.",1387483018

In Toastmasters you follow a structured program to improve your public speaking skills, initially working through some canned speaking assignments to focus on specific skills, and over time working on more complex projects.

So while I agree on how things ought to be, that&#x27;s a far cry from how they actually are which, to sum up, is to say that we routinely discriminate against aliens, illegal and legal alike, especially in matters of employment, all the time.<p>This is why I brought up non-codified rights.  Most rational people would agree that a &quot;right to work&quot; is in fact a civil right, but it exists nowhere in the Constitution.  The Wagner act bears on this to an extent, but in short, it&#x27;s clearly a right that all people capable of working should enjoy, despite it not having been codified in the Bill of Rights, which means that its interpretation, however obvious, will not enjoy strict scrutiny, and is not even necessarily going to enjoy intermediate scrutiny, by whatever courts happen to be tasked with its interpretation.

It means we <i>can</i> start to treat the browser as just a renderer and get the infectious design decisions of the DOM out of our programs. If nothing else, this gives us freedom, but as david is suggesting, I think  this also gives us an opportunity to treat UI much more directly than we currently are. If you want to know what the state of your UI is, you just have to read linearly down through the code that produces your tree. No nest of dependencies, no state hidden in the UI components, you could even get rid of event hierarchies if you wanted.<p>More important than anything else, this gives us a chance to dramatically simplify our model for UI and magically be even faster than we were before.

Basically, his approach here is &quot;don&#x27;t be afraid of IEEE floats, just read the damn format and use your brain and do the work&quot;.  Absolutely.  I mean, I assume every reader of this comment is, in the case of sorting, better off using library routines, but I approve of the general principle.<p>His section on &quot;reducing the complexity&quot; is, while factually correct, basically trivial and a waste of reading time.  Unless you work in an incredibly constrained environment, in a very primitive language, with no libraries.  In which case, okay, that&#x27;s good trick.<p>The bit on &quot;Temporal Coherence&quot;... sigh.  First of all, I have never heard of this name (&quot;temporal coherence&quot;) for this property.  Maybe that&#x27;s my fault?  The property (of performing well on sorted input) is interesting, but it&#x27;s even more interesting to perform well on nearly-sorted data.  Go look at insertion sort for small data, or timsort for large data.  (Or just use timsort for everything all the time, honestly).  His optimization costs an extra n comparisons, and occasionally saves a lot of time but mostly saves no time.  Whether it&#x27;s worth it depends on your expected input data.  I dunno, I&#x27;m not impressed.<p>As for his &quot;nice side effect of temporal coherence&quot;, I confess I didn&#x27;t entirely understand his example, as evidence by the fact that I&#x27;m doubtful that his code sample works, but either way the property is already achieved by your choice of:<p>* any stable sort\n * any library sorting routine that doesn&#x27;t completely suck<p>So, touting this as a special benefit is a little stupid.

Anyone who figures out that such a policy exists will quickly come to the realization that the easiest way to get a raise is to put themselves onto the market.

6937115,comment,6933360,6933888,1,0,PeterisP,,,"1) The BTC market isn&#x27;t that liquid (compared to, say, USD-EUR forex). If you want to buy/sell X BTC on behalf of your customers right now, you may be unable to do it quickly in that amount. So, you can&#x27;t really wait until the final confirmation of &#x27;money from buyer&#x27; and only after that start to do things - you may finalize the deal at that point, but you&#x27;ll do some buying and selling before that simply in anticipation of the deal coming on. You can and should manage the open positions so that they aren&#x27;t too big in any one direction, but generally you&#x27;ll have to be part market-maker and have reasonable non-tiny reserves in both USD and BTC just to do your daily trades; otherwise at times you&#x27;ll be unable to make deals and have to cancel/fail/postpone them which hurts your service.<p>2) &#x27;When you receive money from buyer&#x27; is a tricky issue. In general, you won&#x27;t get the money from the buyer when you want it and in the full amount. No matter if you accept credit cards, ACH or whatever - some of them can be reversed, some of them will be reversed, and again, noone will simply trust that you&#x27;ll return the money when needed, so they&#x27;ll freeze or hold some of that money for some time. Well, unless you can prove that you have so big reserves that you don&#x27;t need the money anyway.<p>3) As you don&#x27;t have any reasonable reserves/trust/credit rating, in any relations with other financial institutions (such as paying out funds) you&#x27;ll be required to either cover everything upfront, generally a day before (which is expensive to you), or hold deposits/bonds/whatever as collateral (which requires the collateral); so right there you&#x27;ll have to hold reserves comparable to your daily turnover. In order to get a dollar to customer on Dec 15, you&#x27;ll have to give away the money some time before that.<p>4) The same holds if you want to integrate in any of the payment systems worldwide to receive and send money - if you want to get direct access (instead of extra price+delay by going through an intermediary), expect to put up multimillion deposits simply to ensure that noone else loses a dime in any case. The general principle is that counterparties occasionally tend to go bankrupt or act fraudulently, so everyone extends only very limited $ amount of trust. This, coincidentally, causes almost all of the payment processing time in the &#x27;classic&#x27; banking - you can send the payment cheaply in seconds, but it takes a few days to do this in a manner that ensures that one bank doesn&#x27;t lose money if another doesn&#x27;t pay, either intentionally or because it&#x27;s unable to.<p>5) The financial partnership deals you get depend on your size - the bigger you are, the safer you are perceived; the smaller you are, the more you pay for the same things. And I&#x27;m not talking about $25m-capital-small - small means a tiny local bank or &#x27;pocket bank&#x27; of some person or company with $250m+ in assets; 25m capital means you don&#x27;t even get to talk about non-standard terms for servicing your account, much less get them.<p>And there are other issues. It all adds up - each such item holds up some funds, so in general, you need a sizeable capital that&#x27;s proportional to your total turnover; and the <i>full</i> turnover of USD->BTC->USD, not just your revenue.",1387480991

6937085,comment,6933861,6934211,2,0,bonemachine,,,"Unfortunately -- and this is one of the many &quot;banana peels&quot; in Perl 5 -- even a simple statement like<p><pre><code>    print x if x > 5\n</code></pre>\nis problematic in p5 for a whole bunch of reasons:<p>(1) At a bare minimum, what you really need to say is:<p><pre><code>    print &quot;$x\\n&quot; if $x > 5;\n</code></pre>\nThat extra &quot;\\n&quot; is a definite turn-off to a lot of people when the get their very first look at Perl.  Really, the default these days should be more &quot;say&quot;-like.  Of course, &quot;say&quot; is there as of 5.10 if you know where to look for it, <i>and</i> you go out of your way to enable it:<p><pre><code>    use feature &#x27;say&#x27;;\n    say $x if $x > 5;\n</code></pre>\n(2) In &quot;modern&quot;, better practice, production-quality Perl you pretty much have to either hedge <i>every</i> comparison op with a check for defined-ness:<p><pre><code>    use feature &#x27;say&#x27;;\n    say $x if defined $x && $x > 5;\n</code></pre>\nin order to head off an unsightly warning about $x not being initialized:<p><pre><code>    Use of uninitialized value $x in numeric gt (>) at print-if.pl line 5.\n</code></pre>\nor add even more boilerplate to suppress the warning:<p><pre><code>    use feature &#x27;say&#x27;;\n    {\n        no warnings &#x27;uninitialized&#x27;;\n        print $x if $x > 5;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nor be <i>very</i> attentive about how $x can mutate once it&#x27;s gotten passed whatever validations you&#x27;re imposing on it before it enters your scope -- via e.g. Params::Validate, Method::Signatures, <i>provided</i> you know these tools exist and are up to speed and hip as to how to use them effectively.<p>(Yes, I know that in some contexts, the warning on &#x27;uninitialized&#x27; can be very useful.  But my point is, most of the time, and especially for novices, it&#x27;s more of a misfeature).<p>(3) We shouldn&#x27;t gloss over the fact that the magical pseudo-grammatical construction the &quot;infix&quot; <i>if</i> syntax provides is itself problematic in many ways.<p>In the current example, it simply isn&#x27;t clear -- <i>until you&#x27;ve become very comfortable with the language!</i> -- if the original statement<p><pre><code>    say $x if $x > 5;\n</code></pre>\nis or is not equivalent to the very similar construction<p><pre><code>    $foo = $x if $x > 5;\n    say $foo\n</code></pre>\nThis is because it is by no means obvious as to which of the more &quot;active&quot; parts of the original expression -- either the &quot;verb&quot; (print) or the conditional (if) -- takes precedence.<p>And unfortunately, it&#x27;s not only possible, but terribly easy to &quot;whip up&quot; fare more volatile constructions like this in Perl 5.  Various on this theme -- gotchas about print, conditionals, and complex &quot;if/unless&quot; constructions -- were of course given ample treatment in <i>Perl Better Practices</i>, to the point where (I believe) that Damian pretty much eschews &quot;trailing&quot; if/unless constructions altogether.<p>(4) Lastly, it&#x27;s sad to say that for all the complains of Python having too many safety belts and what not, it completely <i>nails</i> the hidden complexity management issues embedded in such a simple construct like Perl&#x27;s &quot;print-if&quot; idiom.<p>In Python, basically the only sensible way to achieve the original desired result is to do this:<p><pre><code>    if x > 5:\n        print x\n</code></pre>\nPerfectly clear, completely unambiguous, and basically impossible to screw up.",1387480785

6937047,comment,6931035,6932247,2,0,tanzam75,,,"> <i>I have to point out the VLS launcher has a seriously weird all-solid-fuel design. I am not a rocket scientist, but, as an engineer, I have to wonder what the hell those rocket scientists knew no other spacefaring country did since nobody launches satellites on all-solid-fuel rockets.</i><p>Sure they do.<p>For example, NASA&#x27;s LADEE mission was launched to the moon in September 2013 on a Minotaur V: a five-stage all-solid rocket.<p>Last month, India just launched a Mars orbiter using the PSLV: a 4-stage rocket with only the second and fourth stages being liquid.  The first stage was solid, and had 6 solid rocket boosters.  Thus, it launched entirely on solids.<p>And of course, there are lots of liquid-fueled rockets with solid boosters on liquid-fueled rockets.  The French Ariane 5, for example, has one liquid core stage plus two solids.  The solids produce 92% of thrust at liftoff.  Solids are great at producing thrust.<p>The American Titan IIIc rocket took this configuration to its ultimate conclusion.  It was launched solely on the solid rocket boosters.  The liquid-fueled core stage did not even ignite until a couple of minutes into the mission, i.e., although it was at the bottom of the stack, it actually served as a second stage.<p>If you&#x27;re talking about spacefaring nations that avoid solids, you&#x27;re really only talking about the Russians, Chinese, and Ukrainians.  They only use solids on military missions, and stick with liquids on civilian missions.  They get the necessary thrust by clustering lots of engines together.<p>The Chinese moon rover, for example, was launched on a Long March 3B with a total of 8 engines ignited at lift-off -- 4 liquid-fueled engines in the core stage, plus 4 liquid rocket boosters.  Yes, that&#x27;s right, even their strap-on boosters are liquid-fueled.",1387480533

See e.g. Bleichenbacher &#x27;98.\n  5. RSA is used to encrypt semantic data. Dangerous for the same reasons as above.\n  6. The hash function is broken.

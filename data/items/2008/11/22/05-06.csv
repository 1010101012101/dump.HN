Then the next year, and the following years come, and you realize that 95% of your classmates are still as immature as they were when you met them the first year.<p>Maybe it was just my school.

372764,comment,372573,372714,0,0,tdavis,,,"While I would not call it ""entirely repulsive,"" the act of random sex has always been far less fulfilling for me.  We are also some of the rare males who consider it possible to have ""bad"" sex. I collectively refer to us as: Connoisseurs ;)<p>That being said, I wouldn't call the average college student immature. The older I get, the more I realize that the line between ""maturity"" and ""immaturity"" is incredibly fine and not at all well defined -- and one can occasionally act immature while still maintaining maturity.  It's not as simple as, ""People who goof around and worry about nothing but sex and booze are immature while people who worry about making a living and reading leather-bound books are mature.""<p>Strictly speaking, maturity in this case simply means ""having reached an advanced stage of mental or emotional development characteristic of an adult."" Now, given that stage, what you choose to <i>do</i> does not necessarily directly reflect on whether or not you've reached it. For instance, a mature person in college may realize that, all things being equal, their college years may well be the last they have to truly live care-free and without serious responsibility. Given this rationale, would you fault them for using that time to pick up random men/women, drink five nights a week, and generally just focus on having fun?<p>Now, if they continued this lifestyle after college perhaps they aren't mature enough to realize that they must now change their behavior in order to thrive under their new circumstances. Or, perhaps, they just don't give a damn. To me, maturity simply indicates that a person is fully aware of the ramifications of their actions and are willing to own those actions. I don't consider a 40 year old CEO any more mature than a 40 year old McDonald's worker, provided they both want to be where they are and know exactly how they got there. Would you say that Lester from <i>American Beauty</i> one day became <i>immature</i> or finally <i>mature</i>? Or neither? Or both?",1227333305

Focusing on getting laid and getting drunk is not what youth is for.  At the same time, being too serious and just trying to make money is also not the best thing (that's what I did throughout my 20s).  I'm 40 and still learning how to find appropriate balance in life.  At least by now I've realized that finding balance is the key.<p>So I guess if I had to seriously answer the OP, I would say to my old self ""find the way of the tao.""",1227333183

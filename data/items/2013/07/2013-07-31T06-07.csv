Sure, in most dialects you are given access to Arrays, Classes, and other types that are well used. And you can choose to avoid lists, just like you can avoid using dictionaries in Python, and Lua. But I find that the cons cell is used rather commonly in standard Lisp code.",1375253996

6132259,comment,6129148,6130822,5,0,rdtsc,,,"> And there are projects, such as couch db, which are based on Erlang but are moving away from it. Why is that?<p>That is news to me. CouchDB is knee deep in Erlang and loving it. They are merging with BigCouch (from Cloudant) which is also full on Erlang.<p>Come to think of it, you are probably thinking of Couchbase, which doesn&#x27;t really have much &quot;couch&quot; in except for name and couch&#x27;s original author working on it.<p>> Rather, it&#x27;s because languages which are highly optimized for concurrency aren&#x27;t always the best practical solution, even for problem domains that are highly concurrency bound, because there are a huge number of other practical constraints which can easily be just as or more important.<p>That is true however what is missing is that Erlang is optimized for _fault_tolerance_ first then, concurrency. Fault tolerance means isolation of resources and there is a price to pay for that. High concurrency, actor model, functional programming, immutable data, run-time code reloading all kind of flow from &quot;fault tolerance first&quot; idea.<p>It is funny, many libraries/languages/project that try to copy Erlang completely miss that one main point about and go  on implementing &quot;actors&quot; run the good &#x27;ol ring benchmark and claim &quot;we surpassed Erlang, look at these results!&quot;. Yeah that is pretty amusing. I want to see them do a completely concurrent GC and hot code reloading (note: those are hard to add on, they have to be baked in to the language).",1375253611
6132258,comment,6124462,6132013,1,0,foobarbazqux,,,"I agree that fatalism was an unnecessary distraction.<p>The point about energy vs. willpower is that you cannot point to any precise biological mechanisms for willpower, but the claim that willpower competes with cognitive processing for processing resources suggests that there is a precise biological mechanism, in the same way that the coexistence of aerobic and anaerobic energy processing suggests a precise biological mechanism.<p>The box doesn&#x27;t yield measurements of willpower and cognitive processing.  It yields measurements of memorizing a phone number and choosing to eat cake.  We bind those things to our terms in order to generalize and create a model.  Models are fine.  But the problem is taking the model and saying the model actually maps to reality inside the brain.  Even the authors of the paper in question hedge on this mapping with the words &quot;seems like&quot;.<p>Models are unfalsifiable because they are models and we made them up.  The only thing that is falsifiable are hypotheses about behavior derived from the model.  My irritation is when models of the brain that we do not possess the tools to validate in the brain are taken as neurological truth.  I can suggest other models that fit the experimental results, and there&#x27;s no way to say whether mine are worse or better.<p>As far as I can tell, we agree about the utility of things outside of the box.  But I&#x27;m not sure if we agree that the way the box works on the outside doesn&#x27;t generate testable claims about how it works on the inside.  As an example, if you write me a program that converts one list of numbers into another list of numbers and give me a binary (without the GPL...), it is actually not possible for me to tell what algorithm your program uses.  I would have to disassemble it to figure things out.",1375253553

It allows to abstractly structure a document (e.g. by defining environments that give meaning to a paragraph, like summary, conclusion, proposal etc), it allows you to define new commands (like functions), variables, conditionals and much more. For me, LaTeX is something in between writing and programming, where content is strictly separated from the layout.

6132224,comment,6129237,6130987,2,0,hoov,,,"> Tell me, what is less effort: Implementing that, or building a small app/service that performs the functionality you need using existing tools?<p>I think it depends on your use case. In certain cases, you want to do work inline. In other cases, you want to do PS manipulation in the background. I could imagine projects that go in either direction. If I had a large Python desktop application, I&#x27;d port the code. If I had a Django application that wanted to do background processing of PS documents, I&#x27;d put the work on a queue and have Ruby take care of the messy bits.<p>> Also I&#x27;d consider the suitability of a given technology before this too, e.g. on my current project there is a lot of Ruby code, but it&#x27;s a major bottleneck in one of our services performing a particular task. We rewrote that service in Clojure and it performs orders of magnitude faster and uses orders of magnitude less memory.<p>I take a different approach. If I find a bottleneck in Python code, I use ctypes or write a C extension. I&#x27;d do the same thing in Ruby. I&#x27;m hesitant to deploy multiple runtimes, since I worry about security updates, etc. If I were on JRuby, Clojure would be a natural fit -- I&#x27;d only be deploying one JVM.",1375252792

After all, this is a thread where we come to comment, so why not throw five minutes of my life into some writing, using my BT keyboard, on a big heavy iMac.<p>First, saying that there is &quot;barely a laptop in sight [in the Bay Area]&quot; is just rubbish - there are _plenty_ of laptops in and around the Bay Area, the Valley, Southern California, California, the United States, the world. Startups - your users are not all in San Francisco. It&#x27;s like Tim Cook saying &quot;there are no Android phones at BJ&#x27;s Grill.&quot;<p>I appreciate the forward thinking of this app in a very &quot;post-PC&quot; era kind of way, but showing a screen of MacWrite from 1984 in the app page is just ridiculous - there have been _plenty_ of great mobile-based word processing applications in the past few years, in case you have not noticed. From Pages to IAWriter to Textilus to Evernote, the list goes one. Saying the &quot;software that we use to get work done has not evolved over the past thirty years&quot; is just utter nonsense. It has evolved, quite a bit. As much as I don&#x27;t want to praise Microsoft, they&#x27;ve been improving Word (sure, Office for iOS is terrible) slowly but surely over the years. It&#x27;s a solid WP and you give credit where credit is due.<p>With regards to this application, the &quot;thread approach&quot; to document sharing and collaboration is an interesting notion. That is if you share a lot of documents with other social-based users a la FB style, but I highly doubt you&#x27;re going to see attorneys redlining agreements in a feed - although it would be nice to see people chatting regarding a document, pitch, brief, agreement in real-time - but hey, world doesn&#x27;t work that way (especially at $500 an hour). I don&#x27;t think a lot of users &quot;enjoy&quot; word processing. We do it do get work done!<p>Editing document also appears to be a little strange (although I don&#x27;t have anyone to collaborate with yet) but the concept of  including &quot;documents edits&quot; in the activity feed makes no sense really. WP&#x27;s such as Word (and WordPerfect in the past) have always been known for a rich set of features, tools for various professionals, the people who use WP&#x27;s all the time. Formatting options, graphics, tables, charts, margins, etc. These are all very important features for the bulk of users. So while I understand the product and the &quot;modern word processor&quot; buzzword, it&#x27;s important to define what a &quot;modern word processor&quot; is/should be and how you&#x27;re going to get the majority of the world (95%) or a small chunk (<10%) to shift away from Word and to this modern design.<p>I get it - it&#x27;s a social thing, the buzzwords are there, the skeuomorphism is flowing with the manila folders, but Word Processors have in inherent attribute that is tough to rewrite with graphics and sharing and @mentions: it&#x27;s functionality. And that&#x27;s all the matters.<p>Best of luck to you guys.<p>Edit: I wanted to add that it&#x27;s important to test, use, and discuss [new] applications with an open mind. This is their first release, so things will undoubtedly improve, user feedback is so important to a new startup/product. Your users are everything - and certainly those outside of SFO (sorry had to). I think Quip can learn a lot from comments here on HN, no matter how long you work on a product and polishes the edges, it takes someone from the outside looking in to really give you some great direction at times.",1375252609

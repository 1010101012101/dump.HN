But there are ways of getting feedback on a product without doing a major product launch. Like, say, making 50 prototypes and trying them out on Google employees and external user testers. There's no way these problems wouldn't have surfaced in user tests. I suspect all the major issues would have shown up with just 5-10 testers.<p>The question is: why didn't they do that?

Frontiers generally tend to be nearly exclusively male (at one point the Wild West had a gender ratio of 50 men per woman, and this is not isolated.  Consider the early classical practice of having the men march off in search of fortune, for example.<p>The thing to keep in mind here is that women have a narrower window of opportunity to start a family than men do.    If you are 40 and male, and you are not married, you could still get married to a younger woman and have kids, but if you are 40 and female, you are less likely to be able to have kids.

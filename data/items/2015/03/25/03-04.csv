Usually either a fixed 32 or 64 bits.<p>If you want to talk about asymptotic growth of an algorithm, you need it defined on a machine model that supports infinite memory.  Saying that pointers are special O(1) size values are a reasonable way to do that.  Another way is to let them be variable size, and include that cost in your measurements.  With your 64-bit pointers, you&#x27;re overpaying that cost.  And the transition from 32 bit pointers to 64 bit pointers is an object lesson on the real existence of this logarithmic factor that you&#x27;d like to pretend doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Edit: also, going with O(1) pointers, the expected asymptotic space usage doesn&#x27;t mean anything without specifying the probability distribution of dictionaries involved (maybe parameterized on the size n).

The critique in this article is spot on. Squid basically pretends that the operating system&#x27;s virtual memory system and disk cache simply don&#x27;t exist, and spends it&#x27;s time working against them. This does cause exactly the kind of problems detailed in the article.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s because Squid is not Varnish. Squid was designed a long time ago, with maximum portability in mind, and intended to run on operating systems with very poor VM and disk cache systems. With that in mind, Squid&#x27;s design makes sense. It just doesn&#x27;t make sense on newer systems.<p>In Varnish, all of this work was delegated to the operating system. This works very well. It&#x27;s certainly a lot simpler than Squid, in addition to being a lot faster.<p>As long as most of your hot data can fit in the disk cache, at least. The infrequently used parts, which could well be a lot larger than the frequently used parts, can be kicked out to disk by the OS, and although reading them back in incurs a performance penalty, it&#x27;s not that bad. It only really affects less commonly accessed data, and doesn&#x27;t interfere with everything else.<p>The original varnish design works great for that. It&#x27;s less good if your entire working set fits in RAM (in which case, the slightly newer malloc-based system is faster because it has lower overhead, but becomes much slower if you really need to swap).<p>Varnish starts to fall down if your working set doesn&#x27;t fit in RAM (in which case, you&#x27;re doomed regardless), or if the total cache is really huge (think somewhere in the terabyte range).<p>The new storage engine mostly just re-organizes the existing mmap-based caches. It has better cache eviction algorithms, which give a much higher cache hit rate, and much lower internal fragmentation. That alone accounts for nearly all of the performance benefit.<p>The only I/O change I can find is that it uses the write syscall to write newly cached objects to the file directly, rather than writing to the mmap file. That allows them to replace the contents of those pages atomically - the OS will just drop them into the disk cache, rather than potentially having to re-read them from disk if they happen to not be in the cache.<p>All of the reading, memory management and I/O is still done by the VM and disk cache systems of the OS. That hasn&#x27;t changed.",1427252523

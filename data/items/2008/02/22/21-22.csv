121603,comment,121137,121550,0,0,duncanr,,,"I agree with your post 100%, but I think I'm generalising more than you're thinking I am.<p>My cards out on the table: I'm not a student of Economics (a deficiency I intend to correct, as time permits).<p>In terms of evidence, I have none. However, I think I need to be clear as to what I mean when I say 'raw materials'. It's probably a poor phrase to use (I guess it has a well-defined meaning in Economics); I consider even intangibles to be 'raw materials'. As an example, education is the 'raw material' on which 'intellectual property' is built. As a web developer, the LAMP technology stack (for example) is the 'raw material' (along with many others, including education) on which websites are built (and aren't we hackers lucky that people make much of that technology available to us for no cost? There's huge value in those 'raw materials' for us. Most people in the world aren't so lucky). For me a raw material is anything that acts as an input into a process that leads to a monetisable output. Of course, money itself is perhaps the ultimate 'raw material' in this sense, creating an interesting situation where one of the raw materials used to create the desired product is the product itself. Perpetual motion machines may be a physical impossibility, but a perpetually expanding economy apparently is not.<p>There are certainly many examples of low-resource cities that do very well; at least, low in terms of the amount of stuff that can be dug out of the ground. These are obviously not the only saleable resources or those cities wouldn't exist (I'm not sure about Hong Kong, but didn't Singapore first become wealthy due to its strategic location?).<p>As to the high-resource locations mired in conflict and poverty, I would suggest that much of this conflict is indeed related to who controls the raw materials.\nWhilst this may or may not be true, I was more thinking originally about internet posts on economics and 'social justice' in my first comment, which seem to me to boil down to whether ownership of resources (of many types) should be 'more equitably shared' by some 'fairness' metric, or owned only by those able to compete effectively for them (or who just get lucky).\nOf course there are many threads on what is actually meant by 'more equitable sharing', since all participants seem to feel that their approach is the most equitable without exception :-)<p>Hopefully I've not led too many people down dead-ends with my rather wooly use of the term 'raw material'.",1203716865

121584,comment,121137,121137,0,0,toffer,,,"I keep seeing comments about how the original builders of Legotown were unjustly punished for being successful little proto-capitalists.  The argument goes something like: ""They added value to their raw materials and created something great and beautiful.  Then they were struck down for being better than their peers, and all the children were doomed to a life of uniform mediocrity.""<p>To me, the story of Legotown was not one about capitalism.  The questions about whether the builders added value to their Lego brick raw materials, and whether the trading game only allowed zero-sum transactions are irrelevant to the larger point of the story.<p>To me, the story of Legotown is about legitimate and illegitimate authority.<p>By what right did the original builders of Legotown assert their authority over the Legos?  Why were they able to make the rules about who could use the Legos and who couldn't?  Because they got their first?  Because they built the best, most elaborate structures?  Because they were bigger?  There were no classroom rules that allowed them to claim ownership of the Legos.  Instead, they took control of the Legos by force and simply asserted their right to make the rules about them.<p>Yes, capitalism requires adding value to raw materials and ability to trade freely, but it also requires the rule of law that is accepted as legitimate by its participants.  If there had been rules about claiming ownership of toys in the classroom, then the builders could have followed those rules and then enforced their own rules about things that they owned.  But, in the absence of such a governing framework, they cannot simply assert that they own something, and then expect others to accept their authority.<p>That's also the real point of the trading game.  It wasn't to model capitalism.  It was to show the children how it felt to be treated in a system ruled by arbitrary, illegitimate power.  By what right do the holders of all the green Legos get to make the rules?  Why should their power be considered legitimate?  The answer is it shouldn't, because tilting the game in favor of the green Lego holders is obviously arbitrary and unjust.  And, if it's unfair for the green Lego holders to make the rules in the trading game, how is that different than the original builders making all the rules about who can and cannot participate in Legotown?<p>In the end, the children earned back the Legos.  But, it wasn't because they agreed to a more ""Socialist"" set of rules imposed by the teachers.  Instead, it was because the children came together and agreed to a set of rules that reflected their values of fairness and justice.  And, because the rules were the result of their input, the children considered them to be legitimate.",1203715847

There's never any real guarantee of service unless an ironclad SLA is hammered out, and I suspect that if Google gets traction with Gmail for Domains, they'll do it.<p>When I was at Google (2003-2004) we had something like 10 seconds of user-visible outage.  That was before Gmail, but it was also with a staff of ~200 people and ~250K servers.  I have every reason to believe that Google can still stomp the shit out of all contenders on uptime; they just need some incentive to do it for specific services.<p>(my $0.02 only; I don't work for Google anymore.

My goal in my entrepreneurship is not to exit to $millions; it is to create a long-term sustainable lifestyle for myself where I am continually doing work that I find interesting and also have have the time to enjoy other pursuits...<p>Viewed through that lens, then as soon as dissatisfaction or a lack of motivation become chronic rather than intermittent, it's clear that something needs to change.<p>It sounds like you have been trying to whip yourself into shape -- trying to create external motivations to push you through tasks you no longer find enjoyable on their own.

121576,comment,121175,121175,0,0,dreish,,,"Personally I find that the hardest part is just getting started (and I sometimes find this extremely difficult, spending hours surfing the web or watching TV to put off making the first code edit of the day).  Once I'm programming, I tend to block everything else out to the point of forgetting to go to bed.<p>Mentioned a while ago here was a ""martini method"", and I realized the above after I started using that a few weeks ago.  For review, the modified version of the method I proposed is just to do<p><pre><code>   while true\n     do\n       echo -n `date` "" ""\n       svn diff | wc -l\n       # or git diff -- I'm going to switch to git soon\n       sleep 600\n     done\n</code></pre>\nand exercise as much self-control as possible to avoid some specific set of timewasting or otherwise enjoyable activities (traditionally, drinking a martini) until the diff reaches a certain length.  (Occasionally I give myself a break if I just came off a hugely productive run the previous day, or if I'm just wiped out from my day job.)<p>However, I accidentally set what turned out to be ridiculously low limits (because of the extra metainformation and surrounding lines of code that svn diff prints out).  As it turned out, I didn't need to revise the limits upward, because it turned out I was frequently (not always, but that doesn't matter) staying engrossed in the task long after I'd reached the limit.  I realized that it was enough to create an incentive to reach that easy goal, just to get me to switch to the task.<p>The best part is that I never sit down feeling like I've got some insurmountable pile of work I have to do, even though the project I'm working on as a whole is much larger than I'll ever be able to do by myself.  When I task-switch, I'm just focused on thinking of what little piece I can do next.  I _can_, if I want, make a few small scattered trivial changes, and I'm done for the day, but usually it's enough to get me thinking about the code, so I usually stay at the keyboard.<p>The fact that the goal is so easy to reach also makes self-control a lot easier.  It's really no big deal if I feel like vegging for the whole evening -- I just have to do a smidge of work first.  And I usually find after I've taken that first little step that I wasn't as tired as I thought I was.",1203714884

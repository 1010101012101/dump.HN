Given that you admit to knowing nothing about literary criticism, so I'm curious to know how you can be so sure of what you say here.</i><p>In theoretical physics there is an absolute authority by which to judge what is good and bad, namely the degree to which it conforms to reality.  Appealing to this authority may be challenging and may not ever be practical, but it exists and it therefore means something specific to say something is wrong in theoretical physics.  Also, when that theoretical physics is later applied being wrong about it can be have real negative consequences.<p>It is not clear to me that saying something is wrong in literary criticism even has a meaning, and even less clear that it would ever matter if something was wrong.<p><i>If you think this then you clearly agree with me that there is something that is valuable in and of itself (i.e. utility to mankind). But valuing utility above everything else is clearly wrong. For example, beauty, love and compassion would be valuable whether or not they had utility.</i><p>I actually do agree with you that some things (including beauty, truth, and love) have intrinsic value.  But I take that belief starting from a Christian view point.  If one were to examine it a priori or from an athiestic viewpoint it is not at all obvious or clear that anything has a value outside of its practical utility to mankind.",1257341714

For many purposes offering a degraded service would be better than nothing and could perhaps be handled with 1.5x your needed resources rather than 2x.  It may also be possible to make use of this fabled cloud to take the 0.75x resources you have left after an outage back up to 1x.<p>All this does add development time though and, as you say, for most sites it isn't going to be worth it.",1257339769

I admit that this is a reasonable hypothesis that explains part of what can be observed, but it is a rather big leap to get to ""a community will not fail as long as its populated by the elite"". Even the elite has a finite attention span, after all, and any sufficiently large community is likely to splinter into sub-communities anyway. Either that, or people have to stop posting all but their best posts - and that does not seem likely.",1257339690

The company remains private and has no institutional or venture capital investment.""",1257339630

Lists are all members-only, but once you&#x27;ve been added you have a lot of control. Private (within the team) subgroups are a feature we&#x27;ll likely charge for, along with Google Apps integration. We&#x27;ve also seen a lot of interest in a product that can be installed behind a firewall, but that&#x27;s a little further off.<p>One thing we know for sure is that we won&#x27;t charge based on the number of users in your organization.

You can still get motion sickness from e.g. going on a virtual roller coaster that would make you sick in the real world, but you won&#x27;t get sick just sitting in place (which is why the new demos do just that).<p>2. Far away objects look pixelated, and very close objects look incorrect because the depth of field is wrong. However, the 3D effect is much better than with any previous 3D technology, and there&#x27;s an overwhelming sense of real scale that you don&#x27;t get watching e.g. a 3D TV set. You feel placed in the 3D world and you can easily judge the size of things relative to yourself.<p>3. If your friend knew about the Rift they would easily be able to tell that it was VR; however there is also a perceived feeling of it being real that doesn&#x27;t go away just from knowing that it&#x27;s not.

Perhaps, a better example are children&#x27;s toy jewellery which on numerous times have been found to have toxic levels of chemicals (eg. lead to levels high enough to send children into hospitals). Do the inspectors actually test for lead, or is their some sort of certification paper that is required?<p>What about those cheap electrical parts that you can buy (e.g. computer/iphone power adapters). I read a tear down report stating that these were unsafe because wiring not done to safety codes, so who is responsible for inspections before they enter the border?<p>The general case is complex, and I&#x27;ve never been able to read how the process is handled, so I assume given the quantity of products being imported they are often priced so cheap because they never go through the QA and safety standards that would be required if they were manufactured here. --Another example of pricing that doesn&#x27;t factor in the total cost of the good, that is Chinese toys are cheaper than local because they aren&#x27;t tested to our codes thereby avoiding whole cost structures that local companies incur resulting in cheaper products yet overall they are more expensive to society because 1% of buyers end up in the hospital and incurring those costs.",1395243785

However, if your statement is more that a centralized system is not perfect I agree.<p>The single payer system in Norway works generally so well that health-care is something a norwegian does not have to worry about. This is very different from the USA where it has to be on the top of your mind, and a significant portion of the population has no insurance.<p>> Doctors don&#x27;t have time/incentive to diagnose problems unless they are obvious (or you&#x27;re related to a politician -- yes, like in Soviet)<p>You are still buying in to the cold world propaganda where socialism equals communism, and because soviet was communist then all socialism is bad?<p>Even america has socialism in all it&#x27;s confusing array of emergency and social support infrastructure. However, the system here is not well organized and therefore confusing and inefficient.<p>I think the discussion would be more productive if we focus on if there should be more <i>more</i> socialism in the US, and if that is a good thing. Pretending that socialism does not exists in the US government is not productive.<p>> From my own and friends&#x27; experiences -- simple knee problems that stopped favorite exercise, lack of iron/vitamines that gave depressions, hard to recognize allergies that resulted in tiredness, thyroid problems etc.<p>I know people that have been diagnosed and treated for all of these and more complex issues in Norway. And no, the people that got treated was normal working-class families with few connections. However, anecdotes are not very useful since I am sure you can find those in any health-care system.<p>I see a lot of these anecdotes from opponents of single-payer health care, and I am sure you can find plenty of anecdotes in any health care system. However, do you have any study comparing health care systems that supports your claim that a single-payer system can <i>never</i> work?<p>Evidence seems to suggest otherwise and Dr Danielle Martin answered some of the more common &quot;evidence&quot; given by opponents like e.g Sen.

If you need to draw 10 numbers in all places, then configuring that value in the module will work. But localy, when you look at the code, it won&#x27;t tell you how many numbers you are drawing.<p>If you have this in many different places:<p><pre><code>    MegaLotto::Drawing.new.draw\n</code></pre>\nYou don&#x27;t have the information of how many numbers you are getting back. That&#x27;s not a big deal, but adds to the cognitive load (or requires some comments). Also, if you need to draw different numbers in several different places, you will have to change the configuration many times:<p><pre><code>    # First use, we need 10 numbers\n    MegaLotto.configure do |config|\n      config.drawing_count = 10\n    end\n\n    MegaLotto::Drawing.new.draw\n\n    # Second use, we need 6 numbers\n    MegaLotto.configure do |config|\n      config.drawing_count = 6\n    end\n\n    MegaLotto::Drawing.new.draw\n</code></pre>\nAnd as soon as you do that, you may need to take multi-threading into account, because you are mutating the class.<p>Extrapolating, it is like defining the size of an array:<p><pre><code>    Array.new(4)\n</code></pre>\nIf instead you configure Array.new to have a given size for all instantiations, you also lose locality and you may run into thread safety issues.<p>In the case of MegaLotto::Drawing.new needing multiple configuration options, you can use keyword arguments. If you need too many arguments, maybe the abstraction is wrong. Even if you want to move forward with too many arguments, you can add getters/setters to the newly created instance:<p><pre><code>   # Another approach which modifies the instance\n   drawing = MegaLotto::Drawing.new\n   drawing.size = 10\n   drawing.draw #=> returns ten numbers\n</code></pre>\nBut this is not optimal design given the elements we have.",1395243223

And don&#x27;t tell me that these basic multimeters incur significant R&D costs.</i><p>You&#x27;ve obviously never done any serious electrical or electronics work then. The reason they&#x27;re so expensive is four reasons:<p>1. Mains and high voltage work. If you&#x27;re working with high voltages or massively different potentials, Fluke actually design the boards and isolation circuitry properly. You&#x27;re not going to get electrocuted by a Fluke meter. It doesn&#x27;t even take a high voltage, just a bad earth to kill you. Cheap multimeters and even mid range ones tend to ignore this fact in favour of cost.<p>2. Explosion resistance. If you stick your cheap multimeter in resistance mode and whack ot across a 400v 30A supply its going to blow your hand off. No joke. Fluke - dead meter <i>by design</i> or absolutely nothing and it still carries on working.<p>3. Reliability. I have a 1989 Fluke 87 that cost me a small fortune. It works fine today, still handles calibration perfectly and is pin sharp and accurate. Other vendors fall to bits, drop out of calibration ranges and pack in completely. I know because I have three meters at any time and the only ones that survive are flukes.<p>4. They have lesser effect on the circuit you are measuring because the input stage is better designed.<p>So you&#x27;re merely putting your life in the hands of a $10 meter.<p>My current fluke cost me £435 and it was worth <i>every damn penny</i><p>Edit: adding some more as I&#x27;m not posting this from my phone now:<p>5. Cheap meters can&#x27;t do true RMS measurements.<p>6. Cheap meters have probes without correct insulation.<p>7. Cheap meters have probes which fall to bits and expose the conductors.<p>8. Cheap meters have less probe/connection options which are required for more than just passive metering.<p>9. Cheap meters can&#x27;t be calibrated at all by calibration services as there is nothing other than a single master voltage reference inside which is usually not a constant current or voltage source but a resistor/voltage divider across the reference voltage. This can drift as batteries drain for example.<p>10. Decent meters have a better count i.e. 0.00000 vs 0.00 on the displays.<p>I could go on forever at why a $10 meter is a joke.",1395242772

Since it also involves an additional investment of time, that means the posting itself would have to be closer to my ideal vision for a job working for The Man.<p>Companies use barely-functional pattern matching algorithms to automatically toss your resume into the garbage.  It is very likely that any effort you spend hand-tailoring your self-advertisement will be wasted anyway.  But let&#x27;s assume that you&#x27;re doing it to pass the bozo filter and talk to a real person.<p>If you have to feign specialization to get past the auto-rejector, it is safe to assume that the company sees fewer qualified candidates.  Supply is lower.  As long as the posting remains open, demand remains the same.  Therefore, the more specialized the role, the higher your expected remuneration should be.  It&#x27;s fine that companies are picky, but not both picky and cheap.<p>My advice is to use a general, unmodified resume for all your initial applications, and only to tailor your resume if the company does not respond in person after the first 2 weeks.  If that generates a response, remember to ask for a higher salary if you reach the negotiation phase.<p>Of course this, like most other advice, should be taken with skepticism, because it is based on my experiences, not yours.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t spend much time customizing a resume, because I already have a job, even if I don&#x27;t like it, and a lot of the postings that I see are just as flavorless and uninspired as an untailored resume.  My primary criteria for applying are whether the job itself seems like it could be interesting after you subtract the HR boilerplate and whether the company makes it easy for people to submit themselves for consideration.<p>If applying is as easy as writing an e-mail with a resume attachment, I will take the time to write an original cover letter.  If I have to jump through 8 pages of hoops where I have to re-enter my entire resume into a series of tiny text boxes, I will not customize anything.  And on the 8th page, where I am asked to list 3 of my weaknesses in an HTML form, just above a request for my entire salary history, I will almost invariably list &quot;I get snarky when confronted by foolish or wasteful hiring practices.&quot;  At that point, I have already invested that much time on an application that I know will not yield fruit, so I can&#x27;t help but feel bitter about the utter waste of it.",1395242619

Software is not special in this regard (the &quot;math&quot; argument is tiring).<p>What is not clear is that a patent free environment would be preferable either, as the inner workings of modern processor tech might be kept trade secrets or worse, no one bothers to develop this technology at all.

Not in the sense of not covering off your skills and experience, but in the sense of making you seem like you care about what I need as a hiring manager.<p>First off, it gives no sense of the importance to the business of anything you&#x27;ve done. You could produce the best-engineered code in the world, but if it&#x27;s not fit for purpose or it doesn&#x27;t help us achieve definable and verifiable goals it&#x27;s junk. You need to show that you understand that. The best way to do that is to include accomplishments like &quot;Wrote a Perl simulator that improved test throughput by X% and saved Y hours of development time.&quot; Even better are ones that include &quot;made $Z million dollars&quot;. You have to relate your achievements to the goals of the business.<p>Second, it&#x27;s got things that would make me worried about even calling you for an interview. Why do you feel the need to specify reasons for leaving positions? That makes me nervous. Why do you need to tell me that your phone handles SMS? That&#x27;s weird.<p>This feedback&#x27;s based on building and leading teams over the past decade or so. I&#x27;m younger than you though not by too much. You will probably be dealing with people of my age or younger who are going to be focused on the relevance to the company if what they do, more so than its technical sweetness. You should tailor your message accordingly. I do <i>not</i> advocate dumbing down your resume. I do recommend focusing it on relevance to the business.<p>I also recently struck out again first as a contractor and then in a purely technical (no people management) full-time role. I got some time with a career consultant which helped immensely, though they were useless when it came to actual recruitment. I&#x27;d recommend you do the same, as they could help you tailor your message to the industry.<p>(I also built a Linux distro back in the day btw (early 2000s), for an PC104-board-based embedded systems project an acquaintance of mine was working on. It&#x27;s not on my resume, because that project didn&#x27;t go anywhere, and isn&#x27;t really relevant to the kind of jobs I want now.)",1395242288

What is the deal really ? I may be missing the whole point but for me it seems to be, summed up : keep as much of the core business logic separated from the interface because one will die sooner than the other. Then the correct model depends a lot on the platform you&#x27;re building on, and the freedom to try and design new paradigms seems to me a much more valuable asset than trying to force-fit your app into MV-WTH. I feel we don&#x27;t even remember what constraints these models are here to help optimize. Please tell me if I&#x27;m missing something.

I believe you would consider him an immigrant. He specifically chose Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) because of its reefs (and likely other reason, but that&#x27;s his main stated reason). But by all accounts, he was a British ex-pat in Sri Lanka.

They are there to provide some consumer protection.<p>I will be speaking of New York.<p>First of all, a medallion isn&#x27;t strictly required to operate a taxi-like car (for hire vehicles). It only affords them the permission to pick up passengers who flag a cab off the street. You are allowed to operate what is called a  &quot;car services&quot; or &quot;livery cab&quot; too, they are allowed to only pick up and service people who call ahead to arrange the ride. Since the summer of 2012 livery cabs may pick up people who hail a cab outside the borough of Manhattan to serve undeserved populations (excluding the airports). Having a medallion means you are required to pick up any passenger who hails a cab, the first one you see, no matter if they are drunk, homeless, disabled, black, going to an undesired destination or otherwise &quot;undesirable&quot; passengers. Having a medallion also strictly regulates fares no matter what kind of car your medallion taxi is, including flat fees to get to the major airports. Taxis are regulated to look a certain way so you know you&#x27;re getting into a licensed taxi and not a serial killer van. There are also very regular inspections of the vehicle to make sure it is up to safety standards. The authorities conduct undercover operations that ensure taxis are following the rules. The license plates bear a variation of the medallion number so that police can easily identify violators. It can be said or argued the limits of number of medallions is because there is limited space on the streets and you might not want them to be mostly taxis at the expense of other vehicles, before the medallion system there were at one time more taxis than taxi passengers. You also don&#x27;t desire taxi drivers working very long hours to make a profit with excessive competition, because they might become fatigued and fall asleep at the wheel. Also the cost can facilitate the funding to enforce the regulations.<p>Is this the best system? I don&#x27;t know, but it is there for a reason.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicabs_of_New_York_City"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicabs_of_New_York_City</a>",1395241350

Your resume and/or public profiles mention both your age and your religion.<p>Secondly, you mention that people have disagreements about the value of generalists.  While this is true, it does seem there is consensus on the fact that as the field has developed over past decades, jobs have become more specialized, and failing to cater your resume to the type of position you are seeking is a huge part of the reason you are not getting interviews.  I can understand not wanting to &quot;throw away&quot; all the stuff you&#x27;ve done over the years; wanting that to be acknowledged is a very human thing, very understandable.

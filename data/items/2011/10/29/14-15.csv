3171993,comment,3170732,3171148,3,0,michael_nielsen,,,"The open access to publication argument already has nearly unstoppable momentum.  In 2008 the NIH --- by far the world's largest funding agency, with a $30+ billion dollar a year budget --- adopted a policy requiring that all NIH-funded research be made openly accessible within 12 months of publication.  See, e.g.: <a href=""http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/nihfaq.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/nihfaq.htm</a><p>Similar policies have been enacted by all 7 of the Research Councils in the UK.  And there are many more such policies in place at institutions all over the world, including Harvard, MIT, Princeton, and many others.<p>A treasure trove of information about open access is Peter Suber's website.  See, for example, his timeline: <a href=""http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/timeline.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/timeline.htm</a><p>The timeline stops in 2008 (he changed jobs), but if you look at progress up to that point, it's clear that this has enormous and rapidly increasing buy-in at grant agencies, libraries (who are the main ""customer"" for journals, in that they pay) and major universities.  It will be very difficult for other parties to stop this change, provided people continue to work for it.<p>At this point, momentum is starting to build for more open data, and also for other kinds of systematic online sharing of research information.  Why not give researchers an incentive to (say) upload online videos showing how certain lab experiments are done?  At least in some labs there's stuff that's very difficult to describe in a paper, but easy to show in a video.  And so this would be very valuable.  (There are initiatives underway to do this, e.g.: <a href=""http://www.jove.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jove.com/</a> )<p>I entirely agree with your final point - ""The system of funding and promotion is going to have to undergo a very big shift before this dream comes to life"".

Implicit lambdas (""[=]"") capture ""this"" pointer for data members, if you capture a shared pointer and let the lambda object leave the scope, the shared pointer won't be copied (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/7764564/23643"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/q/7764564/23643</a>), which may create unpleasant results, like code blowing up in your face.<p>2. Overuse of ""auto"" (not exclusive to C++) may make the code harder to read, especially if storing a result returned from a function. You can't tell if the return value is a smart pointer or a raw pointer, value or a reference, so you can't figure ownership semantics just by looking at the local code.<p>3. Move constructors/assignment operators are a bit of a black magic, especially with regard to suppressing default implementation (<a href=""http://mmocny.wordpress.com/2010/12/09/implicit-move-wont-go"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mmocny.wordpress.com/2010/12/09/implicit-move-wont-go</a>) and exception safety (<a href=""http://cpp-next.com/archive/2009/10/exceptionally-moving"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cpp-next.com/archive/2009/10/exceptionally-moving</a>).

Thus if you had a skulking permit that authorizes you to steal and kill, you legally could commit what was a crime.<p>Permits, as treated/used by the US Government, are just another form of taxation. It has become ""pay up, or it's illegal"". According to my understanding of the Constitution this is illegalbut that's never stopped our government before.<p>So, with the requirements in place to make it illegal to manufacture/brew/sell food (including beverages, like lemonade or even tea) without a permit, we get a crackdown on kids selling bottled drinks or lemonade made from a mix, to enforce the laws.<p>And that's still ignoring the peddling license and the business license.<p>Just take a look at the permits/licenses required to operate shop today, and what is illegal because of it. I can't even finish my basement off without paying for a permit. For example, a heterosexual couple can't get married in most states without a permit. This practice came from interracial marriage being illegal in the 1900s and requiring a permit; prior to this time marriage was a (primarily) religious institution and people married without governmental interference. The idea of a marriage permit has since been promulgated as a ""good idea,"" and ""common-law marriages"" are considered ""bad ideas"".<p>Give the government an inch and they take a mile...<p>Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer.<p>[1]: I had to paraphrase because I don't own a copy.

3171947,story,,,5,1,fatveesh,"The Administrative Stuff (especially for NYC folks)",,"This is a question for the guys in NYC. As you know, it's unreasonably expensive to start a company in NYC. The state registration fees are bearable (~$400 after everything), but then the requirement to advertise in local newspapers costs you a good $2000 due to NY advertising prices and the fact that the state randomly picks newspapers so you can't just pick cheap ones. Given that cost, i've decided to incorporate in Delaware. Of course, it didn't take me long to realize if i actually wanted to open a bank account / conduct transactions, etc, i needed to open a ""sister LLC"" in NY, or basically register as ""doing business in NY state"" which basically costs the same as registering a new business in NY, so now i have to pay two states. Great.<p>Anyway, i've also found that accountants/lawyers on Craigslist who claim to help with all this startup administrative stuff don't really help at all. They don't care to offer advice, they just tell you how much they'll charge you to fill out standard paperwork.<p>So my question is -- what have you guys done to figure out all the administrivia, when on a tight budget? Like i want to give this new programmer some equity that vests in 6 months. Do i just write him an email saying ""You officially now have x% of the company, provided you complete yyy hours over the next zzzz months""?. I heard you can print out stock certificates. But couldn't anyone just go to a printer and print a stock certificate for some random company for some random number of shares? What document/company/bureacracy actually owns all these allocations? Is a locked Google spreadsheet with people's names next to ownership stakes good enough to hold up as ""the official company ownership charter"" in a court?<p>Mainly, have you found good people in NY who help you with all this crap? Anyone gotten free advice form the Small Biz Admin, or any of the little initiatives Bloomberg has setup supposedly to help struggling entrepreneurs?<p>HELP! lol",1319898721

Essentially he may <i>be</i> black but he doesn't ""act black"".<p>Also, if he's one guy in the startup that's ok -- it fits the pattern. If the whole startup is black, maybe you wonder if they're ghetto. Doesn't fit the pattern because you haven't seen it before.<p>The bro who shows up with a noticeable accent and stereotypical behaviours is at a disadvantage.<p>Successful blacks become invisible because they don't ""act black"" because the old stereotype is that you can't be really black and successful (except in sports, or entertainment).<p>Someone once said to me: ""So these guys were real niggers, you know, not like you  -- I mean trash.""<p>On the one hand, I was offended. On the other hand, I knew what he meant.",1319896824

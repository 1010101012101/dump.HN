I didn't read all of this but I don't think Zed sees/said what I think is obviously(debatable I guess(like ID is debatable)) the main problem with music in general and esp online music and double esp independent music is The Music Industry.

While I'm not at the programming skill level that HN is targeting, I'm learning a great deal from the articles I find here and I think I'm becoming a much better programmer as a result.  HN is my first read every day and I appreciate being able to access it.  Thank you very much.",1235785886

The latest facebook ToS episode tells us as much.  To continue Schneier's automobile analogy, we're not solving pollution by un-inventing cars, but by coming up with even better clean technology.  Similarly, reducing data collection doesn't seem to be a viable option; instead, we're going to have to come up with better technologies for access control & data anonymization.",1235785201

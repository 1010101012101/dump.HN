Even at the end of its life, a reduced 4 hour battery life will be plenty sufficient, and when it finally kicks the bucket, I&#x27;m happy to have Apple service it.<p>In my original 2008 aluminum macbook pro, I replaced the hard drive once, upgraded the memory, and replaced the battery; but none of these things are as relevant or limited as they were in 2009. I have no need for the equivalent upgrades anymore. The machine just works, exactly how I want it to.",1388505598

The population of manhattan peaked around 2.3 million in the 1920s. The population of Beijing, Guangzhou, or Shanghai are all about 20 million plus.<p>There were fewer automobiles in London even in the mid 20th century than there are in the big Chinese cities today (there are over 5 million cars in Beijing alone). Many of those automobiles are either diesel powered trucks, buses, and cars or 2-stroke scooters and motorcycles, all of them highly polluting. Add to that the heavy reliance on coal for home heating and cooking and you have the pollution nightmare that is now quite evident. The population of the entirety of the UK was only 50 million in 1950, and the population of the US in 1950 was only 150 million.<p>Today in China nearly 50 million people live in Guangzhao alone, and over 100 million people live in the top 4 largest municipalities, within an area that is in total similar in size to Los Angeles county.

StackOverflow is filled to the brim with people giving fishes.<p>This hits the nail on the head, imo. While the SO system is (presumably) meant to reward &quot;karma&quot; based on the <i></i>quality<i></i> of answers, more often than not it seems that <i></i>quantity<i></i> is just as important. And it&#x27;s not hard to see why this is the case -- there&#x27;s an inherent risk in typing a well thought-out (read: time consuming and potentially <i>long</i>) answer, when a simple one-liner is probably all the questioner is really seeking.<p>On the other hand, maybe that&#x27;s what StackOverflow is really for -- getting things done, NOW. Even if that &quot;getting things done&quot; answer is just a band-aid, and the questioner hasn&#x27;t really learned anything.<p>In my experience, people who find themselves applying band-aid after band-aid to their code (myself included) rarely connect the dots all the way back and realize that all their subsequent problems were largely due to their initial &quot;fix&quot;.",1388505525

Which gives me the same benefit that JS has: no mental context-switch between client-side and server-side code.<p>Using Clojure(script) I can do a lot of stuff:<p>* Command line applications, think everything from simple cron jobs to daemons to command-line utilities (replaces: clunky PHP scripts)<p>* Backend servers (replaces: PHP, NodeJs)<p>* Web client stuff using Clojurescript (replaces: browser-side Javascript)<p>Potential bonus uses:<p>* Mobile apps, using either Clojure proper or Clojurescript+Phonegap (replaces: clunky Phonegap apps). I don&#x27;t know how feasible this is in real life, though.<p>* Desktop applications (replaces: nothing that I&#x27;ve ever tried). Again, don&#x27;t know how feasible this really is.<p>Language features that I like:<p>* Functional programming<p>* Good concurrency support<p>* Homo-iconicity, macros<p>* Lexical scoping, closures<p>* Good REPL<p>* Elegant (AFAICT), not a pile of weird hacks, quirks and gotchas like JS and PHP<p>* Compiles to JVM (Clojure) or JS (Clojurescript) which makes it/them very portable and able to interact with a huge array of existing code/libraries<p>So, Clojure/Clojurescript would be my current best bet for a really powerful all-purpose language. It would also be a welcome challenge: I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of functional stuff in the past years, but Clojure would really up the ante there.<p>Feel free to chime in if you have a suggestion of a different language that could also fit the bill :)",1388504190

Python3 was always going to be a slow migration; perhaps it&#x27;s going even slower than planned, but that&#x27;s not the disaster the OP portrays (in fact it sounds like you&#x27;d have just as much trouble migrating to python 2.7 as python 3, so there&#x27;s no python3-specific problem here). Python3 is now at a place where distributions are adopting it as default; non-bleeding-edge folks will follow their distribution&#x27;s lead.",1388503481

We do that in flint, and it is faster. But it&#x27;s more like a factor of two, which makes me very suspicious of the benchmarking there.<p>There was a Scheme implementation which once beat GMP for very large integer multiplication, and Magma was also once faster. But those days are long gone. GMP beats what a compiler can do by a factor of 4-12 depending on the compiler version and their high level algorithms are insanely technical.

To me a terrorist is a guerrilla fighter who lacks popular support where they are fighting and specifically attacks soft targets for political (rather than military/tactical) goals. Regardless, the casualness with which &quot;collateral&quot; deaths of civilians has been handled for several of the US&#x27;s recent military activities may be of a different nature but not necessarily on a higher moral standing. This is probably most true of the US&#x27;s participation in the Yemeni civil war over the last several years, but there is much else worthy of approbation. The theory of arming surveillance drones was always that it would enable attacks on extremely high value targets of opportunity using precision guided munitions that would limit collateral damage. In practice it has resulted in an unprecedented expansion in the extent of the currently active battlefield and a weapon system which appears to be on the same moral level as the car bomb in the degree to which it causes deaths of innocent civilians.",1388503385

Power consumption and thermal output are related in an almost linear proportionality, twice the power consumption, twice the thermal output.<p>Since clock frequencies stopped going up some ten years ago, we&#x27;ve had a 5x to 10x increase in single core performance (in addition to multi cores) thanks to increase in power and thermal efficiency and smaller transistors.

6990750,comment,6985304,6986672,1,0,tsahyt,,,"Many NP-hard or NP-complete problems have (infinitely many) instances that are &quot;easy&quot; to solve. It is quite straight forward to write up a procedure that produces infinitely many instances of 3-SAT that can be solved in polynomial time by the DPLL algorithm. But it is important to note that a <i>problem</i> is actually a set of instances.<p>Your observation basically boils down to &quot;how rare is the worst case?&quot;. There are actually algorithms with exponential worst case complexity that are used all over the place because - on average - they perform really well. The simplex algorithm for linear programming is an example for such. Every version of this algorithm comes with a worst case problem such that the algorithm has exponential runtime. However, on average it is quite a fast algorithm that can handle millions of variables and corresponding constraints on modern hardware. Still, that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that linear programming is - from a theoretical point of view - still hard enough that we cannot <i>generally</i> solve it faster than in exponential time. As is the case with DPLL, good heuristics can speed up an algorithm a lot without changing worst case complexity. Other examples are all over the place in AI. It&#x27;s also in AI where the concept of <i>pruning</i> is probably encountered most often. This the practice of discarding whole subtrees of the search tree by some sort of heuristic or deductive reasoning.<p>Those things aside, I think what we should be looking at from a theoretical point of view is when it makes sense to consider the average case complexity over the worst case complexity. This brings us back to &quot;how rare is the worst case&quot;. Quicksort for instance is said to be an O(n log n) algorithm but it has O(n^2 ) worst case complexity (trivially so). However, it can be decided in O(n) whether this case actually occurs and hence a good sorting implementation could switch to a different algorithm once this has been detected (something similar happens in the std::sort function that&#x27;s been implemented in the STL). This is definitely a case where it makes sense to &quot;forget&quot; worst case complexity.<p>For SAT, researchers have actually worked up statistics on how hard certain instances are in terms of the number of clauses and the number of symbols. It turns out that there is a range of ratio between the two where problems are the hardest (roughly between clauses/symbols is between 4 and 6). I don&#x27;t have a source right now but googling &quot;satisfiability threshold conjecture&quot; might turn up some results.<p>As such, yes, not all <i>instances</i> of NP-hard problems are actually hard to solve, but there are infinitely many that are. Encountering such problems in practice one can usually make use of the special problems of the instance (or class of instances) one actually encounters and devise an algorithm that performs rather well on average.",1388502221

The average amount owed by graduates with outstanding loans 1 year after graduation was $20,100, compared with $10,100 (2009 dollars) in 1994.&quot; Source: Trends in Debt for Bachelor&#x27;s Degree Recipients a Year After Graduation: 1994, 2001, and 2009 (Tables 3, 4)<p>So 1 year after graduation, of students with remaining loans, the average amount owed was 20.1k, and the median monthly payment was 8.0% of salary <i>at the same point in time.</i> But after a year or two salary should increase substantially, so loan payments should be a much smaller percentage. And a total average remaining debt of 20.1k after one year certainly isn&#x27;t ideal, but it isn&#x27;t really that unreasonable either, nor should it be especially burdensome. Obviously some people are dramatically worse off than this, but for most people the system doesn&#x27;t seem especially broken. But to answer your question, I think that you need to look wholistically at total net cost increases, along with total debt, along with monthly loan payments and employment statistics. Looking at any one on its own will be highly misleading. Also keep in mind that different types of institutions and degrees lead to dramatically different outcomes in all of the above. I&#x27;m really only concerned with 4-year degrees from public or private non-profit institutions, because 2-year degrees and for-profit colleges are largely scams.",1388502171

Any differences in feature set are largely due to them running some custom version of Android which probably cost a lot more than running stock. Just slapping Froyo on it would have made the feature set as comparable as you could get.<p>So in terms of pricing (and probably only pricing) it's a fair comparison. It illustrates that vendors could compete with Apple on pricing if they wanted. I think they're quite wise not to, everyone saw the race to the bottom on PC margins that happened in the late 90s and decided they'd opt out this time around.<p>You're right about the phones, others are subsidized, though usually with an upfront fee rather than an ongoing. The rumors in the early days were that Apple's monthly fee is much more than most other phones get, and that's why AT&T got them over Verizon, but who knows.<p>Many PC vendors have service at least as good as Apple's. I've dealt with both HP and Apple, they're pretty comparable. And with HP you never have to hear the term ""genius bar"".",1289347192

1888391,comment,1886873,1888195,0,0,AgentConundrum,,,"At the moment, I have a website that I'm working on. I'm generally terrified of speaking publicly about it, since I'm taking my time with it, and anyone here would consider it a weekend project. Since it's the first major project I've undertaken, I'm absolutely paralyzed by design considerations, etc. since privately I'm quite the perfectionist. When I'm working for someone else, I know I don't have the luxury of being a perfectionist, so I've learned to make the necessary tradeoffs, but privately it doesn't work that way.<p>I want to be able to leverage this project to get a proper job (""hey look at this! I've shipped something!""), so that just drives my paranoia into overdrive. Literally hours spent messing about with colours (""Is this yellow ok, or should it be more muted?""), rather than coding an extra feature. The colour point is rather moot anyway, since I've got a touch of ye olde colourblindness.<p>I think I should set a target - I'll have it online by... the end of next week! We'll see how I do.<p>The rest of my, shall we say, ""vacation"" has been spent<p>a) terrified that I'll never get a job again:<p>I'd spent three years in COBOL-land and any pretense of actual skill had long since rusted over. I had pretty much no inclination to code anything after work, since the job sapped my energy so well.<p>Even before that job, I still didn't think I was really any good. A programmer-turned-sysadmin friend of mine from college seems to think I'm good. When he moved to England, he said something about maybe recommending me for the job he was leaving. When I expressed these concerns, he said I was smart and could pick things up fast, had faith in me, etc. Unfortunately, my self-esteem sucks, and it's reflected in the projects I start.<p>I tried to teach myself C#, Java, some python.. but I got so caught up in the details that I didn't get anywhere. I wasn't creative enough to come up with a solid ""use it in anger"" project, so I'd just give up.<p>Now, I've got the aforementioned web project, and I'm teaching myself PHP to get it done, but I still feel like a pretender.<p>b) RSI.<p>I had started seriously learning from UNSW's YouTube videos, and was reading lots of books, taking notes, etc. when my arm was engulfed in pain. For a couple months, I didn't type much, didn't do much.. I was convinced I was royally screwed and would never be able to code again... at age 25. The pain has mostly gone - I've typed this whole thing without pain - but it does come back from time to time, though the same friend I mentioned earlier is convinced it's psychosomatic at this point. He's probably right, to be honest.<p>c) Job offer.<p>I signed a conditional offer back in February, to do a job horribly similar to my last job. I figured I could take that job and use the money from it to take courses, etc. I thought the structure would help me maintain enough inertia. Instead, the job fell through when that company didn't get the contract they were hiring for. It took until June to get that notice. I'd used it as an excuse for being lazy during that time, thinking the problem was solved when it wasn't. Incidentally, the RSI started about the same time the job fell through, thus strengthening the case for the RSI being psychosomatic.<p>Sorry for ranting, but when I started writing this, I got self-conscious about how lazy/incompetent/whatever I am, and I think I'm being defensive when it isn't necessarily called for. I just.. I don't think things are actually going to work out, and it occasionally makes me contemplate suicide. I need to catch a break, but I haven't earned it yet.<p>/rant",1289345155

Any way, giving an introductory high-school class in Python, Ruby, or Lisp is IMO counter productive because of the whitespace requirement, the flexibility in syntax, and the amount of parenthesis on their respective languages.<p>I said two things:<p>1) I think Python is not a good language for high school because of it's syntax which is not directly translatable to the bulk of other programming languages (and I say the same thing about Lisp now that I'm on it). At this point I made a comment that I would find Ruby a little tiny bit better (but not suitable either) because of it's forgiving syntax, not because of the flexibility aspect of it's syntax (as omitting parenthesis and comas would probably lead to confusion). Python is not forgiving in it's whitespace requirements, while Ruby can make use of blocks and curly brackets in a way that translates better to other programming languages.<p>2) That I learned C at an early age and it had a big impact in the way I developed as a programmer, to which you responded that you learned Java a year earlier than I did C without making a point out of it. What is this a competition now to see who learned to program earlier?<p>What language you learned on makes no difference 5 years later, but it does have a big impact on the first, maybe second year. As such, it should be a language where the knowledge and workflow is easily transfered to other languages.

But anyone who remembers those days knows that the complaints were LIES: everyone had access to a wide variety of alternatives, ranging from CB radios to postcards to tin cans interconnected with string! So what if that whining ultimately made it possible for the Internet grow beyond the confines of a few university campuses, and for the US to become the world leader and hub of Internet development? Now all of that growth and wealth and innovation will forevermore be tainted by by poisoned circumstances of its illegitimate origin.

(a) common-sense, 
(b) compatible-to-mainstream perception of what is ugly, and
(c) willingness to look around for ideas and play with things they might consider boring.<p>I have yet to encounter a decent developer that manages to do without (a) -hm, ok maybe I know one java developer, but he's a special case!- (b) seems about equally common and (c) is only a matter of motivation.<p>On the other hand, most designers I have met appear unable to try grasping and utilizing the simplest of programming concepts. I don't know if their brain is wired differently or if they despise or fear that stuff so much that their subconscious blocks anything related, but, in any way, they seem much less capable in producing any code in any amount of time, than most developers in producing a pretty and usable design in a reasonable amount of time.<p>That's just my simple observation, based on the 15-20 people of both professions that I know well enough.<p>So, for projects that want just a good design (i.e. at the level of twitter's) and not an WOW-super-original design, I think that the work is fundamentally simpler than coding, doesn't need much expertise and most developers can do it pretty well <i>if</i> they want. For those projects at least, which is the majority, I don't see how designers are, or should be, more valuable than coders.<p>For more specialized projects, like a desktop environment, usability experts and designers might be a requirement, but still, I wouldn't go as far as to consider them more valuable.",1327469584

That is because everyone agrees that human rights should be upheld, thus there is no argument to make.<p>You make some very good points though. If Apple is to charge just above the cost, thus making ""enough"" profit, whatever that may be, then you say Apple would beat all competition. You say that is so because they are very efficient. Perhaps, but I think it is more likely that they would beat everyone because of their inventions. Iphone, Ipad. Efficiency therefore has little to do with it. Just as Bill Gates became a billionaire despite of any efficiency. They invented something. Then they have gone on to exploit such invention by ripping people off through charging them 30% more than the product is actually worth. Not 10, not 20, but 30. That is greedy and the consequences are concentration of wealth in the hands of the few for their benefit alone.<p>As for the solution, government already decides how to distribute wealth through taxes. I think it should go further. Perhaps there should be a law that no man can be paid in total above, say, 1 million per year. Nor can any company make more than 10 billion in profit. Both, of course, increasing by the base inflation point. With an individual is easier, you just make it illegal. With a company is more difficult. Maybe the profit above the 10 billion can be a rebate to those that purchased their product or service.<p>The very existence of the law would probably incentive companies to treat their employees and their customers better rather than focusing on a Darwinian jungle of eating everyone at any expense and ripping off everyone as much as you can get away with.",1327468990

The truth is that I only enabled a couple of languages because I was just too angry and frustrated to enable the rest. I know it doesn't make any rational sense, but my reptile brain is telling me that goddammit, Google is not going to make me click on fifty little boxes just to fix them erasing my preferences. Not today. Not this user. There is a part of the brain that is trained to recognize when someone is jerking you around or abusing you, and when it gets triggered inappropriately, it is impossible to turn off. (I'm sure anyone who has worked in customer service will recognize what I'm talking about. Right now I am the bug-eyed paranoid who is convinced they are intentionally screwing with me for their own amusement.) So long story short, yes, it seems immensely important to me that I have to check fifty boxes instead of one, and I still don't have my unfiltered search results, not until I calm down enough to go click on all those boxes.<p>As for the problem of change, I can sympathize with the problem they face.  I'm sure that globally minimizing user confusion and frustration is one of their goals.  As for me personally, they'll have to count me in the ""used the product incorrectly for years without realizing it and is now very angry about it"" category.<p>UPDATE:  EVEN ANGRIER:<p>So I swallowed my pride and went to work clicking.<p>""The page at <a href=""https://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com</a> says:<p>The number of language restrictions is limited to 8, so only 8 of the languages selected will be saved.""<p>That doesn't bode well.  But then:  ""The page at <a href=""https://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com</a> says:<p>Your preferences have been saved""<p>Ah, but guess which time it was lying :-/<p>So unless there's another way to turn off language filtering, Google will filter out every language besides your primary language and seven others.  (Yeah, your interface language counts as one of the eight.)<p>That's terrible.  Even without Google Translate, I swear I got useful information from a page in Polish once.  Plus there are pictures, video, miscategorized pages, mixed-language pages (what happens with those?) and the simple coolness of finding out that someone in Vietnam is using an open-source library you committed a patch to.  And of course, Google freakin' Translate!  Unless Google is translating every single page it crawls.  Which it might be -- that's something to think about.  But it does very poorly with some pairs of languages, and if it filters out every term it can't translate, then it will tend to filter out commands and symbols.  And here I am speculating about how it works again, which goes back to my original point.<p>With my track record today, I'm sure I'll find out I'm misinterpreting this somehow, but I'm starting to feel a little bit justified in my anger.  Ah, I can't lie.  I feel much less angry now that I feel like less of a fool :-)",1327468765

That helps people we know by not inflicting parts of our lives they don't care about on them. It also helps us, by allowing us to explore and develop one aspect of our lives with people we trust to help us, without allowing others who we don't trust to know about it or interfere with the rest of our lives as a result. One specific example of the latter idea is that maintaining privacy means someone who is trying to assess us doesn't get incomplete information that they consider relevant and then jump to conclusions based on getting the wrong idea.<p>The likes of Google and Facebook are now so ubiquitous that the complete destruction of that privacy for millions of people is a profit-seeking executive's sneeze away from happening. It's bad enough that they rely on this sort of perma-snooping on their own users on their own sites for their own advertising.

I do not know your compensation but I am going to assume somewhere south of 200k. If that is the case and there is truly 8 digits of investment equity then there should be no issue with carrying that kind of administrative burden. Now I know that those funds are separated from operational funds, but in a VC firm we are usually talking about a small amount of investors that enter the fund together, to claim that the funding is not there and cannot be obtained, to fairly compensate you would be a little disingenuous. I am not implying that they did, but if they do, I would question it in my mind. Keep in mind that it will be years before a first venture is liquidated for any return, so you could be at that compensation level for the better part of a decade with no bonus due to no equity positions being liquidated. While it has the potential to make you rich, you will also take a hit for a long time with no guarantee that any venture will ever pay off. I walked from a similar offer several years ago after an exit and for me personally if I where in your shoes I would walk to. If I had taken the offer I had I would still be waiting on the big hit as the group that made the offer to me, is now in the first stages of exiting some relatively small investments.

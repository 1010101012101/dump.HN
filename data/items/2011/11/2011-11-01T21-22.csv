3184342,comment,3182410,3184160,1,0,NerdsCentral,,,"Hi Scott,<p>I think I am reacting to the arrogance in the language. ""This is how research works."" is what you said. That is quite presumptuousness of you to say that because your language naturally suggests you are telling me something I don't already know. This is the case with this comment thread in general.<p>It could be cultural. In the UK, the way you and the other people on this particular comment thread frame words is really quite rude. I don't know where you are from so I cannot comment as it if you would know that or not.<p>If one were to say ""Surely, this is how research works."" then on offence would be taken. Or ""As I am sure you know, this is how research works."" But no, the words immediately speak to an assumption of ignorance on my part. That is offensive and I take offence.<p>I suspect also that news groups are easy places for people to make such mistakes. I have no idea how you think of me when typing. Do you imagine a 40 something doctor of computational quantum-mechanics trying to squeeze out a quick post before starting a day's work on the parser for a compiler for his client? Maybe you see a spotty teenager trying to wade beyond his depth?<p>I don't know you and you don't know me and so I suspect a little more automatic respect on both parts would not hurt.<p>Best wishes - AJ",1320184765

One reason that apple is where Apple is at as far a success goes is due to the fact that an overwhelming demographic of creators use Macs, From Audio, to Video all the way down to Development many times the Mac is the choice of the creator. People see this, and people fashion themselves of the same mold as the creators, I think this is overlooked and I think it is one of the core reasons that Apple is wildly successful, people perceive whether right on wrong that the creators use Mac's. I don't know if some of those creators in specialized fields like video production, will be so willing to move to laptops that do not compare to the Mac Pro line. So the question becomes, what happens with the Mac as a platform looses those creators, what happens if those creators find a new platform and that platform becomes known as the platform the creative use. I don't know if it means anything at all, but not knowing the answer sure seems like a huge bet to me, when all that hangs in the balance is a product line that does not have as great of sales as other lines. If it where me I would find out the answer to that question before I killed the line.

It uses a simple fixed format for all nodes, which works very well for datasets which contains many common prefixes and suffixes. For example, a polish dictionary containing 1.3 million strings is compressed down to 726KB. One of the thing I'm using it for is in a database for geopip stuff. It uses less than 1 byte per IP and can answer queries such as ""find all values for the given IP-range"" in O(k).<p>Dawid Weiss has a talk about how fine state machines are used in lucene at <a href=""http://vimeo.com/26517310"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/26517310</a><p>The two approaches I've seen used to store key-value pairs in lexicons are:<p>1. Embed the value using a magic separator. E.g. (key0, value0), (key1, value1) becomes ""key0.value1"" and ""key1.value1"". The lexicon supports fast prefix lookups, which is used when looking up a key. As an added bonus, it supports multiple values per key out of the box, and you can easily find all key/values for a given prefix.<p>2. Add support for perfect minimal hashing to the lexicon. It will give you a unique ID for all keys, which can be used to do a direct lookup in another array containing the values. How to do this is not covered by the paper, but is an interesting exercise for the reader :-)<p>Now, back to the article. As cperciva mentioned, the dataset in the article isn't completely static and the usefulness for finite state machines drops fast if they need to be recompiled often. However, the key-value pairs are immutable, so it would be straightforward to implement a level-based scheme by using a simple structure for new items and move them into compressed lexicons periodically.",1320183057

Suppose I'm reading function A and trying to understand it, then I find a call to function B which doesn't have any comment explaining what it does; I then go look at function B, and find it has a call to function C which is equally lacking in commentary; and by the time I've read the code in function C to understand what it does and gone back to function B to understand what it's doing I've completely lost track of what I was looking at in function A.<p>Of course, if you already know what most of the code is doing you don't run into such stack overflows because whatever code you're looking at is probably only calling functions you already understand.  But for people who are new to the code -- or people who haven't looked at it for a couple years and have forgotten most of the details -- I think asking people to read the code to figure out what a function does is too much of a bar to understanding.",1320181809

Using that system in a place without those limitations does nothing but make navigation harder because it's artificially hiding and limiting the amount of information visible.",1211115120

I like Paul's articles and ideas because I think he brings something unique and different many times. Wasting valuable neurons on something we all know (They got funded b/c they solved a problem, had a plan that we felt they could execute, and were smart enough to see that we create value for them) is just repetitive.<p>Stay the course, pg :)",1211114873

What we have with IPv6 is a technology that can't find its way ""to the masses"" other than through porn, or so think the creators of this web site. Just laughable. Picture a porn site that requires you to write a DCOM application for getting the videos.",1211114852
193321,comment,192959,192959,0,0,mojuba,,,"I can't believe everyone here agrees to this.<p>This is an incredibly stupid idea for promoting a questionable technology that can't make it into the reality on its own. If the technology is so ""right"" why isn't everyone switching to it (like IPv4, HTTP, etc)? Because there are problems with it: IPv6 is more complicated than needed for solving the problems it was meant to solve. And finally, advantages of IPv6 are so far only theoretical.<p>And I just hope this experiment will remain unique in this industry.",1211114318

258127,comment,257958,258015,0,0,ashleyw,,,"I agree, but I also think using a framework is just as good in the long run...<p>You basically have hundreds if not thousands of people working on your project with you, fixing bugs, making it faster, more stable, and adding under the hood features. Something you would need to do yourself if you created your own framework.",1217148649
258126,comment,258052,258052,0,0,ghshephard,,,"Stellar presentation.  Opened my eyes to what python has done for the last few years - one of my pet peeves, in place sorting of lists, has been resolved with the sorted function.  Thank the gods.  90 seconds later I was at Amazon.com purchasing the latest copy of Learning Python.   I've already been inspired enough to get my hands dirty and write a network strafeing harness in python for a project I'm working on.  Thanks Sunshine!",1217148604

Do you think nationalistic parties suddenly seize to be nationalistic in the moment they get the power to rule their country? Do you think that no government appeals to nationalism of their own people?<p>Nationalism is anything that appeals to members of a nation to defend a each other against a real or perceived threat. Nationalism of a national state gone big - China, Russia, Japan - becomes ""imperialism"".",1217148464

258121,comment,257958,257958,0,0,h34t,,,"After reading these comments I've realized that trying to ""go it alone"" in Python is biting off too much at once. It will be too long before I can finish anything usable, and I'll lose motivation.<p>So, I've decided to aim for ""FAST"" and use Django to get a working website out the door as soon as possible, and study programming at greater depth on the side (without expecting that effort to pay for itself immediately).<p>I started going through the book ""Practical Django Projects"" this evening and it feels right at my level.<p>Thanks for all your perspectives! I appreciate it a lot.",1217146922
258120,comment,257958,257958,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"One thing you should be aware of is that Django's philosophy is to cleanly separate between what designers do and what developers do. That's why you don't (by default) get to use Python in your view templates as you would in php/jsp/rails. Instead Django provides yet another mini language just for views, including control sturctures, expressions, etc.<p>If you are a designer and developer in one person, Django might not be the best match for you, unless you love something else about it (there are many things to love about Django)<p>I found that I don't use most of what web frameworks provide. But you could argue that just using Django's nice regex based request dispatching is worth it, even if you decide not to use their template engine at all (it's replaceable after all)<p>To sum it up, what is it that web frameworks do for you? It's basically request dispatching, forms processing (validation and stuff), view templates and ORM. If your applications handle a lot of form to database CRUD, using a framework is helpful. Otherwise you could just as well use naked mod_python because request dispatching is actually rather trivial and python already has a simple template engine built into the language.",1217146912

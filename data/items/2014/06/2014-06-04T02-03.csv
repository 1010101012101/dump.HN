My point is, activists like Graeber are bound by philosophical systems they don&#x27;t recognize, which have been in place for hundreds of years and which form the foundation of our entire modes of thought. He may dislike modern capitalism, but he probably accepts the core tenets of modernism which allow it, like the assumption that the good of man is to be achieved by man pursuing whatever his interests happen to be.

7843775,comment,7842420,7843656,4,0,logicchains,,,"Just a note in regard to the notion of the moral worth of work being the only thing relevant: this is actually one of the central ideas behind the capitalist paradigm (albeit in a different form). It takes the form that, assuming all value/morality is ultimately subjective (all value judgements are equally relevant), and that a person&#x27;s values are most clearly reflected in their actions, then whatever action a person takes at a given moment is the &#x27;best&#x27; action, the action they consider most moral, most valuable. If this action doesn&#x27;t limit the ability of another individual to act how they wish, then this represents a net gain in value. So if people&#x27;s voluntary interactions lead to lots of money/resources going to CEOS and pro footballers, for instance, then this is the best possible outcome assuming no coercion is involved.<p>This is where the capitalist notion of people pursuing their own pleasure without interfering with that of others stems from. This is a qualitative, not quantitative, notion of utility, and arguments have been made that it does not allow for interpersonal utility comparisons. Which is why hardcore followers of the theory (market anarchists) oppose regulation, as it necessarily requires coercion (making someone do something other than the action they&#x27;d most like to do), and without the possibility of interpersonal utility comparisons it&#x27;s not possible to justify any such coercion.",1401850398

Most of the issues you can get on a ballot are very local and have just as large, if not a larger effect on the cost of living of many people. For example, California has Prop13. This was a ballot initiative that caused your property taxes to be assessed ONLY at the sale of the property. In Arizona, it&#x27;s every 5 years for reassessment.

7843739,comment,7835099,7841104,1,0,m_mueller,,,"Thanks for your elaborate answer, I very much appreciate it. After these discussions, Swift sounds like adopting the best of the worlds of fast and dangerous (C, C++, Fortran), slow and easy (Python, Ruby) and slow and safe (Haskell) languages (I&#x27;m listing the extreme examples here from my perspective rather than the actual influences to Swift). I especially like the &#x27;safe by default - unsafe optional&#x27; stance, since this gives you the ability to create a working program quickly, but still optimise it later through introducing unsafe behaviour. This can allow Swift to be used for HPC purposes further down the road (provided [1] substantial parts will get Open Sourced, [2] it gets implemented on Linux and [3] it gets support for parallel computing both on node, core and accelerator level). Without having worked with it yet, here&#x27;s what I&#x27;d love to get in order to use it for HPC:<p>-UnsafeButWarn compiler options -> replaces safe versions of arithmetic / arrays with unsafe ones, but issue runtime warnings whenever unsafe behaviour has occurred. Meant for debugging the runtime into never going unsafe, such that checks can be disabled.<p>-Unsafe compiler option -> replaces safe operations with unsafe ones. Meant for the production version that has been extensively tested but needs to run as fast as possible.",1401849622

I believe there&#x27;s a site that does this but can&#x27;t recall the name.<p>- Reduce student debt by making expensive college degrees obsolete. I think the next step in that (now that we have libraries, wikipedia, coursera, udacity, etc) may be changing hiring practices: a startup that helps companies hire based on experience/aptitude rather than falling back to the college degree heuristic could have a big impact. Relatedly, other startups (or FOSS) might replace the traditional degree in other ways, like guiding students through free online tracks or connecting them to advisors, mentors, internships, peers, and jobs.<p>- Change how employers pay employees. Most large employers have cheap debt and/or lots of cash, while many of their lowest-paid employees have terrible credit. This means they have to rely on mind-bogglingly expensive services like Payday loans and credit cards to cover their basic expenses (which don&#x27;t come due on payday). A startup that helps employers pay daily instead of fortnightly, or pay bills directly, or even provide credit directly to their employees could put a <i>lot</i> of money back in poor pockets.<p>- I don&#x27;t know the other main sources of American debt. Car payments? Large houses? I just don&#x27;t know. But a systematic investigation of the sources of the debt, the costs of servicing it, and the underlying reasons it&#x27;s required may be a decent way to scout out some good ideas!<p>Ultimately, though, much of this comes down to Policy and Culture. Student debt would evaporate if we just had free education. Cost of Living would likely plummet if we had terrific public transportation. There may be tax schemes (land taxes?) that would lower rent/home ownership costs. A culture of minimalism would likely also reduce cost of living =)",1401849003

The easiest way to do that is to also inherit from NSObject.<p>Example 2 - typed arrays/dictionaries<p>You can shove any NSObject in an NSArray or NSDictionary but the Swift arrays are typed (a good thing) but one that may make some things more difficult for beginners.<p>I suspect it is the tip of the iceberg of type related complication. This is a worthwhile tradeoff for greater safety and despite this Swift will still be easier to use overall that ObjC in my view.<p>It may also take a while for the documentation particularly across the internet to catch up with the quantity of examples for Obj C but this is only an interim issue.",1401848110

Honestly, who gives a hoot that constant contact newsletters are sent in cleartext?<p>I need to worry about where my organization&#x27;s email goes, because quite simply, people do dumb things. Things like put payment information in email. Or PII subject to HIPPA or some other regulatory regime.<p>Secure SMTP gives me no solace whatsoever, because even if I ensure that my receiving party&#x27;s email gateway is secure, I have no assurance that any relaying happening behind that gateway is secure to the standards that I need to meet.

My organization requires an encrypted link or fiber owned and managed by the organization.<p>IMO, you&#x27;re better off operating under the assumption that your email is a postcard, because it is.

7843656,comment,7842420,7842420,10,0,fecklessyouth,,,"The Enlightenment produced a society which identified pleasure as its most fundamental social value. As Locke says, individuals are hardwired to pursue pleasure. And as Smith says, capitalism is the economic system best able to produce the most total pleasure. Thus, if you can produce lots of pleasure for people, if you are useful, if you can make money appear out of the stock market, you are rewarded. The jobs most rewarded by society are those that are most pleasurable to others, like CEOs who can turn profits for board members. The group who&#x27;s pleasure is the deciding pleasure is the dominant social group, who has the most of whatever currency matters to society. (Status, property, now cash)<p>Whether someone is virtuous, or caring, or helps others, is irrelevant in ascertaining their value, and thus how they should be paid. A teacher might produce pleasure in a student, but that student is in no capacity to makes its pleasure the deciding one. The moral good of a job is, at best, a footnote, and only valuable insofar as far as the dominant groups are pleased by them. The market doesn&#x27;t care about your moral good.<p>The mistake of writers like this one is supposing that such a system can be fixed within the confines of modern capitalism. It cannot. People will conduct their campaigns, and go on strike, and create new movements, and perhaps pay teachers more out of social duty and pity, but they will ultimately butt heads with the philosophical underpinnings of modernity. If this writer is serious, the solution is not to turn to mere Marxist-inspired theories of labor, but to Aristotle and Aquinas.<p>For what Aristotle, Aquinas, and essentially the entire stock of pre-modern philosophy, approached differently was the question of, &quot;what should our fundamental social value be?&quot; Their answer was not, &quot;pleasure.&quot; For Aristotle, it was the good produced by a life trained in socially-imparted virtues--which ultimately allowed one to contemplate the divine. For Aquinas, it was more explicitly religious: loving God, which entailed doing and believing all the things He wants us to do. And as was the case with the Enlightenment, the cultures that both these thinkers embodied were constructed around such answers, from the top down. In either system, the moral worth of work is not irrelevant, it&#x27;s the only thing relevant (with differences in how moral is defined).<p>In-depth rebuttals should be directed to Alasdair MacIntyre, a Scottish philosopher whose book &quot;Whose Justice, Which Rationality,&quot; I just paraphrased in part.

It&#x27;s just too misleading to do these types of overly simplistic data reports. The data set is flawed in many ways, including:<p>* Data model. The Chicago crime data only has a single date/time field. For many crimes, such as break-ins, the victim/reporter isn&#x27;t able to pinpoint an exact time; they might just provide a time <i>range</i>. That doesn&#x27;t jive well with the data model.<p>* Data mistakes. I dealt with public record databases extensively from 2005-2012 (Washington Post, chicagocrime.org, EveryBlock). Government data sets (like any data sets!) contain mistakes, which are compounded when you do aggregate queries.<p>* Systematic police department effort to reduce crime numbers through data trickery.

Hoping to see something within the year - not just for images, but also collection data (object records, for instance).<p>Many other institutions have open APIs for their collection data, and often for images as well. See:<p>Cooper-Hewitt (data released on github)
Brooklyn Museum (API)
Powerhouse Museum (API)
Rijksmuseum
Indianapolis Museum of Art (also data on github)
Europeana (a EU-wide consortium)
DPLA (similar to Europeana, but in the US)<p>Also, lots of other institutions have open access to their images - many much more comprehensive than The Getty (not to sound bitter, but Getty is getting a lot of press for this where others have lead for years). It&#x27;s really an imperative at this point - and for most institutions more a matter of when (since few have substantial technical staff) than if. The Getty is an exception, having a large, well-funded staff, but tends to be conservative in policy changes.<p>For other examples of cultural institutions sharing images widely:<p>National Gallery (high rez)
Los Angeles County Museum of Art
The Met<p>All this just off the top of my head -",1376693742

6227210,comment,6220820,6220820,1,0,lists,,,"Completely OT, but when Dijkstra says:<p>>My second remark is that our intellectual powers are rather geared to master static relations and that our powers to visualize processes evolving in time are relatively poorly developed. For that reason we should do (as wise programmers aware of our limitations) our utmost to shorten the conceptual gap between the static program and the dynamic process, to make the correspondence between the program (spread out in text space) and the process (spread out in time) as trivial as possible.<p>He&#x27;s touching on a crucial point in Immanuel Kant&#x27;s philosophy. Kant theorized that though humans received their sensations as a constant stream of input in time (which is an internal condition of human beings, not a feature of bare reality), we can&#x27;t actually do anything with that stream without applying concepts so as to form concrete (or abstract) objects, i.e. chairs, black holes, mothers, etc. But how would our minds know when to apply this concept or the other? Kant&#x27;s reply was that our minds look for little clues called &#x27;schematisms&#x27; which tell us what the most appropriate fundamental concept to apply to a part of the stream is, upon which others could be combined to produce objective representations we can think and act upon.<p>Almost a hundred years later, Nietzsche will claim (paraphrasing) that a measure of strength in a human being is the extent to which to which they can &#x27;consume&#x27; phenomena in time, weakness being how direly one needs to apply a static idea to phenomena (like morals, stereotypes, prejudices, cause and effect, etc).<p>I&#x27;m just noting an interesting entry point into an old philosophical conversation.

At first I see that Mailgun&#x27;s minimum was $19/month while Sendgrid&#x27;s silver plan is $10/month.  Easy, Sendgrid wins.<p>Oops, I want to support inbound email though.  Sendgrid will give you that on the trial plan, but not on the $10 silver plan.  Suddenly I&#x27;m up to $80/month to use Sendgrid.  Mailgun wins here.<p>But before I even noticed that I had already signed up for Sendgrid (believing I&#x27;d be paying $10/month), but had to wait like 5 hours and then I received some email from them basically demanding that I tell them what my app is, why I need email, what is the purpose of me sending email.  Maybe it&#x27;s for market research, but it didn&#x27;t come across that way.  It came across as &quot;we assume you&#x27;re a dirty spammer&quot;.

Sendgrid fail.<p>Anyway, then my friend points me over to Mandrill and I sign up.  The pricing model fit us well.. up to 12k emails free, then $0.20/thousand after that.  In the state my app is right now I probably won&#x27;t go over 12k for another few months, and once I do go over that limit I&#x27;m not going to find myself jumping suddenly to something like $80/month.<p>If I had been setting this all up just a week later (that is, now) I&#x27;d probably be on Mailgun due to this new pricing model.",1376692149

In the interest of honesty about how easily impressed I am, and because I still think it&#x27;s a neat little trick:<p>You want to generate a permutation of the entire IPv4 address space, but you don&#x27;t simply want to shuffle every possible IP address because that would require you to keep an insane amount of state. So instead, work in the multiplicative group modulo <i>p</i> for prime <i>p</i> > 2^32, find an appropriate generator, and iterate by multiplying with the generator mod <i>p</i>. Remember the prime, the generator, the starting address, and your current address and you can detect a complete traversal of the space when the starting address recurs.<p>There are a number of simpler ways to do this (after sheepishly conceding that this is pretty fundamental stuff, I played with using PRFs and card shuffling to do it; DrHoney suggested Gray codes), but I liked how immediately obvious the multiplicative group solution was, and that I could code it from a simple description.",1376691867

I was extremely pleasantly surprised by how well he portrayed the role and adopted Steve&#x27;s mannerisms. You can even see his gait and speech evolve over the course of the movie.<p>2. My fundamental problem with the film was that it tried to cram so much into two hours that a lot of scenes felt fake and over-simplified to the point of being insulting. Extreme examples of this include the &quot;I&#x27;m going to sue Bill Gates&quot; scene and the Jony Ive scene.<p>3. The beginning is stupid and irrelevant. Also, Jobs&#x27;s transition from idealistic hippy acid-dropper to steely-eyed businessman is portrayed in a manner of seconds and does not feel realistic whatsoever.<p>4.

They do this with huge low-pass filters with corner frequencies well under 1Hz, whether the charger is either linear (unlikely) or switching (much more likely).<p>When AC becomes distorted, you start seeing harmonics (i.e. contributions at higher frequencies). Low pass filters are progressively more effective at higher frequencies.

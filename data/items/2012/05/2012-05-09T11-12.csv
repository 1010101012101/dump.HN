All investments are made on speculation right now, rather than based on true value and potential for making money.<p>But if that doesn't come true, and everyone realizes this, then there will be a crash. Valuations will fall, and the initial investors won't be able to make their money back because those photo apps weren't making any revenue, let alone profits.",1336564752

3948094,comment,3946856,3947275,4,0,jules,,,"With a structured code representation (i.e. ASTs rather than flat text) this falls out naturally. The calls to foo identify foo via foo's GUID, not via the string ""foo"". So if you rename foo to bar you don't need to rename any call sites, since the GUID is still the same. Similarly, merging the branch B just works: the call to foo there is still pointing to the right foo (now called bar) via its GUID. When displaying a call to a function, the IDE looks up the name associated with the GUID.",1336564637

While coming from Python it would be easier since we already have classes, and C-structs are simply compile-time final classes without inheritance.<p>I agree though that learning Scheme can teach a lot, just not necessarily how to grok every other language well.",1336564594

3948024,comment,3947697,3947697,35,0,bhousel,,,"First.. I'm a huge fan of this stuff, and Kind of Blue is one of my favorite records.<p>That said, I think that the author is making a mistake by taking Stephen Thomas Erlewine's review too seriously.  When you read things like <i>""an album that towers above its peers, a record generally considered as the definitive jazz album, a universally acknowledged standard of excellence...""</i> take it for what it is -- fawning praise written 50 years later by a fanboy.<p>Read a bit further... <i>""this music never flaunts its genius,""</i> a line that stuck with the blogger.  In fact, anybody who knows a bit about Miles Davis is probably laughing now about how backwards this is.  Miles was Mr. Flaunty Genius.<p><i>""Kind of Blue is more than easy listening. It's the pinnacle of modal jazz""</i>... I think at this point, modal jazz was just getting started, not reaching it's pinnacle.<p><i>""...this is an exceptional band... one of the greatest in history, playing at the peak of its power. ""</i>... Um, no!  None of these musicians were at the peak of their power at all.  They all went on to do more.<p>Unfortunately now the blogger is trapped in this line of thinking, and he writes... <i>""I think what draws me to this album is the enormous restraint that each of these brilliant musicians show... They were all extraordinary musicians at the top of their games, and yet they came together and produced a piece of work that doesnt feel strained or over the top. There is a sense of comfort  of rightness  to every note on the album.""</i>...  In fact, there are other critics that have said that Cannonball Adderley was really a wrong choice for Kind of Blue - his playing stands out as being too bluesy and he didn't really ""get"" the modal jazz like the other musicians.<p>Anyway, I guess my point is to be wary of empty praise.  The author was clearly moved by the music, and the Erlewine review reinforced those feelings, but he is missing out on a lot of interesting lines of criticism that might bring him new insights.  Jazz, like other abstract arts, is especially interesting because of how <i>malleable</i> it can be, with each listener bringing their own perspectives and opinions into how they perceive the work.  The best ones (and Kind of Blue is among them) will grab your attention, play off your memories and emotions, and inspire you.",1336563013

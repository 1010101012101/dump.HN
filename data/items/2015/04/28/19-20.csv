9454758,comment,9453754,9454041,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"Why not do it at the network level? In some infrastructures this is really easy. For example in AWS you can set up all your servers in a VPC. Then put Vault on a machine on a specific subnetwork, and firewall it off such that only the machines from your VPC may access it. You have now created a walled garden where anything inside your VPC has access to the secrets without holding an authentication token, while anything outside does not.<p>Personally, I think this is your only line of defense anyways. Someone with access to your private network will likely be able to do some harm, and if they get even a non-root user on your server, it&#x27;s game over, since you are just one local exploit away from them gaining root. Remember, once they gain root on one box, it&#x27;s just a matter of time before they replace /usr/bin/sudo and /usr/bin/login with a script that emails them your password and/or steals your ssh-agent socket.",1430251189

9454756,comment,9453558,9454208,0,0,jandrewrogers,,,"It really depends on what you are doing. These days, assuming the code is well designed and highly efficient (not that common), you typically bottleneck on effective memory bandwidth or network bandwidth. To the extent this is not the case, it frequently is due to relatively poor efficiency of implementation in other parts of the system (extremely common).<p>Given a set of cheap SSDs and a good I/O scheduler, very few workloads should bottleneck on disk because the disk has more available bandwidth than the network. If you are bottlenecking on disk, it usually means the I/O scheduling is poor. The operating system I/O scheduler is quite poor for many use cases, hence why I/O intensive apps write their own.<p>Network can be inexpensively and easily saturated at 10 GbE these days, even when doing something ugly like parsing JSON streams. Unless there is a bottleneck elsewhere in the system, like memory bandwidth or occasionally CPU, this is where I typically see bottlenecks in real systems. However, switch fabrics do not scale infinitely even if you know what you are doing, so there is that, and bandwidth does not always scale linearly (though things like graph analysis are much closer to effectively linear in sophisticated implementations than you see using naive algorithms).<p>Data motion is always the bottleneck. Right now, moving from RAM to CPU or from machine to machine is almost always the bottleneck if you are doing everything else right. Many popular software designs and implementations for &quot;big data&quot; have many other bottlenecks that are not strictly necessary, so that throws off expectations e.g. poor I/O scheduling saturating disk or poor JSON parsing burning up CPU or poor use of threading wasting a lot of CPU time.",1430251154

9454752,comment,9453381,9454706,0,0,pcwalton,,,"You don&#x27;t use methods, but instead switch on the discriminant of the ADT and take different actions (such as updating local variables).<p>This is pretty related to the so-called expression problem. OO-style methods are good at extensibility, but they&#x27;re bad at adding extension points (method calls), since you have to update every one and calls are limited in expressive power compared to the body of a switch statement. Functional-style ADTs are bad at extensibility (adding a new type requires updating all pattern matches), but they&#x27;re good at adding new extension points, since you don&#x27;t have to touch the data types and pattern matching is powerful.

9454734,comment,9454184,9454184,0,0,joshstrange,,,"This is great news. Quick story:<p>A few years ago I was tasked with working on a voter management platform (used by campagins to track people, how they are voting, and calls made to them. A CRM for voters if you will). The part I was in charge of the Facebook data. The company we were working for would have parties where they got people to sign in with FB and give ALL their friends info up which we would then fetch and import into our backend. The idea here was to grab their political affiliation, interests, jobs, education (pretty much everything FB offered up) and then use that to match them to their voter records (you can get these records from the state I guess). They could then target people based on interests and the like.<p>Overall it was a neat project and my first foray into auto-scaling on AWS, event queues, and creating AMI&#x27;s (ready to go images that when launched would start consuming the queue). However after working on this for a few weeks I took a look at FB&#x27;s ToS and realized that by storing that data, planning on keeping it forever, and not giving users a way to delete the data (let alone any sort of private policy outlining what we were doing with the data) we were in violation. I brought this all to my bosses attention who more or less told me to &quot;don&#x27;t worry about it&quot; and then shortly after I was moved off the project. That project (and the company that paid us to write it) no longer exists AFAIK (which is for the better) but this would have been the nail in the coffin for them.<p>I&#x27;m really glad FB is taking this step b/c that project opened my eyes to something this article touches on which I don&#x27;t think a large number of users have considered: when you &quot;Friend&quot; someone on FB you also give them a blank check for all of the data you share with them that they can sign over to any/everyone. It&#x27;s good that FB is reigning this back in and not letting people give up access to their friends data.",1430250952

Maybe we should.<p>The split as I understood it to be defined was: Valve takes 30% (arguably OK, but I&#x27;d argue for less), Game dev gets 45% (passive income hacker, woo!) and the Mod dev gets 25%.<p>I think it would be perfectly reasonable for Mod devs to get 45% of the sales of their own mods, but Valve asked Bethesda to define the split.  What self-respecting PIH is going to give themselves or their own company less than 50%, really, if they are unilaterally the one making the decision about who gets paid and how much?<p>You are also right about one more thing, I don&#x27;t have the first idea about selling games.  But I would argue it&#x27;s more work to build EITHER or BOTH a game engine and a mod than it is to sell it.  In other words, Bethesda&#x27;s cut should not be less than Valve&#x27;s, in my humble opinion, and those mods would NOT have been for sale (or for free) without Bethesda and their game engine.<p>(Or at least, we would have entirely some other developer and game to thank for their share in this controversy.)",1430250518

Taking the vtable example -- Go code that I&#x27;ve seen uses vtabley things everywhere (the stdlib is peppered with interface types). Using vtables isn&#x27;t bad, but when you use it for stuff that could have been solved by static dispatch (for large codebases -- that can be everywhere), then it can become an issue.&quot;<p>Yes, but by definition, we&#x27;re discussing optimized code here.<p><a href=""http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=go&lang2=rust&data=u64q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/benchmark.php?t...</a><p>Yeah yeah, benchmarks blah blah, but the point here is, compare with, oh, say, this:<p><a href=""http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=perl&lang2=rust&data=u64q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/benchmark.php?t...</a><p>As I said and will repeat without blinking, Rust will always be faster than Go (and the problem in the shootout Go beat Rust on is in my opinion certainly simply an unoptimized Rust implementation, no question), but language deltas of 2x or 3x in practice are dominated by algorithms and IO far more often than 50-100x. For all the long list of reasons that Rust is faster than Go, all of which are true, they add up to much less than <i>developers are used to</i>. Intuitively, when you hear &quot;go is slower than Rust because vtables and bad optimization and GC and its pauses and interfaces&quot; you probably mentally expect Go to be like 10 times slower, when instead it&#x27;s 2-3.<p>This is relevant because I don&#x27;t think Rust advocates should sell &quot;speed!&quot; too hard as the primary thing they have... C++ will pretty much forever be able to keep up on the raw speed front, especially in benchmarks. What it has is <i>complexity management, at speed</i>. But complexity management first.... Rust could probably take a straight-up 2x speed penalty over C++ and <i>still</i> write a renderer than ran faster than C++, because it&#x27;ll be a <i>better</i> renderer.",1430249692

You can&#x27;t license a film that hasn&#x27;t been made yet unless you have a very bankable package(of stars and other talent), and you can&#x27;t easily get estimates of earning potential for other films because Netflix and other digital distributors don&#x27;t publish that stuff - it&#x27;s <i>much</i> harder to get information about the home video market compared to box office data. Licensing to broadcast or other distribution channels isn&#x27;t something that just happens automatically - there&#x27;s a huge, exacting, and expensive list of deliverables requirements, and it costs money to go to a film market or work through a sales agent. Even when everything goes smoothly, it usually takes a small picture a couple of years from when it starts looking for money to when it gets sold, and the sale often simply covers the costs of production.<p>Frankly, I don&#x27;t think you grasp the economics here very well at all. Everyone knows the existing industry paradigm is on the way out, and has known that for a good long while. The problem from the industry standpoint is that the internet/tech sector loves disrupting things but is not that smart about monetizing them - witness the large number of tech companies that don&#x27;t make a profit, and the fact that the main revenue stream for internet companies that <i>do</i> make a profit is from advertising. You know who has taken that to heart and uses that business model in the movie world? Adam Sandler. His films involve a bunch of highly-paid famous people, very cheap production, and crappy wrote-in-a-weekend stories with massive product placement opportunities, for which he takes a salary of about $20m a picture. Unlimited distribution works fine there because the film is basically an elaborate commercial, but it&#x27;s hardly a good industry model.",1430249483

Many of the wins of Servo layout have come from carefully coding to the optimizer to allow it to eliminate virtual dispatch and procedure call overhead, break apart structures, stack-allocate where possible, and (in the future) use SIMD.&quot;<p>Yes, but if that were the only concern, you wouldn&#x27;t need <i>Rust</i> to do it. C++ already exists, and it can do all those things. (Well, the &quot;break apart structures&quot; may be a bit unclean depending on exactly what you mean, but that alone wouldn&#x27;t be worth writing a new language for.) My interpretation of C++&#x27;s <i>raison d&#x27;etre</i> in modern times is &quot;zero-cost for abstractions you don&#x27;t use&quot;, whatever its heritage may have been in the past. If that were the whole story, you just would have started a new C++ renderer from scratch.<p>You need Rust because actually writing that code in C++ would be unmanageably complicated due to the ownership problems that Rust addresses. C++ is already unmanageably complicated (IMHO) when trying to write a browser engine, also requiring that level of performance would basically take it into the realm of the impossible.<p>You <i>need</i> the complexity management first. Managing the complexity buys you the cognitive budget to write the fast code, too. It is not as if the C++ render authors do not want to write fast code, or as if they are unaware of the recipe you just laid out.<p>I said I wouldn&#x27;t write it in Go because it is <i>already disqualified</i> due to the complexity issues. <i>Even if</i> I didn&#x27;t care about the performance gap, I <i>still</i> would have no desire to write a browser engine in it because it would be a nightmare, just like the C++ engines are, and for pretty much the same reasons, in addition to others. The performance gap between Rust and Go here is essentially unmeasurable, because in this task, Go won&#x27;t even cross the finish line. (By my standards, at least. I consider the C++ renderers to also not cross the finish line. The fact that memory-unsafe code can be bashed into submission with sufficient man-millenia doesn&#x27;t mean I have to agree that memory-unsafe programming languages are a good idea.)",1430248872

So, in order to be refactor friendly we decided to write feature tests to cover all of our controller actions. That way we could refactor heavily without breaking or rewriting tests much.\nIt sounded boring so I decided to make it a bit more fun by gamifying the whole task. We&#x27;re writing our controller actions onto Post It notes and putting them up on the board where the devs can grab one and when they&#x27;re done writing tests to cover those actions they can put it in a column under their name. And then in the end, I don&#x27;t know, free beers.\nThe challenge with this is that we have lots of controllers. So I wrote this gem to automate the action grouping and print out process. What this gem does is introspect on the app&#x27;s controllers, grabs all the public actions, counts their lines of code, and then groups them together so that all Post It notes have a roughly equal total lines of code.\nSo I thought that was neat and wanted to share.

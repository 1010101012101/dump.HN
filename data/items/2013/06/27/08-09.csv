Then color systems. When you master these areas, you can go to the stadium of the composition with color and form, where you will learn to draw.<p>90% of the design of an application go through the use of typography, the arrangement of elements on the screen using grid systems and interactivity of these objects. The rest is cosmetic. You can master cosmetics later learning to copy styles and practicing to the point you master them. For example, being able to illustrate, in this case, it&#x27;s a matter of drawing, not doing extreme typography use, but that&#x27;s another area of design and it will requiere grid to illustrate well, colors to give illustration deepness and etcs.<p>Go to amazon and search books on these matters, get inspired and start the selftaught process.",1372322862

But either give life, or put a cap on prison sentences at say 25 years, total, like it&#x27;s in many other countries.<p>This idea of &quot;adding&quot; sentences is ridiculous, and my guess is it&#x27;s only (ab)used as a way to force people into agreeing to declare themselves guilty, and the prosecutors going &quot;easy on them&quot; and only asking for 30 years in prison, instead of 100, if they win.<p>That&#x27;s not justice and people should be opposing this. I think it was on The Daily Show where a guest talked about a documentary called Gideon&#x27;s Army where they&#x27;re talking exactly about this issue, and how prosecutors are forcing 90% of the people arrested to admit guilt this way, before they even get a trial. So 90% go to prison without a trial!<p>It also must be very convenient that the US law is so complex now, and has gotten to the point where everyone can be incriminated with something, so basically the prosecutors can threaten just about anyone with at least a charge or two, if they want to. They must be BS charges, but lucky for them they manage to convince those people to agree with a &quot;lesser punishment&quot; before there even is a trial.

From the &quot;real world&quot; there&#x27;s things like journalist lock ins at political events which&#x27;re much the same - a voluntarily agreed upon limitation that&#x27;s not enforced by the fact that you just stepped out of a plane or descended 120 feet under the sea, but which are no less &quot;enforced&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m of the opinion that an event organiser is perfectly entitled to put these sorts of restrictions on participants ability to exit an event (within some reasonable bounds), and so long as it&#x27;s clearly enough explained before participants agree and attend, a &quot;claustrophobia-induced panic attack&quot; should be no more or less of a concern for event staff than it&#x27;d be on an international flight. The sufferer should be extended all sympathy and assistance - but the decision to &quot;break the agreement&quot; should be of the same sort of level as diverting a Sydney to San Francisco flight to Hawaii, sure you&#x27;d do it in the face of a clear and imminent medical emergency - but there&#x27;s a certain (and perhaps large) level of discomfort which passengers are rightfully expected to &quot;put up with&quot; as part of the agreement. People who&#x27;re &quot;afraid of flying&quot; and prone to panic attacks understand that, and make appropriate decisions (for them) all the time. From the article&#x27;s &quot;and it seemed that she&#x27;d happily embraced the Stockholm syndrome.&quot; it sounds to me like she accepted &quot;the rules/agreement&quot; in the end, while perhaps regretting the choice was in this case incorrect for her - the very negative use of the phrase &quot;Stockholm syndrome&quot; implies to me that she thinks the event organisers and the &quot;two goons&quot; did the right thing.<p>I&#x27;m sure other people think differently - and while I respect that different opinion - I&#x27;m not sure I agree that every event ever organised needs to cater to every possible latent bad reaction. _I_ want to be able to attend events that challenge my personal limits of comfort/security/sanity/whatever. I&#x27;m happy enough for those things to have clearly and strongly worded warnings - but I&#x27;m unhappy with someone saying &quot;that&#x27;s not a restriction imposed by a law of nature, so you can&#x27;t impose it as a requirement of an event you run&quot;.",1372321937

This is where protection against XSS/XSRF/over-posting attacks is handled as in Mvc. Only the core module is delivered as closed library. But that is more of a business layer than the security layer. The best thing about the core module is that every piece is swappable (including salted password hashing with key stretching piece) as everything is based on service pattern (interfaces and contracts).",1372320993

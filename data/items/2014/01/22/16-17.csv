Like the simple act of moving code from your head to the screen takes forever? Using Vim is a good start. But are you using it as effectively as you could be? Do you spend seconds - SECONDS! - scrolling through code? Do you manage your plugins by hand? Do you use the &quot;mouse?&quot; Check out these handy vim tips!",1390409969

No, I don&#x27;t know all the details and I wont pretend to, but ultimately, it affects the EU. The US, on the other hand, is a world away and frankly what goes on in the Ukraine is not exactly a big deal to the US or its people. Yes, on a being informed of big events in the world level, it should be reported in the US, but I can understand the US not being that interested. Im sure there are levels of concern for the US, but its a much bigger deal to us in Europe.",1390409950

7103823,comment,7101824,7102900,6,0,oso2k,,,"For one, ESR isn&#x27;t asking that the FSF change (directly).  He&#x27;s asking that FSF change with respect to GCC and the audience it serves.  There&#x27;s many developers, and especially young developers, that feel the GPL & FSF are &quot;over-principled&quot;.  I think we can all agree that &quot;Open Source&quot; has largely won.<p>But if you ask about &quot;Free Software,&quot; and take github as data point, I&#x27;d say &quot;Free Software&quot; is losing, and is losing because, like proprietary software, it&#x27;s &quot;over-principled&quot;.  Young people everywhere, &quot;feel&quot; like content, many forms of &quot;public&quot; data, and the tools to use, create, play, view, and store such content & data ought to be &quot;free as in beer&quot; (or close to it) based on the principle that the effort to copy & transfer data, content, binary, and source is &quot;almost free&quot;.  Whether there is a restriction in creating plug-ins, linking or modifying code (as in the GPL/Free Software), or copying binaries and/or content as in proprietary software, these are still restrictions.<p>This is the reason why I prefer the more permissive licenses for my works like the BSD and MIT licenses.  Essentially, my work is a gift, in the purist sense, to the entire universe.  To place restrictions on my gift is to have given the world a poison and not a gift.<p>The reason why is easier to understand when you consider the quote by Jim Warren from a 1976 ACM Programming Language newsletter [1], referencing Bill Gates&#x27; famous letter to the Homebrew Computing Club, &quot;There is a viable alternative to the problems raised by Bill Gates in his irate letter to computer hobbyists concerning &#x27;ripping off&#x27; software. When software is free, or so inexpensive that it&#x27;s easier to pay for it than to duplicate it, then it won&#x27;t be &#x27;stolen&#x27;.&quot;<p>Said another way, people will continue to do the &quot;wrong&quot; thing so long as it takes less effort than to do the &quot;right&quot; thing.  In my mind, we should be incentivizing the &quot;right&quot; things, like openness, sharing, technical merit, and capability.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC#An_early_free_software_project"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC#An_early_free_softwa...</a>",1390409914

Yes, I get that there are people substantially worse off, but they&#x27;re not getting any sympathy with crap like that.<p>Further, trying to dehumanise him with their descriptions of him as a &quot;robot&quot; and contrasting him with his child, and their use of words like &quot;evil&quot; ought to make everyone concerned.<p>This is not progressive. On the contrary, this is moronic petit bourgeois luddites staging ineffective and creepy demonstrations that will achieve nothing but play straight into the hands of their opponents.<p>It also shows that they fundamentally fail to understand the mechanisms they are fighting. Everyone on the other side will see what <i>they</i> are doing as perfectly reasonable. They are just &quot;hacking the system&quot; and following consequences. The moment they are described as &quot;evil&quot; and faced with personal demonstrations, these guys start creating enemies, when they could instead have searched for partners.<p>But these clowns use socialist terms while they clearly don&#x27;t understand much of its basis. Marx, for example, was very clear in his agitation <i>against</i> the kind of moronic vilification demonstrated in this text: The typical capitalist, and those aiding him, according to Marx, is no more evil than the worker he oppresses - capitalist and worker alike for the most part are trapped in the same machine, and have little choice but to stick to their roles: A capitalist that stops exploiting labour will fail, and end up a labourer by necessity himself. Marx was not against the capitalist. He was not even against the capitalist system per se - on the contrary, he realised that for any chance of socialism to succeed, it would be _essential_ to bring about the economic development and automation required to be able to meet the needs of everyone.<p>In fact, socialism as an idea is a child of the industrial revolution more than anything: It arose out of the hope that the industrial revolution would bring about such wealth that poverty could finally be beaten, Marx held that the capitalist system would play out its role once production had reached such a height that poverty could be eradicated.<p>Socialism originated as an ideology deeply intertwined with a positive view of technology and automation as tools of liberation.

If you do that, then at least everyone will be able to see who initiates violence (and it will be the state trying to take tax money by force) Unfortunately, people are wired to fight individuals, because it&#x27;s easy to identify them and see some actual paths to fight them. And most people reject the idea that they don&#x27;t need rulers to make peace and order. Until they keep believing that, they will keep fighting and losing these battles against their owners.

Our main goal at LavaSend is to protect our users, and in that respect case law on the use of screenshots is sketchy at best. No digital record of the conversation exists after the requested conditions are met for deletion to be subpoenaed by a court of law.<p>Q: What is the problem you are solving?\nA: The problem being solved is being able to send a document to another person without fear that the document can be used against you, mainly in a court of law. In the example of a lawyer, they can send their client documents for review without those documents being subject to legal data retention laws.  I also foresee LavaSend being used in ways we never expected or intended.

I agree it&#x27;s an important and unsolved topic, and I myself still have a few old OpenBSD posters from my teenage years :)<p>Having grown up in a family of &quot;starving artists&quot; like they say, I see a lot of parallels between open-source development and, say, music, painting, dancing etc. There are many people who produce art as a &quot;gift&quot; to society, without financial motives. This almost always comes with a tension between the quality and intensity of your work and how you will earn a living. Perhaps you have the luxury of not requiring payment for your work, because you have another source of income - but then you might be limited in the time and energy you can invest in your art. Or conversely, you wish to focus your entire time and energy on your work, but find out that securing funding from your artistic work (whether royalties, donations, salary or grants) quickly becomes a job of its own - it is common for artists to feel that the grind of securing money for their work has become their primary job. Some discover they have a knack for it, or just get lucky, and find immense commercial success. There is a commonly held notion that commercial success is inversely proportional to intrinsic artistic value. But of course it&#x27;s hard to know for sure since that is such a subjective thing to measure. Is Justin Bieber&#x27;s art &quot;less good&quot; than the local rock band I watched last night? It depends who you ask :)<p>So why is it difficult for artists, sometimes immensely talented and critically appreciated artists, to secure funding? Obviously a complex and immense question. In some societies the notion of paying someone for art is inexistant, because everyone produces art on a daily basis as part of their culture. In our society, it is accepted to pay for art as a service, but only to a point, and following rules that can be hard to decipher because they rely on guessing other people&#x27;s emotions, like fashion or the capital markets.<p>At the end of the day, I think part of the problem is that art, like writing open-source code, is an enjoyable activity.

Samsung did some very shady ripping off the iPhone in those models, so it wouldn&#x27;t be surprising if they managed to infringe on Apples&#x27; patent even taken very narrowly and specifically.<p>The usual arguments against patent trolling don&#x27;t apply to Apple v.

The reasoning \nbehind their venture was that updating and then printing \nnew blueprints took a few days and slowed construction \ntime. With this new product, construction companies \ncould create condominiums, malls, and subdivisions with \nthe least possible delay and the maximum profit. In praise \nof his prodigious business acumen, the administration-run \nUC Berkeley News decided to run an article on him in 2003, \nchampioning his ability to make money and enable the \nhousing bubble that was just starting to expand.&quot;<p>&quot;The proposed project is a testament to the arrogance, \ndisconnection, and luxury of the ruling class.

As he descended the stairs with the baby, his eyes  were on the tablet through the prism of his Google Glasses,  not on the life against his chest.

I&#x27;m <i>assuming</i> (and I certainly could be wrong, here) that this is the basis for your &quot;3rd biggest&quot; comment. But it&#x27;s not really true. Even if you exclude long, ongoing events that aren&#x27;t really single &quot;wars&quot;, like the Mongol conquests, there are still some astonishingly deadly events farther in the past.<p>The An Lushan Rebellion is the one that amazes me the most, personally. It&#x27;s one of the deadliest wars in history by absolute death toll, and since it happened so long ago (in the 8th century), that means it killed a huge portion of the world population at the time. The <i>low</i> estimates for deaths in that war amount to 5.5% of the population of the entire planet. The high estimate is over 15% of the world population.<p>And it&#x27;s not the only one that rivals the World Wars. The Taiping Rebellion killed 20-100 million. And, well, you can see the list above. It&#x27;s amazing how many of these things involve China. I mean, that&#x27;s where all the people were, and thus the greatest potential for killing them, but even so it seems a bit excessive.",1390406860

Obviously, sucks a lot to be dude, but no one is being violent (though some of the rhetoric veers toward threats, which is absolutely inappropriate), and this strategy puts immense pressure on Google. Additionally he&#x27;s well-chosen as a target: quite wealthy, working on a product that&#x27;s closely linked to military applications, and unluckily enough (for him) someone involved in the changing urban landscape of Berkeley, which helps protestors tap into a channel of great resentment. It&#x27;s a tactic that&#x27;s typically been used against CEOs in the past (e.g. after the Bhopal disaster): using it against someone lower on the totem poll makes me a bit uncomfortable, but it seems like a natural extension.<p>The real WTF is this: what the hell are they hoping to accomplish? Everything in their manifesto is scattershot, and comes off as just a spray of resentment. I could maybe imagine a demand for Google to cease all contracts with the US military, but (1) they failed to make that demand the explicit focus and (2) they&#x27;ve not laid the groundwork for that demand. You don&#x27;t jump into harsh escalations until you&#x27;ve built a community organized around the demand, but few people have heard of the Google car-military connection. The goal seems more just to express inchoate anger at Google and gentrification without having some specific outcome in mind.<p>So, on strategy I give them an F. Tactics a B, mostly because the execution is flawed because of an absent strategy, leading to their manifesto reading as frothing rage than an intelligent indictment of him and Google.

It&#x27;s much better organized than the PS layer model, CSS gives you tremendous reach with your changes (especially with SASS/LESS), and Developer Tools (or Firebug) give you amazing reactivity.<p>However, that being said, the designer must have both design skills and coding skills, which aren&#x27;t, and shouldn&#x27;t both be a requirement for the position. The most creative and best graphic designers <i>tend</i> to not know code well enough to become more efficient with it than their traditional layout tools.<p>The best middle ground for &quot;thinking for UI&quot; and quality graphic design is Sketch. Sketch eliminates 80% of the stuff you never use in PS for web design and adds the features you didn&#x27;t know you wanted. Its styling options reflect the styling options of CSS. I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.<p>Honestly, unless you have some very complex personnel issues, every web designer should be using Sketch over Photoshop (and maybe use Photoshop for image manipulation).",1390406633

Let&#x27;s send these immigrants a message.&quot; Disturbing, terrifying, and misguided.",1390406456

Am I privileged?<p>I couldn&#x27;t afford a fancy high end college, so I chose a cheaper one and got a loan from the Government, which I paid back in full.<p>I studied hard in a public school and those achievements helped me get a grant to offset some cost as well.<p>I got a job in tech support, worked my way up through the ranks by pushing myself and going above and beyond every day.<p>I continually educate myself with classes and books that I pay for out of my own pocket, and invest my own time to keep my skills sharp and advance myself.<p>I am a &quot;tech worker&quot; and I have a job that pays well above average, so am I privileged? I would like to know what was handed to me that couldn&#x27;t have been given to anyone else who worked hard. I&#x27;m not a rarity: tens of thousands of people in the tech industry are exactly like me. They saw a target and they hit it.<p>That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t support these idiots. It&#x27;s an idea full of fallacies. They&#x27;re just trying to ruin the lives of hard working mid level people based on perceived wrongs by their bosses by people with nothing better to do.",1390406420

Now what value can Windows deliver on top of that?&quot;<p>It depends on your definition for &quot;value&quot; here. For instance, for me &quot;value&quot; would be to create content in a comfortable way even if I am offline. So, since I can&#x27;t edit a video, develop an app or edit a photo being offline during my commute to work, it is very unlikely that I will get one, and hence they have very limited value &quot;to me&quot;.",1390406408

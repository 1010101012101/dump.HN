Add to that a few decades of regulation cruft, and you have a recipe for dissatisfaction.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the solution is, but I&#x27;ve always favored erring on the side of advancing vehicle technology. Just imagine what racing would look like if an eccentric billionaire created a league with only the following three rules:<p>1. If a human controls the vehicle, it must be by remote control. (This eliminates driver casualties while encouraging exciting maneuvers.)<p>2. There is a 10cm speed bump at both the entrance and exit of pit lane. (This discourages technologies that are unworkable on normal roads.)<p>3. At the end of every race, any team can purchase the winning vehicle for $500,000. (This rule keeps costs low.)<p>I think you&#x27;d quickly get some very interesting vehicle designs. For starters, F1-banned technologies such as 6 wheels[1] and suction devices[2] would get a fair shot. New drivetrains would be tried, including electric motors powered by gas turbine-cranked generators. The whole enterprise would be quite different, but it would definitely be safer and cheaper.

9756960,comment,9756612,9756861,0,0,lgbr,,,"> Germany -> Car loving country with a highly efficient railway system, and a well serviced road system as well. So it should be achievable.<p>Germany has a highly efficient railway system and the country is so small that I can cross the entire country in a day, and still, I take the car everywhere I go.<p>I think what some people miss is this: Trains are just worse.<p>They&#x27;re slow, not because they don&#x27;t have a high top speed, but they have to stop so much that their average speed is just worse than a car&#x27;s. I think there&#x27;s a couple city pairs (Berlin <-> Frankfurt) where if I was racing a train I would lose by some small margin to one of the non-stop trains, but not by much, and this would only be a true win if on my trip I was going from one city center to another city center, which I&#x27;m never doing.<p>They&#x27;re still really expensive. Air travel around Germany is always cheaper, and so is the cost of fuel for most cars. You can sometimes find a discount on the train, but those travel at pretty inconvenient times and are quite rare anymore.<p>They leave only so often. So unlike a car, I can&#x27;t just set off whenever is convenient for me. I have to find a train that leaves when I want and make sure I get to it on time. So if you live in Frankfurt and want to go visit family outside of Munich for the weekend, leaving after work at 18:00 on a Friday you&#x27;re going to end up sleeping in a train station in Bavaria overnight as opposed to a car which can continue driving after 12:00 unlike a rural train.<p>And they never get where I want. For half of the places I regularly travel, when I get there, I need to have someone pick me up with a car or I need to rent a car. There just are no other choices. As densely populated as this country is, it&#x27;s just still really difficult to get to a huge portion of the country with public transit.<p>I really find it no wonder the US does not have a decent passenger train system. Every single one of these problems is hugely exacerbated by its sparse population to the point where passenger trains just aren&#x27;t feasible.",1434962310

Geopolitically speaking it&#x27;s very convenient (and maybe reasonable) to act as if every state is a &quot;sovereign state&quot;, but it&#x27;s not[0]. The submarine (along with a long series of obscure deals involving bribery, etc.) were strongly supported (almost imposed) by Germans as a bargain.<p>> It also seems like there&#x27;s a lot of corruption and irresponsible financial policy.<p>That&#x27;s true. There&#x27;s no beating around the bush, since 1990 spending has been reckless. Basically the EUR gave a free-card access to credit.<p>The entire pension system should be re-structured but at the same time the base salary should be brought up and not down. Young people can not find jobs and they absolutely can not sustain families.<p>The current system is extremely twisted: Usually the elderly of the family receive (well used to receive, before the crisis) boosted pensions with which they support the younger members of the family who are unemployed or underpaid. The fact that the young population has &quot;access&quot; to elderly&#x27;s money is the only reason you don&#x27;t see riots around though.<p>The problem is that the reforms already made, slashed a huge chunk of the household&#x27;s income while not giving anything back (not even hope!) in return. That&#x27;s why in the end of the day, the majority which suffered from this cuts, is not likely to accept any more reforms.<p>According to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;: &quot;main pensions have been slashed 44 to 48 percent since 2010, reducing the average pension to 700 euros a month … About 45 percent of Greek pensioners receive less than 665 euros monthly — below the official poverty threshold.&quot;<p>> All of these facts together give the impression that Greece isn&#x27;t committed to doing the right thing.<p>The problem (for Greeks) is that every single reform imposed by the Troika (or institutions or whatever) are always for the worse and never for the better. After 7 years of implementing reforms dictated from the Troika, I think we can rest assured that they&#x27;re reform schedule was a failure which drove the public upwards incredibly AND creating a humanitarian crisis.<p>Greece needs a &quot;New Deal&quot;[1] or a &quot;Marshal Plan&quot;. But there&#x27;s no Roosevelt or G. Marshall around, unfortunately. Again, you&#x27;re taking for granted that the Troika wanted to &quot;help&quot; Greece, but that&#x27;s far and away from the feeling I have looking at the facts at hand.

If the difference really is &quot;miniscule,&quot; why isn&#x27;t it covered in Greece&#x27;s proposals?<p>And why are those proposals, like eliminating Greece&#x27;s very early retirement, only being made now? Greece&#x27;s average retirement age is purportedly 61, with some people retiring as early as 50. Meanwhile Germany and Spain raised their retirement age to 67 and have discussed 69. It&#x27;s completely understandable to me that their taxpayers who will work until 67 do not wish to fund these pensions.<p>It tells me something that Yanis suggests fixing the pension system now in this 11th hour proposal. If Greece was seriously committed to fiscal responsibility, the government would have done this of their own accord long ago, right? By including this as part of the &quot;deal&quot;, presumably it will allow the Greek government to say it was &quot;forced&quot; on them, rather than taking responsibility and making a sovereign decision, independent from any new agreements with third parties, to do the right thing and institute policy that will allow their government and pension system to be solvent.",1434961620

Or if they had, approach time was 2-3x more compared to dangerous walking along the road... that&#x27;s just plain wrong).<p>That said... trains are expensive. No, EXPENSIVE. Swiss have probably best rail system in the world, with train stations being central point of most towns and villages. Buses are just complementary where putting up rail track would be ridiculous (hardcore mountain areas, desolate places with very few people living). But Suisse is small, and wealthy. Not sure about actual cash flow government -> SBB (rail company), but tickets are expensive like hell. Cost wise even for single person road costs same (albeit sometimes it&#x27;s faster by car, depends), when more people come, car is much cheaper (and convenient). Never been to japan, so no clue how well known Shinkanzen are integrated with more local transport.<p>Thanx to freaking unions for steady high prices, but not only them. When moving between densely populated areas, trains compete with planes, not cars (and planes are sometimes much cheaper, sometimes faster, sometimes not). If in future we&#x27;ll get trains moving steadily over 500 km/h, that would be a proper time saving advantage over longer distances. Airports became such a time and energy drain, with ridiculous and annoying security measures that most probably doesn&#x27;t work anyway, just hikes the price and takes time.<p>Let&#x27;s not forget fragility of rail network, any delay/accident can have massive cascading effect that stretches far across network, much more compared to cars and planes (well, here it&#x27;s more complicated for those with connecting flights)",1434961613

The distance from NYC to LA has absolutely nothing to do with the inability of Americans to build a high speed rail link between various Eastern and Southern cities, and there is zero plausibility to any claim that NYC and Chicago (or Dallas) aren&#x27;t commerical hubs of comparable importance to the US as Bejing and Hong Kong are to China.<p>So we can put that false claim to bed now, and never muddy the discussion with it again.<p>The more plausible reason is the other one you cite, at least by implication: the American economic and political system, uniquely amongst developed democracies, is unable to muster sufficient collective resources in the form of public or private investment to enable creators to build a fairly straightforward rail network that would serve American economic needs.<p>The US is not &quot;the most technologically advanced coutry in the world&quot;. It is <i>two</i> countries, one of which is technologically advanced, the other of which is backward in almost every respect (and kept that way by policies set by the first.)<p>Until Americans figure out how to deal with their unique social and political deficits and inabilities they will continue to suffer under stub-standard conditions in almost every respect. They will continue to die earlier, live with higher crime rates, lousy railways, and dramatically lower economic efficiency than that enjoyed by citizens of almost any other advanced nation.<p>Canada also sucks with respect to passenger rail, and we are generally far better than Americans at solving our collective problems, so there may be more to it than that, but clearly size alone is not the issue, or China wouldn&#x27;t have the amazing high speed rail network it does.",1434960895

In fact, they&#x27;re entirely illegal, there&#x27;s just a gray area when it comes to a few soft drugs (pretty much just weed now - and I believe truffles in some head shops possibly... but no longer mushrooms.) Bringing weed into the country: still technically illegal. Other drugs: very much illegal. Regarding drug law, I would suggest looking to Portugal as a closer representation to that perfect utopia.<p>Regarding prostitution, I don&#x27;t know enough to have much of a personal opinion on whether legalisation would help.<p>I used to think very strongly that it would. Last year I visited (as a tourist, not as a customer) Europe&#x27;s largest brothel [0], in Germany, and came away with the opinion that if people are going to pay for sex, in a legal system like this is the best way for it. And I still see the benefits, but I&#x27;ve also since read up a little and found out many of the girls in that brothel were still trafficked over, still have pimps, etc.<p>But... don&#x27;t be too quick to jump to one conclusion or the other. Maybe the NL situation would be better if the entire world also legalised it? Maybe there are different ways of doing it to the way NL has done it.

I&#x27;m incredibly thankful to everyone involved in the medical profession -- doctors, nurses, techs, researchers, pharmaceuticals, everyone who has helped my son be healthy and happy.  But one thing I&#x27;ve learned is that they&#x27;re not always right.<p>Don&#x27;t allow doctors and nurses to make decisions about your child&#x27;s healthcare without running them through your sanity filter.  Something as routine as a blood draw can be very traumatic for both child and parent -- you&#x27;ll be in the position of physically restraining your child while he or she screams in horror.  Usually the doctors and nurses know what they&#x27;re doing.  But sometimes they&#x27;re faced with complex choices and they face these choices without knowing anything about your child&#x27;s personality.  They&#x27;ll often err on the side of caution, and usually they&#x27;re right, but it&#x27;s your job to ask the questions to make sure of this.  You are your child&#x27;s only real advocate -- everyone else is just doing his/her job, sometimes well and sometimes not so well, though virtually always well-intentioned.<p>I&#x27;ve been in the situation of arguing (politely) with a physician in an ER because he didn&#x27;t have a good reason for ordering some tests for my boy.  I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s great at his job, and on adults these tests are basically (emotionally) free, but I don&#x27;t take inducing terror in my son lightly so they&#x27;re not free by my reckoning.  I ended up getting him to call my son&#x27;s primary care physician, who agreed with me and recommended the tests not be done.  I&#x27;m pretty sure we would have walked out without the tests anyway, because he couldn&#x27;t give a sound reason for the tests.

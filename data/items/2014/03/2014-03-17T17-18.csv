7416760,comment,7415921,7415921,1,0,clienthunter,,,"The absurdity of this kind of thought is just profound.  Thinking like this may be useful as a means of encouraging hope when all hope is lost, but Bitcoin is nowhere near there yet.  Most of all this kind of talk smacks of <i>deep desperation</i> - &quot;why won&#x27;t people love me?&quot;<p>I understand fully why one might feel so desperate.  Bitcoin may have the potential to be truly revolutionary.  Bitcoin solves the problem of orchestrating an international currency in a manner that limits the implementation details to the design, not banking/payment industry/political types who historically - for one reason or another - end up building in significant <i>rigidities</i> to the system.<p>It doesn&#x27;t take a PhD in Economics to see the potential benefits of eradicating PayPal and consumer banks (although it may take one to see the potential pitfalls).  More than this though, Bitcoin opens the door to truly free capital flow.  It is possible to work in the Western world for a month or two and move, say, far East, and live like a king on the savings for a year or more.  Why can&#x27;t we just buy the stuff over there cheaply and consume it at home?  One major reason is the rigidities in capital flow - it is hard, risky business in the current system.  As a large company in a Bitcoin world you don&#x27;t have to worry about a great class of risks of international trade, dumping money into the Cambodian economy is no longer a question of FX risk and &quot;can I get it back out?&quot;<p>This is a great step forward on the way to homogenising international capital stores i.e. <i>ceteris paribus</i>, rich people buy where things are cheapest, like in Cambodia, thereby flowing capital to, and driving up prices in, Cambodia.  Cambodians get richer and the West gets poorer.  Bitcoin has the vague potential to be the great equalizer.<p>We have seen some evidence of this at work in the EU with the Euro, if you look past the troubling dynamics of transition.  Imagine how very different the US would be if every state had a different currency and payment processing rules, the diversity in income would be profound.<p>An educated economist will see a great many problems with this utopian vision, but will likely agree the aim is noble and that the basis - Bitcoin - is the closest thing we have so far to a workable solution.<p>Bitcoin may be as revolutionary as the fanboys want it to be, even if they don&#x27;t understand why.  My personal thought is that Bitcoin will soon be seen as the thing that started it all, but the solution won&#x27;t be Bitcoin itself. There are too many problems - no matter how many times you read that a fixed supply currency is the greatest thing since sliced bread, it <i>really</i> isn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s also woefully easy to steal and the mining/verification mechanism is far too resource intensive and encouraging of looney speculation making its value at any point in time completely impossible to reason about.<p>If you love BTC today, don&#x27;t spout bullshit strings of meaningless words in some grandiose display of being ahead of the times.  Make it stronger and better because if you don&#x27;t history will judge this whole thing very severely in 10 years time, when it really is just a way of buying drugs and hitmen.",1395079014

If three people give you roughly the same reply you can reply to all three posts at once.

But except for the queen the soldiers and workers are all almost completely interchangeable within their class.<p>Humans, needless to say, are <i>not</i> completely interchangeable.

But this reacts more to the needs of the group than to the abilities of the people, and doesn&#x27;t scale to boot.<p>Then you have groups like Valve that try to enforce a flat org. structure and you end up instead evolving informal org. structures as before (since being flat implies being interchangeable).

7416657,comment,7416189,7416189,14,0,rjknight,,,"<i>The problem with management isn’t managers, the problem with management is bad managers.</i><p>So, on the one hand, we have what we might call the <i>Lord of the Flies</i> narrative - that Github&#x27;s pseudo-anarchic non-management just enables people&#x27;s worst traits to come to the surface; it doesn&#x27;t remove power imbalances, it just hides them and makes it harder to challenge illegitimate use of that power because it&#x27;s harder to identify.<p>On the flip side, we have what we might call the <i>Milgram Experiment</i> narrative - that authority positions are naturally corrupting, making belief in good management seem utopian; sure, we&#x27;d all like to be managed by someone that we respect, admire and trust, but we&#x27;re just as <i>likely</i> to be managed by someone that we fear, pity or loathe, and the explicit hierarchy turns out to be just as hard to challenge as the implicit one and often even more so.<p>Lots of people seem to have decided that one of the above is the greater evil, and are willing to risk the other.  Github is in the minority of companies that (hitherto) has seen the latter as the greater evil, or at least that is how the company has presented itself (I don&#x27;t work there and don&#x27;t personally know anyone who does, so I really can&#x27;t comment on anything other than the rhetoric).<p>What we need is, boring though this may seem, some kind of balance between the two.  In an anarchic company, people are going to over-step the boundaries (e.g. by reverting a co-workers commits due to a personal dispute).  Some authority needs to police this.  However, that authority only really needs to be reactive - it should punish wrongdoers rather than order people around on a daily basis.  Most of the time, people do the right thing and can be left to get on with it, and hassling them while they do it is harmful.<p>To get overly philosophical, I think we can have the best of both worlds by borrowing the concept of &#x27;complex equality&#x27;[1], which comes from the book <i>Spheres of Justice</i> by Michael Walzer[2].  In a nutshell, he suggests that we can avoid power imbalances by ensuring that natural and legitimate imbalances within different &#x27;spheres&#x27; do not spill over into other ones.  In the context of tech companies, we might have, say, a &#x27;discipline&#x27; sphere where managers are in charge, a &#x27;technical&#x27; sphere where engineers are in charge, a &#x27;design&#x27; sphere with designers in charge, and so on.  Being the top engineer doesn&#x27;t give you the right to overrule a designer on a design question, and being a top manager doesn&#x27;t give you the right to overrule an engineer on a technical question.  If we&#x27;re dealing with a personal conflict, this falls under the jurisdiction of management, and they should have full authority to resolve it.  If we&#x27;re dealing with a technical debate, that should be resolved by engineers.  Resource allocation should be handled as democratically as possible.<p>Once you think in this way, it becomes obvious why some companies and projects fail: managers demanding authority over technical matters (e.g. estimates, software development workflow), engineers demanding authority over design (I&#x27;m sure we can all think of examples), or anyone demanding authority over management practices.  These are all likely to lead to abuse and mismanagement; in any case they are unlikely to be optimal.  What companies need <i>is</i> formal structure, but structure that <i>constrains</i> authority rather than simply entrusting it to managers and thereafter hoping that they turn out to be, against the odds, good ones.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_equality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_equality</a>\n[2] I am <i>dimly</i> aware that Walzer is controversial in some circles. I know nothing about him apart from the book, so please do not take anything I say as an endorsement or condemnation of any of his other views, which are beside the point here.",1395078248

If you want to measure speed, you have to measure distance, which eventually comes down to the magnitude of the vector between two points - subtract the X&#x27;s, subtract the Y&#x27;s, subtract the Z&#x27;s. Problem is, at cosmic scales, expansion means that those two points aren&#x27;t in the same reference frame, because more space has appeared between them. You can try to measure it, but by the time you do the axes themselves have stretched again. The two X&#x27;s can&#x27;t be subtracted directly anymore, because they&#x27;re on different reference frames.

In the end we just often buy inferior products (in design, functionality and longevity) in order to be able to purchase a larger total number of unnecessary items.

I do, however, make nearly twice the median household income. My mortgage consumes approximately one-quarter of my after-tax income.<p>But $200 is definitely a significant amount of money to me. Nearly all my money is spent on necessities - by which I mean food, electricity, medical, propane, gas, household and car repairs, etc. I am left over with a few hundred dollars a month in &quot;spending&quot; money, of which I prefer to save at least half. I am definitely not spending that in an endeavor to comfort myself with a bunch of junk.<p>But it would take some serious consideration and a really, really good reason for me to spend an extra $200 on a product. There must be some extra use case extremely important to me to justify spending an extra $200 - just better design or some bonus functionality is not sufficient. That said, I do take longevity into account - I am typing this on a nearly 8 year old Dell laptop - because I try to look at the total cost, and buying a replacement factors into that.<p>In my experience, people either do what I do, or just give up altogether and buy cheap because that&#x27;s all they can afford and its Good Enough.<p>It&#x27;s difficult for me to even fathom having the attitude that &quot;if you can&#x27;t spend $200 more, you don&#x27;t need it.&quot; I would argue that I do &quot;need&quot; a tablet (as far as anyone does) - I travel frequently and it would be very nice to have, and even when I am at work I walk around a lot.

While the people on there, mostly developers of various clones, had plenty to say about the issues with NetHack, including its code, one thing they did agree on: NetHack is a game about exceptions. What makes it fun is exactly what makes the code is damn terrible; that is, every interaction between any two or more objects is a series of if/else if statements. For example, you can dip an object into another object if it&#x27;s a potion, a fountain, a sink. If you dip it into a fountain, you may summon a jinni, or the fountain might dry up. If you dip a potion into another potion, you might make a new potion; or dilute the original; or bless or curse the original. Or you might create an explosion. This is a <i>simple</i> example with mostly straightforward rules. Things like interactions between thrown objects and their targets are more subtle but more complex. This is why I play NetHack: because the complexity makes it fun. A simpler game like 2048 can also be fun, but it&#x27;s predictable. NetHack is different every time you play it.",1395077687

I was young when it happened, probably 19-20, and an older woman I worked with made constant unwanted sexual advances. We worked unsupervised in a two person team in a group home, and for about six months she would never let a day go by without pointing out that she would be willing to engage in intercourse with me, right here and now, in pretty graphic terms. I was pretty low on the totem pole, the woman harassing me was very good friends with management, and so I never did anything about it.<p>So yes, I have been in a situation like that, can imagine the reality, and would totally be willing to go through it again and do it right by reporting it and maybe saving others from getting that treatment in the future.",1395077018

There&#x27;s no fundamental reason why LINQ to Objects should be any slower than say a foreach over a set.  You can get is a mess with either approach.  If you&#x27;re not prepared to mentor your team, or do code reviews to check for problematic usage then it&#x27;s a fault of yours, not the technology.<p>> It doesn&#x27;t matter to you, probably because you don&#x27;t even know what the cost is [and that isn&#x27;t meant to be at all a slam.

This is a step beyond simply being disinterested in dividends and buybacks in the near term, but you seem to be confusing the two.<p>Anyone who purchased shares at that point would be doing so because of one of the following\n1) They believe that Page, Brin and Schmidt will change their minds\n2) They believe that control will be wrested away from Page, Brin and Schmidt by more buyback/dividend friendly management\n3) They believe that other people will still buy for reasons 1,2, or 3. This is classic Keynes Beauty Contest investing.<p>GOOG could still grow its revenues, but if it is guaranteed to never pay a dividend or buy back stock (Berkshire Hathaway doesn&#x27;t pay dividends but Buffett has said he would definitely pursue share buybacks under certain conditions) or sell its assets, then there is no way to get cash out of GOOG except by trading with other beauty contest investors. The only thing left to anchor GOOG stock value to Google the company is the possibility of bankruptcy.<p>So yetanotherphd is 100% correct.

I cringe whenever I read &quot;oh it&#x27;s new technology of course people will be scared!&quot; or worse yet, &quot;you must be jealous because you didn&#x27;t get in on the ground floor.&quot; I think it&#x27;s a really cool technology but the economics don&#x27;t make a lot of sense. There are a few major issues I see:<p>-What problem does it solve? Many claim that it&#x27;s a more efficient way to transfer money, but after paying high spreads & fees on illiquid exchanges or a place like coinbase, it doesn&#x27;t look so good. International wires are expensive but paying 30 bps each way in exchange fees plus enormous spread concessions to trade even relatively small amounts like $1mm USD are much more expensive.<p>-What backs it other than speculation? Scarcity itself does not imply value. I don&#x27;t see a significant &quot;bitcoin economy&quot; out there. Yes, you can buy things with them, but most of these things are priced in dollars. Sellers are accepting bitcoins only because they can sell them for USD, EUR, etc. to speculators. They have no particular attachment to bitcoins themselves and could just as easily accept another crypto currency provided speculators were active enough in the market. How many people are paid a salary or renting an apartment for a <i>fixed</i> amount of BTC per month?<p>-Many bad actors in the market with little regulation. There have been numerous scams and untrustworthy exchanges out there. It&#x27;s like taking a trip back to the depression-era bucket shops.<p>-Consumer unfriendly: the average &quot;man on the street&quot; can&#x27;t secure his wallet file and even many technically sharp people have been ripped off. Non-reversible transactions aren&#x27;t a positive for most users and requiring traders to use an escrow service further increases costs. Network can&#x27;t handle high transaction volumes and sellers need to wait for confirmations or risk fraud, so the use case of everyone buying their morning coffee with bitcoin seems shaky.<p>-Extreme volatility and lack of liquidity make it a poor store of value or unit of record, two things that are extremely important in a currency. Yes most government issued currencies experience inflation, but I can keep my paycheck in the bank for months or years without its value changing wildly, and I know what a loaf of bread costs in USD within a tight range.<p>Some of these are fixable and I see some growth potential in micropayments or as a money transfer mechanism for people who don&#x27;t have access to traditional financial institutions, but what is the general purpose use case? What can I do with bitcoin that I can&#x27;t with paypal or even a bank account (many let you instantly transfer money these days for no/low fees to pay friends, landlords, etc.)?",1395076226

I am probably a sloppy thinker and possibly a very bad one, but luckily I&#x27;ve received some very good education, and in this particular case I didn&#x27;t even need to think at all. I simply informed readers that by modern definitions of sexism, absence of women from places of influence <i>equals</i> sexism (at least somewhere in society if not at a particular workplace). I am certainly not invested in this... oh, wait, actually, you&#x27;re right, I am – I&#x27;m a feminist (or, at least, I&#x27;d like to be) and I want to live and work in a more egalitarian society. If you take any issue with this thinking, I&#x27;m kindly pointing you to the last 50 years of research in history, sociology and anthropology and the relevant researchers. Take it up with them (but don&#x27;t tell them they&#x27;re emotional as they&#x27;ll take offense because, you know, they&#x27;re emotional).<p>And, again, I&#x27;m sorry for my sloppy thinking, but I believe that &quot;consider whether there is discrimination against Down Syndrome sufferers amongst tenured faculty on math departments&quot; is not a <i>counterexample</i> because pertinent disability most certainly doesn&#x27;t fall under any definition of sexism/racism and other unfair discrimination (same goes for quadriplegics in the NBA).

However, that, too, would not fall under the modern definition for racism, as racism (like sexism) is &quot;prejudice + power&quot;, and I don&#x27;t think anyone suggests white men lack power or influence in American sports.<p>And if I was sloppy by not qualifying the term &quot;a well defined group of people&quot; to exclude disability, forgive me, I thought it was patently clear from the context, namely a discussion on women. And please don&#x27;t try to counter with discrimination against those who don&#x27;t know programming or village idiots, because the definition excludes that kind of &quot;discrimination&quot;, too, and I hope that&#x27;s clear enough without me quoting vast amounts of research verbatim.",1395076013

For most applications, malloc is fine and when you want to reduce mallocs (pushing them out of performance critical code) usually pushing stuff up the stack is the way to go.

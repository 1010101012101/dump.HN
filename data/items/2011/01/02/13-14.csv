Send your concerns to the Internal Auditing department. They (usually) have the stroke to make people sit down and take things seriously.

2060004,comment,2059798,2059798,0,0,pierrefar,,,"As the contact page and the FAQ require signing in, I can't comment on the exact implementation. I suspect they monitor Google's cache as that's the only publicly available data that can power this service. This is the wrong way to do it for many reasons:<p>1. There can be a delay between crawling and the page showing up in the cache. I've seen it to be on the order of several days in some cases, even though the page was ranking well and getting traffic!<p>2. Email is not a good log format. It's just not. I suspect for this service you'll need to enter each URL you want to monitor manually (yikes!) and then you get an email. If your sitemaps are any good, you already have a good list of your website's URLs and this could be a massive copy-paste operation, but then you'll get bombarded with emails. One time when I implemented such a system, GMail locked for days.<p>3. A much better solution is to do it server side with a proper log like in MySQL or MongoDB or whatever. You can do this with a cron job that analyzes the HTTP server's log files at the end of each day, does clever number crunching, generates a report and emails you.<p>Clever number crunching means calculating numbers that affect your business's bottom line. You can monitor percentage of pages indexed, segment by sections, do trends over time analyses, and more clever stuff like time between crawl and first Google-referred traffic.",1293976170

2060000,comment,2057704,2059444,0,0,kiscica,,,"A number of employees have one or more kids.  Off the top of my head, they live in New Jersey (commute on NJ Transit), Long Island (LIRR), upstate (Metro North), i.e. the traditional NY suburbs, as well as in Manhattan and Brooklyn; that is, pretty much the whole spectrum is represented.  In general it's safe to say that living in Manhattan is always going to involve compromises.  Manhattan apartments are small and expensive.  There's a strong tendency for families to move out to the suburbs, where there's greenery, space, and good schools.  This is helped by the relatively good commuting infrastructure; it takes some of the NJ guys less time to get to the office than it takes me to get in on the subway from our house in Brooklyn.<p>I'm a New Yorker, but I'm not a real estate maven, and it'd be hard for me to suggest specific neighborhoods without knowing the specifics of your situation.  Renting or buying?  One- or two-income household?  What do you do, what does your spouse do?  And so on.  But there are lots of options, and most of them are represented by at least one person at the company, so if you come and interview you can ask around :-)",1293975845

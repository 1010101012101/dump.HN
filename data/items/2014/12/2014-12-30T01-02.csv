8812922,comment,8812242,8812776,0,0,bjornsing,,,"> He missed the core point that the freedom to protest is important in and of itself.<p>I agree wholeheartedly. Also, I was a bit surprised that he didn&#x27;t refute the claim that you need a permit to peacefully assemble in the US. Is that really so?<p>Where I am (Sweden) you can &quot;apply for a permit weeks and months in advance&quot;, but you don&#x27;t have to. There&#x27;s nothing illegal about the peaceful assembly of a large number of people, in fact it&#x27;s a right ensured by &quot;basic law&quot; (similar to a constitution).",1419904731

But it&#x27;s just exposed because everything is right there. If you actually tried to figure out how to compile all the software on your <i>Windows machine</i>, would it be any better?<p>And to say that libtool, bloated and complex as it is, came about because someone was <i>incompetent</i> seems quite a bit insulting. It seems that confronted with a compatibility problem between different Unix-like systems, one has two choices:<p>(1) Coordinate changes to all Unix-like systems so the compatibility problem is removed, or<p>(2) Work around the problem with some sort of wrapper.<p>Now, in a perfect world, (1) is obviously the better alternative (but even that wouldn&#x27;t help existing installations.) But the world is <i>not</i> perfect, and my chances of accomplishing (1) are practically zero, even if it&#x27;s <i>&quot;just a single flag to the ld(1) command&quot;</i>. Hence, anyone who actually wants to get something working on all those systems would have to do whatever it takes.",1419904666
8812920,comment,8812242,8812530,0,0,MBCook,,,"The only times I can think of police being involved in protests are because they (at least appear) to be non-neutral.<p>When the police are the <i>target</i> of the protest, it&#x27;s pretty easy for them to appear to be on one side of the issue. If the people of Ferguson think the police don&#x27;t protect them it shouldn&#x27;t be surprising that the protestors don&#x27;t want to obey them.<p>The only other incident that comes to mind is the WTO protests in Seattle years ago. I remember the people felt like the police were being used to squash legitimate protests and suppress speech.<p>But I know other protests happen. The various fast food woke protests earlier this year would be an example. Most of the time the police are out doing stuff like stopping really rowdy people from escalating things and managing traffic. I&#x27;d imagine most of these kind of protests (large marches, etc.) are scheduled but even when they weren&#x27;t the police weren&#x27;t seen as intruding because they were perceived to be neutral.<p>That neutrality makes a <i>big</i> difference. With it the police are there to help/protect the protestors and keep things safe. Without it the police can start to feel like a military force putting down rebellion. And a crowd is going to react very differently to those two things.",1419904654

Having to allocate more bytes than the unsealed message in crypto_sign_open() was also the root cause of quite a few unfortunate bugs.<p>And even when used properly, people always ended up writing wrappers allocating temporary buffers and moving data around in order to add/trim these bytes.<p>And when people start writing wrappers, it usually means that there is something wrong with the API.<p>For this reason, libsodium fully supports the crypto_box and crypto_secretbox in a compatible way, but doesn&#x27;t document them in favor of the &quot;easy&quot; interface, which basically does what everybody was reinventing when writing wrappers for these functions.<p>How to generate nonces for each operation is described in the libsodium documentation. There are legitimate cases for having full control over the nonce, such as the dnscurve and dnscrypt protocols.<p>Some bindings such as the Swift bindings (Swift-Sodium) have the box() operation generate and return a nonce in addition to the ciphertext. Less flexible than leaving the responsibility to the developer, but definitely safer, and something that might be added to the library itself. On the other hand, adding more and more functions to do the same thing (because breaking backward compatibility is not an option) isn&#x27;t good either.",1419904222

Particularly since taxi companies are almost always local and local rules vary.<p>To go back to a specific point in the OP, if an Uber driver says that when they were a taxi driver the company&#x27;s cut was 40% instead of the 20% uber takes, I&#x27;d be inclined to think they&#x27;re not lying about it. Merely not bringing it up would be more than sufficient to maintain the illusion.<p>And to compare this to a personal experience conversing with a cab driver and an uber driver, I had a cabbie tell me that they wait a <i>month</i> to get money from debit or credit transactions in their cab from the company, and this is one of the reasons they resist customers paying that way. An uber driver told me it&#x27;s a week for them. That&#x27;s a huge difference in payment cycle.<p>Also, if Uber drivers are trapped somehow from taking their labour elsewhere, it is entirely because of the regulatory capture created by the taxi industry&#x27;s relationship with city administrations that imposes inflexible limits on the way the taxi industry can grow (often to the point of it being essentially a planned economy).",1419903689

Thank you for a most thoughtful reply.

The thing you&#x27;re forgetting is that unemployment denotes a percentage of the eligible workforce, which, in itself, is only a fraction of the total population. Before the industrial revolution, literally EVERYONE, save for infants and toddlers, had some sort of employment -- some daily task to assist their making ends meet. The long-term trend is extremely obviously one of monotonic decline of the number of jobs available per capita.<p>I&#x27;m totally aware that the consequence of technology replacing jobs is structural unemployment. Yes, over time, there will be more unemployment. It is likely that we will adapt for this by changing the definition of the eligible workforce, and by supplying further social aid (e.g. basic income) to those who are not in the workforce.<p>However, the problem with your argument is that you are putting the cart before the horse: you want basic income before you remove jobs. Instituting basic income while people still have jobs is politically well-nigh impossible. There actually must be a felt <i>need</i> for basic income, not just &quot;once y&#x27;all have basic income we can start automating away your jobs&quot;.<p>Would you have said, on the cusp of the industrial revolution, that nations should hold out on the technological progress until everyone is assured a new job and a decent quality of life?

I wouldn&#x27;t call the 215 program monitoring at all, unless you&#x27;re referring to the &quot;seed selectors&quot; that are approved by the FISC.  Based on what we know now, the entire premise of the program, which was lacking in the initial reporting, is determining if any numbers on a list of foreign phones belonging to suspected terrorists have called or received calls from US numbers; if so, which numbers were they in contact with.  You can call it massive over-collection to achieve those ends and you can say the potential for abuse is frightening, but none of the Snowden documents have actually shown any abuse, datamining or, dare I say, monitoring of regular people.<p>With your second article, it almost feels like your article and the source documents are talking about two separate things.  You start off claiming that the documents are at odds with Obama&#x27;s claim that the NSA can&#x27;t listen to American&#x27;s phone calls or target their e-mails, then go and cite a pair of documents that detail how to avoid collecting American&#x27;s communications and what to do if they are inadvertently collected?  You continue on by saying <i>&#x27;Analysts are expected to exercise &quot;reasonable judgment&quot; in determining which data to use, according to the documents, and &quot;inadvertently acquired communications of or concerning a United States person may be retained no longer than five years.&quot;&#x27;</i>, but omit rest of the paragraph that it comes from:<p><i>Personnel will exercise reasonable judgment in determining whether information acquired must be minimized and will destroy inadvertently acquired communications of or concerning a United States person at the earliest practicable point in the processing cycle at which such communication can be identified either: as clearly not relevant to the authorized purpose of the acquisition (e.g., the communication does not contain foreign intelligence information); or, as not containing evidence of a crime which may be disseminated under these procedures.  Such inadvertently acquired communications of or concerning a United States person may be retained no longer than five years in any event.  The communications that may be retained include electronic communications acquired because of limitations on NSA&#x27;s ability to filter communications.</i><p>Why is the beginning and end of that paragraph important but not the fact that NSA analysts are required to destroy any US person communications that couldn&#x27;t be automatically filtered out and contain no intelligence value or evidence of a crime?  It doesn&#x27;t say anything about a requirement to destroy American&#x27;s inadvertently collected communications anywhere in the article.  You continue by saying <i>&#x27;The documents also refer to &quot;content repositories&quot; that contain records of devices&#x27; &quot;previous Internet activity,&quot; and say the NSA keeps records of Americans&#x27; &quot;electronic communications accounts/addresses/identifiers&quot; in an apparent effort to avoid targeting them in future eavesdropping efforts.&#x27;</i>  What&#x27;s the problem with noting that an e-mail address belongs to an American if the stated purpose is to mark it as unsuitable for collection?<p>You go to quote Jameel Jaffer at the ACLU as saying that &quot;the NSA claims the authority to collect and disseminate attorney-client communications -- and even, in some circumstances, to turn them over to Justice Department prosecutors.&quot;, but the actual source document says this:<p><i>As soon as it becomes apparent that a communication is between a person who is known to be under criminal indictment in the United States and an attorney who represents that individual in the matter under indictment (or someone acting on behalf of the attorney), monitoring of that communication will cease and the communication will be identified as an attorney-client communication in a log maintained for that purpose.  The relevant portion of the communication containing that conversation will be segregated and the National Security Division of the Department of Justice will be notified so that appropriate procedures may be established to protect such communications from review or use in any criminal prosecution, while preserving foreign intelligence information contained therein.  Additionally, all proposed disseminations of information constituting United States person attorney-client privileged communications must be review by the NSA Office of General Counsel prior to dissemination.</i><p>I look at these things and I have to wonder why the article is written like this.  It seems downright misleading to me.  Is it an editorial decision, or is that how you actually interpret those documents?<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m re-reading this a few minutes later and I&#x27;m worried I&#x27;m coming off as offensive, which wasn&#x27;t my intention.  I&#x27;m honestly curious about this - I read those same source documents and interpret them completely different than how you wrote them up.",1419901219

8812755,comment,8810297,8812368,0,0,the_af,,,"I like Scala (and I&#x27;m starting to use it in my day job!) but I don&#x27;t really think IDEA tooling is &quot;roughly Java-level&quot; quality. In fact, all the Scala IDEs I&#x27;ve tried are astonishingly bad, IntelliJ included.<p>The consensus among the more knowledgeable Scala programmers at my office is that IntelliJ is too quirky as an IDE (probably due to its built-in Scala compiler which gives way too many faux compile errors. This is maddening in a statically checked language!), and Eclipse-based Scala IDE is only slightly better. They recommend entirely disabling incremental compilation in the IDE, and instead using SBT for this. Coincidentally, this is what someone here on HN told me is the &quot;unofficial recommendation&quot; from the Typesafe guys -- I wouldn&#x27;t know. As another example of broken tools, with Scala IDE refactoring is so fundamentally broken I cannot use it; it often results in wrong code (with Kepler-based Scala IDE, I&#x27;ve tried refactoring the name of a method and it resulted in <i>syntax errors</i> in other files!). Debugging is also hit-and-miss, at least with Scala IDE.<p>This is miles away from most Java IDEs, which are perfect in this regard. Not having compile errors correctly reported <i>as you type</i> is truly disappointing. Not being able to reliable refactor or debug code is very frustrating.<p>(I realize this is a tooling problem, and I love Scala. I&#x27;m just puzzled that almost nobody seems to consider these issues as disappointing as I do).",1419901208

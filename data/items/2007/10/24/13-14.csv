That at first he was pretty sure the Turing machine's behavior was simple enough that he could prove that it wasn't universal. But then, as he studied it, he realized that there were little bits of behavior that were more complicated. And it was with these that he managed to show universality.""</i><p>Just another data point in favor of tinkering, I guess.",1193234017

72049,comment,72011,72011,0,0,edw519,,,"Isn't it interesting how you can take the exact same technology product and take it to market 2 very different ways?  The is the opposite of the currently popular ""Get Eyeballs & Monetize Later"" approach.  If you can get people to pay for your web app, there's a lot to be said for bootstrapping.  You keep all your equity.  Hitting singles and doubles are probably more likely.  Homeruns, less likely.  Good tips for a viable approach.  (My default if funding never materializes)",1193233495
72048,comment,71952,71987,0,0,falsestprophet,,,"That does not make a great deal of sense from an evolutionary perspective. For bisexuality to be selected for in women, it would have to confer an evolutionary advantage. I would guess that it simply has not been selected against because it does not confer a great disadvantage. <p>However, tolerance for homosexual acts between men seems to be strongly selected against. Creating sperm is expensive and wasting them with a man is not to your advantage. It was also important for men to be highly focused on interfacing with females; females could be apathetic and reproduce, because they didn't really have a choice.",1193233151

You write very well: many great 'functional-style programmers' like you have nicely written blogs filled with sacks of good thoughts and ideas.<p>However, when I look around I rarely see any results of your work.""<p>\nIt seems his argument is that there is some evolution at work in the marketplace. Instead of arguing the ""bestness"" of language X or Y, simply look around and see what is thriving and what isn't. That would be a great discussion to have here. I'd add more, but I think I'd sound like a troll. Good article.",1193232795

141828,comment,141629,141629,0,0,jsdalton,,,"I've used CI on several projects. I've also used Rails. Here's my take on CI.<p>The good stuff:<p>* GREAT documentation\n* Code was designed around performance, and it is pretty darn quick.\n* PHP4 based. (This, btw, is only a plus for a tiny few people. There's no need to be on PHP4 any more.)<p>The bad:<p>* The ""model"" layer is not really an ORM at all. It's just a slightly fancy way of wrapping SQL statements. This is better than no separation of concerns, but it's not really an object oriented way of accessing the model layer.\n* It misses out on all the great things that are going on with PHP5.\n* It's open source but privately developed. The pace of evolution is glacially slow, and decisions about the direction of the framework are made closed doors.<p>To me, CI is a HUGE advance over throwing code together in php files, but it doesn't really have enough abstractions to qualify as a true MVC framework.<p>If you do decide you like CI, check out kohana php. This is an open source, community developed fork of CI -- that's built for PHP5.<p>For what it's worth, I'm far happier coding in Rails (and the little bit of django I've tried), and would probably recommend those if you're not afraid of abandoning php.",1206038674

It's not like there are tons of IPOs that can dry up.<p>The interesting part is the diff between now and then. The availability of easy money can change fast.

141813,comment,141629,141784,0,0,drm237,,,"Very true.  The problem I have with calling it a rails clone is that people expect things like scaffolding, ORM, and auto code creation.

IMO it works for strategy games, but not so much for RPGs.  Yes, the procedural world is larger and has more replayability, but once your brain becomes used to the algorithms used to generate it, it becomes as repetitive as anything else.<p>I'd be happy to find a game that proves me wrong (not that I can afford the time to let myself get sucked into an MMORPG anymore...)",1206037423

141805,comment,140602,140909,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"I don't think it is ""mostly"" true. This is a romanticized view of both startup failure and what your non-startup peers may or may not be doing by choosing the ""safe"" employee path.<p>- startup founders and employees are often complete freaks. they wouldn't get hired at Google in the first place, and are definitely not interested in pee-wee softball and 2.2 Volvos in the garage. Statistically, the type-A Ivy League wunderkinds are taking those stable jobs. The bulk of startup founders I meet dropped out of no-name schools or even high school.<p>- if you are an early employee at a VC funded startup you make close to market rate salary... that's the whole point of the VC funding... to hire key employees.<p>- the most successful startups I know of were founded by people who still had jobs, were in graduate school, or saved up a bunch of money at a previous job.<p>- Another unspoken story about startup founders is that a significant percentage of them come from wealthy families or  have parents with serious connections in the industry. It is easier to take ""risks"" when you have a trust fund.<p>- The valley is filled with MORE sad, ""failed"" people who toiled as an employee at Yahoo or Apple or Adobe for 7 years, then freaked out or got laid off.<p>I'm also not sure the novelist community is littered with sad failures, either. Most novelists have day jobs. It is unlikely many failed or successful novelists passed over a lucrative corporate marketing career to suffer for their craft.",1206037011

141801,comment,141591,141591,0,0,astine,,,"I disagree with this. The argument seems to be that the only valid reasons to discredit a language are extrinsic to the language itself. Granted, one should always take into account the language's problem domain and design principles before criticizing for lacking X or having X, but this doesn't mean that the language itself can be poorly designed or have issues.<p>Java really is verbose.\nPerl really does have an inconsistent syntax.\nC++ really does lend itself to memory errors.<p>Do each of these languages solve the problem that they were meant to solve? I think so. Do each of them still have issues that deserve criticism? Of course.<p>I think that there is nothing wrong with criticizing a language.

When you consider that there are so many variations on fairytales due to innovations in ora transmission, yet we are able to pretty much accurately piece together one editorially authoritative version of the Illiad, the ability for oral tradition to preserve stories doesn&#x27;t seem so impressive anymore.",1453791552

They are relatively distinct.  Add to those a handful of properly-black projects and there are perhaps a hundred types in service.  Compare that to the thousands of civilian models out there, many of them very odd looking.  Things like Rutan&#x27;s VariEze get rather close to the flying-triangles.  And some very unique objects, including random light patterns, also fly in the civilian world.

So here&#x27;s my best:<p>I expect that if a file uses CRLF everywhere, `git merge` will not leave it in a state with mixed line endings after inserting conflict resolution markers that end in LF instead of CRLF.<p>This shouldn&#x27;t require a configuration option, but if it does, fine.  However, Git doesn&#x27;t even seem to have this.<p>What it does have are &#x27;autocrlf&#x27; and &#x27;eol&#x27; and &#x27;text&#x27; options/attributes.  For anyone who mentions those, I&#x27;m going to ask that you be familiar with not just what those actually control, but also how they&#x27;re documented in the git man pages and in the book from git-scm.org—the entire premise was a discussion about Git&#x27;s user-facing parts.  By either source, those options control line normalization (i.e., implicit automatic conversion), which is not what I&#x27;m talking about.  And the documentation for those is sick enough that even if they <i>were</i> the things to look to in order to configure this, then the idea that Git&#x27;s UI is on par with Mercurial nowadays would still be wrong.<p>EDIT: To clarify, the desired approach for this is, &quot;Use whatever line endings the file is already using&quot;.  Git&#x27;s approach to this is, &quot;Standardize on either LF or CRLF, and at your discretion enable what amounts to some glorified git hooks to ensure that policy is followed, through the use of some obtusely documented configuration options.

1222979,comment,1222912,1222912,0,0,jerf,,,"Bear with me here, I have to lay down some foundation to get to my point.<p><i>Bias</i> has a specialized definition in machine learning; in a (really thin) nutshell, it represents the set of concepts a given technique can represent. If your banana vs. ball classifier can only represent ""roundness"" and ""yellowness"", the bias will prevent it from seeing a yellow cube as anything but a banana. (If you really dig in, I find this concept is really a superset of the traditional meaning of ""bias"" and find it a lot more edifying, but that's beyond this post.)<p>A learning agent, even a human, can only learn what their biases permit. Much of intellectually growing up is the process of learning better biases, for instance putting away ""magic"" and replacing it with ""chemistry"". If you've ever <i>felt</i> your brain stretching as you learn something (a foreign language, Haskell, etc), that's your biases growing. Characterizing growing biases mathematically has been a great challenge for machine learning, but it clearly happens to humans.<p>Alright, getting up to the payload here: I have actually had similar concerns about our educational patterns before because you can't effectively teach something until you have the necessary biases in place. Unfortunately, you can't stop learning, you are always learning. So what happens when you ""teach"" something to students that lack the ability to apply the correct biases? You get the square yellow cube effect above... one way or another it <i>will</i> fit the biases you have (give or take growth, which takes time). The result is semantic gibberish. Now, by itself it is inevitable that you will go thorough quite a lot of gibberish as you grow up (see also ""Kids Say the Darndest Things""), but why are we using precious school time to do that for math?<p>Furthermore, it is transparently obvious that things can be taught too soon. My 18-month-old is frolicking around my feet now, and he can't add. There's not much I can do to correct that right now. At some point he will, but this suffices to prove the point that there is a ""too soon"". So, when is it no longer ""too soon""? Are we really sure that our traditional answer is anything more than traditional, that it has any actual truth?<p>Teaching things early is not harmless, either. Think about it; how many adults have downright childish issues with math? Childish misunderstandings, childish opinions, childish beliefs? Coincidence? Bad motivation? Or a schooling system that jammed it into their brains before they were ready. And those that don't have childish problems... is it merely because we were ready soon enough, rather that necessarily any actual unique skill? Some people never recover.<p>It is at least a question worth research and thought before we knee-jerk an answer of ""if it was good enough for my grandpappy it's good enough for you"".<p>(Getting a little more controversial, this is why I don't support really early sex education (i.e., elementary school).

I still remember it vividly. Suddenly everything clicked, and I rocketed through all the material I was behind on.<p>I have six children, five of which are old enough to be in school. We have been home schooling them, I believe I have some creds on this.<p>Two of them (both girls) took right to math early on. No problem there. Two of them (both boys) couldn't be bothered, no matter what method we tried.<p>One of the girls was doing math before she could read, because she was a late reader. Couldn't read until she was 9. But suddenly she got it, and took off, and is reading voraciously today. Her younger sister was reading at 4.<p>Both boys are now doing pre-algebra. One is 13, the other 11.<p>We decided not to sweat it when thy were way behind. We just kept getting them to do what they could. If they weren't getting some concept, we went slower, or went to other topics they could understand. Eventually everything started clicking.<p>Cookie-cutter education could never do this. I agree that national education standards that fit all children into specific requirements by age, are foolish and harmful. As guidelines they are fine, but if the government is behind them they are never just guidelines. They won't fix the problem of bad and lazy teachers (in fact, they make that problem worse), and they don't help good teachers teach better.",1269698492

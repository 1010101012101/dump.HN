It should be Testimonials or something similar. Buzz is what others are saying about your site, like if TechCrunch wrote you up, etc.<p>5) The big customer support number discerns me.

Of course, you <i>can</i> put a hole in water, since that's what a boat is, but doing it incrementally (a piece here, a piece there, then bailing out the water, checking for leaks, etc) is going to be much more difficult than just building a boat out of the water and putting it in.

In my graduate entrepreneurial finance class, we studied a case where an entrepreneur had to choose between giving Rosati a non-trivial amount of equity in return for legal services or going to another law firm. Not knowing how important good lawyers are, when the professor suggested going with Rosati was the best course of action, I strongly argued against it. Since then, every time I have encountered a story about WSGR (often about Yokum and often on HN), I have been reminded of how wrong I was.",1240496635

  I think that I shall never see
  a graph more lovely than a tree.
  A tree whose crucial property
  is loop-free connectivity.
  A tree that must be sure to span
  so packet can reach every LAN.
  First, the root must be selected.
  By ID, it is elected.
  Least-cost paths from root are traced.
  In the tree, these paths are placed.
  A mesh is made by folks like me,
  then bridges find a spanning tree.

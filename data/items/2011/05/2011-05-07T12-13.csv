Some of the difficulty of parsing is because ""ease of human use"" has been a much higher priority than ""ease of parsing"" when discussing syntax, which leads to some constructs that aren't easy to parse with typical CFG-type parsing approaches. It's also designed to be very lenient to ordering and common errors, much like a modern non-strict HTML parser, which makes hand-writing the syntax more friendly and forgiving, but with a tradeoff that the parser has to be more complex, because it doesn't have the luxury of just returning a parse error.",1304770648

Any ""fixes"" to the wealth distribution are likely to sift down only to the nearest classes in the continuum: the acquisition of any wealth extracted from rich would be a task easiest for upper middle class.<p>Humans are likely to always form into a number of ""lower"" and ""upper"" groups: if we can't do it with money, we do it by some intangible property such as ancestry or nobility. Compared to those, I much prefer money.<p>Conversely, a person doesn't need much: we only need to guarantee some minimal standard of living, should a citizen wish to receive it, and we can afford that if we wanted. There's no reason to try and take on the impossible task of ""fixing"" inequality: unless we gave an equal salary to everyone we would still have some people who form the poormost group.<p>The only thing that does matter is how well the poormost are doing. We can fix that if we want. Compared to them everyone else is doing just fine, equality or inequality, more Porsches or less Porsches.",1304770215

Lacewing splits input lines on ""\r\n"" but browsers often happily accept ""\n"" as a line delimiter (see 19.3 of RFC 2616 for Postel-esque tolerance discussion). So the client can send a request header like:<p><pre><code>  Cookie: foo=bar\n<naughty stuff>\r\n

Also member states have already given up a <i>lot</i> of their sovereignty to the EU.<p>We are continually told that the US is a terribly unequal society - I'm just curious how things would work out if you took something like the EU (higher GDP, much higher population) and compared it to the US.<p>Note that I am a European, I'm generally pro-EU but I think Europeans generally unfairly criticize the US in this area when we actually live in an increasingly shared society that clearly has its own issues with inequality.",1304769716

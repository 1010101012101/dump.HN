I later found out (after copious reinstallations and attempts at finding an earlier version at oldversions.com) that there's a tiny icon, of which the chance to find is several orders of magnitude smaller than that of the Higgs boson - that restores the bloated piece of crap to a an actual IM-only client.<p>Of course, Microsoft also made the effort of cramming in more awful toolbars (that can't be removed) and replacing all the emoticons with a new suite of something even worse than what you would expect to find in a ten-year-old version of ICQ.<p>This may sound silly, but <i>all</i> chat clients on- and offline have <i>dreadful</i> emoticons; emoticons are meant to disambiguate and diffuse in favour of the sender and represent their mood and tone. <i>That is their purpose.</i> It really makes interaction with friends and acquaintances much easier and joyous. There's a limit to how you can stand out from other IM clients, and this is perhaps the biggest yard stick.<p>Live Messenger had the best (the only good) set of emoticons, and now Windows have thrown it all away while bloating the client even more.<p>I am fine with them throwing billions at something that may or may not work, but why the hell are they destroying their biggest brand products in this futile attempt to becoming relevant and cool?<p>I shudder at the thought at what Windows 8 will be like. Will they implement Clippy in the terminal to compete with Mac OS?",1288198768

It's not that you can't do a lot with self-serve media, or that there's not a huge business for such media. It's that ad agencies serve a different class of clientele, one that has bigger scope and bigger budgets. And, once the budget and scope grow beyond a certain point, it becomes worthwhile to have <i>actual humans</i> negotiate the deals. After all, negotiation is pretty difficult to automate, and most ads are not commodity products.",1288198738

All the tickets were sold for $50, no reselling occurs.  The difference between the highest price (presumably 50$) someone was willing to pay and the highest price of our rich patron is lost in utility.  A better scenario would be guy sells his $50 ticket for some price more than the value he would get from the ticket and capturing excess utility himself.

1839351,comment,1838091,1839085,0,0,WALoeIII,,,"50,000 ft overview:<p>Rspec: Behavior Driven Development Framework. It is essentially a different approach to testing than the test/unit (which Rails uses by default). In Rspec you are more interested in testing the side effects of your code, i.e. its behavior, you are less concerned with the internals. This doesn't mean you should write huge methods, and in the end your specs and tests will look pretty similar. My company uses Rspec on our main project.<p><a href=""http://gist.github.com/649417"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gist.github.com/649417</a><p>People will argue the value of the different styles until they're blue in the face. I liked Rspec's syntax more so thats where I started, but in the end I know both and think they each have their own merits and its probably a total wash. Recently with things like shoulda and other tools both approaches are rapidly converging on the same feature set.<p>Cucumber: Integration framework. This tests your whole stack end-to-end. Depending on what you are building this may be the only way to test it, and for a lot of people they are just doing Unit + Integration tests and not writing any controller tests. You write in Gherkin (<a href=""http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wiki/gherkin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wiki/gherkin</a>) which is a special subset of English. You can also use Steak (<a href=""http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/steak-because-cucumber-is-for-vegetarians/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/steak-because-cucumber-is-f...</a>) which lets you write your story in pure Ruby. Either way, this story is broken out in to steps and then some driver follows those steps, either driving or emulating a web browser. The original driver was Webrat, which you can think of as a web browser in Ruby. Webrat has been replaced by Capybara which is more complete and has pluggable backends, including Selenium. If you aren't using much JavaScript you can stay in pure Ruby and your tests will be parsing the HTML with something like Nokogiri, this is also pretty fast. If you have complex JS you can actually drive Selenium which in turn will drive a real browser (you can even drive flock of different browsers). Depending on how complex you get this can be a total PITA, so I would start simple with just getting it running in pure Ruby and maybe testing your sign-up form.<p>Story -> Cucumber -> Capybara -> Selenium -> Firefox... its a lot of layers and as a result can be suuuuuuper slow.<p>Factories: Instead of pre-loading a database with stuff (fixtures), factories let you write code that returns prepped objects for you. ActiveRecord takes a row from a table and converts it to an Object (Object Relational Mapper - ORM). Say a post from the posts table into a Post object. Factory Girl will just make you a Post object. I much prefer factories because you can actually get a stack trace to figure out where all the data came from instead of shifting between a SQL database, a YAML file, and a Ruby file to find your 'fixture fail'. There are some variations on preferred syntax and Factory Girl supports most of them.<p>Shoulda: Just some macros to save you typing. Most of them work in both Test/Unit and Rspec. Instead of writing a test like this to ensure there is a validation error if number in't a number:<p><a href=""http://gist.github.com/649419"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gist.github.com/649419</a><p>Just saves you time and typing, at the expense of learning the helpers.<p>A good test is something that breaks when the code breaks. Start small, test a few 3 line methods and then build up successively higher tests. Read the tests of some projects on github to get a feel for what they're looking to test, and how they approach it. Then just ask a lot of questions.",1288197651

1839320,comment,1839022,1839022,0,0,sp4rki,,,"A) At what point? From the beginning. You said it yourself, you go through notebook pages with UI before even writing code. You need to have a structure in place before you begin anything. Sure you can morph it as you go, but you need a direct connection to what you are trying to achieve. At the same time you're coding some functionality, you should be thinking about how this is going to be displayed. It's of course not necessary to do any of the graphics or styling at this point, but it works better if you give it some thought and try to form some type of layout and broad design ideas as you go. It's worth doing photoshop mockups when you reach a point where the application development can benefit from being graphically beautiful (which can vary immensely... every project is an island). You draw the line at the first moment you can. If and when you reach a minimum point where your application could be used by the masses, freaking ship it. You can fix and add features later, but the moment you have enough to ship that thing out the door - do it. Software is never ""finished"" anyways, so you'll need to keep going at it anyways.<p>B) Almost all the information regarding UI usability and user experience holds up regardless of age. The concepts are the same now and when it was written. There are also a LOT of resources written in the last few years, so I'd disagree that all the information is old. In any case, it really doesn't matter, you're still going to need to come up with your own conclusions for your specific case. No amount of UI/XI reading is going to allow you to skip having to do you're own testing and to draw your own conclusions on what works for you.<p>C) In the web industry the designer/artist is generally also the guy that codes your Html/Css/Jquery. A front end developer is generally the person that designs interaction and pretty screens. The back end guy is the one doing the algorithms, database work, etc. You can outsource everything, though the results are usually not even on the same league as the worst results you can get from a good team that clicks working together. You can always have a contractor come in and work with you or your team if needed, and that can sometimes be a better compromise than outsourcing per se.<p>D)I started as a programmer at an early age, but I was also an artist. What put me on that path is that I wanted to know how to do everything. From Photoshop to Rails to C to server security and deployment. I started learning by doing. Don't look for guidance man, just work on a project and when you need something you're not comfortable doing, freaking do it anyways. Need to do graphics, test layouts, a/b testing? Read on it and start doing it asap. At some point you'll become decent at it, and then one day you're actually good at doing it too! Obstacles? There are no obstacles, only challenges. Challenge yourself and you'll come out a winner.",1288197304

Pure programmers (writing algorithms, optimizing, scaling, etc.) don't really need design skills.<p>You definitely need product developer(s) on your team if your startup is consumer facing at all.  In such a small (2-3 person) team, everyone needs to do multiple jobs, so if none of you have decent design skills, then start practicing now.<p>Part A - Usually a proof-of-concept happens first either in basic wireframe mockups or basic/ugly code.  Once you'er clear on the product you want to build, then full designs are done in Photoshop or, once in a while, direct HTML.<p>Part B - I would mostly ignore that stuff.  Simply look at great/big sites and see what the do right, but <i>more importantly</i> look at what they could improve and do that yourself.  Basically, make your interface design as simple as possible while having the minimum feature set to make your product useful - finding that balance is where you become a great product developer.<p>Part C - Don't outsource your design.  If you commit to design as a core competency in your development team, then you understand that design is not just visual - design encapsulates everything that the user experiences with your product.<p>Part D - I started off as a cartoon animator in college, but found I was better at coding, then I realized that to make great products, I need to have great design.  I didn't have a design monkey, so I started creating my own designs (poorly at first) taking inspiration from products I enjoyed.  To overcome obstacles in design, I simply take the worst part of a page/workflow and fix that first... repeat until the product is due or there aren't any cringe-worthy features.",1288197209

Palo Alto is cool, those stanford women are something else... but tommy had none of it. His room in a house was all coke cans and monitors.

If you have already coded all your backend, you might feel constrained when designing the UI or might realize too late that you oversaw some critical parts of your system. Let me illustrate:<p>Let's say you are building a ""C.V. builder app"". You might start coding with the assumption that the user has to be login to start building his C.V. However, if you imagine the UX first, you might realize that it would be nice to ask the user to register only once he wants to save his newly created C.V. That simple detail might have a huge impact on your code base.<p>B - Some resources & inspiration: <a href=""http://uxmovement.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uxmovement.com/</a>, <a href=""http://ui-patterns.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ui-patterns.com/</a>, <a href=""http://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/inspiration/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/inspiration/</a>, <a href=""http://www.dribbble.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dribbble.com</a>.<p>C - If you're good at UX/UI design but lack the Photoshop skills to bring your vision to life, it should be safe to outsource. In any case, make sure your designer really ""gets"" your vision.<p>D - I started learning to design and program at about the same time. Since then, I've put most my time into programming and although I consider myself pretty good at designing user interfaces, I lack the technical skill and experience to make them look beautiful. If you're the same as me, I would suggest spending some time trying to really master Photoshop or such tool. Also, some color/typography theory can't hurt.",1288195457

There was a time where PC's used to be called 'Wintel' (Windows/Intel) machines because pretty much every PC made had Windows on it.<p>> I think the main things that people immediately associate with the actual word ""Microsoft"" might be mice and keyboards.<p>Wishful thinking ... although I think eventually this will happen.

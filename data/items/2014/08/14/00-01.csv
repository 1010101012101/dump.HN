8175629,comment,8172365,8172365,3,0,csandreasen,,,"If the last straw to leak this information was when Snowden learned about this MonsterMind program, why are we learning about it more than a year later without any prior mention whatsoever? (and without documents to back up the claims) Also, if he learned about it after taking up his job with Booz Allen Hamilton in 2013, why was he contacting Glenn Greenwald in December of 2012?[1]  Ditto with the excuse that Clapper&#x27;s testimony in March 2013 factored into his decision to leak...<p>I&#x27;m honestly curious why so many people are willing to take Snowden&#x27;s claims at face value.  The NSA rightly got a lot of flack for the softball interviews on Dateline a few months back, but it feels like the general consensus is that the softball interviews with Snowden are beyond questioning.<p>[1] <a href=""http://us.macmillan.com/excerpt?isbn=9781627790734"" rel=""nofollow"">http://us.macmillan.com/excerpt?isbn=9781627790734</a>",1407977986

What is correct behavior for higher-order functions which accept function arguments that may time out?<p>The official answer is probably that you&#x27;d use some sort of monad to sweep that mess under the carpet.  At which point you&#x27;ve just proposed a very close functional analogue to some of the worst shenanigans that used to happen with distributed objects back in the &#x27;90s.<p>A better answer would be to say that you use something like Erlang&#x27;s actor model.

8175625,comment,8175453,8175453,6,0,mikeash,,,"Developer time is one of the most important things to optimize. Bandwidth is really cheap by comparison.<p>P2P isn&#x27;t completely reliable. There are many cases where you can talk to a server but you can&#x27;t talk to a peer, ranging from evil firewalls to excessive layers of NAT to simple things like the target device being offline. Thus, you must code a fallback that talks to a server if you want reliability. This server fallback will work for <i>all</i> situations, so it&#x27;s necessarily easier to just use it for everything and not bother to code the P2P bit at all.<p>P2P is also really hard to do well. It&#x27;s pretty easy to do poorly: have one device tell the other device what its IP address is and a port to connect to, then connect to it. In practice, this fails about 99% of the time because approximately all consumer internet users are behind NAT these days. So then you enter the wonderful world of NAT traversal meaning you have to deal with horrifying things like UPNP, NAT-PMP, and STUN. And this is when both sides keep the same IP address throughout the connection! Now consider when your smartphone user goes from Starbucks, where he has WiFi, to the bus, where he only has LTE, to home, where he has WiFi again.<p>Bandwidth is cheap. Let&#x27;s say it would take Snapchat one developer-month to implement this, or about $10,000. (I&#x27;d wager this would be a strong underestimate, both in terms of time required and the cost of that time.) Amazon S3, to take a random example, charges 12 cents per GB of outgoing transfer to the internet at lower use levels. You can buy 83TB with that $10,000. If your typical Snapchat image is 1MB (they&#x27;re low resolution, right?) then you&#x27;d have to P2P 83 million images before you broke even on the investment. Factor in a more realistic timeframe, a more realistic cost, and the opportunity costs of not having that developer work on something more useful, and the payoff goes up by an order of magnitude or more.<p>P2P does get used where it pays off well. That&#x27;s either high-bandwidth stuff or low-latency stuff. WebRTC does P2P whenever it can. Apple&#x27;s FaceTime does P2P when they&#x27;re not disabling that functionality to placate patent trolls. Skype does (or at least did, I seem to recall some changes) P2P for audio and video. And of course nothing beats BitTorrent for sending massive amounts of data to large numbers of people. But it just doesn&#x27;t pay off unless you&#x27;re really sending a lot of stuff.",1407977929

There was an ever increasing spot of vision missing, which came to engulf half my vision, but of course I&#x27;m aware that the missing part is cutting into my field of vision; I could still map the places in the field of vision where I should see external objects, and imagine something superimposed there. I would say that it was similar to (but eventually larger than) the natural blind spot that occurs where the optic nerve meets the retina. There is no specific color there (it is not black), but we know that an object which should be seen has disappeared because of that spot, and we can imagine that it ought to be there.<p>I&#x27;d like to add that I had a recent recurrence of an aura, after some twenty years!

Last I heard, breaking PGP was equivalent to being able to factor large integers into a product of prime numbers.  So, NSA is able to do that, and no one else can, no one in the public heard about it, no university research mathematician published about it, NSA has mathematicians who figured out how to do that but their major profs back in grad school don&#x27;t know how, no one got a Fields Medal for it, etc.?  I don&#x27;t believe that.<p>What&#x27;s going on here?<p>He means I need a Faraday cage?  Okay, tell the NSA I have one; put it in place this afternoon.<p>He means the NSA has trained cockroaches that can wiggle into my hard drives while I sleep and steal all my data?  If so, then fine.  I&#x27;ll spray bug killer.<p>Otherwise, why should I believe that the NSA could crack my PGP encrypted e-mail?",1407976590

You&#x27;re right in pointing out that opportunity cost is the real cost.<p>If this was the only game I was ever going to make, I probably would have spent my time better on things other than localizing it nearly a year into its lifespan.<p>I think the most important point is that we left plenty of money on the table by not having the localization available on day one. The localization was launched very late into the game, and almost all revenue comes from the major promotional periods.<p>It will be interesting to compare results with the sequel to see if we have notably larger market share right from the start in the languages we choose to localize in, I think that will provide a little more conclusive data than this admittedly murky analysis.",1407976400

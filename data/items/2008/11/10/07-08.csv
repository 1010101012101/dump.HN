I think it's possible for a society to legitimately find good places for everybody to work without it being haberdashery. Just automate all of the pointless, frivolous tasks, and find more meaningful jobs for everybody.",1226303830

359004,comment,358677,358935,0,0,unalone,,,"Hulu made registration incredibly easy (no leaving the page) so I can forgive it for that. And I'd agree with you for the other things, but! Hulu is designed specifically for viewing ""professional"" content. That means that the focus of the site's layout becomes geared not towards usability, but towards aesthetic. And in that regard, its various florishes - having the smaller screen appear like it's in a grayed-out ""TV frame"" - are extremely good-looking.<p>The ""popular items"" makes perfect sense to me, for the following reason: they maintain consistency as you go between links. If I watch Arrested Development and navigate to a certain page, that page remains as I go to the next video. And Hulu doesn't care about perpetuance: they aren't trying to show fair views. They're here to show content. Because of that, showing the most popular content for an item makes sense: if you assume that people either watch in a linear fashion or they come to the site for one particular thing, then you want to offer a linear view and a ""most popular"" view, to satisfy both groups.<p>See, I mentioned Hulu specifically because it's designed for more hardcore watching than Youtube. If I go to Hulu, I'm either looking for something specific, or I'm browsing. On YouTube, browsing means looking through recommended content for other interesting videos. Hulu doesn't need to, though: they specialize in lengthy clips, and because of that fewer people will be randomly browsing. They would be worse off with the more ""capable"" interface from YouTube.<p>Futura is rendered in Flash when it's dynamic, as an image when it's not. I think that makes sense. Making the image means no need for Flash workaround. However, when you're adding dynamic content, it's too much of a bother to generate an image for each new item.<p>Besides: all of this is moot, because in the end what matters is the video-watching experience. Hulu offers two resolutions both above YouTube standards; they hide the menu bar when you watch; their display is less visually jarring. And if your business is distributing professional video content, the display is all that matters. (If you're dealing with amateur work, YouTube is still worse than Vimeo. But then again, Vimeo tries to cater to a slightly more professional audience, I suppose.)",1226303150

358992,comment,358580,358921,0,0,netcan,,,"Of all the arguments Richard Dawkins tends to make, this is one of one of the most important. It isn't new or particularly profound.<p>You needs to take this down a notch from the pure philosophical theory. As an atheist, saying you don't believe in god or that you are sure the He doesn't exist is OK. Even if you couldn't convince Des Carte (he went the other way).<p>You are sure as you are that celestial teapots or fairies do not exist. Or more to the point, as sure as a Muslim is that Apollo does not drive his chariot across the sky or a Christian is that there are not multiple gods. That is the level where the discussion needs to be conducted.<p>Not fair to make atheists conduct their analysis at the level where you might be a brain in a vat while eveyone else gets to live in the world where the floor is solid, gravity pulls down & today is followed by tomorrow. The point is to treat the debate just like any other. The existence of god & fertilisation methods for turnips. Use the normal set of tools we use to evaluate everything else.<p>At the level that you are (rudely) probing atheists, the atheist is agnostic not just about the existence of god, but the existence of dogs, aliens, angels, pyramids & burglars. Certainly agnostic about any of the unseeable uknowable objects of the world. On any level that is meaningful, many skeptical agnostics (after some gentle probing) are atheist.",1226302335

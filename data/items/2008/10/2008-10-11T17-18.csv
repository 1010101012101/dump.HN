I'm not sure if the EU-wide tuition equality is already in place for Bulgarian and Romanian nationals, but if it is, that will make Sweden <i>substantially</i> cheaper than the US, unless you can get some kind of grant or scholarship.<p>EDIT: If you're planning to go to a top university, the US or the UK are probably good places to go.

To properly discuss the candidates, parties, and whatnot, you can't stop at their economic policies that <i>might</i> affect people here, but have to consider foreign relations, civil liberties, and a slew of other things that would just bog this site down.

329813,comment,329448,329803,0,0,maxklein,,,"If I were to have an accident or to fall sick right now, I'd worry about my health, and nothing more, because I live in a country with socialized healthcare. If this were to happen in the U.S, I'd have tens of thousands of dollars of debt. To work my way out of this debt would make me a slave for years.<p>Support for social heathcare is to recongize that one day you may be in the same position. In fact, when you are a really old man, you WILL be in that position. You'll be on a pension and you'll have lots of illnesses. I pay 8% of my income so that this never has to be a worry.<p>Social healthcare may not be a fundamental human right, but it's a hell of a convenient thing!",1223747170

Mapping caps to ctrl means you're going to be using your pinky a lot.

""Competition will cause insurance companies to drop price and increase service.  Innovation will come to insurance and new and different types of policies will enter the market, making it even more competitive.  Consumer behavior will cause people to shop for insurance and minimize costs while trying to increase coverage.""",1223746304

329803,comment,329448,329758,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Rights are those things that are inherent parts of being a human. When something infringes on my rights, the power of the state is used to maintain them. We have rights to represent the minimal amount of state-sanctioned force that is required to keep us all civil.<p>You cannot have a right to goods and services that somebody else currently owns. Using the power of the state to acquire medical goods and services is not a basic necessity of being a human.<p>We've lived millions of years without the state caring for our daily health. We can live millions more without the state and we'll be just be fine.<p>For a constitutionally-trained lawyer to say that is to engage in demagoguery over substance. We have a problem with health care -- some free market principles do not work when you are dying. But cartoon solutions and slogans are not going to fix complex problems. Mark my words: we'll just end up more in debt, more frustrated, and more vulnerable to even more bullshit promises.",1223745836

329799,comment,328841,329705,0,0,anamax,,,"I don't know how much tax planning Gates does.  He may think that avoiding cap gains on $40M (which is what I heard that his house cost) isn't worth the trouble.<p>I previously mentioned using donations to shelter income.  His house offers some additional opportunities.<p>I think that a huge fraction of the cost went to cool custom gadgets.  If Gates set up a company to research/develop those gadgets, he can deduct the ""losses"" when said company doesn't manage to sell them.  Yes, he should pay for the gadgets themselves, but they're cheap compared to the NRE.<p>There are some ways to do tax-free roll-over to fund companies, so the deductions would shelter other income.<p>Even if Gates had to pay cap gains to fund the company that developed the gadgets, he's way ahead if the deductions are at ordinary income rates.  If he both pays and deducts at cap gains rates, he's just out cap gains on the gadgets themselves.<p>However, like I said, I don't know how much tax planning Gates does.  He has over $60B, so avoiding cap gains on $40M is like someone with $2M avoiding cap gains on a cheap used car.  Then again, he may have set up a system 20 years ago to pull out money tax-free every year.  Putting $40M through it may be just SOP.",1223745526

b) No easy VC = you won't be able to get 20 million dollars to build yourself a widget.<p>It'll also be much more invovled, you'll need to come up with a business model that starts turning a profit from day 1. And you will probably need to start thinking in 10 years, instead of the typical 5.<p>But if you started your startup w/o planning to go for VC or a short-term acquisition, then the market really didn't change that much.",1223744460

This happens in patients with psychogenic polydipsia.<p>Of course, drinking anywhere near 25L is not &#x27;safe&#x27; either, and can still cause electrolyte abnormalities, neurocognitive dysfunction, seizures...

Information overload problem - love the content and esp. reading the comments section but I couldn&#x27;t find that many extra hours a day! 2. Having to read the same topics day in day out - it annoys me that I&#x27;ve to scroll through and read the same topics again and deciding whether I&#x27;ve read it or not before scrolling on.<p>So I propose a solution as to how I would like to use it if I were to code the app myself. I love reading highly upvoted topics with plenty of comments and I fear that I will miss out on future comments which may be insightful in a life-changing kind of way. So in Version 1, the Hacker News app would: 1. Be able to highlight &quot;peaked&quot; topics by level. Just imagine the WiFi signal strength bar but for how peaked a topic has reached. To measure how peaked it is, there is a calculation for each topic whereby the comments posted per day is measured relative to the previous day. Sort of like measuring the deceleration of comments. 2. Grey out topics that I&#x27;ve read 3. Ability to Upvote and in my case also send the topic URL or the comments URL to Pocket<p>More features to come but that is what I would build first to save myself (and hopefully other passive consumers of information like me) tonnes of time. I hope Paul Graham and team is OK with it, since you could tell there is a small group of users who rarely posts comments unless we have a great gem to share.<p>Since I plan to learn RubyMotion, I was wondering if anyone is interested to join me in building this open source app?

I don&#x27;t know if you ever checked but people aren&#x27;t kidding when they say non-christians, non-whites, ... are more criminal and less smart and ... with the exception of one or two asian ethnicities. In theory saying this by itself is not discriminatory, only acting upon it is, but I doubt most people will agree. But you&#x27;re going to find actual statistics supporting that. Yet any conclusions obviously are discriminatory.<p>What&#x27;s worse is this. Suppose you have 2 groups with each a normal distributed variable (like weight, height, money, likelihood of criminal intent, ...) and let&#x27;s say a 1% difference in the peak (which is what everyone will always report, standard deviations are also always different, but nobody ever reports them, but when people say Asians are less tall than Caucasians in 1% of cases (real figure is about 6%), this is what they mean). To make things simple, lets say<p>group A ~ N(100, 10)<p>group B ~ N(101, 10)<p>(N(100, 10) is like the &quot;standard&quot; normal distribution for things without reasonable units)<p>What do you see in practice ? Suppose you meet someone (randomly) from group A and someone (again, uniform random) from group B. What are the chances the member from group A is heavier/taller/richer/more criminal/... than the member of group B ?<p>E(X > Y, X ~= N(101, 10), Y ~= N(100, 10)) ~ 59%<p>So in our example, if you meet an Caucasian and an Asian, and there&#x27;s 1% height difference between the groups, the chance is about 60% that the Caucasian is taller than the Asian. If taken the real figure, 6% difference, then the chance becomes 91%.<p>This is the problem that causes racism.

Really? I thought that term was retired long ago; maybe I should have said &quot;so-called feature&quot;. But no, I don&#x27;t consider it a feature, rather an annoyance that again, I never asked for or approved. I don&#x27;t like to use car analogies, but one easily springs to mind: Imagine buying a new car, and right before you settle into the driver&#x27;s seat to pull off the lot, the dealer stops you, readjusts your mirrors to point to the sky, changes the radio presets to stations you&#x27;ve never heard of, sets the transmission on sporty mode, and adjusts the seat to a severe angle. When you ask him what the hell he&#x27;s doing, he tells you that in your contract you opted in to dealer presets, and you&#x27;ll have to manually change all of them back yourself. Annoying, huh?<p>>  And note that the backup is private, they aren&#x27;t publishing these for the world to see or anything.<p>Correct, but I never gave them permission to use my metered data, nor my limited cloud storage space. What if I don&#x27;t want those 200 or so 3MB pictures I took to eat up my entire monthly data allotment? If the setting is opt-out, and I didn&#x27;t know it was doing it, it can be an expensive &quot;feature&quot;. Something like that should definitely be opt-in.<p>> Do you want all new features to be opt-in?<p>Of course not; I never said that. But most should be, especially those relating to high data use.<p>> The toast pop-up alerting you to the new feature, with an option to disable it, the first time it&#x27;s used is the best way to do this.<p>Except when that popup never shows up again, and you find out days or weeks later that the device has been doing things you didn&#x27;t expect it to in the background.<p>And beyond all of this, there&#x27;s the issue the OP raised, which is where Google decides to use one of your pictures as your profile photo, without any user intervention. If they will do that, who knows what else they will do with the rest of your photos? I found that some pictures I had taken while on vacation were somehow mixed into a &quot;story&quot; with other, unrelated pictures. Some pictures that I took in succession in the same location were put into an animated GIF without my knowledge or permission.

Not because of a higher rate of people committing actual crimes but simply because of the increased police presence.<p>All it takes is an ambitious cop who doesn&#x27;t want to leave his advancement to chance. Once you&#x27;re in the system it&#x27;s difficult/impossible to get out.<p>I grew up in a pretty nice area and rarely had encounters with the police unless I was doing something stupid and deserving of their attention. Even then, I was treated with decency and respect.<p>I didn&#x27;t understand the difference until I moved to an area that was close to a large police station and courthouse. There was no doubt about the increased police presence.<p>One day on my way to work on my motorcycle I got pulled over by the CHP (California Highway Patrol). When I went to hand over my license/registration/insurance the officer reached over and snatched the keys out of my ignition. Instead of telling me what I was being charged he started with a threat, &quot;you will cooperate or I&#x27;m going to tow your bike and haul you off to jail.&quot; I was completely shocked by his escalation of force because leading up to this I had no clue why I was being pulled over. I wasn&#x27;t driving fast, aggressive, or recklessly.<p>It turns out that California passed some wonky law a month prior that any muffler louder than stock (guess that gives Harleys a free pass) is illegal. I don&#x27;t run an aftermarket muffler so he couldn&#x27;t charge me. He tried his best to convince me that I was in the wrong but by then I had shrugged off the initial shock and wasn&#x27;t going to admit to an offense I didn&#x27;t commit.<p>He couldn&#x27;t pin me with the charge he pulled me over for. So, he held me there on the side of the road for 20 minutes antagonizing me and asking personal questions that had nothing to do with being pulled over. It was clear as day that I wasn&#x27;t going to be let go until either he could find another reason to charge me or he I&#x27;d snap and give him one.<p>Meanwhile, I did nothing out of the ordinary beside driving past a corrupt cop who was looking to bump the statistics on a new law and probably earn some brownie points with his boss.<p>As soon as my lease was up I moved the hell away from that area and try my best to avoid/evade the CHP when I see them.<p>I&#x27;m not saying all cops are bad. Escalation of force and violence are tools of their trade because violent criminals often don&#x27;t respond to anything else. The problem is, there is no incentive for them to hold back. Performance is measured by arrests and charges regardless of &#x27;actual&#x27; crime. Anybody who has worked for the US Govt knows that the survival of any government organization is based on perceived performance measurements, whether or not they serve the greater good.<p>It&#x27;s not much of a mystery why kids who grow up and get out of bad neighborhoods are usually the type who spend most of their childhood indoors reading, studying, or playing with a computer. The concept of &#x27;guilty by association&#x27; is common knowledge but the less understood one should be &#x27;guilty by proximity&#x27;.",1404180117

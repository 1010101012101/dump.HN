5950496,comment,5950436,5950436,6,0,patio11,,,"YMMV, but the best solution I&#x27;ve found for this is either:<p>1)  If your CMS just needs to be used in-house, then roll your own.  It takes a week or less, you can deep-integrate it into your applications, and you&#x27;ll be guaranteed to get more or less exactly what you want.<p>2)  If you either need it to be exposed to external/non-technical people or you absolutely do not want to spend time developing CMS features, use WordPress for content pages and your app stack of choice for app pages.  You can have them share the same domain if a requirement for e.g. SEO by using reverse proxy tricks -- trivial to Google if you know the words &quot;reverse proxy.&quot;  If not a requirement, don&#x27;t do it that way.<p>One of the nice parts about using WordPress is if you have a high-generalizability problem like &quot;It needs to work on an iPhone&quot; then you are basically guaranteed that some 17 year old designer has hacked together a plugin which makes it mostly work on your iPhone.  The downside of using WordPress is that... feel free to rephrase the last sentence.",1372301846

5950474,comment,5947584,5950105,3,0,tunesmith,,,"As a performer/songwriter, I don&#x27;t have a problem with that used cd bit conceptually.  All those cds were originally sold full price, generating full revenue.<p>The original purchaser bought it for full price, and assuming I&#x27;m a major artist like Aerosmith, that&#x27;s big money in the aggregate.  A cd isn&#x27;t rent, it means you get to enjoy that stuff for as long as you own it.  If the original purchaser wanted to transfer that ability to someone else even for <i>free</i>, I don&#x27;t have a problem with it.  I don&#x27;t see cds as somehow being linked to the original person&#x27;s lifespan, or a time-value of how long he&#x27;s likely to listen to it.  It&#x27;s the existence of the cd, period.  The fact that he got three bucks for it, more power to him.<p>Now, if he instead ripped the cd to continue his enjoyment and then sold or gave it away, to me that&#x27;s the same as keeping the cd and letting you rip it (either for free, or for three bucks).  That&#x27;s not okay.  He clearly liked it enough to &quot;keep&quot; it, so he should have kept it.  In which case (if everyone else acted the same way), you would have bought a new copy, which means more money for the artist.<p>At any rate, you, by purchasing a used cd, did nothing &quot;wrong&quot; from any perspective in my book, because it can&#x27;t be on you to ensure that the seller will no longer listen to or enjoy the music.  But people that sell their used cds, technically they&#x27;re stealing if they keep their rips after they sell it.  Or at least &quot;stealing&quot;, in the sense that it&#x27;s the same as letting someone else rip/burn their copy.",1372301491

Responding with &quot;you are forgetting about the performance royalties!&quot; is completely irrelevant.  The law is that digital radio pays performance royalties (through soundscan) in addition to songwriter royalties, and (US) radio only pays songwriter royalties.

Without a doubt, the per-stream value created by the ad supported model is a relative joke, but despite my desire for artists to get more value out of streaming and the fact that Pandora is my competitor for listener usage, I continue to side with Pandora on most of these issues.<p>There is no reason why iHeartRadio should pay less than them because it&#x27;s owned by Clear Channel. There is no reason they should keep paying ASCAP the same percentage of their revenue for royalties after someone as big as Sony ATV pulls their catalog from ASCAP representation.  The Internet Radio Fairness Act was not about necessarily reducing royalties, but ensuring that all companies streaming digitally pay the same percentage of revenue.  It makes absolutely no sense to me that everyone is focused on Pandora trying to reduce their rates to the same level as their competitors, instead of focusing on the fact that those competitors already pay less.<p>Compulsory rates that work for these companies are the best opportunity for independent artists to participate in this market.  If you force these companies to secure direct deals with labels because the compulsory rates are not equitable, you will get what just happened with iTunes Radio.  They will forge sweetheart deals with the major labels and treat indies like a nice-to-have group of second class citizens.<p>The artist community should be working harder to increase royalties paid by the companies already enjoying massive discounts.  The artist community should be interested in making their music as easy to license as possible, a la compulsory licenses.  If you make the rates unsustainable, and even worse, push the revenues through label accounting departments, artists will be left in the cold and have most of their share kept by labels.<p>Pandora has definitely gone about this in a way that hasn&#x27;t worked in terms of PR, but it is unfathomable to me that all of a sudden everybody on earth forgets that the person on the other side of this issue is the RIAA.  Nothing the RIAA has ever done was good for consumers or artists.  Why on earth would it be now?<p>Pandora pays more royalties than any other type of radio broadcaster.  It&#x27;s time to make other companies pay more, while finding a rate and system that works for everybody and doesn&#x27;t require direct licensing.  Any other situation does not bode well for artists.",1372300587

5950380,comment,5949072,5950272,7,0,mikeash,,,"That&#x27;s a good question. I&#x27;m not really sure, but I&#x27;m almost positive it&#x27;s related to Ruby or RubyMotion internals, not ARC in general.<p>As best I can tell from the article and the filed bug, it comes down to not retaining captured variables in blocks. In Objective-C, there&#x27;s some automatic memory management that happens for you when you capture a variable in a block:<p><pre><code>    id x = ...;\n    ^{ NSLog(@&quot;%@&quot;, x); };\n</code></pre>\nBecause the block depends on x, the lifetime of that object needs to be tied to the lifetime of the block. As such, the compiler emits code so that if and when you copy the block onto the heap, it automatically retains x. When the block object is destroyed, it automatically releases x.<p>Note that, while definitely &quot;automatic reference counting&quot;, this isn&#x27;t, strictly speaking, ARC. Because this is <i>so</i> critical to being able to use blocks without going completely insane, this bit of cleverness was introduced with blocks on 10.6, even though ARC didn&#x27;t exist yet.<p>The note in the bug says that it&#x27;s complicated because they don&#x27;t want to introduce a performance regression. This suggests that they&#x27;re not having trouble with retaining objects referenced by the block per se, but rather with being smart about it, so that it&#x27;s only retained when necessary. The Objective-C compiler does this by constructing blocks on the stack, and requiring an explicit copy to move them to the heap. Only when explicitly copied do they retain the variables they capture, so simple inline cases remain fast. Perhaps Ruby or RubyMotion have something that makes this harder to do.<p>If that&#x27;s correct, then I can&#x27;t say I find the excuse a very good one. Performance regressions are bad, but generating incorrect code is much worse. They need to fix it immediately, take the speed hit, then see about ways to improve performance while maintaining correctness. However, I certainly could be wrong.",1372299601

Buying a CD (which is a dying industry, which can be seen by the number of CD selling companies going out of business) has nothing to do with pandora. Pandora is an internet radio, end of story. It streams music over the internet, your radio streams music over the fm/am waves. Buying a CD is more expensive, because it&#x27;s suppose to become yours, while you may personally listen to it 10 times, that is not a problem for the CD seller. You paid $20 to buy their songs, you can listen to those songs millions of times over 15 years and play them in front of your friends, or at a house party. Or you can listen to it 1 time. But you don&#x27;t pay for the number of plays, because it could and can be unlimited. You could play that CD 24/7 for 10 years if you want.<p>That is what you are paying for.<p>Oh and if you think artists get 60% you should go talk to one. While some indie artists may get that.

This allows them to be both enabled/disabled while firefox is running, and not need to be rewritten every version. Look for the &quot;restartless&quot; tag on the addon website.<p>The six-week cycle probably helped as well, since there is less changes between versions; not to mention improved auto-updating.",1372298802

Short command names (like ls and rm) were used to save memory and paper (teletypes were used in the days before video terminals).  Each byte mattered back then.

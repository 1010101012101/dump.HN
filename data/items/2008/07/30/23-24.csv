If we're using 5kw and we want 100kw, saving that 5 is nice but only 5% of the goal.""<p>Your argument is flawed because you are assuming that you either have to create new electricity or conserve electricity and you can't do both. The least expensive way to get X units of new energy is always going to be some mix of conservation and creation, and the free market lets us find the most efficient point along the spectrum.<p>""People don't spend more money than they have to.

Sticking to the Intel chipsets (as I believe Linus himself recommended) will go a long way toward a smooth experience. And that's coming from a noob. I am on my first Ubuntu install on my soon to be old machine. I just built a new machine, and Hardy installed without a problem. Ran my 24 hour burn in test, no problems.

262446,comment,261839,262242,0,0,mdemare,,,"I agree that economic growth outweighs anything else.<p>But why would funding companies be the best way to generate the highest economic growth? There are many obstacles that prevent economic growth, especially in poor countries. Examples are high child mortality, malnourishment, corruption, lack of any kind of (micro-)credit, lack of education, tariffs, red tape, etc.<p>Taking away such obstacles can do very much for economic growth. The main advantage of funding companies is that their profits are returned to the investors.<p>E.g. the 1846 repeal of the Corn Laws had a much greater positive effect on economic growth in Britain than any investment in specific companies.",1217460050

Though I find the mouse following a little irritating, so the last one is a wee bit better.<p>But, the things I think are wrong:<p>Too much.  Over overwhelmed.<p>The Filters interface is horrible.  I couldn't find what I was looking for at all.  Sliding through the list looks awesome...but it's really time-consuming to use.  A dropdown would have been faster, and would be what users expect.  A simple textbox with auto-complete might also be a way to go about it.<p>There are too many types of filters for a front page.  Make it keywords by default, and hide the rest on an advanced search page.<p>Or, simply get rid of ""filters"" and make search work really nicely.  That'd remove a huge amount of the confusing stuff on your page...but maybe filters are worth having, regardless of clutter...you can decide that.  But you definitely need to do something about those filters.<p>The rest of the page might be a bit busy...but it looks pretty nice.<p>One thing you might consider is making a bunch of language specific versions, e.g.:<p>perl.siafoo.net\npython.siafoo.net\njava.siafoo.net<p>Or siafoo.net/perl, /python, etc.<p>Most people looking for a snippet of code will need it in their own language.  Sure, a lot of developers are happy to learn new techniques in many languages, but if it's a ""here's where you go to find the bit of code to do this tiny thing"" kind of site, then you probably want it to be obvious how to find the right language.  The ""Languages"" filter obviously already provides the functionality...so maybe a direct link is trivial to add.",1217459866

262443,comment,261598,262084,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"I suppose the website you link to isn't entirely useless. If I were contemplating buying a new computer (and I am), I could check every component of a potential computer against the list. If one component were red-listed, then I would know that Linux would not run on that computer. I could then go to my next choice and check every component again.<p>However, while lists such as these might help me weed out potential computers that won't work, it cannot help me find one that will work. I cannot avoid the compatibility lottery for two reasons: 1) the list is incomplete and 2) hardware compatibility varies from distro to distro and release to release.<p>I suppose you could make a similar website for the last two versions of every popular distro. Then, I could take each potential computer I was considering purchasing and check each component's compatibility in each distro I want to use (if one system won't work in Ubuntu 8.04, then maybe it will work in 7.10). Please note that this consumer nirvana would only work if the lists were reasonably complete.<p>What I would love is a website that links to computers from major manufacturers where the current version of a given distro works 100% after install. Perhaps Ubuntu could link to a set of major brand desktops and laptops that work with 7.10 and 8.04. That would be much more useful than a list such as this: <a href=""http://tuxmobil.org/ibm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tuxmobil.org/ibm.html</a>  which isn't exactly an easy-to-use Linux shopping guide.",1217459353

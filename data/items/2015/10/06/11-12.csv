The tests for the backend code take quite long to run as well compared to the frontend tests, so having this separation is nice for the frontend devs that way too.<p>What I some times would like to have better infrastructure support for though is throwaway prototypes/projects that can live in their own codebases and have access to all the regular databases, blob storage and so on, as well as databases that are private to the prototype that I can do whatever with with no risk of doing something bad to the important databases/storage.<p>I would also like these prototypes to be able to register themselves with the load balancer to take care of everything under `/halloween-experiment/` for example and have the load balancer add headers like `X-UserEmail`, `X-UserID`, `X-IsEmployee`, and so on so that I don&#x27;t have to implement authentication/authorization in every prototype.<p>Today these types of prototypes need to live next to the &quot;important&quot; code so that they can use the same CI pipeline and easily be made public or visible to employees and use real data.<p>I&#x27;m following projects like <a href=""https://getkong.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://getkong.org/</a> with interest, and together with everything happening around Docker such as EC2 container service or Kubernetes, as well as projects for service discover/configuration like etcd or Consul, it feels like we&#x27;re getting there.

You have a great idea, you try, it&#x27;s too complicated, after 1 year (and even that requires a lot of determination) you have not completed anything, and you actually have not mastered the language/technology.<p>It&#x27;s as if you tried to acquire fluency in ancient Greek by jumping right into reading Aristotle.<p>The point of entry is always very difficult, for any skill, and learning curve is most often steep and frustrating.<p>My advice - find someone who lives near by, someone whom you could call at any moment, and discuss your little project with him/her. Choose language/technology, and start working through some tutorials with your project in mind. Your friend should help you downsize your ambitions and limit the scope of the project to something you can actually execute.<p>You should be done with the basics in about 3 months (that means - no GUI). After that - try to limit the scope of your project so that you think you can make it in the next 3 months. (We know it will take you at least 6-9 months, but still, try to be on the schedule). Only then you will understand what it actually means to be a software developer.<p>(please note: software engineering is much more than you think when you&#x27;re just starting to learn computer programming. Coding is not just giving instructions to computer to perform simple calculations. There are design patterns, team work, efficiency, doing things on time, math, frameworks, keeping up with super-crazy pace is which everything changes, there is network issues, and mobile devices, security, scalability, and much more.

Apps have a &quot;target SDK version&quot; and a &quot;min SDK version&quot;‚Äîbasically the newest and oldest Android versions that an app supports.

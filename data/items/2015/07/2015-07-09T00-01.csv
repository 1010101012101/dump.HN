9855633,comment,9851505,9853596,0,0,catnaroek,,,"> But there is much to be said against PFP itself (and much to be said in favor) like the lack of clear execution models, the lack of clear thread context (which is, of course, related), the difficulty in analyzing computational complexity, in debugging and profiling, and implementing many simple algorithms. Many of those are related to laziness more than referential transparency itself, but RT necessitates laziness in some cases, whether the language itself is strict or not.<p>Don&#x27;t blame purely functional programming and referential transparency, which are unquestionably good ideas, for the downsides of laziness, which is indeed a bad default. Purely functional programming doesn&#x27;t need laziness, and, in fact, is much better off with a formal distinction between values and computations, as in the call-by-push-value paradigm [0]. Pervasive laziness actually has negative consequences for equational reasoning, because it forces all free variables to stand for potentially nonterminating computations. To restore the practicality of equational reasoning, Haskellers often have to pretend free variables only stand for productive computations (that big-step-reduce to a term in WHNF), but this assumption is completely unwarranted by language itself.<p>> &quot;wherefore referential transparency&quot;. If it is to avoid problems caused by shared mutable state, then there might be better ways, like making shared state transactional to some degree (Clojure, Erlang).<p>Although it doesn&#x27;t exactly have transactions, Rust&#x27;s strict aliasing and mutability controls is a much better argument for &quot;there are better ways to avoid the problems of shared mutable state&quot;. Clojure and Erlang take the easy route of making the consequences of your bugs less catastrophic [1], but do very little to actually avoid concurrency bugs.<p>> If it is to make automatic verification better, then there might be easier ways (like some of the many model-checking methods)<p>Model-checking doesn&#x27;t scale to truly large state spaces. Typeful purely functional programming is, to a large extent, about trimming the state space to exclude nonsensical stuff.<p>>  and if it is to make human reasoning better, one should ask whether equational thinking is really the best way for people to think about programs<p>Yes, equational reasoning <i>is</i> the best way for people to think about programs. Equational reasoning, being barely more complex than high school algebra [2], is so easy that a normal programmer can do it casually. The most complicated operation you ever have to perform is substitution: replacing all free occurences of a variable by an expression.<p>> (I think the human mind is much more adept at simulating state than at math, and that an essential, &quot;basic&quot; abstraction such as monad transformers is already too high-order for people to wrap their heads around)<p>The untrained human mind might be more adept at simulating a <i>single sequence</i> of states than at math. However, even the best trained human mind is <i>comically bad</i> at analyzing <i>classes</i> of sequences of states, formally or informally. In particular, in the formal case, this kind of analysis often requires using logical relations, such as weakest preconditions [3], whose bodies can contain arbitrary quantifiers. Now, as anyone who&#x27;s used formal methods can attest, <i>rigorously</i> manipulating quantifiers is a bitch - you often have to refer to their formal rules of inference, because it&#x27;s so easy to use quantifiers wrong if you rely on intuition alone.<p>> I think that because much of PL research in the last decade has been focused on PFP, people are under the impression that it is somehow more &quot;mathematical&quot; or theoretically sound (not in the logical sense) than imperative, completely forgetting that fully-verifiable, and theory-supported imperative languages (like Esterel and its descendants) have been used much more successfully in the industry than Haskell and friends.<p>You&#x27;re right that it&#x27;s perfectly feasible to ground imperative programming in a formal foundation. However, as I explained in my previous points, <i>in practice</i>, the formal techniques for reasoning about functional programs are straightforward enough to learn and use by anyone straight out of high school, whereas the techniques for formally reasoning about imperative programs are both cumbersome and subtle - that&#x27;s precisely why they aren&#x27;t used except when incorrect programs are completely unacceptable.<p>> The argument of PFP vs. imperative is important and interesting, and there are both mathematical as well as psychological arguments to be made in favor of each. However, in recent years, many have come to see imperative as pedestrian and PFP as mathematically-advanced, which is completely false.<p>Again, I partially agree. Imperative programming is far from pedestrian. It&#x27;s <i>too complicated</i>, in fact, so complicated that the only way we can cope with it is by handwaving away our proof obligation.<p>---<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pbl/cbpv.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pbl/cbpv.html</a><p>[1] Erlang&#x27;s marketing is very honest about this: Let it crash.<p>[2] The extra complexity comes primarily from the fact that high school algebra is single-sorted (all free variables are real, or at most complex), whereas equational reasoning in Haskell is multi-sorted (because Haskell has a rich type system).<p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_transformer_semantics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_transformer_semantic...</a>",1436403509

Most of the time, I&#x27;m not asked to leave, but other times, if I feel guilty, I buy something else, like another coffee or a sweet. I suppose I&#x27;d willing to &quot;rent&quot; space if it were available.<p>A funny relevant anecdote. Yesterday, I was at home trying to work, and I could not focus, so I walked to a nearby coffeeshop. Apparently, a group was filming something in half of the shop, so another section with most of the seats was closed off, as well as outside seating in front of it. Naturally, the remaining seats were full.<p>So, I randomly asked a person if I could share a seat with her. I didn&#x27;t make small talk, I just sat and read. After twenty minutes or so, she got up to leave. After a while of reading, I saw a number of people come in and be told they might have to take to-go since the place was full. I was more than willing to share a seat at my table, and a number of other tables had open seats, but no one approached me, or anyone else for that matter...<p>So, I got up, and purchased a slice of cake to-go. A gentleman who was waiting for a chair thanked me and took my place.<p>Now, on the way home, there is a chocolate shop which has a couple of seats as well. I decided to peer inside, and guess who I see in the window? The lady who&#x27;s table I took, apparently. :/<p>I guess I can&#x27;t fault other people for not being as comfortable about sharing &quot;personal space&quot; as I am, but especially in that sort of situation, it hurts more than it helps.",1436403269

In some cases that will mean spending time to make it great.  In other cases that will mean removing code that we don’t see ourselves improving any time soon. In other cases it will mean finding third party services or addons that can do the job better than we can.<p>Pay close attention to this. This change in philosophy around features and incorporating third party services is going to create a Firefox that&#x27;s radically different from releases in the past. For better or worse we&#x27;ve already started seeing these changes with the recent Pocket integration.<p>> We’re not like most organizations, so we have to partner differently. We worked with Pocket to amend their Privacy Policy to be more in line with our principles. We made sure the code that shipped with Firefox was licensed appropriately.<p>Amending Pocket&#x27;s Privacy Policy is something I was not aware of, and I think puts things in perspective. I have a little more faith in the Pocket decision now. It shows that the move was well thought out and Mozilla wasn&#x27;t a Read It Later, Inc (Pocket&#x27;s developer) pushover. Regarding the topic, Dave recognizes the community criticism later in the email.<p>> But folks raised objections, and we need to address that. Some of the objections were about policy and strategy, and I’m not going to address those in this thread.  But we did hear specific complaints about how the code was integrated.  Folks said that Pocket should have been a bundled add-on that could have been more easily removed entirely from the browser.  We tend to agree with that, and fixing that for Pocket and any future partner integrations is one concrete piece of engineering work we need to get done.  Pocket was also given first billing on the main screen, and that may not be a scalable solution.  We’re going to need to figure out how to best surface these things in our UI.<p>I admire this a lot. I just hope that future partnerships are announced well in advanced and the community has time to comment on implementation. I think integrating third party services will be an improvement, but only if executed well. Open-minded ideas like this certainly would have avoided problems like Microsoft&#x27;s negligence of IE during the previous decade.",1436402699

Unfortunately, we&#x27;ve neglected to set up any kind of traffic or performance monitoring of our API specifically. Here are some of the problems I&#x27;d like to solve:<p>* An new API client emails me, saying that a particular API call isn&#x27;t working. I&#x27;d like to be able to go into this magical traffic logger and see precisely what calls this client has made, to what endpoints, at what times, and what we responded with.
* We release a new endpoint. We&#x27;ve tested the endpoint and feel confident in it, but still, we&#x27;d like to ensure that it&#x27;s working the way we thought it was going to work in production. We should be able to go into this traffic logger, filter by the endpoint that we want, and look through the logs manually, and ensure that everything looks reasonable.
* I&#x27;d like to be able to track the performance of endpoints over time. I&#x27;d like to see statistics about error rates and response times, broken down by endpoint.<p>Here are the services that I&#x27;ve considered:<p>- 3scale/Mashery: Though it seems to satisfy my requirements, these services offer a whole suite of things that we don&#x27;t need and wouldn&#x27;t want to pay for, like monetization and authentication. Also, I&#x27;m slightly sketched out by the API proxy part of Mashery -- I don&#x27;t want our API to be dependent on Mashery being online.
- Loggly/Splunk: Maybe this is the time to jump to a big boy logging solution? Right now all our logs just live on our app servers. Perhaps I could just log some information about requests, and set up fancy filters and such inside the app itself.
- New Relic: I believe that New Relic can satisfy these requirements if configured properly. One downside is it seems to be crazy expensive.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;d love some feedback. Have any of you tackled this particular solution, and what have you done to solve it?",1436402662

Most of the things I see labelled as mansplaining I think are poor explanations that lack nuance, introspection, and social / emotional awareness, and as you pointed out they are usually condescending.  But how does it relate to my own manhood when something someone else writes is labelled as mansplaining, since I&#x27;ve also been attacked due to my membership in the class?  Am I not a real man because I&#x27;m not lacking in these things?  No, of course not.  Would I be offended if some angry person labelled my own writing as mansplaining?  Not really, they&#x27;d have to attack me on the specifics, in which case I&#x27;d listen, etc.  I would however use it as a filter indicating I should be wary of their future arguments though, just as I use other slurs as a filter.<p>In general I think it&#x27;s pointlessly divisive to invent slurs for the other side in the push for egality.

Lastly, even the wiki article goes to great lengths to emphasize &quot;usually a man&quot; and &quot;usually towards a woman&quot;.<p>Though I&#x27;m probably mansplaining right now aren&#x27;t I?

I&#x27;d wager I&#x27;m misgendered far more frequently and thus this assumption is wrong and I can&#x27;t possibly be mansplaining by its own definition.<p>The largest problem, in my biased opinion, is it misuses a negatively-loaded term against a rather lengthy reply.

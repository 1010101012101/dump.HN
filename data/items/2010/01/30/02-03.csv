If I'm working at starbucks and my bumper sticker says 'VOTE OBAMA', perhaps that would be crossing the line. What if it says 'Don't Drink Starbucks!'. Perhaps I get a job at a republican political think tank that works for the GOP? Do I really expect not to be fired if I have a bumper sticker left over saying 'vote Obama'?",1264820232

1088121,comment,1086841,1087279,0,0,marciovm123,,,"I'm not saying we don't need $3 or $30 or $300 life saving treatments.  If the treatment is worth it - if a living person generates enough wealth to cover the treatment - then of course it's good for the economy.  The fact that the polio vaccine was worth the investment is why people in America chose to put money into it.  But an outside force artificially lowering the cost of the treatment to basically zero means that you are keeping people alive that are not able to generate any wealth at all.  In fact, in a place with too many people and not enough ways for them to generate wealth (land or jobs), you are perpetuating conditions that breed violence and corruption, leading to negative wealth creation through your actions.<p>I'm not saying we shouldn't try to help, if possible - but we need to attack the right problem.  The reason we don't is that because there is a real cost to us to do so.  People who are all for money towards cheap vaccines want to help as long as it doesn't cost them anything other then their admiration.<p>""Preventing these diseases with a simple vaccine is going to give a much greater economic boost to poor countries than giving them clean energy technologies or superhighways.""<p>If America continues polluting the world to the point where temperatures rise above 2C and global climate patterns are disrupted, we will have directly caused the deaths and suffering of tens or hundreds of millions of people.  Not causing those deaths is indeed a greater economic boost then cheaper vaccines.  We need clean energy everywhere, starting with the US and China.<p>Infrastructure that supports trade is an excellent investment.  Superhighways?  That makes it sound like you've never left the suburbs, man.  These places need a road connecting their capital to everywhere else that can handle 2 lanes of traffic each way, and a port that can handle a decent size ship.  No, they don't already have that.<p>""That, sir borders on the racist. What countries are you referring to?""<p>Who said anything about races?  I'm referring to any country where managing natural resources is a substantially larger portion of the economy then leveraging human capital.  In that case, ruling elites have huge financial incentives to actively deter development of human capital.  That would be a challenge to their rule.  Their government might have ""democracy"" and laws that sound great, but at the end of the day the job of the police and military is to keep the powerful in power, and in that sense they are nothing more then a glorified gang.<p>I would believe Bill Gate's sincerity if he permanently moved to a developing country and tried building a profitable business (any business!) there.  If you want people to live a wealthy lifestyle, they need a way to generate that wealth themselves.",1264818676

Turbo Pascal came out for $50 in 1984. That's only $100 in 2009 dollars. Too bad I couldn't afford to change hardware...)<p>Now I can pay Apple $99 per year (in 2009 dollars) and get the ability to write iPhone programs, using pro-level tools, and install any iPhone program I want on my personal phone and those of my friends. Or I can build a web app in Javascript or Ruby or whatever and share it with all my friends, without asking <i>anyone's</i> permission, for $9 a month in hosting. (Or pay-as-you-go hosting on the cloud, if uptime is no concern.) Or, if I really want a machine that is completely open and ready to run Linux on, I can buy one for pocket change. I've literally given away the equivalent of three Linux PCs in the last few months because I don't have enough space in the back of my closet.<p>(The latter is a particularly important point. One reason closed hardware is growing in popularity is that there is <i>so much other cheap hardware</i> out there. Back when a computer cost $2500 it was relatively important to make sure that you could run whatever software you needed on that one computer. Now, if someone offers you a machine that's sealed against malware -- with the caveat that it's also sealed against anyone who won't pay an extra $99, including <i>you</i> -- it's a lot more tempting, because, hey, if Computer A won't run your software we can just buy Computer B, C, or D, new, for a few hundred bucks.

It takes 1.8 seconds to get to the end of the 4-variable cartesian product.<p>This was my theory, and I tested it by importing Debug.Trace, and then changing the line in question to:<p><pre><code>    let result = [traceShow [j,k,l,m] (distance j k l m) | j <- rangeLat, k <- rangeLng, l <- rangeLat, m <- rangeLng]\n</code></pre>\nThis will print ""show [j,k,l,m]"" when the actual distance is required.  When I run the program, it prints what you'd expect:<p><pre><code>    [[-90.0,-180.0,-90.0,-180.0]\n    0.0,[-90.0,-180.0,-90.0,-177.5]\n    2.2737639212328448e-32,[-90.0,-180.0,-90.0,-175.0]\n    9.095050533892612e-32,[-90.0,-180.0,-90.0,-172.5]\n    2.046381347867479e-31]\n    [90.0,180.0,90.0,180.0]\n    0.0\n</code></pre>\nThe stuff in brackets is the traceShow output, and it's mixed in with the printing of each result.  Lazy evaluation is; it calculates only what is necessary.

Others may differ on this.\nIn terms of useful applications, for doctors and for others who need convenient information retrieval, the Ipad will be great, and I welcome it.  \nOn the most part though it will just be a gadget that people will get addicted to and waste more or their worthwhile lives on.  Real work will be done on real computers (with a keyboard).",1264817029

I think lack of fun is.</i><p>I can recommend an algebra textbook with fun. And it was written by a mathematician with rather better credentials (theorems that bear his name in higher mathematics) than most algebra textbook authors.

They LOVE the Gelfand problems. They haven't even gotten to the really funny parts of the book yet, which such sections as ""How to Confuse Students on an Exam."" Gelfand's book(s) exemplify what you are looking for in math textbooks. Of course they are not used in very many public schools in the United States, nor in very many remedial college classes.",1264816903

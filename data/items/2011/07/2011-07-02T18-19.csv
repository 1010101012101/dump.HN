2722178,comment,2721963,2721963,11,0,gwern,,,">    Third, smaller servers can also lead to lower utilization. Consider the task of allocating a set of applications across a pool of servers as a bin-packing problemeach of the servers is a bin, and we try to fit as many applications as possible into each bin. Clearly that task is harder when the bins are small, because many applications might not completely fill a server and yet use too much of its CPU or RAM to allow a second application to coexist on the same server. Thus, larger bins (combined with resource containers or virtual machines to achieve performance isolation between individual applications) might offer a lower total cost to run a given workload.<p>Hey, that's a pretty good analogy!

I wouldn't care <i>which</i> company had my data if the TOS protected me enough (let's wave-away the discussion of enforcement here) where as with open-ended TOS's, my level of OK'ness with it is directly tied to the company holding my data and their behavior more than anything.<p>To me, that suggests that TOSs could benefit from some user-favoring tweaks and clarifications, especially if the company doesn't need the wide birth they have written in for themselves for particular reason.<p>To address the followup question of amending the TOSs every time a new feature ships, sure on the other extreme end of the spectrum this would be a problem; I'm suggesting something more strict than we have now, but not so strict it's ridiculous.",1309632064

If everybody behaved a particular way in all aspects of life, we'd have no need for any laws at all.  The fact that you were useful buying them and not smoking them doesn't mean other children won't do the opposite. These sort of laws have to protect the vulnerable, not build on the basis that all children are grown up enough to look after themselves.<p>As to drinking in bars, I'm not so sure. In my experience, I have, my friends have and random people I see any time I go out have been able to get very drunk without being thrown out. The only time I've seen people thrown out ""for being too drunk"" is actually when their being drunk has made them rude and/or violent, often towards bouncers. No-one I personally know has ever got so drunk that something bad happened, but I've seen no evidence that it's harder for that to be the case in a licensed bar than a field. Regardless, even if kids could drink legally, what's stopping them from, after being kicked out for being too drunk, heading to a field with a bottle of vodka?",1309631384

Judge Ware, who is a very good judge, is left to struggle with trying to determine what Congress intended when it enacted the statute 25 years ago as its text might apply to technologies that did not exist at the time.

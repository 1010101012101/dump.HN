10868169,comment,10867749,10867749,0,0,api,,,"I somewhat agree with Graham: economic inequality is not intrinsically the problem and startups are not the problem.<p>The problem IMHO is rent and profiteering off taxpayer subsidies, both of which more or less force me to pay tribute to the rich.<p>I don&#x27;t care one bit if someone else is <i>infinitely</i> richer than me as long as I don&#x27;t have to pay tribute to them or otherwise be lorded over by them. I would not care if (hypothetically) there were people alive today who were biologically immortal cognitively enhanced cyberpunk demigods with control of wealth flows in excess of present-day US GDP. In an abstract philosophical sense it seems likely that such sentient entities do in fact exist <i>somewhere</i> in our vast universe and I don&#x27;t see how this likelihood impacts me at all. There are also (statistically speaking) probably a minimum of several hundred million to a billion people smarter, healthier, and better looking than me.<p>What I do care about is being forced or at least heavily pressured/coerced into paying <i>tribute</i> to those who are above me economically.<p>A prime example: housing costs are insane and this is partly a result of rich people from around the world parking their wealth in real estate and extracting rent in exchange for little to no investment in anything productive. In general, idle rent extraction is a social ill and should be taxed to hell and back. I would support cuts to capital gains, employment, and income taxes and large increases in taxes on property speculation (non-primary residences) and other non-productive rentier activity. (We might distinguish between productive capitalism and rentier capitalism, though it&#x27;s hard to draw an absolute black-and-white distinction.)<p>Other examples of tribute include the many cases where public insurance is used to back-stop private losses while private gains remain private, such as the 2008 bank bailouts or the government paying in part for the cleanup of BP&#x27;s gulf oil spill, and cases where taxpayer subsidized research and development is privatized for exclusively private gain (and patented!). How many huge companies have been built on the back of government-funded research? (The fact that so much wealth is built on the back of public research and public infrastructure is a common argument for progressive taxation.)<p>A huge reason I&#x27;ve lost my faith in libertarian politics is that the 2008 bailouts convinced me it&#x27;s a scam. The rich advocate laissez faire until their wealth is on the line, at which point they become socialists. It&#x27;s clear to me that for the poor and middle class to forego the use of government coercion is for them to engage in unilateral disarmament. I&#x27;ve heard today&#x27;s economy described as a casino in which public funds are used to backstop the losses of the highest rollers, and that seems fairly accurate to me.<p>It&#x27;s not transformed me into a conventional liberal though. Personally I don&#x27;t think anyone on the present-day right or left has a clear path out of this. Both sides advocate things that would make the problem worse.",1452286594
10868168,comment,10867056,10867056,0,0,javajosh,,,"There is a mode of adulthood that is dangerous and worth mentioning, which is a kind of hard-hearted acceptance that the world isn&#x27;t fair, life is full of suffering, and there&#x27;s nothing you (or anyone) can do about except suck it up and keep going. There&#x27;s a kind of grim determination to continue despite not wanting to. Maybe it&#x27;s because you have people depending on you, or maybe it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re just very stubborn. To some extent, I associate this mode with the opening scene of &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot; when Daniel Day Lewis&#x27; character is injured and spares not a single moment on despair, or self-pity, and gets himself out of a miserable situation, against the odds.<p>In this mode, there is little time or urge for compassion, or play, or joy.

Startup-servicing startups. Hosting. Metrics. Food delivery. Recruiting. Hell...there are hundreds (if not thousands) of companies just doing advertising services, alone. Everyone fixates on the unicorns that are doing big revenue numbers, but the regional effects of those redwoods are tiny in comparison to the &quot;robust ecosystem&quot; of mushrooms that grows in their shadow.<p>I often wonder how much of Facebook&#x27;s revenue (for example) consists of valley startups trying to micro-target indifferent consumers.

So far, I&#x27;ve worked on this project for about 9 months and I do everything technical (server setup, back-end [our core technology], front-end web design).<p>Problem:\nWe need to make payroll two more times before we can close a large seed round which will put to rest money problems for a long duration, but the problem here is getting these last two equity-for-cash lots before we get the big relief.<p>Now with options running out, one particular solution came up. Two contributors to our startup offered to put up the next lot, but in exchange they want &quot;co-founder&quot; status on top of the equity.\nWhat I want to avoid is to have our say and leverage in the company not be proportionate to effort level put in when these two new &quot;co-founders&quot; are put into play.\nNow the founder is okay with this because in the end, he still has the final say on everything (and it&#x27;s his wife), but as an &quot;outside player&quot; I have to go to bat for myself and make sure I don&#x27;t get screwed by letting these decisions go too easily.<p>TL;DR\nAs core co-founders, will giving up additional &quot;co-founder&quot; titles have potentially nasty consequences in the future (when everybody has their own opinions)?<p>If there&#x27;s anything else I can clear up, please let me know.

10868012,comment,10860815,10866113,0,0,jordwalke,,,"It would be great to see a list of known/anticipated compatibility issues. For example, I notice that when compiling `String.set` with OCamlScript, the generated JS ends up trying to set/mutate a character in the JS string, which has no effect because JS strings are immutable. (I&#x27;ll file a github issue). I imagine there will be several small issues like this and it would be good to get a sense for how much work it would be to solve that long tail of compatibility work. In the process, I think the community can help determine if this approach could ever practically match the near-perfect level of compatibility that js_of_ocaml has achieved via byte code compilation - and whether or not it matters. To me, compatibility is very important, but so is debugability. It might be clear that it&#x27;s okay to compromise the readability of OcamlScript in order to achieve more compatibility without compromising debugability (for example, using a `new MLString(&quot;xyz&quot;)` wrapper that uses a JS `String` by default for performance, but then swaps it out upon any mutation. (Or perhaps you can limit it to programs that have disabled string mutations in later versions of OCaml).<p>The good news is that <i>if</i> you can achieve perfect compatibility with this approach, then I believe that runtime performance becomes less of a concern and OCamlScript&#x27;s job gets a lot easier. This is because, if you&#x27;ve achieved perfect compatibility, you can easily compile your project with another toolchain such as js_of_ocaml, that has equal compatibility, but (in this hypothetical scenario) had chosen to focus more on performance instead of debugability - without changing anything in your program.<p>This would free you up to not have to worry about applying any optimizations in this readable/debuggable mode - you get to focus entirely on whatever makes the development flow faster/easier. (You&#x27;d probably still want tail call optimization because order of memory usage could be considered a key part of compatibility).<p>Similarly, I wonder if the existence of a fully compatible, (hypothetically) slow runtime performance, but perfectly debugable compiler backend, would then free up js_of_ocaml from some of the constraints/work that is required to make their code output reasonably simple/debuggable. Does the existence of a fully compatible OCamlScript mean that js_of_ocaml&#x27;s job gets easier?<p>I&#x27;m excited to discuss how the two projects could potentially become an asset to each other.<p>edit: I started a discussion on Github here: <a href=""https://github.com/bloomberg/ocamlscript/issues/12"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bloomberg/ocamlscript/issues/12</a>",1452285402

I&#x27;m talking potentially an order of magnitude. This is partially because of the way people use the powders, and partially because the processing of MSG involves freeing bound glutamates. As someone who cooks with powdered MSG, I&#x27;m speaking from personal experience here - I don&#x27;t have a sensitivity to glutamate, so I cook with a lot of it. So do many other people I know.<p>>The question is whether you get a roughly equivalent dose of glutamate from common umami-forward dishes than you do from dishes where umami is added through MSG.<p>The answer is &quot;not at all&quot; for many types of food (like a typical corner Chinese restaurant, who uses powdered MSG a lot like I do).",1452285387

In all those 256^1024 pictures, you have every possible representable letter A, as well as any other possible Unicode character. In those images are all your most cherished private photos (or at least their thumbnails), and also the photos of all things that you&#x27;d wish happened but didn&#x27;t. A thumbnail of every possible photo of the universe is there as well.<p>There&#x27;s also something else. Something much more frequent than all other image I&#x27;ve just mentioned taken together. It&#x27;s the <i>noise</i>. The things we don&#x27;t recognize, the things we consider uninteresting. I ask you, use your intuition - if you were to create a random Windows icon every second, how soon would you expect to get one depicting a letter &quot;A&quot;?<p>And now realize we were talking about silly icons that are probably barely visible on your screen.<p>There are 6.02 x 10²³ atoms in 12 grams of carbon. I.e. in a tip of your pencil. 602000000000000000000000 atoms. Those are your pixels. And if you want to compute the number of states this pile of atoms can be in, that is the number that goes <i>in your exponent</i>. The base is some combination of possible positions, orientations and velocities, and then probably something else I&#x27;m forgetting right now. And <i>almost all</i> of those states are noise. That&#x27;s how the Second Rule works.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=256%5E1024"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=256%5E1024</a>",1452285090

10867933,comment,10866232,10866232,0,0,meesterdude,,,"I love the crap out of CSS, but a lot of these points are just opinion, and I would not recommend this guide to anyone who wants to write more maintainable CSS.<p>Things like calling it &quot;the best&quot; and having &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; in the examples are really just arrogant and not grounded in anything solid. In CSS, there is no right/wrong, thats the point. CSS is not black & white, it&#x27;s flexible.<p>It&#x27;s not all bad, of course; things like the spacing between the colon of a definition I thought were self evident.<p>> CSS rules should be comma separated and leave on a new line<p>Wat. Ok, sure, you CAN do that. And if you have complex selectors, you should. but for &quot;a,img&quot; theres no clarity gained by new lining them.<p>> Rule declarations should have one property per line<p>Generally yes. But there are times when a one-liner is clearer and easier to comprehend.<p>> Do not nest elements.<p>Do not listen to this! The author is correct that this can lead to over specificity, and that is certainly something you should be aware of.  But it also lets you do things like not have to put classes on everything, and focus more on what makes semantic sense in the HTML. Personally, i go two to three levels; still allows for flexibility (like moving an article to be within a div) while letting you easily scope out everything having to do with a particular element and it&#x27;s children. and code folding!<p>> You should use single quotes as it is visually clearer that the string is not a selector or a style property.<p>I agree with this; you should, it&#x27;s clearer, and allows for syntax highlighting to make it easier to spot.<p>Anyway, the best CSS is CSS you can understand, refactor, and expand upon. What CSS and CSS processors allow for is a lot of flexibility that can be abused if you&#x27;re not careful, or very powerful if you know what you&#x27;re doing. We are all students of CSS, still trying to figure out what is a good idea and what is not. Take everything with a grain of salt.<p>Take what is useful from this for you, discard the rest. But don&#x27;t count it as gospel. For those of us who&#x27;ve been around CSS, this is probably obvious; but for people just picking it up, I would discourage latching onto this as definitive.<p>If I was the author: i would actually give this a name. like &quot;super totally awesome CSS&quot; or something. then you can make sweeping right/wrong judgements and any other style declarations you want, because they are contextual to a specific philosophy and school of opinion. Like google&#x27;s material design does.",1452284729

This means objects that can be many different colors but are always strong and saturated average to a brown, as you said. And as you said, for those types of objects, it&#x27;s best to pick a random color and make it bright and saturated. The best way to have it do that is to redefine error as some metric of how &quot;realistic&quot; the picture looks vs the original. For example, a picture of a car recolored to look bright blue looks similarly &quot;realistic&quot; to the human eye as the original picture where the car is bright red. The deviation in color is high, but it still looks &quot;good&quot;, so the error should be low.

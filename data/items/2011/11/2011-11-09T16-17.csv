3216266,comment,3216263,3216263,1,0,airlocksoftware,,,"Hi there. I'm kinda new to programming, I changed majors and have only been working at it for a couple of years. I've been very inspired by some of the posts I've seen here. They kept me going to finish this project, so I wanted to share it with you.<p>I made a strength training app because I wasn't really satisfied with the user experience of the few that were already in the market. I started doing strength training about 3 years ago, and as a (previously) skinny nerd, it really changed my life. The confidence, energy, and overall feeling of health I've gained are incredible. I really believe that if you're someone who has let their health go, the biggest thing you can do to improve your programming, your startup, or your life is to get fit.<p>Now I'm not going to say that it isn't hard. It really is. Doing a set of heavy squats is definitely the hardest part of my day. But it doesn't have to take much time (1 - 1.5 hours, 3 times per week).<p>What I'm trying to do with Strength is make it simple for someone who's never weightlifted or done a squat before to get started. It helps you set up a program, and then tells you what lifts to do, how long to rest for, reminds you when it's time for a workout, etc.<p>Any feedback (or feature requests, or bug reports) is appreciated. You can email me: matt (at) airlocksoftware (dot) com<p>Thanks!",1320857964

     Oh, and don't use opacity either, since that also 
     kills performance. Seriously?
</code></pre>
The problem with the Flash player is that by design it assumes all applications have such needs, like opacity, gradients and animations, when this is not the case. Even with the drawbacks you mention, an interface built with jQTouch for example is pretty snappy on the iPhone. See the demo: <a href=""http://jqtouch.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jqtouch.com/</a><p>Android in particular is indeed having problems and I wasn't at all pleased with the results I got from jQuery Mobile. On the other hand Android has this problem with the UI in general, as hardware-accelerated graphics has been its weak point.<p>But you're comparing here the performance of browsers on mobile phones with the performance of Flash on the desktop. Adobe has yet to come up with a decent alternative for mobiles. I have Flash on my Android browser and I'm really not impressed. In fact, I deactivated it.<p><pre><code>     Things that Flash used to laugh at will bring Chrome to its knees.
</code></pre>
That goes both ways too ... try loading 5000 thumbnails in a Flash UI and compare it with Chrome. I do that whenever I organize my Flickr account.<p>Also in Chrome special effects may not be so snappy, but animations and games are doable. And they only added accelerated graphics support recently (I'm not even sure if it's enabled on my computer). Example: <a href=""http://chrome.angrybirds.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chrome.angrybirds.com/</a><p>Angry Birds is indeed not representative of what normal people will do with HTML/JS, as Rovio engineers are pretty talented. But I know dozens of games created in Flash that are less impressive and more sluggish than this Angry Birds version ... the truth is, good developers will make snappy and cool things using any technology. Bad developers won't.<p>And this may be an anecdote, but I never, ever used a Flash interface that I liked using. I even hate it whenever I'm viewing a YouTube video because it blocks my browser's normal shortcuts.",1320857944

Cheap sells, but it's a short term play.<p>Once the consumer gets the product home, they start using it. I've done a lot of telecom work, including rolling out large scale VoIP deployments for publicly traded companies. VoIP is great when it's well engineered. When you slap it on ""any old network"", it sucks. Horribly.<p>Users of this phone are going to experience horrible call quality at some point. VoIP calls over a home wireless network with zero QoS makes this a question of ""when"", not ""if"". The first time someone sends an email with a large attachment or Dropbox uploads a large file while someone is on their Republic phone, the house of cards will come crashing down. Don't believe me? Run a continuous ping to google.com and upload a large file on cable or DSL.<p>So, the message to entrepreneurs, executives, and investors is that consumers want a cheaper cell phone plan...<p>I can think of only one response: duh!<p>This is a prime example of an ""execution counts"" scenario. If Republic is successful, it will be because they solved some very difficult technical problems like automatically switching to the cellular network when network conditions degrade. I don't know of anyone doing that though. It would seem they have to solve this problem somehow. What happens if you're on a WiFi call and you leave the network area? If they pull it off, major kudos to them.<p>Other VoIP companies with large deployments face similar issues. Vonage (last time I used them) prefers that you use their router as your primary, because it has QoS rules built in. Comcast's VoIP solution works fantastically because their network is really well engineered for VoIP.<p>If Republic's plan is to simply hand a phone to users and hop on to their WiFi network, I'd anticipate catastrophic return rates and customer dissatisfaction.<p>Then again, people are cheap. Republic may find that there is a viable community of cost conscious consumers who will tolerate the occasional bad call in exchange for a low, low price.",1320857757

1. adding LINQ support to Scala via macros
2. macros virtualize XXX, where XXX = vals, vars, defs, types, classes, traits.

Children typically have shorter attention spans, and need something that they can run with quickly. They are usually not of the mind frame that says ""This is difficult now, but some day i'll be glad I know it!"". More often, it's ""This is fun to play around with, I wonder how far I can take things?"". You'd also want to start her off with something she doesn't need a lot of hard work to hit the ground running with.<p>Take for example Javascript. You could teach programming basics, such as variables and basic algebra, string manipulation including the need to escape certain text, etc. in an environment she could immediately begin to grasp the changes of. Just pop open a javascript console on any webpage in any modern browser, and she has an interactive environment where she can play, learn, and begin to see the effects of her work right away, in a very concrete fashion. Sure, she'll most likely just be breaking a webpage at first, but she'll get to see immediate results. She also wont need to struggle to learn a convoluted IDE, nor the more arcane facets of linking libraries and external resources - but she would begin to understand what they are, and be given a simple example of how they're used and why (external scripts libraries, ajax requests to load json)<p>Then once shes grasped how these things work, consider moving her onto something more abstract like Scheme. I would definitely say I wish I had more exposure to functional languages when I was learning programming, but my main issue was no one ever showed me real world examples of why you'd use them - it was always a boring, droll, academic venture into the subject. It lost me quickly, and only recently have I begun to try to get back into it. But this is only after I've spent many years developing in more OO languages, and begun to see others using functional approaches in real world ways.<p>Please keep us posted on what you ultimately decide to go with, and how it turns out (although I'm sure she has a few more years before you begin to introduce her to the wonderful world of development).",1320857017

The truth is that the current governing policies of the Communist Party of China (CPC) are not doctrinaire communism, in the Marxist-Leninist sense, but rather ""socialism with Chinese characteristics,"" as that party officially labels those policies. But the key political point, and the key motivation for many people wanting to leave China, is that the CPC is the sole ruling party and has been since 1949. Ideology bounces around, but the grip of the CPC on political power on all levels, and on all the major means of gaining economic power, is never relaxed. Mass media in China are subject to prepublication review by censors who are staff members (""cadres"") of the CPC. The most crucial distinction between crimes that are punished and crimes that are left unpunished is whether or not the crimes threaten the rule of the CPC. And many activities that are perfectly legal here and in all civilized countries of the world, such as political dissent, are illegal in China solely because they threaten the CPC's grip on power.<p>I speak Chinese. From time to time I have had the opportunity to participate in seminars with Chinese journalists in the United States, out of earshot of Chinese censors. Even today, I cannot reveal the name of one journalist who once expressed a frank opinion in the hearing of several Americans who are familiar with the situation in China. He said that if the common people of China had full access to uncensored news, the Communist Party of China would fall within a week. The huge efforts that the CPC-controlled government in China makes to set up a ""Great Firewall of China"" to control Internet access is a sign that the government greatly fears uncensored access to news for the Chinese populace.",1320856738

3216086,comment,3215210,3215608,7,0,michaelochurch,,,"The best way to learn macros is to learn a Lisp. Macros are easy to grok in Lisps. Regarding languages, I'd pick Clojure since you already know Java. In Lisp, you write ASTs directly. Syntax is very lightweight. For example, 3 + 4 * 5 is written as (+ 3 (* 4 5))-- the form compilers in other languages translate it into. The prefix notation and parentheses make parsing unambiguous; you don't have to worry about left vs. right associativity or order of operations.<p>The evaluation strategy for Lisp functions is to evaluate each of the inputs before making the function call. In the example above, (* 4 5) is evaluated first before the call to the function + even begins; once you have the intermediate form (+ 3 20) where all the parameters are fully-evaluated, the function call happens.<p>Why are macros important? Let's say that you want to write a short-circuit AND. You can't do that as a function. For example, (and false (/ 1 0)) will return false (never evaluating the right-hand expression) if you have short-circuit AND but it will raise an error (division by zero) if you don't. If that were a function, that call would (undesirably) fail. So what this means is that you can't write the short-circuiting AND as a function. You need something else that operates on <i>expression forms</i>, not values. In practice, it's a macro whose behavior is approximately like so:<p>(and <X> <Y>) => (if <X> <Y> false)<p>This is a transformation of code that happens during compilation, not a run-time function call.<p>It's worth noting that IF is <i>not</i> a function or a macro. It's a ""special form"" provided by the language. The evaluation of if-forms is not like the evaluation of function forms; some branches are never evaluated. It requires special-case handling.<p>That's one use for macros: writing control-flow primitives. There's a lot more to them as well: code generation to eliminate boiler-plate, DSL creation. Common Lisp, for example, has an object system built on macros, and a (controversial) LOOP macro that is its own DSL for expressing iterations, allowing idioms like (loop for i from 4 downto 1 collect (* i i)), which would return (16 9 4 1).<p>Macros can be very useful. They're pretty much essential because of how Lisp works, so every Lisper ends up writing a few, often to substantial benefit. That said, macros can also be abused to make write-only code. You have to be careful with them, and the maxim, ""Never use a macro when a function will do"", is certainly worth heeding.",1320855771

As it stands, I can write one app that will work on any desktop browser as well as across a growing range of mobile devices, including iOS. The performance really seems to be near native on iOS (for an example, see Defenders HD--I have no relation whatsoever with the devs but I do know it was done in flex).<p>Speaking for myself, I really like as3 and flex for certain tasks and hope Adobe doesn't abandon it as a dev platform.",1320854452

Part of finding it was checking for duplicate edges.  So I wanted a Set of tuples of reals.  Hilarity ensued.  That Java didn't have tuples was a minor annoyance.  The amount of boilerplate needed to make what was basically a struct of two floats Set'able was ridiculous.  I suspect Java is not as terrible for big projects.",1320854419

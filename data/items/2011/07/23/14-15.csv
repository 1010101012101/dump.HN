2797011,comment,2796098,2796098,1,0,viscanti,,,"Awful post.  His example for why NOSQL is ""difficult"" to start with, is a company with a huge RDBMS trying to transition.  Had they started with NOSQL, it would have been easy to architect around that from the beginning, rather than cramming it in later.  He then goes on to argue that it's much easier to transition to NOSQL later, which is the exact opposite of his example.<p>NOSQL isn't one catchall group.  There are different tools there for different jobs.  His arguments rest on the assumption that NOSQL is hard(er).  If it's not hard, and it solves a problem, then it's not premature optimization, it's just optimization.<p>There are certainly situations where using a NOSQL database to start with gives you a competitive advantage and makes things easier down the road.  This same argument is made every time a new technology comes onto the scene.  People who made a living using something else will argue that learning the new thing is too hard, and isn't worth the time.  If he doesn't want to bother with learning about new tools, that's fine, but it's silly for him to argue that learning them is pointless or a waste of time.",1311433131

They need sponsors and to get the word out there to any students that would like to participate.<p>The second annual H3 Hacking Competition will be held Saturday, August 27th 2011 at the GTRI Conference Center. This year's event coordinators decided to open it up to all students - all you need is your Student ID! More details are coming soon! In the meantime, to get the most up to date information please join our mailing list.<p>Our mailing list is here: sympa@lists.gatech.edu<p>http://www.hungryhungryhackers.org/events.html#<p>They're looking for sponsors and any kind of novel contribution you have to make.  This is a great initiative that teaches people with no experience in hacking what it is all about and gives those with experience the chance to show their stuff in a safe environment.  There are several ""flags"" that can be compromised in the competition.  The first one to capture them all wins.  There are great prizes, of course, but the real prize is creating this community IMO.<p>This is an event that will be held annually and may bring as many as 100 students this year from all over the South Eastern United States to Atlanta.  If you want to be a part of it in any capacity, please contact hungryhungryhackers@gtri.gatech.edu<p>What are your thoughts on this event?  Is this good for aspiring developers looking for job placement?  Would security firms be interested in this type of event?",1311432976

2966752,comment,2964543,2966671,1,0,JonnieCache,,,"We are confusing causes with symptoms. Anorexia may well be caused by deeper problems with the person's life, the ones you list in the quote, general sources of depression. However ""anorexia"" refers to a form of depression that manifests itself in issues with eating and weight. It is not the depression that kills patients, it's the undereating and the vomiting. Therefore it is entirely appropriate to discuss, deal with and treat the eating/food/weight aspects of anorexia patients' lives. When looking to actually cure the patient, therapists will indeed look to deeper issues in the person's psychology/environment. These will likely be specific to the patient, and so it is not really productive to discuss them in general terms accross populations. That can be dangerous, this kind of thinking is what lead to the concept of the ""schitzogenic mother.""<p>Also, this quote shows a big misunderstanding:<p><i>""Things that no amount of dieting or weight loss can cure.""</i><p>Nobody claims that weight loss can cure anoreixa. Anorexia is basically the irrational desire for weight loss. Being cured of anorexia essentially involves stopping ones extreme irrational weight loss behaviour, and it is self evident that no amount of weight loss can cure this.",1315335521

2966715,comment,2966002,2966182,3,0,scott_s,,,"I think of these as policy objects, and they only make sense when you have choices. That is, the benefit is not from pushing the logic into a new class. The benefit is from removing a switch on a policy flag, and using the runtime dispatching that the language provides. That is, instead of writing the branches yourself and keeping the current policy as a flag, class names are your policy flag and virtual methods are your branches. It pushes low-level code (if state A, do this, if state B, do this...) into the language runtime.<p>Personally, I don't make policy objects until I have two options. If I have one option, I hardcode everything because I want to do the minimal amount of design necessary. I only add in the abstractions when they're necessary.<p>In his post, this benefit was mostly an aside - ""and have them be different"" while showing one other option. Pushing logic into classes is not desirable in itself. As you pointed out, it adds layers of abstraction onto what can be conceptually simple tasks. But when you're able to remove some of your own machinery and rely on existing machinery, it's a win.<p>Although I do most of my work in C++, and I often have to create function objects - C++ has free functions, but it's often easier to pass around function objects.

Wired sure does love yellow light! Kinda odd, since this is a magazine that is, ostensibly, about modern technology; unlike say, Good Old Days.[1] What they smoothly elide is that the sensitivity of the human eye peaks at 555 nanometers. (green)[2]<p>The more red you have in your white light spectrum, the less efficient the lamp is.<p>This is a hard physical limit. No amount of cleverness will get around it-- the eye just isn't as sensitive to red light. The warmer the light, the less efficient your bulb will be. 2700K (warm-white) is pretty bad. 5500K (pure white) is okay. 7000K would be ideal, but I don't think anybody actually makes lamps with a color temperature[3] that high.<p>2.)<p><pre><code>  ...Additional colors and increased brightness required more nuanced control \n  of layer composition and depth. Modern LED makers accomplish this by using \n  precise ratios of indium, gallium, aluminum, and nitrogen for the crystal \n  layer, which results in a bluish color.\n\n  But on their own, not even advanced LEDs can produce anything suitable for \n  the living room. The blue-tinged illumination is fine for, say, a pen \n  flashlight on a keychain, but it doesnt come close to the warm light the \n  human eye desires.\n\n  So the LEDs found in current household applications are blue diodes daubed \n  with a powdered coating called a phosphor, which includes rare-earth \n  elements that filter blue light.\n</code></pre>\nNot <i>wrong</i> so much as massively, massively misleading. Early white LEDs were also phosphor laminated, because LEDs are monochromatic devices. There's no way to get broad-spectrum light out of them otherwise. These phosphors, by the way, are the same coatings that produce the ""awful, sickly"" light in the CFLs Dan hates so much. LED phosphors run off of blue light, not ultraviolet, but the principle is the same.<p>---<p>1: Actual magazine, that actually exists. <a href=""http://www.goodolddaysmagazine.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.goodolddaysmagazine.com/</a><p>2: <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Luminous_efficacy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Luminous_effi...</a><p>3: <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Color_temperature"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Color_tempera...</a>",1315334952

2966710,comment,2964543,2965294,2,0,JohnsonB,,,">In other words, you missed the point entirely: this is more continued evidence-free speculation,<p>Actually it's not evidence-free, it is a simple application of evolutionary theory. The ""point"" of the OP's post, as he stated directly, was that there was no ""evidence"" supporting the theory that observed gender difference are biologically caused. Pointing out that different brain structures between male and females means different behavior that would necessarily be observable directly refutes that point.<p>> complete with hand-wave theorization that there has been a gender-based task division matching the dominant Western religious-driven socialization for hundreds of thousands of years<p>Again, application of theory. Tens of thousands of years ago, our low level of technological development <i>necessitated</i> specialization. A family back then would have no other option than division of tasks based on gender because, for example, someone had to stay close to camp and care for children and someone had to go out on the physically more demanding food gathering tasks. Which genders do you think would do what? If you can visualize some way it would be more efficient for the males to constant shuttle back to camp from a hunting trip to tend the baby instead of just staying out as the job required, or for the females to do the hunting with their significantly less muscular bodies and the males to tend to the infants at camp without breasts, then by all means, do. Otherwise its a fairly obvious conclusion to be drawn from simple establish facts (women are statistically less muscular, men don't have breasts.)<p>>It's highly likely that there are measurable differences in the capabilities between male and female brains but neuroscience is very far from being able to explain anything high-level enough to start speculating about the complex skills relevant to these discussions<p>Who said anything about ""high-level"" being the criteria? You seemed to have pulled that qualification out of thin air.<p>>The other major confound is that many people rely on MRI data to support claimed differences and even assuming that the technology is precise enough and the relevant brain structures well understood enough<p>That misses the point, we don't have to understand the brain structure to know that a physiological difference in the brain will cause behavior differences, it's functionally necessary. You don't have different brain structures without an equivalent differences in behavior. It's also not important that we can't detect less significant differences in brain physiology because MRIs aren't more precise than they are; they have a specific scanning resolution and can therefore detect features reliably that are above the minimum resolving dimensions of the MRI. Those are the features being talked about here.<p>And as far as the assertion that some of these brain differences are caused by nurture, there are simply some gender based brain differences that are too consistent and develop too early to be explained by anything as variable as culture or upbringing.<p>>Finally, ""Evolution put those differences in brain structure for a reason"" demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the mechanism: there are many, many examples of things which exist by accident<p>Actually, <i>that</i> is a fundamental misunderstand of evolutionary mechanisms, it is essentially impossible to have reliably observed features in a species that are not caused by evolutionary benefit. A side effect feature which you are proposing is a moot point, because side effect features are still connected to some other distinct feature that is beneficial evolutionary, and if the side effect feature is only observed in one gender then the primary-beneficial feature which causes it is still also in one gender only, and we are still in a situation where one gender is different from another via physiological brain differences.",1315334854

Instead, influences the org by his hiring decisions, editorial policies and culture.<p>Arguably, those hiring decisions, editorial policies and culture are what has brought such success to this org. That, plus a powerful brand that this leader established from the beginning.<p>To continue the success of this org means replicating these factors. The brand is already established, but the system that sustains its success should remain as much as possible.<p>The current team also has a wide soapbox and strong opinions. If the owners of this org believes that the current team is necessary for its sustained success, then the owners will need to appease this team and involve them in the recruiting process of a new leader (if it decides to dismiss the current leader).<p>The risk of not appeasing this team is a loss of talent. It's certainly possible to recruit new blogging talent, though the current team has significant individual brand equity and established relationships. The org's owners will need to weigh the pros and cons of this as they make their decisions.",1315333707

2966561,comment,2964543,2964543,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Folks, this thread has a lot of confused thinking that is dangerous; we need the thinking in this thread to be more clear.<p>First reality check.  There is an old remark about research in psychology, that all the results either (1) are solid science that, however, say next to nothing important about humans or (2) say something important about humans, however, are junk as science.<p>Similarly, for the main issue here, that is, for what is necessary in sex differences, for the role of nature versus nurture, etc., the results from solid science won't be very important and the very important results won't be solid science.  Net, to address the issue scientifically, so far we are STUCKO.  Sorry 'bout that.<p>Second reality check.  On the issue of the OP, that is, how to treat girls, young women, and women, each person WILL necessarily take some position.  That is, no one gets to decline to choose an answer.  We MUST have an answer.  We do not have the luxury of no answer, and, from the first reality check, the answer we take on the important parts of the issue will not be from solid science.  Sorry 'bout that.<p>Solid science is great stuff.  However, quite generally in life, we have to make decisions without solid science.  Sorry 'bout that.<p>Third reality check.  I can assure you that it is actually fairly easy to get things very wrong in treatment of females, and the consequences can be from awful down to fatal.  I exaggerate not.  I can use Google Earth to give you the coordinates of the tombstone.  So, the issue here is SERIOUS.<p>There is a moral issue:  Men don't want to be unfair or cruel to the females.  So, here's a practical resolution:  Give the girls plenty of opportunity.  Give them dolls and also erector sets, white bedroom furniture and also a basketball goal, tell them they are cute, sweet, pretty, darling, adorable, and precious and also explain TCP/IP, DNS, and POP 3, encourage them in both English literature and physics, in both art history and solid geometry, have them help you make chicken salad and also put the snow tires on the car, mop the kitchen floor and also sweep out the garage.<p>Some people who have tried this practical resolution came to a conclusion:  The little girls quickly, strongly moved toward the stereotype for cute, sweet little girls.  They played with the dolls and ignored the erector set; they liked art history much more than solid geometry; they were eager enough to mop the kitchen floor but wanted nothing to do with the garage.  They were much more eager to be a cooperative member of a group than to strike out on some curiosity driven, independent, creative investigation.<p>Important information about the girls?  Yes.  Solid science?  No.  Did I mention that quite generally in life, we have to make decisions without solid science?<p>But more is possible:  If parents and society push and shove, keep telling the girls to 'perform' well at 'boy activities', then, girls, being eager to please and more obedient, often will.  If push them to be independent, autonomous, assertive, self-sufficient, and equal and to resent dependency, passivity, membership, partnership, subservience, etc., then through, say, college, they will.  My experience is that, then, too likely (granted, not always) you will find that you have created a VERY 'mixed up' young woman and a weak, sick, or dead limb on the tree and conclude that Mother Nature considered all such issues long before you did and that it's not nice to try to fool Mother Nature.<p>Here's an easier approach:  If only from an 'asymptotic' consideration, place value on her being a strong limb in the tree.  Do a really good job taking care of her until can help her find a really good husband, and then help her husband continue to take very good care of her and her children.  Have her be good as a wife and mother in a secure, strong family.  This thought, perhaps now with feminism really offensive, is not original with me.  Instead, in the ""Foreword"" to<p>Maggie Scarf, 'Intimate Partners:  Patterns in Love and Marriage', Random House, New York, ISBN 0-394-5585-X, 1987.<p>Dr.  Carol Nadelson, past president of the American Psychiatric Association, wrote:<p>""Traditional marriage is about offspring, security, and caretaking.""<p>If want her to be quite active between her ears and especially busy and productive, then emphasize to her and help her in how much there is to know about helping her children with their emotional, rational, psychological, social, artistic, physical, practical, verbal, quantitative, manual, scientific, technological, and creative problem solving development and understanding of history, business, the economy, people, groups, society, politics, etc., how far and away the most important influence on them, for their academic performance and nearly everything else, is the nurturing they get at home, and how important it is to build and have a secure, strong family and how she can play a central role there.  Indeed, she might just take on doing a good job home schooling her children through, say, the International Baccalaureate program, high SAT scores, etc.  Let the children get through the Beethoven piano sonatas and the Bach unaccompanied violin pieces, Rudin's 'Principles of Mathematical Analysis', Royden's 'Real Analysis', Breiman's 'Probability', and the 'Feynman Lectures on Physics' -- should keep them busy for a while!<p>What do you want?

If there were just a few dominant cultures historically who happened to have a patriarchal bias and which went on to be profoundly influential over a large volume of the planet (like, say, the Romans, the Chinese, etc), it stands to reason that male-female relationships in the many, many cultures that were shaped by them would simply happen to exhibit these traits, not because of biological constraints, but because of simple historical happenstance. Cultures which failed to fit this mold would be ""civilized"" when they came into contact with the dominant cultural hegemony, and relatively few counter-examples would survive.<p>Thus we can find in small, isolated pockets surviving cultures like the Aka, who split ""nuturing roles"" equally and fail to fit your hypothesis, but outside of extremely isolated cases it is hard to find cultures that run counter to what you perceive as biological norms precisely because it is hard to find any culture that wasn't extensively re-shaped by contact with one of a handful of historically dominant civilizations",1315332172

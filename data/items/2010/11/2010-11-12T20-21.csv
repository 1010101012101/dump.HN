1899251,comment,1897994,1898591,0,0,Natsu,,,"> Do players really build all that, or does the ingame AI make those decisions?<p>The AI controls the dwarves, the players issue directions.  The ASCII is a bit hard to read, but there are plenty of graphical tile packs.  I like Phoebus right now, but Mayday & Ironhand's graphics are also nice.  Look for something called the ""Lazy Newbie Pack"" and then at the tutorial threads if you ever want to get started.<p>Also, you can lock doors and such.  It won't stop building destroyers or thieves (kobolds), but everyone else will just sort of walk up to it and wonder what to do.  Dwarves can only destroy doors and other stuff when they go crazy, which tends to happen if they're unhappy enough.<p>> Jeez, the fortresses can become pretty massive.<p>Actually, that's pretty small, these days.  This was also done on an old version that had maybe 40 levels to dig through.  New ones are more like 200 unless you change settings.  Oh, and there's a magma sea at the bottom.  Magma is very Fun(TM) so more than a few players (including me) have constructed gigantic pump stacks with ~100 iron pumps powered by perpetual motion devices that pump magma up near the surface where it can be used for traps / forges / Fun(TM).<p>That game is a succession game (everyone plays for one year, taking over for the last person, so they may be surprised ... and appalled ... at how people before them have been running the fortress).<p>The comment about dwarf bread being a lethal throwing weapon is, sadly, true.  But everything is (was?) a lethal throwing weapon:  the throwing skill was completely broken.  You could throw anything (and I mean <i>anything</i>) that you could actually hold at someone and have it be deadly once you had enough throwing skill.<p>Anyhow, the jokes get a lot funnier when you understand how the game is played.  For example, there once was a weaponsmith who ran outside to grab a sock someone had dropped outside.  He got ambushed by a kobold who had a copper knife.  The kobold attacked him and cut his finger a tiny bit, then ran away.  The weaponsmith hobbled back to the fortress, making a big deal about his minor injury.  Then he decided to faint from the pain while on one of the weapon traps near the entrance.  Normally, dwarves can walk over their own traps just fine.  But if you faint?  You get chopped to bits by the trap.  At least he's not in pain now.  I set up a coffin for him.<p>As for the comments about the elephants, they used to be deadly (as were carp... yes, the fish... it's now an in joke).  So he trapped one of the elephants who had been killing folks in a cage trap, then traded it to the humans.  Due to yet another bug, any animal that had killed dwarves could be ""tamed"" and yet it would continue to attack dwarves who believed it to be ""tame"" even as it was killing them and who wouldn't fight back.  So, that elephant they gave them was dangerous...",1289595558

1899243,comment,1893686,1895520,0,0,sedachv,,,"""You're right. Scheme implementations usually have unboxed fixnums and other types. However Scheme systems do not usually support user defined unboxed objects, like C#, C and ML do.""<p>That's because Scheme has to support type safety for arbitrary code loaded at run-time. Exactly like JavaScript has to do when the web browser GETs a script. Exactly what any of the other proposed ILs would have to do as well.<p>""I agree, I did mean tail calls. Tail calls may not be so good for programming with, but they are good for compiling to, because you can easily encode your control structures like while, for, until, state machines and more exotic forms of looping to them. You can also compile (parts of) code in continuation passing style without blowing the stack, which is hard to do efficiently if you don't have tail calls.<p>The reverse is not true, you cannot easily express tail calls on top of the usual control structures like while. This is why Scala and Clojure still don't have support for tail calls.""<p>A better argument can be made for gotos than tail calls in this case. JavaScript already has gotos in the form of labels and break.<p>Tail call faking doesn't always have to have a trampoline overhead cost. Take a look at Scheme2JS for how they do it (<a href=""http://www-sop.inria.fr/indes/scheme2js/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-sop.inria.fr/indes/scheme2js/</a>)<p>""I'm not arguing that Java is better than Javascript for programming in. It's just a better target for compilers.""<p>JavaScript provides run-time types and extensive reflection and introspection facilities. This makes it relatively straightforward to write something like Parenscript. OTOH trying to compile even a static subset of Common Lisp to C or Java is pretty complicated.<p>""Do you have any arguments to back up why ML would not be a better IL than JS?""<p>Your original statement was: ""I challenge you to find a language that would have been a worse choice than Javascript."" Given the state of ML implementations in 1995, I think it would have been a worse choice.<p>""It seems to me that you are arguing that these languages are not better than JS for programming in, but that is not what I claimed.""<p>And you seriously think people would have first run out and built compilers from other languages to the ""hypothetical better than JavaScript"" language rather than use the latter directly? Because that's not what actually happened.",1289595330

It can pretty much be considered ubiquitous -- any platform worth its salt has a robust HTTP client. HTTP is reasonably light weight and extensible and is generally well understood.<p>But is it still appropriate for ""modern"" uses? As web apps become more and more interactive, larger, and have different constraints on connectivity is there a better alternative to base our stack on?<p>We have a few interesting solutions to those problems that have been built on top of HTTP. Comet, for instance, overcomes the interactivity bit and web sockets could be cool if it ever get full support but those both seem like hack-y solutions -- solutions that required a lot of energy that likely could have been mitigated if we used a different protocol in the first place.<p>Lets just consider, for the purposes of this discussion, what the ideal technology would be. We don't necessarily need to talk about adoption or deployment or feasibility -- obviously its pretty damn infeasible to ACTUALLY replace HTTP thanks to its ubiquity -- but just ideally, what would you like to see?<p>Anyone know if any feasibility studies or scoping of a technology has been done on this topic?",1289595152

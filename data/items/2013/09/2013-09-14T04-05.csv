I don&#x27;t want to criticize the kid, I just hate the sort of bullshit articles which have been screwing up my view of the world for my entire life in an attempt to sell eyeballs.I&#x27;m happy for the kid getting exposure which may end up with giving him an opportunity that few people in this world get (even in the U.S.) That&#x27;s the craziness of luck.<p>I will just go ahead and say that I would place myself more on the idiot end of the spectrum rather than genius end. Yet, if a 15 year old kid were to show off the same things I know, that kid would be praised as a genius. What I know isn&#x27;t rocket science, it&#x27;s just a huge number of small, very easy things learned from many hours of determination to learn something.<p>Unfortunately, I never had this determination for anything in school. I had a stumble on the opening path to where I&#x27;m at today almost by accident. Perhaps that&#x27;s the difference between what this article is referring to as genius and whatever this article might think of kids who aren&#x27;t genius. Maybe the author could give us a term for it.<p>Hacker news discussions have talked about the 10X programmer and how that programmer perhaps should be paid 10x more than everyone else. But I agree with the counter arguments that programmers who aren&#x27;t contributing are overpaid rather than the 10x programmer being underpaid.<p>I think we could apply this to schools as well. These kids aren&#x27;t genius, but rather, it&#x27;s school&#x27;s which are failing to help kids find their own path to something they can be passionate for. The things this kid is doing may sound like some big step for someone who is non technical, but it&#x27;s amazing what anyone can achieve with a bit of time and drive (and not having to deal with the issues of poverty.)",1379133772

Well, I don&#x27;t want to open a can of worms but:<p>a.) biologically, men simply are predisposed for greater physical strength than women.

Most contemporary estimates for the carrying capacity of the Earth under existing conditions are between 4 billion and 16 billion. <i>Depending on which estimate is used, human overpopulation may or may not have already occurred</i>. Nevertheless, the rapid recent increase in human population is causing some concern. The population is expected to reach between 8 and 10.5 billion between the year 2040 and 2050. In May 2011, the United Nations increased the medium variant projections to 9.3 billion for 2050 and 10.1 billion for 2100.&quot;",1379133110

6384634,comment,6384223,6384223,1,0,geuis,,,"I&#x27;ve got a controversial point of view on this topic.<p>Premise 1. Sexual harassment, as a term, is a relatively modern one. The dominant position of males in most societies has been so for thousands of years, though the extent to what we would identify as abuse <i>now</i> varied(s) from society to society.<p>Premise 2. In modern Western society, and increasingly in other societies influenced by the West, sexual harassment is a sociological behavior that is now considered negative for the most part.<p>Based on these two premises, I argue several positions. First, the behavior identified as sexual harassment stems from some part of genetic influences on cultural behavior. Second, we are not mere genetic automatons and our culture has a huge influence over the expression of behavior in individuals. Third, changes in culture, over long periods of time (centuries) will cause sexual selection preferences that result in mild but significant modifications of genetic predispositions to certain behaviors in the members of a human society.<p>At a high level, the recognition of sexual harassment as a point of contention in modern society is important. It is a sociological phenomenon. If the idea has enough influence to influence the mating behaviors of enough people over a long enough period of time, we will the changes genetically towards individuals who are more biased towards being less aggressive towards women.<p>In the meantime, if this is something we want to see happen more permanently in our species, we must keep up the fight against this crap for a long time. Right now, we have to choose intellectually that its bad to discriminate and harass. And if that&#x27;s a good evolutionary fit for our survival, then our future generations of offspring will be much kinder and gentler souls by default.",1379132077

I&#x27;m not so sure if the (extremely corrupt) Mongolian government is investing wisely in modern infrastructures (streets in Mongolia are usually dangerously terrible)... it&#x27;s more that the population is very interested in shiny smartphones and having a working network is a prerequisite to make them work.

6384605,comment,6384181,6384181,8,0,error54,,,"Having suffered from this before I can say this: sleep paralysis is absolutely terrifying. Whenever this occurs there is a small, rational part of your brain that tells you that nothing is wrong but this is drowned out by the absolute certainty that something or someone is just about get to you and you can&#x27;t even move to defend yourself. It&#x27;s a very primal fear unlike any other I&#x27;ve experienced and I find interesting is that it&#x27;s a common theme across people who&#x27;ve also suffered from sleep paralysis.<p>I&#x27;ve experienced lucid dreaming as well and I can assuredly say that it is nothing like sleep paralysis. The physiological effects might be similar but there&#x27;s a very big difference between consciously deciding to do something and waking up to a nightmare.",1379131353

They panic and aspire water, long before they reach critical O2 levels and pass out.<p>It&#x27;s possible to train and control the instinct to breath though. It&#x27;s a great self-control exercise, and it&#x27;s safe to try it outside the water. Try this:<p>Fill your lungs and hold your breath for as much as you can. You&#x27;ll notice an irresistible urge to let go and breath (this is when most people panic, even though O2 levels are not anywhere critical yet). If you ignore your brain and keep holding, you&#x27;ll notice involuntary movements in your diaphragm, forcing you to breath (this is when people drown). If you <i>still</i> keep holding, you&#x27;ll notice the diaphragm movements get more intense, up to a point when it&#x27;s impossible to keep holding your breath, but it takes a while still.<p>With enough practice, you learn to stay relaxed and post-pone those reactions as much as possible. After a while, you start being capable to hold the breath many times longer than expected. If you couple this technique with exercises for increased lung capacity and cardio (for lowering your base BPM), you&#x27;ll be free-diving like a champion.",1379131319

And I think there was a recent court decision that says that police need a warrant to put a GPS tracker on someone&#x27;s car. What they did here was to install malware on thousands of machines, without any probable cause to believe that any <i>specific machine owner</i> was involved with child porn. If I understand the law correctly, they would need to obtain a specific warrant for each machine they wanted to search.<p>Let&#x27;s say that there was a store in a neighborhood that was known to sell child porn. No judge would sign a warrant that gave police permission to put a GPS device on every car in that neighborhood to track whether they ever visited that store (and they may have visited but bought only legal merchandise). So why is it different if you do it on the internet?",1379131245

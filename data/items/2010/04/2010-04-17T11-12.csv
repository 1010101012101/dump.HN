1272942,comment,1272741,1272783,0,0,Zak,,,"After thinking about it for a while, I think the reason developers are so upset over 3.3.1 isn't just its direct effects. I think that many developers hoped that Apple would make the App Store more open over time. 3.3.1 is a clear sign that the opposite is more likely.",1271505364

There is just no way that Apple would make this kind of ""switch"" for their desktops or laptops. The closest plausible scenario would be a switch for their XServe segment, to bring more cores to them at a lower cost.<p>I am 100% certain that the next time Apple makes a brand/manufacturer switch of CPU in their desktop/laptop segment, you will see ARM written all over it.",1271505246

Things are a little different at the high end - I think an Opteron-based Mac Pro might be realistic. The new 12-core Opterons are more energy efficient than the latest 8-core Xeons, and roughly equally fast.<p>But then, if the top brass are negotiating <i>now</i>, real products are probably at least a year away, if not more, so who knows.",1271503751

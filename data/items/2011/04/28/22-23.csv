2495488,comment,2495137,2495237,4,0,jasonlotito,,,"> The problem with vote counts is that two downvotes can start a cascade of reflex downvotes.<p>So? As you said, this is usually corrected.  And, if points don't matter as so many people want to suggest, where is the harm in having some indicator of a posts quality.  Please note indicator does not mean points.<p>I've been suggesting for some time now that high quality posts should be marked in some manner.  No, rising to the top of the page is not a good manner, as it only affects parent posts.<p>Downvoted posts already get this treatment, even under the current system.<p>In fact, without some sort of quality indicator, points are useless.<p>Finally, their is a lot of discussion about how lack of points force people to read and research.  That's all well and good, but I'm smart enough to know that I can't research everything, and their is value in knowing what the community thinks of a topic.  It helps to steer me in the right direction.<p>Basically...<p>If you aren't going to use points to highlight good comments, then having points is useless, and they only serve those who think karma is worth anything.",1304031586

The new MacBook Airs arguably have the best-designed hardware of any laptop on the market, but I object to certain hacker-unfriendly steps Apple has taken: namely, the use of pentalobular and triwing screws to make disassembly difficult.  I cannot in good faith buy a computer from a company that so actively dissuades tinkering.<p>I've decided to go with the ThinkPad X220 instead.  Although it's not quite as svelte as the Air, it is designed to be user serviceable.  Hell, Lenovo publishes a manual with instructions on how to replace the system board (including details such as the torque each screw should be tightened to).

I've never seen anyone lose a job because of caffeine.<p>I mean, I know plenty of people who use marijuana occasionally on the weekends and seem no worse for wear;  from my understanding, it's not as bad as alcohol, and you may be right that it's not addictive, but it's certainly more harmful than Caffeine.<p>>but it doesn't change the fact that if you cut it out for a few weeks, you'd be more productive without the cost, dependency or negative side effects of coffee.<p>This is not true for me.    Personally, I tend to ramp up my caffeine use slowly over a number of months, because I do develop a resistance.  During these months, I am /significantly/ more effective than without caffeine, even if I quit for months.<p>Now, I do build up a resistance, so every few months I quit for a while, as I do eventually get to the point where I have diminishing returns.  For me, this doesn't result in headaches, just a few days of more sleep than usual and reduced performance.  Assuming I get my 12 hours a day of sleep, the reduced performance is still much better than, say, a hangover.  I'm up to baseline performance within a week.

4146224,comment,4145179,4146087,2,0,RobAley,,,"With regards to consistency, aside from the fact that I don't think its easy or necessary to compare how functions deal with arguments to how syntax operators etc. deal with values, the situation prior to this change was that there was no consistency even within core functions themselves, before you even start to consider the rest of the language. This could have been resolved by changing all the other functions rather than these few, but that would have messed up a lot more userland code than this change did. I think it was the most pragmatic way of dealing with the issue.<p>With regards to the documentation, I'll concede that it could have been better. The previous behaviour was undefined and completely undocumented, so I think there are lessons for both ""sides"", 1) for the PHP team : fully document all changes, even to previously undefined/undocumented cases 2) for the users : don't implement functions in ways that are not documented (and/or santize input/validate output from functions used in such ways).<p>Also I don't think its strictly correct to say that strings ""are compatible"" with floats in PHP, rather that in most (but not all) cases strings will be treated/parsed down as floats.",1340362706

Very broadly useful things that lots of people have the expertise to contribute to, where the costs of contribution are low.</i><p>I don't think I have to assume that.  Individuals have to limit themselves to such contributions, but companies can make the bigger ones.  The question is, would they? I think they would, because I doubt many such investments cannot be paid for without a (temporary) state granted monopoly.<p>(Now, if you <i>abolished</i> patents overnight, that could spur a sense of loss, which would indeed have a temporary chilling effect on innovation.)<p>> <i>In such a scenario, the patent isn't a ""reward"" for innovation, but simply a legal abstraction that makes certain types of business arrangements practical.</i><p>Then, I would investigate the value of such business models.  Specialization is good, but I think the <i>additional</i> specializations allowed by patents are hitting diminishing returns.<p>I would also investigate other means to enable such business models.  If they can be achieved without patents (your example suggests trade secrets would work too, if Apple, Samsung, etc signed non-disclosures agreement to the same company), then that's one more argument against the patent system: between the patent office, the difficult suits and counter-suits, and the lawyers that work on this full time, the sheer organizational cost to society is substantial.  If trade secrets can do the same more efficiently (I think it can in your example), then I say let's kill the unnecessary work!",1340359456

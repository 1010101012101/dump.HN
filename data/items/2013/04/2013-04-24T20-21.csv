I think, though, cautionary tales do have some value - and hopefully allow a small silver lining to the accompanying cloud.<p>In this is, as the post outlines, an important lesson to founders from the sales/marketing side to not oversell yourself, not just to others but to yourself.  This is part of the reason many VCs are reluctant to back companies founded by pure sales people, because such folks will oversell their own ideas to themselves and not look as critically.  You MUST get to grips with fundamentals.  You MUST understand the financial details of your business and not hand that responsibility off to someone else.  I would also argue, though many disagree, that you MUST understand on some level of detail the engineering behind your product, even if you are not the level of coder your engineering team members hopefully are.<p>Pitching ability is necessary but not sufficient qualification for success as a startup founder.  It's a very sad situation when someone pitches so far ahead of the curve they feel like they have no way out.  Depression and despair is a frighteningly common situation to find yourself in as a founder.  Help yourself by owning knowledge of all aspects of your business and THEN let the subject matter experts own the deep dive and the execution on those.",1366837030

5603906,comment,5603145,5603787,3,0,taliesinb,,,"There is already HadoopLink. LibraryLink allows you to write C or C++ that gets dynamically linked into the kernel at runtime (no restart required), which gives you freedom to create your own threads and do your own thing [and crash the kernel]. A lot of kernel development happens that way now.<p>You can even <i>synthesize</i> C code from Mathematica (there is a symbolic subset of C in it already) and have Mathematica run the appropriate build process for you, so things can get pretty interesting with that alone.<p>Out-of-core processing of large datasets is already on the roadmap for Mathematica 10. We plan to have a domain-specific language to describe and work with external [or in-memory] datasets in an efficient way, translating as appropriate to the native database query languages. Our 'native' format will be HDF5.<p>Ultimately, though, I think we'll rely on code generation to compile Mathematica to LLVM or transpile it to Go, so that we can distribute chunks of computation out to a cluster using M as command-and-control.<p>The idea would be that you can create and test large processing pipelines <i>from inside</i> Mathematica and then distribute them across a cluster in an ad-hoc way, then visualize the progress, track errors, and analyze the results. Notebooks are really good for that kind of lightweight UI.<p>This isn't a new idea, but in a language as dynamic as Mathematica, I think it could be especially powerful. Of course, it is also tricky because type inference would be a big part of making this idea possible in a dynamically typed, symbolic language like Mathematica. But not impossible, I don't think. And functional languages already have demonstrated advantages in this type of situation -- take stream fusion in Haskell.",1366836900

The concept is so fundamental that you can explain it to first-graders as soon as they're introduced to a number line.<p>Sure, he understood it. Did he respect it as the prime directive? It seems not. But, plenty of companies would take the same approach and write down the losses to the cost of customer acquisition--pure marketing--with the idea being to recoup later.<p>That drive, BTW, is a side effect of high-pressure SV culture. Rather than build more methodically with an emphasis on creating rabidly loyal fans who are willing to pay a higher price for service, customer experience, etc, the goal was to grow revenue and customer base as quickly as possible by any means. In this case, it meant deep discounting.<p>So, instead of a simple misunderstanding of margin, the problem here seems to be more that this pressure caused him to embark on a strategy ill-suited to his product. Once he'd trained his customers to expect discounts so deep that he couldn't possibly profit, there was no turning back. It seems, instead, that the Zappos model would have been more suited to his offering.<p>But the relentless pressure for growth combined with the belief that he had access to more capital seems most responsible for his approach. I think it's possible that many rational people would have been lulled into making the same mistake, even with a clear understanding of margin. To  say that he didn't understand that you have to sell a product for more than it costs to profit is nearly insulting.",1366836143

Cross-referencing an article with social data, however, is very low-hanging fruit and at the same time, pretty useful.<p>For example, take a post like the currently popular ""Introduction to Position Based Fluids"" (<a href=""http://physxinfo.com/news/11109/introduction-to-position-based-fluids/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://physxinfo.com/news/11109/introduction-to-position-bas...</a>)<p>An extractor is immediately going to have a problem here because most of the meat is in the video...there is some descriptive text, but it doesn't add much more than the title and the meta description (""Position Based Fluids is a way of simulating liquids using Position Based Dynamics (PBD) approach"")<p>However, the top HN comments are insightful...for example:<p>""The only uncanny valley effect here is that the water doesn't wet anything - everything is perfect Teflon. So it's hard to judge whether the movement of the water is perfectly realistic, because I keep looking at the transitions. If I don't look at surfaces, it seems very convincing.""<p>And since the mechanism is the same, why not extract the top comment from Reddit?<p>""Wow. Not much else to say but wow.""<p>OK, not that great in this case...but the retrieval work is trivial. More importantly, both of these sites have built in meta data telling you the value of each comment...not just upvotes, but how much discussion it generated...there are plenty of useful ways to slice this data numerically...And the same pattern would apply to Twitter/Facebook...pull in the comments/reactions from users with high social cred.<p>In other words, why resort to machine-summarization when you have perfectly fine humans to do so, and who are actually (in some cases) adding new insights?<p>And there's nothing stopping you from applying text-mining to the social data/commentary you've collected...for example, showing only comments that directly refer to the main keywords/proper nouns that are in the article (this will keep your algorithm from collecting comments like: WOW, AWESOME!! that get upvotes merely for being positive).<p>Anyway, this seems like an easier route with a lot of value...maybe it's so obvious and technically easy that it's not sexy...but I think it would be very useful.",1366834091

The two reasons seem to be first, it's not clean and second, it's easy to introduce security issues.<p>If I want to have a page that has both server-side templating and client-side templating, I push the ng-app directive down into the DOM and assert that Angular has ""ownership"" of that portion of the page. I can't remember what Django's templating engine supports, but in Jinja2, you can create a {% raw %} {% endraw %} block that tells Jinja2 not to parse any delimiters in the block (I'm sure Django has something like this, I just can't recall what it is).

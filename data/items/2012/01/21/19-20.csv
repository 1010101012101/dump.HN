3494395,story,,,50,20,robertwalsh0,"Show HN: Scholastica, Academic Journal Publishing Platform & Scholarly Community",,"Were a startup called Scholastica(http://bit.ly/rSYdfa), an academic journal publishing platform and scholarly community. We applied to Y-Combinator Spring 2011, PG actually wrote us to ask us some further questions, but unfortunately didnt get in. With that said, we didnt give up and have an application with some traction. Were completely bootstrapped and would love for you guys to check us out and hear your thoughts.<p>Problem:Academics spend their time doing research, then have other scholars peer-review this research at an academic journal, then journals hand over the articles they choose to publish to a publishing house. The publishing house then sells this content back to university libraries at ridiculous prices. Its been this way for decades and scholars are finally complaining about it in the press. For more, see the further reading section at the end of this post.<p>Solution: Scholastica is designed to give publishing power back to scholars. With Scholastica, scholars can create peer reviewed journals, find reviewers, incentivize them to give quality and on time reviews, and ultimately publish the work online without the need for large publishing companies that are holding university libraries hostage (65% of a university librarys budget goes toward buying journals). Also, in the real world, academics build status by discussing knowledge. As a result of this, Scholastica has a section of the application called The Conversation (http://bit.ly/rADIay), where in a way similar to a StackExchange or Quora, academics can dissect and share knowledge amongst themselves. Journals can then identify promising peer-reviewers in a fashion that was impossible to do before. Now, instead of becoming a reviewer by knowing the right people, its easier to be asked based on the status earned from the ideas shared among ones peers.<p>Spread the Word: We think we have something really important and special here. Of course, any startup would say that. We feel like were solving a legitimate real world problem. Maybe PG would say that we're avoiding Schlep Blindness. Academia is notorious for being slow to adopt disruptive technologies. CourseKit is dealing with something similar. Wed love for the HN community to spread the word if you guys and gals think that were doing something valuable.<p>Further Reading:\n Bjorn Brembs  Whats wrong with scholarly publishing today?

This is why money = voice.<p>In answer to your question: ""Should the MPAA be disallowed to make a political commercial and pay for its broadcast?"" They should be allowed to make a political statement by contributing to a superpac that runs the commercial, but the contribution should not be unlimited nor anonymous.

To my parents this was preferable to me hitching a ride with high school seniors in the computer club to go dumpster diving every weekend for 386s in the back of colleges, company headquarters, and landfills.  Though to be honest, it yielded quite a respectable stack of working computers.<p>I used the computer I built from my Wal-Mart money (Pentium 200MHz with 64MB of RAM) to learn how to program, enough about relational databases, and create dynamic websites (we're talking mid-90s here), so in my latter half of high school I was building basic e-commerce sites for larger local companies to save up tuition money to go to a state college and not have to take out loans.

It only implies that if you imagine the people can never be satisfied and should continuously seek higher pay/more power/etc... On the hedonic treadmill so to speak. I think people can be quite happy even if they aren't getting absolute top <insert motivating concept here>. For example, I am about 99% sure I could leave my present employer and find another job which would pay me more. Does that mean I should leave? It depends. Specifically on what I value. If my only concern (or topmost concern) is absolute top dollar then yes, I should leave. If my company wants to prevent that they can up my pay. If they know there is no way I can leave (i.e. they have agreed with the majority of large competitors to <i>not</i> hire me) then they have leverage that is simply unconscionable to me. Conversely if they do not believe I am worth my monetary demands then severing the relationship is the logical thing to do.<p>>Specific persons in your employ aren't fungible. They've accumulated training and product knowledge that you might direly need in order to meet a deadline or bring a product to market before a competitor, to cite the most obvious objection.<p>I never said they were fungible, I don't believe they are. This is part of employee power. If they were simply cogs in the machinery then employers would have all the power. Since they are not, employers must actually engage in a negotiation/agreement process with their employees and actually <i>gasp</i> try to ensure their continued happiness (note: this doesn't mean showering them with constant praise and telling them they are delicate little snowflakes and appeasing to their every demand no matter how ridiculous). They have to ensure that they are providing compelling value in a myriad of dimensions to retain said employees. They have to understand what motivates their employees on an individual level and strive to maximize the value they provide to said employee such that they exert a gravitational attraction making the employee not <i>want</i> to leave.<p>>In other words, the cost/benefit ratio of retaining a given employee is dominated by factors external to the labor market.<p>How so? This information the employee has only has value in as much as someone is willing to pay for it. If I have learned the esoterica of your operations and you decide that knowledge isn't worth whatever I am asking then that is a decision you freely made, you can't then cry that I am taking that knowledge elsewhere. If another employer decides that knowledge is worth what I ask then that is a decision that have made, both are made 'in the context of the labor market' and my value as an employee should be dictated by what said market will pay me vs. what I want, i.e. as a negotiation. If companies agree to simply not allow people to transfer there is no negotiation. Further the idea of stunting the intermingling of knowledge/ideas across company boundaries impedes the flow of knowledge/ideas and has an overall detrimental outcome for society as a whole. I am sure you have encountered people that have spent too long in a single place and are set in ways that make sense only in that one place. That is not healthy or good, we should not strive to institutionalize that.<p>>I'd also be interested to hear, in detail, how your particular arrangement of challenging work, bureaucracy, office politics, fair pay, and dignity and respect programs both reaches a maximum of employee satisfaction and functions in even one competitive company.<p>I think the idea that one can maximize along all these dimensions is a fallacy. If there was such a place that maximized all of this then everyone would want to work there and competitors would simply have to choose from the folks 'not good enough' to work at said fabled place. I don't believe human happiness is something that lends itself to some kind of Tayloristic maximization like the throughput of automated machinery. That said there are clearly places that are more desirable/better to work at than others, in any industry. The fact that I would rather work at say Google than Amazon says something about the environments and how well they have maximized what <i>I</i> view as important. The fact that someone else may, rationally, have the exact opposite view simply proves the startling fact that human beings are unique and can't be treated as a mass aggregate of indistinguishable things.<p>>And, which of bureaucracy or politics is going to be more generally erosive of ""basic dignity and respect,"" if you have to choose between them?<p>This can't be stated, in general, which is the problem with your whole argument as I see it. You seem to be under the impression that there is a maximization function that applies to all people across all situations and industries. I don't believe that to be true. The balance between bureaucracy and politics and how to best achieve said balance to maximize happiness of your current employees and attract the kind of candidates you want is precisely what management/HR roles are about. There is no silver bullet here, if you are looking for one you will generally be disappointed.<p>>Employers should just do only amazing things to me, or I'm within my rights to throw a fit and leave to go work for an obviously smarter employer<p>That is clearly a strawman and doesn't really relate in any way to my argument that people should in fact have the right to shop their talents around if they so desire, and that market should not be unduly stifled by back-room agreements between employers to not hire 'certain types'. Imagine the outrage (rightly so) if the agreement was that they won't higher minorities? The hiring decisions should be made on the grounds of what is best for the company making the offer, and that should be based on the skill-sets they need, the benefits they have to offer and the talent they can attract. As a shareholder it worries me that companies are possibly passing up on good employees that would bring value simply because they had some agreement with a competitor to 'not hire their employees'. I really see little difference between this and price collusion, which I think is clearly detrimental to a well functioning economy.<p>>but that doesn't mean you've actually got a workable hypothesis.<p>A number of companies (Google, Facebook, etc..) actually bill themselves as empowering their employees, lessening bureaucracy and hassle, paying competitive wages, giving you the opportunity to work on challenging problems, etc.. So I think there are existence proofs that these things are generally desirable and the only argument is 'how does one balance all of these things', and as I said I don't think there is a mathematical formula for doing that, which is unfortunate but also exciting as it is the same as saying there is not exactly one optimal solution for most interesting problems. There are generally competing ways with different tradeoffs that one must understand when trying to choose the one that is best in their particular situation. I don't believe the solution to the problem is to simply try to make it go away by 'trapping' your employees by agreeing with competitors that they shouldn't hire your employees and you will do the same to them. Calling this a gentleman's agreement is laughable.<p>[edit] Corrected some typos.",1327172984

I suspect there is a relationship between the commonality of the participants and the vibrancy of the community.<p>It has been my experience that when you take a set of self selected folks and give them a wide ranging area to discuss, their discussions about most topics are energetic and self-reenforcing. This makes for a very strong community experience.<p>I first noticed it hanging out with 'air force' kids (which is to say early in my life everyone I hung out with, their parents, like mine, were serving in the air force). That shared experience, moving from base to base, base housing which was always nearly the same, stores with the same goods, etc, we (the kids) seemed to have remarkably similar views about things. I noticed it again when I went to college, the bulk of the folks who entered engineering were all there for similar reasons and that created a community with a common set of interests and values. For many folks college was the first place they had experienced the 'community effect' that arises when there is a 'kind of people' selection criteria affecting the overall group.<p>I am glad for the successes of Reddit. Staying vibrant and alive will be a challenge, it is for any community, but they have a good start.",1327172858

Good content has been made online, and it's just getting started. I agree with the GP that simplifying and democratizing the funding would help, but so will new film makers realizing good is absolutely not synonymous with expensive (and is often contradictory).",1327172771

Main problem they have is that people with money most often don't get innovation and lack of confidence in ""tomorrow"" drives people to look for easiest ways to make a few $$$ now instead of creating sustainable and original business models.",1327172755
3494270,comment,3491542,3491542,1,0,justinlkarr,,,"I'm struck that there are great sites for learning how to code and how to build a small business around software development. Nothing like this exists for the entertainment industry. We have BFAs and MFAs that are roughly equivalent to your terminal degrees. But, as in software, many of our superstars and journeymen emerge from an entrepreneurial path instead of academia.<p>Most people who learn-by-doing in entertainment do so without a clearly structured path or often even identifiable short-term goals. They meet and impress people, get on a gigs doing (relatively) menial labor and learn as they go. As their career grows, they learn both craft and business: how do what they like and where, with whom and on what they should be doing it.<p>Sound familiar?<p>As with software, folks who hit the ground running on their own without much skill or business knowledge generally fail quite a bit before they succeed, even if they are in the top 1% on smarts and ambition.<p>Sound familiar?<p>Boards like this one, the various VC blogs and services like Code Academy, StackOverflow and umpteen Rails training sites all help software entrepreneurs focus their early efforts and move through the learning-to-do-it phase of their careers as quickly as possible.<p>Where is this for entertainment? We need a Code Academy for people who want to tell stories and get paid to do it.<p>Start with the basics: What is a story? How does it work? How is something funny or sad?<p>Move to the specific: Write a story to be read. Tell a story to your friends. Tell a story in a video.<p>Cover the business: Where to tell your stories. What different audiences expect. How much money do people expect to pay.<p>Get Detailed: Editing, lighting, acting, advanced wordplay, making-sure-every-single-thing-in-frame-is-perfect.<p>For the startup-makers:\nThe absurd proliferation of MFA programs in every discipline of entertainment suggests that there is a large market for a service that caters to people who want to learn to entertain people professionally.<p>And for the user-students:\n1. The emerging industry of professional YouTubers suggests that there is a viable marketplace for entrepreneurs with the skill to make small-scale entertainment people want see.\n2. The value that smart, well-trained MFAs bring to the ""big entertainment"" world suggests to those of us on the inside that some training is totally worth it. We would love to see a way for people to come to us a little less green and with a lot less debt.<p>From an insider's perspective, this would be hugely disruptive.<p>Disclosures: I work in commercial theater, not in film.

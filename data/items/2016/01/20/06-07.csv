Modern physics is not intuitive so it doesn&#x27;t matter how hard you try to imagine space-time or wave functions there is nothing to grab onto without the mathematics.

Maybe there is a better way to organize my python code, I do not know. Then I moved to Haskell (partly because of the excellent Parsec library which made things very simpler compared to the yacc style PLY I was using in Python). Initially, the fix-compile-execute cycle was really painful, but I soon realized how I could figure out some functional bugs (not type bugs) just by reasoning about the types.

It proved to be a vital part of Continuous Deployment.<p>Basically: Wrap every new feature in an Experiment Toggle.  Deploy to production (once ready for &#x27;non sandbox&#x27; testing).  Turn on for test users, test.  If good, start the rollout to experimental users. If after weeks the numbers worked out, turn it on for everyone...<p>...but if at any point unexpectedly bad things happened, just flip the feature toggle switch.

Here&#x27;s the quote:<p><i>even the greatest theoretical physicists of the twentieth century including Einstein, Fermi, Feynman and Bohr were really known for their physical intuition than for formidable mathematical prowess. Einstein&#x27;s strength was to imagine thought experiments, Fermi&#x27;s was to do rough back-of-the-envelope calculations. So while mathematics is definitely key to making advances in fields like particle physics, even in those fields what really matters is the ability to imagine physical phenomena and make sense of them. The history of physics presents very few examples – Paul Dirac’s work in quantum mechanics and Hermann Weyl&#x27;s work in group theory come to mind – where mathematical beauty and ability alone served to bring about important scientific progress.</i><p>There is nothing there that attempts to imply in any way at all that Einstein was bad at math. Infact, it matches your characterization of him (&quot;Einstein was indeed a very good mathematician&quot; ~= &quot;mathematics is definitely key to making advances in fields like particle physics&quot;) quite well.<p>I think what it is trying to say is that it is quite rare for a break through in Physics to require <i>new</i> maths. While we can all think of exceptions (and indeed the article mentions them) I think it&#x27;s a reasonable point to make.<p>I actually think this is a pretty good article, and attempts to make subtle points. Dismissing it like this by mischaracterizing what it is saying does it a dis-service IMHO.",1453269826

It's not a commodity, it's not, generally speaking, fungible so it takes a much more principled stand to force change. If you don't like, say, the way a certain bank or grocery store or gas company or what-have-you does business you can just switch to a competing product. Even if that requires compromises generally there will be alternatives which are suitable substitutes. But that's not the case with artistic works. There is only one The Beatles, only one Veronica Mars, only one Citizen Cane, and there's only one SimCity series. You can decide to avoid playing the new version, and you can decide to play some other game, but these are all wholly inadequate substitutes.<p>And this is how game makers and publishers have managed to get away not only with astoundingly bad DRM but also in releasing quite broken and incomplete games in some cases.

You have to think really hard about what goes into a cake and when, or else when someone tries to follow the recipe the cake will burn or will taste wrong.<p>But computers can't think, so you have to be really specific. If you need flour for your recipe, you have to tell it where to get the flour, how to open it up, and how to measure it. You need to tell it how to mix everything together and bake it so you can eat it in the end. But the best part is, even though coming up with a recipe for vanilla cake is really hard the first time, once you have that, it's easy to come up with chocolate cake, or a really big cake for a birthday party or cupcakes you can put in your lunchbox. So you have to learn a lot about cakes upfront, but then you can make all kinds of different cakes- cakes that say 'Happy Birthday' or 'Thank You' are pretty similar to make once you know about cakes in general.",1363298283

5377930,comment,5375929,5376652,4,0,dangrossman,,,"Your professor probably also mentioned that there must be intent to make a binding agreement. If these agreements are regularly made in this situation merely as an offer to negotiate an actual contract at a later time, then the parties do not intend to be bound and they are <i>not contracts</i>. I believe that to be the case.<p>From Anderson's Business Law:<p>> Because a contract is based on the consent of the parties and is a legally binding agreement, it follows that the parties <i>must have an intent to enter into an agreement that is binding</i>. Sometimes the parties <i>are in agreement, but their agreement does not produce a contract</i>. Sometimes there is merely a preliminary agreement, but the parties never actually make a contract, or there is merely an agreement as to future plans or intentions without any contractual obligation to carry out those plans or intentions.<p>> In some cases, <i>the fact that important terms are missing indicates that the parties are merely negotiating</i> and that a contract has not been made. When a letter leaves many significant details to be worked out later, the letter or printed matter is merely an invitation to negotiate. It is not an offer that may be accepted and a contract thereby formed.",1363298160

Instead of writing a python program that plays minesweeper, you write a minesweeper language where minefield, detonate, mine, digit, grid are keywords in some sense, where minesweeping can be explained in terms of your minesweeper language itself, not in terms of python & variables & functions & all that.<p>I will let the master explain -<p><a href=""http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/onlisp.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/onlisp.pdf</a><p>Read Section 1.2 - ""Change the language to suit the problem. In Lisp, you don’t just write your program down toward the language, you also build the language up toward your program. Language and program evolve together. Like the border between two warring states, the boundary between language and program is drawn and redrawn, until eventually it comes to rest along the mountains and rivers, the natural frontiers of your problem. In the end your program will look as if the language had been designed for it. And when language and program ﬁt one another well, you end up with code which is clear, small, and efﬁcient.<p>The greatest danger of Lisp is that it may spoil you. Once you’ve used Lisp for a while, you may become so sensitive to the ﬁt between language and application that you won’t be able to go back to another language without always feeling that it doesn’t give you quite the ﬂexibility you need."".",1363297904

He's just saying it's easier for most people to just eat 50g of carbs a day than jack up their protein intake.<p>e.g.,<p>>However, strictly speaking, any diet with less than 100 g/day of carbohydrate will cause ketosis to develop to some degree (more ketones will be generated as carbs are lowered).<p>[...]<p>>In any case, an intake of 15-50 grams per day of carbohydrate will still allow ketosis to develop and those ketogenic dieters attempting to ‘eat as few carbs as possible’ might want to consider that in the context of not only providing much needed food variety (at 50 g/day, even a small amount of fruit can often be fit in) but also in the context of the protein sparing issues I discussed above.\nGetting to the point, although the physiological requirement for dietary carbohydrates is zero, we might set a practical minimum (in terms of preventing excessive body protein loss) at 50 grams per day. I’d note again that, within the context of The Rapid Fat Loss Handbook approach, carbs are limited to essentially trace amounts; however protein (which makes up the majority of the diet) is set high enough to limit muscle loss.<p>[...]<p>>So, summing up mid-article, the absolute requirement for carbohydrates is zero grams per day. However, depending on protein intake, a practical minimum for carbs lies between 50 grams/day (if someone functions well in ketosis) to 100-120 grams per day (if they don’t function well in ketosis). Let me mention very specifically that I’m not suggesting those numbers are a recommended level, I’m simply using them to represent a practical minimum value.",1363297530

In the US, once you become a CLEC (basically a non-incumbent telco - Google isn't a CLEC but they buy from them) you can get blocks of phone numbers assigned to you and pay no recurring per-number costs.  In fact, you can even charge the <i>caller</i> a small interconnection fee and make a tiny amount of money per call (so tiny that the caller's telco generally eats the cost). This is how services like IPKall and Callcentric (both are CLECs) can offer free phone numbers, and why I suspect Google pays very little per phone number.  The equipment you need to be a CLEC is quite expensive though so consequentially IPKall and Callcentric only offer free numbers in a few area codes.",1363296691

If step 3 happens and the investor subsequently goes quiet--failing to deliver a ""yes"" or ""no""--then the investor has violated the community norms.

You assume it's a rather large set of people, but it might just be your aquaintances and some talking heads. I think any ill defined concepts in your moral understanding are like security holes, allowing for inconsistencys to slip in. And society somehow comes to mean a different thing in each case. It's a prime example of an inconsistent concept. Along with ""the public"", ""the greater good"", etc. You get my bend.<p>I think we're getting into value systems right now. Feeling better. Happiness, right? Exitement. Tranquility. Lack of Guilt. Joy. From AI i've learned that actors work optimally when they optimize a key metric. That metric has to be defined properly (So what makes this robot morose?), and there has to be a heuristic for estimating the changes to that metric given an action. I think we work very similarily. Your value system, whether you value joy, prestige or altruism is the optimization metric. Your emotional apparatus (it matches input to output) is the quick, over the thumb heuristic you use.<p>I for example am optimizing for Happiness. Creating things makes me happy. Solving tacky problems makes me happy. Helping other people makes me happy (If they choose to let me help them, and if they are thankful towards me afterwards). Learning useful things makes me happy.<p>It's quite likely that some of these things will benefit others greatly, but that's a side effect, not the moral justification of my actions.

Your app doesn't show me those words, so I have to hite space-bar and then wait some time before I know what key to strike next (probably worth mentioning that part of seeing the next word involves consuming the word, rather than individual characters -- so that standard letter-groups are queued up).<p>Edit: ...and now I can reply.

Choosing which messages to receive and respond to is defining an interface. If you don't want to do that, you just don't want an object-oriented list of strings. Maybe you just want a list of strings that lives in a struct with some function pointers and some syntactic sugar for calling those functions. And that's fine. But for those of us who <i>do</i> want an object-oriented list of strings, allowing that list of strings to respond to messages like ""where"" is perfectly acceptable, and certainly no worse than demanding that it only respond to messages like ""filter"".<p>If anything, it introduces unnecessary semantics to syntactically distinguish between messages that are responded to with instance variables and messages that are responded to with function calls.",1353895030

4830042,comment,4828431,4829725,2,0,cmccabe,,,"Not all is roses in the enterprise software world.<p>Businesses will often refuse to buy from companies they regard as likely to disappear in a few years-- unfortunately, most startups tend to get lumped into this category by default.  The burden of proof is on you to prove otherwise.  (This is rational behavior on their part, by the way.)  Managers are naturally conservative.  They know that signing a slightly too-expensive deal with, say Oracle (to pick a random example), won't get them fired-- but signing a deal with some startup that fails to deliver surely will end their career.<p>Finally, there's the problem that because sunk costs in existing systems are often high, it can be hard to break into a market.  This is what keeps COBOL and even FORTRAN chugging away in corners of the world.  Costs might be lower a few years after replacing these systems-- but then again, they might not.  It depends on who you get to put in the replacement, and if you have trouble telling the good developers from the bad, maybe you are better off not touching it.  Building and deploying is one thing.  Selling is quite another, and it's not easy or cheap.  Forget about word-of-mouth and friends-of-friends.<p>Do enterprises demand a higher standard of testing?  I think it depends on what your product does.  I work in enterprise storage, so for us there absolutely is a higher standard of testing.  I can't speak for other applications, though.<p><i>Things like Yammer and Salesforce are practically the exception that proves the rule; the very rare app that needs to scale multitenant across every company in the world.</i><p>Yeah, but that's where the fun is for engineers.

Because attacker is attacking a mass of passwords, he is likely to use a parallel computer, such as a GPU or an ASIC, to decrease the cost of he attack.<p>The defense against this scenario is to make hashes expensive to compute and hard to parallelise. If an algorithm is using a lot of RAM it's hard to parallelise because a piece of RAM can be used by only one computation  at a time, hence this algorithm is hard to attack, but your own server is computing things sequentially as users come online, so a single piece of RAM can be freely reused. This is why low RAM usage is bad.<p>I did not quite get the idea behind the ROM thing, but I think it means you have a large multi-GB piece of strongly random data, which is used during hash computation either entirely, or piecemeal where pieces are picked pseudorandomly and not predictably. A GPU cannot store multi-GB chunk of data, so it will have to travel externally to fetch required data, which is easy to do for a sequential machine, but creates a huge bottleneck for a GPU, making parallelism hard again.",1353891974

That a few hundred million people are at least shallowly engaging with people they haven't seen in years is pretty remarkable. But where I disagree with Time is that I don't think Zuckerberg was a particularly necessary ingredient. Facebook hit the scene as basically a cleaner, better designed MySpace.

There is currently no website that let’s entertainment professionals network and connect in an environment designed for that purpose. Of course the entertainment profession is desperately in need of such a site because of the project based nature of that industry and the need to always meet new people.

The worst part was the sound; despite shooting a lot, it was the first time I'd ever been next to a firearm fired inside a 3m x 2m x 3m concrete room without wearing hearing protection.  I also had a sore throat from yelling at the guy for the next ~15 minutes.

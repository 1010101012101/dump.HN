It worked well because they set up an environment for me, the data model was fixed, and there was a list of short requirements I could complete in order, so I was able to just dive into the work, and spend time on the kind of things that were relevant.<p>Another one basically asked me to take a large dataset, build a web application around it, and deploy it, which would probably have taken me a week to complete but &quot;should&quot; have taken around 3 hours. They tried to present it a really interesting problem I would enjoy working on and then asked me to keep all my work confidential.<p>Most of the tests I&#x27;ve done are still closer to general problem solving/comp sci tests, which is still pretty far removed from the actual work, but at least they&#x27;re not a huge time sink when implemented properly.",1425727732

For a growing company with several work streams and projects hungry for talent, the interview approach you posit would never work.<p>Another thing that came to mind is the fact that educators and cognitive scientists have been working for decades in what constitutes a good and effective test.

In many languages that allow compile-time metaprogramming, like C++ and D, IO cannot be performed at compile time, so such schema-driven code generation would not be possible.<p>Actually this would be possible in D since you can read files at compile-time with the &quot;import(filename)&quot; syntax. Then you can use compile-time parser generators to parse it.",1425726393

I once had a site, but didn&#x27;t renew registration, and guess what? It&#x27;s been &quot;successfully parked&quot; by somebody who saw &quot;ludicrous opportunities&quot; to raise a few cents/yr. Sometimes I thought to restore the site, which was very informative, but I couldn&#x27;t, because it&#x27;s deeply linked to the domain it was on, and that somebody wants a ridiculous sum to hand me back domain ownership; I would have been happy if only he had used the domain to provide some value instead of click bait.<p>Lesson learned: never give up a domain, because it won&#x27;t ever be free again. Instead, put it on sale.",1425726312

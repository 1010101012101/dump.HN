Some say that it doesn't work, but after customizing the settings, I find extends my battery pretty well.<p>- Douban.fm. Good online radio app for those of us outside US without access to Pandora et al. Chinese startup so speeds can be slower at times.<p>- For my todo list, I use Flick Note as a widget extended to cover an entire homescreen (with TouchWiz 4.5), synced to Simple Note. I also use Flick Note for all other note-taking needs, and have frozen/disabled a few default apps with similar features.

I'm tired of the number of S and F-bomb dropping, rockstar programmer mentality-wielding morons who clog up the innovation space, and have nothing to contribute but FUD and nay-saying.<p>We're developers. We create. We find itches and scratch them. Node.JS is the result of Dahl scratching his itch, and a lot of us see merit in the project. Some very smart people (I'm tipping my cap to the people at Joyent, here) are actively addressing Node's rougher edges, so we'll see constant improvement. It's still relatively young (especially compared to the holy UNIX), and so what if it doesn't solve all of your problems; there's room for everyone to play in the web server scene, even JavaScript.",1317551442

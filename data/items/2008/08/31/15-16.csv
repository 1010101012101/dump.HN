I'm also looking forward to booking a hotel in the moon colony in a couple of years.<p>It's not that it is impossible. We could have flying cars and moon tourists any time we want, but the cost is much greater than the benefits.",1220198034

291395,comment,291363,291363,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"of course. Start with a piece of paper and do a high level plan of the main goals/sections of the site. I find it helpful to use persona/role-driven design here. Once i have the main goals, then I develop the home page for a role inside Photoshop. I then develop an inner page. Once i have that, I move on to [web language of choice (i.e. php/asp.net)] and develop a few templates. Then I develop the home page and the inner pages using pure html (no database). Once I'm happy there, I move on to DB stuff nad oo-level stuff to support it.<p>I did all of <a href=""http://www.learnsqlserver.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.learnsqlserver.com/</a>,  <a href=""http://www.learnitfirst.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.learnitfirst.com/</a> and <a href=""http://www.videobooks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.videobooks.com/</a> sites by myself. It took a while but so what? I'm proud of the fact that I did it and I learned so much along the way.",1220197123

I lived there for a few years while my wife was getting her PhD at UK. There is a LOT of money knocking around the area, mostly around horses, but it filters down into the entire feel of the city. UK also has a pretty vibrant tech community. Obviously it is no Boston or Palo Alto, but I'd move back there in a heart-beat.",1220196489

It just has a reputation as being used mostly for the web because Rails is its most popular app.<p>I don't really use Ruby (I already know Python well, and while I've played with Ruby a bit, I think my studying time is better spent on languages that are more different), so I'm going to let Ruby-ists provide examples if they want.",1220195764

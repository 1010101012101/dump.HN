That company has been so mismanaged for so long I couldn't possibly fathom what it takes to get fired from there. They went from being on top of the world to being practically radioactive. I know their downward spiral started long before this guy came in, but there certainly wasn't any improvement under his leadership.

264385,comment,264282,264282,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"I'm looking for the same answer, but I'll share what I found out so far (the hard way). There are two ways to pay a salesperson. First is by comission, where you pay according to the amount sold. This is best, but it will be hard to find somebody on this terms if you're a young startup. Second is where you negociate a salary, and you set a target. The target need not be about sales, it can be about appointments set (very useful), calls made, emails sent or any other metric.<p>Now, the don't-be-stupid part: never _ever_ hire somebody in sales with fixed salary without targets. Where there is a salary, there must be targets. You can of course offer both comission and a salary, but the salary must be dependent on some other metric then the comission.<p>Also a good part of the sales process is finding the best metrics. It should be something like: for 100 phones you get 5 appointments, from which you get 2 second appointments and 0.7 contracts. Each of those steps can and should be optimized separately, once you have the process established.",1217620348

The day after it launched: ""Well, this is interesting, but I can't ever see myself using it.""  3 months later, after I started using it: ""Well, I use it, but I can't ever see it getting popular.""  Early 2006, in response to PG's comment about ""This sucker's profitable"": ""But are they profitable enough to cover the opportunity cost's of the founder's salaries?""  Mid 2006: ""Okay, they're profitable through bizdev deals, but I can't imagine them ever getting bought.""  I believe they were acquired on Halloween 2006.<p>2.) Infogami: I thought they were the most likely of the SFP05 startups to be successful, right until they launched.<p>3.) Wufoo, when it came out: ""I don't get what the point is.""  About 9 months later: ""Incidentally, I'd put Wufoo, VirtualMin, and DropBox at the bottom of the deadpool, i.e. most likely to succeed.""<p>4.)

RescueTime: Loved it from the moment I heard about it.  Immediately recommended it to friends; if I had money, I'd invest.<p>7.) Thinkature: I thought this was really cool when it came out, and that it'd be one of the survivors of its batch.<p>8.)

264375,comment,264203,264269,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It may not be a smoking gun, but there is definitely smoke around phytoestrogens in soy products.  There have been a few human studies in Japan that indicate reduced testosterone in men, and other effects in women.  Though some studies have also indicated positive impact...reduced cancer risk and hints of greater longevity being the most impressive.<p>Perhaps alleviating some of the alarm, many soy products have drastically reduced levels of these compounds (tofu) or practically none at all (tempeh, real fermented soy sauce), and in these cases the benefits of soy (high quality protein, no cholesterol, low fat, etc.) almost certainly outweigh the negatives, compared to almost any other source of protein (meat, for example, becomes quite carcinogenic when grilled or cooked in pretty much any way that produces browning or blackening in the meat, in addition to containing cholesterol, no fiber, and lots of ""bad fats"").<p>So, while I'm not cutting tofu and tempeh and good soy sauce out of my diet, or even reducing it (I'm a vegetarian, and it's a staple of my diet), I avoid any form of raw soy: soy flour, edamame, soy milk, etc.<p>Also worth noting, soy in the forms that Americans most often consume it is a new phenomenon.  Soy was considered inedible until the past 20-25 years, and it's only through extremely heavy marketing and lobbying pressure that soy has become part of every Americans diet (whether they know it or not, in cereals, in breads, in oils, and dozens of other places you would never think to look).  In the cultures where soy has been consumed for hundreds or thousands of years, it has been in processed forms: tofu, tempeh, and soy sauce.  Though young salted soy beans (called edamame in the west) are a popular snack in Japan and a few other places.  Anyway, I'm suspicious of any food that has been foisted on me by huge corporations...and soy popularity in America is very much the result of a major corporate push.  Corn is another fine example of money making for dangerous agricultural policy, leading to serious nutritional problems for a large segment of the population.",1217619858

A couple of my blog posts have been posted recently - none got much real traffic but i'm now getting +75 hits from expired YC URLs daily.<p>example:\nhttp://news.ycombinator.com/x?fnid=bu1a8HSpa3\nhttp://news.ycombinator.com/x?fnid=w0rxaX4D1c<p>am i missing something? is there some link sharing thing that could be sending these hits legitimately?  otherwise i'm guessing something weird is going on.  i would have searched for this to see if it had already been commented - hopefully not a rerun..",1217617810

I can't support myself for more than a few months before being forced to work again.<p>So, if I want to do a startup, I need an angel investor to fund me.  That brings me to the second problem, I'm tied down into middle america.  I love the city I'm in, but it doesn't have the kind of abundance of cash that the coasts have.<p>So, my plan moving forward is to contribute to open source and personal projects.  I'll try to make a few bucks off them, but probably nothing serious.  If I hit on an idea that I am really passionate about, I'll work on it more exclusively on the side or whatever day job I have, until it is able to provide decent income by itself.<p>As far as your ideas question, I have no shortage of ideas, but I have a shortage of ideas that would be good businesses.  They are either too small, too hard to monetize, or they are simply that I don't have the passion for them to take them far enough to make them viable.",1217617793

I don't know the details of current industrial processes, but you can easily free hydrogen by displacing it with something that binds more tightly (eg, Sodium: 2H2O + 2Na => H2 + 2NaOH) and produce free hydrogen gas with sodium hydroxide waste. I suspect that a similar sort of process is happening currently when water is hydrolyzed with a ""catalyst"" in current processes.<p>Platinum is often used in catalysts. It works by providing an alternative reaction pathway that takes less energy to fuel the reaction. An analogy is that instead of rolling a rock up a hill to get it from point A to point B, the catalyst provides access to a tunnel through the hill.",1217617741

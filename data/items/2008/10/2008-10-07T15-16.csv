2) Who's going to pay for it?<p>It sounds like one of those things that a small number of people talk passionately about but there's not actually any money in making their pain go away. Or maybe -- beats the heck out of me where the payback is.<p>Client-side this is less than a week on the Microsoft platform -- a month if you want to handle all email clients. Server-side? I think you'd have to pick just one mail host and stick to customizing it.<p>One of the issues would be turning it off -- you'd have to have some kind of neato keypad test thingy to prevent drunken farts from just clicking the button and sending anyway. That leads me to believe a better design might be client-side.",1223394780

325762,comment,325572,325744,0,0,sapphirecat,,,"> Besides Sun really has a cross platform ecosystem with 1st party support of Linux<p>You may think so now, but for a long time, Sun didn't allow distributors to include Java in their repositories. If you wanted Java, you had to go download it yourself. And all your users did, too, whether from Sun or from the JRE you bundled with your app. In other words, if you chose Java, you also chose bloat and a tiny userbase. Not to mention, Java is a second-class citizen on the Mac. You never know what's going to happen between Apple and Sun.<p>Another obvious candidate, Python, was already on everyone's machines. But to be cross-platform, you have to code carefully and ask your users to find/install GTK2 and dependencies on Windows. With Python, the bloat (from a user's POV) is only confined to Windows.<p>Perl is widely available, but not really cross-platform. They're still struggling with Neopolitan Perl to support Windows without relying on the goodness of ActiveState.<p>So Java becoming useful has been about 5-8 years too late, and it's still beholden to Apple on one platform. Other alternatives also suck, so the FOSS world has continued using C/C++. Without a clear winner, what's the point of switching languages?<p>And as far as cross-platform goes, even if something was perfectly cross-platform, I wonder if FOSS developers would support it. Projects like Inkscape are torn between the increased userbase from Windows, and the increased tech support for windows that those users would require, when the developers often don't have Windows machines to develop and test on.",1223393703

What I found was:<p>1) the core mono libraries are extremely good, I was able to drop the binaries on Linux and get to work immediately
2) projects on top of the core libraries and requiring integrating with other services (web servers like Apache, nginx) can turn out a nightmare. While I managed to setup everything on Cent OS and Ubuntu, nothing was really working as it should<p>So, personally I'm a big fan of mono and already looking for trying some winforms stuff there, but ... mono needs more resources I guess to get polished",1223393309

The app I work on, though very js-intensive, is nevertheless performance-bound by these other constraints and has actually gotten <i>slower</i> under some recent browser releases (Firefox 3). Not just a little slower, either: slower enough to become borderline-unusable. That's ironic when everybody is slapping each other on the back about their enormous performance advancements. ""Of course it's faster. Look at these benchmarks!"" It reminds me of my old professor's anecdote. She was visiting her sister and said ""Oh, I'm cold."" The sister went to look at the thermostat and said, ""No you're not, it's 20Ëš in here!"" (70ËšF)<p>That being said, WebKit kicks Gecko's ass right now (at least for this particular app). It renders and scrolls many times faster and in fact is just shockingly good in Safari 3 (not quite as great in Chrome).<p>Edit: This comment sounds a bit grumpier than I intended.

325738,comment,325639,325639,0,0,makecheck,,,"Developers are motivated by interesting work, and like to have chances to grow their skill set.  Also, most developers I know hate rules: give them credit for knowing how to code, don't bog them down with arbitrary things like a 500 page policy manual.  Finally, you hired your developers to write code, so make sure you aren't wasting their time on non-development tasks.<p>One way to keep work interesting is to give every developer at least two projects.  This allows a person to switch between them if one becomes boring or frustrating for a few hours.  You could even encourage small pet projects that developers are very enthusiastic about, even if the projects are not completely work-related.<p>You should invest in a bookshelf of manuals, and make a ""cheat sheet"" of places to look online for help in your technologies (PHP and .NET).  Make sure everyone knows a few of your in-house experts.  Developers should not have to look far to improve.<p>Give developers a lot of leeway.  Avoid large policy manuals and rulebooks, instead occasionally remind them of simple guidelines like ""follow the style of the rest of the code in the file"", and ""create libraries to handle the really mundane stuff"".  Be <i>very</i> open to new ideas, even if this means a new language (I have seen projects spiral to their doom because the actual goal was incredibly awkward to implement in the ""preferred"" languages of the developers).<p>And finally, as I said, keep developers developing.  Don't waste their time forcing them to (for instance) manually enter information into some form, such as a spreadsheet, or manually produce something like a set of progress slides for management.  Focus on the <i>information</i> you want from them, and have your managers simply ask for that information in voice or plain text.  Your managers should be producing the pretty forms.",1223392179

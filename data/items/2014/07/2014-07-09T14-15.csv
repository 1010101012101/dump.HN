Only here you also give a job and funding to do it appropriately to the cyclist and say to the judoka to go f* himself until he participates in more Tour de France.<p>Of course, the thing is that you can&#x27;t even have good criteria, because necessarily if you give criteria they become the goal, and instead of doing good research and publishing what is necessary when and where it makes sense, academics are forced to do research and have a publication policy that satisfy the arbitrary criteria. And even if the unlikely case where the criteria match what&#x27;s better, it is impossible for it to be the case in the so many different fields of research.<p>The only good solution would be to judge academics by the two or three most relevant publications they have on the matter of the grant or job. That would require reading the publications, and if possible the report of the peer-review process (which would be enabled by <i>open peer review</i>).",1404917919

Now she has very little issue walking into a store or restaurant and ordering something that won&#x27;t give her severe pain and require some vicodin for a bit. She&#x27;s said that she is happy that gluten-free diets became a fad and would rather be lumped into this group of fad dieters, than have hard time surviving on the smaller selection of things that were available for her to eat previously. The only difference now is that she really has to make sure that the people taking her food orders at restaurants really know she is severely allergic (clean cooking surface, check the dressings/glazes/etc... to make sure they are GF, etc...). All in all, a fair trade off for those that didn&#x27;t choose this diet.",1404917858

8009930,comment,8008974,8008974,24,0,joeblau,,,"As a developer, layout and screen size is not the main problem with Android.  To be honest, Android isn&#x27;t even the problem.  It&#x27;s hardware that Android is built on that is the problem.  If a handset is broken down into all of it&#x27;s sensors [Speaker, Camera, Light Sensor, Microphone, Compass, Accelerometer, Clock, NFC, GPS, Screen, BLE, Wifi, Altimeter, Speedometer, CPU] that&#x27;s where the fragmentation problem is.  It&#x27;s hard to say which devices contain certain sensors (CPU, Screen, Camera, Mic, and Speakers are pretty standard).  Of the devices that have most of those sensors, it&#x27;s hard to say say which devices have those sensors working correctly.<p>I attended a Facebook/Parse hackathon where FB detailed issues about a certain bug in specific CPU&#x27;s with respect to a C++ based photo processing library.  Certain Android phones would randomly crash.  There is also the infamous compass video [1] where multiple devices all with different hardware report different readings.  As a developer, the Android Emulator makes me think I&#x27;m going to have a consistent user experience, but based on hardware, I may not.<p>In my personal experience, I built this game (<a href=""http://joeblau.com/orb./"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joeblau.com/orb./</a>) which runs on iOS and Android and I noticed a crazy bug where it would only crash on S4&#x27;s from Sprint, not from Verizon or AT&T.  I re-worked some code to get the application working eventually, but the fact that something would only break on a specific carrier&#x27;s version of the hardware was crazy to me. The problem is not Android; Android as an OS is actually very good. The problem is HTC, Samsung, Motorola and all of the other hardware manufacturers that build the handsets.  Thankfully Google is doing what it can to address the hardware issue by announcing their Android One program, but that hurts other hardware competitors.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://vine.co/v/MgWLMmmwUQQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vine.co/v/MgWLMmmwUQQ</a>",1404917808

Take a look at the documentation for screen support (<a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support...</a>).<p>They split phone sizes (2-10&quot;) into four generalized sizes (small, normal, large, xlarge). Then they split screen density into generalized densities (ldpi, mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi) based on 3:4:6:8 ratios. The example on the page lists 5 different layout XML files (the 4 previously mentioned + extra large landscape orientation) for different sizes, and three folders for image assets in different densities.<p>But, there are tablet layouts for Android 3.2+, which use a completely different system based on size qualifiers where you can provide minimum/maximum pixel sizes for layouts.<p>The logic for iOS seems super simple in comparison.<p>With a few Android projects under your belt, you have probably internalized how everything works, and which parts are fringe cases you can ignore.

MIT switched from Scheme to Python because a large segment of students in 6.001 were not necessarily going into computer science...</i>&quot;<p>Nope, MIT has an introductory computing course that logically goes before 6.001-4 or the new 6.01-2.  For a long while they didn&#x27;t have one due to resource constraints, they dropped this service course about the time 6.001-4 was developed, but other departments had their own more domain specific introductory courses (see below for more details).<p>6.001 was canned and Scheme completely purged from the undergraduate curriculum for political reasons, after the Department, and likely School of Engineering and the Institute itself panicked when the dot.com bust more than halved enrollment, after it had been 40% of the undergraduate class for decades.  Oh, yeah, after the Institute had also blown a quarter billion dollars in a not very functional new building for the EECS research labs.<p>&quot;<i>... and were there as because of a common core curriculum.</i>&quot;<p>That ignores that MIT&#x27;s EECS department has for a <i>very</i> long time insisted that EE majors have serious programming experience, and CS majors the same for hardware.  6.001 programming, 6.002-3 hardware, 6.004 both, all majors had to take all 4.  This was  true but less coherent in the &#x27;70s before that common core was developed, and it&#x27;s still true with 6.01-2 which combine both.  MIT&#x27;s EECS department started as an EE department, this is not an unusual approach for such, vs. ones that started from the math side or otherwise independent of EE.  If you want pure CS, you shouldn&#x27;t go to MIT or U.C. Berkeley, but to CMU or Standford (or so I gather about the latter three).<p>&quot;<i>Does it really make sense to teach such people to write language interpreters in an introductory course?</i>&quot;<p>Yes, if you want them to really understand what it&#x27;s all about.  Since it&#x27;s Lisp, that&#x27;s also much less intense than it normally is, essentially all the colossal parsing messes with other language families can be skipped thanks to its S-expression syntax, and you can focus on the very basics.<p>As for e.g. Civil Engineers, MIT&#x27;s Civil and Environmental Engineering department has its own  1.000 and 1.001 courses for its type of computing, and as I remember that was true way back when 6.001-4 was developed.  In the late &#x27;70s 4 or so engineering departments got together and got VAX11/780, which they used for their own education etc. purposes, while EECS later procured first a DECSYSTEM-2060 (which had a CPU twice as fast, but a max of 1 MiB address space), then/in addition HP 68000 workstations (eventually Project Athena took over this sort of duty, I think).<p>Finally, whatever the pedagogical merits of Scheme and/or SICP/6.001, Python is now winning due to fashion rather than merit (although it does have some merits compared to other languages that could and are often used like Java).",1404917146

Money is not a function of time, therefore it does not make sense to describe it with time-dependent terms such as “linear” or &quot;constant”. Inflation, the change in the purchasing power of money over time, yes. Money, no.<p>Money is simply a token that we use to represent the intangible concept of value. I think your comment seeks to address a change in what individuals, and by extension and on aggregate, societies, fundamentally value over time.<p>I’ll return to that in a bit. First let me address the problem with your example: It ignores the compounding returns to performing similar actions over <i>time</i>.  Economically: Human capital accumulation. Colloquially: Experience.<p>When you get your first entry-level salaried job, you are actually a liability to the company. You come in with a low level of human capital - the company is basically paying to train you, all the while putting up with any potential mistakes due to your lack of experience. Why would a company do this?<p>By hiring you, the company is making an investment in your stock of human capital. It takes on some risk up front in return for some amount of reward in the future when you are wiser. As you gain experience over time, (ideally) you perform increasingly valuable tasks with a higher efficiency. You have accumulated the one thing youth (or old age for that matter) cannot buy for itself: time.<p>Getting paid for 3 hours for &quot;little to no work&quot; is a drop in the bucket compared to 10 years of solid, salaried employment.<p>By comparison, one-off jobs which might net you $20 in a couple of hours are a completely different situation where a low level of human capital is not purchased by means of a salaried contract. Rather, it is rented with a much shorter time horizon in mind, generally for menial tasks that require little to no experience.<p>To connect this idea back to the larger debate of “lowering the value of work”: I think you need to specify what kind of work you are talking about. I agree that the value of human menial labor is constantly decreasing. Why?<p>The supply of physical, menial tasks (washing dishes or mopping floors) is determined by the inflows of the human birthrate (more humans=more eating=more dishes to wash) and the outflows of automation (dishwashing machines), among other factors. Automation adds value by adding hours to our lives that would otherwise be spent washing dishes. For menial tasks it is generally more cost efficient. Thus the outflow outweighs the inflow (decreasing birthrate) leading to a lower supply of menial labor.<p>I don’t think we will revert to a hunter-gatherer bartering society in the future. Markets and specialization are much more efficient forms of raising standards of living, which I define as the ultimate goal of “human progress”. I think we will eventually need to reexamine our definition of “standards of living” as we move away from the realm of the physical to that of the virtual. Perhaps one (sad) day food will be unnecessary, as we redesign our bodies to subsist on a different form of energy, or do away with physical bodies altogether. This standard of living does not take into account food, shelter, transportation, etc. – the fundamentals that we strive to improve today through progress.<p>Anyways, enough with the science fiction and philosophizing. The fundamental lesson here is that the market gets what the market wants. There are a lot of human beings, so menial labor, both physical and mental, is in high supply driving down its relative value/price. Technology is eating jobs from the bottom up. Increase your human capital so that your brain is more valuable than a charged hunk of steel. Be the person who knows how to operate the machine and you will never have to beg for a $20 bus ticket.",1404915810

8009710,comment,8009079,8009399,6,0,JPKab,,,"You are exactly right.<p>These huge military projects (which for the most part are utterly unnecessary) are nothing more than jobs programs cloaked as national security.  There is certainly a huge element of rent extraction by defense contractor executives, as well as small business owners who utilize specialized direct award &quot;set asides&quot; designed for minorities, women, service disabled veterans (the vast majority of these are people who were never in combat, and have minor injuries at best such as back-pain), etc.  Of course, the large defense contractors simply sub-contract to these small businesses and then do all the work, while the 3 people who constitute the small business pocket money for doing nothing other than existing.<p>But beyond the rent-extraction, you have a nation with a hugely oversized, overstaffed military.  We take people, the vast majority of whom have an average high school record and zero college experience, and then put them into an immensely bloated, 1950&#x27;s era organization.  A small percentage of them will learn how to perform combat operations.  The majority of them will learn to perform the logistics functions (supply, maintenance, repair, administration) that are the backbone of any military.<p>While some of these skills learned (electronics, software, etc) are in demand in the private sector, the vast, vast majority are not.  In fact, a huge percentage of the administrative functions in the military have long been automated in the private sector.  It is a truly overstaffed, bloated beyond belief organization.<p>So where do you go when you get out of active duty?  If you are like many folks, you are truly fed up with being in a large government institution, and you want nothing more to do with the military.  You go to school, aggressively learn some trade/skill that is in demand in the private sector, and you leave it.<p>The majority of people I&#x27;ve encountered don&#x27;t do this.  Instead, they take the only jobs they are qualified for:  &quot;quals&quot; (somebody with military experience in some obscure area of logistics for an organization that is required on paper for a contractor to have employed upon award of a contract) for a defense contractor, or a civil service civilian job in the Department of Defense or other segments of the Federal gov&#x27;t.<p>Both are, to some degree, do nothing jobs.  A &quot;Qual&quot; might provide lots of advice to a defense contractor they are employed by, but typically they are just there because the contract demands that they are.  They are mostly figure-heads.  The joke in the industry is that many are hired and hang out in darkened offices playing video games, separated from the software developers and managers who were never in the military.<p>The civil service jobs in the Federal gov&#x27;t are like working in any large bureaucracy.  Mediocrity isn&#x27;t just tolerated, but is the norm.  People come in at 9 and leave at 3.  If you care about your job, you work hard and end up carrying the weight of several of your coworkers who do nothing but watch the clock.  Promotions are based on paper qualifications and certifications, are decided by people who have never met you, and are frequently awarded to people who dedicated their time to gaming the paper system instead of performing their job function.<p>What I am saying sounds anecdotal, but organizational experts who have studied failures at places such as the V.A. have all summed these findings up in a scientific way.<p>In Arlington, VA, there is a neighborhood called Crystal City.  In Crystal City, there is a large, brand-new environmentally sustainable building which houses a huge number of EPA employees.  The EPA has a valuable, important mission.  For someone like me, it is beyond depressing seeing the employees milling about on 2 hour lunch breaks.  The vast majority of them drive to work, despite the building being walking distance from a subway station.  There is a mass exodus at 3PM as they all leave for suburbia.<p>Just like the rest of the Federal gov&#x27;t, the EPA and the DOD are nothing more than giant employment programs.  The difference is that the EPA gets its budget hammered by one political party that hates it, while the DOD is universally praised and worshipped by people who don&#x27;t understand that the percentage of members who will ever see combat is in the single digits.",1404915457

But I wouldn&#x27;t describe them as functional programming languages, but rather -concurrent- ones. They -will- change how you think about concurrency, distribution, and fault tolerance if you&#x27;re coming from a more typical OO paradigm.<p>Let it crash, and all the mechanisms and decisions made to ensure that that is a viable strategy, the per process encapsulation of state, the message passing paradigm, the extremely cheap concurrency, and yes, the functional aspect of it, have changed my coding patterns in pretty fundamental ways.<p>To give a real world implication, I had a situation where an unknown number of scheduled tasks had to fire, each one involving multiple steps, with each step being itself a scheduled event (and those times could change). Some could start at the same time. Each one entailed a non-trivial amount of work, IO bound.<p>The traditional approach would be to create a thread pool of the maximal number of simultaneous things I wanted to support, create a heap or similar of all scheduled tasks, peek at the top of the heap, sleep until that amount of time, then put that task onto the threadpool. Repeat. Any changes though...the heap would have to be rebuilt. Or whatever. A whole lot of bookkeeping, basically, and a data structure that does not map to what I&#x27;m doing, and which requires locking, and possible race conditions and bottlenecking.<p>In Erlang (and Elixir)? A new process per scheduled event, with a paired timer process to send it a message when it&#x27;s supposed to start up. Each process is responsible for its own timer; updates to a process cause it to modify its timer, and if a task involves multiple time separated steps, it just creates a new timer when it finishes one, to wake it when it&#x27;s supposed to do the next. There is no interaction between scheduled items, so why should I have to code around dealing with all of them simultaneously? No locks, no race conditions, no bottlenecking. Bugs are pretty much guaranteed to be in the task code itself, rather than in the task scheduling code, and are much easier to track down and solve.",1404914979

I do, however, see a lot of potential to accelerate or reduce the cost of development for certain types of projects.<p>Would you mind sharing your experiences with projects that went well or not so well? Is there ever a good reason to outsource development, even if you have in-house developers?<p>How do you make sure the development team is any good? Or, how do you find a good team?<p>Is there any forum (in real life or online) where people who outsource development and development teams congregate and discuss best practices/challenges?",1404914693

When you hear about starving children in some far away place, you empathize, not because you know the suffering children, but because we&#x27;re hard wired to protect our young. Other times, we empathize because we can identify with another person&#x27;s experience.<p>HttpWatch is a tool for developers, made by developers. Their hope with this message is that other developers will identify with their challenges. Every developer who sells their software in the app store has struggled with the pricing question. The addition of empirical evidence to support their pricing was a nice touch.<p>There&#x27;s always a skeptical subset of people who will not respond to any appeal. In my experience, that group is overrepresented here on HN, so I&#x27;m not surprised at the responses, but my hunch is that this message will have some positive effect for HttpWatch.",1404914618

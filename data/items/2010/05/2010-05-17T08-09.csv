That's true of most submissions, but doesn't seem to be true of polls.<p><pre><code>  > Nobody is going to withhold the votes in order to not give you the karma.

I think there will be people who vote and move on without thinking to upvote it.  Because of that, I wanted to remind people to up-vote the submission.<p>However, there are people who resent being asked for up-votes, and I wanted to make sure they weren't annoyed by that.  I don't want to annoy people gratuitously, and this is the technique I have.  People who don't care about karma, whatever, won't care (mostly).  People who do care about karma, whatever, have a means of punishing me for asking.<p><pre><code>  > Polls usually don't get a lot of upvotes unless the poll subject is really good.
</code></pre>
Exactly, that's why I wanted to ask for upmods - to buck that trend.<p>So here's a summary of my reasoning:<p>* Some people vote and move on without upmodding<p>* I want them to upmod so the item has a chance to get enough votes to be vaguely meaningful<p>* That means I need to ask for upmods<p>* Some people resent that, so I need some way they can punish me<p>* The ""scapegoat comment"" seems to satisfy that.",1274084736

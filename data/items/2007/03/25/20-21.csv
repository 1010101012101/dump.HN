Especially apis that embed their brand (and potentially ads) in other peoples pages. There are a lot reasons for api providers not to pull nonsense like this. Amazon clearly does not look very good here. <p>But ultimately, yeah, there's always some risk when you run off an api you don't control.",1174854757

The API provider can block you at any time.  Here are other examples:  \n - In May 2006, Ebay blocked Rapleaf's attempt at making seller reputations portable. Rapleaf was using Ebay's API.\n - In 1999, UPS and FedEx blocked all companies that were using their APIs to display and transact best shipping methods. All of those startups were using UPS and FedEx API. This happened again in Jan 2006, when UPS blocked www.simpletracking.com and once again in late 2006, when UPS and FedEx blocked startup www.RedRoller.com Their website is still up, but without UPS and FedEx in there, it's evident that they are dying. Once again, RedRoller was using FedEx and UPS API. \n - Startups using Google API are subject to the same issue..Google will block you as soon as you come in their radar screen.\n...so if you are planning to use APIs, figure out your plan B in advance!",1174853561

I'm perhaps a bit unrepresentative since my normal job is also at a (later-stage, profitable) startup, but I found my day job is far more stressful than the startup.<p>When you work for someone else, there are a large number of factors that you cannot control.  You can't pick your technologies: you generally have to go along with what the rest of the team is already using.  You can't pick your company culture: it's already been established.  You can't pick your market (okay, you can't really either with your own startup).  You're stuck with the existing codebase.<p>All this is fine if you also pick up your employer's values and expectations.  But I don't know any startup founder that's like this.  Usually, if you're interested in starting a company, it's because you have some internal standards for the quality that you'd like your code to live up to and the ease with which users can use it.  So if you're working for someone else, you can easily get stuck with your own standards and your employer's tools, and the two may not match.<p>This is really, really stressful.<p>When I'm working on my startup, at least I know that any problems I'm having are <i>my</i> fault.  And I can fix them.  If I don't like the quality of the code I'm putting out, I can make the call to postpone feature X and fix bug Y instead.  If I find that a framework is becoming more of a hassle than a help, I can rip it out and replace it with my own code without my boss vetoing it.<p>There's a whole other level of stress that comes from mixing both day job and startup.  Right now, the most stressful thing in my life is wondering whether I should quit the day job to work full time on the startup.  It's stressful because there is pitiably little information and yet it's an incredibly important decision.  I won't know whether the reduced time available has caused me to miss my market opportunity until I've actually missed the market opportunity, at which point it's too late.  Similarly, I won't know whether the added time pressure has made me mortgage the startup's codebase until it becomes impossible to work with, at which point it's generally too late to fix.",1174853006

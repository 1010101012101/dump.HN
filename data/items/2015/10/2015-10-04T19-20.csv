At multinational megacorp level its considered a solved problem, often enough your boss and some coworkers aren&#x27;t even on the same continent.<p>One interesting social effect of self driving cars is I only see my bosses boss about every three months because he lives and works several hundred miles away, and I have coworkers I&#x27;ve never met in person. (note, not a remote job, just a typical &quot;dozens of billions of dollars&quot; non-tech mega corporation).  Self driving cars mean I&#x27;d probably be stuck sitting in a car while working for an entire day to meet people face to face.  For people who still believe in mystical laying on of hands, self driving cars would likely explode the amount of it that goes on, as I&#x27;ve found it weirdly true that famous projects are international, but its fractally similar in that you&#x27;re also more likely to have a boss thats 30 miles away, or a bosses boss 800 miles away, not the proverbial instantaneous jump from the entire company in one skyscraper to fully distributed.  Yes, a self driving car would be useless if my boss was in China, but things haven&#x27;t spread out geographically that fast.",1443988786

If you didn&#x27;t predict the invention of the airplane, your guesses about transportation in the future would have been pretty far off.<p>I think the questions to ask are: 
-why will anyone commute to work in the future, when telecommuting becomes more and more lifelike?
-what will &quot;work&quot; even look like? We can&#x27;t be that far away from most service jobs being replaced by computers/robots.

This isn&#x27;t the case in Europe where urban roads are considerably narrower, regardless of city size. The same can be said about Japan as a whole and other large asian metro areas - Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai, Beijing, Seoul. Much tougher.<p>Europe and Japan also have a much denser rail networks than most of the US, which in turn will cause a different impact on real estate.<p>Driverless urban buses will probably be adopted much earlier as there are exclusive bus lanes in most medium and large metro areas throughout the world but I don&#x27;t see it changing the dynamics in a fundamental way.",1443988487

10328563,comment,10328237,10328237,0,0,VLM,,,"I grew up in an older, mixed suburb; a common complaint I&#x27;ve heard from young people who grew up in other circumstances is they grew up in huge multi-square mile monolithic subdivisions with nothing to do within walking distance as a kid.  One interesting social effect of self driving cars would be &quot;mom&quot; (it always seems to be mom stuck with the job) no longer has to taxi drive their kid everywhere... Essentially every little kids has private limo service.<p>So if the closest public library is 5 miles down the interstate, a kid living there can get a similar life experience to my burb where the library was about 10 minute bike ride away.  Wanna go to the park, fine.  Wanna go to the library, fine.  If kids still hang out at the mall, they can go there too.  Friends house is 7 miles away?  The self driving car won&#x27;t care.<p>And a second-level social effect is the self driving car may eliminate helicopter parent attitudes toward kids being unsupervised... Well, maybe.<p>Another social effect people have not discussed is employers love sick employees to show up to work, cough on everyone to demonstrate their devotion to the cause, not to mention primate dominance (I can make you work when you&#x27;re near dead, not vice versa).  Often when I call in sick its not because I can&#x27;t sit quietly and appear to be busy, similar to sitting on my couch, its because I literally can&#x27;t safely drive when I&#x27;m this sick or medicated or sleepless or vomiting or whatever.  Self driving cars mean workplaces are going to be even more like a sweatshop from centuries past at least WRT illness.  The lower classes packed cheek to jowl sneezing and coughing on each other while moaning in pain...  There are people who get off on other people suffering like that and they&#x27;re going to really like self driving cars.",1443988029

10328554,comment,10327954,10328441,0,0,Licenser,,,"Yes I absolutely still work on fifo, actually 0.7.0 is around the corner right now and gets polished for release.<p>To the second question, I&#x27;ll answer that from a &#x27;out of the box&#x27; perspective so things go not off the rails because &#x27;when doing X/Y then you can also ...&#x27; because as you pointed out both are now open source systems and with enough effort you can make them do everything. Obviously I am a bit biased here, if only for the reason that I know a lot more about FiFo then SDC but I&#x27;ll try to be as objective as I can. That said I&#x27;d really would like to hear what someone with lots of experience with SDC and a bit of FiFo experience thoughts on this are.<p>The first difference to me is the heritage, while today both are open source, FiFo was born as a open source / community project and has taken this path from the first day. SDC is an commercial product that was then open sourced, which as Bryan pointed out in one of his talks is something really really complicated.<p>The second point for me, and perhaps the biggest one, is resilience. FiFo is build on the cloud premises of &#x27;everything will fail&#x27;, systems are redundant, it is master less, leverages CRDT&#x27;s to mitigate the eventual consistent data model it uses. And that is something that wasn&#x27;t added to FiFo but was part of it&#x27;s design from the start (when you heard my talk on the EUC you might remember not always successfully ;). SDC uses a more traditional design, it was build to run on a single server and now Joyent is adding failover and replication to it. (I won&#x27;t vouch for the correctness of this since it is hard to say what the design was like pre open source but it looks like this is the case from the outside).<p>The third advantage I see is that with fifo you can start with as little as 3GB as memory in a zone on your system then grow that system as you grow. You have to chose a sensible number of v-nodes but pretty much going  from 1 to 3 to 5 servers isn&#x27;t a issue and thanks to the great work Basho did on riak_core as simple as a single command. SDC comes with a own dedicated server as deployment which makes it rather resource intensive on that front. (I don&#x27;t count the COOL images that run in a VM here).<p>Fourth, FiFo runs on vanilla SmartOS, you can not use it one day, decide you want to give it a try and it will just pick up on your setup, and then toss it away the next day and everything keeps running as if nothing ever happened. SDC has special platform images and at least in the past it wasn&#x27;t as simple as not running the head node to get rid of SDC.<p>Tachyon, which will have it&#x27;s full premier with 0.7.0 but is already available as a separate package. Developed together with Lucera it is a monitoring system for servers. Based on kstat to collect metrics and a special metric database to handle the load it can handle second level resolutions for decent installations. So that gives you historic usage and performance metrics on every server and every zone in your system, which is I think unparalleled at the moment at least at this resolution.<p>What we do with backups and in result the option of cold migration of VM&#x27;s (kudos to the LeoFS folks at that point) is something new which can be quite interesting for some people.<p>Last but not least we have a dog as a mascot, which is just so much better ;).",1443987844

I could drive, but it costs too much to park and the time is wasted time, whereas I can read on public transport. If I had a self-driving car, the downside of driving would be removed, so I&#x27;d be much more tempted to drive. I guess many others would too, but London wouldn&#x27;t cope. The upshot of this is that London&#x27;s congestion charge zone would inevitably be expanded and the charge to drive into London increased still further to keep congestion manageable.<p>I suspect that most cities that have good public transport would suffer similarly as commuters are tempted back onto the roads. The inevitable response would be London-style congestion charging becoming widespread, because few large European-style cities would cope with any significant fraction of the population switching from public transport to self-driving cars. In the end, due to such charging, I suspect we&#x27;d end up back in a similar status quo once the dust had settled, with most people still taking public transport.<p>On the other had, my kids would probably love to be able to get around the suburbs without me needing to taxi them.",1443987743

You can, literally, not build enough highways for the demand. As you rack up lanes buildings get further away from each other. This means more drivers and more driving. Attempts to elevate or bury highways are only cost effective in very specific circumstances.<p>2. Peak flow (cars per minute) is at around 80km/hr, although sometimes increasing flow further is only a temporary salve, as exit points (the city downtown streets) block.<p>3. People are likely to respond to incentives. For example, dynamic pricing on the 407, higher rates during rush hour have pushed out enough traffic to maintain a high flow, even during rush hour. (Though some argue that this has resulted in more spillover to the 401, the closest competing route. I&#x27;ve yet to see a competent paper proving this either way.)<p>Consider that Uber <i>already</i> has ride sharing code in test markets. With algorithms that work together to minimize driving friction, and with surge pricing to deal with supply and demand at peak rush hour here is what I envision:<p>1. Way more capacity to get <i>close</i> to the city.<p>2. Much more expensive to get <i>into</i> the city, as capacity increases to the perimeter. With surge pricing, only the very rich will be able to afford a car alone. The poor will either get to the downtown core with a denser option (like a self driving bus) or they will get into the city at an earlier time, even if it means waiting around for work to start. Also, I see &quot;surge insurance&quot; being popular with the poor, since a 10x commute on a single bad day (due to weather or a unexpected road closure).<p>So where does this leave us? In the short term the core get&#x27;s more expensive. The closure of a few parking lots is not going to make up for the built in surge pricing of self driving cars. When the price goes up, some companies move to the edge of the core. Leading prices to go up there as well.<p>The people that really get hosed are the people in the zone just outside of that. Suburban homes no longer command a large premium, since what would have been an unthinkable distance previous years (say, 175kms from core) is now completely reasonable. A software developer can sit alone in a self driving car that drives 150 km/h for an hour, get some work done, then pick up some co-passangers for the last 25kms to offset the cost. Get in work by 10:30am leave by 4:00pm, get some work done on the way home. Maybe watch a show. By 5:30 he&#x27;s on his hobby farm.<p>Now all of this is in a relative context. If the Canadian housing market is too bubbly, and across the board it goes down then I&#x27;m just arguing it will go down more in the suburbs than elsewhere.",1443987369

We currently address the problem by granting temporary monopolies on intellectual property so prices can be established for it. This is replacing one market failure with another.<p>Think about it this way: when humans invent new ways to live healthier lives, we limit the access to these inventions for at least 20 years. Isn&#x27;t that crazy? Everyone could be living with the benefits of those ideas twenty years earlier, but in order to incentivize the creation of those ideas, we explicitly delay progress.<p>Instead, we could just pay for intellectual property as a society. This introduces a new problem of deciding the price to pay, which is what merit capitalism solves. An individual picks her own price, then decides how much others have to pay to remain part of her society of people she rewards. That is, if you don&#x27;t pay her minimum contribution, then she won&#x27;t do work for you or sell you products, nor will she work for people whose justification for their reward is that they&#x27;ve rewarded you in the past. Your rewards are cut out of her economy, which makes rewarding you less valuable for every other human. There&#x27;s one less place for other humans to go to get rewarded for rewarding you.<p>Does this lead to the optimal price of public goods? There&#x27;s no proof that it does, but I don&#x27;t think such a proof is possible. Intellectual property leads to the price that monopoly power achieves, which clearly isn&#x27;t an optimal price.

Obviously some of the jobs can&#x27;t be done unless you are physically present, but I am would like to think these jobs will get lesser and lesser. If I have to go to workplace lesser, I as well might leave far off from workplace. Also with self-driving cars will be lot as stressful as driving. I would assume self-driving cars will give us the chance to work farther from workplace. And less dependent on near to prime location.",1443986379

If you use spring-damper contact simulation, the motion is better, but the compute cost is higher.  Impulse-constraint simulations have instantaneous velocity changes, which looks wrong for large objects.  I call this the &quot;boink&quot; problem. Here&#x27;s what it looks like with nonlinear spring-damper contact simulation.[1][2]<p>I did those animations back in 1996-1997.  Havok licensed the patent rights from me, but switched over to impulse-constraint because it was faster and could be done on the 32-bit FPUs of game consoles.  Spring-damper simulation has a reputation for failing badly under high forces (&quot;Trespasser&quot;, an early Jurassic Park game, was a disaster because of this), but I figured out how to fix that.  (You have to use nonlinear simulated springs, and then, having created an insanely stiff system of differential equations, figure out how to integrate them.  This can be done well, but it&#x27;s hard to do it in fixed time, which is a problem for games.)<p>Havok didn&#x27;t do too well in their first years. They overexpanded, more or less went broke, a new group of investors and management took over and downsized, and a few years later the new investors exited by selling the company to Intel.

10328456,comment,10326434,10326434,0,0,hosh,,,"I think this really depends on someone&#x27;s stage of development for a particular issue. I&#x27;m coming from the frame that, there is no &quot;standard&quot; maturity for an &quot;average&quot; person. Each of us have pieces of ourselves that are in different stages of growth, and not necessarily because some of them got &quot;stuck&quot; somewhere. It is what it is.<p>For some people, on some issues, there is a need to assert themselves. I&#x27;ve met people for whom, some issue, left them feeling victimized, helpless, and hopeless. There&#x27;s a shift that happens when, such a person drops that sense of victimization, and develops the sense of the initiative, of agency, of being able to make choices. For a lot of people, this idea that you can make choices (as opposed to merely taking options presented in front of you) is life-altering.<p>Likewise, when you are used to making choices and having an effect on the world, all sorts of things now come up. This includes the asshole (someone acting from entitled superiority), the jerk, (someone acting as if surrounded by idiots), and so forth.<p>As one of my friends put it, the &quot;ego&quot; -- and by that, I speak of &quot;the acquired self&quot;, or &quot;the conditioned self&quot; -- likes to take credit for everything even if it is not the source of everything. That means that even humility, modesty, charity, mercy can get hijacked by the ego. I&#x27;ve met people, even meditators, for whom, the ego hijacks the spiritual development that comes out of their practices.<p>One of the things the ego can hijack is that very capability of making choices (real choice, not just taking one of the options). We have long associated the acquired self with this idea of making choices, but making real Choice ... the ego actually shies away from it.<p>It&#x27;s similar to how most people don&#x27;t actually want real Change. Real change has much more to do with death. People tend to seek out novelty, instead -- apparent change that doesn&#x27;t really change anything deep down.<p>One of the things I&#x27;ve been working on in the past week or so in my meditation is the relationship between posturing and posture. Posturing happens as a result of clashing egos. In some cases, maybe it is just one person thinking they need to posture, while no one else is participating. The noun &quot;posture&quot;, though, is neutral, associated with &quot;martial arts stance&quot;, or &quot;yoga asana&quot;. I&#x27;ve found through martial arts, there is a particular feeling that comes from wanting to win and overcome the other person, which leads to becoming physically unbalanced, and then the other person exploits that. My desire to win and submit the the other person is the seed of defeat. A lot of work went into being sensitive to balance and imbalance ... to seek out balance within myself, to upset the balance in my opponent, to correct postures and structure of the body, to learn how to break all of that. It&#x27;s only in the last week that it dawned on me that posturing is accompanied with the same kind of imbalance in the emotional and social dimension, and that by simply by dropping things to the ground, the desire to win an argument disappears.",1443985859

What will stop these people from trying to save money by putting it in the recycling instead? Fines perhaps?<p>Landfills are good because they give off methane, but recycling food and yard waste is bad. Yet isn&#x27;t it exactly those parts of the waste stream that decompose to methane and can be captured directly?<p>Recycling trucks use too much fuel but locating landfills out in the country is sensible.<p>The recycling industry is just make work for special interests, yet we should stop recycling paper so that we can keep tree loggers in jobs.",1443985441

Do-notation is nice but having a single notation for everything is even better.<p>Both haskell and ocaml currently require you to use do-notation to write async code. I&#x27;m really looking forwards to algebraic effects landing in ocaml though because with that they will be introducing delimited one-shot  continuations as part of the core language.",1443985205

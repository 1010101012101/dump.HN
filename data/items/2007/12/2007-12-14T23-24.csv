Comment on it, it resides on a separate server.<p>Hi guys: every week I'm going to update all my pages with an XML file to update the comments that reside on a separate server.<p>Like I said, the power users will not want to cede as much control or deal with so much bullshit. They want the comments on their server reflected through Google crawl. So Disqus is left with a choice if they choose to pursue the power users, sell it as a plugin and give them the code, or get bought out by WordPress or Moveable Type.",1197676014

89734,comment,89447,89691,0,0,wmf,,,"IMO it doesn't make sense for SimpleDB to be billed like EC2. An EC2 instance is using resources even when it's idle, so Amazon has to bill for that. Because SimpleDB is (presumably) fine-grained multi-tenant, it should only bill for the time consumed by query execution. It would have been clearer if Amazon priced it at 0.0000000388 dollars per millisecond or something, but then people might scratch their heads over rounding errors.",1197675022

Games mostly market to the same ""kill some pixels"" demographic, whether with guns or swords.<p>If you want to talk <i>""serious""</i> business, you're generally talking appealing to a wide spectrum of people with diverse interests.  So you have to look at the commonality of what people want -- access to information (Google), social connection (MySpace, Facebook, WoW).  (WoW's actual gameplay is niche, but there just happens to be a large supply of 11-year-olds who want to kill monsters.)  This hardly exhausts the possibilities!<p>Mate, Spawn, Die: Pick any two.",1197674534

89721,comment,89233,89710,0,0,tx,,,"Again: Why? Why do programmers think that ""from anywhere"" matters so much? Sure ""from anywhere"" has some value, but it comes at enormous expense: unbelievable reduction in functionality. Please take a look at my previous post - I think that by pushing everything onto datacenters we're moving backwards, not forward.<p>Whenever you're designing an application, a true problem solver, you have the entire internet at your disposal. Your servers, and computers of your customers - all that combined RAM, CPU power and hard drives - they are all yours. USE IT and innovate. As opposed to taking something that already exists, adding ""from everywhere!!!!"" feature, slapping ""wait... loading..."" animation onto, and chopping 90% of the remaining features off.<p>Good example would be crap by Zoho. The proper way of doing it would be taking MS Office or Open Office and adding powerful collaboration features into them - the possibilities are enormous: you can have a rich UI, tons of processing power AND simultaneous document access, collaboration, sharing, backup, etc. <p>Instead we have a bunch of cowboy javascript coders reinventing a barely working wheel (one side) and Microsoft/Sun dumbly continuing to ignore Internet in their respective ""office"" groups.",1197673721

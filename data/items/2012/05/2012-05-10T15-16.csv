A rough analogy is a physical design that has to support being constructed from either aluminium or steel.<p>Since software is more abstract in nature, you'll often hear people saying that they weren't even sure what they were building until version 2.

This, however, does not automatically make every other person in the organization meaningless drones.<p>The best products result when the visionary understands how to communicate their ideas to the development team, who internalizes these ideas and uses them to guide their efforts at every moment. The happiest moments in my day (as a product guy) come when a developer pushes a commit/feature that fits exactly with my vision, but isn't an explicit result of some directive I gave. These super-developers can infer good ideas from my product direction.<p>I imagine that in your view, developers are just there to do your bidding, but this marginalizes the developer, forcing them to perform the equivalent of ditch digging. Programming isn't easy. Those that can do it are generally smart people. Do you think the best developers want to work for someone who wishes to marginalize them in this way?<p>Because I share my vision with developers and empower them to guide the product, I cannot simply discard them.

If it is, then we 'understand' the symbol by pulling up the memory or memories tied to it.

Here are some blog posts describing my dilemma about this: <a href=""http://blog.reverberate.org/2009/11/porting-upb-to-c.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.reverberate.org/2009/11/porting-upb-to-c.html</a>  <a href=""http://blog.reverberate.org/2009/12/torn-over-c-question.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.reverberate.org/2009/12/torn-over-c-question.htm...</a>  I ultimately chose to stick with C, and I'm happy with my decision.<p>When people ask me why I stuck with C, it's difficult to give a single overwhelming reason why C is better.  The most clear-cut one is that C++ is not supported in the Linux kernel and I want my library to be usable there.  But the other reasons why I prefer C are not as easy to quantify.<p>One reason is that code written in C is more transparent.  You can look at some C and know what it is going to do (add some numbers, call a function, etc).  Macros are the one exception to this, but good C programs use these sparingly and clearly mark the macro with an UPPER_CASE_IDENTIFIER.  C++ is much harder to ""see through.""  Any function call could end up throwing an exception which does a non-local exit from the function.  Any addition, assignment, pointer dereference, etc could actually be an overloaded operator.  Any function call could be performing a user-defined implicit conversion on any of its parameters.  For overloaded functions, the compiler decides what function is actually called by applying non-trivial pattern matching rules.  The runtime will automatically invoke any static initialization code (like constructors of global statics) pre-main in an undefined order.  etc. etc.<p>I intend to get a thorough security review of my library once its design stabilizes.  I asked Tavis Ormandy (a fellow Googler and security badass) which language is easier to audit for security and he said C for the reasons of transparency I listed above.<p>People often say that you can just avoid using the parts of C++ that you don't like.  That is true, but hard to enforce, especially on a multi-person project.  If you're asking others to follow your set of rules, you have to write those rules down in meticulous detail, leading to something like the Google C++ style guide (<a href=""http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.x...</a>), and at that point you're asking your contributors to study and internalize a large and complicated list of what is and isn't allowed just for the privilege of contributing to your project.  I don't think this approach scales to lots of projects that are all choosing a different subset of C++.<p>There are definitely things I miss by not having C++'s facilities.  Constructors and an implicit ""this"" parameter are both really nice.  Constructors are remarkable in that you can write a single function that gives you three different construction patterns for free (direct construction, heap construction with ""new"", construction in an arbitrary location with placement new).  Automatic upcasts are nice and totally safe.  Inheritance and public/private specifiers let you express directly lots of things you can only express with comments in C.<p>But overall I think that using straight C is the right choice for a project like my library UPB.",1336663836

My boss being the stressed nerv-ball that he was crictized me in the same way described in the article.<p>I think there's a lesson to be taken here. Not for managers (clearly good management would criticize privately) but for the employee. Learn to take a yell. It's not good style but it's widely common, people above you scream at you when you screw up. Learn not to take it personal, and not to let such incidents affect your passion for your work. The yelling is bad form, but it's not direct criticism at you. In large entreprises, it's the result of a chain of screaming starting at the top. In startups it's the result of the nerve-wrecking stress, founders go through.<p>'Constructive criticism' is an advice we give would-be managers, but it's a luxury starting employees rarely get. You're lucky if you meet one such boss in your career. Learn to take criticism, the bad kind, leaving out the humiliation. I found the best way to cut a yelling short is by answering loudly: ""You're right I screwed up, I'm sorry. At least now I learned it, it won't happen again"". After getting yelled at like this a few times, you'll realize it's really not against you, and such an answer would calm down your boss quickly; make sure not to make that mistake again, because then you'd really deserve a humiliation ;). This is easier said (written?) than done, but it's a natural part of one's career. I take it as a mental strength test.<p>Also, you won't be the junior on the team forever.

3954013,comment,3953145,3953705,2,0,DrJokepu,,,"In France, full-time contracted factory workers get paid the SMIC (minimum wage), which is currently around 1400 per month. There are various ways to hire workers for lower wages, such as summer interns, who are typically only entitled to the third of the minimum wage. Similarly, Eastern European facilities typically pay workers the local minimum wage, which is in the range of 200-600, depending on the country.<p>It sounds like you're pretty convinced that non-western workers are less skilled so there's no point me commenting on that, but I'll try. People want to be doctors, engineers and lawyers, not lathe operators or metal workers. Training low skilled labour is really not that difficult, it's just that in more developed economies anyone who's at least a bit good at anything has the opportunity to find a better career, which is not necessarily true in less developed countries. In those countries, more skilled or competent people end up doing manual jobs simply because of the lack of opportunities.<p>Managing low skilled labour is very different from managing highly qualified professionals. These workers (whether French, Bulgarian, American or Chinese) typically can't work independently in an efficient manner and need constant supervision and micro-management, that's what foremen are for. Basically, if you want your factory workers to be productive, you have to run your factory as a Nazi labour camp. (This is obviously an exaggeration but you get my point.)",1336663781

3953991,comment,3951958,3952436,3,0,rada,,,"A couple months ago, I made a Titanium app as part of the interview process for my current employer. The app is B2B, not available through the store, so I will try to compensate below.<p>The app <i>appears</i> non-trivial to the user. There is a QR code reader that takes snapshots of industrial equipment, saves the URLs to a local database, long-polls the URLs to continually display fancy gauges that mirror actual hardware output in real time, and pops up service information when equipment stops running.<p>Performance-wise, the app <i>is</i> laggy but the lagginess is perceptually the same as similar well-established native apps. All QR/barcode scanners are slow and all data access over wireless is slow so what if Titanium tacks on an extra second or two. (I don't have any benchmarks either way, it could be the same for all I know).<p>To explain, I believe it's an established fact that to the end user, anything under 2 seconds is ""fast"" and anything over is ""slow"". There is no differentiation.<p>Productivity-wise, the app took 2 full days and several evenings to develop. For reference, my programming background is: web development - advanced, javascript - fair but hardly advanced, mobile - zero, stateful/compiled/memory managed applications - zero. As you can imagine, Titanium takes all the credit.<p>My overall impression is that Titanium is the right tool for the right job (horrible documentation notwithstanding). The lack of ""awesome"" apps is probably because it's not right for games and hardware-centered apps. To put things in perspective, I am a medium-heavy app consumer and for me personally, games and hardware-centered apps comprise maybe 25% of what's in my iPhone and iPad. That leaves a whole lot of applications that could easily be done with Titanium.<p>Go to the Apple's marketplace right now and filter out all the games. Then filter out all the apps where the app is just a thin frame for the content (I say that because I am pretty sure you wouldn't notice if Titanium was used in place of native, because of the 1-to-1 API to native UI). I bet you are going to feel that there are very few awesome showcase apps left there too. That's just the nature of the beast.",1336663501

</code></pre>
You have a company that shed a third of its workers.  A workers' council fought for and managed to win a more favorable layoffs scheme for them than the employer would have liked but they were still layoffs. [""voluntary departure plan"" is a terribly Orwellian name for a layoffs scheme]  The company seems to have justified the layoffs as a matter of economic survival rather than claiming that a third of the workers that had been carefully screened, interviewed, and hired were actually no-good bums.  It turns out that sales are now up 18%.<p>If they were great, skilled employees regretfully laid off out of economic necessity then why not hire them back now that business has taken a turn for the better?<p>The answer would seem to be that the company was not honest about their reasons for the layoffs.  Either they used an excuse to  rid themselves of undesirables and low-performers or they used the economy as an excuse to fire otherwise fine workers.",1336662084

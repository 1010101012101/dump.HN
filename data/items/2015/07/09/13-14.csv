Integrating Apple/Android devices with Microsoft would require building apps on others&#x27; platforms. This is a decent alternative strategy, but cannot be the only one. MS made their fortune by controlling the platform everyone built apps on during the PC revolution, and they know very well indeed what can happen if you&#x27;re not the one controlling the platform.<p>2. Agreed, Apple&#x27;s product strategy is very different. I was just making the point that minority marketshare is not the show-stopper many think it is. Note that Microsoft has been making decent profits in various non-software license businesses for the past few years, including consumer electronics (XBox, Surface Pro), Azure and recently, even Bing. Their revenue streams are a lot more diverse than people give credit for.<p>3.

The market also took a lot longer to mature than the smartphone market did. Microsoft has always taken a &quot;fast follower&quot; approach to emerging product categories, but this time they were just too slow. I&#x27;m not saying they never had a chance, but the writing had been on the wall for a long time when they made the Nokia acquisition.<p>Also, Microsoft was a very different company in the 80s. They were a scrappy startup that had to prove themselves, and didn&#x27;t have any legacy products, cost structures or business models dragging them down.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s impossible for a company to be successful in the smartphone space as a solid #3, just that it&#x27;s a bad idea for Microsoft to try to be that company. It&#x27;s too far from their core competencies, and it clouds the strategy for their cash cow products.<p>IMO the majority of the value of Microsoft as a company at this point is their enterprise sales network. The relationships they have there are essentially a machine that lets them print money year after year. Consumer electronics (like cell phones) don&#x27;t let them take advantage of their most valuable asset.<p>Instead of trying to chip away market share from Apple and Google, Microsoft should be going for the jugular against IBM and Oracle in the enterprise space by getting Microsoft enterprise applications on every phone, tablet and browser they can. Because that&#x27;s the part of the company that makes money, and what they&#x27;ve done over the last 10 years is essentially try to leverage their high-margin enterprise software business to create a low-margin consumer electronics division. It&#x27;s insane, and while I understand the need for products like Surface to create a baseline for quality with their OEM partners, it also doesn&#x27;t make sense to sacrifice your profitable businesses to try to make those other products a success.",1436449908

I&#x27;m thankful to Mozilla for explaining the reasons why -- it&#x27;s complicated!  noone agrees!<p>I am loathe to polyfill modern browsers adding completely needless overhead trying to chase some panacea.  At least Chrome and Firefox need to agree on (and be in the process of implementing) a feature for me to consider using it and polyfilling it.<p>The Web Components thing seemed overengineered and too much work for component developers to get wide adoption outside of widget toolkits.  All that behind-the-scenes offsetTop confusion tells me that the way Google envisioned makes it a bad fit for the DOM/CSS/JavaScript hodgepodge cruft-pile that has built up over the years.  The fact that there are so many open proposals out there for the various features should be a signal to architects to run the other way on Web Components.<p>So, into this vendor mess strides React, (and to a much lesser extent Angular and Ember due to ocean-boiling), which gives us a fancy component model atop standard DOM and JS.  And at just the right time -- web apps are far too big this decade to be coded monolithically.  I mean, everyone knows that, but what could you do about it before a decent UI component framework appeared?<p>Being able to compose your app in terms of nested components is the way build large, high-quality, well-tested web apps because it lets us reason about parts of the UI rather than the whole.  And the DOM performance with React ain&#x27;t too bad neither.  And being able to render the same React component statically on the server and dynamically on the client solves a lot more problems too.",1436447960

We replay to someone on Gmail and get spam-binned. They whitelist us, we reply again and get spam binned. We send the mail via a major provider and it gets through.<p>On Outlook a website mail form sending emails to a hotmail.co.uk address was getting blocked - the server has the same IP it&#x27;s had for years, the form has been used for years, the recipient has whitelisted the email address. I forget what eventually fixed it, think it was addition of a reply-to address; quite ridiculous.<p>In both cases they are long term domains with real ID info that hasn&#x27;t changed, the domains have been on the same IP held by the same ISP for at least 3 years and owned by the same owner used for the same businesses for at least 10 years. Both domains are long-term registered in (Google|Microsoft) analytics.<p>Yes I can see that such domains could be purchased by spammers and the prior owners may not change their ID info and the new holders may be able to purchase space on the old server and so keep the IP address (despite the established ISP having strong anti-spam policies) and may be able to then send out spam emails, but who would whitelist those emails???<p>IMO on either Outlook or Gmail if you whitelist something, even if it were spam from a known spammer, then they should let it through (sanitised if needs be).

In its 20 years of existence, the largest Haskell program ever written is the Haskell compiler itself. The largest company codebase is only a few million lines of code, and it is comprised of many programs, <i>including</i> a modified Haskell compiler (which, I am willing to bet, is their biggest program). Just for comparison, a <i>medium-sized</i> company codebase is around 50 MLOC. More production code is being produced in 2015 in Delphi, COBOL and Fortran than in Haskell.<p>This is my biggest problem with PFP: all discussions about its effectiveness are completely theoretical. Calling pertinent evidence &quot;anecdotal&quot; is an insult to anecdotal evidence. There are between 0 and 2 (much closer to 0) data points of large, complex, long-maintained Haskell programs outside the compiler itself (out of thousands of such projects that are <i>started each year</i>). I honestly don&#x27;t know how effective PFP is, but we can be certain of one thing -- no one else does either[1]. Maybe it&#x27;s the next big thing as everyone has been saying for twenty years (I remember around that time the talk at my University about how Haskell was about to take over the world) and maybe it&#x27;s a total dud. Nobody has a clue (and that you&#x27;ve managed to write your API endpoint in two hours instead of two months or whatever isn&#x27;t evidence of anything; evidence would be writing an air-traffic control system in one year instead of five, and maintaining it for a few years with a changing team of 3 instead of ten).<p>[1]: I remember that for a good few years most of the industry thought C++ is the best thing that had ever happened to it -- until projects started requiring maintenance.

All the old threads are still indexed by Google and show up in results, but these old posts reference older versions of the Parse api.

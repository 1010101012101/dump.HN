Seems absurdly large, yes, but factor in all those little thingsl, testing, deploying, etc, and lo and behold, two days plus some is gone.<p>Example2: Hmm, 2 weeks of solid (40hr week) dev time. So, 2->4->8 + 1 = 9 weeks. Woah, yeah that seems a bit large for project X.. but wait, client drags on assets, unforseen issues here and there, run into a snag for a couple days.. and boom!, almost two months have gone by.<p>I know it feels dishonest to so drastically overestimate what you Really think it will take, but the truth is the reason there is so much distrust of programmers by business people is that we so consistently miss deadlines. I know the estimate seems huge, but it needs to be, because ultimately it is very realistic, and if you beat it (doubtfully by much), everyone will be happy.<p>An oversized estimate finished early is better than an undersized estimate finished late. Always.

No mouse wheel support, non standard behaviour, etc, etc.<p>And I hate that flash 'apps' can't use the right mouse button. See Portal flash version for the stupidity of it.<p>And most of it: I hate that a single stupid RIA eats all my CPU cycles in what a desktop application would not even use a 1% of it. Ugly flash video included (I see my Internet videos in stage6, thanks).",1193514211

73233,comment,73112,73200,0,0,uuilly,,,"1)  I personally think installing plugins can be more confusing than installing apps.  Inexperienced users see, ""please install our plugin,"" and the lump sum of everything they don't know about computers falls on their head like a cartoon piano and they hit the back button.  ""What's a plugin?  Where do I put it?  How will I know it worked?""  Before flash video became huge the number one question I got from non-tech friends was, ""why doesn't this video work in my browser?""  I believe that a plugin that isn't as ubiquitous as flash is almost useless.<p>
2) I've heard of papervision.  But see #1.  I also went to their site and I couldn't get past the landing page in safari.  I'll try it in FFX later but I just would have lost every mac user who tried to install someone else's plugin.<p>
3) If flash connects to your digi camera then it can probably connect to an iPod or any other USB device.  If that's the case you've got me, I didn't know that.<p>
4) I didn't mean voip I meant phone as a device to sync contacts. But if, like you said, flash talks to USB then you've got me here.<p>
5) I used a bad example.  What if I want to edit a song in a web-based mp3 editor and bring it back to anywhere.fm.  Unless each web app has access to the other you can't do that w/o a download and an upload.  The file system is neutral territory on the desktop.  It's the place every app understands.  There is no web file system that every web app can access yet.  (I actually think that would make a mean startup though.)  Even if you're using a combo of flash, js and proxies, you still have to have an interface to the other web-app.  Is there a common web-app to web-app interface that the industry has decided on?<p>
7) You're right it is hard.  And I really do commend the people who have taken it so far.  But most of your answers remind me of the people I see camping who have solar showers, fold out chairs and a battery powered TV.  I look at them and say, ""why not just go home?""  There are a million hacks that get the job done but each one waters down functionality and increases complexity.  Almost every answer you've given involves non-browser SW on the desktop.  So we're both straddling the desktop and web-based world.  We just don't agree where the balance point lies.  I think that in most cases existing desktop apps should be connected to web-services that facilitate backups, sharing and collaberation.  You tip further toward the web end.  I'm sure there is a time and place for both.   <p>",1193512674

73231,comment,73044,73182,0,0,Shooter,,,"I also tend to think of patents as a necessary evil...a defensive measure in a world gone crazy.  I've secured a few BUSINESS METHOD patents where software is a large part of the mechanism, but I've never tried to secure a patent solely based on software.<p>
TIME: The USPTO has an expedited examination service if you qualify.  Otherwise, you may be looking at 4-6 years.  If your claim is very complicated or is disputed it can take much longer.  I just read an article about a company that got their patent approved after 18 years!  The USPTO is supposedly changing some of their processes, which will theoretically speed up the ordeal a bit.<p>  
COSTS: wayt's cost estimate is more accurate than most.  Most patents cost much more than people initially budget. I've spent as much as $225K getting a patent...and I've fortunately never had to defend one from a major company, which could skyrocket your costs into the millions.  <p>Eusman's suggestion about getting a provisional patent is a good one if you think your startup will be on firmer financial footing within the year.  You should note that you have to have not only implemented your software etc., but you have to have overcome any objections from the USPTO or disputes/counterclaims from others before the year is up.  A surprisingly small number of people successfully do that.  Most people are just giving their competitors a cheat sheet.<p>
PPAs are cheap, though, so I would almost view them as using options to protect a portfolio.  Most expire worthless, but if you need it you'll be thankful you paid for the insurance.  The words ""Patent Pending"" on your business plan and press releases can also go a long way in some circles. Just a PPA can secure that.",1193512512

It can be rewritten as<p>Foo = fun(N) -> put(var, N), fun(X) -> V = get(var) + X, put(var, V), V end end.<p>It's not as concise as Ruby or Arc, but it's a one liner.

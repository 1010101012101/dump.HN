Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not illegal (federally, with the EEOC, each state may have their own differences) to discriminate by personality test.<p>This is definitely something I saw prevalent in the hiring world: if it isn&#x27;t outright illegal, use it to prevent someone from being hired. In many cases we had clients that&#x27;d tiptoe the line and ask if certain reasons would be valid for rejecting a person, and some HR managers were upset when they learned it was against the law to disallow someone who had admitted their criminal history from being hired. So they found another reason.<p>There is still a massive amount of hiring discrimination. It&#x27;s just not the &quot;official&quot; reason anymore since that&#x27;d be illegal.

6290784,comment,6290372,6290650,4,0,patio11,,,"Let&#x27;s hypothetically say you have a new feature Foo.  Foo is under active development and works on the test and staging environments, but you&#x27;re concerned it might not be ready for prime time.  You first release Foo to your staff&#x27;s accounts on the production servers.  After they break Foo in a while, you roll it out to 10% of the user base selected randomly, while watching your automated instrumentation to see how it reacts (does it blow up anything? do users care about it? does anyone actually use the thing?).  After you&#x27;ve proven Foo out you release it to the entire userbase.  Should you at some point have a problem with Foo, you desire the ability to yank it back from all users while you get back to  tinkering on it privately.<p>Feature flags are a way to do that.  By happy coincidence, they share semantics almost verbatim with A/B testing.  (At a high level of abstraction, the most interesting API is basically User#should_see?(feature_name_goes_here).  They typically have a bit more going on in the API than that -- for example, the ability to assign users to groups (like, say, &quot;our employees&quot;, &quot;friends & family&quot;, &quot;our relentlessly dedicated True Fans (TM) who are willing to suffer the odd bug&quot;, &quot;10% of people who signed up last Monday&quot;, etc) and assign groups as being able to view a feature.

In this case naming the magic number is useful even if it&#x27;s used only once in the code.

He always gets me thinking even if I don&#x27;t always agree with everything he says.<p>I don&#x27;t think programming languages should be like instruments. I find it awkward working in Haskell or Clojure because I&#x27;m a composer and not a performer. I might be writing a rock opera one day and some chamber music the next. As a composer it seems completely wrong that I should contort my expression of my music to fit the characteristics of a single instrument. I can&#x27;t bring an oboe to a metal show.<p>The computer itself is the instrument... one capable of becoming any instrument I program it to be. One that can be programmed to generate instruments and arrange them into symphonies.<p>The notation we use for describing music is, in my opinion, what programming languages should be like. If what I&#x27;m trying to do is write a symphony there is a common language and notation that everyone understands. A symphony isn&#x27;t written alone by a composer in a room (despite what Danny Elfman would have us believe). They&#x27;re generally written by a team of people doing transpositions, arrangements, and the like. If each part is written in its own notation/language then it becomes very difficult to see the whole piece as a single composition when it&#x27;s finished. And it&#x27;s much more difficult to compose such a large work and turn it into something we can execute and perform.<p>And that&#x27;s where we are today in a number of domains such as web development and other distributed systems. We have these monstrous systems that are supposed to work in harmony but the notations used to describe them are so specialized and disparate that no one person can understand the whole piece. We have bits of systems written in C, others written in a handful of scripting languages, and run-times all over the place performing redundant work and wasting resources. It&#x27;s a time-consuming and expensive process developing these systems because few of our &quot;instruments,&quot; work together.<p>(and the problem, I believe, is deepening as we continue to develop systems-level programming languages whose ABI&#x27;s come with the baggage of run-time processes)<p>I don&#x27;t think programming languages, environments, and tools need be reduced to single-purpose instruments. I think we need languages more like Lisp and the symbolic model of computation where we can describe our processes using a notation and form more akin to rhetoric and logic that is much closer to our intent and purpose. We need the implementation of those languages to take those programs and turn our general-purpose computers, the real instruments, into virtual machines capable of executing those processes just as we describe them.",1377704502

But this is certainly not the case, and one of the reasons for this discussion is that psychologists are often married to the outcome of a test that isn&#x27;t a reliable measure of its subject. A psychologist&#x27;s confidence in a test&#x27;s unreliable results is an obvious theme in the linked article.<p>> Carefull when disregarding a whole field based on preconceptions.<p>Tell that to Thomas Insel, director of the NIMH, who recently and reluctantly decided to abandon the DSM, psychiatry and psychology&#x27;s standard diagnostic manual, on the ground that it&#x27;s becoming less scientific with each new edition:<p><a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/side-effects/201305/the-nimh-withdraws-support-dsm-5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/side-effects/201305/the-...</a><p>My point is that, when a field&#x27;s opinion leaders disregard a whole field, it&#x27;s no longer a preconception.<p>> All fields have different branches and disagreements.<p>When a medical doctor says you have cancer, it&#x27;s 99% certain you have cancer. When a psychologist says you have Asperger Syndrome, the reliability of the diagnosis is so unreliable and divorced from reality that the diagnosis has been reluctantly abandoned after an epidemic of phony diagnoses.<p>The same pattern applies to most other psychological diagnoses and decisions -- they are very subjective. Tom Widiger, who served as head of research for DSM-IV, says &quot;There are lots of studies which show that clinicians diagnose most of their patients with one particular disorder and really don&#x27;t systematically assess for other disorders. They have a bias in reference to the disorder that they are especially interested in treating and believe that most of their patients have.&quot;<p>> I think it&#x27;s because of it being a young field ...<p>Psychology and psychologists have been around making pronouncements since before the U.S. Civil War. That makes psychology one of the oldest fields that has scientific pretensions.<p>> it&#x27;s hard to agree on what the standards are to measure good/bad practice.<p>Yes, true, which is why psychology is now being replaced by neuroscience -- the latter can produce more objective results.",1377704452

6290662,comment,6288763,6289708,9,0,HelloMcFly,,,"I understand why you think that way, but there are reasons HR-related folks get involved in these types of things. Note that I cannot speak for this particular company or their processes, but I can speak generally.<p>Properly validated psychometric tests are valid predictors of job performance (by which I mean objectively and factually correlated with actual work performance), and a properly constructed work-relevant test will be <i>on the whole</i> will be more valid than subjective judgments from most technical professionals. Of course there will be hits and misses, but the consistent application is the key to its use. If you don&#x27;t consistently apply it, it becomes worthless.<p>But, let&#x27;s throw that out of the window for a second because in this particular anecdote I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s relevant. This test they were using seems more like a cultural fit, specifically a person-organization fit test. These tests are less about predicting job performance than they are about predicting organizational commitment and ultimately tenure [1]. Surely we can agree that those things are important too.<p>But, let&#x27;s again say that this candidate&#x27;s aptitude is so impressive that we don&#x27;t mind an increased statistical chance that his or her tenure may short. The <i>real</i> issue is that legally you are obligated to apply the same set of criteria all of your employees for a given role (not necessarily the exact same position, but comparable positions). If the company is applying cognitive testing, personality testing, drug testing, person-org. fit testing, etc. to one group of applicants, you now cannot fail to adhere to that criteria because it is an invitation for legal liability, however seemingly-spurious.<p>Having said that, it&#x27;s important that your selection processes have been validated previously, or at least are in the process of being validated (which provides some protection). I also have a big concern with the linked situation because: 1) it&#x27;s a cultural-related test, which means the possibility to show cultural-related bias is high and 2) they were unwilling to make language accommodations, which seems unnecessarily rigid when native-level English skills are likely not a core component of the job. Point #1 can be accounted for in some shape or form (at a minimum through a low cutoff score), but Point #2 is more problematic.<p>Anyway, there is a reason companies adopt &quot;Big Corp&quot; characteristics as the scale. The primary reason is for legal compliance through standardization of process, and the other is that data is supportive of the validity of objective predictors of job success relative to subjective judgments.<p>I realize I may be opening myself up to some criticism and scorn from HN crowd for seemingly representing &quot;Big Corporate&quot; or acting like a Bob from Office Space, but so be it. Despite what it may seem, there are often smart people using evidenced-based processes driving seemingly asinine HR processes that drive you crazy.

I&#x27;m the author of the RTP-based data channels in Chrome, and I&#x27;ve been working hard to update those to be SCTP-based data channels.  We now have SCTP-based data channels in Chrome M30 behind a flag, which will hopefully graduate to &quot;not behind a flag&quot; in M31.  I apologize that it&#x27;s taken so long and that you&#x27;ve had to do so much to work around the RTP-based data channels.  Such is the bleeding edge, I suppose.<p>Also, I think it might be a good idea for readers to update the article with a few notes and fixes.  For example:<p>- SCTP-based data channels don&#x27;t require messages to be less than 1200 bytes.  The RTP-based data channels do.  In other words, SCTP-based data channels will break up your message in chunks for you, so you don&#x27;t have to when using SCTP-based data channels.<p>- SCTP-based data channels support binary data, so you don&#x27;t need that base64 encoding when using SCTP-based data channels.<p>- SCTP-based data channels always do congestion control, so any &quot;flow control&quot; in JS is really just controlling how much data gets buffered by the browser.  It&#x27;s a good idea not to make that grow too large, but it doesn&#x27;t effect what is sent on the network, unless you let the buffer go empty.<p>- It is not correct to say &quot;to optimize transfer speeds, unreliability is key&quot;.  Doing reliability yourself on top of unreliabile mode in JS will not be any faster.  In fact, it will probably be slower.  What you may want is unordered data, meaning you can get the file chunks out of order.  But that won&#x27;t speed up getting the whole file;  it will just speed up getting a particular chunk.  If I were you, I would use reliable, but perhaps unordered mode, which SCTP-based data channels support.<p>-  The bandwidth hack for sending more than 30kpbs with RTP-based data channels is probably a bug, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend relying on it.<p>-  WebRTC always uses ICE, so it&#x27;s not accurate to say &quot;ICE or just STUN&quot;, it&#x27;s more like &quot;ICE with TURN or ICE without TURN&quot;.

That list will be long; the worst part is that all those technical drug lists may turn out to have at least one Indian working on them, our emigration is huge. To take a technical comparison, what would have happened if Satya Nadella & Sundar Pichai had stayed back over here? Anyway, that&#x27;s an argument for another day.<p>To get back to the topic, Non-Indians may benefit from the patent regime; but they got the products here in the first place.
In short, the &quot;refutation&quot; is a simple quid pro quo: the foreigners manufacture most drugs, and they get the most patents. There is no argument here on whether patents are bad, it is a stupid defense of an idiotic method of patent grants. Most Indian pharma firms have no meaningful R&D, they make their profits on generics.
Socialists like the present government will never understand a free market, if they want these expensive drugs for free, they have to pay for them somehow. Not by abusing a bad patent system which is protectionist. Either they should abolish patents (which is the best way) and take the results, or they start applying patents the ostensible way they are meant to be applied, which is to pay attention to whether the pharma breakthrough is big enough to merit a patent, or not.",1377702654

It was kind of disappointing to become aware that my reply wasn&#x27;t probably read by anybody (since there were no new posts on the thread at all). And equally refreshing to read your reply! :)<p>Thanks for a tip about posting a link on HN news, it didnt cross my mind since I usually think of it as if it is a feed with important and interesting stories for the general public. It&#x27;s hard for me to judge if my reply was interesting to anyone apart of you and a couple of other posters on the thread.<p>As about conspiracy theories, maybe I didn&#x27;t choose the right words. I don&#x27;t think about the Russian homosexual issue as a part of some grand plan, rather as a temporary and somewhat arbitrary distraction from more important issues. At least today, when Russia is more or less compliant with the West on the major issues. Even when the most of the people like to think otherwise, Russia is nowhere near waging an independent foreign policy (we can probably argue on that for a long time, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it). Also, such distractions and theme changes as &quot;Snowden revelations&quot; >> &quot;Problems of Russian homosexuals&quot; don&#x27;t even need to be conscious.<p>You&#x27;ve made a great point about Caucasus and the overall horrendous human rights record of Russia. And it is a really interesting point that the media has raised some relatively mild issue instead of, just from the top of my head, jailing of union workers that were fighting for better wages and improvement of abysmal safety controls on the factories of Western automotive conglomerates that are based in Russia. Or even something just as horrible and at the same time not strictly related to the interests of Western business. An equally interesting question is why we hear lamentations about the homosexual propaganda law now and not couple of years before, when the policy was implemented. These are important issues that you&#x27;ve raised, but the answers to them don&#x27;t lie on the on the surface. IMHO, they also don&#x27;t lie in the field of conspiracy theories, rather in the field of human psychology and the somewhat recent history of US-USSR relations. I&#x27;d really like to expand on this, but now I need to write some code, too. :)<p>Good luck!<p>It would be interesting to hear your opinion about iek&#x27;s points!

This is a really bad idea, and should be one of your top priorities to be changed.  Getting &quot;bad&quot; emails is part of the cost of doing business, so stop hiding behind the &quot;it costs us money to send emails&quot; line.  So what?!  You are eliminating users by doing this, which in the long run costs you WAY more than sending to some non-existent emails.  Just validate the email addresses so you know they exist, and maybe re-check in 30 days - that would probably eliminate most of the &quot;testing&quot; emails from your system.",1377702263

Your argument is biting its own tail: You&#x27;re saying Lee&#x27;s project was entirely driven by his name, but that&#x27;s because Lee made it so. He could have made a more convincing video or written a better text giving more info (just like Braff did) but he didn&#x27;t. My point is that he could have been more successful if he had put in more effort.<p>That&#x27;s the whole point: Spike Lee&#x27;s past films should outweigh Braff&#x27;s effort with Garden State when it comes to convincing people about their respective ability to make good films, but it didn&#x27;t.",1377702244

TSA is fundamentally trying to solve an unsolvable problem. No matter how many resources they throw at it, there will always be ways to evade their checks. A <i>smart</i> terrorist will find a way to get through undetected, find a way to avoid the check entirely (say, by bribing a TSA employee or airport employee), or will just bomb the next available target of opportunity - perhaps the security line itself. There is simply no plausible scenario in which the TSA&#x27;s checks actually <i>prevent</i> terrorism.<p>(Yes, one could postulate <i>really stupid</i> terrorists who somehow don&#x27;t realize they&#x27;ll get caught going through security, but terrorists who are <i>that</i> stupid are likely to have their plans fail without the TSA&#x27;s help.

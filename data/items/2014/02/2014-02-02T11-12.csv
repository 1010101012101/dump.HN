I think user testing is an essential part of making software more usable, but it&#x27;s not the only aspect of the design process.<p>When it comes to UX, I don&#x27;t believe you can design by committee, but everyone feels they should have a say in the process (and if you&#x27;ve contributed to the code of a project, you probably feel an even stronger sense of ownership which is perfectly natural and understandable). As soon as someone feels their UX suggestions are ignored, it causes so much resentment. The result is often a distrustful and even resentful relationship between design and development. This is such a familiar scenario in the Open Source community particularly for large Open Source projects.<p>Here&#x27;s a small example from the Blender community that illustrates the difficulty in reconciling different views about UX. It&#x27;s a Youtube video of a presentation at the 2013 Blender Conference (Oct 2013) on improving the Blender UI. In the Q&A after the presentation, one audience member (rightfully) says we shouldn&#x27;t treat users as idiots, but then adds that making Blender easier to use might entail &quot;dumbing down&quot; the app - this elicits a round of applause from the audience. Dependending on your point of view, that&#x27;s a perfectly legitimate concern or a depressing misunderstanding about ease-of-use: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aIA2LaB2Iw&feature=share&t=30m19s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aIA2LaB2Iw&feature=share&t=3...</a><p>My impression is that there&#x27;s a fractious relationship between design/UX and development in the open source community that hasn&#x27;t changed much over the years (I&#x27;m not pinning the blame on any one camp). How to solve this, I just don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m glad that we&#x27;re having a debate about it and it would be good to hear more from other developers and designers on this subject.",1391342354

7165702,comment,7164482,7164482,4,0,exDM69,,,"I have really mixed feelings about this. On the other hand I dislike this method of selling games but I also understand that it is rather difficult to make money selling $1 games. And a $5 price tag in the market doesn&#x27;t work for most games (the exceptions seem to be ones that are coming from PC/consoles: Grand Theft Auto games, Minecraft and Final Fantasy games sell for $5-$15). But this micro transaction trend has been getting out of hand, this is already the second article on the subject on HN this week.<p>I play a lot of simulator games, which have a lot of after market content. Flight simulators have a lot of 3rd party vendors who create additional aircraft and scenery (an aircraft may cost around $30 or more). The most popular train simulator has additional 1st party content, trains and routes which total up to $2000 even after discounts in Steam x-mas sales. The racing simulator I play has a subscription model and cars and tracks cost extra ($50 a year + $12 per car + $15 per track). But these pieces of extra content are very high quality and are accurate visually, historically and performance wise. I have no problem spending $10 to $30 every now and then on this.<p>But there&#x27;s a stark difference between additional content in simulators (which obviously costs money to create) and a pay-to-win IAP gaming model. In p2w games, there&#x27;s a hidden subscription fee because you essentially have to pay every now and then to stay in the game and not have to wait for ages (e.g. real racing android game requires you to buy new tires every few races, or wait for hours) and a price on additional content which is usually nothing but a piece of artwork (which is cheap to create in contrast to the accurate simulator content). The biggest problem with this is that these games are labelled as &quot;free&quot; while in reality you pay subscription + extra for additional content.<p>I would actually like to pay for games on my mobile, but I don&#x27;t want to play games that where the whole game design is optimized for maximum IAP profit rather than maximum fun. But when browsing the Android market for games, you just can&#x27;t find any interesting games that do not employ this IAP pricing model.",1391341411

This is the lemon market in action.<p>Software is different because when you sell 100k units of software, its a reasonable assumption to believe that all of these 100k units are the same piece of software[1].

You don&#x27;t like what you bought?

Front-end stuff like Angular and Ember (which require some knowledge of HTML/CSS and JS, which as a PHP guy I bet you would have). Tools like these may slowly make backend technology less differentiated on the small to medium scale as time goes on, so you can&#x27;t go wrong with investing time in frameworks like these.<p>Coming from PHP, and probably knowing some JS, have a bit of a look at Node (and Express, to get started), the concurrency model is different enough from PHP.

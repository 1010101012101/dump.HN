Shortly after your journey starts the car can say:  &quot;Would you accept a 3 minute longer journey in return for a discount of $3?&quot;  Instant on-demand car pooling as it picks up someone else.<p>Similarly the car can take you to some point 3 miles away, you switch to a larger car (&quot;bus&quot;), get within a few miles of your destination where another car takes you to you final destination.  The wait times can be very small, and again you&#x27;ll have a financial incentive (discount) or can pay full whack for a completely private experience.  The time and places where there are the highest demands on transport are the ones where self driving vehicles and financial incentives will be most effective.<p>Deliveries will become way cheaper too.

The biggest reason the news has lost its legitimacy is that 24-hour news means that a lot of news must be invented, overemphasized, or endlessly re-hashed in order to fill time.

I can&#x27;t basically gift my old car to my teen cousin while paying &quot;safe old man rates&quot;.  They&#x27;d be more than happy to insure my old car, at &quot;crazy teen boy rates&quot;.

How (and when) does the compiler check those new type signatures against already-running processes on another node?<p>Maybe there&#x27;s some very sophisticated way of managing versions using subtyping to ensure that a new version always accepts a superset of the messages that the old version accepted. That sounds like a mess, and I doubt it would actually work.<p>Even if it did, it&#x27;s solving the wrong problem. In a massively distributed system, message types are just one small part of a larger problem: protocol integrity. If you send the right message type at the wrong time, or are waiting for a message that never comes, a type system won&#x27;t do you any good.<p>So to make this all <i>actually work</i>, you need to incorporate some high-level declarative protocol specification into your distributed versioning static type system (with subtypes). Perhaps not impossible, but wow, that would be some serious research effort; and then a lot of engineering effort to make it practical.<p>I could sum this up by saying that all static type systems seem to revolve around one very simple protocol: the function call. The erlang type system can handle that just fine. But erlang also brings a lot of other protocols to the forefront, and we don&#x27;t know how to typecheck them all. Other languages punt on these problems so that they can call the type system &quot;sound&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t make the problems go away.",1422211739

It exaggerates and vilifies the &quot;enterprise programmer&quot; while lionizing the young-but-inexperienced smart programmer.  It&#x27;s a very common theme here on HN.  It&#x27;s playing into the narrative of the young entrepreneur that can drop out of college and build the next successful start-up.  The fact is that most people in that situation will fail the first few times as they gain experience.  People who can operate like Alan, though obviously Alan does not deliver results, are very valuable in a company.  Systems have a tendency to get more complex and you will need people who have experience dealing with that complexity, managing it, and reducing it.<p>Let me address the parable a bit more directly.<p>The parable is very hard for me to relate to because to me it seems like the two characters are cherry picked such that they&#x27;re vastly different in terms of skills. It looks to me like Charles is either much better than Alan at design or got lucky.  I think the only wisdom that can be gleaned from the story is to not over-complicate your design. Charles and Alan both spend time upfront designing their code, but it seems that Charles came up with the better design and saw the simple kernel of the problem.  That&#x27;s the only real difference between the two.  Alan saw a problem that needed a lot of work and specs to get right, but Charles saw it was actually a very simple problem.<p>I would say the lesson is to make sure you understand the problem well enough, but Alan is an experienced guy who still couldn&#x27;t figure it out, so it must have been a hard problem to know how to work with in the first place.  Maybe Alan was working defensively to make sure he had all his bases covered in case the design turned out to be different than he initially anticipated.  I can&#x27;t say.",1422211712

For freight, more efficient use of freight vehicles will decrease the number of vehicles needed, but I guess that will be compensated for by more demand for freight transport because it will get cheaper.<p>As to personal transport: <a href=""http://traveltrends.transportation.org/Documents/CA10-4.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://traveltrends.transportation.org/Documents/CA10-4.pdf</a>, page 5 shows that about 120 million people travel to work by car each day in the USA. To get them there in those 2.4 million vehicles, each vehicle would have to drive 50 people to work each morning and back each evening.<p>Picking a optimistic average car sharing load of 2 persons (the PDF puts carpooling at about 10%), that would be 25 trips. At a moderate 5 minutes a trip, it would take those cars 250 minutes to do that. That&#x27;s about 4 hours, so the first people would arrive at work at 07:00 and the last ones at 11:00.<p>With realistic figures, those number will easily blow up to over 8 hours. So, it will require huge other changes (job los, working from home or highly increased car sharing) to get down to that 2.4 million number.<p>I also think those who can afford a car now will want to own a driverless car, too. Reason? If you do not need to drive, your car can become more of a living room: you will want to keep your favourite books and games in it. That in itself will slow down a decrease in the number of vehicles, but there is a second factor: once your car is your living room, chances are people will be less bothered about long commute trips.",1422211594

The regulation was not desired by taxi/jitney operators nor requested/supported by the public.<p>While it is true that regulation <i>can</i> be a general benefit, it is often the case that it is supported, at least in part if not in full, by firms/industries desirous of legal protection and elimination of competition where they cannot effectively compete.<p>What &quot;we&quot; the consumers got was less regular service, areas that are typically avoided by cab drivers and thus underserved, legally enforced monopoly pricing, &quot;and other benefits.&quot;<p>>> The excess capacity of vehicles owned for personal transportation is huge. I don&#x27;t want to repeat myself, so I&#x27;ll link to another thread discussing Uber (and friends) where I participated that makes my position very clear[0].<p>> I glanced through it, I don&#x27;t find the argument convincing.<p>Let&#x27;s be clear here, the point you are explicitly disagreeing with is that there is a large amount of excess capacity in the vehicles which are currently owned and operated for personal use. To disagree you must claim that there is not much excess capacity in these vehicles. To weakly support this position you would need to argue one of two things:<p>1) That vehicles owned and operated for personal use are in use for the vast majority of the day (i.e. they don&#x27;t sit parked for more hours than they spend driving).<p>OR<p>2) That vehicles owned and operated for personal use are filled to seating capacity in the vast majority of the trips that they make (i.e. every time someone drives, they have more seats filled than empty).<p>To strongly support your position you&#x27;d have to argue both of the above. I am not trying to artificially box you into a corner, but I can truly think of no other arguments to support the premise that there is <i>not</i> a large amount of excess capacity in vehicles owned and operated for personal use.<p>>> They are providing significant competition in an industry which has seen consumer-harming regulation for a century.<p>> #1 Is it consumer-harming?<p>I argue yes for the simple fact that the supply is artificially constricted. Fares are higher than they would otherwise be and there are fewer suppliers of rides-for-hire, thus underserving geographic areas or limiting capacity at peak hours.<p>> The medallion system has limited the number of cabs on the road which minimizes the pollution and congestion they cause, it also makes sure they pay their fair share for things like road repairs since they&#x27;re using a public good for commercial use.<p>I will not divert this into an argument as to the size or costs of these effects. If pollution, congestion, or fair-share-of-costs are concerns, then the appropriate way to address this is to address the actual concerns - use costs, congestion fees, gas taxes, or any other similar policies address these concerns while also providing revenue that could (in an ideal world) be used to pay directly back into road maintenance.<p>That being said, medallions are privately owned, and the rents accrue to the holders of the medallions. Thus one of your benefits, namely &quot;makes sure that they pay their fair share for things....&quot; is not even true. The medallion system does literally nothing but reduce the number of cabs and increases the fare.<p>> Because the cars are generally awful shades of yellow or orange pedestrians, cyclists and other cars are safer as well. These are things that benefit society as a whole.<p>Citation needed. Seriously. You are claiming that the color of a car impacts the rate of accidents they are involved in. Besides this being fairly absurd, you are conflating cab coloring with regulation of taxi services. If the color of cars providing a taxi service is of such public concern, then it would be much easier (and less costly) to require enhanced visibility modifications to such cars, for example reflective sections or only allowing yellow cabs (which are not even the norm in many areas - not everywhere with cabs is NYC). Why should we resort to a consumer harming medallion system to make sure cabs are garish? What should we do about the widespread black car industry of other cars for hire that have been around since long before Uber and compatriots?<p>> #2 if it is, does it harm consumers more than it benefits society at large?<p>> Believe it or not, many people like to know ahead of time how much a cab ride is going to cost so they can plan accordingly.<p>You can easily check the fare before the ride with the Uber app, so I&#x27;m not entirely sure about the argument here.<p>> At the end of the day Uber is going to regulate the market using their market power to whatever extent they can. They simply aren&#x27;t going to bring an efficient, competitive market place where everybody wins.<p>They are not going to devote their efforts to doing so, this is correct. But the actions they are taking are moving the market in that direction anyway - for example in the parent article, it is leading to moves which will allow enhanced competition in the Portsmouth market. Even where taxi regulation change not a whit, UberX and similar (ride-sharing version, not taxi-dispatch version) will allow price competition against incumbent taxi services, and excess capacity at peak times and in underserved areas. Even if the price they can charge is restricted, the latter two benefits remain.<p>> You don&#x27;t get valued at $40 billion when all you have are easily substituted assets (it&#x27;s an app, a brand, and some logistic management software) unless you have a long term angle of somehow making massive profits which according to basic economics are assumed to be impossible in healthy markets.<p>Well, as covered extensively above, the market for taxi services is far from healthy, so there&#x27;s a large immediate opportunity for Uber in soaking up the excess demand that current taxi services simply do not fill.<p>That being said, even if Uber and similar move the taxi service and ride sharing industries toward more health, there is a huge difference between economic profit (revenue > opportunity cost) and accounting profit (revenue > outlays). Consumer electronics are a good example - there are commodity parts and labor easily available, but there are many firms in this market with healthy profit margins and prices have been tumbling for consumers for decades.<p>I am not saying that Uber and similar are identical to consumer electronics, but there is obviously a significant network effect and first mover effect which contribute to the valuations we see.<p>I read your posts as seeming to assume that I am naively painting some panglossian image of Uber as the champion of the everyman, providing cheap and wonderful transport for all. This is not the view that I hold. If my understanding of your tone is incorrect, I apologize. I would like to engage only on the salient points of the issue. I have identified several I find important and supported them above. I will summarize below.<p>1) The current regulatory regime was implemented primarily for the benefit of incumbent and municipal public transit providers.<p>2) There is excess capacity and some level of sunk cost in vehicles owned and operated for personal transportation (they are not constantly utilized or filled to capacity, but a single owner bears significant fixed costs that are not adjusted for this fact).<p>3) Medallions artificially restrict the supply and raise the price of cab services, without significant benefit to consumers.<p>4) Uber and its competitors (whom you repeatedly do not acknowledge) are providing a service that is of objective value to consumers.<p>5) Uber and its competitors are, in so doing, providing competition at a level unseen for nigh on a century to the incumbent taxi service industry.",1422211066

8943622,comment,8943297,8943461,0,0,chimeracoder,,,">  real world conditions like snowy roads and places with obscured road signs.<p>Snowy roads are actually much better in many ways for cars (theoretically) than humans, because cars have much shorter reaction time. As for obscured road signs, if self-driving cars become the norm, road signs will likely disappear, because (A) they will use wireless communication to transmit information to cars, rather than visual scanning, and (B) a lot of information contained on road signs would simply be irrelevant or redundant for self-driving cars.<p>Remember that modern cars are <i>already</i> very autonomous, even though they &quot;feel&quot; manual. Recently, I drove a car[0] that will actually automatically steer the car back into a lane if it senses that the driver is veering on the highway (ie, if he/she falls asleep or is drunk).<p>We don&#x27;t think of this as &quot;self-driving&quot; because the improvements are incremental and the driver is still present and feels like he/she is in control, but drivers have been slowly giving up control over cars for several decades now. Self-driving cars are actually much less of a leap from the status quo than people realize; it&#x27;s simply[1] the final step in a long series of incremental automation of automobiles[2].<p>[0] Subaru, I believe.<p>[1] Not that it isn&#x27;t still an impressive feat, of course.<p>[2] Let&#x27;s not forget the prefix or etymology of the world <i>auto</i>mobile - it&#x27;s not accidental!",1422209229

Once the self-driving space heats up it&#x27;s going to be piled into by a ton of entities and there&#x27;s no guaranteeing the outcome.<p>For that matter I won&#x27;t promise you 2025. But I will say that if self-driving cars truly do become practical it will rewrite the economy in a lot of ways, and that if you stop and think and analyze, a lot of them aren&#x27;t that difficult to guess, IMHO. For instance, that the nature of the capital expenditures will heavily favor &quot;renting&quot; over &quot;owning&quot; once we can easily rent on-demand is just obvious.

When the utilization of the car nears 100%, you can justify that capital expense. It doesn&#x27;t make sense for the average person to own a very expensive autonomous car, because they probably only use it two hours a day at most.

Opinion-pushers can work completely within the rules of Wikipedia, and if they collectively have more time to dedicate to pushing their opinion than their opponents, they can use the Wikipedia process to push their view to the exclusion of others.<p>Arbitration and referendums are often ineffective against this; especially when long, long threads with lots of technical details, citations and counter-citations are involved, and when the arbitrators or referendum participants are themselves biased.<p>Most people just don&#x27;t have the time or interest to read through long arguments.  So arbitrarors and voters often make decisions with scant knowledge of what they&#x27;re deciding on, or do so with a foregone conclusion in mind and without consideration of the evidence.<p>Frankly, I&#x27;m surprised that Wikipedia works as well as it does, and I still find it useful.

8188184,comment,8186633,8186633,2,0,keerthiko,,,"In addition to what people have suggested, play games. Don&#x27;t play the same game over and over, but try to focus on different games, and try to be brutal on yourself by playing mindfully (thinking hard about what&#x27;s the best way to do what you&#x27;re trying to achieve). Once you have reached a level of competency, tear yourself away from the game and pick a new one to master (this is surprisingly difficult). Board games, word games, video games, outdoor games, anything and everything. Try to mix those categories, and mix genres as well as you play (puzzle video games are an exception, have at as many of those in a row as long as they aren&#x27;t clones, because they have enough variety among themselves).<p>My understanding is that intelligence is basically the speed and accuracy at which we are able to assess and model a situation and arrive at approaches to solve the problems that are presented. Like all other things, it&#x27;s a question of being comfortable and getting used to being in situations you haven&#x27;t been in before to get faster at assessing new ones. In real life, one situation is rarely radically different from the last or next, and so our intelligence isn&#x27;t exercised as much.<p>On the other hand, games present a vast variety of circumstances, that if picked from the right pool, are completely different from each other and from what you may have experienced in real life, getting you more comfortable with dealing with fresh situations in a very low-pressure, low-stakes environment. The experience carries over to real life even when the stakes and pressure are higher.<p>Playing games is also a great stress reliever, and if you aren&#x27;t getting addicted to a single game, it&#x27;s unlikely to disrupt your lifestyle in any notable way, it may just eat into a bar night (which does nothing good for your intelligence) a week :)",1408237085

I can see a market for high-end restaurants, cake shops and confectionery shop to propose custom-made pieces.<p>What I wonder is how long it takes to print various pieces. The Pro version of the printer has a large printing volume of 10x14x8”. I imagine printing in full colour must add a significant amount of time as well.<p>Now the question is: how much are people ready to pay for a lump of sugar, however beautifully crafted it is?<p>[1]:<a href=""http://www.3dsystems.com/chefjet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.3dsystems.com/chefjet</a>",1408237057

And lest my comments come off like a back-cover endorsement, I will say that I was a bit disappointed that the authors seemed to have little awareness of SRS&#x27; momentum on the Internet with the aforementioned programs.  For example, even though the book spends quite a bit of time discussing spaced repetition and flashcards, it never once mentions Anki, SuperMemo, or other popular SRS software.

Hedonistic utilitarians believe in the alleviation of suffering and the delivery of pleasure (in the sense of such things as comfort and intellectual pleasures as well as baser pleasures). This is in the tradition of John Stuart Mill, and many English thinkers, including socialists such as Orwell, take this premise for granted. The phrase &quot;the greatest good for the greatest number&quot; is commonly used as a description of this kind of hedonistic utilitarianism. The type of socialism that Orwell subscribes to is meant to be an attempt to achieve this end.<p>By my reading, Orwell is giving Hitler a bit of credit, not only in the fact that he rejects this premise and emphasizes patriotic and militaristic virtues above quality of life, but that he could move an entire nation to agree with this vision. What Orwell means here is that people don&#x27;t just want comfort and prosperity; they are in fact willing to actively sacrifice these things to achieve a vision, especially one expressed in warlike or patriotic terms.

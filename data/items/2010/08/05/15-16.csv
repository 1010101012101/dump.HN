The reason they are able to do it is that they have already established a fixed set of agreed upon design patterns that appear in their apps.<p>If you skip directly to css and html, it's very difficult to think like a designer because you feel all the constraints of css and html. You'll think things like ""oh, yes, I'll put a 5px border here and make it have 5px margin from the element above because it's easy"" instead of ""wow, this block would be interesting if it overlaid the top block"".<p>In photoshop, it's easy to experiment visually by moving around blocks. In CSS and HTML, it's a pain. (Although, tools like firebug and web inspector have made certain things easier, not all of it is).",1281023999

1578402,comment,1577992,1577992,0,0,mbateman,,,"There's a reason why modernism is modern and the rest are mostly historical. A lot of historical approaches to aesthetics are overly flowery and complex by today's standards. This is because in the historical context the fact that any of this was possible was remarkable and something to be emphasized. Today most people don't think it's that remarkable that you can cram a bunch of flowery crap into something, or make it super-intricate and fragile and still transport it. Those are solved problems.<p>With that said, however, I love Art Nouveau, Art Deco, and a bunch of less minimalist (compared to Bauhaus) modern styles. But they are minimalist compared to those historical styles. In some ways they are partly a streamlining of the more interesting parts of some of more historical styles. They aren't ""minimalist"" in the technical sense of that term, but I'm not sure that e.g. Apple's products are minimalist in that sense either.<p>It's hard for me to come up with examples of things that are really totally non-minimalist, like Baroque, that I'd like to see in e.g. software or computer hardware... Maybe some of the spinoffs of Russian constructivism. Some of them aren't really minimalist at all, and many are awesome.<p>EDIT: Here are some examples of non-Bauhaus-style web design that are still modern. Might be better than looking at historical architecture.<p><a href=""http://www.pho-ku.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pho-ku.com/</a> -- The Designers Republic (Russian constructivism inspired)<p><a href=""http://joshuaink2006.johnoxton.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joshuaink2006.johnoxton.co.uk/</a> -- web designer's blog I've always found pretty :)<p><a href=""http://www.happycog.com/create/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.happycog.com/create/</a> -- there's a good variety here, most of which could be construed as minimalist, but none of which seems Bauhaus-y.",1281023497
1578401,comment,1577538,1578335,0,0,gaius,,,"OK, in economic terms, I don't think outsourcing as often practiced in services and high tech adequately accounts for externalities. If someone is incentivized - through say a bonus system - to prioritize the short term over the long term then that is what they will do. If this means closing a call centre in the West and opening one overseas, then that might make perfect sense <i>right now</i>. Will it make so much sense when customers go elsewhere? That is what I mean when I say that a race to the bottom ultimately destroys rather than creates wealth. Some of your customers will go elsewhere. Some will simply stop using that product or service altogether.<p>There are already signs this is happening; Nat West (a UK high street bank) are now advertising ""only UK call centres"". Now, it doesn't matter one little bit that their cheque processing is done in India, that is, to borrow a bit of programming jargon, referentially transparent. That is just one example.<p>So what I am afraid of? I am afraid of being personally inconvenienced by the interests of the organizations I transact with being further misaligned with my own.

Good design takes a lot of time and iteration.<p>The second class of designers are interface designers. While web designers care about the marketing of a product, interface designers care about the functionality of the product and how to make it easy to use. Just because you are good at one doesn't mean you will be good at the other.<p>Interface designers are rare and go for $100+ an hour if they are really good.

Art helps to evolve us. It's also probably impossible to define the ""necessary"" components for most art.<p>However, I think there are shades of gray in the question of minimalist design for websites. Web applications aren't like Melk Abbey, Queluz Palace, or the Grand Palais. They aren't meant to be <i>beheld</i>. They're meant to be used at an intricate level, and it can often be harder to do that when there are ornamental or otherwise decorative components to the design. I still think the author's thesis is true - that minimalism isn't the end-all of design. But I do think that - on balance - minimalist designs are more effective than other designs for web applications.<p>Other kinds of websites (Some websites <i>are</i> meant to be beheld, after all) can lose value with a minimalist approach - or not.",1281022869

Imagine a new legal landscape where high-quality services are affordable. Imagine deals getting done, because the attorneys don't kill them, with overlawyering and overcharging. Contemplate court cases and other disputes being resolved on their merits, rather than simply on the basis of whether one side cannot or will not pay the absurdly high costs of litigation. Think about legal professionals located in places that suit the interests of clients, rather than in the most expensive parts of the most expensive cities in the world. Consider the resultant savings when legal bills are based on services, not real estate. Envision deals and cases staffed by the most talented and enthusiastic lawyers available.

So it could be that some investors are making very good returns, some very bad, some just meagre returns. Just giving an average number doesn't quite help. It is like saying the average high school grade is C. That hardly says much about an individual student. So too the data hardly say much about an individual investor or specifically whether to invest in such companies is a good return for someone with cash, unless of course you are able to invest in all the 1000 companies.<p>I personally think it probably is a good return to invest if you have great business knowledge, but seeing as 56% do not return capital, its a greater possibility that it would not be a good idea to invest in the companies.

1578283,comment,1576446,1578111,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"""but no alternative courses of action being put forth that don't involve me becoming a terror target.""<p>The United States (along with other European countries including Russia and other non Islamic countries like India)  <i>is</i> a terror target irrespective of what it does in Afghanistan. If you are an American, you are (in the abstract) a terror target already and have been for a long long time. The odds of you specifically dying in a terrorist attack are (and always were)  very slim.<p>No amount of destruction in Afghanistan will change that.  Americans <i>will</i> die in future terror attacks whether you pull out of Afghanistan or not.<p>And no you don't have to have a ""solution"" before you say ""This is not working"". By that logic civilians could never decide to end a war. That is hardly democracy. There was no ""solution"" to Vietnam when America quit. That happened because American civilians  made a decision they didn't want to keep paying in blood and treasure to ""win"" a faraway quagmire of a war.<p>""Pull out"" is just as valid a suggestion as ""stay on"". You'd still be fighting in Vietnam if ""stay and fight till victory""  were the only choice to end a foolish war.  A suggestion has to be opposed with reason,  not rhetoric like ""But ...  But ..  that will make us terror targets"" and ""Our generals surely know what they are doing (if American history is any indication this is a very dubious claim)"" or ""You aren't a general How would you know?""<p>The 9/11 attackers were Saudi but you guys went to war with Iraq.  The present day epicentre of Islamic terror is Pakistan/Saudi Arabia but you guys are fighting in Afghanistan, all the while funding the Pakistanis who fund the Taliban. Wtf?  A war in which you fund the people trying to kill your soldiers, and your ally's intelligence services train and provide safe havens for your enemies is not winnable.<p>The next Islamic terrorist attack  could come from Somalia or Yemen or  the United Kingdom or the Balkans or Saudi Arabia, or Iran or Indonesia or Turkey or Egypt.<p>Are you going to war with all of them (and stay a few decades in every ungoverned badland on the planet)? If not why do you want to stay in Afghanistan? What is the plan for ""victory""? And how is ""victory"" defined anyway?<p>I (personally) want America to win (I am in general very pro American and I take some flak for it locally) but ""stay on till the Taliban is no threat"" is an impossible goal for victory. You don't have enough  money (trillions more),  or  the time it would take (many decades) or the fortitude to absorb the required  casualties  (tens ofthousands ),  to have even a low chance of success.",1281021284

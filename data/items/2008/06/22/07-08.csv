I'm talking from experience, i tried to be bad and girls just think im creepy. :)<p>Anyway check <a href=""http://www.highstatusmale.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.highstatusmale.com</a> and  check the book ""without embarrassment"" its good not only if you want more girls, but if you only want a little more understanding of the way humans communicate, entrepreneurs might find it interesting to find how they can be the wright amount of bad to be able to talk to people and BE THE ALPHA MALE in the conversation. I had bad luck with girls, but didn't have low self-esteem and didn't knew where the problem was. I read the book and i found out that i was doing almost everything right. So i started thinking why? And then i realized i was sabotaging myself. Most girls i knew were boring people, so my subconscious decided to sabotage me so that i wouldn't hang out with boring people and after i realized that i still don't like boring(hot) girls. So some of us have a problem with girls not because of low self-esteem, but because of too high self-esteem(how i wish i wasn't so picky :D).",1214121583

He doesn't know 'Lycos' was taken from the name of a spider, nor that 'Architext' was the original name of Excite.<p>I'd agree Brightmail, PayPal, and IronPort are great names. But Lycos and Xobni are pretty good names, too. His case against them is weak -- and his criticism of Xobni is actually its strength: now that he knows it's 'inbox' backwards, will he ever forget it? (Vidoop may have issues, but it depends on their market.)<p>And the novel suggestions he makes -- PermaPage and ArchWeb -- are literal and clunky.<p>If you need outside advice on naming your company, demand some stronger linguistic/naming reasoning and experience.",1214120206

Kind of like how everyone can count on GCC.<p>I don't write much Java now but at one time I supported a database library on runtimes from sun, ibm, apple, microsoft and the blackdown guys.  It was crazy. Java and Python have been around for about the same amount of time.  Python has about 5 different VM implementations.

He's not buying things in dollars at US prices, he's buying local goods and services at local prices. He's interested in his purchasing power in whatever economy he happens to be in, so regardless of the dollar amount, he's wealthy in Bulgaria but would be only average in Dublin.",1214120069

1502901,comment,1500872,1502469,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"You'd think that, wouldn't you? But you'd be wrong. Don't feel bad - I was pretty surprised as I learned more about the subject too (IANAL but am planning on a law career, and already having an interest in this I figured I might as well learn it properly). The law and administration of immigration have been patched and reorganized so many times that the subject is an elective on most law school courses.<p>Unlike most other branches of law, the scope and administration of which are constitutionally limited, immigration is plenary law - an area in which the government has absolute power and its actions are not subject to judicial review unless otherwise stated (going back to the Supreme court's decision in the Chinese Exclusion Case in 1889, holding that where aliens are concerned, only property rights are constitutionally protected and others may be revoked as the government sees fit). So the ability of the courts to entertain petitions for <i>Habeas Corpus</i> in immigration cases is quite limited (and defined by statute), and other kinds of legal action (eg certification of class action suits) are off-limits altogether.<p>In cases where the jurisdiction of federal courts is at issue, the government often argues that the terms of a visa or similar document an agreement or bargain (but <i>not</i> a contract) between the US and the alien, formed outside the US for legal purposes. It is thus asserted to be a private matter between the government and the individual, outside the scope of judicial review. The Attorney General or the Director of Homeland Security has more or less absolute discretion in such cases.<p>This leads to some odd outcomes. For example, if someone sneaks across the border and is later arrested and tried, they have full constitutional rights. If at any point they are handed over to DHS, they have the right to a hearing in front of an immigration judge (part of the DoJ) to determine their legal status, and can appeal any decisions to either a special immigration appeals court in DC and/or the federal courts (depending on exactly what the situation is). The same is approximately true of someone who overstays or commits a crime violating the terms of their visa. On the other hand, some 30 million people visit the US every year without a visa as tourists. If a DHS officer determines such a person has violated their conditions of entry they can be arrested and deported or detained pretty much at will, with no opportunity for a hearing at all (unless they claim asylum, which of course happens all the time as a result). The government's current view is that such persons have no constitutionally protected liberty interest, putting them outside <i>Habeas Corpus</i> altogether.",1278729360

Someone cheating, assuming they do it right (and don't over do it), will probably get more than they deserve (in an idea world) before they die, if they did everything 100% by the book. Simple karmic forces (the cause-effect force) dictate that if you cheat constantly, you will increase your chances of being caught and punished. However people don't live forever, so it's highly possible they will get more than they deserve in their lifetime if they cheat.<p>I think if you look at it from afar, you may not notice the inequity caused by cheating. I really can't really say how much cheating impacts society, but I definitely disagree with you on your claim that cheating is always (or at least to a point of insignificancy) caught/punished accordingly.",1278729283

1502886,comment,1502027,1502677,0,0,ww520,,,"The way to approach Conde is to present a concrete business plan for <i>monetization</i> and ask separate budget for it.  What you have in place now is <i>operational</i> budget, just to keep the site up.  If you ask them for more money to expand server capacity to support more page view, they will roll their eyes saying, great, sinking more good money into the operation hole.  Business people see operation cost as something to cut, unless it brings in additional revenue.<p>Tell them your priority has shifted from gaining market share (page views) to bigger margin (profit=revenue-cost).  Business people like increasing margin.  And tell them you need to do a number of experiments to figure out what work, which cost additional money.  Tell them there are two options: 1. give a new budget for monetization while keeping the existing operational budget, which is already thin in keeping the current site SLA.  2. Cut the operational budget in half, reduce site SLA, and divert the other half to monetization.  Reducing SLA means having less servers, less operational staff, slower site, more crash, less visitors coming in, and some unpopular moves to increase conversion.  But that's ok since as part of the plan you've stopped seeking for market share.<p>Be bold and ask more for a new budget.  Say you need 20 more racks initially, 9 sales, 2 marketing, 2 biz dev, 4 more engr, and 3 managers.  And need 20 more backend servers for the new initiative; dealing with merchants aren't cheap.  You need the sales guys to sign up merchants, the marketing guys to figure out what work and manage ad campaigns, the biz dev guys to recruit big merchants like Dell or Amazon and managing ad inventory, and the engineers to build up the merchant facing infrastructure.<p>Excite them by painting huge upside monetization potential, which is true.  Targeted CPC can be very lucrative, like minting money.  Online merchants typically will budget 10%-15% on marketing, which is what pays CPC.  Think how big the online ecommerce is and take 10% of that.  That's why those merchant specific subreddits, deal/coupon, whatnot are so important because the redditers clicking out from those links are very qualified leads for the merchants who are willing to pay dear money for them.<p>If Conde is still unwilling to invest, then that's just life.  Stop investing in increasing operational capacity.  Accept the fact that site will run slower and have less visitors.  That's fine.  That's the max capacity of the site given the budget.  Just enjoy the ride.  And wait until Conde sells it to someone else who's willing to take it to the next level.",1278728911

And I don't mean the musicians, since that's not really what they are there for, I'm talking the management.<p>When demand drops, you have to have some combination of lowering the price, lowering the supply (smaller venues), or having excess production (in this case, empty seats). It doesn't matter if you blame the customers (really stupid), blame the economy, or blame the moon, some combination of those three things is going to happen. The laws of economics demand it. Most industries have money people that seem to actually understand this.<p>(The natural <i>hurr hurr</i> response is to claim this is because they are used to just lobbying for things from the government, but it goes beyond that, just as in this article in which they appear mystified about what to do with empty seats and someone has to actually suggest that maybe the price needs to be dropped.

You should be able to easily pull at least $2 CPM from general/frontpage reddit traffic, and probably closer to $10 CPM from specific subreddits. At 280M pageviews, that's over $500K a month in revenue you're missing out on.<p>If I had to monetize reddit right now, I would throw up some CPM ads from a premium display network, and then begin aggressively going after big brand advertisers and media buyers. This might mean spending money and hiring at least one ad sales person- but the investment will recoup itself many times over when media buys from big brands start coming in.<p>Right now, reddit is doing a TERRIBLE job of managing ad inventory, particularly remnant inventory. It also doesn't look easy for advertisers to place ads on reddit. I see a contact form for more information about advertising, but where is your media kit? User demographics?
Not all ads are bad, only untargeted ones are. Why aren't there ads for Newegg, or Snorg tees, or collegehumor, etc on reddit? You're in a position to demand premium CPM from advertisers and you're squandering the opportunity.<p>Right now the ad I see on the front page is ""advertise on reddit"". This is a terribly wasteful use of remnant impressions, as 99% of your users won't be interested in buying ads, and there is no reason to show them this ad. It will take a few minutes to fill that remnant inventory with a reputable brand ad from a display network.<p>I understand that you don't want to piss off your users with ads, but Digg manages to generate revenue with strategically placed banner ads without any outcry from users.<p>I think this problem isn't unique to reddit- it seems like a lot of startups run exclusively by engineers have trouble monetizing intelligently, even when they get significant traffic.<p>My email is my profile if you want to chat about this further, I can send some links to the kinds of offers redditors might respond to or help you reach out to media buyers who might be interested in doing large buys on sites like reddit.",1278728767

Those veins were played out 10 years ago. Their fans are older, and don't have the time or money to go out and see these acts.<p>But that's alright. The great thing about music is there are always talented upstarts willing to do the work on the ground floor in terms of songwriting and touring. Some of them will have no trouble bypassing the stadiums and Ticketmaster, and will sell out smaller clubs and connect with their fans in other ways, including online.

The thing is, I can see how thats likely intentional. It is obvious fb wants you to do certain things like share all your crap with friends all the time everywhere and anywhere. So everything that has to do with updates, pics, and the wall, well thats beautifully and easily within reach. But anything else....good luck.<p>To be clear, I don't use fb, but I opened an account so that I can learn the api and make some page apps. The documentation is old, sporadic, a pain to find, and ...broken. Locating simple things like where my pages are seems to take me forever!! I just have a hard time finding anything on fb that doesn't have to do with status updates and ""the wall"".<p>Course I am hardly an ""average user"" and half a billion people seem to think its good, right? right?<p>Any thoughts on this?",1278727329

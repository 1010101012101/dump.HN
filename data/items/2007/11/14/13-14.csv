There is a huge amount of goodwill amongst YC readers and this may be better accessed through a new part of the YC site rather than ""Hacker news"", eg perhaps you can build something in to allow readers to describe their skills/ideas and the type of YC readers they are either hoping to contact or happy to help etc.Just a thought.",1195047312

He could have made a great deal more, of course, but Stein had trouble getting Atari and Mirrorsoft to pay him royalties for the (bogus) rights he sold them....In 1996, with the financial backing of Henk Rogers, he [founder Pazhitnov] organized The Tetris Company LLC, and is now finally getting royalties for his creation.""",1195046801

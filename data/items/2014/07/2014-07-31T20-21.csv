Having been one of the early miners of BTC when it was under 25 cents and then an eager proponent of Ripple at its inception I feel disgusted and betrayed by the behavior of two particular people: Jed and Mark Karpeles. And yes, they deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. I was one of the lucky ones who did not lose any money, so this isn’t about sour grapes. I trust them about as far as I could throw a heavy safe, and I&#x27;m not very strong. Protocols may be game-changing and robust, but I learned the hard way that if the people behind them suck, supporting their schemes will likely make you a sucker. Protocols don’t create trust, people do. I’ll acquire stellars for free, but no more putting USD behind another one of Jed’s self-enriching money-making schemes. He’s very good at profit-taking for himself and is fearless in the art of self-promotion.",1406840388

8116916,comment,8116664,8116664,2,0,jdubya,,,"I worked for one of the largest load balancer/application delivery controller company for a grinder of a boss on a security team there.<p>My job was to hack shit, find vulnerabilities and write automation for attacks that our systems could prevent. There were 4 pretty big code bases (>100k lines) that were used for the same thing. There was no inter-team effort, everyone wanted to roll their own rather than working together because the bosses had huge egos and wanted their name in the brick.<p>I was tasked with building a new framework!<p>So yeah, five different automation frameworks, one for automating attacks against devices and servers, one for smoke testing (pound the box with traffic) etc. Mind you all of this shit could be done with a single framework because many of the tasks were similar. So I created a way to build test profiles from our test plans and consolidated the code bases. I learned a shitload about dealing with existing code during this effort. It was awesome in that respect, I learned how to deal with poor management decisions - execute better than they ever did.<p>Long story short I refused to scrap everyone elses hard work even though my boss told me to &quot;build it from scratch and use it for the security team only&quot;. The reason being is because starting from scratch would have incurred more technical debt than the consolidation effort took. Mind you every other department in eng could have used said framework. Anyhow, under the radar I went about consolidating the other four frameworks and I gave my boss the timeline without his knowledge of what I was doing.<p>Three months later every eng department was using this new framework using the tools that they were used to using for deployment and verification, just a new ui and a lot of code that was cleaned up and everyone was pretty happy with it to be honest. Everyone that actually used it that is.<p>My boss, who never used any of the frameworks, got pissed off that I did not build a sec. team only framework and asked me to build a version only for the security team for &quot;security reasons&quot;. This was the proverbial straw that broke the camels back. This fucking moron wanted to satiate his own ego at the expense of my peers time, health and the company. I don&#x27;t really care too much for the company but everyone I worked with was very competent and I did not want to just throw the baby out with the bathwater. That would be stupid.<p>Long story short, I was interviewing at places at the time and got an offer that very day so I decided to take the offer.<p>Moral of the story:<p>Don&#x27;t have your engineers build 4 different automation frameworks and then ask an engineer to &quot;rebuild&quot; a custom version for a bullshit reason. Don&#x27;t build shit from scratch unless you are learning/experimenting and at large companies, they rarely reward experimentation.<p>I get that this might not exactly be technical debt but 4 frameworks and the effort I had to put in to the consolidation was brutal at times. Improperly used technology, poorly deployed interface supporting services and solutions for transient failures of tests being &quot;just reboot the test box&quot; was too much bullshit for me.<p>God I fucking hated that job. I will never work for a large, well established company again if I can avoid it. My startup might be getting picked up soon by a conglomerate and I have 6 months left on my vest. If we end up at the conglomerate I am going to quit and take a few years off working.<p>That is my experience.",1406839855

8116889,comment,8114919,8115752,4,0,dparoski,,,"First, I want to thank you, Paul, for writing this critique. It&#x27;s great to read well thought-out feedback about the draft spec that was announced yesterday.<p>Before getting into technical nitty gritty, I wanted to clarify that the spec in its current state is a draft offered to the PHP community as a starting point for specifying the PHP language. It now belongs in the php-src repository and can be updated through the standard commit processes for that repository as the community sees fit. Some decisions about specificity were made for the initial draft, but these decisions are by no means final and the hope is that the community will settle on what&#x27;s right for the PHP ecosystem overall.<p>Regarding RAII, I&#x27;d argue that __destruct methods in PHP are a bit different than stack-allocated variables in C++. Stack allocated variables in C++ have a strictly defined lifetime based on the scope of the variable. In PHP on the other hand, objects are heap allocated and when they are destroyed is not as well defined. For example, you can have a cycle of two or more objects pointing to each other that are unreachable (i.e. cyclical garbage), and it such cases any __destruct methods for these objects are not immediately invoked when the objects become unreachable. I considered requiring refcounting-based automatic memory management for the initial draft of the memory model, but describing in detail cyclical garbage felt really implementation specific and so at a gut level it seemed better to not require RC-based automatic memory management and see how people reacted.<p>Based on my personal programming tastes, I&#x27;d argue that try/finally is a cleaner, more robust way to ensure certain cleanup happens when a scope is exited rather than relying on __destruct. However, I understand that there are some PHP programs out there that rely on __destruct being invoked eagerly in non-cyclical-garbage cases, and that such code will probably exist in the wild for a quite a while regardless of whether try/finally is &quot;superior&quot; or not. I&#x27;m curious to see how this issue settles over time.<p>For the record, HHVM uses RC-based automatic memory management and will eagerly call __destruct on objects that become unreachable that are not part of cyclical garbage. The initial choice to be a bit more liberal about reclamation was not essential to make sure that HHVM was compliant with the spec.",1406839544

8116848,comment,8116047,8116652,15,0,pyduan,,,"> I would presume a highly-skilled fraudster could just spin up a new VM, for instance, and evade detection that way.<p>From my experience building fraud detection systems at Eventbrite most fraudsters are not that sophisticated -- fraudsters usually go for the lowest-hanging fruit and as such are looking for systems to defraud that have the highest payout for the lowest effort. Because there is always some level of uncertainty (getting detected, the credit card not working, etc.) fraudsters often favor techniques that allow them to try as many websites/cards as possible. This is especially true for Sift Science&#x27;s customers who tend to be more small to mid-size companies; big companies for whom fraud detection is critical will tend to have their own in-house solution.<p>In addition this is usually only one signal -- ideally you want your algorithm to be able to detect first-time fraudsters too, so the other signals should be able to stand on their own.<p>One caveat though, the reason why multiple accounts is a signal of fraud is because fraudsters tend to be repeat offenders, and will keep defrauding the same website if their previous attempts worked. But now that they&#x27;re facing a fraud detection algorithms that detects repeat offenders more easily, it&#x27;s highly possible they will adapt their behavior.<p>This is a signal that will fade out in strength over time, and one of the dangers of pooling together data from multiple websites as in this blog post (but hopefully this is taken into account in their algorithms) is that the strength of the signal may be skewed by the proportion of new users of their platform (who will have a higher proportion of unsophisticated fraudsters by nature of they not having a fraud detection system previously).<p>This is why whenever you are building a fraud detection algorithm (or any machine learning algorithm that&#x27;s consumer facing) understanding the story behind the data is very important, and not just looking at the numbers.",1406839162

So if I had something ready to go today that would be fine but I don&#x27;t - and by the time I do have something to go I may well have forgotten about this.<p>Agreed, and feedback like this will help me hone the time limit and other things. The program isn&#x27;t ending any time soon, but I hear you loud and clear on the 12 month limit.<p>> If this is an attempt to get to the section of the market currently filled by the likes of Digital Ocean (to name but one) then this might be the wrong way to go about it. Personally, I want to be able to start small (VERY small, like FREE), and scale it up as I get customers.

I&#x27;ve put comments in other threads, but this is not an attempt to go after VPS providers. It is not an attempt to dissuade people from adopting VPS providers. A cloud server and the associated technologies is different than  what a VPS typically offers, and is designed for different architectures. The costs and the way you build your application (should be/are) different.<p>> So maybe you could offer something cheap and small as opposed to the &quot;big or nothing&quot; attitude that Rackspace seems to have. If I knew I could start miniscule but go all the way up to massive with the same provider then that&#x27;s a big selling point for me.<p>For me, ideally we remove the time limit.

8116638,comment,8114188,8114188,0,0,zackmorris,,,"Wanted to jump in and ask, does anyone remember a site that went through the math of two magnetic rings being charged and discharged out of sync, utilizing the delay in the speed of light between the rings to create a net force?  Imagine a craft shaped like a dumbbell, with the rings where the weights are:<p>|---|<p>1...2<p>The idea was that you&#x27;d create a strong magnetic field in ring 1, and then the wave would travel outward both directions (one away from the ship, and one along it) and interact with ring 2, which has the opposite polarity.  Ring 2 would be attracted to the magnetism from ring 1, and pull the ship to the left.  Then ring 1 would turn off, and by the time the wave from ring 2 reached it, there would be no interaction.  So the craft would feel a net thrust to the left.  The process would repeat over and over again at high frequency, propelling the craft faster and faster.<p>I believe the site said the process was 25% efficient, and didn’t violate any laws of physics.  The difficulty lies with hysteresis because it takes a comparatively long time to charge a magnetic field, compared to the time it takes light to span the distance.  So it went off on a tangent about using lasers to charge a superconducting ring.<p>But I’ve always wondered if resonance could somehow be used to take the coils out of sync automatically, a bit like a tesla coil but with an imbalance the puts one ring slightly behind the other in time with respect to their frames of reference.  As they move more out of phase, the net force on the coils should get stronger and stronger.  This sounds similar in some ways to the the way a magnetron works, so if it can be put out of phase in a similar way, then I’m not entirely surprised by NASA’s result.  If it’s true that the time delay in the speed of light can be converted to a propulsive force, then it’s going to change, well, pretty much everything about space travel.  I really wish I had the link to that site.",1406837008

It is enough if they become known as the best place for self-motivated, bright people to get an education. When that happens, MOOC will be the new college. That is, completion of a course of study from a MOOC provider like Udacity will be a strong signal to employers that a student is quality.<p>At that point, the question employers will be asking traditional students is: why didn&#x27;t you do your education online where it is faster, of better quality, and much cheaper?

Obviously I&#x27;m a sample of one, but I just wanted to give a personal account to match your own.<p>The classroom setting is important because it sets up social expectations and accountability. I tend to blow off MOOCs partly (there are obviously other reasons as well, including the fact that they are free) because there is no scheduled time. There is less pressure and it is up to me to make time, it isn&#x27;t blocked out for me. I also get bored more easily in MOOCs because the communication only flows in one direction, from the teacher to the student. I can&#x27;t ask questions or challenge assumptions during lectures.

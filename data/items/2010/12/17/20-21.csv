(it's free)<p>I worked in the Israeli Occupied Territories during the Second Intifada (long story), and while I was there, I became fascinated with the ancient graffiti scratched on artefacts in the West Bank. I used to wonder who scratched it on, and why they did it.<p>Kee aims to give people the ability to create overlapping virtual graffiti with the answer to all those questions. Functionally, the app attaches content and thoughts to spaces and objects, access to which can be set to public, friends only or private.<p>We basically want to make the physical world a communication medium, where you can open a Kee Map, see what people have said about the space you're in, and make comments yourself. So far, one of the things that we've enjoyed doing most is dropping Kees on street art so that people can comment on it and see where to find it.

2017738,comment,2016843,2016843,0,0,nkurz,,,"I'm a late thirty-something college dropout, and have yet to regret leaving.  I attended a fine small liberal arts school (one of those that rotates through the top three spots of the rankings) and attended for three non-consecutive years.   I'd start each year with a love of learning and a sense of potential, and finish each one hating the world and most everyone in it.<p>I learned an awful lot there, but a lot more from the environment than the actual courses.  I learned about money (I'd never really seen it before), I learned about class in America (we didn't have much of that growing up in Wisconsin), and I learned about a lot about cultural relativism (theory and practice).  Given a chance, I would highly encourage anyone to attend the best institution they can possibly gain entrance to.  It will be eye opening.<p>But actually getting a degree?  Optional.  It always felt to me that the certification was at odds with the education.  Instead of learning anything in particular, I was being taught to juggle, and to not care too deeply about what I was keeping in the air.  This is likely of great value to an employer, but as an individual I want the freedom to care deeply about the content, and never found this to be possible in even an excellent liberal arts college environment.<p>Financially, I'm probably doing worse than most of my peers who stuck with it.  But I think this is more a factor of my personality than the lack of a degree. I left the final time to work at a computer company founded by some friends of mine (social networking advantage) and we managed to sell that successfully.   The current startup is much shakier, and at this point all the savings are gone, but I'm pretty sure the lack of a degree has not been holding me back.<p>Anyway, I'm all for Peter Thiel.  I wish something like this had been around for me.  It would have been great to have the feeling there was some approved alternative to college rather than just slogging through.",1292619436

2017718,story,,,1,1,Void_,"The Facebook Killer - fantasy?",,"Hi, I was thinking about Facebook, about why is it so successful and about what could possibly be even more successful. I would like to share these my ideas and I'm curious what do you people think about it.<p>Why is Facebook so successful. Why everyone wastes so much time on Facebook. Well, it's this whole social interaction idea - you go to Facebook because your friends are there. You get to comment on photos and statuses - it's basically like sitting in a pub talking.<p>But wait, when you're in a pub you're not doing anything productive, you're not studying, you're not working. And I think this is exactly why Facebook is so successful, it's because ""not doing anything productive"" is what we do most of the time. Maybe not you, maybe not me, but 99% of people just like to waste their time.<p>The only ""Facebook Killer"" idea that I have in my mind is something that would help you be productive. It's something that Facebook doesn't do. It's <i>exactly</i> what Facebook doesn't do.<p>I have this very particular need - to have a place just like Facebook, but where you wouldn't waste time, but you would get work done. (I'm a student so I mean working together on school problems.) I would like to have a place where all my friends would be and where we could come up with creative solutions to problems.<p>Well, there are already websites for this, right? I'm pretty sure there already are ""Productive Facebooks."" So if there are, how come there's no Productive Facebook with 500 million users? How come there's no Productive Facebook where all my friends are just like on the Facebook?<p>Well, the answer is most of the people don't want to be productive. There's no way a website that would help people work would be as successful as website that help people do nothing! That's why this Facebook killer could be never as successful as Facebook.<p>--<p>So my point. No way to kill Facebook.",1292619013

There was simply no way to justify dropping <i>that</i> much money on something that will have no financial benefit later.<p>Note: With enough weaseling and planning you <i>can</i> get some breadth in that engineering program, but the extreme academic load meant that you had to limit yourself to bird courses of some intellectual interest.

Think of the worst images of New York City from forty years ago. Think of the Charles Bronson vigilante movies from the 1970's.<p>- If you've been to a top school in the past few years you know that they've been involved in an arms race of building facilities. If you want to be a top university in this country you need to be able to attract the top faculty and students. You need the infrastructure. In NYC this is almost impossible given the cost of real estate and overcrowding. Columbia isn't doing this as a capricious act. It needs to expand if it is going to survive as a premier university. This isn't being done to build luxury dorms for rich undergrads. This is being done to provide new research and teaching facilities so that a two hundred fifty year old university can continue into the future.<p>- The businesses in question are the last in the area. Over the last ten years or so there has been a lot of back and forth between the university and its surrounding neighborhood. Some of it Columbia should be very embarrassed (perhaps even ashamed about) but after much squabbling the businesses in the article are the last holdouts. There is a lot being given back to the community by Columbia to make up for taking a larger part of the neighborhood. This includes cash payments, new schools, new community centers and housing for those displaced.<p>- The businesses in question were offered payment much in excess of what their properties are worth. The warehouse company was also offered a swap for real estate in a much more desirable location in the area. It agreed to the swap and then reneged on the deal.<p>The situation sucks but it's the world we live in. It's almost impossible for an institution to grow in the center of a major urban area. At the same time those institutions must grow if the urban area is to remain vibrant for its citizens going into the future. All things considered I think Columbia has been getting a raw deal in the condemnations like the one in the NY Post. It's easy pickings for the paper to rile up it's readers but in the end it only hurts the city as a whole.<p>I'm not part of Columbia but my wife is an alumni and my daughter is a current student there.",1292617970

He can write whatever he wants on his blog obviously, but keep that in mind. Comments on the site were also moderated preventing responses from some people.<p>It is not true that we only work with one carrier. We work with a variety of carriers to maximize our capabilities, geographic reach and redundancy.  Twilio works with most of the same carriers as Google Voice.<p>In regards to prank calling, <i>every</i> phone service is used for pranks, Tropo included. In our case, it's a byproduct of making it easy for any web developer to get started in minutes. However, we've put in place safeguards (most notably validating outgoing caller IDs before they can be used) to minimize these types of activities.<p>We pride ourselves on support. We monitor Twitter constantly, we have people in IRC all the time (set office hours is just a focused discussion topic), and we try to respond to emails and forum posts as fast as possible. We have a team of people scouring Stack Overflow, Hacker News and events all over the country helping developers with their questions, related to Twilio OR NOT. Go find any blog post written about Twilio and see how quickly we responded. We answer the phones when you call, though we have some area to improve in that regard. We're actively working on it.<p>We support developers like nobody else. We feature them on our site in our Gallery <a href=""http://www.twilio.com/gallery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twilio.com/gallery</a>, we tweet about them, we blog regularly about what our customers build, we have a weekly developer contest to reward cool new apps and we generally go to great lengths to help promote what developers and startups are building using Twilio. We exist to empower you. We'd much rather talk about the cool problems real working developers solving then toot our own horn.<p>Everyone here knows how good EC2 is, I don't think I need to defend that issue. It's working wonderfully for us. We don't have any capacity or other issues related to our infrastructure. On a more general capacity note, we have yet to hit a limit of what we can handle, and we've worked on some huge projects. Go look at our customer list. These companies would not work with us if we couldn't handle their demands: <a href=""http://www.twilio.com/gallery/customers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twilio.com/gallery/customers</a> These are just scratching the surface. There's another class of customer that's even bigger but doesn't like being talked about publicly.<p>We're hyper-focused on web developers. We (I'm a web dev myself) don't care about complicated telephony issues. We're too busy solving problems. Twilio works the way we work. Before I worked at Twilio I struggled trying to implement features that took me minutes once I discovered the Twilio API. It already spoke what I knew already and that's just simply HTTP.<p>We are not the right solution for every single developer; nothing is. But we have a rock solid solution that's working for over 20,000 developers and growing rapidly. If you're conflicted, try both services out for yourself. Don't listen to either company, just see for yourself which you like better. And if we can help in any way, we're listening.<p>If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to email me directly at jsheehan@twilio.com",1292616316

Heck, it is not much different if it is a trivial transform on the characters themselves. Anything that a person could easily do (making the thing convenient enough to actually use) is not going significantly alter the number of permutations. Of course, this is making a big assumption that a targeted attack will go after the paper rather than say, the keyboard (which is generally much less secure than a wallet.).<p>However, this being said, it is much more secure against untargeted attacks than the standard ""i have an algorithms in my head"" or ""i use the same password"" approach a lot of people use.",1292616227

From their About page on their fee:<p>> The fee is based on the formula (number of users * $0.001), so the earlier you join, the less you pay.<p>Bing's web cache shows the price being at (least, since we don't know when Bing took the cache) 6.87 yesterday (<a href=""http://cl.ly/0A1N0K0C2Q2W2H0U3h43"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/0A1N0K0C2Q2W2H0U3h43</a>) and now it is at 8.35. That is a difference of 1.48, indicating a gain of (at least) 1,480 customers. Every user x signing up past the point that the cache was taken generates (6.87 + 0.001x). Thanks to Gauss, we can find the total revenue using (6.87+8.35)(1480/2), and we can calculate roughly that Pinboard made something on the order of $11k yesterday, and probably a bit more since they probably round up instead of charging tenths of cents.

Previously, you would shut them down, take a backup, then restart them.<p>But to use that solution, both the database and the backup system have to be extended to support this, and to have it on a normal user system, every program would have to have a way to accept that kind of instruction from outside, and things like Evernote and FireFox haven't been designed with that in mind.<p>There could have been an easy way, except there wasn't one built in historically and now it's not easy to add one, so there isn't an easy way and wont be in the near future, even though it would be nice if there was.

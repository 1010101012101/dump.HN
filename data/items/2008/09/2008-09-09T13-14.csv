So that proves that there are women twittering, and more importantly, women in high-profile C-level jobs.<p>But looking again, there are 3 women in the list. So saying they can ONLY find males is a bit unfair.",1220968341

What if you could?<p>I know, there's pastie and we all love it. But pastie is unsociable. Hacker's are social beings, we love ""social networks"", so what I'm proposing is a social network pasties. A twitter for pastie, you follow your favorite hackers. You share code, you optimize code, you do pair programming ( the pastie way ).<p>Forget any web-based input methods. The way you share your code is through a command line program/script.( or any good methods that the community can come up with )<p>Does this sound fun to you? Want to get involved? Vote up if you think this is a good idea. Drop a comment if you got ideas or feedback to share!<p>Email me at hacksignal@gmail.com",1220968261

Mechanical Turk is an instantiation of that principle.<p>The money that's exchanged serves as a social signal from the world that your thumb-twiddling is inherently valuable. 
It's like Clay Shirky's essay on why micropayments don't work, only in reverse. Micropayments don't work because even a tiny payment has big psychological consequences: It sets off our decision-making circuits (""should I really pay for this?"") and our reciprocity circuits (""I paid for this, and it didn't make me happy, so you still owe me!""). The result is that we feel a micropayment as a consequential cost, even when the amount involved is tiny. Apply this in reverse and you get the Turk: Give someone a penny for a task and they feel rewarded, even though the reward is tiny.",1220967714

We have done the classification using CRM114 (thanks for this link which we were passed previously) but we're now looking to create a reliable, fast and robust crawler.  We have gone through Twisted and created something basic, but the question has been raised of what is out there already that has already been tested, ensures that it doesn't overloads sites, conforms to robots.txt and that can work across multiple servers?  We've looked at Pyro for the multiple server element (which looks fine) but we're struggling a little. I thought I'd ask here if anyone has any pointers for a great, compact Python crawler that we could use?<p>Thanks in advance<p>Neil",1220966105

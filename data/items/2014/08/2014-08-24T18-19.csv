I think most of us would like to take credit for our success, or if we have not been so fortunate, we hold out hope that we can be successful if we really want to and work hard enough for it. We&#x27;d like to believe that we are truly the masters of our fate. The protestant work ethic tells us that our sustained effort will be rewarded. This study suggests it may be more complicated than that, and perhaps we can&#x27;t take as much credit for our successes as we&#x27;d like. On the other hand, maybe we can beat ourselves up less for our failures and relax.",1408906686

8219315,comment,8215419,8217327,1,0,Houshalter,,,"That&#x27;s consistent with most of those studies. The next paragraph does an interesting experiment showing a very conservative rate of 3% per year:<p>>My specific target date is 2070, 60 years from now. As of 10 March 2011, gwern.net has around 6800 external links (with around 2200 to non-Wikipedia websites)4. Even at the lowest estimate of 3% annual linkrot, few will survive to 2070. If each link has a 97% chance of surviving each year, then the chance a link will be alive in 2070 is 0.972070−2011=0.16 (or to put it another way, an 84% chance any given link will die). The 95% confidence interval for such a binomial distribution says that of the 2200 non-Wikipedia links, ~336-394 will survive to 20705. If we try to predict using a more reasonable estimate of 50% linkrot, then an average of 0 links will survive (0.502070−2011×2200=1.735×10−16×2200≃0).

The synchronization problems and graphical glitches of X always made the Linux desktop feel second rate compared to Mac or Windows. With wayland, interactions with elements on the screen such as moving and resizing windows or dragging apps to the dash are perfectly in sync with the cursor. Not even Android has achieved this.<p>In addition, GNOME 3.14 is looking outstanding. With the latest design refinements, I find the interface significantly more attractive than OS X (before or after redesign).

(Most of the documentation emphasizes IOS, but speaking from experience, yes, you absolutely can make mac desktop and linux native binaries as well.)<p>What robovm can do is a great example of the joys of toolchains with a well-defined stable intermediate representation.  (Or one of the joys, I should say -- the flowering of languages on top of the jvm is another.)<p>Go&#x27;s first-class AST work is excellent stuff, but I&#x27;d love it even more if they fleshed out a well-defined, stable, portable intermediate format like LLVM&#x27;s IR and java&#x27;s bytecode.  Making a release of software and knowing it can run on architectures you haven&#x27;t even thought of yet is liberating.  Sure, architectures don&#x27;t come along &quot;very often&quot; (but they&#x27;re starting to happen more often!), and sure, you can use a full vm at the bottom layer (but it&#x27;s slow!  It can&#x27;t do a fraction of the optimizations possible with an IR/bytecode), and sure, you can just pretend the source is an IR (but if some library you use chooses a different build tool chain than you, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time -- don&#x27;t laugh, golang is too young to have bifurcated much yet, but give it time, and look at what happened around the go-get mess already; or, consider what happens when someone just adds <i>more</i> tooling like source generation, which has also already happened)... Taking the long view, I think an intermediate representation has proven incredibly useful for the jvm as a platform, and I hope golang also grows to offer such a route sometime in the future.<p>[1] <a href=""http://robovm.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robovm.com/</a>",1408905178

The fundamental problem seems to be three fold: first, as anyone not an idiot would expect, animals process alcohol differently so at best you have a model relating alcohol intake with alcohol present in the lungs.  Second, the programming appears to be ludicrously bad [1].  Pigs and manufacturers have fought and fought to avoid having to share code behind these devices or present any proof that they measure what they purport to measure besides, &quot;Trust me.&quot;  When competent engineers have finally gotten their hands on code, you&#x27;ll be unsurprised to discover it&#x27;s full of bugs.  Third, even accepting the bac to gas model arguendo, it&#x27;s an open question if these devices measure what they purport to measure.<p>Just a few representative issues when competent software engineers have got their hands on the code:<p><pre><code>   - Of the available 12-bits of A/D precision, just 4-bits (most-significant)\n   are used in the actual calculation. This sorts each raw blood-alcohol reading\n   into one of 16 buckets. (I wonder how they biased the rounding on that.)\n   - Out of range A/D readings are forced to the high or low limit. This must \n   happen with at least 32 consecutive readings before any flags are raised.\n   - There is no feedback mechanism for the software to ensure that actuated \n   devices, such as an air pump and infrared sensor, are actually on or off \n   when they are supposed to be.\n   - The software first averages the initial two readings. Then it averages the \n   third reading with that average. Then the fourth reading is averaged in, \n   etc. No comments or documentation explains the use of this formula, which \n   causes the final reading to have a weight of 0.5 in the final value and the \n   one before that to have a weight of 0.25, etc.\n   - Out of range averages are forced to the high or low limit too.\n   - Static analysis with lint produced over 19,000 warnings about the code \n   (that’s about three errors for ever five lines of source code).\n</code></pre>\nI would suggest we move to an impairment model of punishment rather than a blood alcohol.  Regardless, it&#x27;s a mockery of a justice system to have defendants convicted based on the flawed source code of a flawed model of human biology, that prosecutors have successfully loopholed their way into not having to defend, and that has essentially no publicly available evidence proving it measures what it purports to measure.<p>see also\n<a href=""http://digital.law.washington.edu/dspace-law/bitstream/handle/1773.1/1069/7WJLTA123.pdf?sequence=4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://digital.law.washington.edu/dspace-law/bitstream/handl...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://embeddedgurus.com/barr-code/2009/11/breathalyzer-source-code-analysis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://embeddedgurus.com/barr-code/2009/11/breathalyzer-sour...</a><p>edit: and just so we&#x27;re clear, drunk drivers are utter assholes.

8219193,comment,8217880,8218610,2,0,sanderjd,,,"Not to diminish the <i>difficulty</i> of accomplishing this, but there is a good answer to your question: it requires both a strong <i>culture</i> of quality assurance (this is what you&#x27;re talking about with mentors and watching each others&#x27; backs), and a strong <i>specialization</i> of quality assurance, made up of the experts. Unfortunately, many software organizations treat the specialization like a joke of a useless roadblock and only pay lip service to the culture. I think this may be because lots of software truly doesn&#x27;t need to be very high quality, while other software truly does, and determining which kind you&#x27;re making and justifying the additional cost of quality (which is enormous) is not straightforward.<p>In the case of this specific article, I find it odd that the blame is laid at the non-forensic-expert software engineers, rather than the companies that employ them, seemingly without the support of a tightly integrated set of experts. There is nothing wrong with dividing labor between creating software and defining and verifying what the software does. Both jobs are difficult in specialized ways. It seems that, in the opinion of one expert at least, these companies are just doing a poor job of QA.",1408903826

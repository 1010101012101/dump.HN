3308794,comment,3308398,3308398,1,0,AndyNemmity,,,"This is an excellent acquisition. SAP has been unable to deliver as well as they hoped on their ""on-demand"" promise, and this is a step towards that.<p>My belief is that they are purchasing SuccessFactors more for their experience with the cloud based delivery model, than for their actual software.<p>Which is a great thing I think. Instead of trying to homebrew a cloud which isn't your core business, you buy a group who that's their bread and butter, and you integrate them with your guys, and make a real SAP cloud (on demand) solution.<p>And if their software isn't terrible, that's icing on the cake. Perhaps there's something to take away there, I'm just not familiar with it.",1322945963

3308790,comment,3307948,3308281,2,0,verve,,,"We're debating the relative importance of connotations of entrepreneurship; there's, say, a discrete (maybe multivariate) probability distribution of connotations, dictionary definitions are supposed to capture its peaks, and the debate is over where the ""true"" peaks are. I doubt most people would call the subway vendor a Steve Jobsian entrepreneur. But if he hired others to sell for him, took out loans to increase his inventory, and attached Sodoku puzzles and small pencils to his candy to give bored passengers something to do, more people would likely agree he can be called an entrepreneur. Nevertheless, I believe a high bar for innovation is not an essential component of entrepreneurship -- and the more interesting entrepreneurs are not necessarily more innovative. So the subway vendor's living between the cracks, he's breaking the law. Maybe that makes him more interesting! What types of people tend to strike up conversations with him? How often do policemen confront him? Which foods are more popular after a Yankees game? Interesting entrepreneurs may be engaged in very ordinary activities that afford them unique perspectives.<p>Incidentally, I love the NY subway for all its various distractions -- the breakdancers, the flashmobbers, and yes, even the panhandlers, because it's always interesting to observe how passengers react to them.",1322945916

3308782,comment,3305870,3306162,4,0,firebones,,,"Taking Stanford's Machine Learning course this fall has given me a couple of new analogies to explain the innovator's dilemma. Think of business strategy as the learning hypothesis, and the learning algorithm seeks to increase profits by minimizing the error between what value they capture and the available dollars in the market.  Successful companies walk the surface, making stepwise reductions in this error rate. This often leads to a perfectly rational descent to a local optima.  These local optima can be very deep and very profitable, which makes it even more difficult to turn attention to steps that will introduce loss and variance in order to find a more profitable (or global) optima.<p>""Randomizing"" the starting points (the effect of hundreds of startups in a market) can increase the likelihood of a better optima being found, as can large companies attempting the same with lots of small bets (e.g., 20% time) which then are cultivated using the proven learning algorithm (i.e., management approach.)<p>True visionaries are able to hasten the process by scouting out where these new optima are likely to reside.",1322945672

CS can teach a lot about critical thinking, in a way that few subjects can. Programming is a very effective way to test hypotheses and cut through the BS.<p>If I was to give a list for ""critical thinking enhancing courses"", I'd also put History and Math up there (also language stuff, spelling and grammar, but as a prerequisite).<p>So, would literary criticism make the list? I'd say, yes, we need some form of art criticism to enhance a blind spot the other subjects leave to our critical thinking --i.e thinking about things that cannot be reasoned in a 1+1=2 way.<p>Now, Chemistry, Physics, Biology and the rest, I find secondary in regards to critical thinking.<p>For example, learning about evolution is not ""critical thinking"" itself.<p>That would be learning to argue WHY evolution is more plausible or learning how to find faults in ""intelligent design"".

It's only been just over a month so far, so I don't yet have the insight that this article provides.  But I do have a few comments.<p>It seems that his work with foursquare, is that most of the team is local, and he is remote.  I think the dynamic changes if the entire company is remote, there is less 'water cooler talk' that you miss out on, because you all have to make sure to communicate in the same way equally.<p>Overall I've so far found it much more relaxing.  I can work how I want, have far fewer meetings (as things are better spec'ed out).  We do meet up in person to go through larger more conceptual things.  We also make sure to document well, ticket well, and as 37signals says, we're all expected to be managers of one.<p>I've worked with a lot of people that I don't think would be able to keep themselves motivated, but if you're someone with a lot of drive, it'll probably be much better than working in an office*<p>* I think it's much better only if you have things spec'ed out, have clear leaders, etc.  Without that getting community consensus, and large discussions would be a nightmare remote.",1322945445

By going public you run this risk. But doing the search in private (or as they say ""quietly shopping"") you avoid some (but not all) of the risk. If nothing materializes you can go public later.<p>""you're competing with other resumes""<p>Very true. One of the best ways to not be compared is to approach things in a way that there is no competition. Approach employers when they are not advertising. I did this once and got a job that in no way I was qualified for resume wise.  Once a job is advertised or with a headhunter you're being compared to someone else. (Same with dating most of us would rather not have to compete head to head with 20 other people and hope to be chosen the best of the lot.)",1322944615

These were criticized as being less cost-effective than simply buying game points, and in some cases, being outright scams that would download unwanted software or unwittingly sign up for a recurring subscription.[38] One ad signed up players for subscriptions to expensive and unwanted text-messaging services.[39]<p>On October 31, 2009, Michael Arrington of TechCrunch said that Zynga intentionally worked with scam advertisers, and that lead generation made up a third of Zynga's revenue.[64] Arrington also alleged that Facebook was complicit in this.[65] On November 2, 2009, CEO Mark Pincus announced a reform in its offers: Tatto Media, a major offer provider that enrolled users into recurring cell phone subscriptions, would be banned, all mobile offers would be removed, and offer providers would be required to pre-screen offers.[66]<p>Arrington continued to question Pincus' role in the scams, republishing a video of a speech by Pincus.[67] In the speech, Pincus said:<p>""So I funded [Zynga] myself but I did every horrible thing in the book to, just to get revenues right away. I mean we gave our users poker chips if they downloaded this Zwinky toolbar which was like, I don't know, I downloaded it once and couldnt get rid of it. <i>laughs</i> We did anything possible just to just get revenues so that we could grow and be a real business."" Mark Pincus, Speech from Startup@Berkeley<p>In response, Pincus noted that after offering the Zwinky toolbar, his team of ten decided to remove it since it was a ""painful experience"".[68]<p>Several days after the Techcrunch story, Zynga's most recent Facebook game FishVille, was temporarily taken offline by Facebook on claim of advertising violations. According to Zynga, Fishville had 875,000 users within two days of launch. A release from Facebook on its reasons for taking the game offline read that ""FishVille will remain suspended until Facebook is satisfied that Zynga demonstrates compliance with Facebook restrictions  as well as Zyngas own restrictions  on the ads it offers users.""[69] FishVille was later un-suspended at midnight November 910.[70]<p>Several suits were filed against Zynga for promoting such offers,[71][72] including the class-action lawsuit Swift v. Zynga in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California for violation of the Unfair competition law and the Consumers Legal Remedies Act, after the lead plaintiff's credit card was billed more than $200 for offers she completed to receive YoVille currency.[73][74][75]<p>Pincus later said that he had been too eager to increase company revenues through advertising, and that operating in reactive mode by taking down ads only after receiving complaints had not worked. The company removed all ads for a time, relying only on direct purchase of game currency, then began reintroducing third party ads only after they had been screened.[38]",1322944306

Bill Lee, down at the bottom of the article, says that he's started avoiding very early financing rounds, which doesn't sound particularly alarming.<p>I'm going to chalk this one up to a journalist taking some creative liberties.",1322943637

Right now, people dont seem to care about privacy all that much, and I can't blame them.
Every time the privacy debate comes up in relation to google or facebook the conversation is steered towards the following assumptions:<p><pre><code>  - The attacker is another member of the website or an anonymous web user.
  - The platform (gmail or facebook) is a trusted third party.
</code></pre>
This is not the debate I want to be having. I don't agree with the second assumption. Any privacy policy I can fill out for my data will not prevent the company from accessing my data. They own the database and the file servers and even have authority over my login credentials for that website.<p>What about the privacy in the following paradigm:<p><pre><code>   - The attacker can be any person or company on the internet.
   - Your server is a VM in a distributed platform of hosts.
   - You have a special credential (id-rsa), which is used to change settings on the VM.  
   - Host can be trusted most of the time, but sometimes (prob=0.2) they are malicious.

</code></pre>
If we ensure there is a big ecosystem of hosting companies with a compatible API, then individual users could constantly migrate their hosting plans and change companies every month, or even every week. Thus in the worst case, a ""cloud host"" could eavesdrop on you just for one week. If you constantly change hosts, you will get a guaranteed 80% privacy, which is much better than 0% privacy.<p>Anyone who has lots of servers on their hands and wants to start a hosting company -- I say you get the whole ""my home in the cloud"" app hosting business started:

At the risk of being downvoted, just wanted to add my 2 cents: seems obvious to me that Google&#x27;s PR team has been in full motion on Go lately. At the very least, there are quite a few  Google fans active on HN routinely pushing Go.  Which is no problem of course.<p>I just find this somewhat frustrating given that we also have the massive NSA surveillance scandal unfolding.  Because I&#x27;d like to think that intelligent, free-thinking hackers would opt for using products & technologies from companies & organizations not so directly, deeply, and intricately involved in said scandal.<p>Anyway, kudos to Dan for his detailed article - I&#x27;m sure he could care less about the political alignment of the corporation he is getting his tools from - and really it should be about technology first; so if Golang fits his needs most optimally then by all means that&#x27;s what he should be using.

6234203,comment,6232573,6232573,1,0,dojomouse,,,"The capacity constraint accusation on the grounds of spacing and max G is pretty bogus. Firstly, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with running at far more than 0.5g in an emergency. You think a plane stays below 0.5g when it crash lands? You just have to make sure people aren&#x27;t badly injured, not pamper them - and make sure such emergencies are very rare.<p>Where the author really gets it wrong though is in saying &quot;Maybe he can resolve that by using larger pods. But of course, a larger pod will weigh more. And that will probably mean using stronger steel for the tubes, which means that the cost will go up&quot;.\nThat would be true, but if you&#x27;re happy to resolve the issue with larger pods then you should be equally happy to resolve it with groups of smaller pods travelling at smaller separations. A 737-800 seats around 150 people. Hyperloop passenger capsules seat 30. So no one should have any conceptual issue with running 5 hyperloop capsules in convoy with separation of a couple of seconds. This &#x27;couple of seconds&#x27; still means almost 1km, so they&#x27;re certainly not sharing the same segments of tube, so you don&#x27;t need to scale the tube design at all. It&#x27;s still dirt cheap, and you have plenty of capacity, and it&#x27;s still MUCH safer than a plane because if one capsule has a fault the others following can still likely stop in time (given they&#x27;re all decelerating at roughly the same speed).",1376859398

It is interesting that m1 hasn&#x27;t commented on any submissions in months, and this submission is one of only two in his history. If he&#x27;s been active recently, he&#x27;s only been lurking. Of course, it shouldn&#x27;t matter how old the user is or what their activity history looks like, so long as the submission isn&#x27;t spam. The deaded submission clearly isn&#x27;t spam and cransa&#x27;s comments aren&#x27;t spammy either (and that dead link is his only submission to boot), but this isn&#x27;t the first time the mods have decided to give preference to links submitted by older users (edit: as well giving preference to other users with no discernible rationale for doing so). As well, in my own observations, it appears that there is a upvote/comment threshold that once crossed means the rising submission is liable to get killed. That is, if a rising submission has ~10-20 upvotes but no comments, it seems at greater risk of being deaded. And of course there&#x27;s the auto-hellban for new users that decide to jump into active discussions, regardless of their comments&#x27; content.

6234187,comment,6231382,6232206,1,0,mikegagnon,,,"> &quot;Money doesn&#x27;t come only from taxes, it can also come from printing.&quot;<p>If the government printed money and gave it directly to the impoverished it would be equivalent to a tax on everyone else (and the wealthy would experience the largest absolute wealth loss).<p>Money is only useful in so much that it represents a fraction of the total money supply. It represents a kind of point system for the distribution of wealth. I might own one trillionth of the total money supply, whereas a more wealthy person might one one millionth of the money supply.<p>Thus, when you print money it reduces everyone&#x27;s wealth (except for the new money holder). So let&#x27;s say today there is $1 trillion in the money supply, and I (the government) print another trillion and give it directly to the impoverished. The value of every dollar has just been halved. So every millionaire has essentially become a half millionaire.<p>So yes, if you printed $1 trillion and gave it to the impoverished it would be equivalent to a tax on everyone else (and the wealthy would experience the largest absolute wealth loss).<p>However, in today&#x27;s banking system newly created money disproportionately ends up in the hands of the wealthier. In this way, creating money (today) is a tax on the impoverished and the lower earners in society.

Yet at the same time, these improvements tend to yield more flexibility and capability, potentially providing additional features (sometimes entirely by chance). I find that in these such cases, it actually becomes easier to reason about what your code does, because you have come to a point where you can clearly generalize about your software.<p>On the flip-side, I can also greatly empathize with the author, as even in my attempts to generalize the functionality of software, there often exist ugly one-off bits of critical business logic that invariably dirty the water. In these such situations, it seems to become harder and more complex to build generic code, and you are much better off just sticking to the straightforward implementation without allowing for any of the bells-n-whistles that a more generalized approach might offer.<p>TL;DR--It really depends on the situation, in my opinion, but this shouldn&#x27;t prevent you from trying to find a generic solution that is less complex yet offers more.",1376857773

If that mechanism ceases to operate, they will likely become poor by spending all their money.<p>> Probably they think so because they have an unconscious and implicit belief that the currently existing mechanisms of distribution are somehow &quot;natural&quot;. Frankly, that is a bizarre proposition.<p>That strikes me as an un-natural way of looking at things. If a farmer grows potatoes and sells them for money, he&#x27;s not &quot;receiving&quot; money, he&#x27;s trading for it (he&#x27;s receiving money as much as the other guy is &quot;receiving&quot; potatoes&quot;). That seems very natural to me (you give something, you get something).\nEven in situations where this trade is illegal, it still happens; for example, drug dealers. They sell you heroin/cocaine/marijuana, you give them money. That transaction is highly illegal, yet it still happens because addicts want drugs and dealers want money (that they then use to buy other stuff with).\nOn the other side of the spectrum, you have the completely legal and moral transactions, like the potato example I gave. Laws have some impact on the basic natural tendency of people to trade for what they need, but they can&#x27;t make trade go away (look at alcohol prohibition for another example).<p>I think the main cause of poverty is that poor people don&#x27;t have much to trade (skills, labor, resources, even ideas or art). In other situations, trade is simply made difficult (for example, if you live in a warzone, it&#x27;s pretty hard to be a hairdresser or grow potatoes).",1376857196

This style of reasoning seems to me to be common in political arguments. The reality is is that there are trade offs from policy choice in the present, which are hard enough to quantify. Then there are going to be future trade offs, which become harder and harder to predict the further out they are, and the more complex the problem domain is.<p>The core of his argument is that special andpurpose computers open the potential for surveillance. This seems myopic in the sense that the only effective controls on government surveillance are political. General purpose computers or not, the government has no shortage of means to spy.<p>So far, the adoption of special purpose computers is being driven by market forces. They simply work better for most tasks than general purpose computers. There is a huge benefit to the human population from these devices, just as there is a huge benefit from having a rather leaky worldwide\nnetwork easily accessible to &quot;civilians.&quot;<p>So society has to struggle already with how to manage control of information. The availability of general purpose computers seems largely peripheral to this dilemma.<p>As far as the availability of general purpose computers to technical people, the harm he posits is almost entirely hypothetical. Not only are they still being produced in large numbers, there are fantastic numbers of existing computers that will continue to function for years to come.<p>A far more likely impediment to accessibility to powerful, modern general purpose computers will be that market forces will shift so that they are no longer commodity items, and the cost to access the latest and greatest will rise. This is a problem of market structure, and legislative attempts to address this type of pricing problem have proven to be futile.<p>If we were seeing calls by industry or politicians to legally limit the use of open source operating systems, then I think a call of alarm would ring louder (at least to me).",1376856461

That said, I typed &quot;definition of cure&quot; into google and the response humorously was the exact opposite of the claimed definition, &quot;Verb Relieve (a person or animal) of the symptoms of a disease or condition&quot; solely focused around relieving symptoms, not total scientific analysis of the entire situation or root cause analysis or any of that much more complicated stuff.<p>Its OK to have a near religious belief in unusual definitions; its just useless when trying to talk to the general public, especially if they operate under the logical opposite of your personal definition.

The Hamiltonian (that is to say, the energy) consists only of a kinetic energy plus an interaction between the spin up and spin down particles on the same site (e.g. if I have two spin up bosons and four spin down bosons, the interaction contribution to the energy is 8 U, where U is a constant parameter---the strength of the interaction.) Depending on this interaction strength U, the system might behave either like a conductor or an insulator.<p>The problem is hard to deal with analytically (for reasons I can&#x27;t say I understand) and, as I understand it, the space of possible states is so huge that the numerics become computationally intractible at about a lattice 5 sites x 5 sites x 5 sites.

For the size of a phone, we&#x27;re talking more like 0.10mW, which is about 10,000 times less than a typical phone needs (assuming it was charging 24/7 with 100% efficiency).<p>Although, the answer gives the formula as 100kW/(4 * pi * r^2), which seems to give 0.80 W/m^2 instead of 80 W/m^2, so perhaps divide my other answers by 100 (and make that 1 million times lower than the power necessary to power a phone)<p>EDIT: I previously stated the formula gave the wrong units which was a mistake.",1376856076

Last I checked, people aren&#x27;t squeamish about going all the way down to san mateo to get to SFO.  OK.  So let&#x27;s say it takes about the same time as HSR (keeping in mind that in the real world &quot;existing lines&quot; are not rated for High speed, and are subject to congestion problems with existing commercial and freight routes)...  The pricepoint for hyperloop is about the same as an airplane, which is half as expensive as rail travel.  So, you could either take hyperloop or take HSR.  The times are the same (assuming no express routes crop up to get to hyperloop), but you do still have to take <i>some</i> public transport or cab or whatever, is it worth it to pay half as much?  I think so.",1376856075

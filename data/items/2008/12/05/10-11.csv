386874,comment,386365,386365,0,0,sachinag,,,"Yokum, I would recommend that you re-order the category headers in the top to make it more linear for the various stages of a startup: Incorporation and Founders to the left of Series A and Down Rounds, as examples.  It would be helpful for me when I recommend your site to others (which I do constantly).<p>Also, I'd also recommend that you add something about ""how to hire me/WSGR to incorporate/represent your company"" in the FAQs or Contact Yokum sections.  This is not obvious, and picking up the phone and calling a partner at Wilson is scary.  Some semblence of the process and ballpark fees would be very helpful.  As you say, an experienced attorney is no comparison to one of those online legal form mills - and people would be surprised to know how affordable quality advice actually is.  Of course, if you're not interested in new business, I understand.  :)",1228473972
386873,comment,385392,386577,0,0,Tichy,,,"I am all for helping people. I am just not sure who could be trusted - I don't necessarily trust the government to make the best choices for the people. And in this crisis, there is too much scapegoating going on for my taste. And calling for regulations seems to be an extension of that.<p>If you call for regulations, first tell me why the market failed to regulate itself (that is weed out the crooks, if the crooks are to blame)?<p>If you are calling for more transparency, maybe I can go with you. But I don't think complex rulesets about who should give credit and who should be allowed to get credit are the way to go forward.<p>I don't want to claim to understand what pg wrote, but my understanding would be he wrote among other things about something exactly like that: more regulations means it becomes more costly to give somebody credit. Therefore there will be less firms giving credit, and ""smaller people"" will have more problems getting credit because they are not worth the bother. In the end there will be a monopoly of a few big firms who handle credit.<p>Also, what if housing prices really would have risen forever, and regulations would have prevented people from gaining from it? Who is to say in advance what course of action is right? Or would you say everybody who took out a mortgage was a crook?",1228473692

386871,comment,384637,385284,0,0,timr,,,"<i>""Can you provide some examples of how you might write ""non-imperative"" programs in a mainstream object-oriented language?""</i><p>Go back and read my post -- I drew a distinction between ""mainstream"" OO languages, and pure OO languages.  If you want to genuinely understand object-oriented programming, don't look at C++ or Java.  Look at Smalltalk or Simula.<p><i>""A functional program is not a ""sequence of steps""; in principle, it is just a mathematical expression that can be evaluated (via some means) to yield a value (think of a SQL query or a Prolog program).""</i><p>I know what you're arguing -- the platonic ideal of the functional program is stateless, and methods within that program have no side effects.  In reality, all programs store state <i>somewhere</i>, and even ""pure"" functional languages store state (albeit at a higher level).<p>What I'm trying to explain is that object-oriented programming doesn't <i>require</i> side effects.  Where functional programs use closures and monads to pass state around, you could just as easily use a functor to do the same thing.  Thus, you aren't compelled to write object-oriented code in an imperative style.  The difference is that OO code tends to be more explicit about the location of state variables, and calls them what they are.  Functional programs, in contrast, just tuck the stateful bits into closures, and pretends that they aren't really state.",1228473546

You say that raising IQ will improve quality of life, but you don't want to do that right now because it's more important to first raise quality of life.<p>Hu?<p>Yes I changed what you wrote. But that's what what you wrote means. You can not keep people alive without simultaneously increasing their quality of life.<p>That should be obvious: people who can't stay alive are extinct in a generation. People who die after having kids would benefit from increase in quality of life, which pretty much means living longer.",1228472397

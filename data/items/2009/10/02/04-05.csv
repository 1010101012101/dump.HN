At worst, you'll get a disingenuous canned response from someone trying to game the interview and frame the chosen scenario as ""success"".<p>A better phrasing would be:<p>""Please tell me about a project experience when a plan, scenario, or design didn't unfold as originally intended.""<p>The candidate can frame their response as ""success"", ""failure"", ""improvisation"", etc. and this opens up avenues to explore their thought processes, strategy, and 'leadership style' when responding to novel scenarios.  This is also an opportunity to weigh the candidate's level of disclosure and frank communications as to what sorts of value judgments they, themselves, apply to the chosen scenario and their qualitative reactions to it.",1254459483

I fail to see how it's an improvement to have to wear less comfortable clothes than you'd like, and have to be there when your body really doesn't want to be. My company went back to a minimal dress code after a year of ""business casual"", yet somehow we still do our jobs and as a result I'm much more inclined to stay longer when it's needed. And we've always had flexible hours; if I had to be in at 9 I'd be useless for the morning and would be gone before my most productive time in the evening.<p><i>At Startup B, it works like this: Investor X identifies a need, Investor Y disagrees on implementation, 95% of time is spent discussing exact wording instead of the usefulness of said feature.

Dr. Norvig takes the term ""AI"" to also encompass ""machine learning"" in the sense of developing algorithms that learn within limited problem domains.

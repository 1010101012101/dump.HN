The odds of the actual event occuring don't improve every year that goes by. That's assumes everything is static and unstoppable to begin with, among other false assumptions embedded into it.<p>It'd be like saying: given enough time, a nuclear bomb will go off in Greenland. That's not true at all, but if you calculated using Buffett's false premise, then yes, after N years it would have to happen (because his premise is that there's N chance per year, and then he treats the equation like a coin flip, where eventually it is supposed to be 99.99999% likely to land on heads, but that's false because every flip is independent of the last flip in reality; his calculation only works in an artificial reality / vacuum). In actuality, a nuclear attack could just as easily occur tomorrow morning as 80 years from now, and that completely debunks Buffett's point.",1370581174

5837281,comment,5836501,5836501,13,0,dragonwriter,,,"These are all denials of things around the periphery of the PRISM issue like inferred details of the mechanisms by which the data is gathered, and none of them are denials of the core of what supposedly is happening under PRISM in terms of the scope of user data that has been collected by the NSA.<p>If you look at the ""denials"", they all only deny one or more of the following things:\n1. That the government has direct access to the providers systems,\n2. That customer information is provided to the government outside of what the provider believes is legally required,\n3. That customer information is turned over to the government without a court order.<p>Lets start with the ""direct access"" piece, because this appears to be a common inference as to how the broad scope of information at issue is provided to the government, but the ""direct access"" characterization seems to be at odds with the slide titled ""PRISM Collection Details"" in the presentation that is the source of the accusations. That slide strongly suggests that there is a distinct <i>collection</i> of data that is available for NSA users, varying in content by provider.<p>The idea that it is a ""voluntary program"" or one outside of a process dependent on court orders isn't inconsistent with anything that has been made public from the source documents, but it doesn't seem to be demanded by them, either. What is clear from the documents (assuming their authenticity and accuracy) and the direct characterizations of them (rather than what are clearly inferences and not direct characterizations) provided in the coverage is that different providers were brought into the program at different times, and that the program involves some form of ""cooperation"" by the providers -- but none of that implies that it is voluntary or doesn't involve court orders of some kind (perhaps, specifically, FISA warrants)-- and that from each provider the collection of data is limited to a provider-specific list of particular kinds of data, and that the data is provided to the NSA directly from the companies servers (but the ""direct access"" rather than direct provision thing appears to be an inference from the direct provision, rather than itself a direct characterization.)<p>In fact, the recently revealed broad Verizon FISA warrant suggests exactly how this could have been achieved with FISA warrants -- instead of being dates on which a negotiated agreement was reached with each provider, the dates the providers are listed as being brought into the program could be the dates on which a broad FISA warrant (similar to the Verizon one, but specifying different data) was issued mandating collection of specified data from the specified provider. The providers could then <i>honestly</i> deny participation in a voluntary program, or providing direct access to their servers, or providing customer information without a court order -- they could even honestly <i>not</i> know that the FISA warrant they were served was part of a broader program directed at wide range of providers. Such a warrant could specify directly (or make timeliness requirements that make this the only way to comply) that the data be provided by being <i>fed</i> to the NSA from the companies servers, without providing the NSA <i>access</i> to the servers.<p>IOW, <i>every</i> <i>word</i> of the denials could be literally true, with the substance of the story -- that the NSA is being fed the vast array of customer data described in the stories about PRISM and can access data from that collection freely at will -- being true at the same time, the only things that are in conflict between the story and the denials are peripheral inferences and implications about the mechanism that appear in the story (such as ""direct access"" or the absence of court orders or other compulsory process.)",1370580405
5837280,comment,5836193,5836193,5,0,andrewfong,,,"One way of interpreting his comments: We suck up all the data and then apply filters to remove domestic information. Although the NSA has access to information on the American people, it does not specifically target Americans and discards purely domestic information. As such, it is not ""spying on the American people"" so much as inflicting collateral damage on the privacy of the American people.<p>To a certain extent, this is understandable. The NSA may not trust Verizon's judgment on who a foreign national is. And the nature of a more specific request may reveal classified information -- e.g. if the NSA asked for ""all calls to Libya"" just prior to the bombing campaign, that may have revealed something was up.<p>That's not to say any of this is justified, or that the attempts to filter out domestic information are effective.

I went to a top-tier undergrad, and got a job as an associate consultant at a strategy firm directly out of college. And guess what? It was terrible.

Cultivate curiosity!<p>That being said, the software industry has a bit of a fetish for giving these problems in interviews, even though they're rarely used in your job, and there's little evidence that performance on these problems is the best way to evaluate candidates.<p>If you want to be a smart-ass after the interview, study up on Bayes' Law, and lecture your interviewer about it. I.e., p(good programmer|pass interview puzzles) != p(pass interview puzzles|good programmer). If you hire someone because they did well on these problems, you later have data on how well they do at the company. However, you will <i>lack</i> data on how well someone does at the company if they <i>don't</i> do well on the problems (it could be they do just as well), so you have no evidence it's good at classifying candidates.<p>In particular, while I think interview problems are reasonably correlated with talent, I'm not convinced that they're a higher quality source of information than things like whiteboard exercises, real coding exercises, and code samples. It's also biased by things like recency (was your algorithms class last year?) and cramming (be sure to go through Cracking the Coding Interview exercises).",1370579868

Just rip it to shreds instead!):<p>The fear of losing privacy to the government is based on the fear that this increased surveillance will be used by the government to smother dissent. This is a valid fear, but has the government yet used surveillance to smother dissent? If you can find a solid example of this, I'd like to see one (and for all I know, there could be many, I'm genuinely interested).<p>Until the government has been caught using surveillance to stifle dissent, it seems like increased surveillance only serves to reduce crime. Of course, there are illegal things that, in my opinion, should be legal, but this is a reason to petition the government for change, not break the law... perhaps a reduced ability to break pointless laws would galvanize the population into large-scale activism?<p>Fear of government surveillance is entirely fear of smothered dissent. We must make sure our fears of the latter are logically sound before we fear the former.<p>EDIT: Because I love arguing with myself, I'll point out that it's possible some wrongly illegal activities may be embarrassing for some individuals, and they would be hesitant to openly campaign for them. It still feels weird to argue for privacy on the grounds that people have a right to get away with certain things, hmm...<p>EDIT 2: 15 minutes and already COINTELPRO negated the argument.

It's filled with commentary telling you <i>exactly</i> how to interpret what you're seeing. You're told that this guy on the video is <i>clearly</i> carrying around a camera. You're told that, sure, some of these guys were carrying around rifles, but they were just calmly hanging around. You're shown a quote from the military saying that they did not deliberately civilians, then shown images of a van with big arrows pointing at it labeled ""CHILDREN."" The entire thing is presented with the clear implication that these were deliberate killings of innocent people.<p>The actual context of that video? A mechanized infantry unit in the area was taking fire from unknown sources and the Apache was there to provide air cover. The Apache gunner is sitting in a helicopter being buffeted in the air while peering through a 5""x5"" monochrome display -- something roughly the size of two iPhones sitting side by side -- and sees a large group of men obviously armed with rifles nearby. He sees a large cylindrical object and calls RPG because large groups of armed men in a war zone with active shooting going on are more likely to be carrying around an RPG than a Nikon. He opens fire on them.<p>The <i>result</i> is the same: a bunch of people died absolutely needlessly and tragically. It never should have happened.<p>But in one context, you're telling people that the military is going around deliberately killing innocent people for no reason. In the other context, people are dying <i>despite</i> the best intentions of the troops involved because war is a messy, confusing, and terrible thing.<p>Presenting it in one context is just going to turn off anyone who -- rightly -- thinks you're just trying to sell an agenda. The other just might get people realizing that war is something to be avoided because there's no such thing as a clean war.",1370578545

Believe it or not, East Germany wasn't all downsides. People were employed, general crime was apparently quite low, children felt relatively safe, children were given education (though indoctrination was certainly a heavy component), they were clothed and fed.

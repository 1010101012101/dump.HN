The 'books that changed your world' feels like a dumping-ground for recent UK bestsellers that'll be forgotten in 50 years (Schott's miscellany; Eats, shoots and leaves; A child called 'it'), but most of the rest are bona fide classics. Better, many of them are classics that are still fun to read.",1207601687

As you note, IPO is much less likely than in the past, due to the regulatory environment and tanking stock market.  But, it's still early yet.  I wouldn't rule out an IPO from a YC company or two in the next three years.",1207601541

If you work through all the exercises you'll ""know"" perl well enough for doing most things. Also helpful is the Perl Cookbook. Contrary to other advice, I didn't find Programming Perl (the camel book) as valuable as Learning Perl.<p>You could learn via web and man pages but perl is weird enough so that the Learning Perl workout is valuable.",1207601356

157183,comment,156928,156928,0,0,benreesman,,,"I work in a company that writes almost everything in Perl, and as a result I have personally written tens of thousands of lines of the stuff, and I maintain and debug several times that amount. This code is used for everything from serving web pages to interacting with carrier SMS-C to number crunching. So believe me, Perl is definitely the devil I know.<p>That being said, the only advice I can offer you is unsolicited: don't learn Perl. Perl is a very powerful language in a lot of ways and in its day it was the only game in town for serious rapid development. It is fundamentally broken in a lot of ways though, and unlearning the brain damage that you will get from becoming a Perl expert could take a very long time (it has taken me years). I won't launch into a diatribe about these language characteristics unless you ask me to, but do not doubt that I could.<p>People talk a lot about how great CPAN is, and it does have a certain charm, but it is ultimately more trouble than it is worth. There are CPAN modules for everything, but just as often as not they are flawed or buggy or too limited and you don't realize this until you've sunk a considerable amount of time into the problem. Just the other day a colleague wasted an afternoon trying to get LWP::Parallel to work as advertised before realizing that it could not be done.<p>Perl is great for building prototypes, but when you go to deploy the stuff you realize that DBI fundamentally can't do connection pooling in the way you want, and mod_perl has an execution lifecycle that can only be described as 'whacky' (depending on how you include your handler modules, sometimes mod_perl will simply stop evaluating your module when it reaches an error, leaving your symbol table partially filled in with no error warning), and once you've used a couple of CPAN modules they'll all invite their friends and those friends will invite their friends and pretty soon your Apache children are using 15-50 megabytes of _unshared_ memory each. Yeah that's right, the interpreter goes and touches a bunch of pages of Perl 'code' post-fork and blows the COW and now all your RAM is belong to mod_perl. It's really cool when an 8-way Xeon server with 16GB of RAM can only handle a couple of hundred req/s before it starts faulting and crashing Apache children on malloc.<p>Do yourself a favor and use Ruby instead. Ruby is so much like Perl that you can almost call it a dialect, but just not quite as broken. Pretty broken still, but not nearly so broken as Perl. It has all of Perl's good characteristics and only most of its bad ones. And if the availability of libraries, or the lack of decent threading or other deployment characteristics bother you, then use JRuby which is now basically the fastest production Ruby and can call into all of the Java libraries (which _can_ do connection pooling in the way that you want). Personally I prefer Common Lisp and Rhino but you can't go too wrong with JRuby.<p>If you go the Perl route you will definitely come to regret it.",1207601268

To me, it is disgustingly criminal.</i><p>Leaving those children hanging out to dry would be what I'd consider disgustingly criminal.  I'm not sure I can get my bile to rise to that level for helping them.<p>Being taxed to help children is about the <i>last</i> thing I'd fight against, as a matter of priority.  First I'd go after the actual <i>wasting</i> of tax dollars, which helping children certainly is not.  In fact, it's essential if you care about society even from a _self-interested_ standpoint.<p>It's similar to health insurance.  Is it ""fair"" that if you don't need to use it, you end up paying for other people who aren't so fortunate?  If you live long enough, the probability approaches 1 that you'll need it.  And it may cover more in hospital bills for you than you paid into the system.<p>I think the essential basis of your objection is that life is a competition and that if you're winning, you should be able to press your advantage instead of having your lead reduced by outside interference.<p>By contrast, those of us in the ""cooperation"" camp think instead of fighting over who gets the bigger piece of a smaller pie, we can make the whole pie bigger.  And taking a broader view, even eliminate competition altogether by providing computational resources to each individual that will maximize hir experience of life (via completely convincing VR), given what our limited brains are even capable of and how it pales in comparison to the possibilities of nonbiological intelligence.",1207601028

Inheritance seems to rely on a platonic ideal, i.e. there is some universal sense of chair (parent class) from which office chair, rocking chair inherit.<p>In reality that's not how we think about chairs. We can imagine the first chair was a tree stump which was incrementally refined, eventually into office chair, rocking chair, etc.<p>When we wish to add heated chairs to our application we can simply add a heating element to our chair prototype. We can even have heated office chairs, heated rocking chairs which use the same heating element prototype. Much more flexible.",1207601000

157160,comment,156942,156942,0,0,CRASCH,,,"I think what you are trying to say when you say ""Why aren't there more open source web applications?"" is something like ""Why aren't there more web application sites that provide a service that are open source?""<p>This I think is pretty simple. If I got your question right. If you are building a new site that does rss feeds aggregation with dynamic custom filters that track your web surfing to automatically rate content based on pages you spent time on, for example. Wow that was a mouthful. Err. Forget that. If you are building a better reddit.You have some new idea and that is your competitive edge and reason for doing the work. If you open source that you just gave away your reason for building your site.<p>So there is a conscious decision to either build a site and try to monetize it, or build an open source platform and gain traction. The difference here is what you are trying to accomplish. If you are trying to differentiate a site with new technology or features you don't want to give away the secret sauce (source) to your incumbent competitors or your future competitors. While your busy focusing on and perfecting the technology. They can be busy focusing on getting to market.<p>If google or ebay had open sourced their technology how hard would it be for Microsoft or Amazon to clone it and take it to the next level? If we use google as an example here. If microsoft could see exactly how page rank worked and the architecture that allows google to scale. Could they create their own version and possibly improve it. I think they could. If google open sourced in the beginning super live search would have happened before google got their ridiculous market share and google may not even exist today...",1207599757

10670270,comment,10669891,10670111,0,0,DrJokepu,,,"I have worked extensively with both Swift and Go. The currently available Swift implementation in Xcode is fairly closely tied to Cocoa (and hence OS X); I think this would be a serious barrier to generic server-side usage of Swift, so I&#x27;m curious to see if they have done anything about that (and what).<p>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a fairly decent language. It doesn&#x27;t have Go&#x27;s concurrency baked in to the language, but on OS X you can use Grand Central Dispatch (libdispatch) which is a very decent concurrency library and it works very well with Swift, I&#x27;m hoping it will be available in the Linux port of Swift as well.<p>Besides the more sophisticated type system, a major advantage (or disadvantage, depending on how you look at it) of Swift over Go is it&#x27;s memory management mechanism: it uses Automatic Reference Counting, which makes garbage collection more deterministic and efficient, at the expense of a certain level of overhead in the developer&#x27;s thought process (e.g. the developer has to be mindful of things such as reference cycles etc).",1449158346

10670242,comment,10668957,10669287,0,0,discardorama,,,"> I saw the writing on the wall when she cancelled the work from home policy<p>Disclaimer: I was at Yahoo when she came and implemented this policy.<p>It irritates me to see uninformed people making such blanket comments. You have no idea what the policy was; I do. Let me explain it, in the hope that you (and others with this mindset) may learn something about it, and maybe even change their views.<p>There was a group of Yahoos ( < 200 ) who had a permanent work-from-home exemption (if you can call it that; there was never much of an enforced policy earlier). They never came in to an office (except for the occasional IT issue and package pickup). There were a couple of incidents where these remote workers were found to be moonlighting. So a study was done to see how many of these remote workers actually VPNed in. After a month or two, it turned out, a good number of them were actually working part-time. So a blanket ban was issued, with the caveat that if you could make a compelling case, you would still be allowed to WFH. In fact, a colleague of mine continued to work from home after this policy change. A number of strong people continued to WFH; a few were let go; and the rest had to hoof it to office.<p>Now, the mistake Marissa made wasn&#x27;t with this policy; but it was in how she didn&#x27;t go the next step: <i>holding the managers of the shirkers responsible</i>.<p>Which brings me to <i>my</i> thinking about why it&#x27;s so hard to turn around Yahoo: the middle management. (Please do me a favor and read PG&#x27;s excellent post <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/yahoo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/yahoo.html</a> after you&#x27;re done reading this). Yahoo is filled with managers whose sole contribution is survival. There is no accountability for screwing up. Fucking up products badly has never gotten anyone fired.<p>Did you know Yahoo went through 3 different iterations of an attempt at a &quot;social network&quot;? Each and every time, sane minds pointed out that the concept was bad, the UX was bad, etc.; and yet the managers prevailed and it went down in flames, as predicted.<p>The joke in Yahoo used to be: throw everything into version 1.0, because you never know if there will be a version 1.1.<p>Marissa is failing not because she&#x27;s a bad CEO (having seen Yahoo CEOs like Terry Semel, I can assure you she&#x27;s the best they&#x27;ve had in the last 10 years); it&#x27;s because she has no supporting cast. She trusts people too much. One manager once said to me (about her): meh, she&#x27;ll be gone in a couple of years; I&#x27;ll still be around. He had been there since 2001, and had no intention of moving anywhere. Collected fat paychecks by taking credit for others&#x27; work. And he was just one of many, many in there. Over the years I encountered so many people like him, where you had no idea what actually they contributed to the company.<p>/rant",1449158127

In exchange, you receive ownership interests. Though you have a fiduciary obligation to other owners, you control the LLC (as manager) or FLP (as general partner). You can give ownership interests to your children, which removes value from your taxable estate. These interests cannot be sold or transferred without your approval, and because there is no market for these interests, their value is often discounted. This lets you transfer the underlying assets to your children at a reduced value, without losing control.<p><a href=""https://www.estateplanning.com/Understanding-Estate-Taxes/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.estateplanning.com/Understanding-Estate-Taxes/</a>",1449157416

Companies want to be successful. That means compromise in a million different ways as bold moves can lead to bankruptcy, boycotts, competitors coming in and taking your market share, etc. Companies have an incentive to play ball as they want to survive and be competitive. Government, on the other hand, survives by default and doesn&#x27;t have to be  efficient at all.<p>The reality is that good government works when we have all players mobilized and part of the process. Its incredibly cynical to just claim the rich make laws to benefit themselves, especially considering that the US runs on a popular democracy model to the point of directly electing the highest office, which is unheard of in parliamentary democracies.  The rich are vastly outnumbered. Perhaps you should consider that a lot of regular people vote in policies that are pro-business because they want jobs and wealth in their area. Not everyone can become a silicon valley hotshot or NYC finance banker. Those &#x27;red state&#x27; policies you hate so much bring in employers, jobs, create wealth, etc. We tried communism. Turns out it didnt work. In fact it led to the deaths of 50-100m people and created autocracies, war, political persecution, poverty, and misery on a level unimaginable before.<p>My friends here in Chicago are all looking for new jobs because a couple employers have already left and many are planning on leaving as the tax level and anti-business attitudes here are killing the economy. This is a city of 3m people with a $550b GDP and we have a junk credit rating and no one knows how to pay off these fatcat union pensions. So yeah, be careful what you wish for. When the average guy has political power, he just writes checks for his friends at the cost of the taxpayer and the local economy. Without the business owning class calling some of the shots, there&#x27;s really no incentive to do anything right as you can just keep dipping into the public treasury and when that runs out just keep raising taxes per the Chicago model.

They can more easily identify noise from signal than previously thought, we&#x27;re only looking at hidden services (which number far fewer than the number of public websites), hidden service pages change much less frequently than public ones, and they exclude data points that could raise the false positive rate.<p>Also note that the classifiers here were even better at identifying specific clients than what hidden services they were accessing. So, not only is your hidden service not safe, neither are your users :-)",1449157348

So it makes sense that increasing muscle mass, increasing energy use (physical activity/muscle recovery), or decreasing glucose intake (caloric deficit/ketogenic diet) would have dramatic effects on the symptoms of diabetes.<p>Ultimately, addressing diabetes is an issue of handling glucose storage through increasing capacity, increasing energy and/or reducing high-glycemic intake of glucose.",1449155699

Unlike the Prius, the brakes escalate in a predictable a familiar fashion.  Most regenerative braking systems do not scrub speed from the car in the same linear fashion as the 918.  This is a major accomplishment because it makes the transition from regular brakes to regenerative brakes seamless and allows for spirited driving.<p>2) The batteries are not designed to store a substantial amount of charge, instead they are designed to provide a large chunk of the acceleration power that would normally come from a gasoline engine in a hybrid.  Instead of designing the car to utilize batteries for long-ranges, Porsche designed the car to utilize batteries for sprints.<p>3) The net result is a car that is as spirited as a traditional sports car but with greatly increased efficiency.  People that wont buy a Prius or BMW Hybrid right now because of the ride quality issues would be willing to purchase a car with the 918 style system.<p>The school of thought behind the Prius to squeeze every drop of efficiency out of the electric side, the school of thought behind the 918 is to support spirited driving with the electric side.  Both lead to increases in efficiency but only the latter is something people that consider themselves &#x27;drivers&#x27; would buy.<p>You can see this with Turbochargers as they are just now starting to trickle onto sport vehicles such as the BMW M4 and Ferrari has acknowledged that they will be pursuing the technology in their road cars in the near future.",1449154820

Bonus points for showcasing one of Apple&#x27;s new technologies (right now things like 3D Touch or iPad Pro optimization).<p>2) Get noticed by Apple: if you can make a small splash, Apple may make you a bigger one. Apple are kind of like app journalists: they are scouring the web to find out about upcoming gems or breakaway successes. I&#x27;m sure they also look at what new apps are making a splash in the charts. I think they found my first app, Grades, because I wrote a blog exploring how to build successful apps and some folks at Apple read it. You can also meet Apple folks on Twitter, conferences, and especially WWDC.<p>After consistently releasing apps that Apple is impressed with, they may start to build a more personal relationship with you and that&#x27;s the goal.<p>Some people think this is all about luck but, as someone who started as a poor college student no one knew about, I found there is a method to the madness.",1449154813

I remember watching my mother edit documents in the MASS-11 (<a href=""http://www.stanq.com/blog/?p=11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanq.com/blog/?p=11</a>) word processor on a VT-100 terminal. If her session fell off she'd ring an operator and he'd play her session back on the screen; it looked exactly like this!",1235901422

498882,comment,498210,498554,0,0,olavk,,,"Semicolon insertion <i>is</i> a bad thing, because it is unintuitive and may lead to subtle bugs.<p>If the rule was straightfoward, like a newline always corresponds to an automatic semicolon, then it would be OK. Now the rule require you to have a pretty deep understanding of the language grammar, to determine when a newline changes the semantics.<p>The intention was good: to optionally allow a more line-oriented syntax like Python, but it turns out that this just dot fit well with c-style syntax.",1235901177

498880,comment,498760,498760,0,0,jrockway,,,"This is interesting, but not for the reasons Jeff suggests.  bzip uses all 8 cores for 21 minutes to produce a 986M file (or 2 minutes for 1092M), while 7zip doesn't use all 8 cores, and produces a file smaller than anything bzip can produce, in 5 minutes.<p>So it looks like 7zip is not just slightly better than bzip; it's <i>much</i> better.  Ideally you can utilize all your cores by piping data from the DB directly into the compressor -- the compressor will use 2 cores (or whatever), and your database will use the rest.",1235901041

It is becoming increasingly important for applications to run in several different environments: browsers, social networks, handheld devices, and much more.<p>The technology seems cool, but why are they trying so hard to mimic OSX desktop applications?",1235900661

498874,comment,498449,498751,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"If I understand what you are saying I completely agree :)<p>The point I think you're making is that movies cost less than other forms of entertainment.  So people who are still seeking entertainment but have a more limited budget tend to go to the movies more.<p>So as an example, a family might have planned to go to Disneyland but now that their cash is more constrained they settled for Pizza and a Movie.  Hence movie sales go up in a bad economy while more expensive entertainment goes down",1235899539
498873,comment,496754,496934,0,0,jaspertheghost,,,"Innovation and utility is defined by use.  If people want to use social networks and not some microformats to enable the semantic web, that's innovation.  All this complaining about working on worthwhile products has some truth to it, but look at the utility of lasers.  In the end, lasers enabled cd/dvd's for millions of people to watch movies and music, and that's the ultimate utility.",1235899145

There are always methods to block ads, e.g. user-classification, preloading of content, alteration of flash, domain tracing...<p>Edit: This could be thought of like an analogy to spyware detectors, i.e. ad-aware. They have a ton of custom detectors, which are continually updated to classify spyware. I would certainly pay for a commercial free web.",1235898786

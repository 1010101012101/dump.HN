In parts I could almost feel the author pull his punches in a sad effort to try to make as many people happy as possible.<p>The key problem is this: whatever a university is, it&#x27;s too expensive for the ability of the average student to pay back. That means it&#x27;s a bad deal for both the student and society. Paying for more of it is just going to continue the spiral.<p>I have a different question. We know that training for future jobs is a requirement of some post-secondary institution. That&#x27;s just a given for many fields with the complexities of modern life. So what about a good, solid, liberal arts education? The one thing that universities were supposed to be masters of for centuries? The one thing that allows each of us to participate in and enjoy life to its fullest? Where does society go for that?<p>We can&#x27;t go to the universities, because we&#x27;ll end up in a long, pointless argument about what the purpose of universities are.

7827227,comment,7826275,7826671,2,0,mpyne,,,"> &quot;So how do you explain that you lied before?&quot; (silence)<p>Given that the email they showed does not represent a change to their story (that they never received an emailed concern from Snowden) I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s obvious it was a lie.<p>After all, Snowden&#x27;s question was purely procedural, not a pronouncement of wrongdoing of any sort. The most action you&#x27;d possibly expect to be taken as a result of that email is that NSA&#x27;s internal training adds a footnote to the hierarchy of authorities slide.<p>> Was anyone at the NSA ever punished for lying to the public or Congress?<p>The man who lied to Congress is the DNI, not a member of the NSA, and his testimony was a designed sandbagging: He could be charged with an actual crime no matter which answer he had given, so I&#x27;m not surprised that the DOJ isn&#x27;t racing to proffer charges here, especially since the Senator asking the question both already knew the answer, and knew that he could have given the answer to the public directly, if he wished, since he has Congressional immunity to his comments on the Senate floor.<p>The NSA itself doesn&#x27;t talk to the public as a rule, so it would be hard to convict members of them of lying in the first place. Their public statements are clearly designed to be at least technically truthful.<p>So I&#x27;m concerned then, that this has all become a giant echo chamber: People are fed information and use that to confirm that which they already believe, even when the evidence actually presented is contradictory. I know you&#x27;re probably trying to vent more than anything but I don&#x27;t see as a possibility that many people here will be changing their mind any time soon.<p>And I say that as someone who changed <i>my</i> mind; one of my highest-voted comments here was in support of Snowden on the occasion of the first story that popped up, before it became clear that the story being presented wasn&#x27;t the same as the story as it actually was.",1401569477

For one thing the three letter agency snooping somewhere on the backbone can&#x27;t even see the identity of the parties involved.  They will typically see NATted IPs on both ends of some service provider.  Once they decode the protocol they can get a little more information but at the end of the day the difference between knowing you established an SSL connection with respect to some static site and seeing the actual content of the page that you&#x27;ve viewed is IMO not a big difference.<p>The bigger deal is the confusion it creates and the assumptions a lot of the users of self signed certs (and certs in general) make about security.<p>Lastly I want to point out that if your certificate is signed by some external entity that doesn&#x27;t prevent you from doing out-of-band management of your public key.  As long as your private key is secret you never lose any security by having your cert signed by a third party.  People can argue about how secure that signature is vs. those agencies who can force the third party to reveal their secret key but while that&#x27;s an important consideration, until the government sells my banking information to somebody I mostly care about this at a principle level.",1401569046

Most overall relative mobility measures fell, on net, with mobility significantly lower in the 1995–2005 period than in the 1977–1987 period. Origin-specific measures also declined, with families starting in the poorest quintile less likely to make far moves (to the middle or higher quintiles) during the 10 years from 1995 to 2005 than within the 1977–1987 period.<p>> Similarly, absolute quintile mobility declined overall and for poor families after 1981–1991 (when real post-government income growth began to slow). Thus, families have become increasingly less likely to change rank or move out of their (relative or absolute) decile or quintile of origin, and when they move, to move less far; this appears to be the case overall and for those who start rich or poor.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/wp/wp2011/wp1110.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/wp/wp2011/wp1110.pdf</a>",1401568384

Everything from being able to craft some of the things I needed for my wedding (designing my ring to sewing a ring pillow and painting table numbers) to just everyday mundaneness when I&#x27;m meeting with a client and I can just draw out what they&#x27;re thinking and get the point across easily. The piano especially useful because it&#x27;s so relaxing and good for taking my mind off stress/pain better than painkillers.<p>Never in a million years as a kid would I have thought sitting in an art history class or 10+ years of playing a piano would come in as handy as all the obsessive studying I did of science, english, math and other classes. I&#x27;m so disappointed courses like that are disappearing (along with home ec - never had that, but my husband can&#x27;t mend clothes or cook...) but so many people are struggling with basic math/language skills that I can understand why.",1401568180

The company, boss, the end users could have cared less and provided nothing on your list of &#x27;good things&#x27;, but it was still a job I enjoyed working at.<p>I&#x27;ve also worked for companies that checked every &#x27;this should be awesome&#x27; box, and found it soulless, with a poor team of folks doing just enough to skate buy on their cushier salaries and lower hours.<p>Anecdata aside, it&#x27;s like asking if it&#x27;s possible to have a good life in America: it depends on what you want, but probably, yes.  Where you live, what you do, who you socialize/work with, etc. is highly personal, and drives everything.  While YOU (hypothetical you) may think the Silicon Valley is amazing, I know great folks who want nothing more than to live 50 miles from their neighbors in the woods in Maine.  They&#x27;re happy, etc. doing what they do, living how they live.  They&#x27;d be miserable in NYC or the Valley.  Likewise, hypothetical you would be miserable in their log cabin in the woods.<p>You might love Google or Yahoo or Microsoft, while someone else absolutely hates it.  That&#x27;s got VERY little to do with policy, and nearly everything to do with your personal life philosophy and the team/individuals you end up working with.",1401566782

Here&#x27;s challenging: I would find many of the same people insufferable as she does.  That doesn&#x27;t mean I feel a right to go telling the whole world that most people around me are unworthy of love or friendship, and that the world will have to <i>fix itself</i> by importing a fresh supply of people <i>I</i> happen to like.<p>There was a time when I might have thought like that... at age 15.  Well, and maybe up through 19.  And I <i>still</i> have a hard time finding <i>real</i> common ground with people who aren&#x27;t <i>at all</i> nerdy.<p>But hey, diversity is the spice of life!  I <i>like</i> having things I don&#x27;t understand about explained to me!  Just last night at Shabbat dinner, I sat across from a fresh new cellular biology grad-student and asked him what his lab does.  I did <i>not</i> dismiss him as a peer, even when I grew disinterested because the talk turned to the various drugs he and some electrical engineering type had indulged in during undergrad.  At that point I went over and listened to my friend the host of the house (and twenty-something Lubavitch shaliach to my neighborhood) giving his religious lecture for the evening.<p>Whom <i>did</i> I dismiss as a social peer, politely ignoring for the rest of the night?  The guy who thought there was something unpleasant about describing growth rates using terms like &quot;logarithmic&quot;, &quot;linear&quot;, &quot;polynomial&quot; and &quot;exponential&quot;, who considered me <i>less human</i> for knowing.<p>This is something that has happened <i>repeatedly</i> to me throughout life, and it leaves me with rather more empathy for the boring nerds the author doesn&#x27;t like dating than for the stuck-up philosophy-major-turned-journalist who can&#x27;t be bothered to take an interest in lifestyles beyond the underground hippie/artist/rocker crowd that brought her to Seattle in the &#x27;90s.  To me, she sounds like an insufferable hipster, coincidentally.<p>Maybe she&#x27;ll never take an interest, but these are still human beings, not spoiled meat.  Just because I don&#x27;t like brogrammers or workaholic money-mongers on a personal level doesn&#x27;t mean that I want them dehumanized, any more than I like being dehumanized for being a nerd.

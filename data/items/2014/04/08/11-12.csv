7552776,comment,7546394,7549271,1,0,mcherm,,,"Yes, as a prospective lender I would be satisfied if I saw the interest and fees as a flat interest rate (and clearly labeled as such), but ALSO displayed the rate that the borrower was paying in terms that were familiar to me, such as an APR.<p>I work in the US mortgage industry where advertising of &quot;APR&quot; rates is mandated so consumers can easily compare different offers. Mortgages are still permitted to have all kinds of odd financial arrangements: fees and fee-like structures (points), negative fees (cash-back refinancing, negative points), different payment schedules (interest accrued in advance or in arrears, monthly or biweekly payment schedules), and much stranger things (balloon mortgages, even reverse mortgages), and also many things vary from loan to loan (for instance: some costs vary according to which county you live in).<p>All of that complexity gets baked into the APR. Fees are amortized over the life of the loan (or sometimes a shorter period). Various kinds of rates get boiled down into an annualized APR. This is far from perfect: no single number can make all that complexity truly comparable, but it roughly does it&#x27;s job. Each individual loan has an APR calculated once its rates and fees have been set, and marketing messages must quote APR using a sort of &quot;typical loan&quot; for that lender. I think you could develop a definition for &quot;APR&quot; that handled the flat payment method but made it comparable for someone like me.",1396957837

It&#x27;s illogical and impossible.<p>Of course it&#x27;s not. And the argument you&#x27;re bringing up is laughably weak.

I&#x27;ve shown the early quran pages to Semitic scholars (not Jews in case you&#x27;re wondering) at my university, and while they can&#x27;t read them smoothly, they can read them. With appropriate books, so can I (very slowly, sure). They also said that Luxenberg is right. I&#x27;ve also taken the same early quran page copies to an islamic scholar, freshly imported into the university, and it was blatantly obvious that he doesn&#x27;t even recognize them, or the writing, despite having over 20 years of study at Al Azhar. I had to actually TELL him what it was, yet it was the thing they&#x27;ve supposedly been studying for 20 years.

Would it be a safe assumption that, generally speaking, those at the top of their field not only want to get paid what they&#x27;re worth (or more), but want the whole package, whether that is a guarantee to work on projects that interest them, or carte blanche in terms of your ability to choose how you spend your time.<p>Would such folks ever consider taking lower pay to work for what you&#x27;d consider to be a &quot;socially conscientious&quot; employer?<p>The reason for this question is I&#x27;ve wanted to begin compiling data that would make it easier for those at the top of their field to make the more &quot;socially conscientious&quot; decision about who writes their paycheck.  And even in the rare case persuade those at the top of their field to pursue employment with the more &quot;socially conscientious&quot; company.  The analysis (as to who is more worth) of course comes in many forms and would be interpreted in many different ways, so I envision more of a repository where a person would go to get the raw data in an organized / accessible fashion, instead of that data being hidden behind a &quot;5-star rating&quot; for example.<p>The hypothesis I&#x27;m considering here is that empowering people to make the right decisions about who employs them has the potential to (over time) help to ensure that those companies who have the best track records as being socially conscientious could end up being market leaders and not just an after thought within the markets that they serve.",1396956321

In my opinion, if someone rents out a rented apartment, that should be subordinated to the subletting clause in their lease, but if someone owns an apartment, they should be able to rent it out to whomever they please, at whatever frequency, and charge whatever price they like to do so. They are, of course, obligated to take responsibility for any disruptions, nuisances, damage, etc. caused by the guests, as per normal building regulations, but I don&#x27;t think the possibility of renting itself should be impaired by any local regulations.  The Airbnb model is simply disruptive, and hotels don&#x27;t like that. That&#x27;s how I see it.<p>I am especially unsympathetic to the argument that the neighbours have a &quot;right&quot; not to live &quot;next to a hotel&quot;. There&#x27;s nothing inherently hostile about a hotel as an application of an apartment, versus any other less controversial applications of an apartment that result in occasional comings and goings of strangers, such as parties and social gatherings. If the hotel causes them specific problems, they have a right to redress those specific grievances. That&#x27;s about it.<p>My view of this is strongly connected to the idea that property rights to real estate should incorporate the freedom to use the property as you&#x27;d like, as long as it doesn&#x27;t harm anyone. I don&#x27;t find much plausibility in the idea that renting it out in and of itself harms anyone. Many things that Airbnb renters can do can cause annoyance or harm. So can a drunk friend getting rowdy at my dinner party. So what? I can&#x27;t have guests? Oh, I can? What about guests that stay a few days? Yeah? Why not paying guests then?",1396955885

7552615,comment,7545791,7546290,1,0,icu,,,"Okay well there isn&#x27;t any right answer here and honestly what you are asking is extremely broad.  Any advice is only valuable if it is tailored to your situation.<p>My biggest question to you is, “do you have a business plan?”  Sure the thing gets obsolete the moment it hits the printer but I&#x27;ve found the discipline of writing one and doing the financials a very good thing.<p>If you don&#x27;t have a business plan I would honestly start there. New Venture Creation: Entrepreneurship for the 21st Century by Timmons has an excellent Business Plan Template.  In my younger years I won a business plan competition at my university with it.  The book also has a good opportunity screening framework which is really helpful.  Buy a second hand copy of the book and you don&#x27;t need the latest edition.  I have the 5th edition of the book and it is used time and time again when needed to do business plan stuff.<p>Once the full business plan is done, I have found that condensing it all down into a one page business plan for the start-up team members keeps everyone in the loop about the big picture moving forward.  You will probably need to keep revising the one page business plan depending on what is actually going on.  I wouldn&#x27;t change the full business plan unless you are doing a major pivot or if any significant amount of time has passed (like 1 year).<p>Having worked through the full business plan you will have figured out where you want to go and what you will need to get there.  How you move forward really depends on what type of business you are in, and what your business model is.  You should have also done a bit of project planning in the business plan and I would have paid close attention to the critical path of your start-up (and maybe done a Gantt Chart with who is doing what).<p>Having said that I would pay close attention to your burn rate—or how quickly you are using up your cash.  This is sometimes called your &#x27;runway&#x27; for launch but I like to call it your &#x27;death clock&#x27;.  You must get to a point as quickly as possible where you are break even including a living wage for founders and staff.  I think PG from HN has a blog post somewhere about being &#x27;Ramen Profitable&#x27; which might be worth a read.<p>Anyhow having a &#x27;death clock&#x27; can motivate you and your team to hit break even before you run out of cash and die.  Fear is an excellent motivator in the short run.  If you have a great team I don&#x27;t think you need to really push them too hard beyond that because they will know what they need to do to get to break even before you die (if they don&#x27;t what the heck are they doing in your start-up team?).  Having said that you&#x27;ll need good team communication and coordination and I would say weekly meetings with a sort of whip-around where everyone gets a chance to tell it how it is... something like:<p>A) This is what I did last week, this is what I&#x27;m doing this week\nB) This is what I worked, this is what didn&#x27;t work\nC) I need help/I&#x27;m at full capacity/I have spare capacity.<p>Also try to get someone to summarize the team&#x27;s progress against your critical path.  Are you early, on track or behind?  If you are behind what can the team do to get back on track?<p>If you have already hit the break even milestone, congratulations... you have a new type of problem set on your hands.  You&#x27;ll need to do the same sort of process but motivate with carrots rather than fear.  This really starts to get business specific.  If you give more info maybe I can offer more ideas.<p>Good luck!",1396955339

The mail body modifications seem to me like something mailing lists could drop taking advantage of the list-* headers instead. The harder usability issue arises from the fact that DMARC imposes a different way of setting the from header potentially breaking all those filters we&#x27;ve set up.<p>DMARC claim both issues can be solved using &quot;Original Authentication Results&quot; header but since it requires the receiving MTA to trust the mailing list the administrative overhead here just doesn&#x27;t scale and will likely end up being pushed onto the list admins.<p>Also, SPF <i>does</i> come into it since DMARC requires &quot;alignment&quot; between the from domains in the envelope and the header (see again the FAQ answer above).",1396954873

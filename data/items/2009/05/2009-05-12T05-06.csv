604961,comment,603865,604149,0,0,ghshephard,,,"First Major Flaw in Times Reader: Almost all figures, diagrams, and charts are missing.    These are present in the Paper, Electronic Edition, and nyt.com.  In some cases you barely notice the missing diagram, but in others, such as the Lincoln Center Remodel article, in which _the entire diagram showing the remodeled Lincoln Center - including colored elements showing what has been completed, and what is under construction_ - it's a gaping hole.<p>Particularly painful are the missing graphs/charts for business articles.  WSJ is typically better than NYT, but eliminating them altogether seriously devalues the Times Reader.",1242107884

Provide arguments in favor of the other's opinion, provide arguments against your own position, counter-arguments against your arguments, etc., all the while providing context and relative valuations of the arguments. When the other party is not capable of arguing their case or they need to be convinced that your case is superior, then this will not only broaden your view on the subject, but it will also give you a good chance of steering the outcome towards the solution you prefer.<p>Of course, if you are just discussing matters with smart colleagues to flesh out dis(advantages), then you don't have to do that much work and can just ride the waves.",1242106062

For example: while I <i>could</i> ask Google to solve 2+2, I still have a web page wrapped around the result (that probably replaces whatever web page I was using); with Spotlight, the answer to 2+2 appears before I even hit Return, and when I hit Esc the entire query box disappears and I can resume what I was doing before.  <i>That</i> is how a ""super location bar"" needs to work.",1242104506

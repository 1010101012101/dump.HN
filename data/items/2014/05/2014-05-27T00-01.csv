It is also one of the fastest growing divisions of Microsoft. During Q2 FY14, revenue from the commercial segment, which includes servers, commercial office licensing and cloud platform, grew 10% to $12.66 billion driven by higher SQL server sales and adoption of the cloud based Azure platform. Many customers of Microsoft depend on SQL servers for mission critical and business intelligence needs, specifically in the big data analytics domain. As a result, Microsoft&#x27;s SQL server revenue grew by 11%, outpacing the server market. Additionally, its Azure cloud offering clocked in triple digit growth in revenues. We&#x27;re encouraged by the continual growth that this division posted, and it is becoming an important driver for Microsoft&#x27;s value.",1401152273

Your dryer starts an hour before you wake up so that your clothes are dry, your underwear is warm and toasty to face that cold winter&#x27;s day. You can check from the supermarket if there was anything you don&#x27;t have at home for the cake you&#x27;re baking. The lights slowly dim to get your brain thinking it&#x27;s ready for bed. Your lights change colour to make the room feel warmer or colder. The blinds slowly open just before you&#x27;re supposed to wake up so that you can be woken by light rather than an alarm clock. Your oven begins cooking the roast to work around your schedule. Stopping the microwave from continuing to nuke the popcorn from the other room so you can wait for it to cool without getting up.<p>None of these are particularly brilliant and maybe you would look at it and ask why spend an extra thousand on a fridge for this? An extra 50 a light-bulb... A few thousand for installation of a base system just to have the privilege. Another 500 for motors for blinds. And each of those is just for one nice hardly noticeable difference in your day.<p>Maybe the cost for the value doesn&#x27;t make sense. It won&#x27;t for a lot of people. Having said that it seems to me that what we&#x27;re talking about here is automating some of the duties of a butler/body servant type job, at a lower cost than employing one for something that will be in place longer.<p>I&#x27;ll also add some good old anecdotal stuff at the end about some of the silly little contraptions I&#x27;ve found in my apartment in Japan and the difference they make. I&#x27;ve got an automatic bath tub push a button and it fills to an appropriate level at a temperature you set. It seems so silly  to spend the money to save yourself two minutes of faffing about with taps for something you might do every other week or once a month. But without that two minutes and without the pressure to not let it overflow I have nice relaxing baths much more often because all I need to do is push a button and finish whatever I&#x27;m doing before grabbing a book. \nThere are also remotes for the lights. It&#x27;s great to walk in the door grab the one remote and walk through the place turning on and off the lights on my way to the lounge to settle down all without having to go slightly off towards one wall or another, this seems small (or ridiculously lazy) but I honestly think I&#x27;ll spend the money when I move to keep this tiny freedom. Being able to turn the lights on and off from bed and freely rearrange rooms without worrying about light-switches is an added bonus as well as dimming by remote are all great and have made ever day slightly more pleasant. There are a few other contrived convenience around (there are others that I was used to that are missing here though) and I can honestly say that quite a few of them are something that have made necessities slightly easier or enjoyable things more accessible. I&#x27;ll definitely be hunting out these little conveniences when I&#x27;ve  left. So there&#x27;s my two cents.",1401151898

It&#x27;s not really a specialist, more of a jack of all trades.<p>For example PHP is all about web development. Ruby is probably most well known for Rails and also widely used for web development. Python is widely used for web development, but that&#x27;s not necessarily the first thing you think of for Python.<p>What&#x27;s going to keep any programming language alive is the libraries that become so well entrenched that a competing library would have a serious uphill battle to even come close to matching functionality. Python has a lot of libraries like this for scientific tools.<p>I&#x27;m always skeptical to hear that a developer has moved from X programming language to Go. I wonder how many of these tales are from developers who are actually referring to what they do in their spare time rather than their day jobs. Go is still early enough that doing the sorts of things which create the most jobs is still more painful than it needs to be (and so you would probably be doing these things in a different ecosystem.) It seems that the real Go job generating stories are from start-ups which have hit some momentum, received funding and are rewriting parts of their stack in Go.<p>The mass job generators are still at the Rails / Django / PHP / JS levels.",1401150667

7802279,comment,7800752,7802210,29,0,gig3m,,,"Disclosure:  I run one of the largest wooden pallet manufacturing companies in the United States.  My family has been in this business for 50+ years.<p>Your perspective on whitewood comes from a 3rd tier perspective (grocery, as you say).  In other words your various suppliers buy their pallets from various sources and then ship their product into you on those pallets.  You and your (former?) employer are not directly involved in their procurement so you have little say in what you get, and I&#x27;m sure the quality varies widely.<p>That being said whitewood pallets (or just wooden as we would say) are actually a very cost effective and reliable way to ship product in the US, much more so than plastic.  There are many quality manufacturers around the entire nation that provide great product and service, much better than your experience seems to suggest.  Plastic is expensive to buy, more expensive to lose, and has various other problems and concerns.<p>To compare a built CHEP pallet with a &quot;whitewood&quot; pallet is a bit misleading however in several directions, especially to come to the conclusion that they are the &quot;good stuff&quot;.  They are the good stuff in terms of build quality because (by my estimation) they are built roughly 3x as strong as a generic 48x40 (standard GMA pallet.)  They also cost upwards of 3x as much to manufacture and the process is no different than the bad quality pallets that you have had experience with.  (Estimated GMA is about $10-11 per, CHEP block pallet would be above $30, depending on locale.)  Of course they hold up better, they are built to do so.  However, the pallet industry has gone from standardization on sizes in the last 20 years (GMA 48x40, Coke pallet 36x36 mentioned below) to being specifically engineered to the load it was made to carry.<p>TL;DR:  There are wooden pallet manufacturers out there that produce a high quality product.

And higher level programs like BackupPC and Bacula are still excellent solutions.<p>It&#x27;s comprehensive, covers off-line bare metal backups (which aren&#x27;t exactly changing any time soon), points you at tools like rdiff-backup which you can use to get reasonably close to continuous data protection (I do it every hour), etc. etc.  Along with a few good and short war stories.  And preps you for the big times, if you&#x27;re interested.",1401148972

While more libraries = more total content weight, using common libraries may reduce the weight of the content that actually gets loaded, by eliminating the requirement for redundant compatibility boilerplate and providing DOM manipulation tools that allow much of the page content to be created client-side.",1401148861

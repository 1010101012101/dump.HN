My argument is simply that proprietary-everything, all-in-one designs are a significant loss for the consumer and a huge win for the manufacturer, because they very effectively kill both the upgrade and repair industries, making the default response to buy more new equipment instead.<p>Given the disproportionately high rate of damage to mobile devices, and the relatively low starting specs, and the fact that most laptops (including Apple ones) have <i>not</i> had such severely restricted maintainability until very recently, this all seems like a huge step in the wrong direction, from the customer's point of view.<p>If it were only the screen on the Retina MBP, I could just about believe the theory that it was done to keep the size down, but it's obviously not only that screen.

4414867,comment,4412905,4412905,1,0,fjorder,,,"The relentless evolution of the PC was driven largely by PC gaming.  In the 90's and early 2000's you could rely on the fact that a PC bought one year would struggle with games made the following year and be incapable of playing at least some games made 2-3 years later.  As such, gamers eagerly adopted new hardware, overclocked, overspent by factors of 2 or 3 in the vain hope that it would buy them a few extra months (when in fact it was more sensible to buy a cheaper PC and upgrade more often).<p>Then a funny thing happened.  The video game market outgrew the movie market.  It started making financial sense to invest tens of millions in the development of a single game.  The cost of the content (i.e. character designs, level designs, script, voice acting, motion capture, etc.) far outstripped the cost of coding the engine.  It became a complete no-brainer to port games to as many platforms as possible to maximize your audience.  The corollary to this is that it became necessary to <i>design</i> games such that it was possible to port them to as many platforms as possible.  That meant that most developers stopped exclusively developing for one platform and instead started designing for them all.  While you can always tack on some superficial eye-candy on when the hardware supports it, games could not be designed to have basic gameplay requiring more resources than the slowest platform was capable of.  Thus, consoles became an anchor that brought the relentless march of PC game requirements to a screeching halt.<p>The Xbox360 and PS3, not to mention the Wii, are handily out-performed by today's desktops by a large degree.  Mobile phones are poised to pass them within a couple of years!  However, the games you can play on a PC are largely identical to the console versions.  Sure, there are some improved graphics, additional content, etc., but these differences are superficial.  In fact, if your hardware isn't the latest and greatest, most games can simply scale back the eye-candy to maintain performance.  Even PC-only developers, such as Blizzard, have recognized that they must build games with conservative minimum requirements in today's market.<p>The end result is that PC gamers can run new games with only superficial inferiority to what the latest generation of desktop hardware is capable of. They no longer <i>need</i> to upgrade their desktops.  At least, they won't until the next generation of consoles arrive.  When that happens there will be many new games designed with greatly increased resources in mind and a big wave of desktop upgrades will ensue.<p>In the end, PC obsolescence isn't really dead.  It's just quantized differently.",1345584329

There is no natural mapping for JSON in C++, C#, Erlang, Haskell, Prolog, SQL, or a wide variety of other languages (and Erlang and SQL are both fairly ""weakly typed""), and even in JS/Python/Perl/Ruby there are some edge cases that can bite you if you aren't careful about exactly what the ""just_decode_some_json_man()"" is <i>really doing</i> with Unicode and numbers that may not fit into 32 bits.<p>(Also, I scarequote all my ""weakly typed"" because the term is basically ill-defined.

Now, in particular with the iPad and trending with other machines, no specifications (beyond what amounts to ""small, medium, or large"") are given. Why? specifications are needed to convince buyers the product is good enough when it isn't.<p>Most users just want something that's capable enough that they don't have to think about the technical limitations. Most users glaze over at random-looking numbers associated with meaningless abbreviations denoting implementation details they don't understand; their question isn't ""how many gigahertz is the processor?"" it's ""if I click something will I be annoyed by the delay?"" The real answer to the latter question is ""yes, you will"". To obscure that dissatisfying answer, sellers toss out the profusion of specifications in an attempt to convince buyers that the product is good enough to buy anyway. Users, able to at least evaluate whether X > Y, compare the numbers and convince themselves that those numbers are as large as they can be and still have an affordable package.<p>Apple's goal is to sell hardware. With the onset of ""retina"" displays, flash memory, multi-core processors, iCloud, etc. all those specifications transition from confusion to ""good enough"". Doesn't matter what the number of pixels are, <i>you can't discern them</i> so it's good enough. Doesn't matter what the storage capacity is, between terabytes local and near-bottomless cloud behind it you won't run out. Flash is so fast you mostly won't care. Processor speeds equal supercomputers of recent past. It's all ""good enough"" - making the comparison between Apple products and ""lots of incomprehensible random numbers & abbreviations"" easy.<p>PC makers still flaunting specifications are saying ""no, really, it's good enough - see?"" making customers hesitate their purchase. Apple is going for ""details are irrelevant, it's good enough - period.""",1345583320

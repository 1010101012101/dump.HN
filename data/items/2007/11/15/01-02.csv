Then, demonstrate which things they can learn now which will get them closer to doing the very things they can't do.<p>If you can convey that each thing they learn can be used as a building block to learning things that are currently way out of their league you might have some success.",1195091838

79939,comment,79898,79898,0,0,jey,,,"Call me a cynic, but I think people just don't care enough to do it. I think a lot of people go to college because they're supposed to, or to get a good job, etc. That's not wrong or bad, but it's just not going to be conducive to self-study.<p>Once/if you do care, you can set goals and keep working on it until you figure out what works for you.",1195091652
79938,comment,78933,79919,0,0,DaniFong,,,"You totally have the option of just pretending community college never happened. Just don't mention that you were ever there.<p>I got fairly lucky with community college: there was another really bright student there. He coded a 3d engine in <i>ASM</i>. So I learned a lot from him.<p>I didn't guess that you wanted to study math, though it's not much of a guess that you'd like it. <p>The thing about math departments at research universities is that the field has largely been written by ex-prodigies (each textbook seems to include a mini-bio on galois...), and they don't care much for rules or structure since much of the faculty had to struggle with such artificial things anyway. <p>So I tended to have a lot of luck talking with math departments. I was quite a writer back then too -- better than the pupils of the English department, it seemed, but there I really doubt I would have gained the traction I had gained with the math department.<p>By the way, if you don't read Scott Aaronson or Terry Tao, I strongly suggest that you do -- they're wonderful bloggers, and Scott has a terrific (though unfinished) set of notes called Quantum Computing since Democritus. A book you might really like is ""What is mathematics"" by Courant -- it's wonderful. ",1195091527
79937,comment,79764,79808,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Indeed.  It's very impressive, and makes a great demo, but I can't think of a single type of user who wouldn't be better served by some desktop application.<p>For power users, the lack of different color modes (CMYK, Lab, 16 bit/channel) or any kind of color management, curves (or even levels!), the kind of rich interaction (shortcuts, modifier-clicks, etc.) that desktop apps allow, serious retouching tools, line drawing tools, precise text control, etc. etc. makes this almost completely useless.  Just the lack of the curves tool is frankly enough to doom any image editor (aimed at power users) which doesn't replace it with something of similar power.<p>For non-power-users, this is still missing important features, but it also has the same complex photoshop-like interface that has been confusing newbies for years.  The learning curve of Splashup is steeper than it is for products aimed at casual users; they are better served by those tools.<p>----<p>Clearly a lot of work went into splashup, and the technology will surely be useful for something--if nothing else it can be sold to some big company for piles of cash.  But in its current incarnation it's basically useless.",1195091300
79936,comment,79898,79898,0,0,curi,,,"Forced learning is unreasonable. If you can't demonstrate the merits of something, so that a student judges it would be a good idea to learn it (now), then in what position are you to say it really should be learned?<p>If motivation to learn something requires external incentives, then why bother learning it? We should learn things that are intrinsically worthwhile.",1195091288

79929,comment,79898,79898,0,0,bhewes25,,,"Overly simple answer money. Though even if you pay them how do you know how much they have learned? Certifications such as MCSE, CCNP, RHCE or any other of the acronym certifications. Or in the case of the Finance industry the CAIA, CFA, FRM, PRM, what the hell ever tests. Work well for industry specific general information.<p>Another way I have found useful is give people a project a real market driven(IE come up with such and such of a product) or some safe lab project. Give basic guide lines and an incentive to finish and let them go at it. You will be amazed people come up with and what they learned to finish the project. Also always be there to help if the get stuck to give new ideas, but never do it for them. <p>Yet another way keep track of what above average knowledge of a topic each member of the  organization, I assume we are talking about a company, has. Make the list relevant to work so people do not think you are invading their privacy and set each person up with another person who wants to learn such and such skill or knowledge base.<p><p>",1195090519

Seriously though, thanks for replying. <p>I did actually take classes at a Community College at the same time as when I was in high school, and I really hated it. It was academically like high school and socially like a Dilbertesque job (especially the programming classes). Worst of all, it led me to think that I don't like math. After a couple of years, I accidentally came across a textbook on mathematical logic and proofs, and it was like being hit on the head with a brick. I thought, ""Why did they hide this stuff from me?"". No wonder math had been frustrating--it wasn't really math, any more than using Windows is computer science.<p>Anyway! There are bad things in my Community College transcript. I wonder if that will hinder me, or if I have the option of just pretending it never happened...<p>Is there something special about math departments in universities (less corruption? a lot of influence?), or did you just guess, correctly, that I wanted to study math?",1195088613

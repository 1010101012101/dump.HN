But your comment seems to assume this is the norm, whereas the questionnaires I've looked at don't make that distinction.<p>Remember such insurance policies (issued to a FD) are upon life and limb, rather than on department revenue stability. An insurance company would challenge a payout if they felt the fire department (perhaps because of bad training or staffing policy) foolishly ordered a crew into an impossibly dangerous situation resulting in injury or death, even if the property owner was a paying subscriber. In reality, fire crews sometimes have to let a property burn and just try to stop the fire spreading, because the presence of chemicals or an unsafe building structure makes it too risky to enter.",1286560441

1772530,comment,1772433,1772433,0,0,TGJ,,,"It's too bad that this guy misses the point of the phrasing.  People do not think money is evil because they themselves cannot make it, money is evil when people get that money without earning it and usually end up doing bad things with that money.  People that cheat are not going to do good things with the items they cheated to get.<p>If you understand that money is the way that we interact with other people by having a currency to exchange effort then you realize that the 'love' of money or the wanting of money that you have not earned is evil.  That trying to fake the amount of effort that you have created and trying to interact with other people on the basis that you have not contributed your part, then that is evil.  Money is the root of all that is good because it allows people to interact with each other without ever feeling obligated to a person for doing too many favor's and never getting a favor in return.<p>For instance, if someone asks you to do something and you and you ask for a few dollars to do it, then once the task is complete, then everything is balanced.  If on the other hand, you do the favor without getting a few dollars, you are then in debt to that person for a favor.  You might take pause at this moment but consider that the other person might come back and ask for another small favor, and another small favor.  At some point, you begin living for that person.  You might think that doing that favor makes you feel good and that is enough to balance the interaction but how any favors will it take before you no longer feel good doing them?  Money resolves this situation by allowing people to trade effort and not ever worry about the favor situations.  If you ask me to mow your lawn, I'm going to ask for something in return either through an appropriate level of a task or money.  There is a system of trade with built in honor.  Everyone knows that the money that the other person has is earned so it's fair to make exchanges.  Where it becomes evil is when lazy people cheat their way to money and try to engage in the system.<p>If you think you might agree with this statement, check out Objectivism and 'Atlas Shrugged' by Ayn Rand for a great breakdown on why money is not the root of evil, money is the root of all that is good.",1286559890

Apparently none of the banks was interested in checking his other purchases to see whether he had the means to handle 20 mortgages.  Of course, L. V. never told the banks that he had no intention of making the payments on any of these loans.<p>One by one, L. V. defaulted on the loans.  By the end of 2007, eight of the homes were in foreclosure.  Undeterred, he continued to collect rent from tenants whom he had put into these two-family homes.

Currently, very few restaurants sell online gift certificates. Many sell gift cards at the restaurants but if you need to order one online, they need you to fill a payment form, fax the form to them, after which they mail out the gift card. In todays world of instant gratification, this is missing out on potential revenue. The way this idea will work is to have a link on the restaurant's website to the site which will handle the payment and fulfillment of the gift certificates. Being an aggregator is not the goal in this idea.<p>I have talked to several restaurant owners and most seemed very excited and interested in the concept<p>2) Build an iphone app that will become a visual menu for restaurants:
Currently, restaurant menus are boring. They hardly include any  visual images of the menu dishes. Visual aesthetics / plating are a major component of the high end restaurant dishes. They way this idea will work is to have an iphone app and then build a catalog of restaurants and the photos of their menu dishes. When a diner visits a restaurant, they can fire up the app and see the photos of the various dishes.<p>The biggest hurdle that I see with the above ideas is selling to restaurants. Restaurant owners are a busy bunch - and simply getting in touch with them can be a challenge. Selling to them is a totally different beast.<p>I'd like to get the feedback of the HN community on these ideas. What do you think ?

Recruiting is also a zero-sum game: if you don't hire the best, your competitors will. That means if technology is an enabling factor in what you do (it doesn't have to be your core competence), empowering programmers is a competitive advantage.<p>I was at CUFP (Commercial Users of Functional Programming) recently where I had a conversation with Yaron Minsky of Jane Street. He mentioned that due to their use of OCaml (and being one of the few places in their industry where software engineers are not treated as second class citizens) they have a much higher quality of not only hires but applicants. He mentioned a job listing on a caml mailing list yielding a fairly small number of resumes, but a much higher percentage of these resumes translated into phone screens, on-sites and finally hires. I am not sure I'm allowed to disclose the percentage, but it's a fairly incredible number compared to what I've seen elsewhere; even the people they passed on, were of high quality.<p>They are effectively choosing ""the best of the best"". If someone is willing to learn spend the time to learn a non-mainstream language (this used to be Ruby and Python in 2004, but now they're Haskell/OCaml/Scala, CL/Scheme/Clojure, Erlang; this may change again, I see at least one of Scala, Clojure or Erlang becoming mainstream) -- and I am talking about actually learn, beyond ""fizz buzz"" -- chances are they have the passion and the work ethic to be a good programmer.<p>Of course this isn't a bijective map: there are good programmers who aren't interested in non-mainstream languages (in many cases they have highly specific knowledge e.g., machine learning where the language used doesn't matter as much), but I've yet to see someone take the time to learn Haskell on their own (without being forced to do so for a university course) who wasn't a good programmer: they may not be best of the best or a good fit for every position, but they are certainly not the kind of person you're going to regret bringing on-site to interview.",1286558793

They would argue that online relationships are inveterately shallow but displace our fraying real-word relationships with friends and family. But:  Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc. alongside broadband, wireless, cell-phone cameras, etc. seem to be doing something very meaningful to reverse the (real, though possibly exaggerated) problems those essays described.  And by correcting these problems and strengthening the social fabric, we may be indirectly reducing problems in healthcare, education, and poverty.<p>Again, the problem with the article is not really misprision of social networks, the problem is analyzing social impact at a level where Twitter = Zynga = LinkedIn.",1286558271

Not really, other than huge keys and secure algorithms.<p>What the government wants, however, is similar to what RIM provided Saudi Arabia (and what the USA wanted with its key escrow service years ago): a backdoor into an encryption scheme, or a copy of private keys.<p>Both from a computer security perspective and an interpreted Constitutional right to privacy, the government should need a warrant to get encrypted data. Just like they'd need a warrant to get your paper diary that you keep next to your laptop, they should (and currently do) require one to read your e-mail. And that's the way it should stay.",1286557478

He was told to read it himself, but reading the report yourself doesn&#x27;t necessarily tell you anything about the review/publishing process for the report. (Of course since it&#x27;s not in a scientific journal the chance it received peer review is pretty low.) Telling somebody to read something themselves may or may not be rude, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t an answer to the question.<p>I know everybody on HN likes to think they are an expert in everything, but reading &#x27;reports&#x27; by think tanks or other political institutions, even ones that cite scientific studies, is a good way to confirm your own biases, but not a necessarily a good way to educate yourself about contentious issues. If you are not familiar with the area of research you won&#x27;t know what has been missed or ignored or proven unrepeatable or flawed. A peer reviewed meta-study would be much more likely to include the full cross section of available research.",1374508714

Keep in mind where I live (a cold part of Canada), you can realistically only sell street food for 4-6 months out of the year.

I love Ruby as a language, but the pain of using Rubygems and random things requiring Ruby <1.9 and <1.8 (And setting up rvm to manage that) is an absolute pain. Python is slightly better, but I still have a python2 and python3 installed.<p>This is why I love mono. Things may not be backwards compatible, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem where something wasn&#x27;t forwards compatible. And I think this is a result of it being compiled. The compilation step decouples the language and syntax from the actual execution of the code. This means that compiled applications can have drastic and breaking syntax improvements, but still be forward compatible on future runtimes. The same can not be said of interpreted languages unless you somehow work a version number into the execution, and even then it makes implementation of the languages much harder because future versions must support every version of the syntax",1374508392

I would be much more worried about innocent or incidental witnesses being prosecuted over-zealously or maliciously.<p>For instance, until recently it was illegal to make an audio recording of another person without his or her express permission. These laws were put in place to prevent criminal &quot;wiretaps&quot; (for purposes of blackmail and the like). Of course every parent who recorded his daughter&#x27;s dance recital was also committing a felony, but since no one was ever charged for that, nobody complained.<p>But then the police realized that if they wanted to prevent someone from recording their illegal or embarrassing activities they could arrest the person for illegally wiretapping them. This led to a string of arrests and prosecutions for doing nothing more than documenting police brutality, incompetence or corruption. The point here is that laws have a way of being misused and some laws are easier to misuse than others. Censorship laws are in this category, so special consideration should always be given to the possible unintended consequences when such laws are considered.<p>Perhaps over-zealous or malicious prosecution doesn&#x27;t happen in the UK, this seems a bit far-fetched to me, but maybe it&#x27;s true.

How so? What about romance novels?<p>Romance novels as far as I am aware do not involve crimes.<p>> Not so fast. Are you assuming that anyone who would watch/read such a thing is trying to work up their nerve to commit/participate in a rape?

If it&#x27;s just a fantasy then it&#x27;s creepy but ok, the danger is when an echo chamber is formed and no dissenting voice exists.<p>> Is it your opinion that suppressing such material would prevent the behavior? Can you support that opinion with evidence? How about the fact that rape has existed before pornography?<p>No of course I don&#x27;t believe that suppressing such material would prevent the behaviour. The fact is that many rapists are mentally ill individuals. My hope is that careful management can reduce the exposure these individuals have to reinforcement.<p>> Is there some proof that viewing or reading such material will cause previously ordinary people to become psychopath/rapists? Or is it merely popular to want to externalize blame for one&#x27;s actions?<p>The danger is not to &#x27;previously ordinary people&#x27;. The danger is that people with predispositions can be convinced that they are right in their beliefs or feelings. For example, that feminism is against the &#x27;natural order&#x27;. That is quite a common one.<p>> But you want to start stamping it out on the internet first?<p>Not at all, if there existed such a place where people with rape fantasies could go to discuss them together I would support its closure and perhaps even the monitoring of its participants.

But, to hide it from those who walk among you who want to kill you.</i><p>Fear-monger much? What can you <i>not</i> justify with this line of reasoning? &quot;Well, we&#x27;re not herding you all up into concentration camps because of anything you&#x27;ve done innocent Americans. We&#x27;re putting you all there because of the evil Americans who walk among you.&quot;<p>If we buy the mindset that the &quot;evil-doers&quot; are indistinguishable from innocent Americans, then we will allow virtually anything.<p>And, is this overt paranoia inducement even remotely justified? I mean, really, what percentage of the so-called terrorists are &quot;other Americans that walk among us&quot;? For that matter, how many &quot;terrorists&quot; are really out there?<p>But, this is a subtle, insidious, and very purposeful shift. It&#x27;s an example of how they&#x27;ve moved the goalposts and are increasingly morphing these &quot;terrorist-tools&quot; into a hyper-surveillance program to keep tabs on all Americans. There was a time when they&#x27;d have to justify their actions and abide by Constitutional protections by pointing to foreign involvement in monitored communications. The line was that they are not monitoring us, as much as they are monitoring those foreigners who happened to be talking to us. Now, he&#x27;s allowing that Americans are specifically being targeted domestically, but that it must be done because the terrorists &quot;walk among us&quot;.<p>Also love the way the story frames the NSA activity as more benign and highly targeted:<p><i>&quot;[a program that] gathers data on numbers dialed and length of calls, though not call content, and another that allows the NSA to monitor overseas e-mails and Internet sites used by suspected terrorists.&quot;</i><p>Makes it sound highly targeted and less invasive to innocent Americans. But, we&#x27;ve already learned how they get call content, that the distinction between foreign and domestic communication is less meaningful than we originally thought, and other details that go beyond the benign characterization of the story. This story seems to be stuck in the days before so many more revelations came out.<p>They left out all but the &quot;This message brought to you by the NSA.&quot;",1374507200

6084322,comment,6080052,6080052,1,0,ScottWhigham,,,"Lots of good tidbits and examples in there - I really enjoyed reading that. There are several not-quite-inaccuracies-but-not-really-how-you-would-think moments in it but, overall, it&#x27;s very well written. The pictures were annoying after a while haha.<p>Just to clarify, this isn&#x27;t &quot;specific to SQL Server&quot; - SQL Server was originally a straight-up &quot;licensed by Microsoft&quot; version of Sybase SQL Server and thus it&#x27;s early code base (things that defined the Transact-SQL language) has almost all to do with Sybase and naught to do with Microsoft. Things like the plus sign as a string concatenator, the way numbers are handled when compared to strings - all of that was the way Sybase did it and, for whatever reason, Microsoft didn&#x27;t change it (we&#x27;re talking way back in the late 80s and early 90s). In fact, there&#x27;s not a single thing in that article that has changed or been implemented by Microsoft - nearly every one of the nitpicks/topics referred to by OP refer to the original choices made by the Sybase engineers. You could say, &quot;Yes, but Microsoft hasn&#x27;t changed this despite having 20+ years with the source code + standards!&quot; and that&#x27;s a valid point.[0]<p>1) TRIM - This has been asked for and discussed ad nauseum in the SQL Server and Sybase community. It always circles around the idea of VARCHAR though - the variable character type automatically trims trailing blanks thus, years ago, developers said, &quot;Ahhhh, screw it - no need for a TRIM() function! They just should use the LTRIM() function to get rid of the leading blanks.&quot; It&#x27;s not correct IMO but that&#x27;s always been the logic.<p>2) &quot;This behavior violates the standard and is specific to SQL Server.&quot; - I hate this statement. Which standard? What section? This is a case of it being easy to say something but, without backing it up with a citation, it implies that I trust the OP. I dont&#x27; know OP - maybe he&#x27;s right but maybe he&#x27;s interpreted &quot;the standard&quot; incorrectly, or is referring to an outdated standard, or is comparing SQL Server 2000&#x27;s interpretation of a later-written standard. There&#x27;s no way to know - it&#x27;s just too ambiguous.<p>3) ORDER BY in subqueries - I laughed when I saw this:<p>SELECT * FROM    \n(SELECT  TOP 100 PERCENT* FROM mytable... ORDER BY id) q<p><i>In nested queries and inline (single-query) table valued functions, ORDER BY is not supported unless TOP is used with the SELECT.</i><p>Kinda, sorta - it depends on which version of SQL Server you are referring to. SQL 2012 - yes. SQL 2008 - yes. The &quot;original&quot; SQL Server would have done what OP talks about - sorting w/ TOP - but, at some point, MSFT changed it to give the behavior he talks about. I can&#x27;t remember when - maybe SQL 2005 or, at worst, 2008 - but this is an example where using specific version names would be helpful.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server#History</a>",1374507054

The problem is that the 1% can change the whole world for you and force you to either be able to selectively detect what changes are made or throw out all your optimisations), and so to get fast Ruby implementations will either need to ask for guarantees from the developer (pragma&#x27;s to promise you&#x27;ll never alter Fixnum, even in eval() blocks, or flags to by default freeze all standard classes, for example), or they&#x27;ll need to start employing all the dirty tricks in the book.<p>Thankfully, the Smalltalk, Lisp, Self and Javascript worlds, amongst others, have pioneered plenty of dirty tricks that&#x27;ll do just fine (e.g. consider Polymorphic Inline Caches, pioneered in Self, I believe, that are now quite widely applied for dynamic languages)<p>I think we&#x27;ll eventually head towards a bit of both: Optional ways of making the job easier, such as promising not to much with things we normally don&#x27;t muck with anyway, combined with new meta programming libraries to remove the reasons for a lot of the eval() usage, that will allow implementations to make much better judgements about what <i>can</i> actually change (instead of assuming all bets are off after an eval()), and a large number of dirty tricks (in the form of caches + heuristics + guards in various variations, to be able to take fast paths most of the time and &quot;just&quot; fall back to slow code for pathological cases).",1374506837

You largely write various transforms and filters, which is right in FP&#x27;s wheelhouse.<p>On the other hand, simulation is quite state-full, often has tons of little details that you don&#x27;t want to expose to the world (encapsulation), the thing that you are simulating usually has a collection of varying behaviors that you can represent via polymorphism or composition, they have attributes, and the &#x27;engine&#x27; is often easier to write if you use dynamic(virtual methods)/static(generics)/duck polymorphism to get your things to do their, well, thing.<p>Which is not to say that either is undoable or really hard in the other paradigm, but if I am simulating something I am often thinking of &#x27;objects&#x27; and doing things to them; the OO paradigm helps you program about that in a very expressive way. Ditto for FP and functional programming - I&#x27;m thinking about filtering and transforming data.<p>That is just my view of the author&#x27;s article, with a caveat. I&#x27;ve seen terrible, beastly simulations done in OO that basically thought that single inheritance is how you spell OO. A single type hierarchy bites you so hard: &#x27;Oh, I&#x27;m make everything a widget with draw/eat/process/whatever methods&#x27;. Then requirements change, and widgets in this subtree need to do something you thought only widget in that other subtree would do, next requirement has you needing to reflect on who can do what, and so on. You end up with a huge Blob object at the top of your hierarchy, or you endlessly end up with huge blocks of RTTI/reflection to figure out what kind of thing you are dealing with, or otherwise try to work around the problem that the world is not easily decomposed into a single hierarchy.<p>In practice I find all of this terribly reductive. Need some small thing whose behavior varies in well defined ways? Use polymorphism. Have a bunch of stateful stuff that you need to keep track of? Encapsulation is nice. Want to perform some operation on a large collection of data? Look to transform(). Need to make a lot of inferences and conclusions? Perhaps logic programming will work there. Need to provide a framework where people can build larger systems? Hopefully you are using component or services based ideas. And so on. A programmer should have a bunch of tools handy, and use the best one for the job.

Nevertheless, the process is not very pleasant.<p>We are experimenting with Go in some smaller projects, and so far the experience is great! We can build on a development machine (OS X) with all the dependencies version controlled (using git-subtree) along with our code, and cross-compile a static binary for Linux for deployment. Deploying is simply copying the binary to the production machines (usual configuration management is done via Puppet).<p>Besides, Go can efficiently make use of multiple cores (remember to set GOMAXPROCS correctly), and we can just deploy one instance of an app per server, unlike one instance per core as in Python&#x27;s case (I know there&#x27;s multiprocessing, but it&#x27;s bad for operation and management). This greatly reduces memory overhead if the app is big (e.g. consumes a couple hundred of MB upfront and you have 32 cores per machine = a few GB&#x27;s memory is wasted).<p>Only problem is that Go&#x27;s 3rd-party libs are not as comprehensive as Python&#x27;s yet, and many packages we rely on do not have mature/reliable counterparts in Go.

Maybe I&#x27;m not old enough but I cannot remember a time when programmers would choose a platform based on their target userbase, unless they are forced to do so (e.g. iOS). Even back in 2000, given the choice, programmers would always choose to use their favorite language if they can. I remember that back in the days I was very much concerned about distribution. If I write an app in Java, users needed to download a 20 MB runtime (mind you, circa 2000 dialup was common). Visual Basic, Visual C++, etc all required some form of runtime. .NET was in its infancy and not widely distributed. I chose to write as much as possible in Delphi so that users only had 1 executable to worry about, even when Delphi wasn&#x27;t the most productive platform. I asked questions on various developer forums, and I was being ridiculed for thinking so much about user distribution; the consensus from the community was: pick a language they like, and the user will just have to put up with whatever additional multi-megabyte runtime it requires.",1374506355

I value the stability and depth, leading to a decent adviser to an elected PM.<p>Next, if the monarch asked something of the country as a whole, most people would take their word for it, because there would be no political motive or bias. If a PM did so, it becomes partisan and a debate. We had Blair take us to war twice on his say so. As such, most of the country opposed it and saw it was willy waving or macho-ness, or sucking up to the Americans, and so on. Had the Queen believed in it and come out and said something like, &quot;Look, Im sorry, but with 60 odd years of experience, we have no choice&quot;, I think the country would have backed her, if only reluctantly. But the Brits would have thought, &quot;bloody hell, she speaks, and well, OK&quot;. And that would be because of the huge constitutional risk doing so would have caused.<p>Finally, we could in the UK vote in something like a Nazi party. We could then take to the streets and have a violent revolution and kill the nazi&#x27;s. After all that, the Monarch would still be there as a shield of stability for both us internally, an as an external sort of front. Having won our revolution, Queenie would still be there, and ask the winner, &quot;Ok, now what?&quot;<p>I prefer all this to every other presidential system, most notable the insane US presidential race.

I dont think they need so many homes and hangers on. All that can be up for grabs, no problem. But at it core, I personally, prefer our monarch to any other alternative.<p>Sorry, but I do not believe that a vote is a universally good thing. Mostly, yes. But not an absolute. Here in the UK I firmly relive we have the two almost perfectly balanced. Democracy can do anything it likes, under a safe shield of our monarchy. If it ever got real nasty and extreme, the monarch can shut it down. We would have a crisis in that case, but we would not go Nazi, or something.

But as you might know, during the Cold War Germany was partitioned into two separate countries, and while welfare programs were present back then did exist they didn&#x27;t actually transfer money between the two countries.  And since West Germany was much richer than East Germany, this meant that everyone in East Germany was relatively poor.  Back when West Germany was much wealthier than East Germany the inhabitants had higher IQs than East Germans, but nowadays this is no longer true.  Hence, evidence that wealth causes IQ differences.<p>Now, it might be that communism was crushing the hope of East Germans or something.  That could also explain this particular difference.  But we can measure social mobility and people&#x27;s beliefs in social mobility across countries and see if it makes a difference.  And as far as I can tell it doesn&#x27;t, since social mobility and believe in social mobility are lower in most places today than they were in 1960, but the Flynn effect[1] continues to march on.<p>Having beliefs is nice and complex beliefs like those put us humans way above the vast majority of the lifeforms on this planet.  But as someone pursing a PhD I would hope that you would examine the implications of your beliefs and test those implications against reality.<p>And IQ does have predictive power with respect to income[2], though not as strongly as other factors.<p>[1]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect</a>\n [2]en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient#Income",1374505514

So let&#x27;s say that my Player is now allowed to collect Rice, which he will use in certain eat() functions.<p>If Player is a data structure, I could add the rice counter to the Player and then modify all of my functions to &quot;pass through&quot; the rice. If the game is small enough, this makes the most sense. This is <i>not as bad as it sounds</i> because the typechecker will get angry about any Player functions in the code which do not have rice. So I&#x27;ve got the language on my side when I want to &quot;make sure I&#x27;ve got all of them,&quot; it&#x27;s not just a haphazard grep for the token &quot;Player&quot;.<p>I could also write everything dogmatically with a pattern matching syntax which passes through all of the rest of the data. This is embodied in the examples below so I won&#x27;t re-write it.<p>On the other hand, I can treat the game as a module, create a <i>new</i> data structure `PlayerWithRice {player :: Player, rice :: Int}`. Then I can define `addRice :: (Player -> Player) -> PlayerWithRice -> PlayerWithRice` which takes a function for modifying players without rice, and turns it into a function for modifying players with. Then there&#x27;s just a list of new declarations in a new module which add rice to existing code.<p>This all sounds complicated! Surely there&#x27;s something simpler? There are a few simpler ideas: one is called a <i>Monad Transformer</i>. The Player can be stored in a slightly more complicated way at first, so that it &quot;wraps&quot; another object which holds &quot;all future data-to-be-added&quot;. All of your existing code written in this context will just automatically pass this &#x27;future&#x27; data through. For PlayerWithRice you simply fill in the &#x27;future&#x27; data as a data structure which holds rice and also more future data.<p>Second, there are lenses, which the above article discusses. If you write every set/get with lenses, then updating the data structure only requires updating those lenses, and all the rest of the code will follow. Again, you&#x27;ll have a type-checker on your side to guarantee that you didn&#x27;t miss anything crazy when you update those lenses.",1374505421

However:<p>&quot;Since Go is a compiled language, binaries of your app can be precompiled for each platform that you wish to distribute for.&quot;<p>For me, this is worse. There&#x27;s no audit trail. No way for me to verify that the binary of your app is the same as the source you provide. So there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m running your binary on my system. I simply cannot trust it with my user account.<p>Not only is this bad from a security perspective, it&#x27;s also bad for maintenance. Over time, many end up in a situation where others cannot rebuild binaries from source at all, since binary distribution becomes the norm and the source->binary mechanism isn&#x27;t maintained except on the developer&#x27;s own system. Look at the Java community for an example of this. This is a problem because it means that others cannot easy be a member of the community working on the source.<p>If you want to promote a community around the source (like Github does), you must also provide an easy way to rebuild binaries from the source.<p>Unfortunately, there&#x27;s no good answer here.<p>Distributions like Debian have solved this problem - there are source packages, and there&#x27;s a standard way of building them to get the binary packages. But there&#x27;s quite a bit of arcane crud that&#x27;s built up over the years, making it difficult to learn and understand Debian packaging. And the solution isn&#x27;t cross platform.<p>Each language community has produced their own solution (Rubygems, Python eggs, CPAN, etc) but none of them work with the packaging provided by any other language. To me, this may be cross platform, but not being cross language is just as big a problem.",1374505398

In all honesty, it&#x27;s just as simple as setting up Wordpress. Drop the Piwik folder on a server somewhere, run the installation (connecting to your database and if I recall correctly you don&#x27;t need to use the root user, just a user with sufficient privileges), and you&#x27;re done.<p>I want to love Piwik, and I do like it a lot, but I do have some problems. Piwik gets slow after a while. This may have to do with the server its running on partly but over time the software will slow down especially if you try to pull out somewhat longer date ranges.<p>It isn&#x27;t as pretty as GA. I know this is petty and that its themeable but the UI was important to me. Keeping it up to date and maintaining it was also something that requires vigilance. It isn&#x27;t hard to update but you have to make sure to check for updates. Sounds simple but you&#x27;d be surprised how lazy one can be. Also, integration with Webmaster Tools isn&#x27;t available which is kind of a bummer.<p>On the plus side there&#x27;s very little that GA offers that Piwik doesn&#x27;t. There&#x27;s even a great mobile app which GA doesn&#x27;t yet have to my knowledge. You can monitor multiple sites on different servers using a simple JavaScript snippet just like GA, and it breaks down the data in just about every way you&#x27;d want.<p>In the end, despite really wanting to use Piwik long term I wasn&#x27;t able to do it. I don&#x27;t see a problem with using Google Analytics for tracking purposes. Google has the power to abuse the data they collect but I trust them not to. I&#x27;m not running a site where visitor privacy is a big priority. If I were running such a site I&#x27;d reconsider this position. But from an ethical standpoint if it&#x27;s somehow not okay for Google to collect tracking data on your visitors (and promise not exploit it) why is it okay for any of us to use Piwik and collect that data ourselves. Google has far more data that can do far more damage but they also have far more resources to put into security than most of us. I can take a pledge not to exploit my user&#x27;s data but Google does too? I know I can trust myself but my users don&#x27;t. My users might even prefer that if I were to use analytics software that I use software that comes from Google, a name they know and trust, rather than me, a guy who they know a little bit but doesn&#x27;t have a reputation that can even remotely compete with Google. To me, that&#x27;s the more interesting aspect of Piwik. The question of why running your own anaytics software is more ethical than using Google.<p>Edit: When I said I wasn&#x27;t running a site that made visitor privacy a priority I was excluding the site I run that actually does make user privacy a huge priority. I&#x27;m aware I look like a hypcrite now and I think I might actually spend some time thinking of whether or not to switch over to a self-hosted analytics solution for that site. I&#x27;m still not sure that a self-hosted service is preferable in my case but I&#x27;m open to the idea.",1374505225

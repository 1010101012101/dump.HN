3584802,comment,3583719,3584737,1,0,yason,,,"The VLC GUI is sort of a mess. I think it's QT but many QT applications look just fine in Gnome. VLC doesn't. The keyboard shortcuts sometimes work, sometimes they don't: obviously a focus thing or something. The looks is different and somehow old. Various widgets aren't standard and don't always work in a standard way. For some damn reason, VLC toggles the state of the super key which I use for many keyboard shortcuts, and this means typing text doesn't work if VLC is running. Moving back and forth is cumbersome: you just can't use the arrow keys but you have to use shift and or ctrl/alt. Those can theoretically be configured but my VLC hasn't believed my new keybindings for years. The popup menus flicker when opened during a movie and they can go really deep. Changing some settings in mid-play causes restarting the movie from beginning while some settings are lost after switching DVD titles/chapters.<p>There's undoubtedly a lot of functionality in VLC but I kind of prefer the way of the Gnome school: things should be simple by default, and advanced configuration can be arranged in some advanced way, if needed. For example, transcoding into a file could be just a ""Save as..."" with a simple selection of formats. Now it opens a complex dialog with several tabs all over. Using that monster I don't always manage to reliably produce transcoded video files with VLC that generally open in any other player, and <i>at least I know something</i> about video encoding and container formats. Even opening a DVD disk requires clicking through a dialog whereas Totem just... well, starts playing whatever disk happens to be in the drive.<p>On the other hand, the quality and robustness of VLC is outstanding.\nA simple, Gnome compliant GUI plugin for vlc would make it a true pleasure.",1329123393

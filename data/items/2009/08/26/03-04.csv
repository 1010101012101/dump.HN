786529,comment,785601,785833,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"Most problem domains (or shall I more appropriately call them business domains?) have a small number of key abstractions that are crucial to understanding the domain.  Coupling these abstractions with the right relationships between them is the essence of modeling the system in which a problem occurs and a solution is desirable.  The key abstractions are going to be the same more or less irrespective of what your specific system in that problem domain will try to do.<p>Now, depending on what type of system you end up wanting to build (a real-time monitoring system, a web-based reporting tool, etc.), you will end up introducing other abstractions that represent computer science/software engineering knowledge.  However, these will only supplement and not replace the abstractions that are rooted in the problem domain.<p>In short, if you see the solution domain as distinct from the problem domain, you will run into trouble with your system design.",1251258954

In the last 90s, most people assumed that dating websites was a ""winner take all market"" and Match.com had won it, until a swath of niche competitors arose (e.g. Jdate) that succeeded because certain groups of people tend to date others from that same group.  Real-life networks are often very different from the idealized, uniformly distributed networks pictured in economics textbooks.

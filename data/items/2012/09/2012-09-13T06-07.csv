4515093,comment,4494739,4495479,1,0,CrankyPants,,,"Books: Time seems unrelenting enough that I'm not interested in reading tens of books about bands whose music I don't already love. Thanks for the suggestion, though.<p>I'm related to a serious (professional and quite successful at it) musician, with an incredibly solid background in jazz, and he can't explain why he's so head-over-heels for the Beatles. He's tried, to no end, but it usually goes along the lines of, ""they were just so...perfect. Every sound, every little thing, they just had something that nobody else has."" Plus all the standard stuff of, ""they're incredibly influential!"", which thing I don't deny, though I don't find it sufficiently satisfying a response, either. I don't mean to trivialize influence, but influence isn't, by definition, inherently good. For all I know, we'd have better music now if it weren't for them. (The argument for that is easier than it might be for some other influential songwriters, but getting into that isn't my intent.)<p>Social bookmarking: I asked why I ""should,"" not why I ""have to."" Important distinction. Mine was an invitation for smart people (which tend to be in longer supply on this site than on many others) who tend to have reasoned tastes to try to explain to me why they're fans. Saying the records are ""fabulous"" is fine, but: why? Say it's wholly a matter of taste, and I'm OK with that, but then I don't understand why so many Beatles fan act like I'm the antichrist for not being madly in love with their music. It happens pretty often that, in this pop culture, someone expects me to love some Beatles song/Cirque show/something as much as they do, and upon the discovery that I don't, they usually presume that I'm some kind of insane. Which seems odd, if it's all just a matter of taste. But if it isn't, I'd like reasoned answers (and this thread is not without some good contributions).",1347519494

Unless one knows someone working in the group, you are going off of impressions formed off information through interviewing, possible external contacts, and the like.  I do think you need to factor in what you are used to into the equation.

Coworkers - you need to do the homework, find connections, references, etc.
Environment is probably the hardest to evaluate -- asking questions will get you some answers - but has the company/group been through any challenges?  If not, how can you gauge that?  How will management react?  This is a risk.<p>You raise some great questions.<p>In my case, quality was probably a slight plus, environment (counting commute) a wash to slight negative, coworkers (a wash to some unknowns).

Shame that isn't part of their legacy.<p>Edit: I should add that I think there's something to be said for the idea of hitting that sweet spot of timing where you're not the first to do something, but you also didn't come along after everyone and their dog did it. Executing well just as the relationship between the category and a much wider audience reaches a certain viability. What springs quickly to mindforgive me that these aren't defended, or if they're just lousy examples I'd retract upon even a little bit of thoughtperhaps Facebook, Nokia's early-2000 phones, the iPhone, the iPod, Rock Band, and so on. Not the first in the space, but they executed well enough (often even better than that; I'm not saying all of the above executed only well enough), just as the category was finally becoming mature enough to fan out beyond its original market, with the product even perhaps hastening that expansion by virtue of the quality of execution.<p>That is to take nothing away from the strength of the product, but the strength of the product also shouldn't take away from the effects of ideal timing. I think many die-hard fans of anything would have a knee-jerk reaction to saying that lucky timing played a big role in that thing's success, but it's probably reality, and should also be OK to say without people assuming you're denigrating the thing in question.",1347517491

4515023,comment,4513631,4513936,2,0,tsahyt,,,"I think a good C programmer should have a grasp on how assembly works. This can come in incredibly handy for debugging weird errors. Yes there are bugs that are weird enough to only become evident in assembly code. An understanding of assembly also makes memory management and pointers in C so much more understandable. Also, assembly reveals quite a bit about performance: Less instructions == faster code. Then there are some platform-specific things that aren't available[1] from C (at least the standard library) like SSE or MMX instructions. These can give you a <i>big</i> speedup (think of it as ""micro-parallelization"") if used correctly. Some things in glibc (mainly in string.h) are implemented using them, but as far as I know the standard library doesn't provide an interface to them and the compiler usually isn't smart enough to use them when appropriate. So if you're trying to squeeze the last bit of performance out of a program you'll often have no choice but implementing a bit of assembly code as well.<p>Concerning architecture: One might argue it's not neccessary but I think a <i>good</i> C programmer should at least have scratched the surface here. No deep understanding, but a bit of an overview of what's going on. That is - I think - the point where it no longer concerns you as a programmer. Architecture and Assembly really go hand in hand, since every architecture comes with its own assembly code (yes I know, some assemblers are abstracting that away sometimes). That is why some things work faster on, say SPARC than on x86. It also helps understand the limits we're given and what ""64 bit"" <i>really</i> means.<p>Understanding architecture doesn't really help writing better C code, but it explains things the compiler does, since in a pipelined architecture, the compiler will arrange assembly instructions, so there are as little stalls as possible and therefore gaining performance.<p>[1] I might be wrong on that though. Please correct me if I am.",1347517244

I have seen quite a few of these drugs started in acutely psychotic patients, post-operative trauma patients, chronic pain patients, etc, etc. These portraits strike me more as visual expressions of the preconceptions a layperson has about a variety of meds. People come in with all sorts of preconceptions about what they're going to get out of a prescription. Part of my job is getting them from where their preconceptions are to where they need to be.<p>Have I taken all these drugs? No. I've taken a few ambien on trans-Pacific flights, I've had some opioids after surgery. I've dealt with patients taking them or seeking them. Some were sick. Some of them, really sick. Some are 20-year-old grocery store cashiers with low cut shirts and miniskirts, all dolled up, trying to score some xanax on a Saturday for the next rave, pissed when I disappoint them.<p>My favorite is cephalexin. It's an antibiotic. Most of the side effects are associated with the molecular biology of bactericide. That one verges on pure farce.<p>Another one that makes my spidy-sense go off is the wild divergence between representations in response to opioids. They're just not that different, especially when compared to the differences with other classes psychotropics in the set.<p>If some random stranger came up to me on the street and said they had a plan like this, I'd probably say ""It's a free country.

It's forgotten by all but diehards 10-20 years later. At least a good movie or book lasts hundreds of years.<p>To say sport is more than that is quite sad I feel, people need to get over pretending it that important.",1347516284

Unless you're working on a very old machine or a low-spec embedded system, this shouldn't make much practical difference.<p>""< some-file.txt | wc -l"" doesn't work for me.  ""< some-file.txt wc -l"" does.  I actually wasn't aware of the latter syntax; and now that I think about it, I'm actually not sure if I've ever used redirection in combination with piped commands.<p>(I don't do a whole lot of shell scripting, and I exclusively used DOS, Windows, and OS/2 during my most formative years, so my reflex is to reach for an actual programming language to do nontrivial things, because even though I've been using Linux for years as my main OS, the fact that I now have a competent shell available still hasn't completely sunk in.  I was amazed when I discovered the xargs command and its --max-procs option; I'd written a Python script to do much the same thing.)",1347516262
4514977,comment,4513631,4514658,4,0,exDM69,,,"> A bug in C caused an alignment issue? That's pretty surprising to me. That should be abstracted from the programmer. If it was written in assembly, it makes sense, though.<p>Memory alignment in C is most definitely not abstracted from the programmer. The compiler does add some padding to fit alignments but they can either work for you or against you. 98% of the time it works the way you want it but when it goes wrong, it's going to be a hard problem to debug. So it's absolutely critical for a C programmer to know a thing or two about alignment, especially the cases where the compiler <i>attempts</i> to fix it for you.<p>Examples of alignments that can have a performance effect or in some scenarios (multithreading, kernel programming) may affect the correctness of the program: 4 bytes (word size), 8 bytes (64b pointer size), 16 bytes (SSE/NEON SIMD register size), 32 bytes (ARM cache line size, AVX SIMD register), 128 bytes (ARM and x86 cache line size), 4k (ARM and x86 page size). Add relevant figures for any other target archs you're dealing with.<p>When doing GPU work (using glMapBufferRange or something), there are other alignments to care about and they may be GPU-specific. Aligning everything to 2^N can never hurt.",1347516224

Other influential writers, like Jeff Atwood, make exactly the same mistake[1].

We've been slow on making the decision to move to a different open source implementation because it is difficult to test this kind of software.  I mean, ActiveMQ appears to work fine in tests, but in production, lock-ups and storage leaks happen on monthy basis.  We need simple functionality, peristent queues in their simplest form.  HornetQ seems like a good candidate.  I'd appreciate if anyone could share their experience with it.",1306475888

Indeed, some of what compilers do in register allocation (and maybe cache usage) will be too difficult for hand coded assembler.<p>More generally, now the execution time of a small, single threaded program is nearly never of much concern.

2590523,comment,2588185,2590461,4,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Absolutely - I need batch loads, and random reads. The term ""insert"" is somewhat meaningless - I have random appends and a periodic mapreduce job compiles the randomly appended data into structured data to served via ElephantDB. The structured data requires random queries. In principle, HBase should have filled my needs completely. But in practice, I couldn't make it work.<p>Our HBase cluster (3 boxes serving 30 human oracles, each submitting data at a rate of 1 record every 5-10 seconds) choked frequently - i.e., it stopped accepting new records. Ultimately what I had to do is have the human data go into postgres and a cron job flushed that into HBase every half hour or so.<p>I'll emphasize that this is probably my fault. I'm not claiming HBase doesn't scale to 30 concurrent users - clearly Facebook demonstrates it can. But I couldn't figure out how to make that happen. HBase is a complex system and I make no claim of understanding it.<p>ElephantDB + MaryJane are simple. There is almost nothing that can go wrong - put together they probably amount to 5000 lines of code and have as many as 10 minimally interacting configuration options. The effort required to manage them is minimal - I had EDB working flawlessly in less than a day.<p>HBase is an enterprise tool. It works well if you are Facebook and can put a couple of people on maintenance duty. It's overkill if you are Styloot (my stealth mode startup, currently smaller than Backtype).",1306473993

The kind of New Yorker that just can't see himself living anywhere else, even the vaunted Silicon Valley or SF in general no matter the opportunity (so take this with the appropriate grain of salt). In fact, NYC has been nurturing an interesting tech scene which has just started getting ""noticed"" in the last two or so years but obviously has been here much longer before that. I think there are a number of conflated reasons for this. NYC is the nerve center for a number of industries not only in the US but internationally as well. There are many types of startups happening here but let's delve into a few that immediately come to mind. Healthcare and Biotech, Media/Entertainment/Music, Commerce, Fashion, Finance, and Government.<p>NYC has one of the best ratios of hospital beds to patients in the entire country. There are a huge number of medical institutions in the five boroughs not only serving a huge variety of patients but also performing a tremendous amount of research. I work at one of those institutions and I can tell you that if they weren't looking to capitalize on/spin off their in-house tech, they are now.<p>Media and Entertainment. All the major players have HQ's here and where they are so are startups trying to sell them goods and services. Boxee comes to mind (as an innovator and a partner). I dunno where to put Meetup, but I'll put em here.<p>Commerce. Gilt Group, Etsy, etc.<p>Fashion. Clothia, Warby Parker.<p>Finance. The money is here and half the players on Wall Street are looking to get off the Street and start a business with the right technical talent. Not to mention innovation in the trading and hedge fund space.<p>Government. Mayor Bloomberg is really pushing municipal data as a platform. Check out the NYC DataMine and places like OpenPlans. NYCBigApps is a contest (two years running) for developers to take advantage of municipal data for the betterment of the City and maybe make a few bucks/put a business together in the process. This is only going to grow and I expect some great things to come of it.<p>There are also tech plays like 10gen, Nodejitsu, various tech incubators like BetaWorks and K2 and cooperative groups like GeneralAssembly and NYHacker.<p>What I find interesting about the tech scene in NYC is that in addition to R&D there is a huge amount of applied technology due to the confluence of talent and industries. The stuff that is getting made out here has a revenue model out the gate because they are re-imagining and re-inventing pre-existing business with technology as a corner stone. At the end of the day, let's face it, people want to be here in NYC. You know what they say - If you can make it here...",1306472445

I agree it's horrible to use e.g. ""if (i&lt;10)""  <i>are you kidding me?</i> Though, many people use a graphical front end to generate it these days (mapforce, biztalk mapper, stylus studio, IBM and Oracle have their own - there's even a free one with an online demo \n<a href=""http://jamper.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jamper.sourceforge.net/</a>).<p>I think several healthy businesses supplying a GUI for XSLT suggests two things: 1. there's a need for what XSLT does; and 2. XSLT sucks<p>Of course, it could be that GUIs indicate a kind of disruption - making a difficult technology simpler to use, and therefore accessible by less-skilled people (or skilled people with less time). The potential disruptees are the XSLT experts (who in turn displaced people who wrote manual transformers, before XSLT).<p>Having said all that: there isn't anything comparable for JSON. And yet, communication between different apps - or even communication between different versions of the same app - is pretty much a given.",1306472402

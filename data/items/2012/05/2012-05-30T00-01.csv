4040802,comment,4038939,4038939,1,0,jhuni,,,"A quick note on sigils: recently I have been thinking that the dollar sign sigil could be used to denote place forms such that $_ is the top place form. Any place form could be cast into a function to be used on any object, for example you could use the place form $first on a collection like &$first(coll) and you could always set the value of a place with something like setf($first, 1).<p>Inside any function $_ will refer to the argument of the function, so you could program without ever using named parameters like in Perl 5. A parameters list like ($x,$y,$z) will just create new place forms rather then variables. I think this would make for a pretty interesting programming language semantics. On the other hand, I don't see much use for the @ and % sigils because I just consider lists to be structures with numeric places and maps to be structures with general places, so I actually prefer PHP style sigils.",1338339098

Then again, it was pretty beta code.<p>I'll also add that I'm no fan of GNOME's bug-for-bug compatible reimplementation of the Windows Registry through gconf.  At least the underlying data are <i>slightly</i> more accessible, but it's still a massive festering boil.<p>One system that I find works pretty well is WindowMaker.  Configuration is through a set of textfiles, but most functionality is exposed through a pretty slick configuration utility.  Since all of this is based on Steve Jobs's NeXT interface, I'm not overly surprised that it works pretty well most of the time.<p>When I configure a new desktop/laptop, I just port over the GNUstep directory.  Every 6-12 months I may tweak a configuration setting, usually through the GUI utility.  But if I want to I've got the full functionality exposed through files.<p>A realization I had a few weeks back is that GUIs are ultimately limited in their surface area and dimensionality.  There's only so much functionality they can expose, and in any sufficiently rich interface, some stuff will be buried deeply, and inevitably, two configurations you'll want or need to tune together will be in utterly different branches of the config menus/interface.<p>With a CLI, all dimensions are uniform.  If the interface is sufficiently broken, you can write a wrapper around it (a classic example is rlwrap, a readline wrapper around other commands, such as Oracle's utterly broken CLI SQL client).  I'll frequently write one-off shell functions to put the argument I want to tweak at the end of a command line to make readline bash editing easier and more convenient.<p>Granted, this is power-user stuff, but it's what makes the shell environment so damned powerful and flexible.",1338338928

I don't have a formal reference to hand, but this is discussed in the last chapter of Stumbling on Happiness - I can dig up the reference if required. Basically, what seems to happen is that having kids leads to many really extreme experiences - first steps, first words, as well as the sort of terrible experiences talked about in this article. We tend to remember these extreme experiences, particularly the good ones, much more than washing nappies every day, and that leads people to report a level of happiness that isn't borne out if you get them to record how happy they are at random times on random days where they're much more likely to be washing nappies.<p>None of which really matters, of course. If you want kids you'll probably love having them, and if you don't you'll probably be happier without them.",1338338226

This is actually a big problem and relates to the nullability problem, explained at: <a href=""http://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/15/boolean-blindness/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/15/boolean-blin...</a><p>For example, in C:<p><pre><code>  switch(ptr) {
  case NULL: ... handle null case ...
  default: ... use ptr as if it weren't NULL ...
  }
</code></pre>
This is unsafe -- because nothing prevents you from using ptr in the ""NULL"" case, and the compiler does not give you anything in the non-NULL case.<p>In Haskell:<p><pre><code>  case ptr of
    Nothing -> ... can't use ptr as a value here,
                   it's wrapped with Maybe ...
    Just x -> ... pattern-matching gave us ""x"" of

4040688,comment,4037645,4039600,12,0,ken,,,"Unfortunately, I think you're imagining a fantasy vehicle: your requirements are pretty much in direct conflict with each other.<p>The smaller the vehicle, the less it can rely on passive safety (crashing better), and the more it has to rely on its advantages at active safety (avoiding crashing).  You can't cheat physics: a tiny personal vehicle is never going to have passive safety as good as a midsize car.  Even relatively safe compact cars like the Toyota Yaris don't have 5-star crash ratings, so I don't see how a 2-wheeler ever will.<p>Motorcycles are dangerous primarily because (a) small fast vehicles tend to attract more than their share of irresponsible people (which, not uncommonly, includes alcohol), and (b) car drivers have trouble seeing tiny vehicles.  I don't see how this vehicle proposes to change either of these factors.",1338336752

If somebody doesn't make a stand soon, Apple is just going to keep shitting on you. Once Dev ID launches, and OSX becomes a walled garden just like iOS, the exact same stuff is going to happen. If Apple doesn't like you or wants what you have, they will simply shut you out.

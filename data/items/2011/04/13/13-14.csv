2442191,comment,2442149,2442149,4,0,BigglesZX,,,"I've toyed with this question myself during a recent job search. I loathe traditional job sites as they're usually filled with recruitment agency guff, vacuous job descriptions that often fail to mention salary, location, and so on.<p>For me at least, the most important things I want to know about a company are unfortunately often the hardest to quantify: what's it like to work there, what's the atmosphere like, what sort of clients do they have and what sort of new work do they like to attract? My paramount concern is fitting in, having fun and getting excited about work every morning, because that's the only way I'll get out of bed.<p>I came up with a list of things that I'd have as rules on my ""perfect job site"", and they including things like ""must mention actual company name (not just the recruitment agency)"", ""must give accurate location"", ""must give accurate salary"" ('competitive' doesn't mean anything - competitive with whom?) and ""must include job title"". Too often do I read postings and come away with no idea of what I would actually be <i>doing</i> if I were to take that job!<p>Hope that helps!<p>Edit: I'd also say describing the size of the company is important to me. I'm looking to move up the ladder right now and that involves only considering companies above (say) 20 people. I went to an interview a couple of weeks ago for a company with a very nice website indeed - they came across very well indeed and had lots of interesting clients - but I discovered that I was to be employee #4. Great guys, but I wouldn't have gone along if I'd known that up front, and saved everyone some time.",1302703176

Why bother typing out a 5 paragraph comment on your thoughts on the article when you can just contribute to that pun thread or just post a quick one liner? In a forum where jokes are encouraged, they tend to take over the actual discussion. Pretty much anyone can contribute to a joke thread (especially when the bar is as low as just repeating memes), but not everyone can hold an actual discussion. Thus, you wind up with a lot more joking about a topic, and very little actual discussion. It vastly decreases the signal to noise ratio.

If you want to do well in your classes, you should be able to dedicate at least an hour or so outside of class to studying and homework for every hour of lecture time that you have. That gives you time to really get into the material and reinforce it in your own way.<p>Otherwise, you'd have to make a lot of compromises with things like hobbies, socializing and networking, mastery of the material, and even your personal health.<p>A good hobby and some socializing will ward off depression and keep you feeling upbeat and motivated. Friends can also support you when you're down. This is key to preventing burn outs.<p>Networking will give you the contacts you need to find opportunities to apply what you learn in school -- otherwise all you can do is apply to open job offers and try to compete resume to resume against all the other recent graduates many of whom will look exactly like you on paper.<p>A mastery of the material in earlier courses will make the future coursework and material much easier to grasp and work through. You can't do this if you're juggling too many courses and constantly worrying about grades. Think of it as a feedback loop -- the harder you make it to master the earlier course material, the harder the remaining courses will become. Learn to make the difficulty curve work for you, not against you.<p>Finally, maintaining your personal health will allow you to live a longer, better life. You'll look better, feel better, and more importantly, think better. You're young, so yes, you can bounce back from a bad year or two, but get into a habit of taking good care of yourself now and never compromise on it. You'll thank yourself later.<p>Personally, I wouldn't compromise on any of these points for more than a year or two. You may get ahead in one aspect, only to set yourself back in another.<p>So don't be afraid to slow down. Burning out and getting in over your head will make your life miserable and difficult, but one extra year of school can make the next twenty years of your life that much easier.",1302701573

I was in a discussion with a prominent user here and noticed that every one of his comments would shoot up 4-5 points within seconds of being submitted while mine would go down as many points.<p>In a later thread, around a month ago, I intentionally requested the page as frequently as I could to measure comment scores, and found that this users comments were spiking up to the top of the thread within a minute.<p>Comment counts are also self-perpetuating, which you have fixed now, but it would mean that with multi-account a simple 2-3 votes would spike a comment up with further votes from other user (eg. 'if he has had 4 votes in 8 minutes this comment must be good' - groupthink)<p>Multi-accounting should be easy to fix with IP tracking and some smarts (ie.

You always have to code recursive programs defensively.<p>A program coded like ""recurse(n-1)"" will probably blow its lid if you pass in 1,000,000 as the parameter while ""for (i=0; i<N; i++)"" will happily chug away a billion times. Or worse, if you call ""recurse(n-1)"" twice in the same function and then pass in a measly value of 100 as the parameter, you will be waiting for the program to terminate on your deathbed.<p>Explaining why these differences are important to a beginning student, let alone teaching them how to avoid them on their own, is a task that can only get in the way.

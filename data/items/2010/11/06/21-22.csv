That is, even though I like getting feedback when I describe my startup to other meeting participants, when the majority of the attendees at a tech meetup are other entrepreneurs (i.e. not investors), at the end of the day, all the feedback in the world from fellow entrepreneurs is not as impactful as feedback from a seasoned investor. It seems everyone is there pitching their own startup and not really interested in your startup. So the chit-chat and exchange of ideas is great, but most often leads to nowhere.<p>I can see some potential benefits from such meetups, even if everyone else is there promoting their own startup:<p>* If you talk to enough companies, you may find some synergies between your startup and someone else's, and so you can pursue some collaborations<p>* If you talk to enough people, you'll find someone who knows someone who would be interested in working with you or investing in you.<p>* You get to meet people, and after seeing them at enough events, get to know them, so in the future, if you are looking for someone to hire, or some company to work for, this could be a good route to find one.<p>Do you guys see other benefits that I'm missing?<p>What's your experience with meetups that are very startup-founder-heavy? What value do you derive from them?",1289078401

What I am saying is that Apple thinks of the iPhone, iPod, and iPad as three different containers for the same thing rather than as three wholly independent product lines. I don't see how that's controversial or unusual, and the existence of Android media players and tablets is evidence that this thinking is not unique to Apple. It's not clear that Schmidt's 200,000 activations/day figure excluded such devices, either, nor do I think it should.<p><i>Analysts want to compare the number of Android phones vs. the number of iPhones sold. Apple is intentionally withholding that data because it makes them look bad and is instead talking only iOS numbers.</i><p>Nonsense. The quarterly sales figures for the iPhone were stated twice in the very same call (the transcript linked above). It's also <i>very</i> hard to believe that Jobs is afraid that the iPhone being out-sold by the sum of all Android phones makes Apple look bad when he even said so himself in the same call:<p>""[...] Android is our biggest competitor. They out-shipped us in the June quarter as we were transitioning to iPhone 4. They out-shipped us for the first time according to Gartner's numbers, which we think are pretty accurate.""",1289078299

When we'd tried out Hibernate for a past employer, performance dropped by 80% - data operations were now taking <i>5x</i> as long to complete.  You can recover much of that by tuning your mappings, but by then, you're pretty much writing SQL anyway, and your app wouldn't work with any database other than the one you tuned for.<p>Also, nearly every app needs its own data abstraction layer, one that works with the particular operations and domain objects of the app rather than tuples and records and tables.

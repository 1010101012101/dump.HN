Apart from the students who already used Linux, who just argued over which distribution, the CS students who'd only been exposed to Windows unanimously expressed they hated Linux.  I asked them why, what was wrong, and it always came back to the fact that it was unfamiliar.  I'm not sure how you fix that, because in effect their gripe was that it was not ""exactly like Windows"".  It's yet another bad effect of the Microsoft monopoly - people believe that Computer == Windows, because they don't get exposed to anything else.",1209401963

175754,comment,175604,175739,0,0,aflag,,,"Proprietary software is not evil, is just bad for society. Or at least not as good as free software.<p>I don't like that kind of behaviour from ubuntu, such as offering restricted drivers and suggesting for the user the installation of proprietary codecs -- I've been told it does that, I might be wrong. That's supporting the use of proprietary software, which I don't think shouldn't be the goal of any GNU/Linux distribution. In that sense I only wish ubuntu has less support for proprietary software, not more.<p>The thing that should attract people into GNU/Linux is the free software philosophy. If they're going to use GNU/Linux without even worrying about what free software is, then I don't care at all if they are using it or not. Why should anyone involved in free software development care about people who doesn't care about free software? Why should I care about someone who doesn't even make an effort in trying to stay away from non-free software, unless they have absolutely no choice?<p>Ubuntu doesn't ship with Flash to the convenience of the users who want to use free software -- so they don't have to uninstall it (or worse, use it without realising it's non-free).",1209401680

175751,comment,175604,175669,0,0,coffeeaddicted,,,"It's certainly part of the story. But even after using (and mostly loving) Gimp now for years I still dislike the way it opens each image in an own window, especially when working with lots of open images. I can't just hide all gimp-windows in the background when switching tools - I have to hide each image one-by-one. Usually it's easier hiding all desktop windows and bringing up the other application I need afterwards. What irritates me even more is when I have to hunt for the tools-window of gimp \nbehind some of my images.<p>But I don't know if Photoshop would be nicer in that regard , I haven't used that in a long time.",1209401447

Bought by Verisign for $500m, allowing its founder (Mark Shuttleworth) to become the 2nd paid space tourist, to create an early-stage VC called HBD, and to move on to things like Canonical (Ubuntu Linux).  At the time, played differently, it could have been Thawte that bought Verisign (but Mark did not have an interest in that).<p>IIRC he is based from the UK these days (in part because of tax reasons), but very much maintains his ties to Africa.  And Thawte is still based out of Cape Town.<p>Arguably, all the ""negatives"" actually have an advantage, and African hackers can actually get to be really good -- because the environment forces them to innovate and be creative.  (Which is why they can do things like build LEO microsatellites for under $5m -- eg <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUNSAT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUNSAT</a>).<p>There are of course several cases of (ex)-Africans founding successful companies in the USA (Paypal being a notable example) -- which is admittedly a little different.<p>Arguably environment is just another ""tool"" in the entrepreneur's toolbox -- some will gain advantage by changing environment, others by exploiting uniqueness in theirs and finding ways to deal with the challenges.<p>An interesting comment made once by Mark Shuttleworth, was that if a fashion company establishes in Paris (or a financial one in New York), it is immediately a challenge to be more than just average in that domain, to ""stand out"" as it were.

It's good that Ubuntu doesn't come with flash, it would be even better if it didn't even tell you about it. Maybe in the future it might come with gnash already installed (you may want to install it, I'm sure it's on the repositories, even my debian etch has it). For youtube specifically, as I understand the latest totem comes with a plugin that allows you to watch youtube videos directly from totem, another alternative for using youtube without flash.<p>And yes, I'm a free software extremist, who simply doesn't get it, who will forever be wrong. And I'm too radical, things can't be taken so seriously, I'll never find a girlfriend. I know all that. Still, the purpose of Ubuntu is to spread the use of free software, not to be another system offering propertary software.

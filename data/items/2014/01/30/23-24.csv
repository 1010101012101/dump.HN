7154251,comment,7153709,7153900,27,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Interesting, so its $100K in revenue per employee per quarter, that is annualized out to $400K/employee/quarter.<p>Note that it isn&#x27;t that people are being <i>paid</i> $100K per quarter, it is that <i>the business</i> generates $100K in revenue per quarter per employee. When you manage a business one generally has a model, generally that model starts with revenue - cost of goods or &quot;gross margin&quot;, in an info business like this I tend to model the Operational expense of &quot;operations&quot; (the folks who run the server, the cost of IP transit service, co-location fees, etc) as the &quot;cost of goods&quot; (basically the amount of money you&#x27;re spending to make the product available for the customer).<p>So you start with that Gross Margin and your business model is the formulae you use to &quot;spend&quot; it. In old school tech companies you&#x27;ll spend x% of your gross margin on &quot;R&D&quot;, y% on sales, z% on customer acquisition etc. And at the end of the trough is your &quot;net profit&quot; which some folks report as free cash flow. So lets say Zynga spends 10% of their gross margin on R&D, then the money available for R&D would be $100K * GM * R&D margin. To work an example lets say Zynga&#x27;s margins are 80%, 100K * .8 * .1 is $8k/quarter available for our R&D employee during the quarter. That is not even $3k/month or $36K/year <i>loaded</i> cost (meaning their salary, benefits and office space).<p>That is why it is a useful sanity check to see what the revenue per employee is. That helps you understand how healthy (or unhealthy) the business is.  In comparison Apple has 80,000 employees and a quarterly revenue of 57B for a revenue per employee of 720K (about 7x Zynga).<p>I know boring stuff but sometimes it helps when trying to figure out if you&#x27;re making progress or not.",1391126016

7154238,comment,7152250,7152250,6,0,drewcrawford,,,"I actually wrote a promise library for iOS (and didn&#x27;t release it).  The postmortem is here: <a href=""http://sealedabstract.com/code/broken-promises/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sealedabstract.com/code/broken-promises/</a><p>The tl;dr is that you can run into trouble on the iOS platform if you don&#x27;t enforce a strict 1:1 chain of cause/effects and are very careful about the timing of adding new links to the chain.<p>This library doesn&#x27;t appear to do that, and they appear to consider this a feature, and actively push you in that direction.  For example, a bullet in the readme is that tasks are &quot;fully composable&quot; and another bullet point discusses adding new tasks to the tree on-demand.  These can work on some platforms, but iOS isn&#x27;t one of them, and so this really reads like someone familiar with JS or .NET trying to add &quot;missing&quot; functionality to iOS without considering why these patterns are not generally used on iOS.  Plus, it&#x27;s trying to achieve API similarity with Android, which is a code smell.<p>So I would really advise against using this library, at the very least use it a in a superficial way that would be easy to tear out later.  If you really want to do this promises thing, I would push you toward Reactive Cocoa, which I am also skeptical about but it&#x27;s been around much longer, seems to have a much more mature API, and I know at least some smart people who&#x27;ve used it successfully.",1391125903

I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s worthwhile. <i>It is not a viable alternative.</i><p>I&#x27;m working on a widget that other people will embed on their page. I cannot make assumptions about jQuery being available and I cannot afford to add jQuery as a dependency. Assuming the widget was valuable to you, would you want to add my widget to your page if it included 94kb (jQuery 1.10.2 minified) of JS before my code was even added on top? If you cared about performance, it&#x27;s <i>highly unlikely</i> you would.<p>So for that reason I&#x27;ve been working with plain JS for months now. We have browser support back to IE9 (maybe even 8), and our entire codebase is around 25kb minified (gzipped < 6kb). We have one or two collections of utilities, but most of it is application code that would still be there even if we had jQuery as a dependency. All I can say is it is not that big a problem. If you&#x27;re not sure how to get something to work across browsers, look at the source of jQuery (this website [0] is fantastic for this purpose) or any other library that is well regarded.<p>But you know what? Most of the time it isn&#x27;t even a problem. And with modern tools [1][2] and a good test suite, it&#x27;s not difficult testing across multiple browsers to quickly find issues.<p>Before even working on this project I decided to go on a self-administered &quot;jQuery diet&quot;. I haven&#x27;t used jQuery in any personal projects [3][4] for at least a year and it&#x27;s great. It took a little adjusting, but not much. If anything it was a little shocking. I thought I was a good JS dev, but it really opened my eyes to how little I knew about the DOM and other native browser APIs and, honestly, I felt a little ashamed.<p>Conclusion: sometimes going it alone is the right decision. jQuery is absolutely the right choice in some environments, but it doesn&#x27;t make it the right choice absolutely<p>[0] <a href=""http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://karma-runner.github.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://karma-runner.github.io</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://vanamco.com/ghostlab/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vanamco.com/ghostlab/</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/WickyNilliams/headroom.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/WickyNilliams/headroom.js</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://github.com/WickyNilliams/enquire.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/WickyNilliams/enquire.js</a>",1391125698

Just having the backup generators not come on for a short time period isn&#x27;t enough; they have to be unavailable for days or weeks, as the Fukushima ones were. Also, the switchgear has to be such that portable generators can&#x27;t be brought in and hooked up. I was extremely surprised to find that <i>all</i> of those design decisions were apparently made wrong in the Fukushima plant.<p>And even then, when put in proper perspective, the negative consequences of nuclear power are less severe, when averaged over all the kilowatt-hours of power produced by nuclear plants, than the negative consequences of other forms of energy. Coal causes far more mortality and morbidity per unit of energy generated, for example. It&#x27;s not &quot;retarded&quot; to choose a power source that has less severe side effects all things considered.<p>Again, that&#x27;s not to say that reactor designs should not be improved. But by any reasonable standard, nuclear power even with existing designs is safer, all things considered, than other major forms of energy. The only reason the public does not understand that is that &quot;radiation&quot; is a buzz word, whereas &quot;respiratory failure due to coal dust&quot;, for example, is not. (And even &quot;radiation&quot; is not used fairly; coal ash has higher levels of radioactivity than many forms of nuclear waste. But the public isn&#x27;t exhorted to protest about radiation from coal ash.)",1391125179

7154108,comment,7152068,7152068,4,0,elclanrs,,,"&quot;You might not need jQuery&quot; -- But you have to cope with ugly syntax, browser compatibility hacks, and disconnected pieces of code. By the time you re-factor all of this, make it user friendly and lower the cognitive load, you&#x27;re already re-inventing the wheel by building your own jQuery replacement, with the parts that you need.<p>The beauty of jQuery is working with the DOM as collections. I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s better to have all these helpers like `nextSibling`, `matches`, or `filter` thrown in the global scope or having to remember is this a real array? jQuery already built solutions for these common problems and exposes a nice API.<p>If all I need is querying the DOM and I don&#x27;t have to support IE8 then I may consider using vanilla JavaScript, or building my own simple jQuery-esque library. But you&#x27;d start with some structure, and expose your own API. I re-invented the DOM wheel many times, and from my experience, although the code is smaller, I end up going back to jQuery because it covers some edge case or provides something else I need, like AJAX, or nice events, etc.<p>But building your own DOM library is a good educational challenge. Querying the DOM is all about collections, and if you don&#x27;t need IE8 then you can use all the ES5 arrays methods, like map and filter. It all boils down to four functions to work with collections: toArray, unique, flatten and query. And four functions to work with the DOM: compose, join, dot, loop. See here for an example <a href=""http://jsbin.com/EgIkega/1/edit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsbin.com/EgIkega/1/edit</a>. The article is more about techniques to build your own jQuery-like library; I wouldn&#x27;t use &quot;el.nextElementSibling || nextElementSibling(el)&quot; when I can use &quot;$(el).next()&quot;.

Got ~200 points. I was planning to go back and implement this in Go to see the difference in performance but never got around to do it.<p>(2) Python. I wrote a single-threaded miner which could do around 300K hashes/s. My miner calculated 1M hashes (~3s), then fetched origin, then continued until it got a hit. I stopped after the first Gitcoin.<p>(3) Node. My solution was very simple and pretty much like the OP&#x27;s. I kept a map between IP and count and always let through IPs with count <= 4. If the count was > 4, then I let them through with 0.3 probability to keep the backends working.<p>(4) I spend most of my time on this problem, largely trying to keep the memory within the constraints. I started with Node and created a simple inverted index of all words to their positions. Since we needed substring search I had to loop through the keys of the index which was too slow. My next attempt was to index all substrings but that used too much memory. My third, and best, Node attempt was using a prefix tree to index all suffixes, effectively building a suffix tree. This was quite fast, got ~2200 on local tests but was still over the memory limits.<p>I then gave up on Node and moved to Python. I used Flask for the server and built two solutions. A simple inverted index and a prefix tree (using datrie) with all suffixes. To keep the memory footprint low, I stored file/line locations as bit-shifted longs. Amazingly, the simple index and the prefix tree performed the same (!), so I submitted the inverted index solution and got a passing score.<p>Thanks for a great week Stripe. I learned tons!

Its main problem (perhaps this was fixed already) was prevalent use of &quot;lazy I/O&quot; which is very controversial. I personally despise lazy I/O and think it violates the basic principles that make Haskell great.

Identity persistence there is secondary to community persistence, which may account for the difference. All the centralized services rely on being acommunal - a single giant network on which anyone may reach anyone. And with acommunal spaces, there is a strong &quot;free for all&quot; aspect that puts trade and monetization in the dominant position - which, besides the monopolistic aspects, leads to spam, identity theft, sockpuppeting, et al.<p>There is, perhaps, a model for reversing the overall trend through the community-persistence method; an entire community is harder to fake, thus it produces much stronger guarantees about identity.",1391123273

Delivering power via a cable, even with AC/DC conversion in the middle, is a solved problem. I can think of five Apple devices currently in use in my house that can&#x27;t share the same cable. None of them are more than seven years old. That&#x27;s nonsensical. The fact that none of them can use the same connector as other non-Apple devices merely adds to the annoyance.<p>As for MagSafe, it&#x27;s only a partial success.

Supposedly, when working on Lollipop, Google engineers left a Nexus phone running on Airplane mode, and it lasted a month on a charge. I&#x27;m not sure if it actually happened, but it&#x27;s believable. Goes to show the point that if we can manage power usage well, multi-day run times are perfectly practical without mammoth batteries.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on with it in the iOS world, but Google seems to be working on this with the power management changes in Lollipop. They still have a long way to go, since the first thing I noticed on upgrading to it was random massive battery drain for no apparent reason. It seems to have gone away since I uninstalled Foursquare, but that was a random guess, and I&#x27;m still not sure if it was the main reason. Anyways, point is that the OS-level changes to make it easier to sip power are good, but app compliance is still spotty.<p>I think that what we really need in Android is a good, OS-level way of monitoring which apps are actually causing idle wakelocks, GPS usage, and other non-obvious power drains. If the users can see that App X is what&#x27;s killing their battery, they will presumably uninstall it and yell at the App developers instead of at Google, or maybe decide that the app does actually need to do that, and it&#x27;s worth it, but at least they know it&#x27;s the app&#x27;s fault, and not Android&#x27;s. Possibly some sort of option to notify the user if an app&#x27;s idle power usage is over some threshold and ask them if they&#x27;re really okay with that.",1421002588

My wife often asks me to help with translated Microsoft software, and I tend to be at loss about what they&#x27;re trying to say. If it is in English, there&#x27;s no problem. If someone says it in slang that relies on words that come from the sound of English words, there&#x27;s no problem.",1421001914

When not the only way to get basic human dignity.<p><i>That</i> assumption is <i>old as balls</i>, and it&#x27;s hard to see it surviving the current state of technology and medicine, let alone what&#x27;s about to come.<p>So what will probably happen is that we&#x27;l keep telling people that working 40 hours a week in a job you had for the last, like, 5 years, is a basic necessity, yet that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get &#x27;em, because old people are a) living forever b) holding on to those jobs because <i>they&#x27;re a strict requirement</i> c) creating machines that do other people&#x27;s 40hrs/week jobs.<p>So yeah, now that stable, full-time work has been overloaded with all that junk, the conditions that make this paradigm possible have to be saved whenever they&#x27;re menaced. Sometimes I wonder whether I&#x27;m the only one here who thinks that the point of working is to make the world around me a better place, rather than a way to reach some kind of social status and <i>incidentally</i> keeping a relatively helpful system up and running.<p>With those prospects of limitless healthly lifespans, those limits would look like either<p>- capping the timespan people are allowed to work, so that they can&#x27;t hog those precious, limited 40hrs/week stable jobs that young folks need to get some kind of implicit economic citizenship<p>- creating demand for those, by doing the old sorta-Keynesian thing and just creating jobs. This has worked great in the past, &#x27;cause those jobs looked like building the Golden Gate, the Hoover dam, nailing down the basics of nuclear physics, getting jet engines to work, and then sending people on the freaking <i>moon</i>. But now it looks more like working as under-trained wannabe-SWAT police teams raiding teen&#x27;s bedrooms for small-time weed deals, building the like five thousandth M1-A1 the USArmy doesn&#x27;t need, and stuff like that.<p>My ideal, which I can&#x27;t even seriously hold as I watch how most governments deal with their respective economic crises, is to strip that socioeconomic status away from stable employment.<p>I picture guaranteed basic income as the very first economic stepping stone of that project. See, I would gladly accept a basic living wage to stay home, cook for my family, take care of the house, and whatever, while dedicating exactly all, and not one second more, of my daily intellectually productive work timespan to something relevant, I don&#x27;t know what.

Per Wikipedia (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto#As_plaintiff"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto#As_plaintiff</a>):<p><i>While many lawsuits involve breach of Monsanto&#x27;s Technology Agreement, farmers who have not signed this type of contract, but do use the patented seed, can also be found liable for violating Monsanto&#x27;s patent. That said, Monsanto has stated it will not &quot;exercise its patent rights where trace amounts of our patented seed or traits are present in farmer&#x27;s fields as a result of inadvertent means.&quot;  The Federal Circuit found that this assurance is binding on Monsanto, so that farmers who do not harvest more than a trace amount of Monsanto&#x27;s patented crops &quot;lack an essential element of standing&quot; to challenge Monsanto&#x27;s patents.</i><p>The closest you can come to that is <i>Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser</i> in Canada of course; in this case he selected for Roundup Ready plants, like we discussed in the recent antibiotic resistance discussion (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8852487"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8852487</a>) which is not an innocent accident.  The end of the Wikipedia Monsanto article notes:<p><i>&quot;The court record shows, however, that it was not just a few seeds from a passing truck, but that Mr Schmeiser was growing a crop of 95–98% pure Roundup Ready plants, a commercial level of purity far higher than one would expect from inadvertent or accidental presence. The judge could not account for how a few wayward seeds or pollen grains could come to dominate hundreds of acres without Mr Schmeiser’s active participation, saying ‘...none of the suggested sources could reasonably explain the concentration or extent of Roundup Ready canola of a commercial quality evident from the results of tests on Schmeiser’s crop’&quot; – in other words, the original presence of Monsanto seed on his land in 1997 was indeed inadvertent, but the crop in 1998 was entirely purposeful.</i>",1421000763

Percy Schmeiser, the farmer in question, used it to launch a political career. It&#x27;s also a highly selective retelling of the story that completely omits the __<i>only</i>__ part of the story that the courts objected to: upon learning that certain plants on his property contained the Monsanto roundup resistance gene, Schmeiser purposefully cultivated large quantities of these plants <i>and deliberately took advantage of Monsanto&#x27;s specific addition for commercial gain</i>.<p>The courts were very clear: cultivating the Monsanto Canola without a license was OK, but deliberately taking advantage of roundup resistance without a license was not. How do we know it was deliberate? Because non-Monsanto canola dies when you spray roundup on it. If Percy Schmeiser wasn&#x27;t aware that he was &quot;pirating&quot; Monsanto crops, spraying his field with roundup would have killed his crop.<p>Analogy: My neighbor downloaded Adobe Illustrator over unsecured wifi and I captured their serial number with a sniffer. Now Adobe is suing me because I used that serial number to register 100 new copies of Illustrator at the graphic design business I own. I claim (and the media reports) that I&#x27;m being sued because a serial-number laden wifi signal intruded on my property. After all, it could happen to you too!<p>Case #2: Terminator genes. The way the media / environmental groups reported it: &quot;Monsanto has patented genes which will prevent farmers from re-planting seeds if they can&#x27;t pay Monsanto&#x27;s fees! Monsanto&#x27;s greed will cause poor people to starve!&quot; The way Monsanto reported it: &quot;Monsanto commits to never using terminator genes; we patented them so that we are never forced to use them in order to compete against someone who does.&quot; Monsanto has kept to their word. Come on, guys -- it seems a bit thankless to reward Monsanto for good behavior by lying and making it look like bad behavior.<p>Case #3: Seralini&#x27;s &quot;GMOs cause cancer in rats&quot; study. When we discussed it (the school project was a team project), we agreed that it had some seriously shoddy methodology (if you&#x27;re teaching about PCA abuse, this paper is a good example). It was retracted shortly thereafter, naturally to cries of &quot;conspiracy!&quot; from environmental groups (and sighs of relief from us). Incidentally, a study reaching the opposite conclusion was recently released using a somewhat larger sample size (N=90,000,000,000 vs N=20).<p>EDIT: clarified the Percy Schmeiser narrative to make it clearer that he knew exactly what he was doing (as was established in court).",1421000328

While humans often allow tribalist feelings to influence their choices, there is a difference between those who can choose more and those who can choose less, and the discussion is about those who can can choose more restricting the mobility of those who can choose less. Those are facts -- they are not a matter of opinion or ideology, but the objective reality. It is you who decided that &quot;tribalist feelings&quot; are the cause of segregation, which is a nice hypothesis but a factually wrong one. What you have here isn&#x27;t tribe A and tribe B, but a dominant tribe A and a weak tribe B, and power dynamics has a far stronger effect than in-group dynamics, as proven by history in this particular case and others like it.

This fear is only exacerbated by the fact that no detailed demographic projections for radical life extension scenario have been conducted so far. This study explores different demographic scenarios and population projections, in order to clarify what could be the demographic consequences of a successful biomedical war on aging. A general conclusion of this study is that population changes are surprisingly slow in their response to a dramatic life extension. For example, we applied the cohort-component method of population projections to 2005 Swedish population for several scenarios of life extension and a fertility schedule observed in 2005. Even for very long 100-year projection horizon, with the most radical life extension scenario (assuming no aging at all after age 60), the total population increases by 22% only (from 9.1 to 11.0 million). Moreover, if some members of society reject to use new anti-aging technologies for some religious or any other reasons (inconvenience, non-compliance, fear of side effects, costs, etc.), then the total population size may even decrease over time. Thus, even in the case of the most radical life extension scenario, population growth could be relatively slow and may not necessarily lead to overpopulation. Therefore, the real concerns should be placed not on the threat of catastrophic population consequences (overpopulation), but rather on such potential obstacles to a success of biomedical war on aging, as scientific, organizational, and financial limitations.&quot;",1420999762

The Ellison Medical Foundation fell into this category, as aging was only an incidental part of the Foundation&#x27;s plan. The point was molecular biology, and aging just happened to be one of the better fields to exercise that goal. So the EMF simply expanded some of the NIA study programs and arguably did nothing meaningful to advance progress towards therapies for aging.<p>Then 95%+ of the sliver of funding and interest that does aim to extend life goes towards things that have absolutely no hope of meaningful results. They are generally focused on trying to understand metabolism sufficiently well to slow aging slightly. An over the top ambitious goal in this area is adding seven years to life spans over the next 20 years - that&#x27;s the Longevity Dividend proposal. There is no concrete plan, nowhere near the level of understanding needed to even have a plan, and so people pick at proteins and mechanisms one by one that might be linked to calorie restriction or autophagy or other longevity-associated mechanisms. Look at the past fifteen years of very expensive and entirely fruitless sirtuin research to see how this will go over the next decade. The research community is gearing up to spend billions more on mTOR-related work, and the expectation of outcomes should be exactly the same: knowledge, but not therapies.<p>Genetics is another area of favor at the moment, but is just another facet of &quot;let&#x27;s mess with metabolism&quot; to try to find ways to slow down the accumulation of damage in this vastly complex poorly understood system. There is an argument to say that all of this focus on things that won&#x27;t really help much is in fact just a new way for researchers to draw in new funding to the established goal of mapping metabolism.<p>Since aging is damage, slowing damage is pretty useless for old people. They won&#x27;t benefit from that approach at all. If we&#x27;re going to wait around for the next few decades for treatments, I want to see rejuvenation at the end of the line instead of merely tinkering the system to damage itself more slowly. Rejuvenation means repair: if aging is damage, then rejuvenation is repairing that damage.<p>So the vast unknowns in aging are not related to the actual damage itself, but rather how the damage interacts and progresses in the highly complex apparatus of our biology. There is a very good catalog of the biochemical damage that causes aging, the direct results of the correct operation of metabolism, not caused by other forms of damage. This is the list of distinctive differences between old tissue and young tissue. That catalog was built over the past century and hasn&#x27;t been expanded since the late 1980s, so it is reasonable to think that all the important stuff for now is captured.<p>We could bypass the vast complexity of the &quot;mess with metabolism&quot; approach to slowing aging and instead try to repair the damage. This is much better as there are concrete plans for doing so, and so much is known of the damage that there are numerous very detailed proposals for producing repair therapies. If you can repair the damage then you don&#x27;t need to know how it progresses in detail from moment to moment, or which form is more important, or how exactly it causes age-related disease. Just fix it. The analogous situation is rust in an ornate, complex, load-bearing metal structure: rust is simple, the structure is complicated, so the results of rust over time will be very complicated. Do you build models and analyse the molecular progression of rust in ever more detail to figure out how to build better structures, or do you just paint the thing and rustproof it every now and again? One of those paths is clearly better than the other.<p>This is why I don&#x27;t expect great things from Calico, as Calico is funding the same mainstream approach to aging (mess with metabolism, drug discovery, try to slow aging) that will do a lot for knowledge and next to nothing for practical outcomes to extend life and rejuvenate the old. They won&#x27;t fund the right path, which is to say SENS and related repair-based approaches, until those approaches have completed their disruption of the aging research field and gathered sufficient support that no-one has to specify repair-based approaches as being their approach, because it is just assumed that that is what is meant by aging research.",1420999703

Young people have not had a great record of voting.  So those changes you are attributing to neural plasticity are likely brought about by those old frozen minds you mention, and less so the young plyable ones if you ask me.  But everyone has a right to an opinion I suppose.",1420999561
8870620,comment,8850763,8870473,0,0,timtas,,,"Thanks for the reply and original post. To be clear, my real objection is not with your post but with our (my) expectation that it&#x27;s possible to gain decisive wisdom from post-hoc success stories. I knew better than to fall into this expectation and be disappointed, but I did anyway! It doesn&#x27;t mean that accounts like yours aren&#x27;t interesting and worthwhile.<p>I guess I knew that focussing on Quickbooks and lacking a timer would narrow my market from the start. But we&#x27;re often told, narrow your focus, don&#x27;t try to be all-things-to-all-people, do fewer things well, etc. Probably I needed to actively market from the start.<p>My guess is that time-to-market explains your initial lift, then a strong quality version 1.0 created a tail wind with good reviews, then you jumped on it and did all the right things.

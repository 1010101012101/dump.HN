If you think about it for a moment, that's also exactly what's wrong with CS education in the country.<p>I've been trying to hire a good engineer for the last four months to expand our dev team. We're not a startup  we're part of one of the largest ad/PR networks in the world. We're great paymasters and offer the opportunity to work on some really cool products. And we're based in New Delhi, India.<p>I've met at least 10 people in the last eight weeks  all of them engineers, and none of them seem to know what we're talking about the moment we say things like NLP or Node. In fact, they're not even curious. Just scared, and uninterested in being pushed out of their comfort zone. For eg, one guy told me he ONLY does PHP using the Cake framework. I asked if he had played around with any other framework, he said no. The only reason he was stuck with Cake was because the place he worked at said Cake, he learnt Cake and he used Cake ever since. I asked about MVC and I got a blank look.<p>I just wish I could come across another computer engineer (outside the existing team) who's curious about programming, who still thinks it's magical when the code you write translates in to cool stuff happening on your screen and in boxes all over the world. Who realizes that you're not writing software, you creating an experience for a user and every bit matters.<p>Either they're terribly hard to find, or I don't know where to look :)",1307451485

It was at the expense of a very small amount of execution time, measured in fractions of a machine cycle, but I actually found a way to shorten his code by 1 word and it had only taken me 20 years to do it.<p>Seibel: So 20 years later you said, Hey Bill, guess what?<p>Steele: It wasnt that I spent 20 years doing it, but suddenly after 20 years I came back and looked at it again and suddenly had an insight I hadnt had before: I realized that by changing one of the op codes, it would also be a floating point constant close enough to what I wanted, so I could use the instruction both as an instruction and as a floating point constant.<p>Seibel: Thats straight out of The Story of Mel, a Real Programmer.<p>Steele: Yeah, exactly. It was one of those things. And, no, I wouldnt want to do it in real life, but it was the only time Id managed to reduce some of Gospers code. It felt like a real victory. And it was a beautiful piece of code. It was a recursive subroutine for computing sines and cosines.<p>So thats the kind of thing we worried about back then.",1307451051

Normally, the OTP algorithm takes two args... a ""shared secret"" (each customer has a different secret) and the exact date/time. All the fobs and the back-end server know/share the secret.<p>On the fob thingy, one calculation occurs. The fob can be physical or virtual. So you may have a physical key fob or a virtual software fob for your blackberry, iPhone, Droid, etc. They even work with dumb phones over SMS. Either way, the same calculation occurs. Again, it looks something like this:<p>const unsigned int OTP ( const string& shared_secret, const time& time_of_day )
{
        return OTP;
}<p>So when you push the button on the fob (or just look at it if it's the always on type), it returns an OTP. On the server, the exact same calculation occurs except that it calculates a range of OTPs (in case the time on the fob has drifted... and this does indeed occur). A minute or so worth of calculations. The fob's OTP must fall into the server's calculated range, if not, the OTP will fail and the fob will need to be recalibrated (resync its clock).<p>So, if this story is true, then the list of customer shared secrets was stolen and whoever has them now knows that company X uses secret Y on their fobs.

Obese longs and pointers, imagine the horror - but, no, that's not the reason.<p>The reason for why apps don't get compiled to 64-bits has more to do with the effort required to port said apps to 64-bits.<p>Truth is running 64-bits apps yields other advantages than access to more than 4GB of memory - a 64-bits app has access to the processor's 64-bits instruction set and some architectures allow access to more general purpose registers, memory-mapped files are easier to implement (MongoDB, last time I tried it, was unusable on 32-bits) and performance of applications such as encoders/decoders/encryption software is increased.<p>A 64-bits Flash would clearly benefit from the transition, even if you don't have more RAM.",1307448295

The ability to think logically (one example of which is writing proofs though I think writing good code requires it as much) is no protection against attacks you don't know exist. If we knew exactly how security systems could be broken then building an unbreakable protocol would just require thinking about how to satisfy a bunch of constraints (which mathematicians and computer scientists are trained to do). But, in addition to being resistant to known attacks, a new security protocol should be stress tested by trying to think of new attacks that could break it. Most university courses on security don't emphasize this way of thinking. That's all Scheiner is saying. This guy doesn't mention anywhere how a math degree trains you to do that.",1307448109

We spent weeks showing proofs of very simple security circumstances ""atomic changes to an access control list are provable secure"" and then summed it up with ""anything more complex than this, like nonatomic changes to an ACL are provably insecure"".<p>And that was that.

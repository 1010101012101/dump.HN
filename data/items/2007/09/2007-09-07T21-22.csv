In the product they sold, they made no guarantee that the price wasn't going to drop--lack of a future price drop <i>wasn't</i> part of the product.  If anything, the main 'intangible' in this product was 'smugness'.<p>So, they set the price, and people bought it.  End of story.  They didn't force anyone to.  If someone thought it was worth $600 when, as Cringely says, the 'real' price was the current price, then <i>you</i> made the mistake.",1189202365

MySpace and Facebook are both ""social networking"" in my book, Facebook even moreso, because I only friend people I actually know (However this could be just because I use it in the college context, not the business context).<p>I'd be interesting if there are different usage patterns based on the main use of the network. I see it as keeping in touch with my friends rather than ""networking"" in the business sense. ",1189201900

51924,comment,51451,51862,0,0,thomasptacek,,,"He's not using ""inline"" for the C version, so it counts spurious function call overhead. He's also not holding constant the storage classes between C and C++; his C++ version arbitrarily gets to use optimal storage. This should be intuitive: bare C++ isn't faster than hand-coded C, and beyond that all you can compare is the quality of different libraries.<p>When I say ""merely encourages"", I'm trying to articulate the fact that most large C projects are composed of modules that implement different ADTs. Just because C doesn't call them ""classes"" doesn't mean that most C code isn't reusable.

The way the tech press is pissing and moaning, you'd think Steve Jobs had just robbed money from UNICEF.<p>Of my friends who own iPhones, I haven't heard any of them complaining.

Managing people is a lot more work then programming.  With programming it is you and the computer.  You tell the computer what to do and most of the time the computer complies.  <p>With people, when you tell them what to do they are way less cooperative then a computer and if you think people are just going to be ""on the same page"" as you are and just come up with stuff that matches what you wanted.. well I have tried that and it doesn't work.",1189198909

If you happen to be pushing the top 1 or 2 percent, you either have to lower yourself to the level of your graders or write your best thoughts and expect to receive less than the best grades for them.  <p>If you follow the first track, you can expect the usual laurels for 'achievement.'   If you follow the second, you can expect to increase your intelligence at a higher rate, which may (or may not) have some payback later on.<p>",1189198809

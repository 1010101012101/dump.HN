Does our government police prevent crime, or just punish criminals? I can argue that without any state-established law criminals would be punished, in some way or another.<p>Medical services?

When you need to write a load balancer and want to test different languages for the task, you don&#x27;t do a benchmark like that one.<p>Writing a &quot;ping-pong&quot;? And not using the same client to test both servers?<p>It would not have been too hard to write a simple proxy in both languages. Not even worrying about parsing HTTP headers, just testing TCP, that is really easy.<p>Now, if you really want to test the performance, you have to implement it differently. Just two small features you would need in both:<p>* non blocking IO: right now, you&#x27;re starting a new future in Scala, that&#x27;s easy to write but not really efficient (it might work better with goroutines)\n* zero copy: if you&#x27;re load balancing, you will spend your time moving bits, so you&#x27;d better make sure that you don&#x27;t copy them too much. It is possible with Scala, but it looks like Go does not support it<p>Now, when you have reasonable testing grounds (that woudn&#x27;t be more that a hundred lines in both languages), better get your statistics right.<p>&quot;The client would make 100 concurrent connections and send a total of 1 million pings to the server, evenly distributed over the connections. We measured the average round trip time&quot; -> that is NOT how you should test. Here, you would want to know what is the nominal pressure the balancer could handle, so you must measure a lot of metrics:<p>* RTT\n* bandwidth (per user and total)\n* time to warmup (the JVM optimizes a lot of things on the fly, you have to wait for it)\n* operational limits (what is the maximal bandwidth for which the performance crashes? same for number of users)<p>And then, you don&#x27;t measure only the average values. You must measure the standard deviation. Because you could have a good average, but wildly varying data, and that is not good.<p>Last thing: the macbook may not be a good testing system.",1375782047

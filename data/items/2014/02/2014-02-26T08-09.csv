And an investor has the same experience -- he can&#x27;t possibly get more than the market value of his shares on the day of sale.<p>Brokerage houses are in competition to offer the lowest transaction costs and the most reliable environment for trading.

7303701,comment,7301481,7302015,7,0,mzl,,,"N-queens, while quite a cute problem, is typically not that interesting as a constraint programming benchmark. The way to make it fast is to have a bit-set representation of the domains, which is not the best representation for many other important cases.<p>I tested the standard Gecode (<a href=""http://www.gecode.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gecode.org</a>) implementation from version 4.2.1 without any special options on a MacBook Pro with a 2.6GHz Intel Core i7. Note that Gecode does not have bit-set representations for domains, so it is not optimized for this special case. Tests were run for 500 iterations and repeated 5 times to get deviations below 2.5%. I get the following timings for your sizes plus 50 and 100:<p><pre><code>    n   time\n    8     0.0368 ms\n   10     0.0243 ms\n   15     0.0221 ms\n   20     0.1263 ms \n   25     0.2677 ms\n   30     0.1621 ms \n   35     0.2433 ms \n   50     2.3234 ms \n  100     0.5509 ms\n</code></pre>\nThe timings are of course all strongly dependent on the heuristic used for finding the solution which is shown by the varying times above.<p>Constraint programming is typically also very dependent on the  the pruning power of the constraints. Adding the option &quot;-icl dom&quot; which makes the pruning for the all-different constraints domain consistent, gives the following timings.<p><pre><code>    n   time\n    8     0.1138 ms\n   10     0.0603 ms\n   15     0.0879 ms\n   20     0.2801 ms \n   25     0.6612 ms\n   30     0.4657 ms \n   35     0.7553 ms  \n   50     2.7687 ms \n  100     8.7687 ms\n</code></pre>\nAs can be seen, domain consistency did not actually help us in this case time-wise. The number of search-nodes visited range between 17 and 1066 for the normal consistency level, while the number of nodes visited for the domain consistent version range between 14 and 286. The reduction in search tree size was however offset by the increased complexity of the propagator.",1393403438

Let&#x27;s say that a 10% return is the mean return, and one standard deviation is 5% -- just an example, and these numbers aren&#x27;t real (although they could be established by asking everyone what their returns are).<p>So a return of 20% or better represents two standard deviations above the norm, or 2.2% of the investing population (this is a one-tailed distribution). How many investors will achieve that result in a large population? 2.2%. In a pool of a million investors, that&#x27;s 22,000 people.<p>> Buffett is an existence proof that investment is skill, not chance.<p>With all respect, it&#x27;s more accurate to say that your view of probability is an existence proof that many people don&#x27;t understand statistics. Let me ask you -- do you understand how science works? Scientists don&#x27;t say what you just said, ever. They say that the probability that this outcome resulted from chance is p (&quot;p-value&quot;), referring to the probability that the result arose because of chance. (My 2.2% probability above is a p-value.)<p>When the LHC scientists announced that they believed they might have detected the Higgs boson, did they say that their measurement constituted an &quot;existence proof&quot; that the Higgs was real? No, because they were scientists addressing educated people, they expressed their result in terms of a p-value -- p was the probability that their result came about because of chance, not the hypothesized particle.<p>A chance result isn&#x27;t the last possibility that a scientist considers, it&#x27;s the first. And no one who has been educated claims that a result that might have arisen by chance constitutes an &quot;existence proof&quot;.",1393403143

We&#x27;re told it&#x27;s important because there&#x27;s a tax credit for R&D. My (probably faulty) memory says that our guidelines classify all development on new features and products, as well as any research necessary in executing my job, as R&D.

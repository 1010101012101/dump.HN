The same individual has encountered persistent questioning over the specifics of his birthplace, despite ample documentation substantiating his claims.<p>How information is interpreted depends very much on who's interpreting it and what their objectives are.<p>Hiring processes are notoriously opaque. Corporations are, very literally, machines for creating one-way flows of liability, shielding management and owners at the expense of the public and workers.

We have at least 2 centuries of rapid innovation to draw on when we note that unemployment has not skyrocketed with technological progress.

Yet, unemployment is still exceedingly low by world and historical standards.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.acus.org/files/u3/USA-GDP-1810-2010.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acus.org/files/u3/USA-GDP-1810-2010.png</a><p>The market works to provide jobs to those who demand jobs.

What you're missing is that the reason that people were still employed at relatively similar levels and GDP per capitas was because consumer demand rose to meet lower prices. These are all matters of supply and demand.<p>> the currently in-progress one, of moving from industrial employment to service-sector and/or information-sector employment<p>This shift is already very much completed. Over 80% of the USA's economy is service-sector at this point, and we haven't observed any unemployment issues that can be attributed to technology growth.<p>What we can predict about the future is what our modern understanding of economics and historical perspectives tell us.

Large-scale shifts just haven't happened often in history, so it's hard to generalize from the data points we do have.<p>For most of human history, most human labor was engaged in agriculture. During the industrial revolution, there was a mass shift from agriculture to factory work. This produced considerable social disruption, but did result in a new semi-stable employment system: over a period of some decades, the countrysides were largely depopulated, people congregated in the cities, and the factories were an employment sink for the newly arrived urbanites. Took until probably the mid 20th century to sort out in any kind of reasonable way (the tenement slums of Manhattan were probably initially a net decrease in quality of life for many former farmers, but they were eventually cleaned up).<p>I'd say that's actually the only real example of a completed shift in mass employment at that scale. The key thing that made it work particularly well was that assembly lines needed a large amount of labor, with a nicely arrayed gradation of skill: they could absorb a large amount of essentially undifferentiated unskilled labor fresh from the countryside, which could then ""work its way up"" by gaining more skills to serve in increasingly more skilled roles.<p>The other example of a shift we have is the currently in-progress one, of moving from industrial employment to service-sector and/or information-sector employment. It's less clear where that's going, what the new mass employment sinks will be (if any), and what the skill ladder will be.",1348435383

It's too late to save shazow time and stress, but I wrote a notify-wait for OS X: <a href=""https://github.com/ggreer/fsevents-tools"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ggreer/fsevents-tools</a>. It's not as fully-featured as inotify-tools (since FSEvents isn't as granular), but it's pretty handy.",1348434416

Right now inflation is hovering around 1%, but yet my fiance is saddled with 150k of medical school loans at 7%. At least if student loans could be refinanced easily or had some regulations to pin their interest rates at or below inflation in certain conditions, students could tread water for a few years until their job prospects improved. Or, especially if rates could be lowered below inflation over time, the loan could naturally decrease in value as the likelihood of repayment goes down.<p>All-in-all the psychological pressures on the young that build after college due to compounding interest on loans seems to be just as scary for the future of our country than the absolute amount of the debt itself.",1348434399

This of course is a sad situation, but am I wrong to ask if it is smart to even <i>have</i> children in his position?<p>Edit2: I'm not suggesting eugenics or restricting the freedom to reproduce in any way but an education campaign.",1348434380

They are mostly started by kids fresh out of college and have no real world experience at all.<p>What they DO have is a lot of energy and creativity.  The talented developers usually come in to those companies a little down the road when things start to take off, or are there in the rare case of a veteran founding team.<p>Security and clean code are not sexy parts of the job, so a lot of startups make them secondary concerns.  Young programmers don't understand technical debt because they simply haven't dealt with it, so things start off with a poor structure and need to be refactored down the road.",1348434230

Phone lines are easily tappable because the phone system is fundamentally insecure. The police generally obtained cooperation from phone companies for taps simply because it's <i>easier</i>. Phones that could do secure end-to-end communication basically didn't exist.<p>Compare with the modern internet, where secure end-to-end communication is easy to accomplish and requires no cooperation from the parties involved in transmitting the message. This is totally different from before, when the police could just go have a friendly chat with the phone company. Now they need to get access to at least one <i>end</i> of the communication in order to eavesdrop reliably.

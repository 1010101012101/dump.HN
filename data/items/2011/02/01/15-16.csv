Software engineers do lots of things, but theoretically the main reason I was there was to develop software (mostly Big Freaking Enterprise Java web applications, for universities, and software which supported the development of the same).<p>I would be happy to talk to you about that experience at length.  The capsule summary is that I cannot recommend working for a Japanese megacorp as a means of broadening one's horizons unless one has the very specific desire to learn about Japanese megacorps.

Outside of this sting they have always been at pains to put forward the view that nothing is manually ranked.<p>I think the same thing applies to Bing here: if they have a generic algorithm that ranks results based on toolbar (or other data) it could be easy to see how their data is skewed by Google given the amount of traffic Google search gets compared to the rest of the internets. This seems fine to me.<p>But if their algorithm does stuff with activity on google.com <i>because it is google.com</i> then this is a pretty clear foul - it is both essentially copying, and the equivalent of manually ranking results (specifically, Google results)<p>The corollary of this is that if their algorithm is generic, then it will still work if Google were to cease to exist.

We granted telecoms monopoly power back before deregulation became popular, and those monopolies have carried over to the internet. But since the general trend over the past 20-30 years has been to remove existing regulations and not add new ones, there are few laws on the books to protect consumers in the realm of new technology.

Let me clarify on this:\nYes, in CS you might not learn how to program well, this is true. However, when you study you get knowledge about several interesting computer science problems and how to solve them. You will see that problems later in your programming carrier however now you have a good background to solve them. Just a simple example:\nYou given an array (let's say integeres). How would you remove all duplicates? A naive solution would be to check for every value, if there is more of this in the array. This has a running time complexity of O(n^2). The better way would be first to sort your array and then just iterate and remove all neighbours which are equal. This corresponds to O(nlogn) + O(n) complexity.<p>What I try to say, as a young ""coder"" you might not see all the troubles (in this case performance) you make when coding just straight away. You need to understand what you are actually doing, for this CS study gives you a good background.<p>The other really important point is: Startups fail with very high probability! CS diploma (or whatever this is in your country) gives you a solid background on which you can relay, when looking for a job position after your startup time. \nSo, complete with your study is maybe a very classic way, however this is the most secure way for a long term.",1296573874

I’ve been frustrated with some aspects of my college experience and spent much of my first semester thinking and writing about what could be done to address my concerns.<p>Over winter break, some unschooled friends at I were conversing about our frustrations with higher education.  We found that we had precisely the same frustrations about college, even though we attend different institutions (Dartmouth, Pacific Luther).  We threw around some ideas via email, with my friend suggesting “we should just start our own college a la the movie ‘Accepted.’”<p>I loved the idea, but thought it to be a long-term goal rather than an actionable plan.  After pondering the concept for a bit, I came to the conclusion that our frustrations with higher education stem not from the specific institutions we attend but rather from what we had in common: unschooling.<p>Unschooling provided an excellent (and in some ways) superior education.  As unschoolers, we were free to learn whenever and wherever we pleased — which meant constantly.  We took our knowledge from theory to practice, starting organizations and creating internships.  We learned for learning’s sake — not to pass a test.  We found innovative ways to apply what we learned.  We were forced to think independently and analytically.  We learned how to interact with our peers and function in a classroom setting by auditing college courses.  By serving as both teacher (planning our courses) and student (doing the coursework) we created the ultimate leadership experience.<p>Last week, I decided that the 'homeschooler college' was not unthinkable and registered http://uncollege.org.  I launched the site last week and have been soliciting feedback since.<p>UnCollege is a self-directed learning experience for driven individuals to complement traditional higher education, offering a community of like-minded peers and mentors to support your self-directed journey of learning and introspection.<p>I would love to hear your thoughts, comments, criticisms, and suggestions.

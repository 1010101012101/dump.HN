I finally gave up, because things were &quot;better&quot; but still far worse than windows. It&#x27;s only gotten worse since then. One of the biggest examples I can see right now is the support compiler chains give in terms of the development process. Visual Studio makes simple what open tools like emacs make near impossible. Remote debugging on windows is a matter of downloading and running the remote debug server, and connecting to it with the local copy of windows. Visual Studio will install any requisite dependencies, transfer app over, and run it all with just pushing debug remotely. For the things I&#x27;m working on, where I need access to various hardware devices, such availability is a godsend, and as far as I can tell, any Linux based development environments make such difficult if not impossible to replicate. Other things I notice are Free Software checkers for things like MISRA-C compliance, which puts C programs through much more rigorous checks for safe usage and avoiding poor design decisions. Being open source shouldn&#x27;t be an excuse for the software to have a fraction of the features other environments have.",1452203845

Whenever I go to bed it just takes 1-2 hours to fall asleep.  I just can&#x27;t get my mind to shut off.  I struggle to get up at 9:30am and need coffee to be functional in the mornings.<p>If I go out on a long camping trip I&#x27;ll often not even bring a book.  This means that once the sun goes down there is basically nothing to do.  After a day or two I find myself easily falling asleep and sleeping through the night.  When I come back home, if I still haven&#x27;t begun to go back to work, it persists.  I can easily just go to bed at 11:00 and get up at 8:00.  It generally lasts until I go to work.<p>It&#x27;s the anxiety of needing to get things done and maintain my appearance to others and to myself that really seems to keep me up.

I&#x27;m working hard on meditation, mindfulness and self-awareness to reduce the anxiety, but what works best is to really remove myself from the stressors and go to a place where I really just can&#x27;t <i>do</i> anything so my mind gives up.<p>I went camping near the end of December and had another week off for the new year.

Not impressive for Hacker News overall, but, hey, decent for my own personal blog&#x27;s track record.<p>The top voted comment on it is incredibly dismissive, completely dismissing my 6-ish years of college, more than 5 years working in insurance, etc. over one detail that wasn&#x27;t thoroughly researched and was, in fact, framed to admit that it was kind of hand-wavy. I don&#x27;t think what I said was entirely wrong and stupid, but it wasn&#x27;t 100% accurate.<p>(HN item in question: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10819091"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10819091</a>)<p>But I think I have two choices here:<p>I can be completely bummed that one person chose to completely dismiss everything based on one not perfect remark in the piece and others upvoted that. Or I can value the upvotes the item got, the amount of meaningful discussion it did generate, the page views it got, and the constructive feedback that tells me that if I want to write more on this topic, I need to do a bit more research and firm up my ability to defend my points or random asshats are going to say &quot;Well, based on one single detail, nothing she says can possibly have any merit.&quot;<p>But, hey, I have done similar things myself: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10828054"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10828054</a> So, maybe people doing that isn&#x27;t all asshattery. Maybe it is more complicated than that and when someone tells you &quot;x detail makes me not read/believe/whatever any of it&quot;, then that is constructive feedback that you can choose to try to learn something from so you can improve your writing -- or not, as you see fit.<p>I have spent a lot of years trying to figure out how to express myself effectively online. I think part of the challenge is that a) your audience is incredibly diverse, so lazy writing habits that are rife with unquestioned assumptions which may be racist, sexist, etc are going to get called out online even though your personal circle of friends wouldn&#x27;t have a problem with it (because they are also kind of racist, sexist, whatever) and b) you are talking to people who may know more than you about some piece of it and/or can google up info, either to fact check or just to rebut because they don&#x27;t like you, don&#x27;t agree with your point, just got dumped, are IUI (Internetting Under The Influence) or for any damn reason.<p>So, in addition to readers perhaps needing to try to &quot;find the insight, not the error,&quot; authors can also try to focus more on the metrics that make them feel positive about having written it rather than focusing on the comments that make them cringe.<p>It took some self control at first, but I am finding that my experience of the Internet is much better now that I focus more on counting the positives and, as much as possible, ignoring the negatives. It does involve some judgment calls. You can&#x27;t just turn the other cheek on everything. There are situations where you need to correct people or clarify your meaning or defend your statement. But if you are getting traffic and getting comments, even if some of them are ugly, then you accomplished something.<p>I am trying harder to decide what I want to accomplish, keeping my eye on evidence that I am moving that goal forward, and not expecting some &quot;perfect&quot; experience (for lack of a better way of saying that, as I have other things to do and this comment has gone on long enough).",1452203278

Something I have 0 control over (but had warned them was possible) and eventually I got them to see that, but after considerable stress and pain.<p>That I have seen, Paypal has promised for about 2 years that they are correcting this issue and making things better, yet I still hear about frozen funds quite regularly, even charities which then can cause a charity to potentially be in deep trouble with donors and the law. Almost always Paypal freezes large percentages like 2/3rd&#x27;s of the highest months gross billings, and then hold the remaining during the charge back window.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree Paypal has to be fraud smart, but so does every other payment processor and I don&#x27;t know of another Processor that is as aggressive as Paypal or as willing to interrupt your business as Paypal is.<p>I always wonder if there is some legal factor that could put Paypal in hot water as they are interfering with the operation of your business, potentially tortiously interfering with contracts by witholding funds like this.  My bet is there is something, but they will claim it is in the T&C&#x27;s.

Before starting work on Penny, we asked a hundred or so people &quot;how do you manage your money?&quot; The prevailing answer was, &quot;I don&#x27;t.&quot; So when you give them the tools to do that, it really helps them understand their situation.<p>What we see as the real problem is comprehension and usability. Many people we talked to shy away from apps like Mint because they&#x27;re complex and intimidating. From a more technical/analytical/affluent standpoint (where I come from), I don&#x27;t have an issue using Mint and querying my own data, but it&#x27;s important to remember that I&#x27;m different from most people. So, we think that giving people that awareness of their financial situation in a friendly, relatable, and understandable manner goes a long, long way.<p>Regarding continued use: everybody&#x27;s finances are a representation of their life, and as life changes, your finances do too. So we think there&#x27;s a lot Penny can do to help you on an ongoing basis, like tell you about how your new commute to your new work is affecting your gas spending and your savings rates; mention how Comcast just bumped your bill up by 10%; point out that your Starbucks spending has been trending up and might start being a significant money drain, etc. We might be wrong, but we think we and everybody else in this space have only scratched the surface of what insights can help people with their finances.",1452202437

Some counting queries kept defaulting to full table scans. It turned out that this was because of limited statistics on the distribution of counts by event type.<p>The default_statistics_target config parameter sets how many entries Postgres keeps in the histogram of possible values per column, the default is 100 I think. Because my event types were not evenly distributed, the less frequent ones were missing from the statistics histogram altogether, and somehow this resulted in bad query plans.<p>As a fix, I upped the default_statistics_target to 1000, and to set it to 5000 for the biggest tables. Then after a vacuum analyze, the query planner started making sensible choices.<p>Another thing to try is perhaps reducing the random_page_cost config parameter from it&#x27;s default of 4.0. On SSDs, random page costs are much closer to 1 than they are 4 (compared to long sequential reads).",1452202012

In fact, she was told by her instructors that many journals consider it an ethics violation to use a control group, the logic being that in denying your experimental method to the control group you&#x27;re putting them at a disadvantage.<p>2) Overgeneralizing results. It&#x27;s common to use education students (i.e, future teachers) as experimental subjects in education research. Then the results are interpreted as applying to all students, ignoring all the ways that your typical education students are different from your typical high school or elementary school student.<p>While there were some examples of good education research, she said that by far the best education research she could found was actually published in psychology journals.

To help participants \nimagine these trade-offs concretely and to encourag\ne honest responding (Fisher, 1993), \nwe asked participants to read a short paragraph des\ncribing two individuals who prioritize \nmoney or who prioritize time in their daily lives. \nThe identities of the characters and the \npronouns used in the vignettes were matched to the \nparticipant’s gender (Tina/Tom and \nMaggie/Michael); for participants who did not repor\nt identifying as either male or female, \nthe names and pronouns used in the vignettes were d\nisplayed as gender neutral \n(Madison/Taylor). The choices were presented as fol\nlows: \nTina\n values her \ntime\n more than her money. She is willing to sacrifice h\ner money \nto have more time. For example, Tina would rather w\nork fewer hours and make \nless money, than work more hours and make more mone\ny. \nMaggie\n values her \nmoney\n more than her time. She is willing to sacrifice he\nr time \nto have more money. For example, Maggie would rathe\nr work more hours and \nmake more money, than work fewer hours and have mor\ne time.  \nWe chose a binary response format for pragmatic and\n theoretical reasons. \nPractically, there is an increased awareness about \nthe importance of conducting research \nwith large representative samples (Open Science Col\nlaboration, 2015). Thus, it is \nnecessary to design short measures that minimize pa\nrticipant burden while maximizing \nreliability (Nagy, 2002). Conceptually, we chose th\nis response format because we were interested in assessing people’s broad preferences \nrelated to prioritizing time over money, \nas opposed to assessing people’s domain-specific pr\neferences.<p>A perhaps laudable measure in order to increase study coherence, but it definitely limits the usefulness of this study in terms of making nuanced life choices.",1452200865

Assuming that your underlying disks don&#x27;t lie, losing <i>only</i> the data that was in-flight to the WAL (or whatever is the equivalent in your DB of choice) is the absolute <i>worst</i> data loss you should see from a real SQL database in that situation. [0]<p>Think about the case where an error causes the DB software to crash... You really can&#x27;t make good data robustness guarantees if an unexpected crash endangers more than just the data that&#x27;s in-flight to the WAL.<p>I personally have had the disks that back a rather large (but relatively low-update-volume) Postgres DB drop out on <i>multiple</i> occasions and never lost any data at all. This shouldn&#x27;t be unexpected behavior. :)<p>> You say &quot;upserting into a mysql table&quot;. Which storage engine? MyISAM? InnoDB?<p>&quot;In addition, an INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE statement against a table having more than one unique or primary key is also marked as unsafe. (Bug #11765650, Bug #58637)&quot; [1]<p>Given that this is an <i>unqualified</i> assertion, straight from the MySQL docs, it seems safe to say that this is a weakness in MySQL&#x27;s UPSERT-alike, rather than any limitation of a particular underlying storage engine. (Here are some bug reports that <i>also</i> make unqualified statements about the behavior at issue: [2][3])<p>> ...I was hoping someone could give me a compelling reason to switch to it or to use it.<p><i>shrug</i> Both MySQL and Postgres are capable databases. Postgresql has better documentation, appears to have substantially better internal architecture, and -from what I remember of my early days with MySQL- has <i>far</i> fewer hidden sharp edges than MySQL.<p>I&#x27;m not here to tell you to change what DB you&#x27;re currently using for your production stuff... I don&#x27;t think anyone is. For my projects, I <i>have</i> had substantially better experiences with Postgres than MySQL.<p>EDIT: It occurred to me in the shower that I didn&#x27;t make &quot;loss of in-flight WAL data&quot; sufficiently clear. Unless you <i>explicitly</i> ask for a mode where writes are acknowledged before the DB believes that they&#x27;re safe on disk, [4] then the only &quot;data loss&quot; in the scenarios I described in the comment would be data that had been transmitted <i>to</i> the server, but not acknowledged as committed to the DB. So, correctly-written client programs would experience this &quot;data loss&quot; <i>only</i> as a transaction that failed to commit, maybe followed by DB unavailability.

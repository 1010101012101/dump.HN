My whole point is that smoke in a petrol engine usually means something as either caught fire etc. Smoke in a Battery compartment may or may not.<p>Is it a safety issue? Probably, but not definitely. Do the general public have a problem with smoke on a plane? Hell yes.<p>Our experience with traditional cars and planes is that where there is smoke there is fire. That may or may not be true with the batteries, I dont know but I do know that Boeing do a LOT of testing, so would be suprised to see a plane go down due to these problems.<p>I believe the cars you were talking about were completely submerged in sea water and then caught fire.

I think Boeing's engineers should get some credit for that?<p>There are a grand total of 49 planes total that have been produced and the plane has been in service for little over a year. The fact that no plane has crashed tells you nothing statistically about the safety record of the design.<p>The fact that aviation has a great safety record is MORE reason to worry about any issue, not less. Modern commercial planes are expected to fly for decades over tens of thousands of flights. Even a small issue that is incredibly unlikely is too dangerous when compared to the great safety record of existing airplanes.",1359521714

The trial is barely mentioned and I think it is a huge selling point, especially when everybody who has used the product seems to immediately fall in love with it, so it is important to get as many people to try it [risk free] as you can.<p>Second, as was already shown in the comments, you may want to consider re-recording the video using a windows computer and display that for those who show up with windows.  It may seem obvious to you that SaaS will run on any major OS, but it may not be so clear to customers.

If we want to solve the ""lawyers need to read and understand computer programs for legal reasons"" problem, it makes more sense to just educate lawyers on programming.

Then again, I think Pandemic Legion and Goons used to work together against BoB, but then seemingly broke ties (and now PL+TEST, as part of HBC, have clashed with Goons). This article clarified things for me somewhat:<p><a href=""http://themittani.com/features/why-didnt-hbc-and-cfc-go-war"" rel=""nofollow"">http://themittani.com/features/why-didnt-hbc-and-cfc-go-war</a><p>As far as I understand the article, the CFC and HBC are the two biggest coalitions in the galaxy, and war between them is a risky bet for either in the current conditions. There's not enough incentive for them to do it just yet, and old ties come into play. (Some commenters mentioned technetium moons as an underlying factor - very profitable sources of income which PL stands to lose in a war.)<p>From my outsider point of view, the political situation in the EVE galaxy has matured: the Allies (CFC) beat the Axis (BoB), some residual fighting has gone on, and everyone's trending either towards a Cold War or a United Nations. The ethos of EVE predisposes alliances to conflict, but there's a lot of territory and months of sleepness nights at stake when supercoalitions decide to go to war. And these supercoalitions used to be (at least in part) allied to each other against older enemies.<p>The pendulum might swing again, but this time it won't end as easily as BoB crushed ASCN in 3 months.",1359518977

I think it is unbecoming of an engineer or scientist, particularly of prominence, to voice such opinions without access to design data from the source.<p>Before I could even begin to dare to voice opinion I would need to study CAD models, electrical and electronic diagrams and test data.  I would also want to have access to representative samples of the packs for inspection.  Even then, unless there was something so obviously wrong with the design that a conclusion was inescapable I'd refrain from rash public comments and redouble evaluation efforts to make sure every angle was evaluated exhaustively.<p>Having designed high-performance, high-current chargers in the past I know a thing or two about battery technology, particularly when it comes to failure modes.  When you are doing that kind of work you purposely test designs to induce and document failures and design around them when possible.  Yes, I have blown-up lots of batteries and chargers.  And, yes, this means that if you've worked with high-energy battery technologies (and electronics in general) you get a good general sense of the good, the bad and the ugly.  I get it.  And I would still want design and test data from the horses-mouth before uttering a word.<p>The problem here is that the engineers at Boeing are not clowns.  Unless you consider people with advanced degrees from the top engineering schools in the world to be clowns.  This is an industry that takes what they do very, very seriously.  A lot of work, simulation and testing goes into all of their projects.  I could not imagine the engineers at Boeing slapping together a battery pack for something like the 787 project without years of work and testing.  I just can't see it.  Yet, they are human beings which means that mistakes and miscalculations do happen.  That's true of any human endeavor.<p>And so, making such comments is also disrespectful.  I understand competitive forces very well.  But there's a time and a place for that.<p>If he is wrong he'll have a lot of explaining to do.  If that is the case I hope he'll devote just as much energy to issuing the necessary apologies and clarifications as he does being critical.<p>EDIT:<p>If you ever get a chance to visit the Boeing factory in Seattle it is a must.  I did many years ago.  As an engineer it was fascinating.  I remember one test they showed us where they clamped down (I think) a 747 wing in this huge structure and used incredibly large hydraulic jacks to bend the wing up and down  repeatedly for failure-mode testing.  I could be wrong, but I think I remember the peak to peak bending at the wing-tip was in the order of ten stories.  I could not imagine designing and building an electro-mechanical structure that could do that and survive with enough functionality to get people safely back to ground level.<p>I think this might be it: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRf395ioJRY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRf395ioJRY</a><p>Here's video on the 787 wing: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA9Kato1CxA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA9Kato1CxA</a><p>Also: <a href=""http://www.wired.com/autopia/2010/03/boeing-787-passes-incredible-wing-flex-test/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/autopia/2010/03/boeing-787-passes-incre...</a><p>So, yes, please, I think it might be wise to remain quiet and let those who actually have real data go through a proper investigative process and get us real answers.

Telecoms in North America are properly crazy when it comes to recovering from failure with minimal visible impact to customers.<p>Usually on the Telecom equipment, the backup / state transfer is done at a process level, not at a VM level as suggested, but it's quite common practice.<p>The best equipment I've seen, does this by spawning many equivalent processes, and distributing them among the available blades in the chassis. If you have process mgr1, you get a backup1 process on another blade. As mgr1 processes you're call state, it checkpoints all critical data to the backup1 process. If the mgr1 process itself crashes, or the entire blade fails, all the processes are simply re-spawned, contact their corresponding backup process, and transfer all the state information back, and simply resume. Most end users won't even notice. Using this method, I've seen equipment recover well over 30,000 subscriber sessions in under 5 seconds, most of which probably wouldn't even notice, and even if you did it wouldn't be enough to drop you're data connection (VPN, video streaming, or whatever you're doing). We also don't lose you're bill for the usage either ;)<p>The challenges with applying this to the game environment, is in telecom each user session is independent, and doesn't really interact with other sessions, so we don't have an issue of a single process becoming overloaded and needing to free up resources to handle it. However, it would be properly easy to do within this model, since failure is expect to occur and be recovered from.<p>As a programmer, you have to be properly diligent in the software design, what get's check pointed, when does it occur. I couldn't even imagine trying to retroactively apply this type of design to ""legacy"" software, that wasn't build from the ground up with this model in mind.",1359518473

If new home owners choose Nest instead of another thermostat they only have to save $150 to make it worth it.

Just having your crops cross-pollinated isn&#x27;t enough to help you, or to get Monsanto on your case. They sue farmers who also try to take advantage of the situation by using the special pesticide, which would kill non-cross pollinated plants.<p>Also, while its hard to pin down libertarianism, there is a lot of conflation between libertarianism and anarchism online. There is nothing un-libertarian about what Monsanto does. Classic libertarians believe in property rights and contractual rights. Monsanto&#x27;s legal actions largely rely on a web of contracts. There is nothing about classic libertarianism that is inconsistent with patents as property rights. Indeed, patents are a basically libertarian response to the neoclassical economic problem of free riding. The libertarian preference for addressing market failures is the creation of property rights. In this context, its more consistent with classical libertarianism for Monsanto to get property rights in its Round Up Ready seeds, and thus make the money that bankrolls their billions of dollars in annual research, than for say the government to spend that money to do basic research.",1389664480

This of course causes problems with having less space onscreen for the content you probably care about, but it is solvable.<p>Perhaps it could be designed to rise into view if you move the mouse cursor to the bottom of the screen, or in mobile application, perhaps it is visible when scrolling but after a predetermined timeout, it lowers out of view.<p>Another possibility would be for it to show when you scroll back in the list, like the address bar does with Chrome on Android. It is a little less discoverable, especially since the direction the footer would move is counter-intuitive to the scrolling movement, but once that behavior is seen the first time, I&#x27;m willing to bet that it is easily recognized and understood how to bring it up again in the future.<p>This isn&#x27;t really a problem with infinite scrolling, but it may be a problem with the  implementation.",1389664336

At one time I thought there would be room for developing and selling big libraries of authentic sounds, and I still make a point of recording as many prop-specific sounds on set as possible. But it&#x27;s a case of diminishing returns - as long as the library and use of stock sounds on a picture is not completely awful/inappropriate, &#x27;good enough&#x27; is the prevailing standard, and you&#x27;re better off layering and recycling sounds in combination with effects or hiring a foley artist.

You have to deal with that by adding insulation or living in a colder house. Where many people can save money is waste: when the heating or cooling would have run without benefit – e.g.  it&#x27;s 40° outside and you&#x27;re paying to keep it over 65° but it&#x27;d really be perfectly fine if it drifted down to 50° for the 8+ hours in the middle of the day when everyone&#x27;s at work. A serious miser will religiously turn it off before they walk out the door but most people won&#x27;t. Many people even leave the thermostat set at a comfortable temperature because they dislike coming home to a very cold/hot house.<p>Those people are the ones who will benefit the most from something programmable but unfortunately most of the devices on the market have horrible UIs and none of the $30 ones will do things like detect when you aren&#x27;t home, which is significant for people who don&#x27;t have rigidly predictable schedules. Again, it doesn&#x27;t have to be a game-theoretical optimum – only better than what most people are doing now.<p>> Unfortunately my heating bills over a very long term only average maybe $100/month, which I&#x27;m sure sounds insane to coasties<p>Head to New England and your new neighbors will complement you on your frugality, as most people have heating bills 4-8 times that high in the winter. Toss in, say, a spike in heating oil costs and anything which reduces inefficiency starts to look pretty cheap. Hint: none of them had McMansions, either – it&#x27;s just cold during the winter in Connecticut.<p>> So I can save about $1/month or $12/year. At $300 retail, it&#x27;ll pay for itself by 2039.\nEven worse, most will be purchased using a 30% interest rate credit card, making payback time infinite. The 30% interest on the credit card to pay for the $300 thermostat would be $90/year but I&#x27;m only saving at best $12/year. Whoops.<p>When you need to make up numbers so the math makes your argument seem less arbitrary it&#x27;s time to accept that other people are allowed to make decisions in life without your approval. You&#x27;re overstating the purchase price by nearly 25% and assuming the worst possible purchase method – and you&#x27;re doing that for an amount which the average American household spends on cable tv / internet / smartphones every couple of months.<p>> The final killer problem is I intentionally don&#x27;t live in a McMansion so I can have a better lifestyle, such as not shivering in the winter. I&#x27;ve already decided to own a 25% smaller house to save 25% on my heating bills, I have absolutely no interest whatsoever in saving 10% on my bill by shivering. I&#x27;m not paying thousands of dollars a month to shiver in a house when I could be warm and toasty in a hundreds of dollars a month apartment. Nope not happening non-starter totally uninterested.

Also, in my opinion, I believe that feeling the need to save every single conversation you have fuels an over-inflated sense of self-worth, and that everything you say has value and needs to be saved.<p>I never, ever peruse through my messages, to reminisce over an old conversation.  It&#x27;s too much navel-gazing to suit my sense of pride.  What actually matters is the actual relationship you have with a person, which is built on the BODY of IMs, messages, conversations, visits, dinners, parties, etc, that you shared with that person.  Sometimes, it&#x27;s best to leave good conversations in the blurry past, and just remember that a certain person is funny, a great conversationalist, etc.<p>I&#x27;m doing the same sort of thing with Google now.  I will disallow anyone I&#x27;m in a conversation with to google facts with their phone.  When we talk, it&#x27;s about whatever resides in our own brains, be it good, bad or ugly.  The entertaining part of any conversation is the actual conversation, the passion, the humor, etc.  If all we wanted to do was pass around facts, then we can forward each other URLs and be done with it.  When I&#x27;m talking with someone over dinner, we&#x27;re not hammering out a contract that requires precision, we&#x27;re having a conversation over ideas, and as funny as it sounds, facts aren&#x27;t as important as the spirit of the conversation.

It&#x27;s annoying if I want to reread something because I missed comprehension, but it makes me faster than needing to figure out where the next line begins while performing a visual carriage return and line feed.<p>Personally, I love infinite scrolling when I&#x27;m consuming content. The problem I face is when it is online content and I&#x27;ve followed a link. This isn&#x27;t a problem for websites I view in a computer, because I usually just open a new tab and when I close it, I&#x27;m right back where I left off. If the site or application stopped after only 20 items, perhaps it was that 21st item I would have really been interested in reading.<p>For the past several years I&#x27;ve mostly switched to devices like my phone and tablets. Applications don&#x27;t often feature the same approach and can&#x27;t as easily return to the view I was looking at. This really limits the usefulness of infinite scrolling. If the application unloaded in the background, when I return to it, the view has reset itself at the top of the list. If I&#x27;m a hundred &quot;pages&quot; into the stream, I need to start over with new content that has arrived since I started reading, scroll for a few minutes until I start to recognize content that was close to where I left off, and then actually find where I went off on a tangent.<p>One solution to fix this problem would be a user enabled filter that hides content that I&#x27;ve scrolled past and only shows &quot;fresh&quot; content. Pagination usually solves this problem for you by having a view that includes where you are in the list. Of course that is invalidated when the whole stream is reset, but if only 10 new items have been added, it wouldn&#x27;t take that long to resume where I left off.<p>Finally, sites that weight the ranking, like Reddit or Hacker News, cause both systems to foul up. Since the content resorts it is practically impossible to determine &quot;where you left off.&quot; Implementing a mechanism to hide headlines for posts I&#x27;ve already scrolled past, would go a long way to resolving this last problem. In a best case scenario, I&#x27;d be more productive. In a worst case scenario, I&#x27;d be no better off than I am today, but it is difficult to think of situations where this design wouldn&#x27;t be  beneficial to the end user.",1389663377

The internal source code of PHP was often a mess of macros everywhere, and the whole PHP6 unicode fiasco really did paint a grim picture of its future.<p>Facebook seems to have given it a bit of fresh air, implementing some pretty interesting stuff (Hindley-Milner with subclasses, for instance), and it really seems like the &quot;feel&quot; of programming in PHP has changed. I&#x27;m not going to say &quot;Screw C++ and Haskell, _this_ is a serious language!&quot;, but on the other hand I feel I can say with a straight face to someone who is starting programming, &quot;You could check this language out&quot;, without a guilty conscience that I&#x27;ll be ruining their mind.<p>I&#x27;m unsure of PHP&#x27;s future - if it&#x27;ll be tied to Facebook (and thus Facebook&#x27;s future, which I am equally unsure of), for example - but as of now, it seems to be a reasonable, if idiosyncratic, language.<p>So yeah, good talk :)",1389662971

The development model is: &quot;modify code, reload page.&quot;  That&#x27;s it.  Simple and effective-- nearly optimal in fact for rapid development of code.<p>2.  Program State:  all PHP programs start as a web request with an empty heap and empty namespace.  Cross-request state must always be saved explicitly and this tends to reduce bugs considerably at the cost of 10ms or so additional processing time for each request.<p>3.  Concurrency model that relies on the request/server architecture rather than a specific language feature.  PHP&#x27;s strict enforcement of one thread per program per request forces you to use this model.  The downside is that it&#x27;s not applicable outside of the web server environment.  Which, he argues, is fine since you want a tool optimized for the job you&#x27;re trying to do.<p>Also:<p>0.  He reviewed a number of PHP weaknesses, accepted that they are legitimate flaws in the language, and that if you had a PHP do-over there&#x27;s no good reason to make all those mistakes again.  But, he&#x27;ll accept these flaws to benefit from the strengths listed above.  He also shared the observation that a wide variety of programmers seem capable of becoming productive in PHP rather quickly, even if they&#x27;ve never used it before.<p>4.

I long for a search engine like Hoogle in other languages (<a href""http://www.haskell.org/hoogle"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/</a>).  Most functions are very obvious from their signature and name.<p>My favorite example are two functions with the signatures:<p><pre><code>    fun1: a -> a\n    fun2: Int -> Int\n</code></pre>\nYou might think the first is more powerful because it takes any type and returns that type, but ultimately, that function can only be the identify function (barring unusual things like exceptions, undefined values and runtime introspection).  With the second function it could do all sorts of things.  It might increment, it might decrement, it might divide by two and round down if the argument is a multiple of three.<p>I&#x27;ll go further to say that it&#x27;s very frustrating in languages like C++ and Java to have to deal with statics and objects.

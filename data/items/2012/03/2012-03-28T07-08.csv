So, if you can argue that _the_people_ will not want to see these things punished, you may see the law changed. However, I do not see that happening soon.

Everyone benefits only when the patent expires. In the meantime the patent holder controls the market and reaps the benefits, hence it becomes a legal, time-limited monopoly. The only possible countermeasure is to have critical patents yourself and play a game of dissuasion, or throw yourself into Mutually Assured Litigation.<p>Indeed in that case the only solution would have been to patent the 'guess which of the 2-10 multi-touch taps is intentional' technique in hopes that you could countersue or trade it, hence locking down the area further and preventing progress even more.

3765160,comment,3764640,3764640,14,0,wannesm,,,"I love Latex but it (or more specifically TeX) is showing its age. It's perfect for writing a paper given a good template but writing and debugging these templates (.cls, .sty) is unnecessarily hard. For my job (in academia), I have to update such Latex templates on a monthly basis and always end up looking at the current improvements for Latex. This updating task involves not 'writing' in Latex but 'programming' in Latex. If you are used to modern programming languages then Tex is stubborn and hard, therefore, I always have the feeling there is improvement possible (I mean, Python, Javascript, C++, ... are all easier to debug). Although people are working hard on this and doing interesting work (i.e., LuaLatex, Latex3), I feel the underlying Tex language has had its time and a more drastic change might be necessary. Remember that Tex is designed for computers with an order of magnitude less resources.<p>An increasingly interesting Latex replacement is, maybe surprisingly, html in combination with css and javascript. With every update of our browser the inspection and debugging tools become more powerful and every time I can track layout and programming bugs a little bit faster. With the addition of more properties targeting paged media in css3 it now becomes possible to also create nicely looking pdfs starting from html. Prince (<a href=""http://www.princexml.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.princexml.com/</a>), for example, is ahead of the browsers for CSS paged media properties and outputs a pdf-file directly. But also typical features for which we praise Latex are becoming available:<p>- Mathematical formulae: <a href=""http://www.mathjax.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathjax.org/</a><p>- Bibliographies: <a href=""http://citationstyles.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citationstyles.org/</a><p>- Advanced hyphenation: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/</a><p>Most people only use the basic commands and don't care about the underlying engine. Therefore, Latex as a 'writing' language is not too attached to the Tex 'programming' language. Pandoc (<a href=""http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/</a>) could be enough to translate such Latex code to another markup format and use another engine.

Value types don't touch GC. Also on the low level Mono has SIMD vector support which is also useful, you can even turn off dynamic bound checking when you need extra performance and presumably already did the testing. Also native interop is better with PInvoke. This might not be relevant for web development (although jgit and twitter teams both mentioned they had problems with this), but I did game development before switching and this sort of thing really matters. .NET was bad on the JIT/inlining/optimization side but Mono fixes that with AOT compilation/using LLVM for code generation.<p>And .NET has better libraries to deal with asynchronous programming, Task uses continuation passing and each thread has it's own ""event loop"" with SynchronizationContext, it's really simple to switch between them, Java has all sort of mixes, some API's use pooling, some use continuations, and you have to mess around with Executors since there is no equivalent to SynchronizationContext. Also RX is a wonderful abstraction on event streams. Java can't even consider this sort of API's because it has no lambdas/extension methods, and this reflects in JVM libraries.",1332919697

This is something it actually is doing: 360, Windows Phone and Windows 8 all look awesome. I would be very happy for Balmer to leave and for him to be replaced by J Allard (Entertainment and Devices head that left/was forced out). From the outside looking in, it looked like Allard had vision, he knew how to execute, and he knew the culture the company needed to cultivate to achieve it. Xbox and Windows Phone was out of E&D, as well as the canned-but-great-looking Courier.<p>2. Have better ad campaigns. Across all divisions, the ad campaigns have been uniformly awful.<p>3. Keep executing cleanly. No company is past redemption, but Microsoft's history is not good. They need to keep being good citizens.

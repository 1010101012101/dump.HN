Why should the interests of one child (or adult) necessarily conflict with that of any other, or group of them? Is the goal that everyone should flourish the most from wherever they start, or is it that they should end up with the most identical result possible, regardless of the individuals?<p>Edit: remember that a statistical approach is only valid in a certain context. For example, you only need evidence that a judge has taken bribes from the Mafia once to know that he's corrupt. There are other contexts where statistics are vital (in the special sciences, for example - I think of quantum probability, or statistical thermodynamics), but I don't believe that statistics properly enter into the fundamental science of philosophy and its branches (Plato, so far as I am aware, did not rely on statistical concepts to discover that there's such a thing as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and then politics). If statistics were a fundamental science (intellectually speaking), on what basis could we justify its correct uses vs. incorrect ones?",1315504729

2974915,comment,2973906,2974497,5,0,lucasjung,,,"><i>The teacher-student-parent relationship isn't adversarial.</i><p>Sometimes it <i>is</i>, and in those cases parents need to advocate for their children.  The unfortunate truth is that there are asshats in every segment of the population, including teachers and school administrators.  Parents need to be prepared to defend their children in case they end up with an asshat for a teacher or principal.<p>I lived in Germany through the fifth grade, and attended German public schools through the fourth grade.  My fourth grade teacher hated me because I was American.  This is not a guess, she literally told me on the first day of school that, unlike all of the other children, I would not be given the benefit of the doubt but would rather have to ""prove myself"" because I was American. She also regularly made negative or disparaging comments about Americans in general.  Based on her age, she must have been in elementary school herself during WWII, and I'm guessing she had some bad experiences.  My parents literally had to have an adversarial relationship with her for my sake, and ended up pulling me out of the German public school system at the end of the year and putting me into a joint German-American school because she would have been my homeroom teacher again the next year (we kept the same teachers for three-year blocks: one set for grades 1-3, another for grades 4-6).<p>When we moved back to the states, they ended up needing to adopt an adversarial relationship with the principal at my new elementary school.  As the ""new kid,"" the top bully had singled me out for special attention.  Any time we had an encounter, no matter how one-sided, the principal would dish out equal punishment to both of us because he was too lazy to figure out the difference between ""two boys fighting on a schoolyard,"" and ""one boy punching another boy in the back of the head repeatedly without warning or provocation.""  Fortunately, the principal was also stupid and craven.  After he suspended both of us one day for an incident where I had not even tried to fight back, I called my parents from the phone in the school library (it was an in-school suspension) and told them what happened.  They promptly called him and asked him to explain the situation.  He told them a bald-faced lie about what had occurred, then called me into his office and yelled at me for daring to call my parents.  Fortunately, my parents hadn't bought his story and had left the house immediately after getting off the phone with him.  We lived close enough to the school that they walked into his office while he was still screaming at me at the top of his lungs.  My father had been home that day so he had come to the school with my mother, and I'm still not sure how my mother kept him from beating that man, but she did.  I was sent back to the library, and after about fifteen minutes I was told my suspension had been rescinded and I went back to class.  After that the principal never looked me in the eye again.  My parents had a series of meetings with the school board and various people at the school district, and at the end of the school year the principal was ""promoted"" to a dead-end administrative job at the superintendent's office.  I don't know the details of what they worked out, but some of the shit he said while yelling at me was completely inexcusable and would not have looked good at all on the front page of the newspaper.",1315504543

If what he says here is true--and I'm certainly inclined to believe it given the flagrantly enjoyed conflicts of interest, lawsuits borne from shady dealing, opportunism (moving residence to Seattle), and egomania--that alone would be just cause to depart, and probably on less-than-friendly terms.<p>Thinking about Arrington reminds me of the story arc on House where the cop goes hard after him for illegal narcotics. At one point he shows up with a warrant at House's residence and finds bags full of Vicodin. He tells House something along the lines of, ""Egotistical people think they're smarter than everyone else. I've already seen you willing to skirt the rules. It's reasonable to conclude you skirt other rules too, like writing your own prescriptions.""<p>Given the public, documented things we know about TC and Arrington, it would beggar belief that he did not use his power to trade favors and influence.",1315504360

I so wish we did.  Grocery delivery is rare in general here too.<p>The UK is already a very mature, maybe even saturated, market for online shopping so something like Ernies would probably never appeal.  It's one of the few examples where UK and rest of Europe is way way ahead of the US.<p>I could write a book on grocery retail in the US vs UK but a lot of it comes down to the fact that grocery stores don't make the same margins that they do in the UK.<p>Ocado works because Waitrose has some of the highest margins on their food because they sell premium high-quality brands and don't compete on price.  Then there is a delivery fee on top of that.  There are enough people in the UK, despite economic issues, that pay for premium groceries at Waitrose and want it delivered by Ocado (perhaps because they don't have a car).<p>Groceries in the US are way way cheaper, perhaps as much as 50% and the margins are lower.  To give you a comparison, the premium grocery chain Whole Foods (which I think we now have a few in London) compares to Sainsburys on price yet the quality is better.  A grocery store with price point of Waitrose or Marks & Spencer wouldn't survive in the US because Americans won't spend that kind of money on groceries.<p>Safeway here in San Francisco will offer home-delivery, but I think it's not something they do in their stores outside of cities, and the quality of the food is awful.<p>But delivery has never been popular in American because car ownership is more common then  in the UK - which is probably why Ernies are choosing not to tackle it.<p>Anyone reading this and not familiar with Ocado should check it out - you'll be amazed at the prices but the quality and service is exceptional.",1315504328

They put them in front of the TV and let other people raise them, i.e., teachers, sitcoms, and the internet. They don't really care about the kids.<p>However, those kids are viewed as an extension of themselves and so any attack on the kids is an attack on them. if you say that the kid has behavioral problems, what the parent hears is that they are a bad parent/person. They don't care about the kid, they care about how it reflects on them. This is the same reason that you have parents beating up and murdering hockey coaches and referees when they pull their kid. In the mind of the parent, the call is against them.<p>We have moved from a society were the entire village raised the kids and parents had the support, training, and coaching they needed. They were raised in an environment in which kids were actually cared for and that was passed onto new parents. Today, we move away from home, most of us don't have contact with parents, grandparents, siblings, etc and we raise kids because they either make us look good or it is simply the expected thing to do. Unfortunately, they don't actually have any understanding of how to raise kids and they are too busy to do a proper job anyway.<p>I am a firm believer that we are getting very close to the day when we will have to issue licences before people are allowed to have kids. Not that we should police who has them, but to ensure that people have the needed support systems and knowledge in place before trying to be parents.",1315502493

But those nutritional benefits aren't unique to Chobani; they're something that all of the Greek yogurts share.  Chobani has somehow managed to grow faster than the rest of the sector.  For instance, Chobani has crushed Fage, the incumbent market leader.  Fage grew 58% last year... which sounds good.  But in the Greek yogurt business if you're not growing 100%, you're not even maintaining your market share.  Chobani grew 258% last year.",1315501816

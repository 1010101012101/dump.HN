Being able to tick off all those checkboxes helps to close the sale.<p>And, indeed, Apple has traditionally had trouble in the corporate space relative to the consumer space.<p>What Apple has managed to do is to break free of the paradigm where hardware and software are primarily designed for the business market, then sold to non-business customers as a sideline.

To do what the programmer requests requires doing things at runtime that are hard to make fast. That's why things like tracing JITs are being used for things like JavaScript.<p>The speedup you get from actually compiling Python programs is because the CPython interpreter is pretty awful, not because compilation is a magic solution to performance problems.

1746823,comment,1734936,1736726,0,0,saurik,,,"tl;dr dpkg models this just fine, thank you very much ;P<p>I don't feel it is accurate to say ""dpkg doesn't support multiple package versions""; let's say it let you install multiple versions of the same package at once: now you are just going to have file-on-file conflicts. From dpkg's perspective these different versions of the same files, which live in different places on the filesystem and can coexist on the same system, are just different packages.<p>The real question I feel the Ruby community should be asking, and thankfully the very question that I have personally heard from Yehuda, is ""why doesn't C feel the need to do this?"". The answer is ""well, they do, but"".<p>For the ""well, they do"" part, we can easily call into evidence that on my system I have both libreadline 5.x and libreadline 6.x: there is a (hilarious) fundamental break between these two versions of the library, leading to them deciding to increase the major version number, which then causes different applications to need to continue linking to one or the other.<p>Therefore, Debian models this: these two major versions of readline are each a separate package, libreadline5 vs libreadline6. You can install them both at the same time: they do not conflict.<p>Now for the ""but"", where the question becomes ""what if I want to install 6.0 and 6.1"" and the answer is ""you don't want to do that, no one wants to do that, that is not something you should want to do"", and this, I feel, is where the conversation starts breaking down with the Ruby community.<p>The reason no one wants to install 6.0 and 6.1 is that there is no reason to: 6.1 is newer and better than 6.0. Meanwhile, software that currently works with 6.0 /will/ work with 6.1. If software that worked with 6.0 didn't work with 6.1 it would not be called 6.1, it would be called 7.0.<p>Now, exactly whether the major version or the second-most major version (libxml2 uses this) or whatever other scheme someone comes up with is used to determine this isn't important. The way it works for C is that the version you are using gets fixed at compile time, which I think people should actually start thinking as analogous to creating their Gemfile.<p>Here's how that works (for Linux gcc with typical paths): the developer of a project passes -lreadline to the compiler. This looks for /usr/lib/libreadline.so, which in turn is a symlink to a file which is named with the ""compatibility version"" (in this case, 5 or 6), which in turn is a symlink to the specific version of the library in question (although there might be some more levels if someone is being silly).<p>/usr/lib/libreadline.a
/usr/lib/libreadline.so -> /lib/libreadline.so.6<p>/lib/libreadline.so.5 -> libreadline.so.5.2
/lib/libreadline.so.5.2
/lib/libreadline.so.6 -> libreadline.so.6.1
/lib/libreadline.so.6.1<p>Then, every binary has in it an ""installed name"" or ""soname"" which is the path to the library that will be encoded in any compiled binaries that have linked against it. This name is based on the compatibility version, and not the specific version, as there is an assumption that versions of the library that have the same compatibility version are, by definition, compatible.<p>So, this means that even though this symlink scheme theoretically supports having 6.0 and 6.1 installed at the same time, it would have no effect: all software wanting 6.x will be linked against libreadline.so.6, which will in turn only be able to point to either 6.0 or 6.1.<p>This assumption is a good thing: it means that we can upgrade libraries. People should not be wondering whether upgrading to 6.1 will break their program: if it does then the person who released 6.1 is not doing their job right, and there is a bug in that library that needs to be considered critical.<p>Luckily, system integrators such as Debian go to great lengths to test and verify that these libraries really are as compatible as they claim. This sometimes gets them into really hot water, however, as if upstream goes nuts and starts breaking their ABI, even slightly, Debian either needs to fix that bug or not take the update: it is not acceptable to Debian to allow an incompatible release of readline into the ecosystem, as it will have unpredictable consequences on the software that is using it.<p>That assumption is really important: there is no ""we came really close, but some random things have changed that you now need to go fix"". The idea in this world is that there is no good reason for that: there could be an arbitrarily large number of people who are relying on that feature, so it is irresponsible to unilaterally decide that you can just change it, even if it makes more sense.<p>This belief that ""incompatibilities are serious bugs"" leads to a number of common C idioms. To draw a few examples: * rather than change old APIs, add new ones; * rather than changing structures every now and then, use version numbers to tell different users apart; * use C for public external interfaces over C++ (which tends to have ABI fragility problems on most platforms) whenever possible.<p>Given this belief, if libreadline6 comes out, you also would never even consider using it in place of libreadline5 without going back to the source code to try to verify if it works (at least compiling it, but there may also be semantic issues at work in the API). With this belief in mind the idea of using ~> (which Yehuda has to spend a lot of time convincing people of) becomes ""obvious"": if a major version number (which unfortunately is not what ~> correctly models, but at least it is better than nothing to get the idea out there) changes, your package should not assume that will work.<p>You also find yourself being really happy that there is someone in the ecosystem--Debian in this case--who is doing all of that really hard, incredibly grueling, and (apparently) often thankless job of standing at the gates making certain software doesn't just willy-nilly enter the ecosystem until it has been reasonably regression tested. The developer's goal is, sadly, not always aligned with the grand unified vision, and that's what the users of these systems are buying in to (and I'll even go so far as to say: and that is where most of the value is, not the individual software projects).<p>Ok, </rant>. ;P (If anyone is curious: the reason libreadline5 and libreadline6 are incompatible with each other is actually that 5.x is GPLv2 and 6.x is GPLv3; afaik, and I'll admit I might be wrong, not only is the API between these two major versions identical, but so is their ABI: only in the world of politics and legalities was there an interface break. It still makes a simple example that a lot of people have run in to, though. ;P)",1285936619

1746770,comment,1745856,1745856,0,0,RBr,,,"Here is what I think you should do:<p>1)
Do some research online about legitimate ways to make money.  Make a very long list with no fewer than 100 entries.  These don't need to be things that you're interested in, but each one needs to result in some form of income.  None of these things should cost any money to make money <i>or</i> require you to pimp out your friends and family for referrals.  Don't limit yourself online either, remember that people earn money in easy ways offline as well and that something as easy as personal shopping for an elderly person in your neighborhood can bring in $50 a week for something you're doing anyway.  Be creative and constantly add to this list.<p>2)
Create profiles, sign up or apply to each one of these money making methods.  In some cases, you'll need to create basic websites (storefronts), etc to facilitate income.  Do not spend any more than 4 hours of a single day stetting up any single method.<p>3)
Start thinking about a portfolio.  It doesn't matter what life goals you have, you need a portfolio - especially if you're going to be earning money this way.  Think about what your ""perfect"" job / gig / startup looks like and carefully collect items for your portfolio that support your expertise in your target area.  Opportunistic portfolio work is the only type of work you should ever do cheap or free.<p>4)
I bet you have already started to do these things.  You've identified 4 very general things on your website that you can do.  However, you've put out a general call for work in common areas.  Think about your skills (starting with the 4 you've listed) and look at the looong list of money making opportunities.<p>5) Once you get a couple of bucks in your pocket and you get the bill collectors (if any) off of your back, a really fun experiment is to have your bills paid by passive income.  One-by-one, if you can slowly discard one bill at a time using things like affiliate programs, ad income from your blog, whatever... you'll really start to have fun.  The only rule in this ""game"" is to define a small number of maintenance hours per week to maintain your passive income.  The natural progression of passive income using this strategy is to take an item from your looong list of income sources and modularize / mechanize it to reduce the amount of labor it takes to complete the task to the absolute minimum.  Sometimes, leveraging the low cost labor of others to preform tasks that are easy to repeat is a great way to move a task completely passive.<p>6) Above all else, keep your chin up.  Remember the setbacks and failures but don't let them put you in a bad mood.  Staying upbeat and creative is the key.",1285935243

If greater compression can be reached by leaving out the alpha, and if there's no compelling reason to put it in, it should be left out. 'why not' is not a reason, there needs to be a business case for each feature, in everything.<p>In my experience, and this seems to be a widely held position, the main use case for jpgs  is in pictures, as in photographs. The main use case for png (gif) is for graphical elements: borders, menus, etc. Those last ones you want to compress with a lossless format anyway - you need to be sure that a flat menu background is not dithered or doesn't have other artifacts. I understand the question mostly as 'do you need transparency in photographs' and 'do you need non-rectangular photographs where the non-rectangular nature is encoded in the photograph itself, and not part of another rendering in stage in the presentation layer'.<p>Thinking about it more, maybe things like drop shadows or other fancy borders could be case where you need transparency in photos. Otherwise you have to work around it by having the picture as jpg and the border as a separate (or several separate) png's. More requests, harder layouting, etc. I'm not convinced yet that this use case alone is a compelling argument.<p>As for technical reasons to not implement it, I don't know - I'm assuming there are because I'm quite sure that someone at Google must've thought about it and decided against it, they must have had their reasons.<p>(1) I'm reasoning from the assumption that including transparency has adverse effects on file size and/or decompression complexity.

Programming blogs don't monetize well,  for quite a few reasons:<p>* Many programmers refuse to buy software and other programming tools
* Outside of a few special enclaves,  programming is a relatively low status and low paid occupation.  (Yes,  you'll find people in the valley who get paid $120k a year,  but every one-horse town has a job shop that wishes it could pay programmers $30k a year and may or may not offer health insurance...  Sure they get turnover,  but they think they'll make it up in volumes)
* Programming blogs attract a lot of people from India and other developing countries who are very poorly paid,  cheap and don't have credit cards anyway
* There's just too many programming blogs...  The cost ofadvertising is set by supply and demand if there's a lot of inventory and not enough advertising,  the price is going to be low<p>What to do?  You may (or may not) be able to double your revenue by making your ads more intrusive;  if you make your blog look like hell, you'll lose the social traffic,  however.<p>The best things to do are:<p>* Not blog.  Permanent content that attracts search traffic pays better than blogs that are driven by social traffic.  Blogs aren't all bad,  because (1) you write a lot of content and (2) the social traffic results in a lot of links which helps you in search,  but a search-first strategy is better still.
* Pick another topic.  One reason so many people make so little money on ads is that 80% of content creators create content about 20% of the topics.  If you put on a blindfold and threw darts at a thesaurus,  you'd find something that monetizes better than the average fool who ""follows his passion""<p>Oh yeah,  if you need to ""make money fast"" don't forget the value of your domain name.

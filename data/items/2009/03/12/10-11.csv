The IM/email interface works for me and ""subjective search"" will be big (if done right).<p>The only issue: since subjective search is very much a 2-way (person2person) transaction, medium/long term, what is my incentive to keep answering questions with no economic gain?",1236854377

I'm sure it's possible, but it certainly wasn't at all difficult to do in XP, so I wasn't too impressed with that. Maybe if the machine stayed up longer I would have figured it out eventually.<p>Hopefully the next beta or RC will work for me.",1236853409

513251,comment,512846,513135,0,0,pavlov,,,"It seems like the analog clock widget is the perennial ""Hello World"" of slightly more advanced GUI applications. Anyone can implement it (no spec required), it's somewhat fun to write, and it works as a test for some of the more essential APIs in a GUI operating system such as vector graphics and timer events.<p>I think there's also a psychological aspect involved. The analog clock may be popular precisely because it's inefficient in the ways you described. Including it in a computer operating system may be an attempt to communicate that the system's designers want to respect traditional GUI values like user-centric design and real-world metaphors; that it's the kind of system where they don't mind spending CPU cycles on an inefficient information element as long as it breaks the monotony of text-based interfaces and offers a small tinge of familiarity. (The analog clock is something that you wouldn't find on a 1984 IBM system.)",1236852760

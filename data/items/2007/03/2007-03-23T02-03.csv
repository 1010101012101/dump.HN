Clearly your employer just doesn't buy the concept at all. They probably only offer 3 weeks (slightly higher than average) as a recruiting incentive, which is pretty dishonest if they don't actually let you use it.<p>The reasoning behind this concept is what's important. It's about treating employees as equal partners in a relationship, as opposed to children, like most employers do.<p>Definitely read this essay if you havent:  <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/opensource.html"">http://paulgraham.com/opensource.html</a>",1174617921

5856,comment,5802,5802,0,0,rfrey,,,"To me the interesting sites are those the author would call ugly by design (i.e, not the ones that are ugly because there was no money to hire a designer, or because the programmer thought he was a designer.)<p>But with those, I think bueno misses the point: these sites represent the edge of design.  They are designers trying to create something unique, trying to find a spark.  When successful, it's usually a small crowd that ""gets it"": they're passionate about it while many, maybe even a majority, hate it.  If it's truly good, eventually the majority gets converted.  I'm in the majority with the Honda Element, for example: to my shock I'm beginning to come around.<p>Most edge design, though, IS ugly, will gain only hedging admiration from the designer's mother and averted gazes from his wife.  But it's not intended to be bad, it's intended to be revolutionary.",1174616841

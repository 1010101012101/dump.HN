6453238,comment,6446328,6452206,1,0,VladRussian2,,,"sorry, somehow partial text got submitted.<p>>The glib answer here is that there&#x27;s really no such thing as the 2nd law when you&#x27;re talking about a small number of individual fundamental particles. The statement &quot;entropy never decreases&quot; is actually a purely statistical claim, and it only rises to its usual level of essentially unbreakable validity when you&#x27;re dealing with macroscopic numbers of particles<p>All the fundamental laws of physics, including the Schrodinger equation, follow the 2nd law or in other words they describe application of 2nd law to the given area of physics, i.e. they express &quot;entropy never decreases&quot; principle in terms of the objects of that physical area.<p>>&quot;there is less &quot;phase space&quot; available (fewer possible momentum states)&quot;<p>ie. less entropy :)<p>>an electron and positron are electrically attracted to each other and will naturally tend to meet up to annihilate<p>2 particles having negative and positive charges - less entropy than the entropy of 2 resulting neutral particles. Attraction (getting closer - increasing entropy) and annihilation (erasing the charge difference - increasing entropy) are in full compliance with, and i&#x27;d say direct manifestation of, the 2nd law :)",1380225566

The Government have all powerful multiple secret service organization that works full time to make sure there is no serious threat to the government status quo (among other things), under the pretence of national security.<p>- I can go on say that the actions of the government should not make the people of the country complacent of their crimes.

We do not directly observe review fraud, and we clearly spell this out in the paper. The 20% figure represents the percentage of filtered reviews on Yelp. These are reviews that Yelp finds suspicious enough to not publish. Some filtered reviews may be fake, and some might just be false positives. Similarly, Yelp&#x27;s filter might miss some fake reviews, and end up publishing them. (See <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/faq#filter_wrong"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yelp.com/faq#filter_wrong</a>). I hope this makes the distinction between fake and filtered clear.<p>Our main goal with this paper was to analyze the economic incentives behind review fraud, and for this we used filtered reviews as a proxy for fake reviews. bobf provides a good summary of our key findings so I won&#x27;t repeat them.

For low value bulk crops (corn, wheat, soybeans) the robot is too expensive and existing mechanization is too good.  Even for high value stuff (grapes and other fruit) it will be too expensive.  Maybe inside a highly controlled greenhouse this will be practical, but there are no food crops that are economical to grow inside a greenhouse.  (It is getting there as high-tunnel becomes cheaper to install.)<p>As an aside, mechanical harvesters for grapes are hilarious.  You still need people to run them.  One person&#x27;s job is to find and remove possums from the fruit bin before the critter is buried by a thousand pounds of fruit.<p>It is a distraction to talk about the gantry, XY or radial.  Any gantry based system is going to be a headache from the start because you&#x27;ve got those rails cluttering up the space.   Eventually you&#x27;ll find something the robot cannot do and then you&#x27;ll be trying to figure out how to get your general purpose tractor around without crushing the gantry.<p>The radial system is cute, except now your installation and operating costs scale linearly with the amount of crops.  With an XY system, one can plant more and extend the rails and have the existing robots do more work.  Not possible with the radial system, unless you are going to physically pick up and move the units between circles few times each day.  If time is tight (plague of locusts coming in tomorrow, need more robots to squish them) you can increase the robot density by sliding more robots onto the XY gantry.  Not possible with radial.<p>Ultimately it will be about the vision processing and manipulators.  And then you might as well mount the vision/manipulator unit on a tractor and have a robot-tractor drive up and down the fields, just like any other piece of equipment.  Vastly cheaper and more flexible than gantries.<p>Eventually we will get there, but it probably won&#x27;t be until vision processing and lidar gets a whole lot cheaper.  We might be on the cusp though, based on the computer vision advances in video gaming.<p>User roryaronson, I&#x27;ve done a lot with robotics and outdoor electronics too.

She didn&#x27;t really provide medical care, she referred to her facilities as &quot;houses of the dying&quot; and their suffering was a good thing as it brought them closer to God so pain management was basically non existent. There are reams of statements from medical professionals, Indian and Western, that visited her facilities and the general consensus was that they were &quot;horrifying&quot; and lacked even the most basic attention to cleanliness.<p>She did feed a lot of people, but not many compared to other charities operating in the same places that had smaller budgets.<p>I also can&#x27;t dismiss the fact that she used her reputation to support war criminals like the Duvalier family, although in other comments you do dismiss this so ... sure, I&#x27;ll just concentrate on the rest.<p>If you do believe in the christian afterlife then perhaps she is a great person as she probably did convert a lot of sick people in India as they suffered and became more likely to accept Jesus as their saviour. If you don&#x27;t then she let poor people die unnecessarily and intentionally heaped unnecessary suffering on the poor.<p>So like I said, definitely, unequivocally, based on her own statements alone, she is not a good canonical example of selfless altruism since a good canonical example would not be judged only by a fringe sect of Christianity that looks to enhance the suffering of the poor.",1380223119

The problem arises that in many cases, the defendant holds the cards when it comes to evidence showing wrongdoing.<p>The examples are replete. Consider the recent financial scandals. You may sincerely believe that you were defrauded by a bank, but to prove fraud you need to show fraudulent intent. I.e. you need e-mails between the banks&#x27; employees saying &quot;hey, we&#x27;re going to screw this guy over.&quot; Well you can&#x27;t get those e-mails until you initiate litigation, and under loser pays you&#x27;re on the hook if, e.g., the bankers were smart and did their scheming by passing paper notes.<p>Or say you have a products liability litigation. You think a car company skimped on some part knowing it would compromise safety. Who has the internal testing data that might prove that claim?<p>Or say you have an environmental litigation. You think someone is dumping pollutants in your river and making people sick. Who has the internal logs that might prove that?<p>One of the purposes of litigation is investigation--getting evidence that may prove or disprove your claim.

As the Twombly court described it - The &quot;[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true.&quot; What this ends up requiring is that the plaintiff state specific factual allegations as to what the defendant is actually doing wrong. This sounds like a pretty good idea but in many cases is much more difficult than you&#x27;d think. Usually the difficultly arises because the information that supports your complaint, i.e. what the defendant is doing wrong, is totally within their control. You, as a plaintiff bringing an action, do not have access to this information until discovery starts, which is only after the complaint and an answer have been filed.<p>Think of it this way. You have a patent. You&#x27;re pretty sure, but not positive, someone is infringing on it. Without the ability to inspect the supposed infringer&#x27;s facilities, how do you plead with particularity factual allegations sufficient to support an infringment claim? If the infringment is blatent, sure this is easy. But in more nuanced cases (I can&#x27;t think of a technical exmaple) it is possible to end up in a siuation where actual infringment is occuring but because of an inability to access the right information there is not enough available to sufficiently plead a claim.",1380222652

You can send a kid to school for four years and he still more economically useful than a plumber&#x27;s apprentice. If you take work away from the busy people and give it to the less busy people, the net result is an overall lowering of quality.<p>This problem does not seem to be surmountable with the level of social infrastructure we have. I doubt even more societies with a greater level of public organization, like Norway, could do this. Knowledge and experience are just best when hoarded.",1380222579

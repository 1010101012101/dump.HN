673493,comment,673035,673185,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Actually, the toaster company only engages in central planning of toaster <i>assembly</i>. They plan almost nothing else.<p>Where do they get their iron from? Commodities markets. If I'm not mistaken, even the name of the seller is abstracted away from them (by the financial services industry, which is also not planned by the toaster company).<p>The manufactured parts (e.g. the plug and switched) may actually require them to care who they purchase from, but all the planning is done by someone else.<p>And the distribution channels are also, for the most part, handled by someone else. The company sends toasters to Walmart by the truckload, distribution is up to walmart from there on. Maybe the company sends some advertising materials, but that's about it.<p>The toaster company does engage in planning, but only a little bit. The rest is left up to the markets.",1245930742
673492,comment,673035,673378,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"Capitalism with strong state control is called Mercantilism. Or proto-capitalism, if you want. A few hundred years ago the main tools used today existed already: banks, loans, stocks, contracts of all kinds. The main difference was that the state believed (much like in a lot of third-world countries today) that tight regulation is normal and necessary. The moment the main source of income shifted from agriculture to industry and commerce was the moment the state started to use it for its own purposes (which usually were war related).<p>Not surprisingly, it did not work very well. Regulations went as far as dictate the type of products which could be produced, by whom and with what technology. Any newcomer had to obtain licence first and start production later, and any company which had an advantage in inovation only was pretty dead from the start. The incumbents always fought tooth and nail to keep things as they are, and since they had the support of the state they usually succeeded. In one extreme case this meant the execution of 16,000 small entrepreneurs whose only crime was importing or manufacturing cotton cloth in violation of French law. (last sentence is copy paste from Wikipedia).<p>Now, again, except the state control the economic climate looked surprisingly like today. Which is why there are still countries that proclaim to be capitalist, even when in practice it's impossible to build a successful business without political support. The difference is not semantic, it is very real.<p>Try and google a bit for Hernando de Soto. I haven't found exactly what I was looking for, but this is ok:

673489,comment,671592,673242,0,0,froo,,,"<i>""@froo, you do have a point, but revenue is not profit.""</i><p>Fine, let's investigate that.<p>MS's profit for:
  2008 = $37.9 billion
  2007 = $32.6 billion
  2006 = $27.81 billion<p>.. and so on, I can't be bothered entering in the rest of the figures, but the trend is that MS's profit aswell as revenue are increasing year over year (It will be a different tune this year, but that's because of the economic slowdown, not a business failing on MS's part). So you're wrong. They appear to give about half of this profit to their shareholders each year.<p><i>""I don't know of many companies that still sell prepackaged software.""</i><p>You mean like Oracle, Autodesk, Adobe, Apple, SAP... should I go on?<p><i>PCs will be soon surpassed by smart-phones.</i><p>I don't think desktop computing will be replaced any time soon - whether that be a PC, notebook or a netbook is a different matter, but there will be room for desktop computing for a long time to come. Smartphones might have a lot going for them, but they lack the tactile feedback of a keyboard, mouse and screen combo. Almost nobody in their right mind will be using smartphones in lieu of a desktop computer for their day to day work. It's just not going to happen, sorry.<p><i>""And btw ... FUD is not an incorrect statement, neither something you disagree with. FUD is an incorrect statement done with a clear intent to discredit a competitor""</i><p>Actually, FUD is not necessarily used to discredit competitors as it has a much broader use in language today. Individuals (or organisations) who spread untrue, inaccurate or poorly researched information knowingly with the intent of discrediting an organisation or person can be said to be spreading FUD. It's even more apparent when somebody does it with a clear bias (which you obviously have a general negative bias with MS, despite you using .net), sort of like propaganda, because if you had spent 2 or 3 minutes to look at MS's annual reports, you would see your argument is wrong.<p><i>""I do have the tendency to check my assumptions from time to time""</i><p>Just not this time, not even in the slightest bit.",1245930554

Well, let's do a little analysis of that shall we. I have the fastest home connection available in my country - 24 mbit adsl. My max download speeds are around 2mb/s down and 70kb/sec up.<p>So, assuming I am downloading a 50mb file from a friend and he has a similar connection to mine, it would take about 11 minutes to download directly from him, or 1.5 minutes to download from rapidshare (which includes the 60 second wait time).... no contest. When you're sharing files with multiple people, this becomes more apparent which is the superior solution.<p><i>""This video is not available in your country""</i><p>Well I live in Australia, we have some of the most restrictive distribution deals when it comes to media content and I've only ever seen those kinds of messages from places like the TV networks and Hulu. I don't think this really applies to peer content, so the point is moot.<p><i>""Your account has been banned because we say so"".</i><p>If you're sharing illegal content or content that is of a questionable nature, then of course you're going to get banned. Either way, the point still stands about the speeds given a lot of this content would be video, which doesn't really scale for home connections.<p><i>""You are also limited by some laws that normaly don't apply to you, because service is located in other country.""</i><p>You would also be limited by the exact same laws if someone is downloading from your computer who lives in another country.<p><i>""You often have to deal with popups""</i><p>None of the sites I linked above showed me a popup when I visited them to make sure all the links work....<p><i>""and ugly banners.""</i><p>So far, the only valid point you've made.... and that is easily avoidable with adblockers.<p><i>""Speed might be the only problem""</i><p>Well, it's a pretty big problem if you want to share on any kind of scale.<p><i>""but sometimes freedom is worth it.""</i><p>Freedom how?

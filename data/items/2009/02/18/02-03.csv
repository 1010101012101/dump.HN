Whereas much of the ""clamor for tech people"" is from business guys who need tech people just to get started, so they are desperate for anybody.",1234925810

Nobody has done it because it's too easy? Eh? It's ridiculous and counter to the point of programming in general to suggest people ought to keep reinventing something because it's easy to do so.<p>Even worse, if it is easy, then it's merely a distraction not a challenge - causing you to lose where you were in your program while you think about reinventing an easy wheel.<p>Not that I believe it for a minute - implementing a good library to do something complex isn't easy - I just don't think ""I want a script to process email, I could use Python and start with 'import email, pop' or I could go with Lisp and reimplement a POP client and an SMTP/MIME email parser it'll only take a minute"".",1234925265

485290,comment,484855,485062,0,0,jerf,,,"A lot of that has already been done. In the web browsing context, when you ask for something and get a 304 Not Modified back because your cached copy is still current, that's basically compressing away the entire content of that object, which may be huge.<p>Your other idea has been done, too, with ""WAN optimization"", but it generally isn't helpful for one person, because you already have good caching and proxying going on, even if you don't realize it. That works when multiple people are pulling down the same contents.<p>Basically, already done.<p>At this point, if you start going ""But what if we also did <i>this</i>...!"", you are about 95% likely to start getting into the compression crackpot zone. Information can only be squeezed so hard and once you start proposing other exotic solutions the only explanation that works in response is usually ""No, that won't work, but you won't believe me, so, prove it. Implement it and sell it for millions of dollars. Be sure to count <i>all</i> the bytes, not just the ones you like."" And generally, that's the end of that.<p>I am far more likely to believe that you have built a working anti-gravity device, which is at least at the very edge of plausibility under certain not-yet-disproven physical theories, than that you have actually made a huge compression advance, which is effectively mathematically impossible. (Not because compression can't be advanced, but because it's only going to advance <i>incrementally</i> from now on. There's no room left for a breakthrough <i>in the general case</i>.)",1234924906

485279,comment,484518,485063,0,0,zmimon,,,"I think you are half right but you are a little harsh.<p>The Java eco-system evolved to solve some problems that really are hard, not just simple problems.   However you are totally right about the complexity - the real issue is that the complexity introduced by the solutions often equalled or surpassed the complexity of the original problems themselves.   And even worse, often people didn't need the problems solved in the first place, but Java gave you the complexity anyway.<p>So, for example, it is nearly as hard or even harder to learn the JEE specs and all the ins and outs of the java app servers that implement them as it is to solve the subset of those problems you care about generically yourself.",1234923411

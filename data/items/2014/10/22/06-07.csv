What a coincidence to come across this comment.<p>I have to say I&#x27;m really enjoying reading through it! I&#x27;ve only tried the triangular-face-image test so far, with mixed results (the baby pooped which derailed the experiment a bit). But I&#x27;m looking forward to doing more as he grows up.<p>I appreciate that it&#x27;s actually full of real science about child development, and written with some rigor.

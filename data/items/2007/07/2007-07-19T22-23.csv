35419,comment,35409,35417,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Agreed.  Joe and Blake are two of the smartest guys in the field.  Crazily productive to boot.<p>I'm a little surprised by the direction of the acquisition (I would have expected someone bigger than Facebook to be the buyer) but not that one happened quickly.  (I predicted that Zenter would not be the last acquisition this year from the WFP07 group.)",1184885743

35413,comment,35337,35400,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Flip side is that users who comment a lot on popular stories but don't post much tend to get overcounted.  My karma/post is like 25-30, but only because I get the majority of my karma from comments.  My posts themselves average like 5 points.<p>I've picked up literally 100 karma in the last week or so, yet made only one submission in the last month.  A couple popular comments can heavily distort the averages.",1184884020
35412,comment,35255,35359,0,0,garbowza,,,"No, even under ""first to file"" you cannot patent something where publicly accessible prior art exists. You can never patent something if it already exists in the public. The difference in first to file is that you can't pull up internal, private (i.e. NOT public) documents after the fact and say ""look, here's proof I did it first"" even though nobody could access that document.",1184884012

35410,comment,35232,35355,0,0,myoung8,,,"Agreed. It's logical too. Most high schoolers and college students have a very small network of friends, acquaintances, family, etc. (in relative terms).<p>Once you get into the real world, you have to deal with people all over the place, oftentimes whom you've never met before. That's when email becomes truly useful.<p>Alternative hypothesis: after college, people aren't as concerned with appearing ""cool,"" so Facebook Wall Posts really don't matter much anymore.",1184882611

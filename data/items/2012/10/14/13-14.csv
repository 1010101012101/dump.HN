4651452,comment,4650373,4650756,2,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"I agree with the fact that most of the benefits are going to X, but I'm not at all sure that the cost is being borne by Y, where Y is defined by the poor and middle class. I say this because the reality is that the poor and a big chunk of the middle class in this country do not pay any Federal income tax, which is where the cost of this will be paid from. The lion's share of this will probably be borne in the end by Z, which are the upper middle class and wealthy with earned income who pay the highest marginal tax rates and a huge share of the tax revenue. In fact, the top 20% of households pay 94% of the Federal income tax [1]. They're the ones who are going to pay for this boondoggle, and while that does include hedge fund managers and Donald Trump, it also includes dentists and professors and small business owners.<p>Of course, this is all just debt right now, so who knows what will end up happening. But given the conversation happening in this country right now, I can't see a big change in the 20% / 94% number above.<p>1. <a href=""http://taxfoundation.org/blog/top-20-percent-households-pay-94-percent-income-taxes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://taxfoundation.org/blog/top-20-percent-households-pay-...</a>",1350223150

The first was Family Album, which launched in the summer of 2011, a product that enabled users to create and co-curate photo albums together. The other, D Series, was an app that aimed to capture a retro, disposable camera experience on the iPhone. Friends could purchase various packs of digital cameras together for 99 cents, and take and share up to 24 shots per roll--before having to buy another pack of cameras. It was definitely a reaction to the social photography wave, Polkus says. The products were in response to people saying, Okay, well we can take pictures, but how do other people see them without using Instagram</i><p>It's bad enough that they didn't realize the bottoming out of the paid app market (who could justify paying $1.99 for Hipstamatic when Instagram offered the same product...and angry birds was just $.99?), but their pivots toward social were incredibly dumb.",1350223019

4651430,comment,4649998,4651211,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"<i>""It provides only extremely weak support for that hypothesis. A reasonable prior expectation is that it is unlikely for a randomly selected group of young children to share a mistrust of adults that would carry on throughout their lives.""</i><p>I think you misunderstand gizmo686's point. My reading (of gizmo686's post as well as the study) is that this is not about a question of merely the individual child's responses but also about their environment, which at the age of 3 is going to be primarily controlled by their parents. It's not just a matter of whether a child who grows up mistrusting the world is at a disadvantage. It's more that a child who grows up in a world that is untrustworthy is at a disadvantage.<p>Let me be blunt, we are talking about shitty parents. Or, to tone it down one notch, less capable parents. On the one hand you have parents who can provide for their children, who are attentive to their needs, etc. Those parents will tend to raise children better, and will tend to raise children who grow up to be more successful. On the other hand you have parents who let their children down often, are unable to provide for them as well, make promises that go unfulfilled, etc. Those parents will tend to raise children less well, and will tend to raise children who grow up and have more problems in life, problems finding jobs, problems with law enforcement, problems with relationships, etc.<p>In broad strokes this is essentially what the second experiment is trying to show that the first experiment is testing. By intentionally priming children to either be trusting or untrusting of their immediate environment and of adults they show that they can control the outcome of the marshmallow experiment. And that in turn leads to the argument that perhaps it is a similar degree of priming (through the ongoing experiences with their family) and the underlying level of trust for adults that is being tested in the first experiment.<p>It's not an ironclad experiment but it's an interesting hypothesis, certainly, and at the very least it unravels some of the overly simplistic interpretations of the first marshmallow experiment.",1350221931

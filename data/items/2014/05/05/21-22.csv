I&#x27;ll give the pedantic, stupid example.<p>Guy wants to kill people for fun.<p>Everyone tells the guy it&#x27;s not allowed.<p>The guy tries to do it anyways.<p>Any sane implementation of anarchocapitalism provides a legal mechanism for forcing violent dude to not kill other people. That legal mechanism has to be defined and staffed. The process for doing that is a political system.<p>Forcing people to do something against their will is not irrational or violent. It&#x27;s inevitable and that&#x27;s good.<p>> ...is not a political system<p>> ...it&#x27;s not a political ideology<p>This is the rabbit hole definition game I was referring to. You&#x27;re just wrong per the standard use of both words. Worse, you&#x27;re quibbling over definitions when the essence of my argument is absolutely clear.<p>> That the ideas are well thought out and practical are demonstrated by citing historical precedents that are similar<p>Right, you just keep ignoring my many, many arguments that these historical examples <i>are not similar</i>.<p>> I&#x27;d be interested to hear your ideas on what you see as superior to the status quo<p>Democratically selected reforms to specific problems with solutions selected on the basis of scientific discussion of the evidence.<p>I have an aversion to &quot;silver bullets&quot; and radical departures, especially those that make extreme claims for which there could never, ever be satisfiable evidence. Even if the idea is good, claiming that you <i>know</i> things will work out because you &quot;thought through the common objections&quot; is nothing more than conjecture and blind faith. There are always good answers to every single argument. There is no way to know how a society will behave, and the central implicit assumption tying everything together is almost always &quot;everyone is like me and wants to live in a world I would like living in&quot;. Which of course is never ever true.<p>There are much simpler systems whose behavior we cannot predict. Any scientifically-minded person would concede this point, and for that reason would not even venture to offer an &quot;alternative&quot; to something as radical as anarchocapitalism other than &quot;I choose the middle option&quot;.<p>And FWIW your appeal to &quot;game-theoretic principles&quot; proves my earlier point regarding implicit assumptions. People behave sub-optimally and violate game theoretic axioms of every variety. People are not formal logical systems, and you can&#x27;t model the dynamics of human relationships using these tools except in extremely limited contexts. And that&#x27;s setting aside the (probable) fact that most people who understand the literature on game theory well (oh, I&#x27;m probably one of them; it&#x27;s not an area I understand well, but I try to keep up with conference proceedings related to my work) do not consider it a reasonable basis for governance or societal organization.<p>> simply shooting down alternatives without offering other systems is de facto support of the status quo.<p>Believing this is why revolutionaries have a nasty tendency of chopping off the heads of lots of people they should essentially agree and get along with on the majority of issues.",1399326923

It implies that because Google has (apparently) figured out how to serve content (and videos) to Comcast customers, that Netflix must be doing something wrong because they can&#x27;t (or won&#x27;t) do the same thing.<p>Well, here&#x27;s the thing... if a Comcast customer can&#x27;t access Google, then &quot;the Internet is broken&quot;, and that customer is likely to call Comcast customer service. Which costs Comcast money.<p>Plus, Google provides a lot of services that don&#x27;t directly compete with Comcast&#x27;s own offerings.  I don&#x27;t think anyone would consider Youtube to be a suitable replacement for watching TV.<p>However, Netflix is competing directly with one of Comcast&#x27;s major offerings (regular TV and video-on-demand too).  In fact, that&#x27;s really all they do.  So Comcast doesn&#x27;t have much financial incentive to help Netflix, and a lot of incentives not to.<p>Ditto all of that for Yahoo and the other major sites.

7701411,comment,7698502,7701109,4,0,valarauca1,,,"Honestly I have to ask are you a troll? You understand how insurance works right? Basically your hedging a long term bet that and event you are insuring against won&#x27;t take place.<p>Lets take life insurance for example, its very cheap on say 20 year olds, who are active, non-smokers. Because overall a 20 year old, active, non-smoker has a much lower chance of dropping dead over night then say a 80 year old active, non-smoker. Its pretty simple stats honestly.<p>Insuring a HDD for 20+ years is the equivalent of buying a 350 year life insurance policy for a human. Statically its pretty safe to say that policy will payout.<p>If you buy a policy that <i>will statically</i> pay out, it means the policy total needs to be collected before the event will likely take place, therefore result in a net profit for the provider.<p>:.:.:<p>Example<p>So you take out a 30 year protection policy on a 2TB hard drive, this policy will pay 50 million dollars. 80% of Hard Drives fail in 4 years, which means as an insurer you need to collect AT LEAST 80% of the policy pay out by year 4 of the devices life cycle. This means you&#x27;ll expect payments of ~1.041 million a month (at least). For the insurer to break even on your policy over an infinite amount of hard drives (which they&#x27;re likely using a finite model), so a lot more.<p>Now you take a 30 year tape drive, for 50 million dollars. 1% of drives fail after 30 years. This means you can collect the total 50 million from at least 100 different contracts, meaning within 30 years each policy will only collect ~5 millions dollars in payments (13k montly payments)<p>The former seems completely idiotic to both the insurance agency <i>AND</i> the business asking for it. I don&#x27;t know what your point is.<p>:.:.:<p>TL;DR: For insurance to work (profitably for both parties) you can&#x27;t have the certainty of the event occurring within the policies term.",1399325420

7701408,comment,7700192,7700192,6,0,rcamera,,,"Having been using DDG as my primary search engine for pretty much 6 years now, I really disliked the new redesign.<p>As mentioned in another comment, the contrast is really bad, I find it hard to read and focus on a given result. This is much worse when using f.lux.<p>I also disliked the left-align on everything, I rather have it centered as it currently is. When using big widescreen monitors there is a lot of whitespace in the middle of the screen and the results show up all the way to the lower left corner... It is pretty uncomfortable to look all the way there and this makes it harder on the contrast part too because there is so much bright light already coming from the background and the font color is a light greyish. This is specially worse in multi-monitor setups.<p>The image and video search tabs are great, and I really like the fact they replace zero-click results when you click on them, but I wouldn&#x27;t leave them in the fixed header, there is just no need for them to be there. This would reduce the size of the fixed header and make it even better.<p>When scrolling results using j and k, the greyish background it adds to each result makes the contrast even worse. I remember when they were yellowish, they were better back then, imo. But current design works too. I also miss the current border around it, it makes it much easier for you to find yourself if you are switching tabs and going back to the results page. I haven&#x27;t measured, but the font also seems a couple pixels smaller, is it?<p>It is also harder to distinguish between results. It all seems like a blob of text, hard to skim through results looking just at the title. In the current design this is fantastically easy, given titles are blue. I only read stuff below the title if the title is of interest. In the new design this is much harder to do, there is not enough contrast between the title and the text under it. Keep it blue, there is absolutely no reason to change this.",1399325399

This is one reason why cars drive on air inflated rubber tires instead of solid metal ones.  It&#x27;s also one reason why trains are more efficient than cars, they have a VERY smooth &quot;road&quot; to travel on and thus don&#x27;t lose any energy to up-and-down movement.<p>If you believe that suspension losses are trivial then I invite you to find a road with rumble strips (to wake up sleepy drivers who slowly veer off the road) and to ride it on a road bike with skinny tires at a very high pressure.  Then ride it again with a non-suspended (or locked out) mountain bike with it&#x27;s much larger tires.  Then ride it again with a mountain bike with a suspension.<p>Here is an informal study doing precisely that for different sizes of road bike tires:  <a href=""http://janheine.wordpress.com/2012/08/12/suspension-losses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://janheine.wordpress.com/2012/08/12/suspension-losses/</a><p>You&#x27;ll find that the pedaling losses from a suspension might get swamped by the benefits.  So it turns out that the optimal solution is relative.  Furthermore a person in a wheelchair isn&#x27;t going to have the same kind of 60-120 RPM cadence (1-2Hz, but then double it since there are two legs, so 2-4Hz) that a cyclist would.  You can do a lot of higher frequency bump reduction for wheelchairs and not sap the users energy for the wheel-push stroke which takes multiple seconds.<p>What this really has to do with is the size of the surface texture relative to the size of the wheels and the ability of the tire to deform.  A lot of wheel-chairing happens on sidewalks which are fairly smooth but have expansion joints every 3-10 feet. Or on blacktop which is smooth relative to a car&#x27;s tires which are air inflated but not relative to a wheelchair&#x27;s which are solid rubber.  Or what about older concrete, or tile, or one of any of the other myriad surfaces which aren&#x27;t perfectly flat?<p>> Even if the article&#x27;s claims of somehow increasing efficiency by adding suspension were true, I&#x27;ll be they&#x27;d be more than negated by the added weight on the wheels.<p>It all depends on the kind of riding you do.  I ride long distances on the road for training (not racing) so I don&#x27;t have need of a wheel that has low rotational inertia.  As such I could accept a weight penalty for the sake of comfort.  I own a titanium road frame which is &quot;heavy&quot; by road standards and I put a tandem fork on it for extra strength, and I ride 40 spoke wheels.  The idea that weight is paramount bar none might be true for professional cyclists but not for everyone.  To a great many people it&#x27;s only a small factor when making decisions.<p>EDIT: formatting and moving the link",1399325075

The characteristics are length of arm, prognathism, a heavy massive cranium with large zygomatic arches, flat nose depressed at base, &c. But in one important respect, the character of the hair, the white man stands in closer relation to the higher apes than does the Negro.</i><p><i>Mentally the negro is inferior to the white. The remark of F. Manetta, made after a long study of the negro in America, may be taken as generally true of the whole race: &quot; the negro children were sharp, intelligent and full of vivacity, but on approaching the adult period a gradual change set in. The intellect seemed to become clouded, animation giving place to a sort of lethargy, briskness yielding to indolence. We must necessarily suppose that the development of the negro and white proceeds on different lines. While with the latter the volume of the brain grows with the expansion of the brainpan, in the former the growth of the brain is on the contrary arrested by the premature closing of the cranial sutures and lateral pressure of the frontal bone. 3 This explanation is reasonable and even probable as a contributing cause; but evidence is lacking on the subject and the arrest or even deterioration in mental develop- ment is no doubt very largely due to the fact that after puberty sexual matters take the first place in the negro&#x27;s life and thoughts. At the same time his environment has not been su:h as would tend to produce in him the restless energy which has led to the progress of the white race; and the easy conditions of tropical life and the fertility of the soil have reduced the struggle for existence to a minimum. But though the mental inferiority of the negro to [the white or yellow races is a fact, it has often been exaggerated; the negro is largely the creature of his environment, and it is not fair to judge of his mental capacity by tests taken directly from the environment of the white man, as for instance tests in mental arithmetic; skill in reckoning is necessary to the white race, and it has cultivated this faculty; but it is not necessary to the negro.</i><p><i>On the other hand negroes far surpass white men in acuteness of vision, hearing, sense of direction and topography. A native who has once visited a particular locality will rarely fail to recognize it again. For the rest, the mental constitution of the negro is very similar to that of a child, normally good-natured and cheerful, but subject to sudden fits of emotion and passion during which he is capable of performing acts of singular atrocity, impressionable, vain, but often exhibiting in the capacity of servant a dog-like fidelity which has stood the supreme test. Given suitable training, the negro is capable of becoming a craftsman of considerable skill, particularly in metal work, carpentry and carving. The bronze castings by the cire perdue process, and the cups and horns of ivory elaborately carved, which were produced by the natives of Guinea after their intercourse with the Portuguese of the i6th century, bear ample witness to this. But the rapid decline and practical evanescence of both industries, when that intercourse was interrupted, shows that the native craftsman was raised for the moment >above his normal level by direct foreign inspiration, and was unable to sustain the high quality of his work when that inspiration failed.</i><p>-- Encyclopedia Britannica 11th Edition<p>Hurt feelings are hardly the worst byproduct of Encyclopedia policies in regard to editorials and authorship.<p><a href=""https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri19chisrich/encyclopaediabri19chisrich_djvu.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri19chisrich/encycl...</a>",1399324515

Once you start using public money to build infrastructure, politics determines the level of spending rather than actual demand.<p>The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that we have $3.6 trillion in delayed maintenance and underinvestment of our core infrastructure (water, sewers, bridges, power lines, etc): <a href=""https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2013/04/08/infr-a08.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2013/04/08/infr-a08.html</a>.<p>I&#x27;m not one of those people that believes we shouldn&#x27;t have public infrastructure, but I do think you have to be cognizant of the trade-offs involved. Take something like Amtrak. Amtrak has an almost $9 billion maintenance backlog on the Northeast Corridor: <a href=""http://usa.streetsblog.org/2011/06/15/house-plan-to-privatize-northeast-corridor-more-moderate-than-expected"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usa.streetsblog.org/2011/06/15/house-plan-to-privatiz...</a>. The NEC is the only part of the whole system that generates an operating profit. A private company would shut down the rest of the network, and try to make the NEC service as attractive as possible for customers. But in a regime where politics decides where the money goes, the operating surplus generated by the NEC instead goes to funding money-losing lines in the rest of the country.<p>Road building, too, is the result of distorted incentives. As an urbanite who doesn&#x27;t like to drive, I would spend $0 on highways designed to get suburban commuters into the cities, and spend that money on public transit instead. Surbanites, of course, feel differently. Who decides how that money is allocated? Not the market, but the political system, which at the national level systematically over represents rural and suburban votes.<p>The situation with telecom companies isn&#x27;t ideal, but I don&#x27;t think the dynamics of the telecom market are amenable to the kind of broad political consensus necessary for a successful municipal service. Take water, for example. Everybody needs roughly the same amount of water, and is satisfied with a relatively similar level of water quality. Meanwhile, I&#x27;d bet 95% of people would be perfectly happy with 5 mbps service, while a small minority wants gigabit. Do you think the political system is set up to make that small minority happy? If there is anything to learn from how municipalities handle public infrastructure is that when you put it to a vote, the voters will spend as little as possible to get the minimum acceptable level of service. That&#x27;s exactly what happened to our power and water infrastructure.",1399323860

7701238,comment,7700312,7700312,1,0,yaur,,,"The first issue he brings up seems legit.  Whter it is exploitable or not depends heavily on if an unprivileged account can trigger a read to /dev/urandom to abort early by triggering an interrupt.  I don&#x27;t know Linux internals well enough to know if this is the case, but since this is documented behavior it seems reasonable to concede that there could be some platform where its true.<p>Everything else seems specious.  If you are in an environment controlled by an attacker there is no case where you can reliably generate random numbers.  Sure as an attacker that already has root access I could replace /dev/urandom with a link to /dev/zero, but why would I do that when I could just install a kernel module that silently sent me whatever real random seed I decided to give you or patch your process to send the keys that are the end product of that randomness to my self?",1399323840

Although I have a reasonable idea what it would take technically, I don&#x27;t actually know the financial impact to Comcast for increasing capacity to L3 or Cogent (not even ballpark).  However, I&#x27;m  taking the L3 article at face value when it says:<p><pre><code>    But there are also typically shared costs for networks to \n    interconnect. Each party pays to augment its own network \n    to allow for more traffic exchange (the expense to augment \n    capacity is not significant for either party). And since \n    we often choose to interconnect in a third party data \n    center, the networks usually agree to share the cost of \n    the cross connects by paying for them on an alternating \n    basis.\n</code></pre>\nI take that to mean the CapEx is insignificant and the recurring expenses are shared equitably.  What&#x27;s notable about that is that Comcast isn&#x27;t even sitting down at the table to negotiate equitable terms for upgraded capacity.

Rabl is horribly slow in template generation...<p>Also, FWIW-- older versions of AMS, with caching, are a total crapshoot due to marshal dumping the objects into the cache and re-serializing them to JSON each time. Much better to cache the response itself instead of the objects making up the response.<p>Granted the caching feature was yanked out of AMS, but pretty painful for those of us that actually tried using it. Carrierwave + AMS caching = Problemzilla<p>At this point, we too have had Rabl, AMS, and Representers and the best one of the lot-- by far, for our use cases has been: Roar. <a href=""https://github.com/apotonick/roar-rails"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/apotonick/roar-rails</a><p>Plus, it&#x27;s the only system which will de-serialize the data using the representer.

I&#x27;ve always had the impression it&#x27;s more about performing and the size of the audience - more about votes and reactions than expected interactions.<p>No matter how nasty or inane your opinions are, you can share them on a related YouTube video and receive anonymous validation from other people who agree with you. When you&#x27;re feeling bad about yourself and want to lash out, you can post something vile and get a response.<p>I believe this was a source of a lot of complaints about changes to the comment system. It hurt ones ability to receive instant gratification by dropping a comment on the top of the stack.<p>In the bat analogy, upvotes/karma are a sort of secondary &#x27;junk food&#x27; blood supply that costs the giver nothing and some bats don&#x27;t care for it as they prefer real sustenance but others are addicted to it.

Instead look for a company that makes a product which you find meaningful. Once you do, you&#x27;ll likely be able to find creative avenues regardless of the company&#x27;s size. You just have to go about it the right way:<p>First, you&#x27;ll want to become a expert in your company&#x27;s product domain. This will make your creative flashes much more relevant, and therefore more likely to see the light of day.<p>Second, start small. Use your own time to create a new tool which you know your team will find useful, and use the opportunity to teach yourself something new while you&#x27;re at it. After a few successive wins you&#x27;ll be allowed more and more leeway to apply your creative energies during company time, and the impact of your successes will grow.<p>Third, don&#x27;t ask your manager for permission to work on Side Project X, at least not until you have somewhat of a reputation for delivering useful innovations. It truly is easier to beg for forgiveness than to ask for permission.<p>Lastly, give your colleagues a sense of ownership.

In the workshop over the bench hung a sign that read &quot;if you&#x27;ve got nothing to do, don&#x27;t do it here&quot;. It was rude but quite effective. The next level up (for those that didn&#x27;t get the hint) was that the guy running the shop would pretend to &#x27;oil the spokes&#x27; (as if that was ever needed) causing several people to hastily depart the workshop area because they were being splashed with lube oil. He would pretend to see a lot less well and shake a lot more than he usually did during these episodes. Super nice guy by the way, long since deceased.<p>One problem with internet websites is that it is not clearly separated into work or leisure, which leads to people in leisure mode disrupting other people&#x27;s work mode.<p>This is not an easy problem to solve and I&#x27;m sure that this is not a binary issue either, but some form of continuum.",1400878355

Microsoft has demonstrated with the Surface line an institutional inability to execute. From Surface RT shipping with a buggy beta of Office to continuing major deficiencies in Windows Phone (no forward button in IE until 8.1?) to the schizo nature of Windows 8 that only makes sense if you look from the engineering side and realize that its schizo only because it would be too hard to make everything run in Metro. Yes, there are engineering compromises that have to be made, but they shouldn&#x27;t result in what the user perceives to be a compromised product.<p>Sometimes its better to not do something unless you can do it right. E.g. Surface RT shouldn&#x27;t have shipped without a final version of Office. It featured prominently in every rewview, and almost nobody went back and updated theirs. E.g. Surface Pro shouldn&#x27;t have shipped without Haswell. E.g. Surface Pro 2 shouldn&#x27;t have shipped without the major firmware update that improved battery life by 20%. E.g. Apple has wisely avoided shipping a Retina MBA because they can&#x27;t do it yet without regressing battery life.<p>Microsoft is playing in Apple&#x27;s price range, and is late to the game. What it lacks is Apple&#x27;s ability to take on limited ambitious, but (usually) execute those without major flaws.",1400878337

With a lot more work (more than a single blogger probably has time for), it might be shown to be much worse. For example, Piketty chose the U.K., France and Sweden for his list of European countries (averaging them all into &quot;Europe&quot; without adjusting for their populations, as the article pointed out). But why those particular countries? Would the results have been completely different if he would have also included Germany, one of the wealthiest and most populous European countries? We&#x27;ll probably never know how he came up with his set of countries, and whether he deliberately omitted other countries whose data was available because they would have caused his results to be not significant enough to publish (or even contradicted his thesis).<p>This reminded me a lot of one of the original studies linking cholesterol to heart disease, which chose a carefully picked subset of European countries even though results were available for several others.

Most often this fact is unappreciated because most of the artistry of software is invisible except to the people working closely on it. Also, when looking from afar or when looking close up for only a moment the work looks mostly technical and mechanical. But people ignore that the same is true of artistic works, because we can see the outcomes more clearly so we avoid being misled.<p>Many times I&#x27;ve seen developers getting burned out because their management treated them like factory workers or, worse, cattle. Often what happens is that some of the better devs start leaving and then that creates a cascade where the working environment just gets worse and worse for everyone else (fewer good people to do the work so more work and more stress for everyone else, and fewer coworkers you enjoy working with) and more and more good people leave.<p>What you say is totally true about working on projects you care about. That&#x27;s always the way it will be with artists. If you want to work on something that you don&#x27;t care about, you can, but you won&#x27;t be able to do so at your full capacity. You&#x27;ll need to disengage with it enough to keep it at arm&#x27;s distance, to disinvest much of your self from it. That too can be perilous because it risks becoming disinvested from development as a whole and losing your passion entirely.",1400877844

7791131,comment,7783556,7783556,3,0,reuven,,,"Hey, just noticed this thread!<p>There is a lot to say, and I&quot;m not sure where to begin.  But I was (as I wrote in my original story) one of the editors of the MIT student newspaper.  We had a lot of fun, and some great computers.  And every so often, someone would come by and ask to search through our archives.<p>Now, our &quot;great computers&quot; were Atex systems for typesetting and layout, based (I think) on PDPs of some sort.  So to search through the archives meant loading a &quot;disk pack,&quot; which is a laughably large hard disk that you had to put into the machine or take off of it.  Just searching through the 100+ years of the newspaper&#x27;s archives was a huge task.<p>At some point, we figured out how to get the information from Atex onto a more modern computer.  And I set up the index, for my undergrad thesis, to be accessible on the Internet (not the Web).  But the interface was clunky, and while it was better than before, the search was far from perfect.<p>So it was really great timing when Jeremy Hylton (now of Python/Google) went to that talk.  We turned off my thesis software, turned on a Web site, and set up a simple search to work on our Web site.  The thing is, while this was a great feature, there was one missing component -- users.  So we actually took out large &quot;house ads&quot; (i.e., advertisements that the newspaper takes out itself, rather than selling to advertisers) telling people how to get a browser, what a URL was, how to enter the URL into a browser... all so that they could search the newspaper archives.<p>This was in early 1993, and I was still living in Boston at the time.  A few months later, I went to a computer show, in which someone was showing off Web authoring tools.  He asked who had a Web site, and I was the only one to raise my hand.  I think that it just <i>started</i> at that point to become known among the technological elites, but the &quot;elite&quot; part meant that you had ever browsed the Web, not that you created sites yourself.<p>Another quick anecdote: When we set up the newspaper&#x27;s Web site, we wanted people to be able to contact us.  HTML forms had just been invented, as had the CGI protocol.  So I hacked together a little program that took the contents of a form and sent it, via e-mail, to our administrators.  I called it form-mail, and it was written in Perl, and all was great... until a few years later, when someone named &quot;Matt&quot; took it, removed my name, added his, took out all of the security features I had put in, and then made it famous as part of &quot;Matt&#x27;s Script Archive,&quot; which was the bane of Perl programmers&#x27; existence for years.<p>I seem to have lost the e-mail exchange that I had with him at the time, but when I told him that you cannot just remove someone else&#x27;s name from GPL&#x27;ed code, he claimed to be scared, and then never did anything about it.  Which is just as well, given that he so sullied the name of my program that I&#x27;m happy to give him the credit for all subsequent versions.<p>One last point: There wasn&#x27;t any CGI.pm, or other Perl module to do Web stuff, back then.  So I wrote my own code to decode data from POST-submitted forms.  If you ever see the Perl code &quot;for $pair in @pairs&quot;, then it&#x27;s almost certainly copied from the code that I wrote in that first form-mail program, oh-so-many years ago.<p>Fun stuff, indeed!",1400876620

Expectations change, fast, as you age. I keep getting asked about my foolish/unstable years, even a decade+ after.<p>It is expected of a young professional to hop around a bit... it could be argued that you cannot truly mature until you have seen a couple of different versions of &quot;this is the way things get done around here&quot; meme. But if you overdo it, your perceived value will take a hit and it will take some work to overcome the &quot;unwillingness to commit&quot; perception.<p>One thing I have observed in this industry is that nobody gets any sound information on how to recruit people; specially how to find and bring in people whose unique strengths will benefit the most to the current team. Under this circumstances, most programmers default to look &quot;people like me, only more so&quot; which tend to form teams with a sort of hive mind.<p>The relevance to job hopping is that by doing so, you are ruling yourself out of any job whose hiring manager and/or teach lead have had bad experiences with it. Since you do not know what kind of person you will turn out to be by age 40, or what the job market is going to be like at any point during your multi-decade career, it makes sense to not burn any bridges if this can be avoided.<p>I would not go as far as to say that you should suck it up and keep a job that is making you hate yourself or your art. I had one of those once and barely lasted 4 months there.

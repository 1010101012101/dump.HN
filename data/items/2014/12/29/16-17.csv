8810561,comment,8810058,8810058,0,0,amenonsen,,,"As someone who didn&#x27;t really know what they were doing, I used NaCl recently to write a program to tunnel packets over UDP.<p>I started by reading the NaCl source and all the introductory material available—the web site, the two NaCl papers (&quot;Cryptography in NaCl&quot;, &quot;The security impact of a new cryptography library&quot;), and quickly reviewed a couple of other papers (e.g. to understand deterministic encryption and D-H key exchange). I think the biggest problem I had was to understand nonce generation and handling properly. The &quot;Cryptography …&quot; paper does contain some advice that I ultimately implemented. But I had to think very hard about what it said before I was confident that I was doing what it said. For example, it says:<p>«…the nonce can be chosen as a simple counter: 0 for Alice’s first packet, 1 for Bob’s first packet, 2 for Alice’s second packet, 3 for Bob’s second packet, 4 for Alice’s third packet, 5 for Bob’s third packet, etc. Choosing the nonce as a counter followed by (e.g.) 32 random bits helps protect some protocols against denial-of-service attacks. In many applications it is better to increase the counter to, e.g., the number of nanoseconds that have passed since a standard epoch in the local clock, so that the current value of the counter does not leak the \ntraffic rate.»<p>I managed to figure it out, but I would certainly have welcomed a more detailed explanation, and would have been very happy to have help from the code to do the right thing.<p>In contrast, the cryptography functions were easy enough to figure out and use (with the C API). The only mistake I kept making was specifying the secret key first and the public key second in all my function calls. Once I got used to doing it the other way around, it was fine. Zero-padding the messages was slightly ugly, but I didn&#x27;t develop any especially strong feelings about it. (Aside: I actually ended up using TweetNaCl, but of course all the documentation is the same.)<p>I&#x27;m very pleased with the resulting code, anyway.<p>P.S. I looked at libsodium, but greatly preferred the unadorned library.",1419872216

In the 1980s, distribution of cracked titles was mostly by modem (BBS) or warez disks, and thus a LOT slower than today. Cracks would take weeks or months to get wide distribution.<p>3. Atari was paying me $30K/year. Let&#x27;s double that for total employee load. It took me two weeks to write the copy protection, so that&#x27;s roughly $2500 cost to Atari.<p>4. I think Atari&#x27;s profit on carts was about $25. So to break even we had to deter 100 people from pirating the game and just buy it instead. You can wiggle the profit numbers around if you like, but it doesn&#x27;t change them appreciably -- it&#x27;s just not that many buyers that we have to swing in order to pay for development.<p>It&#x27;s impossible to get numbers, but the fact that the game wasn&#x27;t trivially copyable by the kid down the street (it took an expert cracker 3 days), that cracks were hard to obtain (little inter-pirate communication, bad distribution systems), and that the title sold maybe a million copies makes it almost certain that the protection not only paid for itself, but did so many times over.",1419872156

And all things being equal, .45 is a lot bigger than .357.<p>However I note that that famous .357 load has a nominal velocity that&#x27;s twice as high as .45 ACP, so <i>maybe</i> it really is disproportionately effective (note that only the 10mm has really duplicated or rather substantially exceeded its ballistics, even .357 SIG doesn&#x27;t quite reach the .357 Magnum).<p>One thing that got me to wondering in this direction is the &quot;unreasonable effectiveness&quot; of ~.30 caliber ball (FMJ) ammo (e.g. including the .303, German 7×57mm and Russian 7.62×54mmR).  Absent construction like the relatively fragile West German 7.62 NATO round, like e.g. AK-47 rounds it&#x27;s going flip, at least partly, before exiting without fragmentation, and without dumping much of its energy unless it hits solid bone or the like.<p>Fackler&#x27;s general thesis about wounding is that permanent crush cavity counts, &quot;hydrostatic shock&quot; and the like don&#x27;t much or at all, soft tissue by and large gets pushed out of the way and snaps back.  Note that he got his start in this in Vietnam field surgery....<p>But when I look at the temporary effects of a high power 7.62 or thereabouts slug, I note that in most any torso hit their radius is going to encompass the spine.  So I&#x27;ve been wondering if their proven effectiveness on the battlefield is a combination of a potentially temporary shock effect on the CNS via the spine (plus of course the direct effects), followed by bleeding out etc. before sufficient medical care can be rendered.

For example, it is not unreasonable to say that Putin lost the presidential elections in many regions (recall news stories where they showed 150% of the vote).

It&#x27;s more for nationalistic reasons than for values reasons.) But to say that, therefore, people in China want more oppression... is a bit of a stretch. They just see the open internet as a tool of Western oppression, and they say, &quot;Good. The government is protecting me from it.&quot;<p>Now on other issues, Chinese are also demanding to be protected. From things like corruption. However, because of the way things work in China... this desire to be protected from corruption, at times, actually ends up strengthening the central government as well. This is because the people who are normally... say... appropriating land illegally... are local officials. The local people, on the other hand, know that if they protest long enough, and loud enough, that Beijing will come. At which point things will go in a decidedly bad fashion for the local bosses. So Beijing comes off as their &#x27;savior&#x27; in a lot of these cases as well.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is that, I really think Chinese are looking at the problems they have from a different perspective than you do. From their perspective... Beijing is a help with a lot of their issues... not a hindrance or the cause. From their perspective, oppression hasn&#x27;t &#x27;doubled down&#x27;, Beijing is ALLEVIATING a lot of oppression.

When you call your bank and say that some charges on your card were unauthorized, and they give you back that money, it immediately comes out of the bank accounts of the stores that made the charges. They are paying for the reversals, not the card issuer. Each of those stores also pays a significant chargeback fee, which more than covers the cost of that customer support agent that took the call, and reissuing the physical card if necessary. Plus, much of the transaction fee goes to paying out rewards to card holders and to the processing networks that make everything work (e.g. VisaNet), rather than to the banks&#x27; profits. That reflects the fact that the banks generally don&#x27;t have significant fraud losses to cover. The cost to banks from reissuing cards after massive data breaches at major retailers is a relatively new phenomenon and isn&#x27;t priced into those fees.",1419871787

This is on Firefox nightly in Linux.<p>Also, the skills sections with stars causes the remove (x) icon to reflow the skills section, causing an unsightly jump in the skills. A solution could be to absolutely position the remove button so that it doesn&#x27;t cause that jump.<p>Further, the subhead below the name appears to not have enough vertical whitespace separating the two -- this occurs in both the HTML representation and the PDF.<p>&quot;whether&quot; is spelled incorrectly as &quot;wether&quot;.<p>While the page also seems pretty &quot;responsive&quot; the edit and export tools look awkward at points in between the standard mobile sizes and when it makes the jump to the desktop experience -- specifically, the widths of those panels do not match the width of the résumé preview. There also doesn&#x27;t appear to be any whitespace between the résumé and further panels.<p>The contact section also looks awkward in the mobile view -- the icons appear to escape the left margin of the rest of the résumé, and there isn&#x27;t any whitespace between the name and subhead.<p>In addition, the capitalization for the editing/export tools is inconsistent -- &quot;Export controls&quot; vs. &quot;Edit Tools&quot;, and may be too verbose as labels.<p>The &quot;ease in&quot; effect for the &quot;Beautiful resumes done in seconds!&quot; seems superfluous to me.<p>Lastly, the sidebar could probably just stay fixed as the user scrolls through the page, so that it is always available, especially for longer documents.<p>Wishlist item for me would be an import/export in the native data format for this tool -- plaintext as Markdown (or whatever you are using internally) would be handy, as copying information out of an exported PDF can be challenging.",1419871590

It is likely that some people in China used the service for nefarious purposes (local official corruption is probable) and that the authorities wanted to keep opposable proof, in order be able to show to increasingly disgruntled citizenry that the rule of law can work -- as opposed to the often preferred option of social-media fuelled lynching.<p>My point is not that banning GMail is good, but that you are judging an institution without knowing their intent. They could be wrong, but not for the reason that you do not give them.<p>I certainly agree on the balkanisation, though. Ebbs and flows, I hope.<p>As for your more general point: Western values are great in Western countries; Western inequality in a country with red envelopes and little over-sight of officials is less ideal. Western alcohol is fun in a fancy restaurant with a French ceremonial Maitre d´ that frowns on excess; it is less ideal in a country without a tradition for moderation. The subsequent lash out can be amusing where a hen party ends trying to act sober and cute in front of a jaded cop; it is far less so to see your touchy-feely employer come home drunk in a country where domestic employment is akin to servitude. I&#x27;m obviously exaggerating, but Westernisation (and simultaneous but unrelated issues, like working class disempowerment) has left many people wondering, and they found reasons to doubt.<p>If you are a traveller who mainly faces empowered businessmen , it is difficult to conceive good examples of this -- but many stories would make you pause. Vice.com (has a very criticisable editorial line, but) offers a unique look in many such examples: I remember a couple about plastic surgery that were very telling (and unexpected for people more used to judging people´s coding style on a screen than their physique on a dance floor), one in Korea the other in the Caribbean. International style magazine has lead Koreans to go under the knife and unreasonable amount of time to look more Westerners: nothing to do with SMTP in theory, but enough to let family members amalgamate Yahoo! editorial choices and their shame over a daughter´s botched operation.

It is sad for Westerners living in an Emirate when that only bar where you can kiss in public without being scorned gets closed for `indecency´ but I suspect there are more nefarious things that have happened there than diplomats remembering their honeymoon in Paris.

However, back in 2009, Yahoo started serving Bing search results exclusively instead of maintaining its crawling and ranking systems, simply adding advertisements via its ad networks to the results. [2]<p>I&#x27;m most interested in how this plays out considering reports that Google used to pay around $300 mil/year to Mozilla to be the default search service--it must be a lucrative source of leads. [3] I wonder how the event would have been advertised if Firefox defaulted to serving Microsoft&#x27;s Bing results? This is big business and, with the joining of Bing and Yahoo, Google may have a challenger (eventually), albeit as competition wanes--68% market share for Google, 29% Bing+Yahoo as of early 2014. [4]<p>Does it matter that nearly approximately 50% of average users (those that don&#x27;t know they can change their default search engine) will get almost all content served to them as Microsoft sees fit? (A lot of guesstimation, but market share of IE+Firefox+Safari was approximately 49% Nov 2014 according to StatCounter) [5]<p>What opportunities are there for search engine companies to now highly editorialize/&quot;curate&quot; their results--i.e., pay for submission only, first 20 pages paid listings only, censorship of competitor products, skewing placement for news coverage from certain sources, etc? Seems that there are many interesting opportunities for search engines to monetize their services beyond a few keyword relevant adds on the top and right.",1419871217

More than 125 Tibetans have set themselves on fire since March 2011[1], including three in the past week [2] (37-yr-old monk, 20-yr-old woman, and a 34-yr-old man) to protest against this repressive Chinese occupation. As a Tibetan, the past protests and these self-immolations are heart-wrenching and at the Toronto vigil this past weekend, there were people in tears. It&#x27;s just hard.<p>We live in this amazing world and yet we have all these geopolitical issues (Eastern Europe, Middle East, Tibet, Kashmir, etc.) caused by various factors we vehemently believe/oppose (we humans have an brilliant capacity to rationalize any of our actions/beliefs). This past summer, I traveled across Kashmir with my two high school friends to visit the areas where the Indo-Pakistani[3] and Sino-Indian[4] wars took place. The landscape was beautiful, especially in the Ladakh regions. But overall, these regions are occupied by villages and small towns dwarfed by the huge military bases. Why can&#x27;t these local people live by themselves without the fear of another war? Most of you already know, it&#x27;s the same textbook example: a new ruler comes in town, finds the need to distract/rally his or her country - what better than a war (this &quot;war&quot; could be extended to politics/tech/biz, not just the old Roman wars)? History is littered with the similar plots and it works every single time.<p>Sometimes, I wonder if an ET contact would be good for our world so we could put down our differences and realize we are all in this together so we could take care of each other, our neighbors, and our amazing planet! Also, solving Fermi&#x27;s paradox [5] would be icing on the cake!<p>[1]<a href=""http://freetibet.org/news-media/na/full-list-self-immolations-tibet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freetibet.org/news-media/na/full-list-self-immolation...</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/12/26/uk-china-tibet-idUKKBN0K404V20141226"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/12/26/uk-china-tibet-idUK...</a>\n[3]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_wars_and_conflicts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_wars_and_confli...</a>\n[4]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_War"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_War</a>\n[5]<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8796270"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8796270</a>",1419871192

An unexpected number of casualties under an ambiguous mission sort of undermined Regan&#x27;s criticism Jimmy Carter for <i>Eagle Claw</i> [8 dead trying to rescue the hostages in Iran] during the 1980 election cycle. [1] Politically, 1983 was a campaign year for the 1984 presidential election.<p>On the other hand, the big shift has been in military doctrine from valuing equipment and expending personnel to valuing personnel and expending equipment. And that has come about as the military has increasingly emphasized training. Gone are the green divisions that suffered heavily in the Ardennes in the winter of 1944-45. US military doctrine does not view soldiers as warm bodies so much since the suspension of conscription in the 1970&#x27;s.<p>In my opinion, public opinion has followed doctrine, not the other way around. Not that the public ever thought that US soldiers dying was good, but rather that they never saw <i>Blackhawk Down</i> type casualties as tragic until the government raised it from the level of an unfortunate cost of war.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw</a>",1419871141

Often it requires me searching the mailing list or Stack Overflow to figure out &quot;idiomatic&quot; Julia code when this really should be in the documentation (who knew that a matrix operation A += B allocates new memory for A each time?)  And I think global variables should just be removed altogether, as many problems as they cause.  I commonly find myself thinking &quot;There&#x27;s no way that someone new to Julia would know you&#x27;re supposed to do it this way&quot;, whereas with Python or even C, that&#x27;s not the case.<p>But I think the language has a lot of promise, and the language <i>design</i> is really slick and well put together: powerful macros, a nice type system, multiple dispatch, clean code when you don&#x27;t need performance but lots of additional decorations you can add when you do (devectorization, @parallel, @inbounds, @simd, type annotations).<p>Remember that Julia is only at dev version 0.4.  The author of the article complains about breaking backwards compatibility on an almost daily basis by removing or changing things.  At this early stage, I see absolutely nothing wrong with this.  I&#x27;m tired of languages that have unintuitive and quirky (stupid) ways of doing things just in order to not break existing code.  C++, for instance, is abhorrent to me.  How many pages is the standard??<p>At the moment, Julia has a steep learning curve <i>if</i> you want high-performance code.  But once you know what you&#x27;re doing, it&#x27;s easy to get it running at the level of C.  Plus, features like viewing the AST, or the LLVM and native assembly representation of the code are handy for debugging.",1419870661

Some scholars claim that the USA committed the first act of war well before the CSA opened fire on Ft. Sumter.<p>Obfuscating the adversarial acts that occurred before battle is joined is a choice made by historians.  I recall my history teachers teaching about the Stamp Act and the Intolerable Acts prior to Lexington and Concord, but somehow Fort Sumter started the Civil War?  That situation would be a lot like petitioning for divorce, getting the house in the settlement, and coming home that night to find that your ex-spouse was still living in the garden shed.<p>But I think it is safe to say that there were plenty of jerkfaces on both sides of the conflict, and they got a lot of good people killed, along with the bad.  I can&#x27;t say for certain what would have avoided the bloodshed, if anything, because we cannot A/B test history.  I believe that war then was substantially similar to war now; it is usually a handful of people who stand to benefit, maneuvering other people into a false choice between losing and losing more.  By the time the actual shooting starts, the bets have already been placed, and all that remains is to wait for the dice to stop rolling.<p>It&#x27;s nice that slavery was abolished in the whole USA in the aftermath of the war, but on the whole, the UK way of doing it was much better.  If the worst aftereffect they are feeling now is some outstanding 4% consols, that&#x27;s hardly worrisome at all, compared to the lingering legacies of abolition in the US.",1419870425

Raft requires that a majority of the cluster be able to communicate in order to make forward progress. In the event that a majority can&#x27;t communicate, no changes to the cluster can be made. This isn&#x27;t particularly unique to Raft; any distributed consensus algorithm that wishes to maintain consistency has this: if your cluster is split in such a way that a majority can&#x27;t communicate, you can&#x27;t both accept writes and prevent the cluster from becoming &quot;split-brained&quot;, i.e., having two states, one on each side of the split. If a majority of nodes can communicate, you know that your side of the split is unique in this regard, and can thus keep going. All other splits, not having a majority, will not be able to accept writes.<p>A note about majorities: The definition of majority is &quot;_More than half_ (50%) of some group&quot;; in a cluster of size 5, this is at least 3. In a cluster of size 6, this is at least _4_. Because it is more than half (and not just half), even sized clusters are just fine in Raft: in a 3/3 split in a size 6 cluster, neither side has majority by definition.",1419870274

Usually, there is some syntactic sugar for that.<p>In short, inheritance is a set of rules, and these rules could be implemented using various mechanism, like explicit message-passing (a-la Erlang) or implicitly, using procedures calls.<p>Brian Harvey in classic Berkeley CS61A explained these ideas much better than me.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u3pp7JCAIU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u3pp7JCAIU</a>",1419869955

Back in WWII, if a German soldier took at .30-06 in the chest from an M1, he wasn&#x27;t getting up from it. Even the British Enfield and Vickers guns using the venerable old .303 (7mm) would put a man down reliably with a solid hit.<p>I personally know troops who have shot insurgents several times with M4s at lethal ranges (less than 200&#x27;) and they took the hits and kept fighting long enough to return fire. Those same insurgents hit with a 7.62 slug would be DRT. Full stop. There is a reason quite a few Marines and soldiers carried .357 revolvers in Vietnam. The reason was the stopping power. The 125 grain .357 traveling at 1400 FPS boasts 96% one shot stops on human torsos that are not armoured. The .357 is still the gold standard for handgun stopping power. Like you with your 1911, I&#x27;m a .357 guy. If I cannot do it with six, I need something belt fed. Plus, like a lot of guys I know, I favour a New York reload anyway.<p>Stay safe.",1419869873

8810279,comment,8808152,8808152,0,0,zak_mc_kracken,,,"Some of the most painful games I&#x27;ve had to crack were those that used obfuscated assembly (usually by xor&#x27;ing entire sections of code). This had the annoying effect of making it impossible to put breakpoints too far ahead of the code because assembly debuggers put breakpoints by modifying the opcodes (usually calling an interrupt) so by the time the unrolling routine comes along, it will decode the wrong bytes and you&#x27;ll get garbage (and usually, a nice lock up or reboot).<p>The only way around that was to painfully go stage by stage, which was very time consuming.",1419868897

8810264,comment,8809084,8809902,0,0,abathologist,,,"I&#x27;m not an expert or professional, but I&#x27;ll offer some few cents here.<p>I think your feeling that the &quot;goalposts have moved&quot; is a result of mistaking &#x27;Functional Programing&#x27; as the name for a set of language features. Instead, I understand FP to designate a far reaching paradigm encompassing language design, computer science research, and the design and development of particular programs.<p>As I understand it, the initial motive for FP was the development of an elegant, mathematically grounded programming style in which the human readable forms of expression neatly reflect the underlying computational model. This is evident in John McCarthy&#x27;s 1962 &quot;A basis for a mathematical theory of computation&quot;[0], where he presents<p>> a formalism based on conditionals forms and recursive functions whereby the functions computable in terms of certain base functions can be simply expressed.<p>The same principles seem to persist right through to the current wikipedia article on FP:<p>> In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.<p>Of course, over the course of 50+ years of ongoing research into FP, and roughly 80 years of research into the functional expression of mathematical foundations, there have been lots of developments and plenty of emergent insights that have altered the reigning implementations of FP languages. The fact that OO languages can keep incorporating features that emerge in FP languages is simply a testament to the fertility of the paradigm.<p>The advent of type-theoretic constructs (like higher-kinded-types) in FP is directly related to the central motives and inspirations of FP. It continues to draw inspiration from developments in maths. Contemporary FP incorporating ideas from type-theory is just like LISP incorporating ideas form the lambda calculus. Since both FP is an ongoing research and design paradigm, the features and approaches associated with it continue to develop. And unless the implementation of FP languages ever overtakes the ongoing research into functional foundations of mathematics, FP will continue to incorporate findings that emerge in the latter.<p>I may be mistaken, but I don&#x27;t believe homoiconicity was ever a central feature of the FP paradigm. And, as you note, is is only associated with FP because LISPs were the paradigmatic FP language for so long. But homoiconicity is always a feature of the primordial OO and LP languages, SmallTalk and Prolog.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/6099/AIM-031.pdf?sequence=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/6099/AIM-031.p...</a>",1419868820

One of the first groups in Asia they came across were excellent accountants. The non-literate Mongolians brought them along to inventory further conquests.<p>That is remarkable.<p>They built a network of roads ( a memorable sentence from the book - paraphrase: &quot;The only structures the Mongolians knew how to build were bridges - so that they would always have a way back home&quot;<p>They had no religion that they wanted to impose. No particular ideology.<p>They came up with innovative answers to problems that included prototypes for paper currency; law between states; religious tolerance.<p>They could be brutal - but to the noble/clerical ruling classes, supposedly not so much to the peasant and trade classes. And compared to what? Life for peasants was pretty much &#x27;nasty, brutish and short&#x27; as it was. It seems possible that the Mongols could have offered them a better bargain they they were getting from King and Church. And that is why there was not sustained revolts.<p>There is an oft quoted cliche &quot;History is writ by the victors...&quot;<p>In this case not true. They were non-literate in Ghengis&#x27; generation. The history of the Mongol invasions were written by the vanquished upper classes.",1419868815

Does such a thing exist?",1240750554

Whether it's intentional or just an emergent property of its design, it's heavily skewed towards rewarding hysterical sound bites.<p>(The above characteristics are shared by SMS, of course.)",1240750342

579918,comment,579697,579746,0,0,rincewind,,,"That is exactly the point of the story. Gravity works <i>the same way</i> everywhere in this universe (this includes non-earth locations). But instead of applying common sense, the TA <i>made up</i> a fact about the Moon.<p>Maybe there is some kind of cognitive bias in the heads of some that makes them think Earth is different from the rest of the universe because we happen to live here.
But that the TA did not apply Occams Razor to this problem seems weird; since he knew Descartes' philosophy, he should not have held this aristotelian world view.<p>snarkier:<p>Why not? Most people can probably get through life just fine telling other people nonsense about how gravity works at non-earth locations.",1240748465

The twitter search was interesting because after your first query, it dynamically updates a display with how many new results would be added if you refreshed the search.  The trend for swine flu kept rapidly mounting.<p>I could see this alarming the average person especially if Twitter was to distinguish their brand as the ubiquitous ""realtime"" search.",1240748461

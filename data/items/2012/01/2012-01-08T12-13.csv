3439444,comment,3437028,3438689,3,0,dalke,,,"On your suggestion, I read through <a href=""http://www.chessvibes.com/plaatjes/rybkaevidence/RYBKA_FRUIT_Mar11.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chessvibes.com/plaatjes/rybkaevidence/RYBKA_FRUIT...</a> .<p>It makes the clear and cogent statement:<p>> <i>While a large (indeed, almost complete) match is found, it is presumably feasible to opine that the Fruit source code can be taken as a manual for chess programming (perhaps in the sense of a modern version of How Computers Play Chess), and if this paradigmatic view is accepted, then the re-use of the same evaluation components might arguably be less derelict.</i><p>That theme occurs elsewhere:<p>> <i>This Fruit/Rybka overlap would already likely meet a plagiarism standard, for instance as used in the detection of non-original work in academia and/or book publishing (note that plagiarism is generally an ethical standard and not a legal one). There is also the question of how important this item is from a chess-playing standpoint, perhaps again viewing Fruit as a manual in some sense.</i><p>The issue, which is also that mentioned in the chessboard article, is that the standard for plagiarism ""in the context of computer chess (or more generally, computer boardgames)"" is extremely sensitive. It is <i>not</i> the same standard practiced in research, programming, arts, or any other field I can think of. It's so high that it's not reasonable.<p>As Wikipedia writes, ""the notion [of plagiarism] remains problematic with nebulous boundaries."" In this PDF I read of multiple cases where the copying is not copyright infringement but one of reimplementing an algorithm. Relevant quotes are ""Rybka 1.0 Beta uses bitboards, making direct code comparison ineffective"", ""Rybka uses a look-up table of patterns, while Fruit does bit-scanning"", and ""the relative scaling for each rank-based bonus in Rybka is essentially 10-30-60-100, though in units of 256 as in Fruit.""<p>This PDF does stress that the surface differences are not the issue:<p>> <i>I might stress that the fact that Fruit 2.1 visibly computes these while Rybka 1.0 Beta just has an array is not really relevant for the discussion here. The content is of more import.</i><p>where I presume the context includes ""everything must have independent origin.""<p>The PST structures are similar, although it uses different weights in parts. Note also the scaling differences between the two code bases - the similarities are in normalized space. Hence, this is again not evidence of copyright infringement. It would not be plagiarism in the scientific research fields I work in; since ""influenced by the work of XYZ"" would suffice.<p>This PDF points out that the quad() function in Rybka uses a different scaling, rank-dependent values, and more cases than Fruit.<p>This is again not a case where ""parts of the code of Rybka were copied verbatim from Fruit"" but where the approach from Fruit was modified. The PDF author then says:<p>> <i>Not all of these terms have exactly the same meaning in Rybka 1.0 Beta, and discussing any differences would diverge from my focus on the re-use of the quad() function. Perhaps the main difference is with FreePasser, as to whether the pawns path is met by a friendly or enemy piece, which uses SEE in Fruit and attacks bitboards in Rybka, and further is split into 3 parts in Rybka.</i><p>> <i>As with the PST comparison, it seems that there is a structural similarity between Fruit and Rybka, and the question of originality therein allows multiple approaches.</i><p>I think these statements are enough to establish that there was no copyright violation for this section. Your question ""Does any of that excuse either violating the GPL"" is therefore not relevant - there does not appear to be a copyright violation.<p>Could you clarify what you mean by ""violating the GPL""? Does you refer to things like the file parsing code, which shows idiomatic similarities between Rybka and Fruit?<p>Over and over again I see that the issue is not outright copyright infringement of the chess engine nor lack of attribution, but that the definition of ""plagiarism"" as used in chess competition is extremely sensitive; sensitive enough that ""structural similarity"" even with attribution is considered excessive. It's much more stringent than any other field I can think of. As used here, it has lost its moral meaning and become more of a technical term.<p>Speaking as a complete outsider, it appears that the Rybka code base went through several iterations where it was based on ideas in different, existing programs. This is not uncommon, and is both legal and moral. My Minix example is quite relevant; it's meant to be used as a reference for understanding operating systems, which means people who use it as a reference will tend to create similar OSes. A question (rightly pointed out earlier) is, do open source chess programs serve as a similar manual?<p>The Rybka author was sloppy though. He didn't use version control until very late, and he followed too closely some of the more boring parts, like file parsing.  There may be copyright infringement, and the remedy under the GPL is to request that the author either apply the GPL to the entire program, or remove the infringing parts. That this hasn't happened (I'm only guessing that it hasn't) tells me that the copyright holders aren't concerned enough to ask for help from the SFLC or other organizations which help enforce the GPL.<p>However, the core part shows signs of creative thought and improvement, which means it was not copied verbatim from Fruit. (""Creative"" here in the legal sense related to copyright law.)<p>That's why Rybka still exists as a commercial program. But the chess competition arena has a different criteria for originality. While they use the term ""plagiarism"", they do so with a different meaning than used by nearly the rest of the world.<p>The entire point of the chessbase essay was to stress that this ""originality criterion"" is increasingly at odds with how software, including chess programs, are developed. Not only does it need to be changed, but it should have been changed years ago (""updating WCCC Rule 2 to reflect contemporary reality would be a years-overdue positive step""). At the end of that essay the author quotes:<p>> <i>A fair group of participating programmers present have expressed they want the rules to be updated. One line of thinking is that attribution plus added value should be sufficient to compete, instead of 100% originality.</i><p>You say the documents against Rybka are convincing. I have read a couple of them now, and I am convinced that Rybka is in technical violation of WCCC Rule 2. I am not convinced that it's plagiarism. For that I would want to see lack of evidence of attribution, which is hard given that there is attribution. Nor am I convinced that there's wholesale copyright violation. For that I would want to see large spans of code which are not just functionally identical but which use the same values, same implementation, and same function call order. Here too the strongest evidence shows ""structural similarity"" but definitely not copyright infringement.<p>What would it take for you to be convinced otherwise? What was not persuasive in the chessbase article?",1326026848

3439442,comment,3439277,3439277,3,0,Jach,,,"Lots of good advice from others here. The point is reiterated that you need users to be useful--but that's not exactly the case. What you need is data, more specifically information on someone nearby your User who wants to meet up.<p>So searching your local existing user-base for nearby other users is the easiest way, and if you limit yourself to that, the only way. But since you really just need other people's information, you can just steal that information. Monitor places like meetup.com, public tweets, public facebook posts, craigslist, etc. Direct your Users to the results. Possibly solicit other people on behalf of the User.

If you don't have a cushion of at least 3 months (better, 6 months, ideally a year), then you're taking a big risk.  You're living above or too close to your means.<p>Sure, there are exceptions.  Not everyone is in complete control of their situation.  But I've found that most people <i>could</i> be, if they really wanted to be.  Instead they spend money on unnecessary stuff (often including families at or below the poverty line), or feel the need to ""keep up with the Joneses"".  And sure, there's a whole psychology behind all this that makes it understandable, but the bottom line is that you're taking a <i>huge</i> risk with your financial health by behaving this way, and there will be strong consequences if you lose your job.<p>I'm absolutely not in favor of stronger protections.  I want to be able to -- by default -- quit on the spot.  I've never done it, and hope I never have to, but I want the option, as the default.  If a company wants to fire me for reasons relating to my competency, then bad on me.  If I'm not creating enough value for the company, because they want or need to go in a different business direction, then I don't want to be part of that organization, fulfilling a useless role.  (And also bad on me for not getting myself into a position where I'm creating enough value.)  If a company wants to fire me for a political or discriminatory reason, then I really don't want to work for them anyway.  Life's too short for that crap.  (Not saying that we shouldn't have protected classes and try to police discrimination, though.)<p>Admittedly, I'm at the ""high end"" as far as the workforce goes, as I'm sure many others here on HN are.  My skills are in high demand, I'm good at what I do, and I'm able to live happily well below my means.  So it's likely true that I don't ""know how the other half lives"".  And frankly, I don't <i>want</i> first-hand experience.  I want to keep my skills sharp and make myself valuable whenever and wherever I can.

I'm not going to ever get around to this one, so feel free to take it if it would enhance your app.<p>The idea was to provide an app that would schedule people to meet up over coffee or lunch, but with the purpose of having an interesting debate or discussion, so the app would offer a list of debate topics and you could say which side you were interested in taking, and it would match you up with someone who wanted the other side.<p>Topics could include things like: Republican_X vs. Republican_Y, Republican_X vs. Obama, vim vs. emacs, pro-life vs. pro-choice, Edward vs. Jacob, Newton vs. Leibniz, Python vs. Ruby, Protestant vs. Catholic, Should Marijuana be Legalized?, Legalize Gay Marriage or not?, controversial state or local ballot issues and initiatives, and so on.",1326024229

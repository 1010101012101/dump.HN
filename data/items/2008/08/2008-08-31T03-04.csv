It's nothing to be embarrassed about or something that you want to try and correct.<p>Also, what pray tell is a ""real"" lisp?

We thought the students there were pretty weird (they were easily identifiable by their lack of uniforms) but of course their weirdness was more likely due to their parents than due to the school.<p>I have particularly vivid memories of the fat boy who wore skirts.<p>In later life I never actually met anyone who went to that school, though, so I couldn't tell you how they turned out. Whatever they did, they did it in very different social circles to mine.",1220154220

I've worked with ex-Microsofties, and I know what you're talking about, but I disagree with the idea that a BigCo job hurts your chances of starting something when the time is right.",1220153834

Don't believe me?  Come to Seattle sometime and watch how fast all of the Ex-Microsoft entrepreneurs hire ""program managers"" and VPs.  Working in a small startup can teach you a lot about what works (and what doesn't) on a small team with limited resources.<p>Third, it gets you into the game.  You meet other folks who like startups who can be useful later (from co-founders to future hires to investors).",1220152621

If you are speaking on the last day, or after a social event, market your talk beforehand or you'll have a smaller audience.<p>Have a bottle of water on stage with you, not soda or coffee. If your talk lasts more than 20 minutes, believe me, you'll need a sip now and then. Taking a short break to drink is OK, you can use the silence to highlight the point you just made.<p>Speaking of silence, don't feel the need to talk all the time, use silences and pauses, it adds rhythm to your presentation. Don't forget you are the expert, the audience is not, they might need some time to digest the information you are giving.<p>As an expert, you might want to shove everything you know in your talk. Don't do that, ignore the smaller details and focus on the story. No one care about the small optimization you have spent a month tweaking (unless this is the topic of your talk).

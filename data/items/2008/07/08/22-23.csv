240479,comment,239881,240351,0,0,hassy,,,"> itostr takes time to mentally process (or pronounce), if I had to read your code. integer_to_string takes no effort and can't be confused.<p>The idea is that the first time you saw `itostr` you'd do something like this:<p>* Jump to the definition of `itostr` (a couple of keypresses in Emacs).<p>* Read the Edoc comment for the function (""Convert integer to string"").<p>* Jump back to where you were (one key combo).<p>Sure, if the function was named `integer_to_string` you wouldn't have to do the above. But this was a trivial example. Many functions would take more than three words to describe what they are doing precisely, <i>especially</i> when your functions are granular and do exactly one thing. This can quickly lead to long lines, which I find hard to read and ugly.<p>At the end of the day, it's all down to personal preferences and style. I like things this way, and you like them the other. It's just the way it is, and there are arguments for both approaches. For me, the benefits of terse naming outweigh its disadvantages, and the advantages of long descriptive names.",1215557898

Obviously that's a silly comparison (getpid isn't really returning a constant; it's a vectored call and it has to pull the PID out of a structure offset from %%fs). But here's a fairer fight: getpid vs. a trivial LFSR:<p><pre><code>        s = (s >> 1) ^ (-(s & 1) & 0xd0000001);\n</code></pre>\nI also timed it the way you asked, with wall clock time over 100M iterations (10M runs too fast to time). Surprising even me, getpid wins by almost a full second.<p>Got another challenge for me to write code for?",1215557359

240460,comment,240325,240325,0,0,kleinsch,,,"It's tough to start working on something after you just got home from an 8 hour stretch of work. Some of the things I've done are:<p>- In the beginning, start projects on weekends or holidays. If you're not already burned out, you can get a solid start on something that will carry you through the work week. It's tough to start something at 9 PM, but if you've got a foundation, you can come up with 1-2 hours of work and not feel disappointed that you didn't do more.<p>- Pick a project that will allow you to accomplish things in 1-2 hour work sessions. If you try to build the next Google, you probably will never have a working result. If you try to build a simple app, you can take it in small pieces, adding functionality in short work sessions.<p>- Pick tools/projects different from what you do at work. Tired of lousy source control systems at work? Use Git for your next project. Tired of J2EE/Spring/Struts? Use Ruby on Rails or Python. The goal here is to make your project different from your work activities, so it doesn't seem like an extension of your work day. This also lets you pick up other technologies you might not have a chance to learn through work.<p>- Find somebody else to work with. If you have a friend to encourage you, you'll be more motivated and can split the work, getting more done.",1215556564

His specific points are valid, except I'm not sure what's wrong with references in Perl.<p>I still much prefer Perl over Python and C++ over C, and I would recommend my preferences even to a beginner.  The steeper learning curves are justified by the power.  I disagree with his assertion that you should choose a language on the basis of how easy it is to learn.

Interesting thing about regex---python itself uses perl compatible regex, so throw that item on the trash heap. As for the other its shorthand for grab a file from the command line, open it, Feed each line(\n terminated) to $_(could just as easily been a declared variable, but $_ is always there) and parse it with the regex. While you're at it, throw away the first and second parts, set $_ to the third part and continue. After that get another string from the file. All of this is covered in Wrox's Perl for Beginners as well as else where. I've done reasonable projects in both languages. Don't have anything bad to say about Python--- just wonder what all of the 'have to prove my language is better' crap is coming from...",1215556360

Due to the way the terms worked, most of the people with stock options ended up with a few hundred dollars.<p>As you might expect, the operations were slowly wound down and everything moved to the buyer's head offices state side.

Recently, however, it's a little worse because I actually do have less time to work on my own projects than I did before.  So most of the time I can't work on my own projects, even if I wanted to, because I have other priorities and responsibilities.<p>So at times I feel frustrated when I wish I was hacking and learning but I can't.  And it's not that I'm unhappy when I'm not hacking (I am very happy), it's just that I never get a chance to do what I _really_ want to be doing.<p>And the root of the problem is not that there isn't enough time or lack of energy.  The problem is that most of my time is spent at a job where I'm not doing what I like to do, and it is draining.  I'm a software tester, and I test other people's buggy software without even having the chance to fix it myself because there's a hard line between Engineering/QA (coders/testers) in this company.<p>However, even if I was working as a full-time programmer I would probably not be doing what I like doing anyway.  I'd still be a monkey (or robot, however you look at it) coding what other people (i.e. PM) have badly designed.<p>So after reading some of PG's essays, I came to the realization that the solution to my problem is to start a startup.  I'm young enough to take the risk, and the worse thing that could happen if it fails would be to look for another, better job possibly in a startup where corporate culture is frowned upon.  And then maybe correct the mistakes I (or my team) made the first time around and try again.<p>I'm kind of rambling here now, so I'll just end it now by saying that if you don't think you'll ever find a job where you will do what you love to do, you should start a startup instead of keeping that day job.  If that's too far-fetched of an idea you would pursue, well then others here have posted some good suggestions.",1215555025

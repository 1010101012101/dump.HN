You wouldn't get enough from secondhand vapor to have psychoactive effects, let alone come anywhere near toxicity. Here is some reference to an indoor air quality showing vaping to not harm other people:  www.ivaqs.com<p>Here is reference to a study showing that nicotine did not promote lung cancer growth:  <a href=""http://www.aacr.org/home/public--media/aacr-in-the-news.aspx?d=2318"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aacr.org/home/public--media/aacr-in-the-news.aspx...</a><p>All sorts of things we take in can ""promote cancer growth"". Nicotine by itself is so far from a carcinogen that IARC doesn't even investigate it as one. There are roughly 50 components of tobacco and tobacco smoke called the ""Hoffman analytes"" which are the carcinogens. There are studies showing the relative cardiovascular and cancer risk, and the worst carcinogens are produced by burning plant material. These are not present in ecigs.<p>Some studies which are dubious because of the choice of equipment and researchers not simulating the way ecigs are actually used have shown a handful of components way down the list of dangerous ingredients. Other studies have been done where these didn't even show up, but we are talking about things like formaldehyde and acetaldehyde near the level put out by smoking. If you compare the cancer risk of these to smoking, you are still looking at less than 5% of the cancer risk of smoking (probably under 1% really).",1367139468

5620661,comment,5620307,5620632,2,0,derefr,,,"> Any ownership model other than collective ownership takes these decisions out of the hands of those most qualified to make them and shifts them to hierarchy and regulations.<p>Why are you assuming a hierarchy? It could just as well be a flat sibling-space, where people ""own"" code in the property-rights sense, not the management-fiat sense. (In other words, they own it because management won't apply the force necessary to take <i>away</i> the ownership they hold by default.)<p>Imagine a conglomerate--say, Microsoft. Does the Windows division ""own"" Windows, or can the Office division make commits to it if they need to? In this case, management would probably have to intercede to <i>get</i> someone from Office commit-access to Windows. Not because management is denying that access in a command-and-control manner; that access (keys et al) is just held inside the Windows division itself, and it takes special measures to get it if you don't work there.<p>Same idea here, but on a smaller scale. Maybe each developer keeps their own git repo for their module and only pushes <i>releases</i> (e.g., .deb files of compiled code) to the central repository. Maybe each developer runs their own SOA service and everyone else is expected to only interact with it over RPC, not to muck with its internals. Etc.",1367139223

To get a different playlist, you change stations. Indeed every type of music is covered by those 6,000 stations. And of course it used to be even more diverse, in the days of the purely live DJ, before the radio business began to fade and broadcasters cut expenses by moving to networked systems like the former Westwood One.<p>You also used to be able to call up just about any station and make a song request. I'm sure you won't like that comparison to picking a song digitally, but it's the same, and it was very archaic, but no different than some of the other technological leaps we've made in which old technology seems very embarrassingly primitive. You often had to use a phone to make those requests, and a phone was a marvel in its day.<p>The technological difference can be compared, in regards to distribution, ease of access, etc. In that case, Spotify / Pandora win, that's obvious. It's not that you couldn't access every type of music via radio stations, it's that it was a lot less practical. Technology leaped forward and vastly improved the situation.<p>Spotify is very easy to compare against the radio business. What they've done is consolidate the radio market down into one platform. The Internet ate the broadcaster, very simply, just like it ate old Ma Bell. I can also compare IP telephony against the old telephony system.",1367138936

I don't think it's appreciated enough in the maker community what kind of impact this will have.<p>I'm a software engineer dabbling in electrical engineering. A while ago an EE friend of mine showed me how to use a transistor to power a motor using a GPIO pin on my Raspberry Pi. I was so stoked when it finally worked! I could turn wheels by typing ""echo ""1"" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio4/value"" into my ssh session.<p>Within 10 minutes I was able to churn out a web interface that has two buttons, forward and backward, that you can access from a mobile device to drive around your raspberry pi. I had already hooked up a battery pack and webcam before. Suddenly, within minutes of ""making the wheels turn from software"", we had a remote controlled robot with a camera! All this is possible on an Arduino (I hear you can actually run Linux on it if you put some effort in), but it'll be much more work. For the Raspberry Pi, I simply popped in an SD card with Debian and installed all my favorite tools.<p>By all means, I love writing low level C code and fiddling with basic microprocessors. I once hacked a DVR frontpanel into an alarm clock that makes you do arithmetic to stop the alarm. It was super fun. The chip didn't have any memory management and if you weren't careful your stack or heap would overwrite the program in memory. Between that, displaying custom bitmap fonts, correctly addressing the LCD display etc it took about a week to finish the project. On a Raspberry Pi you could do this in one afternoon using any language/tools you like.",1367136090

There are several reasons for that. Let's say the economy of X is down because it is inherently weak. Do you fine them because of it? Do you think that would help their economy? Also, if half the economies are breaking the rules, how are you going to get a majority in the EU parliament for bringing those fines?",1367136007

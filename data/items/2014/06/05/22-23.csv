An event where most people think they&#x27;ll change the world (which is not bad per se) but who also think they&#x27;re smarter than &quot;the others&quot; is kind of crap.<p>I often see that this crowd is addicted to the &quot;movement&quot; itself, not to getting things done. Meaning they like stories and knowing who bought who, etc. I&#x27;ve talked to too many, and they have crappy ideas they would&#x27;ve known are crappy if they&#x27;ve ever talked to another person about it.<p>They like to use jargon (A/B testing, alpha gamma shit rays and what not, to seem like they&#x27;re really doing stuff).<p>There&#x27;s someone who posted a blog post that his website is now open to the public and that beta testing has ended and people don&#x27;t need invites to sign up. I tried to sign up, and I got prompted for an invite code. How dumb must someone be, to take care of the blog before taking care of the actual code?<p>I emailed him telling him his site still prompts for an invite(what&#x27;s worse, is that he managed to take off the input field, but didn&#x27;t change the code to account for that).<p>He didn&#x27;t reply. He wrote an API that used a non HTTPS website, flagged by myWOT as malicious.<p>The app he was trying to make was about a wallet, to handle payments.<p>How much retard (excuse for the word) one needs to have in himself to manage that combo?<p>I saw him bitch about life on TV, that the authorities don&#x27;t do anything to encourage inventions and young entrepreneurs. Um, yeah buddy. It&#x27;s the others&#x27; fault, always. (And I sent emails to him warning him about these things: site flagged, impossible to register to the site, etc).",1402009187

It&#x27;s completely backward (see: gyms, insurance, etc.)<p>The only way to incentivize a company to provide the best service possible is to tie the use of the service to its cost.

7855145,comment,7852296,7853070,4,0,cstrahan,,,"Some extra background on `$`, for the curious:<p>Function application in Haskell is expressed like so:<p>> f x<p>Where `f` is a function, and `x` is it&#x27;s argument. Function application is left associative, so<p>> f x y<p>Is equivalent to<p>> (f x) y<p>In this case, `(f x)` yields a new function, to which `y` is then applied (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying</a>).<p>The function `$` that you mention is just application:<p>> f $ x = f x<p>So, using `$` infix like so<p>> f $ x<p>Is equivalent to<p>> f x<p>And likewise<p>> delay (1/4) $ p1<p>is equivalent to<p>> (delay (1/4)) p1<p>with extra parenthesis to make associativity clear.<p>This begs the question: when is `$` ever a useful function? There are two cases that come to mind:<p>1) Precedence. `$` has the lowest precedence of any function, and can thus be used to omit otherwise necessary parens; this<p>> f (g x)<p>is equivalent to<p>> f $ g x<p>2) Use in higher order functions. Imagine you have a function `all` that takes a predicate function `f` and a list of values `xs` and returns `True` if `f x` returns `True` for all `x` in `xs`. So `all (> 3) [4,5,6]` returns `True`. But, imagine now that you have a list of predicates and one value: can you still make use of `all` in this case?\nYes, you could do something like this:<p>> all (\\f -> f 42) [even, (> 3), (< 100)]<p>But that&#x27;s a little verbose. If we look at `(\\f -> f 42)`, all it&#x27;s doing is taking a function and immediately applying  `42` to it - hey, that sounds like `$` if it was partially applied to `42`! Here&#x27;s a simpler version of the previous expression:<p>> all ($ 42) [even, (> 3), (< 100)]<p>So that&#x27;s pretty much all there is to `$` and why one may omit it in the original expression.",1402008991

While they often look like friendly get togethers, it&#x27;s more often than not just somebody making money off of you, some with better value, some with less. When I worked for one of the big four, I was sent to conferences costing $5.000 a ticket and wondered who would ever pay for this craziness other than the big corps? - And there I met so many young CEOs from various early stage startups with mostly mediocre ideas trying to make the most of it. And all they could do was talking to other startups. Usually, best advise is to fly out to a conference but don&#x27;t attend.

When they get filled on an order at a price on 1 exchange it is used as one of many signals to indicate if their pricing is accurate.

7855089,comment,7853759,7854187,5,0,nhaehnle,,,"In my experience the best way to answer this question is by asking a different question: How do bank transfers work? That is, when you, as a regular person, transfer money electronically from your account to somebody else&#x27;s, what&#x27;s actually happening on a technical level?<p>Obviously, both banks that are involved adjust their databases to reflect the change in balances. But now your bank owes you less, and the other person&#x27;s bank owes <i>their</i> customer more. This is only fair if some form of <i>settlement</i> occurs between the banks.<p>In principle, this settlement could happen in cash, but that would be extraordinarily wasteful (because of the overhead of handling cash). You really want some form of electronic settlement.<p>As a first approximation, the electronic inter-bank-settlement works by all banks having an account at the central bank, and transactions at the consumer level are reflected by corresponding transactions at the level of central bank accounts. (Obviously, reality is more complicated both because it makes sense to aggregate lots of small transactions into a few bigger ones, and because the whole system has grown organically without anybody designing it from first principles.)",1402008093

At what point do we write off the machinations of a political machine as the intricacies of a complicated system, or vice versa? Do we merely ignore common threads that point to a single motive as conspiratorial thinking, or do we act assuming the worst?<p>I&#x27;m not so naive as to think the NSA has become what it is through the directions of a single person or group. I mostly agree that you hit the nail on the head, but the fact remains that many people in our current administration were given a high level overview of current processes, projects, and operations and gave the O.K. to not only continue in the current direction, but intensified efforts, brushing aside the consequences and ramifications that only a stupid person would have ignored.

There are many that will see junior, and will move on, because they need someone with more team skills, or skills in architecture, large application development, etc, that they do not expect to see from &#x27;junior&#x27; developers.<p>If someone tells me they have been working on web development related tasks for ten years, but consider themselves junior, then I worry that they have not applied themselves, or stuck to the same job long enough to actually improve their skills, etc.  THESE worries...are why I wouldn&#x27;t hire them. I would have concerns around their ability to grow and learn within my organization, and whether or not the time and money I would pour into their training would pay off in the future with a well skilled and well rounded member on my team, rather than another trip to the well of talent for another junior developer to try to help &#x27;level up&#x27; to a different role.",1402007772

7855018,comment,7854239,7854832,8,0,tunesmith,,,"The government isn&#x27;t one thing.  It might be worth doing some reading on systems thinking, for instance some of the writing by Donella Meadows.  People inhabit a government system and they either set boundaries for themselves, or have those boundaries asserted onto them; boundaries between their area of influence and other areas of the system they consider out of bounds.  If they didn&#x27;t, no one would be able to focus and get things done.<p>People often think that the failings of a system are chiefly because of the motivations of the actors in the system.  But what&#x27;s more accurate is that the failings are often because of the structure of the system, and the inhabitants often don&#x27;t feel they have the ability to change the structure.<p>The least effective way to change the behavior of a system is to twiddle the various buttons and knobs that each inhabitant has ready access to.  The most effective way to change the behavior of a system is to change the overall goal of the system, which would necessitate a complete restructuring.<p>So that&#x27;s why it is easy to believe that various NSA wrongdoings aren&#x27;t entirely because of nefarious motivations (although that is probably part of it), and very much driven by system structure (log and analyze data) that simply weren&#x27;t &quot;checked&quot; as their technological tools and abilities increased over time.  What many of us have failed to realize is that our own personal security has been a form of security-through-obscurity in the past.  We can put personal data up on a website and not tell anyone, and before search spiders, it might have stayed private.  But we can&#x27;t expect such a website to stay private these days, because of how technology has increased.  It&#x27;s the same with our private data, and how our browsing habits can be mined to create freakishly accurate personal profiles.  There was never any privacy protection there to begin with other than obscurity, and we just convinced ourselves it was there by believing in social mores that hadn&#x27;t been challenged until technology increased too much.<p>Meanwhile, the health system was about constructing an entirely new structure/system for health insurance, benefits, and penalties.<p>So... I wouldn&#x27;t say it is a matter of compartmentalizing.  It&#x27;s more a matter of appreciating that the government is a huge collection of disparate systems and motivations, and that there can be simultaneous breakdowns and successes.",1402007062

As you say, I think her point was that because she now works in education, she may not have kept up with the latest specific developments in the industry (new languages, libraries, tools etc), but she has a lot more knowledge about how to teach general CS skills to students, so that they are able to go out and learn modern specifics themselves (which of course will have changed significantly in the time they finish their education).<p>I think a lot of HN readers are missing the background to and context of this article though, which is that the author&#x27;s talking about the UK secondary school system (11-18 year olds), which has been going through significant changes in the way computer science is taught.<p>When I learnt IT/CS at school, the correct answer to &quot;How do you secure a computer&quot; was &quot;Make sure it isn&#x27;t near the edge of a desk and there are no cables trailing across the floor&quot; - answers involving passwords and firewalls were actually marked as incorrect. Formal education before university provided very little information which was actually relevant.<p>In the past year or so though, the government has changed the curriculum to be more practical and relevant. However, my understanding is that a lot of IT teachers didn&#x27;t have a background in CS, so although they were happy at the level of tidying cables, they lacked the technical knowledge required to explain the new syllabus. That&#x27;s insultingly simplified and generalised of course, but you get the idea.<p>Because the new syllabus was brought in in a rush following much political fanfare, questions were raised about how to bring these teachers up to speed in a short amount of time. I haven&#x27;t followed the situation closely, but I believe that one solution which was pushed by government was that the industry should step in to save the day, despite the fact that they know sod all about teaching, and that their skill sets are often too topical and transient to be of any actual use to students.

Mr. Brown&#x27;s inventory is in an incredibly volatile asset. He wants to reduce the volatility of his asset, so he hedges by some sort of asset that has a negative correlation with the value of the inventory he is selling. He is not an investor, he is a hedger. Now, this particular hedge product Mr. Brown chose does not have a high volume on the exchange in his local country, but in another country, it is much more liquid. Without hft, he is looking at significantly high prices to buy this asset because of the wide bid-ask spread (he will have to cross the spread to place a market order). A hft company can look at this as an arbitrage opportunity. A hft can take the market on both sides (become the highest bid and the lowest ask) because they know they can buy the asset in the foreign market, sell it in the domestic market, and then convert the currency back to their desired currency. They will obviously have to do the math, but there is most likely a risk-free trading opportunity for the hft.

You have useless information and the relevant information is spread out into a dozen boxes.<p>1. You don&#x27;t need to list that you&#x27;re a male. (I&#x27;d also argue you don&#x27;t need your d.o.b)<p>2. You don&#x27;t need the professional area. If you&#x27;re submitting the resume, the employer already knows what sector you&#x27;re in. If someone stumbles across the resume, your experience and skills should make it clear what you can do. The box takes up space and it typecasts you.<p>3. If they see your resume, you&#x27;re definitely looking for a job. You don&#x27;t need a whole box to say it.<p>4. Don&#x27;t put a salary requirement. Forgetting some people&#x27;s taboo about explicitly discussing salary, it can only hurt you. Why would any one pay you 80k if you&#x27;re telling them that they can pay you 60k.<p>5. The timeline is useless. First, it stops you from providing extra context (I have no idea what Sherman Curl LLC is.) Second, it highlights the 3.5 year gap between Massage Therapist and the rest of your work. It&#x27;s better to elaborate on a few relevant jobs then to list every thing you&#x27;ve ever done.<p>6. You don&#x27;t use the legend on the bottom of the timeline, it just tells me you used resumup. I&#x27;m beating a dead horse, but your website should have the visual resume, not the downloadable pdf. Your downloaded resume should just be your relevant information.<p>7. You say you have a diploma but you do not say what you got it in or where it&#x27;s from. That whole box is useless.<p>8. Hobbies in general are extraneous, yours are especially since none of them are close to notable or unique (although they&#x27;re a lot of fun.) I also have no idea what electronic hobbies are.<p>9. The language box has nothing in it.<p>10. Personality traits aren&#x27;t binary and, as an employer, I&#x27;d probably want to make those judgements myself. Your skills and experience are more important.<p>11. The skills graphs are confusing. I don&#x27;t want to spend time trying to understand things that could be put in a list format. Finally, you don&#x27;t fill all of the form boxes in the skill chart.<p>12. Your url is your resume, which has the same information I&#x27;m looking at. I normally would reccomend linking to your homepage, but since you&#x27;re doing multi-level-marketing on it, I&#x27;m not sure where you want the link to point, maybe github.<p>I think this is harsher then I intended, but it&#x27;s important for your first impression (your resume) to be a good one.<p>TL:DR: Your downloadable resume, even more then your digital one, should strictly be relevant information about your name, email, skills and experience.",1402006203

7854930,comment,7854504,7854504,4,0,dasil003,,,"The idea that the 2014 stack is more complex than the 2010 belies the author&#x27;s youth and lack of perspective.  2014 is not especially more complex than 2010.  I mean granted there is more CSS and web technologies to know, that stuff is certainly moving faster than it did in say 2000-2004, and so there is a higher bar for what is possible.  But the biggest difference between 2010 and 2014 is better tools.  And to be perfectly clear, by tools I mean very broadly anything developers use to get the job done, languages, frameworks, browsers, services, etc.  Developers weren&#x27;t learning and mastering fewer things ten years, they were just mastering stupider things like IE6 layout bugs.<p>Assuming the same knowledge of contemporary tech, the 2014 developer can do more with less than the 2010 developer.  The stack is only bigger if you have reason to make it bigger, which is far from a foregone conclusion.  LAMP is more effective today than it was in 2010 because HTML/CSS/JS/PHP are better (and frankly LAMP was already moving off the bleeding edge a decade ago, not in 2010).  Now obviously the development of JS frameworks and nosql databases has progressed significantly, so that potentially adds to the layers you can employee and the things to learn, but none of those things are required to be &quot;full-stack&quot;.  All that stuff could be done before, you just had to roll your own or use earlier-gen tech that was maybe not as optimal.  Certainly heavy javascript was already well-entrenched by 2010.<p>The crux of the matter is defining &quot;full-stack&quot;? The author talks as if this is about being up to speed with all facets of the latest web tech, but that is a useless definition.  There is simply too much tech now for anyone to know it all in any meaningful capacity.  Of course I agree with the author that there are a lot of useless blowhards out there talking about being &quot;full-stack&quot; developers.  This is because we are well into year 2 or 3 of &quot;full-stack&quot; being a cargo-culted buzzword that is latched onto by posers and wannabes from all walks of tech life.<p>But like all such overplayed ideas, &quot;full-stack&quot; has a legitimate origin.  It comes from the fact that the web was really developed and evolved by two distinct sets of people.  You had the programmers who were back-end focused (because javascript was not treated as a serious language for the first 10 years of its existence despite rapid ubiquity), and you had the web designers pushing visual design, first through HTML and then additionally CSS.  It took a long time to close the gap between these two groups, and during that time, it was very rare to find anyone with any talent in web design who could program or vice-versa.  In the mid-2000s once a few people started to achieve the requisite 10k hours of practice, true full-stack developers started to appear, and since then as the web became something that people had grown up with from early childhood, the number of people who built things end-to-end on the web only increased.<p>For a short time, &quot;full-stack&quot; was a pretty strong distinction because it meant a passion and focus on the web as a unique platform at a time when most top talent was immigrating from other disciplines.  Today, however, everyone attending a bootcamp as a career move is training to be &quot;full-stack&quot; because that&#x27;s simply what the HR people demand.  It&#x27;s completely orthogonal from whether someone is a good developer, and it&#x27;s at least partially orthogonal from any list of particular skills—it just means someone can build both the front-end and back-end of a web app in some form; the specifics and expectations of which vary widely from job to job.",1402006179

Why are you locking yourself just into &quot;Web Developer&quot;?<p>Well, that&#x27;s my rage... Lots of answers from friends, basically, they are all afraid of tools they&#x27;ve never used, and they don&#x27;t even bother to try them out.<p>I like to do any kind of work, from deployment scripts, load balancers, distributed computing, web front-end, desktop front-end, mobile, database, hell, i like to be part of all the entire project!! I&#x27;ve have a lot of luck because i&#x27;ve always been in small companies, and maybe we don&#x27;t deliver the best solution, but the solutions work, and work really well, i have developed lots of systems, and they are not a headache to support, so i&#x27;m proud of what we have achieved...<p>But recently, when people ask you &quot;what kind of developer are you&quot;, you can&#x27;t just say &quot;i&#x27;m a developer&quot;, because, i don&#x27;t know why, but people assume that you don&#x27;t know Web, SQL, FrontEnd, etc...

A frontend developer can be really bad frontend developer, but he&#x27;s a frontend developer because he wants to do only that and is happy whit that...<p>I believe a Full Stack developer is a guy that is not afraid to solve a problem in any stack of the system, not a guru or a genius.<p>Well, that&#x27;s my point of view.",1402006000

7512364,comment,7511749,7511749,20,0,ritchiea,,,"As a black NYC resident I&#x27;m actually surprised by this. Stop and frisk is a major violation of the rights of those stopped without cause but I have generally viewed it as more of a class issue than a race issue. I have never been stopped by the police in this manner. I was once stopped by the police on the iffy charge that I was in the park after dark while walking home late and I told the officer I was cutting through the park because I had work in the morning and I heard about muggings in the neighborhood and the park seemed the fastest and safest way home. The cop seemed to be caught off guard and quickly ended the confrontation. Furthermore, none of my (very middle to upper middle class) black friends have complained about being victims of stop and frisk.<p>My studiomate who is a filmmaker actually spoke with some local teens who were frequently harassed by the stop & frisk policy and I felt guilty that a few meager class signifiers seem to get me off the hook so easily [0].<p>That said the author&#x27;s other accounts of having to be cautious of unintentionally provoking police do ring true my experience and stories from my family and friends.<p>0. <a href=""https://vimeo.com/87532909"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/87532909</a>",1396393009

Creating an anonymous function to map across a lazy sequence wrapping a persistent data structure doesn&#x27;t have a chance in hell against a native for loop on a native vim list. I actually did quite a bit of optimization in this area (that&#x27;s where chunked seqs came from), and it&#x27;s quite usable for many tasks, but it&#x27;s still potentially bottlenecking so I never really found myself &quot;trusting&quot; it for anything significant.<p>Of course, I am in a rather unique position of being able to bang out well optimized VimL in my sleep, so paradoxically that biases me against my own creation.",1396392885

We&#x27;ve recently had a meeting discussing this in detail, I think you&#x27;re absolutely right, it doesn&#x27;t make people feel great to get a standard response like the one you&#x27;ve received. We&#x27;ve been trying to come up with a better way to personally respond to people, which has proven quite difficult. There were 2,000+ applicants last month and I think we&#x27;re still trying to figure out the best work-flow to make each response tailored.<p>I wanted to assure though that we&#x27;ve read your email (and we do read each and every email, always), even though we sent a standard response (which I totally agree with isn&#x27;t a great method). Hope that might help and I hope we can come up with a better solution to respond to you and everyone individually in the future. If anyone has had experience on this, would love your thoughts!",1396391798

More frequent social interaction builds more trust. People felt more comfortable asking for help.<p>3. A lot of information is acquired through something called &quot;tacit learning&quot;.

The US tax code was over 71,000 pages last I checked (in 2009 or so), and that&#x27;s just the federal part. I have dealt with taxes in several jurisdictions, personal and business - and the US is by far the most onerous, most complicated among them. The business part is a little simpler than the personal part, but both are batsh*t crazy when compared to a lot of other places.<p>The differing taxation scheme seem to be quite universal these days (I don&#x27;t know if historically this wasn&#x27;t the case). The rates are effectively higher in the US, though it seems if you are big enough you can use loopholes to counter that.<p>The VAT common in Europe is onerous at the personal level (roughly comparable to state/city sales tax, although usually higher), but is almost invisible at the business level - &quot;VAT&quot; stands for &quot;Value Added Tax&quot; - it only gets paid on the added value. If my business buys laptops and supplies them to a customer, that customer pays VAT but I do not (whereas US style sales tax gets collected twice in this case). Expenses seem to be just as easily deductible, if not easier.<p>Furthermore, the US is actively hostile towards anyone who does anything financially outside the US. Got a bank account outside the US? You have a lot of onerous reporting to do (FBAR/FATCA) with very steep penalties for non compliance. Your company has such an account, and you have signing rights? You are still personally liable with the same steep penalties. Onerous does not begin to describe this.<p>If you&#x27;re already a US Tax Payer living in the US (by being a citizen or a permanent resident), the US is probably the best place for you to do business in. If you are not yet subject to the craziness that is the US Tax Code, you should factor a few tens of thousands of USD per year for proper reporting, which might make it a less desirable place.",1396389789

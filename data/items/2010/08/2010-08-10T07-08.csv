Teachers demanded writing ""in pen"" for the sake of contrast/readability and I gave it to them, but I wasn't about to deal with the hassle of a non-erasable method. But being a left handed writer, the side of my hand inevitably ended up blackened as I rested it on old text and smudged it in the process. So my works in erasable pen ended up less readable than the ones in pencil.",1281427179

I earlier responded ""God does not exists"". So there really is not contradiction as claimed by the game<p>""You claimed earlier that any being which it is right to call God must want there to be as little suffering in the world as possible. But you say that God could make it so that everything now considered sinful becomes morally acceptable and everything that is now considered morally good becomes sinful. What this means is that God could make the reduction of suffering a sin... yet you've said that God must want to reduce suffering.""<p>since I deem the premise of question 12 false (God does not exist). Again ""If God exists than she can do such and such ..."" is always true if God does not exist.<p>Furthermore I also think there might be a semantical problem in the analysis.

I used to write licensed software for a living (the first version of the webcam software was a nice example, it did several hundred K in turnover annually at some point) but I've seen the writing on the wall and closed source is not going to be around forever for code such as this. Right now you have first mover advantage, you have a very solid codebase that you have put your time and effort in and if you can roll out fast enough and wide enough you can cement your position for the next 10 years or more.<p>By open sourcing it you cut off the route where some other group of smart guys with spare time on their hands looks at what NOLOH does and re-implements it. You don't create lock-in with tools the way Microsoft could do it with office, we're not talking about end-users, we're talking about developers here.<p>They already understand the way their job is done and to a very large extent that means that they've learned the downside of relying on closed source. And as a result plenty of them now have a very simple policy: Toolchain to create my product has to be open. Especially on the BSD and linux platforms, less so on Mac and Windows.<p>The stuff you've built is aimed squarely at that BSD and Linux fraction of the market, the portion where the resistance against closed source is going to be the strongest, you're building on top of PHP which itself is an open source product.<p>So the whole chain from OS, language, probably the db and the primary language is open, then you insert a DSL or middleware (however you want that to be classed) and you undo all that.<p>So you'll find some resistance to your policy. But I find the concepts embodied in NOLOH interesting enough that I've signed up for a trial license, so who knows, I might even overcome my dislike for your licensing policies.<p>Note that MySQL made some very good money by dual  licensing their product and eventually a huge exit.

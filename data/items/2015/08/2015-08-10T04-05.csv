He knew what the purpose of the interview was, and who the audience would be. He could have simply stated that the question can be answered with varying degrees of sophistication, but an ultimate &quot;why&quot; is not to be found.<p>The journalist was in no way pretending to have any physics knowledge nor was he insinuating anything. He asked a totally reasonable question and wanted Feynman to talk about magnets, not rant about how there&#x27;s no ultimate answer to a &quot;why&quot; question.<p>Feynman was being arrogant and patronizing when he shouldn&#x27;t have been. Just search for &quot;why&quot; on this[1] page and see if he himselfs asks &quot;why&quot; questions.<p>[1]:<a href=""http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_01.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_01.html</a><p>EDIT: Alright, this turned into a tiring argument about who&#x27;s right or wrong, when in this context it&#x27;s a non-issue. People react differently to his sermon, end of the question. Is Feynman right about &quot;why&quot; questions? I think so. Was it necessary to make the point as he did when he did? I don&#x27;t think so.<p>And please stop making assumptions about me. I&#x27;m all for discussion, but you need not assume anything, just as I reciprocate.

10032724,comment,10031671,10031671,0,0,x0054,,,"I think this article in several places equates actively deleting your browser history with using an incognito mode in chrome, or another method of automatically deleting, or even preventing the creation of history all together. This is not the case, you are perfectly fine having a system that will automatically delete your history, at least for now, it&#x27;s not illegal to do that.<p>This is also why many companies have a very precise document destruction procedures. I used to run a company that was involved in the document management industry. Many companies track very closely the lifecycle of every document they create, and many have programs that will purge the document literally on the day when it can be delete. If you have to keep a document for 7 years, there are systems that will purge that document at midnight on the 7th anniversary of it&#x27;s creation.<p>This is perfectly legal as long as it&#x27;s all automatic. I think under Sarbanes-Oxley you do have an obligation to preserve evidence once the investigation is open, so you would have to disable the automated system. But as long as your documents are destroyed as soon as it&#x27;s legally possible, you are basically covered.",1439182648
10032723,comment,10032299,10032357,0,0,wpietri,,,"Yep. Not paying people properly for work is a crime. I know in California that&#x27;s a big deal. See, e.g., the crackdown a couple years back on &quot;interships&quot; that were just free jobs. And my guess is that immigration authorities would see food and lodging as payment, meaning both employer and employee would be violating the law.<p>However, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything illegal about paying an independent contractor who&#x27;s living in another country. So my suggestion to codeornocode would be to find some sort of work in the US that could be done remotely from some safe third country. Immigration authorities care a lot about displacement of their own citizens, but in the places I&#x27;ve lived they don&#x27;t give a hoot about somebody who is on a working vacation.",1439182616
10032721,comment,10031286,10031975,0,0,johncolanduoni,,,"> This is a really hair-splitting distinction that only makes sense if mathematicians wrote proofs (e.g., about commutative group theory) while keeping ZFC&#x27;s axioms in mind.<p>They may not do so explicitly, but it is easy to see where the axioms become important when dealing with mathematical structures. For example, if you are considering the group of integers with addition, the existence of this group is predicated on the existence of the integers, which is predicated on the existence of the natural numbers as a set, which is an axiom of ZFC (axiom of infinity[1]). The case for other foundations is similar.<p>> But even then, it&#x27;s not really an appropriate distinction -- accidentally assuming inconsistency and moving forward with it is exactly as far-reaching as assuming inconsistency at the foundations.<p>No, because when studying a mathematical structure we always consider concrete instances of it, which are usually in fact the motivation for the definition of the structure. So mathematics based on possibly (relatively) inconsistent structures (other than foundational systems) is not really a thing; group theory was not initiated prior to the discovery of structures satisfying the groups axioms, and neither was the study of rings, fields, modules, topological spaces etc. On the other hand, we cannot consider models of ZFC unless we build it within the assumptions of a foundational system (possibly ZFC itself). So at some point we have to pick a set of axioms to be the bottom of our ladder of turtles, and the axioms of that system are very special indeed.<p>Another difference is that the axioms of a group (or a field, or a topological space) cannot stand on their own; they clearly reference sets and functions. ZFC&#x27;s axioms only reference sets, all of the fundamental properties of which are enumerated in the axioms themselves. If you gave an (english speaking) alien the definition of a group, he would need to ask you what the definition of sets and functions were. So even if we wanted the group axioms to be our foundations, this would not be possible.<p>[1] : <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_infinity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_infinity</a>",1439182508

It&#x27;s curious that even when asking for new knowledge, people can be affronted by the implication that they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about. Physics is hardly the only field where you learn that the everyday understanding is an oversimplification, and a beginner being misled by those oversimplifications has no reason to be embarrassed.",1439181115

8863348,comment,8863149,8863149,0,0,comrade1,,,"This is nothing new.<p>I planned on being scientist in genetics/cell bio starting around 10th grade. I worked in laboratories throughout my undergrad years and then got into a prestigious human genetics phd program around 1993.<p>I first started to see that something was wrong while still an undergrad while working with people smarter than myself that were on their second or third post-doc. I had no desire to be into my career 12 years (phd + 3 2-year post-docs) and still not have a real job.<p>In graduate school I saw this continued and I also began to see just how much of a crap-shoot having a successful science career in academia was. The young professors on tenure track all had some amazing research during their phd or post-doc(s) but most often it based on something unexpected or novel that they couldn&#x27;t have predicted.<p>Finally, when the head of the NIH testified in front of congress that there is a glut of scientists and that he couldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone to go into science I decided to drop out.<p>I&#x27;ve had a great career since then outside of science but there are times when I miss it. I especially miss being around people much smarter than myself and driven purely by curiosity and the desire for knowledge. And I miss doing original research solving a fundamental question about life that is completely unknown and that can&#x27;t just be googled.<p>And there are times when I get tired of the software industry and its man-children and its lack of seriousness... I know that everything we do isn&#x27;t pointless and I&#x27;ve worked on some interesting cutting edge government/military projects that had mixed academic/industry teams, but it saddens me that so many of the smartest people in the software industry are working on essentially marketing/advertising projects. Google has become the blackhole for researchers that Microsoft Research used to be in the late-90s.<p>I&#x27;m not as negative as my post probably comes across as. I do like what I do and I have made friends with people in the software industry that are closer to my mindset than the norm. But it would have been nice to have been able to stay in science and have a better chance at being able to support myself and a family.",1420826387

Of that group at a good Canadian University, 3 are still post-docs (4-6 years after graduation), 1 has a decent-paying research position (non-teaching) and 1 is a faculty member... in the Middle East. Meanwhile, I work in an R&D field alongside many current faculty members, a surprising number of whom are 65+ and will die before they retire.<p>In general, my observation has been that the students that quit after a Masters tend to do better financially than those who continue on. That&#x27;s not to say that Master&#x27;s graduates are hitting the big time; they just tend to end up getting their market value.",1420826339

Tiny companies/Individual contractors (aka temporary workers/consultants/etc) terminate their contracts immediately.<p>For larger companies you lawyer up and negotiate restitution as per the contract with them.<p>Longer answer:
You generally get contractors in when you are resource-poor but have the budget for it. The obvious solution is take the development in-house. In real life the answer apparently to get contractors in and deal with the fallout later.<p>TLDR:

8863327,comment,8853213,8853213,0,0,AnotherMarc,,,"First off, if the stress is truly constant, I would advise you to do at least a consultation with a mental health professional. Can&#x27;t hurt, and no one here has a whole lot of context (we couldn&#x27;t). My advice for a first step is to uncover why you&#x27;re stressed feel rage with co-workers. Everyone has different ways of figuring that out, but it sounds like you&#x27;ve given it some thought, and are not sure. Hence, my suggestion.<p>If you have any relationship issues or anxiety about your upcoming kid (congrats by the way!), that could spill over. When my first was on her way, marriage was all good (still is), and I was excited to be a parent. But I was still nervous as hell, and I&#x27;m sure some of that nervousness spilled over to other areas.<p>However, it seems as if this might be a pattern for you, and so I come back to figuring out why. If you don&#x27;t figure it out, any change you make is likely to result in the same feelings shortly after you make a change. I put myself through some self directed exercises in a book called What Color Is Your Parachute. It&#x27;s geared to job seekers, but the first steps in the process are about self discovery. There are probably better tools, but that book was the one I grabbed for whatever reason one day in the bookstore. But anything that gets you thinking about what matters to you will help.<p>Good luck!",1420826105

Once they&#x27;re sited and hooked into the lines, replacing the gear inside is not difficult.<p>The question is whether a regulated monopoly could provide good broadband connectivity at a good price. Equipment upgrade scheduling is an implementation detail.<p>And it&#x27;s a detail that is already priced into the service. It should be possible for such a monopoly to provide the same level of connectivity as Verizon or Comcast at lower prices, because for their current prices Verizon and Comcast already provide that level of connectivity <i>plus</i> content and software and marketing.<p>Big ISPs do everything necessary for connectivity, but they also develop and sell products that run on that connectivity. For example Comcast&#x27;s on-demand and DVR everywhere solutions compete directly with services like Netflix, HBO Go, NBC.com, ESPN 3, etc. Developing, maintaining, and marketing that costs Comcast a lot of money--money that a connectivity-only monopoly would not need to spend.<p>It would be like if your electric company owned the lines, owned the power station, and sold you appliances like TVs and washing machines. Instead, electric companies just sell electricity, and everyone else sells you things that use electricity.

I&#x27;m in the business of making software.<p>If I have a critical project that must be done right and done on time, I will not hire junior developers for the team. It&#x27;s nothing against the jr. dev., but in these scenarios I just need the A-Team showing up and I don&#x27;t have time to setup a training regimen.<p>Yes, it would be great if there were a good means to train and bring up new developers. Most of the universities in the world are failing to train people to be good developers. Maybe we need a master&#x27;s of engineering in software development, with a real engineering certification at the end (and not the IEEE bullshit one that has nothing to do with software development). Sure, the top-tier engineering schools like MIT and CMU are putting out good, jr. devs., but most people in the market didn&#x27;t get to go to one of those schools. Most people went to your run of the mill state school, where nobody cared enough to buck the status quo and fail them out of their classes if they couldn&#x27;t hack it. That any good developers come out of such a system is despite the system. The pressure to keep graduation rates up has done a monumental disservice to everyone involved.<p>Sports teams have farm leagues they can run and groom out excellent players.

Knuth is great, but it&#x27;s <i>dense</i>, even when you discount the use of MIX.<p>Definitely take a look at SICP (<a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html</a>) and the related HTDP (<a href=""http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/</a>) -- both will require you to get used to Scheme (it&#x27;s good for you!), but will expose you to the underlying theory of <i>how</i> to compute, which is critical.<p>Before those two, you could also start with O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s &quot;Understanding Computation,&quot; which is a bit more Ruby-centric than I prefer, but a non-rigorous take on the same subjects. Petzold&#x27;s &quot;Code&quot; is also a good, non-specialist place to start. (Petzold&#x27;s &quot;Annotated Turing&quot; is great, but I&#x27;d leave it for a while.)<p>You should read the &quot;Schemer&quot; series (Little, Seasoned, Reasoned) -- again, lots of Scheme, but wonderful if somewhat idiosyncratic reads.<p>Going back in time, Wirth&#x27;s &quot;Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs&quot; is a classic in the field, and a pleasure to read.<p>CLRS&#x27; &quot;Intro. to Algorithms&quot; is a foundational text on algorithm analysis and design, though you might also want to try some of the more popular treatments first (O&#x27;Reilly has a few good ones). See also Skiena&#x27;s &quot;Algorithm Design Manual.&quot;<p>The &quot;Dragon Book&quot; (Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools) by Aho, Sethi and Ullman is on every computer scientist&#x27;s bookshelf for good reason -- it tells you everything you need to know about how the languages you use are built. I also like Holub&#x27;s &quot;Compiler Design in C,&quot; though it&#x27;s a lot more hands-on.<p>For understanding OSes, I recommend &quot;The Magic Garden Explained,&quot; and Bach&#x27;s &quot;Design of the UNIX Operating System.&quot; Outdated, perhaps, but outstanding in their clarity.<p>C (yes, you should learn C; like Lisp, it&#x27;s <i>also</i> good for you even if you only use it rarely): King&#x27;s &quot;C Programming: A Modern Approach&quot; (though you could start with a popular introduction like O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s &quot;Head First C&quot;), Plauger&#x27;s &quot;Standard C Library,&quot; Hanson&#x27;s &quot;C Interfaces and Implementations,&quot; and O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s &quot;Understanding and Using C Pointers,&quot; as a start. Van der Linden&#x27;s &quot;Expert C Programming&quot; is an excellent intermediate text that is also surprisingly readable.<p>Architecture and design miscellanea: Kernighan&#x27;s &quot;Practice of Programming,&quot; Bentley&#x27;s &quot;Programming Pearls,&quot; McConnell&#x27;s &quot;Code Complete,&quot; and Hunt and Thomas&#x27; &quot;Pragmatic Programmer.&quot;<p>I have not yet read, but intend to, Okasaki&#x27;s &quot;Purely Functional Data Structures.&quot;<p>Make a habit of browsing second-hand bookstores and picking up older computer science books -- they cover by necessity much more foundational issues than most modern books, and do so using simpler architectures and languages. (I have a wonderful text on 68008 programming that has absolutely no practical relevance to the current age, but provides fantastic insights into the nuts and bolts of hardware and OS development.)

What you like about the new company (&quot;You guys seem to hire really good coders, you&#x27;re growing as a company, and I like your approach to A, B, and C.&quot;)<p>2. What you want to achieve at the new company (ex: &quot;I&#x27;m looking for an opportunity to do less support and more coding.&quot;)<p>3. Optionally, something about what&#x27;s bad at your current company. Preferably in a positive context. (ex: &quot;I&#x27;m really excited about building modern web applications, and I&#x27;m not able to achieve that at Company XYZ because we&#x27;ve committed to supporting IE6.0 until 2050 because it&#x27;s what the owner&#x27;s mom uses.&quot;)<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s not <i>easy,</i> but it&#x27;s.... hackable.

Go way too much into it and what you create will be deformed, mechanical processes which largely deviates from the thing&#x27;s original intention and end up worse than what it intends to replace. Look at any huge national exam system(China for example) then you&#x27;ll perfectly understand what I mean. Students get absolutely no space for personality, and nothing else than abilities to do specified types of exams get evaluated. No holistic abilities at all. A process with space for subjectivity certainly isn&#x27;t perfect, but it allows so much more to be evaluated than purely mechanical and many times deformed narrow &quot;skill sets&quot;, if so can be called. I remember reading Peter Thiel say PayPal didn&#x27;t recruit a guy because &quot;he loved playing basketball&quot;, although all other attributes looked great. That might be a little bit extreme but it says a lot about how hiring, and generally admission processes, isn&#x27;t a precision science, and that&#x27;s actually probably how lots of decision-makers want it to be. It requires dynamism, interactions and gauging between people. Simple blind mechanical assessment results aren&#x27;t equal to &quot;justice&quot; in any way.

I think it&#x27;s a good starting point and has some helpful reminders.<p>As always, there are some really great and insightful comments and suggestions here, but I&#x27;m a bit surprised about the overwhelming negativity around code reviews and this post.<p>FogCreek&#x27;s post is just a starting point, and they said so right in the post. It wasn&#x27;t intended to be taken as the end-all-be-all of code review checklists, but that seems to be getting ignored, sometimes in favor of unconstructive criticism.<p>It&#x27;s a decent starting point, and the main takeaway is that there are lots of angles to think about when reviewing commits, every single time, not just whether the code works. It&#x27;s easy to forget all the angles because code reviews are hard to always do well, so having a checklist, even with redundant items or minutiae really isn&#x27;t the awful idea it&#x27;s being made out to be.<p>The included video, which based on comments I&#x27;d be forced to guess almost nobody watched, also clarifies their process and intent, and addresses some of the comments here, for example pair programming. Joel mentions pair programming being the most extreme form of code reviews. In my own experience, he&#x27;s spot on when he says pair programming is really useful in certain situations, and very hard to use frequently.<p>One angle that hasn&#x27;t been discussed that that a long checklist is actually a good thing when it comes to justifying time spent code reviewing to managers (as well as fellow coders). In my own experience, I&#x27;ve witnessed the attitude that code review time is unproductive, and the thinking that code reviews shouldn&#x27;t take long. Having a specific process that demands a minimum amount of attention is a good thing on its own, completely outside of the benefits to the code and code quality.<p>Edit: spelling",1420825062

If/when GPUs get almost entirely subsumed into CPUs (I don&#x27;t have any 3D requirements, and I&#x27;m typing this on my first, 1 year old computer with integrated into the CPU graphics), I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll invalidate their &quot;success by specialization&quot;.<p>However, I think I&#x27;ll still go with my thesis on the Amiga: the failure to gain sufficient market share and therefore volume, plus poor to bad management, doomed it just like the Lisp Machines.  And perhaps the NRE costs on the chipset, perhaps the experience of doing it and facing having to do it again, deterred the managers from going for 3D.<p>As for modern PCs ... I&#x27;m not sure I really buy it.  Look at all the discrete TTL in the original PC motherboard: <a href=""http://mit-a.com/disp/mb1.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mit-a.com/disp/mb1.shtml</a>  Look at all the TTL in standard cards for it: <a href=""http://www.minuszerodegrees.net/5150_5160/cards/5150_5160_cards.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.minuszerodegrees.net/5150_5160/cards/5150_5160_ca...</a>  And a <i>2nd</i> generation 3com Ethernet card: <a href=""http://sishardware.com/unt/20622-3com_etherlink_ii_tp_6330___01_10mbps_8_bit_isa_ethernet_card_rj45__aui___at_xt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sishardware.com/unt/20622-3com_etherlink_ii_tp_6330__...</a>  All computers, especially all designed for volume production, looked like that, and were filled with cards like that.<p>I submit that the steady accumulation of all that logic into fewer and fewer ASICs, and much eventually into the CPU (nowadays memory controller and PCIe lanes) and a single chip &quot;chipset&quot;, is just natural cost reduction aligned with (massive) volume sales.

8863203,comment,8860738,8862955,0,0,NoMoreNicksLeft,,,"> Wow. Way to grossly oversimplify one of the most important public policy issues of our time. You can&#x27;t ignore externalities that affect student performance a<p>I can.<p>If I hire a contractor to build a house in the shape of a giant ice cream cone, then I expect that result. At the very most, he should shortly conclude that it is not possible (I&#x27;d still be liable to pay him for some reasonable hours that it took to come to that realization). But if he can&#x27;t do it, he can&#x27;t just keep billing hours not doing it.<p>They&#x27;re paid commensurate with their results.<p>> I think that idea is so implausible that it&#x27;s not worth considering. You seriously think you couldn&#x27;t lure some bright creative minds who would have done an excellent job teaching by making the profession better compensated?<p>No. See, you&#x27;re probably a bright and creative guy yourself (at least within some narrow scope). So your ego gets in the way and you assume that this means that you&#x27;d be a great teacher, if only they had signaled to you early on that you&#x27;d&#x27;ve been paid well to go into it (and you can&#x27;t switch now, it&#x27;d mean going back to college).<p>But you&#x27;re wrong. I don&#x27;t need someone who is above average in creativity to teach my children. I need someone who feels highly motivated to teach them. This is the single most important criteria to being a good teacher.<p>And the fact that you didn&#x27;t go into teaching means you&#x27;ve failed this test miserably. You failed it because you are very unmotivated... low pay, or maybe lack of respect, these things discouraged you.<p>People are somewhat fungible, in that we could <i>maybe</i> squeeze out a few thousand more good teachers. Maybe. But at that point we&#x27;re spending far more to get those last few thousand than we were to get the first few thousand good teachers. Just like anything else, we start running into diminishing returns. We&#x27;d double education spending to get even 20,000 more good teachers nationwide.<p>Is our good teacher deficit only 20,000? I&#x27;ve heard numbers more like 500,000. If we have to double it for an extra 20,000, how much will the real number cost?<p>You&#x27;re just not thinking about this clearly, and if I must be downvoted then I must... it&#x27;s more important that you people hear, however briefly, some sense on the matter.<p>> No more than any other profession considered prestigious is &quot;gamed&quot; today.<p>Yes, and that level of gaming is bizarre and culturally-suicidal. Let&#x27;s talk about those &quot;gamed&quot; professions: politicians.<p>Do you want those kind of people molding your young children (supposing you have any)? Too stupid to teach the kids anything other than manipulation and deceit, filling their heads with crackpot ideas, or just toying with them for their own amusement, and able to shrug off any scandal that malfeasance and abuse sends their way?<p>The few other prestigious professions, they&#x27;re not quite as bad as politics, but they have insanely prohibitive constraints. You can&#x27;t usually game becoming an astronaut, but a nation of 300 million only comes up with dozens that make the cut.<p>> You do realize teachers need to go through a degree program,<p>I work as a university, and every term I have to prepare a program that sends out end of term letters (probation and suspension). Which college do you think gets the most of those, per capita?<p>But perhaps the college of education is just tougher than the college of engineering. Maybe it&#x27;s a more rigorous program.<p>And the truth is, they <i>don&#x27;t need to go through a degree program</i>. When I lived in Atlanta, I saw a newspaper article where they were hiring anyone with a GED to be a teacher, age 18 and up. Seriously. Don&#x27;t remember the details, and I&#x27;m sure some part of it was that they&#x27;d put you through a degree program eventually (on your own dime or their? don&#x27;t remember), but you don&#x27;t ned a degree.<p>You just need a pulse, a blank felony record (or not?), and a birth certificate proving you were born 18 or more years ago.<p>> The government spends enough money<p>This is a child&#x27;s view of budgeting. Just because money is wasted elsewhere doesn&#x27;t mean all should be invited to waste even more money.<p>> Huh? So anyone who wants autonomy and to be well paid is a status seeker?<p>You lost track of the conversation. Though people often argue that they should be paid more, the original comment was that they should be better respected. That&#x27;s status. I concede that I added arguments to my own comment that addressed both status and pay. I&#x27;m merely clarifying: if you raise the status of the job, you get status-seekers, if you raise the pay, you get money-seekers.<p>Neither of these is anything that will improve educational outcomes. They both do however improve election results for political parties that cater to teacher&#x27;s unions.",1420824711

I think I need a bit more data on how users use the app and in what direction I should take the app and features before implementing this, but it&#x27;s very possible I will in the future.<p>-- Conditionals
Yes, I&#x27;m thinking of adding something like this, but on a higher priority I will add Triggers, so a checklist can be started automatically based on for example, a time interval or a callback over HTTP.
I will also add Outcomes, so you can set up a action that should happen when a checklist is completed, like trigger another checklist.<p>-- Finder control over headers and items
I will work on this, with the goal of making as simple as possible to get started with the first checklist, but over time be able to use more advanced features for creating items.<p>-- Extended item details
Markdown is in the backlog. Alos item audit trail, like, Frej changed the description from ... to ... (5 min ago), and so on, so you have a complete track record of changes.<p>-- Merge items from &quot;started-checklists&quot; to parent checklist.
This is something I&#x27;m going to implement pretty soon, so that, when a person perform a checklist and discovers a the need of a new item, or an obsolete existing item, they should not need to make the change first on the active checklist and the same changes on the parent checklist.<p>-- On the roadmap for the near future
Triggers (se abow), Outcomes, Audit trails for checklists & items, &quot;News feed&quot; and Notifications center is things I have on the roadmap.<p>Thanks again for your thoughts!<p>/Frej",1420824498

You don&#x27;t have access to the source of anything that happens in kernel space. You can take university OS courses and tinker with the educational toy operating systems, read about Windows internals but to see what you&#x27;re actually running is different not only at a philosophical level but also practically.<p>Yes, you can get into kernel space in Windows by doing a driver DLL, so you can make your <i>computer</i> &quot;do&quot; anything, but what you, as a <i>person</i>, will do is a lot different when dealing with a black box rather than a white box. When doing Windows kernel space driver development, you&#x27;re reading the documentation (and hope that your computer does what it says), when doing that with an open source OS, you can read the source too (and know that the computer does exactly that).<p>To me (you don&#x27;t have to agree), the essence of being a computer is that you don&#x27;t only use your computer to get work done or use it for entertainment.

Sure, you can find bugs, but the question is, how efficiently?<p>Long ago I learned a couple simple rules that get my defect rate very close to zero: asserts everywhere, and step through every line of code. Seriously. Write two lines of code, fire up the debugger, and step through them, inspecting each variable. Any tiny &#x27;unit&#x27; that you write should go through the debugger, where unit might be that 5 line function you are writing, or a bug fix, or whatever. It just catches a vast amount of the bugs if you are writing in a modular, perhaps functional style. Tons of side effects, well, it&#x27;s less good at that. asserts do &#x27;okay&#x27; at finding those things, but of course the time to find those bugs is longer.<p>This buys you a few things. First, you are &#x27;reviewing&#x27; your code while you write, which is when it is freshest in your mind. It is hard to mentally model the behavior of the computer, hence code reviews are mentally difficult. The debugger ALWAYS shows you what the computer will do (bar things like nasty thread interactions). The debugger does not lie. You get to see nasty things like Nan or underflow that might just pass silently depending on your error handling, which is again hard to find in a code review. And, of course, the sooner you find bugs the cheaper it is to fix - so the best time is about 10 seconds after you typed that line of code. After that the costs grow either proportionally or exponentially.<p>I know very few people with that uses this discipline, but it changed my life when I took it up. Any time I slip and fail to do it, I rue it.<p>Pair programming get you similar benefits. I find it harder to think/talk/respond to another person when I am deep in thought (different brain pathways, or so it feels), so I&#x27;m more a solo programmer by nature. However, I would still step through the code when pair programming; I guarantee that your mental model of your code is likely to be flawed. The second person will reduce, but not eliminate that threat.<p>I understand not all code bases/IDEs/whatever allow this (long startups, 5+ minute compiles, etc), but it it is available, avail yourself of it. If you program in a dynamic language and find yourself using a REPL all the time to test your code you are doing a form of this, but it is still better to test the actual code in place.",1420823253

It was that India is still not ready for democracy. A candidate decides to try out this election thing without any agenda and plans, and they win without any reason. They don&#x27;t even know why they won and what they can really do for the community. Giving government jobs to beggars isn&#x27;t a plan. And I&#x27;m saying this as an Indian.",1420823081

As the screen scans up and down to draw the various rows, it thus has to rapidly charge and discharge the capacitors.  The capacitors are expanding and contracting a bit as they do so, which vibrates the air and makes a tone.<p>Frankly this sounds like an awesome way to blow up those capacitors.",1420823057

Most people who claim to be feminists say that men also have a lot of problems, which are caused by gender biases.<p>It&#x27;s a load of shit to say that feminism is all about fighting male privilege. But since these radical &quot;feminists&quot; are the most outspoken people who describe themselves as feminists, they effectively define what feminism means to the public. You can say, if you want, that you think the problems men face aren&#x27;t as severe, so you think they deserve less attention. That&#x27;s a value judgement which no-one can argue with. But behaving like only women have problems is simply not honest.<p>This is really fucking dangerous, if you think that feminism (whether that means gender equality, or women&#x27;s rights) is a good thing.<p>Men (at least, the men at the top) are really more powerful than women, and this isn&#x27;t changing in the foreseeable future. Men put in the hard yards in the high-risk careers, and end up dominating politics, law, and the corporate world. As long as feminism has the moral high ground, that won&#x27;t be an issue for women, because the small number of men in really high positions still have to do what is seen as the right thing.<p>But there&#x27;s no reason why gross gender inequality can&#x27;t exist in a modern society. Look at most countries outside the US, UK, and some parts of the EU.<p>Feminism probably happened because women were needed for the war effort. The men were fighting the war, so the women were able to show they could do the work men generally did. There&#x27;s no real reason that feminism <i>needs</i> to exist in a modern society, it&#x27;s just path dependence (you can&#x27;t take a bone out of dog&#x27;s mouth - people tend to hang onto the rights they have), and the fact that most people (including most men) think that feminism is a &quot;good&quot; thing.<p>If feminism allows itself to be defined by the radicals (who use some weird Marxist analysis about the class struggle between men and women), that&#x27;s exactly what they&#x27;ll get - a class struggle. And if it does stop being about right and wrong (as it has been, up to this point) and simply about men versus women, I have no doubt that the men will gradually try to chip away at the progress feminists have made.<p>Equality is a great thing. Equality is a thing which most people see as right, and that most people will support. A class struggle is not something everyone agrees with, and it&#x27;s a war I don&#x27;t think we really want to have.<p>If things continue the way they are going, it&#x27;s not going to be long before a conservative politician can repeat the more reasonable points that men&#x27;s rights groups are making (not the angry crap about their evil ex, or stuff about sexual assault, but the bits about women having too many advantages in things like the justice system). What will the feminists say? Will they say that they are fighting biases of all kinds, or that feminism is simply about fighting teh menz?<p>If feminists start fighting against equality, there will no longer be a bright line (equality) which everyone can strive for. It will simply about the two sides trying to push each other around. If you really want to put your money where your mouth is, and bet that women will push harder, that&#x27;s a matter for you. I&#x27;m not really well read on the history of sexism, but I&#x27;d bet there&#x27;s a lot more historical examples of men eroding the rights of women than women eroding the rights of men.",1373924119

Western society has drastically limited mobility right now, and the highest ranks are, unfortunately, more conservative in their views on gender.<p>And as an aside, there&#x27;s a good example of a broader application of Kleinfeld&#x27;s thesis there.

And, when you make this choice, you are excluding certain kinds of participants and inviting others.

What happens when we&#x27;re not using a &quot;web browser&quot;?<p>A few days ago, I was actually downvoted for even suggesting that a user could disable JavaScript and that this might reduce her vulnerability to exploits.  I&#x27;m always fascinated by the strength of the bias in favor of JavaScript.<p>I&#x27;m guessing that so many developers are now so heavily invested in JavaScript that if it were to become less popular they believe they would suffer somehow.  They will thus defend this language with fervor.  That&#x27;s my guess.<p>Days ago we saw Dan Bricklin, who is no stranger to a world without a web browser and is responsible for the app that literally launched the PC into the mainstream, put in his plug for JavaScript.  But we also learned he&#x27;s written entire spreadhseet applications in JavaScript.  It appears he&#x27;s heavily invested in this language.  It stands to reason he would defend its use.<p>On this thread someone mentioned that Bill Joy thought Java applets would power the web.  Not surprising considering his company was responsible for Java, and he has called James Gosling, the father of Java, his favorite programmer.<p>I think when we look at JavaScript we need to ask ourselves who stands to gain the most from it.  My belief is that it benefits developers more than users.  It&#x27;s aesthetically pleasing to most developers, but more importantly, programming in JavaScript requires less work than using a language with manual memory management that does not expect to be run inside another application (a &quot;web browser&quot;).  JavaScript boosts productivity.<p>Users, I believe, do not see the same benefits.  (e.g. I have seen Marissa Mayer while at Google state how important speed is to users.  We might accept that speed is one benefit that users would recognize.)<p>Because the love for .js is so strong and criticism of it is not well received, I won&#x27;t go into any more detail. But suffice it to say, if there are problems with using JavaScript, I believe it is not developers who would suffer the most from them.  I believe it is users who would bear the burden.",1373923731

And yet it&#x27;s still not that easy to make a well selling automobile.<p>The number of new automakers who enter the market over time and do very well is very small.<p>The thing about Tesla is not that they managed to make an electric car, the important thing is they managed to make one with all of the right tradeoffs and design choices to be a car that people actually wanted to buy. That&#x27;s a big deal even for conventional automobiles.<p>Moreover, Tesla has done the most important thing possible with electric cars: they&#x27;ve made them no longer a joke. That will make a much bigger difference in the future decades regardless of whether Tesla continues to succeed or not. Now that electric cars are in many people&#x27;s eyes a legitimate, and even perhaps enviable, vehicle to own people will start evaluating them on the merits and increasingly choosing to buy them. Which will lead to more and more successful electric car models and companies and a snowball effect in terms of the amount of cumulative profits from electric car sales which will get plowed back into R&D for electric car development. All of which is an absurdly huge win for electric vehicles.<p>Now, it&#x27;s not as though Musk did something absurdly special with Tesla (heck, he didn&#x27;t even found the company), but there&#x27;s a strong argument he didn&#x27;t do so with SpaceX either. The Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 are not technological marvels, they&#x27;re simply, practical sensible designs well-executed. The same could be said of the Tesla vehicles. However, today it seems like simple practicality well-executed is hard to come by in most industries, and he deserves a lot of credit for putting his money and time on the line and staying the course.",1373923703

Most digital orders are reversible and physical orders take some time to process (packaging, shipping, etc).<p>However, with brick and mortar stores, 0-confirmations transactions are much more problematic for the business. The customer could be long gone with your product by the time you notice the double-spend. OTOH, the 10 minutes delay is also much more problematic for the customer with physical stores (imagine a customer having to wait for 10 minutes to buy a pack of gum).<p>One interesting solution for making zero-confirmations safer to accept is fidelity bonds [1], where you would &quot;sacrifice&quot; some Bitcoins from your address, a sort of &quot;safe deposit&quot; that you never get back. From that point on, until that address is seen to commit a double-spend, merchants can accept zero-confirmation payments from it knowing that attempting to double-spend would make the customer&#x27;s initial deposit invalidated. As long as the deposit is larger than the transaction amount, it&#x27;ll make double-spending unprofitable.<p>Edit: Another interesting aspect is that fidelity bonds can also be used to make other kinds of fraud unprofitable, not only double-spending. However, while its easy to determine when a user committed a double-spend attack (just show two signed transactions paying the same coins to two different places), its not that straight forward to prove other kinds of fraud.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Fidelity_bonds#Financial_Services"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Fidelity_bonds#Financial_Services</a>",1373923629

Absolutely. And, well, that&#x27;s the problem.<p>For example, when I see people use terms like &quot;patriarchy&quot; in earnest, I tend to grimace a bit. Not because I think they&#x27;re crazy radical idiots, but because I think they&#x27;re dangerously behind the times. The concept of unilateral patriarchy (i.e., a system in which most/all advantages based on gender accrue to men while most/all disadvantages based on gender accrue to women) is something like thirty years out of date at this point. We know now that the enemy is gender essentialism, which rigid, constrained roles and systemic advantages/disadvantages emerge from. We also know now that it&#x27;s not a unidirectional oppression -- the resulting roles have aspects which harm people of all genders, and give at least some advantages to people of all genders.<p>But for every one person who gets this there are a thousand, or more, who just read sites like Jezebel, or feminism-related tags on Tumblr/Facebook, and end up imbibing pop-feminism ideas that are woefully out of touch with what we now actually know about gender in our society. What&#x27;s worse, those ideas tend to <i>reinforce</i> essentialist gender roles rather than seek to overturn them.<p>The wage gap, currently being argued in the usual stupid way in another front-page thread, is actually a wonderful example of this. Research has shown, time and again, that much of the gap results from women being assigned, by society as a whole, a &quot;childbearer/caregiver&quot; role. And the consequences are clear. Women are more likely to work part-time, women who work full-time work fewer hours and less overtime, women actively seek out &quot;child-friendly&quot; workplaces, women start out with relative earning parity but it falls off a cliff once they have or start thinking about having children, a whole raft of stuff that adds up really really quickly.<p>A real solution to this would be to throw out the essentialism and the notion that child-rearing is &quot;women&#x27;s work&quot;. A real solution would seek to push women out of automatically assuming that bearing and raising children is a vitally important life goal, and would seek to push men out of automatically assuming their role doesn&#x27;t involve caring for kids. A real solution would question basic ideas about what a successful life looks like and throw out any and all assumptions about &quot;I am of <i>this</i> gender, therefore I should desire <i>that</i>&quot;<p>But pop feminism doesn&#x27;t do any of that. Instead it assumes that being a woman is mostly identical with wanting to have children and be their primary caregiver. So pop-feminist articles focus on how to &quot;have it all&quot;, how to &quot;balance&quot; raising two kids with working 80-hour weeks at a law firm or running your own business, and argue that the important thing is to provide things like on-site day-care and generous maternal-leave policies to ensure women can keep right on performing the same rigid role they&#x27;ve had imposed on them for centuries.<p>What&#x27;s more, we know these policies really don&#x27;t work. There are countries which have implemented them, and they still see drastic drop-offs of women&#x27;s lifetime earnings post-childbirth. What those policies do really well is make it easier to slide back into that role of &quot;raising children is what I&#x27;m <i>really</i> supposed to do with my life&quot;.<p>But rather than attack the real problem, and ask the real, really hard questions about gender roles and how to overturn them, most people who identify as &quot;feminist&quot; just forward and share and retweet the same old pop-feminism drivel. And if you believe there isn&#x27;t a relatively large group of people who identify that way and do exactly that, with relative ideological unity in terms of underlying assumptions, then I just don&#x27;t know what Internet you&#x27;re spending time on.",1373923517

It is very difficult to get precise data, for starters.\nI am simply sceptic about the &quot;everything is the same&quot; claim - in many cases, how many instances of women and men with the exact same job, qualification and work hours did they even find? For example they claim female software developers earn less on average, but in 13 years working as a software developer, I have encountered only very, very few female software developers. I am highly doubtful that it is even possible to create a meaningful statistic here.\nAnd there might be still more factors at work, such as willingness to relocate or preference for certain branches. If male software developers tend to work for car companies, banks or telcos and female software developers tend to work for ad agencies or create web sites for mom and pos&#x27;s grocery store (just made up, I have no idea), it could make a difference for example. But as I said, it is very difficult to get that kind of data.<p>In the media I have seen worse offenses, for example the claim that female teachers earn less than male teachers, without mentioning that there are different kinds of schools (more women tend to work at elementary schools vs men working at high schools) - most teachers get a fixed salary determined by the government, so gender discrimination is next to impossible (there certainly is no government rule that female teachers earn less than male teachers). Or physicians, without mentioning that there are different branches of medicine and surgeons might have a harder job than pediatricians.<p>What strikes me is that none of those wage gap studies ever seems to question why the wage gap exists. For example they could ask employers or even the employees themselves. It seems they just want to prove discrimination and stop once they have favorable data.",1373923351

An office building is not the place to raise an infant.  Not to be crude, but a well trained dog would be less intrusive and lower maintenance but <i>most</i> offices aren&#x27;t big on even those.  This becomes even more clear when you look at workplaces beyond professional office environments.  Expecting factories to allow mothers to carry their infants around in slings throughout the workday is unreasonable.  Those workplaces are not and cannot be designed with that in mind.<p>No, I think I agree with rayiner.  The real problem is that women are expected to raise their children in that peculiar way.  We have infrastructure and social constructs that allow mothers to remain professionals but now society is telling mothers that if they want to be <i>good</i> mothers then they cannot take advantage of those things.  &quot;Good&quot; mothers don&#x27;t take advantage of modern convenience but instead do it the prehistoric way that is fundamentally at odds with maintaining a career.  That is the problem.",1373922886

The grants go to thousands of municipalities all over the country and 10 million Pell Grant recipients. Also, the department oversees $150 billion in annual direct student loans to 13 million students every year. Figuring out who is eligible for grants, how much different programs should get, etc, is not a trivial task. Also, the Dept. of Ed.&#x27;s mandate is complicated by Title I and IDEA. The purpose of Title I is to combat racial discrimination in education among historically disadvantaged minorities, and the purpose of IDEA is to combat educational discrimination among the disabled. These are hairy and complicated problems to deal with (e.g. the Department is charged with dealing with the states, who look for every way possible to avoid providing services to minorities and the disabled).<p>The program management overhead of the Dept. of Ed. is about $1.8 billion: <a href=""http://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget12/summary/edlite-section4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget12/summary/ed...</a>. Out of that $1.8 billion, $1 billion goes to administering student loans and Pell Grants. Assuming that it costs about the same to administer a student loan versus a Pell Grant, we can estimate that maybe $450 million is spent administering Pell Grants. That reduces the overhead, excluding student loans (which aren&#x27;t included in the $65 billion discretionary budget) to $1.25 billion, or 1.9%.",1373922716

See the video of the founder using it: <a href=""http://blog.virtub.com/?p=15"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.virtub.com/?p=15</a><p>Seems to me the difference between ""web app"" and ""desktop app"" is getting more and more fuzzy. Is it a web app because it's written in Flash? Is it a web app because it (presumably) doesn't store anything on your machine?<p>Given that desktop apps these days often interact heavily with data from the web (Google Earth, for instance), what exactly is the definition of ""web app"" now?",1182131067

28768,comment,28410,28410,0,0,lupin_sansei,,,"I've never been that enthusiastic about OO but I've recently become a convert to a particular case. Perl's CGI::Application module makes your whole website a single class, and each page in that site is a method in the class. I believe web.py is similar in idea. So rather than a folder full of scripts for each page you just have a single script which contains the code for all the pages of the site.<p>Having your whole site as a single class is convenient firstly as your constructor can handle the code that's common to each page, though you don't necessarily need OO to do this. Where this OO approach really shines thought is that you can create a more general web site class such as an online shop, and then subclass it for a particular instance of a shop for a client.",1182129796

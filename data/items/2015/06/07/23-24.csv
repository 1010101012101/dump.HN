The quote implies that the colonizers found Africans to be more suited to fulfilling slave roles, and that the master-slave cycle formulated earlier is a genetic one. It doesn&#x27;t make a direct judgment whether the colonizers were correct. The jab at political correctness doesn&#x27;t seem to be an absolute refutation of opposing arguments, so much as an outlining of the historian&#x27;s fallacy of trying to apply contemporary moral value judgments to past circumstances.

Application design and development is not this black and white. SOA is not GOOD or BAD. It is a design structure that some people like, and some people seem to hate. There are good ways of doing things and bad ways of doing things. In my experience, having small manageable code bases that are responsible for one domain makes things so much easier to develop and maintain. But, that is my opinion not something I think is a universal truth. Architecture/Design/Implementation of any complex system is not an exact science with perfect formulas for creation. It would be nice to have more articles about new and exciting ways of doing things, instead of the same old tearing down of others for being stupid/wrong/etc because they think functional/OO/SOA/microservices/containers/etc is the wrong way to do things.",1433721352

Would it still be counter to progress to point this out? If you still think it would be immoral, how can you progress if you misdiagnose reality? I mean if you want to solve the problem, you have to know what causes it. If environment causes the problem, then environmental changes can fix it. If genes cause the problem, then we might have the technology in a few decades that allows parents to level-up their children. In the mean time, if genes are the issue, then universal basic income would be a lot better for disadvantaged then spending money on the school bureaucracy. So if you want to help people, you need to have a truthful view of the problem.<p>Follow-up question. If would be OK to hold the genetic view in world where the genetic hypothesis was actually true, how are we to know which world we actually live in, if people are not allowed to make good faith cases of the evidence and analysis for both viewpoints, without fear of ostracism and career suicide?",1433721311

9676755,comment,9675684,9676407,0,0,badsock,,,"If we do experience moderate to severe climate change, millions or even billions of humans will die in pain: through starvation or wars over resources.  I know people like to consider that sort of thing in the abstract, but the thought of that much suffering actually happening should be horrific to anyone.<p>So when people make the very important decision to take climate change seriously or not based on the shallow level of reasoning that you&#x27;ve used in your post, it scares the hell out of me.  For your first point: you could just as easily argue that someone doesn&#x27;t believe that poverty exists because they haven&#x27;t sold all of their belongings and given the money to the poor.  Some problems need very large political changes, and so it&#x27;s perfectly rational (though perhaps hypocritical) to not worry about personal behaviour when changing it would be just window dressing.<p>Your second argument boils down to &quot;scientists have been wrong in the past&quot;.  The fact that you&#x27;re willing to take humanity&#x27;s largest gamble on scientists being maybe wrong this time is irrational.  The downside risk is literally the collapse of human civilization, with violent or desperate deaths for most of us, and the upside is that we&#x27;d managed to not be duped into making investments into energy infrastructure and enriching a couple of charlatans?  Why would anyone take that bet?<p>Granted, we can&#x27;t be held hostage to every doomsayer that comes along, but the alarms that are being raised by scientists and researchers now is unprecedented.  Something large appears to be happening, and no one knows what will happen, but everything but the best case scenario is very, very bad.  If your post presents the best evidence you have, then you have practically no grounds for being as certain as you are that everything&#x27;s going to be fine.",1433721080

Instead, I&#x27;ll take the top hit off of google scholar, given the search term for &quot;Sapir Whorf&quot;[1]. The conclusion is in the abstract:<p><pre><code>    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    These findings suggest that the mastery of the English subjunctive is probably quite tangential to counterfactual reasoning in Chinese. In short, the present research yielded no support for the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n</code></pre>\nEvery serious study of S-W, results in the same: no evidence.<p>Now, there is -minute- evidence that languages that have very short number words allows students to master the memorization of number sequences easier---the students literally have less information (in terms of phonemes) to memorize. This sort of thing is actually pretty prevalent; but it is not really what most people are thinking of when they discuss S-W.<p>Also, the Himba &quot;study&quot; about green is pretty much debunked. If you get a high-quality monitor, with good ambient lighting, go ahead and ask some colleagues to find the differently-colored green square. They&#x27;ll do so, just fine, and quite quickly!<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010027783900380"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/00100277839...</a>",1433718159

There are several entries each year in &quot;Accidents in North American Mountaineering&quot; that describe failure to properly use a mechanical belay device. I recall no accidents as the result of a faulty autoblock knot. This knot is aligned with the KISS principle from software engineering.  It is remarkably simple and effective.<p>Interesting to read this story of its origin.",1433718145

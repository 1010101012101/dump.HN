When we started almost 10 years ago we only offered online invoicing.  Since then we have added things like the ability to track expenses and a profit & loss statement.  As a result our customers have started calling us cloud accounting, so we are changing the way we describe ourselves to reflect that, and to better signal what they can expect from us going forward.<p>I wrote a very long letter to our customers about this.  I encourage anyone interested in getting more clarity to please read it in its entirety.

I would sometimes go to the comments page and then the external link from there, just so the BACK action would take me to the comments page.<p>But this was not ideal for two reasons: 1, if I got to read the top comments first I'd probably already be biased by the time I got to check out the linked page (I guess that also says a lot about me); and 2, I don't always want to go through the comments page at all, but I can't really know this up front, without visiting the link first.<p>So, since I never got to make a Chrome extension before and because there's never a better time to experiment with new stuff than when you're avoiding 'real' work, I tried to create one to fix this. With only a few coding hours this evening, it already works great for me. Here's the flow:<p>- Install the Chrome extension (find link in github README)<p>- Click on any link from the HN listing normally<p>- If you decide to comment or read comments after visiting the linked page, press SHIFT+BACKSPACE and it will take you to the comments page on HN<p>- But wait, if you do BACK now, it takes you back to that page and you want to go to the HN listing instead. Do SHIFT+BACKSPACE again then<p>PS: Let me know if you also find this flow helpful or if you have ideas for different shortcuts.<p>PPS: I'm not tracking anything or doing anything malicious with your browser, but since it's my first extension, let me know if you see any fishy coding logic in there.",1345568355

4413554,comment,4413277,4413277,21,0,austenallred,,,"I come from a marketing background, and I have to say that sometimes the negative view of marketers is completely deserved. All it takes is some kid in business school to watch The Social Network and decide he needs a ""code monkey"" to build his awesome idea. He becomes the ""idea"" guy, tries to find someone to give 10% equity to build everything, and gets ready to snort cocaine in Palo Alto.<p>But if you've ever worked with a truly talented marketer, it's an incredible experience. The way they can take something, craft the messaging to it's JUST RIGHT and find the proper channels to market on - it's a beautiful thing. But for someone who doesn't come from a marketing background, it's very hard to discern.<p>I'm sure there are really bad hackers (or do we still call them ""hackers?""), but if you're a marketer it's hard to tell the difference.<p>Generally disrespect comes from a lack of willingness to understand what actually happens on the other side. I think it should be mandatory for every marketer to learn how to code - even if it's some basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Hackers should all have to try and acquire customers, and see that it's not all sending out a couple of tweets or emailing a TechCrunch columnist. Whether you consider the other side a ""code monkey"" or a ""non-technical idiot,"" you're in big trouble. It takes two hands to clap, and both are immensely difficult to accomplish.<p>You have to specialize, but you also have to understand.",1345568341

But if you are talking about different styles of coding then you have a lot of other things to consider. On top of this, if you have a language that has very few underlying primitive (such as parentheses in lisp as opposed to [,;.] in other languages) then you actually have a higher comprehension barrier as the reader will need have to examine the role of the primitive as well. Basically, the terser the language the harder it is comprehend a LOC in that language.<p>On the research note, I do agree that most SW engineering research has focused on 'small problems'.",1345568232

You'll rarely get called out in a meeting, but you'll get outmaneuvered or back-channeled after the meeting is over.<p>The field is incredibly political. When I worked in marketing, I felt like I was a character in ""Game of Thrones."" The constant alliances, shifts, backstabbings, feints, etc., were exhausting.

The hardware you could buy in 1998 basically didn't exist in 1996, so there always was something new and exciting to spur new hardware sales.<p>New hardware sales represent the bulk of Microsoft's Windows licensing (the so-called ""Microsoft Tax"") revenue and so a large part of MSFT's profits. All MS had to do was be the default OS and their profit would grow without lifting a finger (obviously that's greatly simplified, MS had to do a lot of things).<p>Now that this hardware revolution is no longer taking place, MS' Windows licensing rev (and thus the huge profits) are threatened. Competition in the PC market have driven hardware profits to zero. MS and their clone makers have painted themselves into a corner.<p>Contrast this with Apple's strategy - produce desirable hardware that people buy for non-technical reasons (design, fashion, software, etc.) instead of raw figures (CPU, Memory, etc.). Folks will upgrade because they <i>want</i> to, not because they <i>need</i> to. That's a lot harder to pull off, but Apple seems to be doing a great job of it.<p>Ultimately, I think Apple's strategy is going to make a lot more sense in the long run. Drive the cost of the operating system upgrades to zero (I'd be shocked if the next OSX upgrade costs anything; I was quite surprised that Mountain Lion was {edit: <i>not</i>} a fee upgrade), limit the age of device that can run it, and create products that people want.",1345567501

The only 'inherent' thing wasn't skill - it was an inability to not want to learn more about computers and programming.<p>It took sweat, and there's an entire category of people who believe in inherent genius versus really effing hard work.  That category of people will never put in the work necessary for others to inappropriately categorize them as inherent genius.  I hate this problem and don't know how to convince people when they've fallen into that trap :-\",1345566716

4413413,comment,4411997,4413322,3,0,pnathan,,,"This is both true and false. LoC is a volume metric. More volume = more things to comprehend.<p>A great example of imperative vs. less-imperative is looping vs mapping.<p>Mapping in Python:<p><pre><code>    foo = map(function, list)
</code></pre>
vs looping in C++:<p><pre><code>   for(int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++)
   {
        foo[i] = function(list[i];
   }
</code></pre>
Note that the C++ version has about 6 choice points where errors can be made (or customized too - it's more flexible than a map)- initialization, comparison, upper bound, increment, lval index, and the rval index. So to grasp the entirety of the loop, you have to examine all 6 things, whereas the map is far simpler.  After a while, this simplicity starts to add up.<p>However, LoC is a truly bad metric (other measures are, imo, just as bad), and doesn't really capture what I just said at <i>all</i>. What LoC does capture (as I said above) is volume - the extrinsic complexity of the solution.  If you can hone your code so that it simply expresses the intrinsic complexity of the solution, your LoC will decrease to that point.  And language helps a great deal.<p>Your point is really well made though: for industrial use you have to have a head to head of expert teams over a reasonable time frame for a reasonably sized system, in reasonably comparable conditions. And yeah, that's the big joke in SW engineering research. It's never really been done and published in any meaningful way. Some companies did do work in that area in the '80s, as I recall - but they didn't publish meaningful datasets as far as my reading shows. Most SW engineering research in this area is very much ""small problems"" and ""students in a class"".",1345566456

4413351,comment,4412612,4412612,4,0,lambda,,,"Hmm. I decided to take a look at the commercial licenses on Binpress, and this caught my eye:<p><pre><code>    2.4 Including the Right to Create Derivative Works: 
    Licensee may create derivative works based on 
    Software, including amending Softwares source 
    code, modifying it, integrating it into a larger 
    work or removing portions of Software, as long as 
    no distribution of the derivative works is made
</code></pre>
Now, a lot of the components on Binpress are things like Objective-C classes for use in iOS. But linking to such a class creates a derivative work, and it sounds like you are not then allowed to distribute your derivative work, which would make it rather useless.<p>Given section 2.1, it sounds like the license is intended to be used only for server-side code, not anything that will be distributed to end users.<p><pre><code>    2.1 Limited: Licensee may use Software for the purpose of:
      2.1.1 Running Software on Licensees Website[s] and Server[s];
      2.1.2 Allowing 3rd Parties to run Software on Licensees Website[s] and 
        Server[s];
      2.1.3 Publishing Softwares output to Licensee and 3rd Parties;
      2.1.4 Distribute verbatim copies of Softwares output (including compiled 
        binaries);
      2.1.5 Modify Software to suit Licensees needs and specifications.
</code></pre>
But a lot of these components are client side-components. There is either something wrong with their license, or something wrong with their curation, if they are trying to license client-side code with a license that seems to only make sense for server-side code.<p>There seem to be lots of other problems with the licensing, too; the license summaries will say things like ""Can be distributed in 5 projects"" but the actual license itself never mentions the number 5 at all (example: <a href=""http://www.binpress.com/license/read/id/1225/app/1063"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.binpress.com/license/read/id/1225/app/1063</a>). Or the ""developers license"" will say that it's ""Sublicensable"", but not define what that means or what restrictions there are.<p>Given that it seems that the core reason for Binpress to exist is to make it easy to commercially license small software components, the fact that the licenses make no sense does not make me feel very comfortable about using it.",1345565739

A programmer, in my opinion, must have some College exposure.  The OP does, as he says he graduated with a business degree.  Aside from that, programming is a multi-faceted and ever-evolving discipline.  We are always learning new things.  A proven ability to approach something new and learn it is at the top of my list.  He certainly proved that part.<p>I come to this from the perspective that virtually nothing I do today existed when I was in college.  This goes for programming languages and even hardware design areas such as FPGA's.  I, as an engineer, have to learn constantly.  That aspect of my profession never stopped and, in fact, intensified after leaving college as there's so much to learn.<p>How is a college grad going to react to a paradigm shift such as what happened as the internet started to take roots?  It was the wild west for several years as new ideas popped-up and you had to either play or get off the train.  I'll take someone really smart who has the tenacity, drive and interest to learn new things quickly over a degreed engineer who is slow to react.<p>I have known many engineers who have remained stagnant over the years because they simply didn't want to bother to learn new things or were far too comfortable doing what they were doing.  Some of these guys are unemployed today.  Their skill set simply doesn't match todays reality and a degree means exactly nothing.<p>Now, to be sure, the combination of good, solid schooling and drive, tenacity and a rabid interest to constantly learn can be a very powerful thing.  In my experience that person is more the exception than the rule.  A lot of college grads just want to find a train to ride as long as they can with the skill set they acquired.  The self-driven individual who wants to own a topic today and then another topic tomorrow is very rare.<p>Oh, yes, and a lot of college grads write code that is as shitty as anyone else's.

And absent a conspiracy, there's no profit in that.

4413291,comment,4407783,4408215,5,0,tptacek,,,"I know this sounds true, but I somewhat doubt that it is. Google, for instance, has a reputation for preferring candidates from top schools. But it is also hiring out of many of the subfields where the talent shortage is most acute. I'm pretty familiar with one of those (appsec), and my perspective is that Google is (a) absolutely not passing on people because of credentials, and (b) having as hard a time as anyone staffing.<p>Similarly: it is very hard for us to hire (in particular, it's very hard to fill the top of the recruiting funnel) --- and we could obviously give a shit where anyone went to school. Again: same prickly subfield. But I've got reason to believe this is true of mobile development, Rails, customer acquisition/marketing, and high-end UI as well.<p>I'm sure there are people who know Java and C++ and went to SIU instead of UIUC who are having a hard time, and that they'd have had an easier time if they went to a different school. But they'd also have an easier time if they watched the market and made sure to cultivate aptitude in the subfields with the most demand.",1345565052

Tablets and smartphones afford us completely new ways to interact with computers (and each other). Recent ones, such as the Nexus 7, are reasonably priced to boot. There are some perhaps unavoidable consequences of replacing whole devices rather than individual components (environmental, to say the least), but in the abstract I think it's hard to say whether one model is necessarily worse than the other.",1345564915

That the car ""contains several operating systems in itself"" isn't especially meaningful, because operating systems are not fungible.  The ""OS"" controlling your ABS system (for example) is going to be as simple as possible.  Windows on the other hand is aiming for as general as possible.<p>Second, you do have licensing agreements with your car.  You have warranties that become void if you do X or Y, if you fail to properly maintain Q or R, etc.  And those various OSes in the car are not sold to you any more than Windows is.  They are licensed, under what specific terms I don't really know.",1345564836

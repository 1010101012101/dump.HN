7888846,comment,7886266,7887835,1,0,parasubvert,,,"This.<p>The above said, the learning algorithm has flaws that can make Pareto optimality impossible (economists call this market failure).  This is where we inject aspects of central planning into the modern economy, with debatable results.<p>For example, it presumes a level of information symmetry through the price mechanism.  Markets begin to fail when people don&#x27;t/can&#x27;t understand what they&#x27;re buying - the &quot;market for lemons&quot;.  This is why we have an SEC and mandatory , standardized, information filing for publicly traded companies for example.<p>Another is high levels of uncertainty about the sudden need to buy something, which is so expensive it can wipe you out - eg. Major surgery.  Insurance markets cover this.  But we all have observed the debates and challenges of managing a sizeable and representative risk pool.<p>Intellectual property and digitized products (music, movies, TV shows, software) also has a fascinating role here in that it is a public good that is open to free ridership unless (a) the good is a secret and is accessed only as a service or (b) the government enforces a temporary monopoly on an aspect of the product.  The latter may be past its prime given the abuse of patents and copyrights leading to non-Pareto outcomes.",1402667907

If it&#x27;s the latter it seems likely to be much <i>less</i> comfortable than a bus, where there&#x27;s usually a potential to move around a bit and you go into it expecting to make intermediate stops (and knowing where/when they are!).<p>- After taking plenty of effort to get the dollars right you gloss over the most important issue: routefinding.  Mentioning some hypothetical &quot;similar trip&quot; is not all that meaningful.  If you live near one stop and work near another on the same line it might be much faster to take transit.  If you live in a world built primarily for cars with no regard for other modes, you may find it difficult to find <i>any</i> public transit option for your route.<p>- And a shift in traffic is laudable only if it doesn&#x27;t serve to induce further demand [0].<p>[0]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand</a>",1402667732

7888828,comment,7887852,7888322,4,0,mattgreenrocks,,,"But the complexity that emerges is <i>not</i> from supporting multiple devices! It comes from retrofitting everything atop a model originally designed for navigating a graph of linked documents. This is a severe deficiency in the original design, and no framework can patch it over. As developers, we&#x27;re the ones left holding the pieces to an abortion of design day after day. This state of affairs is unacceptable.<p>I remember when Swing was big. Everyone was gushing about it despite obvious flaws: non-native UI, poor startup time, horrible accessibility, and ridiculous memory consumption. Industry <i>loves</i> the idea of one platform-to-rule-them-all, no matter how far behind the uber-platform is. It would rather dump endless amounts of money and time into a patchwork of hacks than admit that it was wrong.<p>We&#x27;re way past due for a VM for webapps.

7888776,comment,7886014,7887766,32,0,rayiner,,,"Disclaimer: I think civil forfeiture laws are applied without sufficient discretion in drug cases. And it&#x27;s troubling that they apply not just to illegally-obtained assets, but those that are &quot;instrumentality of a crime.&quot; That said, there&#x27;s an important wrinkle here that you&#x27;re glossing over, and that is usually glossed over in discussions about civil forfeiture.<p>Civil forfeiture is not confiscation of your property as <i>punishment</i> for committing a crime. It&#x27;s a determination that the property was never yours to begin with, because it was obtained in an illegal transaction.[1] That&#x27;s why the standard for civil forfeiture isn&#x27;t whether the person is guilty &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; but rather whether the property is the fruits of a crime by the &quot;preponderance of the evidence.&quot; Any civil dispute over the rightful ownership of property is evaluated according to a preponderance of the evidence standard, and the dispute about the status of the property can be resolved without resolving the issue of criminal guilt.<p>The very important distinction to make here is that the issue of whether Ulbricht is guilty is distinct from whether the money is the proceeds of illegal activity. Maybe Ulbricht gets acquitted because he creates enough reasonable doubt that he isn&#x27;t DPR, as he claims. Or because he succeeds in getting key evidence excluded because of a procedural failure by the feds. His acquittal doesn&#x27;t mean that the money wasn&#x27;t the product of illegal activity. Indeed, he has tremendous incentive to try and prove that he never owned these Bitcoins, because that goes to proving he isn&#x27;t DPR!<p>[1] At least when we&#x27;re talking about cash. There&#x27;s a whole host of more questionable issues when it comes to things like forfeiture of vehicles and guns used in crimes.

Government serves a purpose in maintaining the framework of items you listed.  We also agree that the corrupt ruling class combination of the Government and Capitalists (along with way too much of the media these days, I&#x27;d add) is a disaster.<p>Where I&#x27;d imagine that we differ is that I think that the pendulum has swung way too far in the direction of the State.  With a debt that is now bigger than our GDP and the last hundred years of mostly one-way growth of government and its agencies, the Government is a huge black hole for money that encourages, institutionalizes, and legalizes ever-increasing degrees of corruption.<p>The best way forward that I see is to cut back the size and scope of Government.  Get it back to doing the basics that it was commissioned to do (The Constitution) and not much else unless there&#x27;s enough impetus for those functions that would drive Constitutional Amendments.  If the incentive to sway law-making power would be reduced, much of the cronyism that exists today would disappear.  The ruling class would be significantly diminished.<p>Sure, Wal Mart might have more economic power, but its lobbying and legislative power would be drastically reduced.  At the end of the day, I have a choice to shop at Wal Mart or to not shop at Wal Mart.  I don&#x27;t have a choice regarding paying taxes to feed the behemoth of a Government that does not provide expected reasonable value for those taxes... not to mention the negatives of crippling public education, moving to a lowest-common-denominator-but-still-expensive healthcare system, etc.",1402666258

Sometimes you have different types of failures to handle and this style conflates all of them into &quot;failure&quot;.&quot;<p>No, it doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not sure where you get that, because even in this example &quot;Failure&quot; carries an error message. That&#x27;s a string for didactic purposes, it can be anything you need it to be.<p>&quot;2. There are different way to fail. There are cases in which you really should not go on with any computation, there are cases in which can go on, just note that you are in &quot;danger&quot; mode (ENOSPC).&quot;<p>Here is where avoiding the word &quot;monad&quot; probably does not play to the author&#x27;s favor.

Whatever you want to do, you can do, because it&#x27;s just a program like anything else. For 3, the answer is &quot;just write it the way you want it&quot;... there isn&#x27;t really an &quot;answer&quot; because that&#x27;s not a problem in the first place, any more than it would be in C.

So I always go back to a simpler text editor that I&#x27;ve been using for 15+ years and does everything I need very well without the sluggishness of a feature-rich IDE.<p>For example, every time I open a PyCharm project I get an alert I need to dismiss that managing files will be slow because they&#x27;re on a network drive.

I&#x27;m confident we do a good job giving people options - the most important way is that I encourage people to make a habit of only spending 6-8 hours in the office a day, and if you want to work more than that, do it from home/coffee shop. That way, you&#x27;re not sitting around feeling pressured to keep working when really you&#x27;re done for the day. The founders obviously basically work all day, so we&#x27;re always available, but I think it alleviates the pressure that I see felt at offices where everyone seems to stay late as a habit.",1402664784

When joining HN, I was extremely impressed with the don't be a jerk mantra that was an overarching theme. Many of the other sites that I had been contributing to had devolved into a typical technical arrogance contents. Upon see a community of technical people that treated each other with respect (a rarity), I decided that not only would I like to be associated with the group, but that I would resolve to help any member in any way possible. Mentoring is part of that. I have to say, I have helped 3 people who where looking for mentorship on this site and all of them have been pleasant experiences.  Some of them I did not see the value in what they where working on (that means nothing we all don't get why something went big at some point) but I did see the passion and even though I did not see the usefulness of there vision when applied to my life, it does not mean that I could not offer advice in other areas that I had run into similar pain point in my start-ups. For the individuals that I helped mentor on a pure ""learning programming"" basis from this site they where all pleasant, greatfull and considerate of my time. I am glad that I did each and every one of them, as I believe not only did it help them progress but it help me as well.

1997533,comment,1997341,1997341,0,0,samstokes,,,"Monads are <i>red herrings</i>, if what you're interested in is getting started with functional programming (or even Haskell specifically).  It's an unfortunate flaw in the Haskell literature that makes it seem like you have to grok monads to learn Haskell; you don't.<p>Monads <i>enable syntactic sugar</i>.  If you're getting started with Haskell, you'll notice that when you write code that does I/O, you use a weird imperative-looking syntax (""do notation"") that looks different to the normal functional style:<p><pre><code>    main :: IO ()\n    main = do\n      putStrLn ""Please enter your name""\n      name <- getLine\n      putStrLn (""Hello "" ++ name ++ ""!"")\n</code></pre>\n'putStrLn ""Hello""' doesn't actually print anything; it returns an IO value that, when interpreted by the Haskell runtime, prints something: that interpretation takes place when 'main' is run.  The do notation is syntactic sugar for creating a sort of compound IO value that interprets as a bunch of actions rather than just one.  The reason you can use do notation for IO but not for (all) other Haskell code is that IO values are monadic (which is another and possibly more useful way of saying ""IO is a monad""): that just means that they behave in a certain way when combined (to produce that compound value) and obey certain laws to make the do notation well behaved.<p>Monads are <i>a design pattern</i> to abstract away repetitive functional code.  For example, if you write a lot of pure-functional code you sometimes end up having to pass around a 'state' parameter.  If a function reads or writes from the state, then any function that calls it has to pass in the state, and so on.  This leads to a lot of functions with an extra state parameter, many of which don't even care about the state except to pass it down the call tree.  An improvement would be to write a higher-order function which took a function which didn't care about state and wrapped it to produce one that just passed the state through.  The State monad encapsulates this wrapping and lets you clean up the rest of your code.<p>Monads are <i>what's between the lines</i> of an imperative program.  Bourne shell scripts have the default error-handling rule that they ignore failing commands unless it's the last one executed, or put another way, they run in a monad that ignores errors:<p><pre><code>    cat nonexistent.txt   # prints an error message\n    echo Done.            # still executes, prints ""Done.""\n    # script returns success\n</code></pre>\nBut you can tell it to run instead in a monad which stops after the first error:<p><pre><code>    set -e                # change the monad, i.e. the error-handling rule\n    cat nonexistent.txt   # prints an error message\n    echo Done.            # never runs\n    # script returns failure\n</code></pre>\nOld-school Visual Basic has the opposite default, but you can make it behave like a shell script with ""ON ERROR RESUME NEXT"".  Yes, VB had monads.<p>Monads are <i>a specific example of higher-kinded polymorphism</i>, which is a very powerful and useful concept that's starting to enter the programming mainstream (examples are template concepts in C++ and LINQ in C# and .NET).  Parametric polymorphism (List<String> in Java and C#, etc) means you don't have to write a 'reverse' function that works on lists of strings, and another 'reverse' function for lists of ints, etc; you can just write a generic reverse function that works on lists of any kind, because it doesn't need to know the details of the contained type, just how to iterate over a list.  However, if you want to reverse an <i>array</i>, you still have to write a new 'reverse'.  If your language supports higher-kinded polymorphism, you can write a generic reverse function that works on any kind of container, because all it needs to know is that the container has some well-behaved method of iteration.<p>(The LINQ example is a bit more subtle, because C# <i>doesn't</i> support higher-kinded polymorphism, but LINQ is a hard-coded exception to that rule.  The cool LINQ syntax works for any type which provides certain operations and behaves in a certain way - which just happen to coincide with the requirements for the type to be monadic.)",1292178089

That way, scientists were able to construct a genome-wide genetic map of the foetus, which they could then scan for variations and mutations.""<p>Now I'm interested to read more. The article can be found behind the following paywall: <a href=""http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/2/61/61ra91.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/2/61/61ra91.abstract</a> .<p><i>Update</i>: OK, I was a bit confused by the DNA extraction process. From what I can tell, they only took DNA from the parents once, at ~12 weeks gestation. They then GWASsed them and found sites where the fetus would be an <i>obligate heterozygote</i> because the mother was homozygous for one allele while the father was homozygous for another. (So if mom is AA and dad is GG, the fetus must be AG, assuming no point mutation occurs there.)<p>But if the blood is only drawn once, 10% of the maternal DNA will be fetal DNA, so how are they confidently calling sites as homozygous in the mother? I suppose this makes sense if Birdseed is robust to 5% error in the data, and if so this is quite clever. (5% because 10% of the DNA is fetal, and at the obligate het sites half of that 10% will be maternal so only 5% total will be of paternal origin.)<p>Now, their method is for high-depth whole-genome sequencing, which is still very expensive, but there's no reason they couldn't use targeted sequencing with this approach (they address this in the discussion). That would allow for a potentially inexpensive test for inherited genetic disorders without invading the fetal privileged space (which is what we currently do, and which is high-risk).",1292177994

Rather than telling you what a monad is, I'll just tell you the goal.<p>OO is designed to hide the dangerous parts of the world from you. The dangerous parts of the world (or at least <i>some</i> dangerous parts of the world) are encapsulated inside little black boxes with well defined interaction points. If you interact only through those little boxes, you should be safe. For instance, a logger object gives you 1 methods: writeLog (I'll ignore logging levels). The details of actually writing logs are not your business, and you (in principle) don't need to worry about them.<p>Monads are stricter. A monad puts you into a box and only gives you a few interaction points with the outside world. You can do whatever you want in a monad, but you are never allowed to leave the box. Inside the logger box, you are permitted only pure functions (functions with no side effects) and writeLog.<p>So basically, in an OO world, code using a logger might call os.unlink(""/var/log/myprogram.log"").

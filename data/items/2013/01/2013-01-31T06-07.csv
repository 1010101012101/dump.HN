It was very annoying recently to find that <i>none</i> of the popular weather services I wanted to check during the recent cold spell here in the UK were fully accessible from my iPad, because they <i>all</i> used Flash for their interactive maps.

And of course in Java's case, you can write an applet in several modern JVM-hosted languages that are vastly superior to Javascript for implementing non-trivial visualisations, and with much faster performance than even the best current Javascript engines.<p>Give up plug-ins and use HTML5 and Javascript.

Chinese people are concerned about money first and foremost followed by their family.<p>Also I'd like to challenge the implied perspective that somehow American democracy is somehow superior. In fact the very notion of fighting for a political cause is a Western idea, Chinese people are less naive than Americans in a sense because everyone in China knows that the nightly newscast (Xinwen Lianbo) is all BS whereas people in America listen and cling onto their political religion (Rachael Maddow/Amy Goodman/Colbert Report for Left Coast Yuppies, Glenn Beck for Tea Partiers and CNN for mainstream suburbanites).<p>The Chinese idea is that politics has really less to do with personal life as they are the waves of a ocean to a surfer; they come and go, rather than try to bend the all-powerful, insurmountable, it's best to yield to the ocean, surf in its direction. People humbly refer themselves as One of the Hundred Names (Lao Bai Xin), separate from the emperors or now CPC in their celestial palace.<p>Not fighting for one's identity and civil representation may seem apathetic and offensive to American sensibilities. But for the Chinese, one would rather improve one's lot by focusing on getting into a better school, a good employer and finding a good partner for marriage and taking care parents than getting a piece of legislation changed <i>advertising</i> that you could <i>potentially</i> live a better life.<p>I'm sure supporters of American-style democracy will point to the civil rights movement, the New Deal, child labor laws as democracy-in-action that changed working class people's lives for the better if people stick together and march onto Washington. But the Chinese perspective sees revolutions and protests as natural occurrences of the masses dissatisfaction, like waves in an ocean, they will form when the conditions are right (mass protests on polluting factories, mass Weibo posts on air quality and expose on certain official's corruption). Even Tianmen incident was a protest made by the falling dominoes of communism and a mass of disaffected students and workers with varying and complex mix of agenda's - and to compare with the Westerner's idea of a rallying cry (Sandy Hook, Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, Rosa Parks) with a singular hero or matyr, it's a contrast of Taoist Wu-Wei and Confucian idea of communal harmony to American individualism and manifest destiny.",1359614889

  They are intelligent 20-somethings who seem harmless.
  But they are hard-core hackers who claim to have gained
  access to the world's most sensitive sites, including 
  the Pentagon.

  In fact, they say they are sometimes paid secretly by the
  Chinese government -- a claim the Beijing government
  denies.

  ""No Web site is one hundred percent safe. There are Web
  sites with high-level security, but there is always a
  weakness,"" says Xiao Chen, the leader of this group.

  ""Xiao Chen"" is his online name. Along with his two
  colleagues, he does not want to reveal his true identity.
  The three belong to what some Western experts say is a
  civilian cyber militia in China, launching attacks on
  government and private Web sites around the world.

  If there is a profile of a cyber hacker, these three are   
  straight from central casting -- young and thin, with skin
  pale from spending too many long nights in front of a
  computer.

  One hacker says he is a former computer operator in the
  People's Liberation Army; another is a marketing graduate;
  and Xiao Chen says he is a self-taught programmer.

  ""First, you must know about the Web site you want to
  attack. You must know what program it is written with,""
  says Xiao Chen. ""There is a saying, 'Know about both
  yourself and the enemy, and you will be invincible.'""

  CNN decided to withhold the address of these hackers' Web
  site, but Xiao Chen says it has been operating for more
  than three years, with 10,000 registered users. The site
  offers tools, articles, news and flash tutorials about
  hacking.

  Private computer experts in the United States from
  iDefense Security Intelligence, which provides
  cybersecurity advice to governments and Fortune 500
  companies, say the group's site ""appears to be an
  important site in the broader Chinese hacking community.""

  Arranging a meeting with the hackers took weeks of on-
  again, off-again e-mail exchanges. When they finally
  agreed, CNN was told to meet them on the island of
  Zhoushan, just south of Shanghai and a major port for
  China's navy.

  The apartment has cement floors and almost no furniture.
  What they do have are three of the latest computers. They 
  are cautious when it comes to naming the Web sites they
  have hacked.

  On camera, Xiao Chen denies knowing anyone who has
  targetted U.S. government Web sites. But off-camera, in
  conversations over three days, he claims two of his
  colleagues -- not the ones with him in the room -- hacked
  into the Pentagon and downloaded information, although he
  wouldn't specify what was gleaned. CNN has no way to
  confirm if his claim is true.

  ""They would not publicize this,"" he says of someone who
  hacks the U.S. Defense Department. ""It is very sensitive.""

  This week, the Pentagon said computer networks in the
  United States, Germany, Britain and France were hit last
  year by what they call ""multiple intrusions,"" many of them
  originating from China.

  At a congressional hearing in Washington last week,
  administration officials testified that the government's 
  cyber initiative has fallen far short of what is required.
  Most alarming, the officials said, there has never been a
  full damage assessment of federal agency networks.

  ""We are here today because we must do more,"" said Robert
  Jamison, a top official in the U.S. Department of Homeland
  Security. ""Defending the federal system in its current
  configuration is a significant challenge.""

  U.S. officials have been cautious not to directly accuse
  the Chinese military or its government of hacking into its
  network.

  But David Sedney, the deputy assistant secretary of
  defense for East Asia, says, ""The way these intrusions are
  conducted are certainly consistent with what you would
  need if you were going to actually carry out cyber
  warfare.""

  Beijing hit back at that, denying such an allegation and   
  calling on the United States to provide proof. ""If they
  have any evidence, I hope they would provide it. Then, we
  can cooperate on this issue,"" Qin Gang, a spokesman for
  the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said during a regular press
  briefing this week.

  But again off-camera, Xiao Chen says after the alleged
  Pentagon attack, his colleagues were paid by the Chinese
  government. CNN has no way to independently confirm if
  that is true.

  His allegations brought strenuous denials from Beijing. ""I
  am telling you honestly, the Chinese government does not
  do such a thing,"" Qin said.

  But if Xiao Chen is telling the truth, it appears his
  colleagues launched a freelance attack -- not initiated by
  Beijing, but paid for after the fact. ""These hacker groups
  in my opinion are not agents of the Chinese state,"" says
  James Mulvenon from the Center for Intelligence Research
  and Analysis, which works with the U.S. intelligence
  community.

  ""They are sort of useful idiots for the Beijing regime.""

  He adds, ""These young hackers are tolerated by the regime
  provided that they do not conduct attacks inside of
  China.""

  One of the biggest problems experts say is trying to prove
  where a cyber attack originates from, and that they say
  allows hackers like Xiao Chen to operate in a virtual
  world of deniability.

  And across China, there could be thousands just like him,
  all trying to prove themselves against some of the most
  secure Web sites in the world.

5143761,comment,5143439,5143688,5,0,ryanmolden,,,"I think our culture (well, American, capitalist society is all I can really comment on) has a very strong implied link between income and worth/value. We have magazines that routinely have lists of the highest paid / richest people. People give incredible leeway to highly paid execs, as if due to the number of zeros on their paycheck they clearly have to be right/smart. There are sayings like ""that decision was made above my paygrade"", that seem to show there is a pretty tight linkage, mentally, between income and value as a human.<p>I don't agree with this mindset at all, mainly because I don't believe most organizations are truly meritocratic in any objective sense. It's a good PR story, but people, evolutionarily, tend to ""look out for their own"", for whatever traits puts someone in that in-group. I have seen many examples of people espousing meritocracy but clearly considering those with the most ""merit"" as being one in the same with ""those they already seem to like"", coincidentally enough. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, with balance. I think a 100% meritocratic org would be lacking in basic humanity and kind of a terrible place to work. All humans make mistakes, have struggles, have setbacks, etc...<p>Even with that being said, and me not believing in the income -> value/worth link in general, I would not be comfortable talking about my salary with most friends/family. I live a comfortable life with little stress about money, but bragging about that (which even trying to downplay it sounds like a humblebrag) seems wrong somehow.",1359612639

Even then, unless the work impacts the external connection, the only copy of the certificate resides with the home owner.  I imagine an awful lot of people file it under the sofa, or in the garbage bin.  As far as I know, there is no central record of a house's wiring configuration.

Since with column-oriented DBMS its all about IO performance (Disk/Memory, Memory/CPU) such overhead can diminish the advantage.<p>Thus typical column stores tend to use only single strings of sequential memory to store the data.

Encrypted data?<p>The issue with file lockers is this: The service that actually hosts the file doesn't know what it is. It would be totally impractical for e.g. YouTube to preemptively screen all uploads for infringement by hand. It's just not economically possible.<p>So YouTube has a lot of infringing stuff on it. They also have a screening system which does fingerprinting etc., which keeps a lot of infringing stuff off (and also keeps plenty of non-infringing stuff off when there are false positives.)<p>But you can't even do that when your service is general purpose rather than specific to video. You don't know what a password-protected RAR archive has in it, you can't fingerprint it. So there is a ton more infringing stuff on the general purpose sites. The file locker takes it down as soon as the copyright holders identify it, but then the infringers just upload it again in ten minutes.<p>So you say, go after the uploaders. Okay, they're in non-extradition countries or are using anonymizers. Now what?<p>There are two fundamental facts that make stopping copyright infringement extraordinarily difficult: First, sending bits is very, very much cheaper than identifying what they represent and whether it's infringing. Second, normal law-abiding people have a legitimate interest in the privacy of their communications. In other words, good people need the same encryption that bad people abuse, and even if they didn't, there is too much volume to economically sort it by hand anyway, and the algorithmic methods are unreasonably inaccurate.

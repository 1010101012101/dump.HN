8235698,comment,8235120,8235120,5,0,userbinator,,,"ARM and x86 are rather close, but the real disappointment here is the MIPS Loongson, which is basically the &quot;original RISC ISA&quot;. Unfortunately I&#x27;ve encountered a huge number of people, particularly academics, who still think (and teach) that MIPS or minor variants of it are the &quot;best&quot; ISAs and that one can easily make cheap, fast, and power-efficient processors based on it. Looking at the current state of things, it seems the only thing MIPS has succeeded in is being cheap and pedagogical.<p>I think instruction density has quite some significance here too - x86 opcodes vary between 1 and 15 bytes with 2-3 being average and ARM has Thumb mode where instructions are either 2 or 4 bytes, but <i>all</i> MIPS instructions are 4 bytes. It also has twice as much L1 as most of the ARM and x86 processors, which apparently didn&#x27;t help it much. Cache consumes power too, and thus I believe small variable-length encodings (like x86) are ultimately better since they allow for better utilisation of cache; the extra complexity in the decoder to handle this, which basically amounts to a few barrel shifters, is almost nothing in comparison to the area and power that more cache would need.<p><i>The entire reason CISC architectures emphasized complex multi-cycle instruction execution is because memory accesses were orders of magnitude slower than the processor and data storage was extremely limited.</i><p>When considering cache, these points are all true again. There&#x27;s a common belief about optimising for x86 to avoid the smaller but slower &quot;CISC&quot; instructions, but in situations like tight loops, an instruction that&#x27;s 2-3x slower individually can be better than the faster longer one(s) if it means the difference between code and data staying in cache or a 10x+ slowdown from a cache miss somewhere else. Especially on an OoO/superscalar design where the slower instruction can be executed in parallel with other nondependent ones. (Intel/AMD&#x27;s focus on speeding up these small CISC instructions - which they have done - is possibly one of the reasons why x86 performance continues to improve.)",1409193868

The current block latency of the Bitcoin network is in the order of a number of seconds. As we know that current mining pools are indicative of the best connected (many of them have private peering and significant numbers of edge router nodes), we can assume that the majority of the network will be even poorer than this. In some testing the difference between a Stratum socket on the top 4 pools announcing a block was often up to 3 seconds.<p>For a 12 second block time in Bitcoin, the network would likely collapse down to just the biggest pool, as everybody else would have a disproportionately high number of orphan blocks. Sensible miners would need to move to the biggest pool in order to avoid a significant double-digit percentage losses.<p>> I thought the risk of a split chain was tied mostly to the wall clock, not the block count?<p>This is a correct statement to make. The number of blocks considered to be safe is completely irrelevant, and only has the effect of denoting the time on the wall. An hour for 6 confirmations in Bitcoin wasn&#x27;t chosen so much because it was 6 blocks long, but because it is a reasonable tradeoff between convenience and security. If the block time had been 5 minutes you would need 12 to get the same level of confidence in a transaction. I don&#x27;t understand why the Ethereum developers appear to think otherwise.",1409193107

8235605,comment,8235016,8235576,5,0,jacquesm,,,"With the amount of slop and the kind of drive used (steppers) going out of spec is the norm, precision is mostly coincidential.<p>If you don&#x27;t use servos or steppers+encoders for feedback you may just as well assume that anything that you produce is unique. The variability in wire-feed (gripping wire is a tricky proposition) and head temperature adds to this. The result is a fairly rough surface (compared to millwork or lathework) but in the end what matters most here is that it can be done at all.<p>If you require precision then you&#x27;re probably going to have to do a little bit of re-work (just like you would with casting), if all you care about is looks then you may have to do some sanding to get a really smooth surface.<p>3D printing right now does not allow fabrication to the same tolerances that we have gotten used to with even minimal metal working tools unless you are prepared to reach very deep into your pockets.<p>See above about renting, good quality equipment can be rented for a fraction of the cost of buying bad quality equipment and will produce workpieces that are very good due to the tight control over the head position and the increased control over wire feeds and temperatures.<p>Consistency (feeds, speeds, temperatures, materials) and precision (accuracy of position, repeatability) are flip sides of the same coin, you can&#x27;t really have the one without the other, and when both are good then you will have good quality workpieces. If either is not so good then you will end up with rough work, low quality and/or a lack of precision.<p>Not all work requires precision or good surface finish, it is rare to have work that requires neither.",1409191467

The main selling points for a solution in this area, for us, are:<p>(1) a strong remote registry implementation (available hooks, preferably auto-matched to auto-detected languages present, perhaps using <i>file</i>/<i>libmagic</i> and language syntax versioning); and<p>(2) the ability to spec default behavior remotely in a company-wide registry, but then to override at two levels: that of checked in files within the repo, and <i>.gitignore</i>&#x27;d local developer-specific prefs.<p>I&#x27;m definitely going to look at this further. To speed adoption, I&#x27;d encourage you to avoid assumptions around people&#x27;s de-facto desire for all but the most basic levels of linting (iffy warnings, etc.), ie. make sure the defaults are very light touch ... but useful. Convenience is key.<p>However, <i>please</i> don&#x27;t encourage <i>curl</i>-based installs!",1409191459

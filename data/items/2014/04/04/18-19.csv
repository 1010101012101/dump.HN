7533424,comment,7532270,7532394,1,0,zyxley,,,"Some assorted nitpicks:<p>Why is the box with &quot;Annual Savings&quot; and &quot;Average Monthly Price&quot; at the lower left where it&#x27;s obscuring the content instead of at the lower right where there&#x27;s a bunch of empty space?<p>The text for individual items feels small, low-contrast, and &quot;fuzzy&quot; to me - my eyes glaze right over it. I&#x27;d personally increase the size by 2pt, change it to black (or a Bootstrappian near-black), and include the product&#x27;s brand underneath the name in the current grey color (not important to me, but some people will care).<p>The emphasis on &quot;annual savings&quot; and the big &quot;refer and get $10&quot; are too big and emphasized and make me feel like the site is assuming I&#x27;m a cheapskate. It detracts somewhat from the convenience reason for the service when the site is shouting at me about the money saved instead (and if I was looking for absolute savings I already have money put in to Amazon Prime shipping). The Average Monthly Price number, on the other hand, is extremely useful, since trying to figure out that kind of thing is the biggest cognitive load for me for these sorts of services.<p>The thing at the lower left, the More Products button, the plus and minus buttons on products, and the buttons at the top are all way too emphasized and distracting as compared to the actual important stuff on the page at a first glance (the products queued up, the total pricing, and the ship date for each batch). The mouseover color change per month is also distracting, but I think it could maybe be a nice touch if it was tuned way down.<p>What&#x27;s with the Fisher-Price green and blue that don&#x27;t actually map to any particular sorts of actions? Green is to increment/decrement but also for the Help and date buttons, and blue is used for two buttons, a menu (but for some reason the email address, which I presume is an account name, isn&#x27;t a menu), and an infobox that&#x27;s not clickable at all, none of which have anything to do with each other.<p>I have no idea how any of the products in the list correspond with each other - are they recurring? I don&#x27;t know. It looks like when first added it adds a matching one to each second month in the future, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any other data linkage, so if I want to adjust numbers I have to manually go down the list and change it for each instance? There&#x27;s also no way to add anything for future months except by adding a product to the current month and then dragging it forward, and then manually clearing out or moving around all the ones automatically added to future months.<p>All-in-all, it feels more hassleworthy than Amazon, because this UI is relatively complicated and means a lot more brainwork to process and monitor than having &quot;send me this item every X weeks/months&quot;. I think for this to win out, it would need to be at least that convenient, and handle anything unusual by having a list of exceptions (e.g. &quot;send me one extra item Q in July&quot;) instead of having a full shopping list for every shipment to babysit.",1396636792

Things I liked:<p>You get an IDE for free. It&#x27;s quite usable out of the box and it&#x27;s really nice for learning the language.<p>It&#x27;s less reliant on punctuation. There are a few special symbols and they are highly regular in their usage. Syntax feels more readable (to me) than that of bash thanks to this.<p>You deal with objects. You can reflect on them (great for exploration), call methods on them, while still having generic ways for composing them and manipulating in large quantities. Yet the language itself is <i>not</i> object oriented, which makes it much simpler than it would be otherwise.<p>You get the whole .NET to use. Or most of it. You can basically instantiate and use any .NET class (and COM objects and other such things) without hassle.<p>There are a few concepts in the language which unify many concepts from the system. For example you can &quot;cd&quot; into a directory or a key in the registry or a network share or any number of other things which can be thought of as a listable resource.<p>This is coming from a programmer, so it&#x27;s missing things probably important for sysadmins, like security management and built in process of signing and verifying scripts signatures before running them.<p>One think I didn&#x27;t like: it was slow. The other: nothing worked on it (I mean things like python&#x27;s virtualenv, which comes with .bat file, but not with .ps1 file), even Visual Studio command prompt. I ended up writing some PowerShell code for translating cmd.exe variables to PS ones.<p>And, of course, it&#x27;s Microsoft, so forget about running it somewhere else.

7533283,comment,7530288,7532840,11,0,anigbrowl,,,"You don&#x27;t have to say much. For example, my wife will ask &#x27;is there anything I can do?&#x27; when I&#x27;m having a particularly bad time, and while the answer is often just &#x27;no,&#x27; her asking the question that way acknowledges the fact that I&#x27;m struggling without putting me under pressure to come up with an answer. For me the most important thing is knowing that someone is available without feeling that they&#x27;re waiting on me.<p>Chronic depression is a bit like an old AM radio; you can mitigate the lousy signal with the tuning knob and moving the antenna around, but you can&#x27;t fix it and call it done; the station that&#x27;s clearly tuned in today might stay clear tomorrow or be mired in static. As a patient, one can learn to separate oneself from one&#x27;s mood, so that feeling miserable doesn&#x27;t have to be attributed to an objective exterior cause. But learning that takes time, and inability to distinguish between one&#x27;s emotional and the quality of one&#x27;s environment was a major problem for me when I was younger.<p>The most helpful thing you can do is be around to listen and allow the depressed person to vent without pushing them to identify an actionable solution, frustrating as that may be.  Asking questions can also be helpful, to inform yourself about what the other person is experiencing. For example suppose you were talking to a blind person; you get the basic idea of being blind but you don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like, so it&#x27;s quite reasonable to wonder, say, how the person chooses groceries or decides what clothes to put on in the morning. When depression is chronic one develops a variety of coping strategies (which work more or less well at different times), and articulating that sort of thing often helps me get out of a trough and recover my sense of agency.<p>One other thing that&#x27;s very common for people with depression is muscle pain, because the inner tension is often mirrored by a physical tension. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but the physical tension can even act as a focus for the bad feeling. A backrub or a neck rub can go a long way, if the depressed person is feeling up to it. Other times one may not want to be touched and is better off just going to bed or somesuch.",1396635507

If anything I feel like, despite cable-cutters, the vast majority of people out there still regularly consume cable TV in one form or another.  Perhaps what&#x27;s changed is that the &quot;golden age of TV content&quot; right now feels more like the movie industry, in that big cable networks release big TV series and market them heavily almost as if you were going to the theater to watch a blockbuster movie.<p>The online streaming services actually seem diluted now, while cable networks have very strong brands; I don&#x27;t really have netflix but my wife and I have ondemand and a dvr through time warner and 3 different devices to watch amazon through.  The fobs you can get from google and amazon and whomever else will continue to dilute that access to streaming (which is good for competition and for DIYers at some point, I suppose)<p>But really the battle is about whether cable TV will continue to be an always-on service, and in that regard I think it will.  Just flip on your TV, which you may have in several rooms in your house, or at your favorite sports bars, or in the office lobby, or wherever.  It can be background, it can be a social experience for live sporting events (probably the most compelling reason for keeping cable), etc.<p>The other component is that video games are now more compelling to play/watch, and in fact a lot of youtube and twitch channels are now regularly consumed by viewers.<p>I would argue that the &quot;disruption&quot; already happened a long time ago but the cable networks and service providers have adjusted and assimilated to various degrees, such that we now have tons of avenues for stuff to watch.<p>Maybe this just takes some perspective to see because I feel like people keep predicting cable TV will just die or something, and that seems like such a naive way of looking at the world.",1396634973

That&#x27;s a nice feature of both type classes and ML&#x27;s module system as usually implemented in functional languages.  One really nice thing is they can also typically &quot;dispatch&quot; statically on <i>return</i> types of functions too which makes for some neat patterns as well using type inference.<p>Anyway thanks for pointing to that.

Sure, there is a population that doesn&#x27;t watch any TV; but for a while, it was &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; this, and &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; that. People still like to watch their series, they just like to watch it on their time, be it anime (Crunchy Roll), recent TV (Hulu), movies (Amazon, Netflix, etc), recent televised news and pseudo-news (various news and private websites).<p>TV as an injestible X amount of time where you&#x27;re fed pre-recorded or live content isn&#x27;t going anywhere any time soon. In fact, many services exist to provide even live TV in brand new forms. Twitch.TV and LiveStream come to mind.

Nest is a high priced gadget / toy that must be thrown out after 7 years. You&#x27;re better off buying a First Alert or Kidde photoelectric smoke alarm with a 10 year battery. Then you&#x27;ll never have to worry about it for 10 years. They&#x27;ll cost around $30-$40 each.<p>If you want a higher-end serious fire protection system, there are alternatives if you look around. Crossfire alarms are very good (although their website may not be...) They are made in USA (even the plastic injection molding, circuit board assembly, etc).<p>They are wirelessly interconnected, photoelectric smoke alarms with a 10-year battery. They have a heat alarm for the garage, kitchen, furnace closet, attic, etc. These are places you can&#x27;t put a smoke alarm, but also places where fires actually begin. You have smoke alarms in your bedrooms, hallway, and living room; but fires rarely start there. They also have a carbon monoxide alarm; and all the alarms set each other off. If there&#x27;s a fire in your garage, the alarm in your bedroom goes off.<p>They&#x27;re also coming out with products that will send you a text message and call the fire department, and products for the elderly, children, and hearing impaired.<p>These are very high-end systems, and are very expensive (even more than Nest). They&#x27;re sold only by dealers who professionally evaluate the home and install them. This also adds to their cost - you&#x27;re buying an alarm plus a salesman plus an installer.<p>Companies like ADT and AT&T offer good systems that can call the fire department and have other features. But, they&#x27;re expensive, have a monthly fee, and are usually based on normal cheapo alarms.<p>There&#x27;s a few options; but none of them are perfect...",1396634532

113176,comment,112801,112942,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>Well, the problem is fundamentally that the people should've been playing the game before anyone said anything,</i><p>No, that's not true. The proof-by-induction doesn't work without the guru, because the initial case, N=1, is a failure. If there is only one blue-eyed person (call him ""Adam""), he looks around and see a lot of brown-eyed people but has no way to know whether his own eyes are blue, or not. Meanwhile, the other 999 people see a single blue-eyed person, Adam, who isn't leaving the island, but they think it's just because Adam doesn't realize that there are any blue-eyed people at all.<p>Once the guru makes the observation then the chain of induction is set in motion. So, yes, that observation most certainly <i>does</i> convey information.<p>The real question is: why do our minds persist in believing that the guru's statement conveys no information? IMHO, it's a matter of psychology and anthropology. Proof-by-induction is, literally speaking, an inhuman trick. No creature on Earth can do it except humans, and most humans can't do it without special training. (We call those trained humans ""math students"".) Because there weren't any math students around during most of evolutionary history, our mental models of other people's behavior do not include proof-by-induction. When we see a problem like this -- one which involves an island containing 1,000 math students who apply inductive reasoning flawlessly and <i>continuously</i> -- our mental model of behavior just goes haywire. This scenario is literally outside our mind's design parameters, so it's completely nonintuitive.<p>Just solving the problem at all requires a heroic mindhack -- you have to plod along through a
set recipe, starting with the N=1 case and proceeding by a tedious chain of cases. It's fun to imagine a creature who could just <i>see</i> the answer to this problem, in the same way that many, many humans can spot a fleeting facial expression on the face of a <i>Survivor</i> contestant and just <i>know</i>, immediately, who will be voted off the island. (<i>That</i> is a task that our brain <i>was</i> designed for.) Perhaps some savants can do it. Perhaps Ramanujan could have done it. Perhaps Garry Kasparov can do it. Perhaps you can do it (but, if you can, it may be hard to explain how...)",1202695057

113170,comment,112899,113126,0,0,eas,,,"Thanks for pointing that out to me, I should have been clearer in my analysis. I've added an update to the bottom, and hopefully that helps: ""...also please note that I am talking about the best <i>possible</i> education relative to what <i>could be</i> if you were somehow able to take a series of the best classes offered anywhere. I am sure your education was just great in some absolute senseâ€¦just like the Red Sox are pretty good at baseball, even if the All-Star team might be better.""<p>Maybe a web analogy will work better. There is one blog (or group of blogs) today that's the most informative for you. It's a great blog, it's updated frequently, and you like it a lot. Which blogs you read is not random--you've checked out a lot of them, and you know what you like. But what if we could create some sort of blog aggregator that posted links to the best posts of the best blogs? That could be a cool thing, right?",1202693854
113169,comment,113079,113079,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"When, oh, when will someone develop a decent competitor to Ebay?  The site is awful and is ripe for a startup to carve away market share.  They've already proven the business model.  We know it makes money.  I know the boys at auctomatic are doing their best to help out, but what's needed is a full on competitor.<p>I mean, really.  How hard is it to offer a couple of decent looking templates for people to make their own site, to that it isn't such an eyesore?  How hard is it to implement a better form of search and categorization?  How hard is it to develop a form of authentication to cut down on all the fraud that takes place on Ebay?<p>The last time I used Ebay or thought it was decent was back in 97-98.  The site hasn't changed much since.<p>We should have a challenge to see who can develop the best Ebay competitor.",1202693759

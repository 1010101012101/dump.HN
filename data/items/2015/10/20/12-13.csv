Products such as swaps, forward rate agreements, exotic options – and other exotic derivatives – are almost always traded in this way. The OTC derivative market is the largest market for derivatives, and is largely unregulated with respect to disclosure of information between the parties, since the OTC market is made up of banks and other highly sophisticated parties, such as hedge funds. Reporting of OTC amounts is difficult because trades can occur in private, without activity being visible on any exchange.&quot;<p>>&quot;Finally &#x27;yummyfajitas is an ex-HFT who has written good blog posts on the subject.&quot;<p>I would welcome yummyfajitas &#x27;s feedback.

I would create a container and add the tmdb search endpoint with the movie name which will give the list of results sorted by relevance, from that response I&#x27;ll pick the movie name  and TMDB rating to the final response and pipe the IMDB_ID from the response to a parameter of IMDB which will then give it&#x27;s results from which I&#x27;ll send the rating to the final response and so on..<p>The final response would be the Movie name, TMDB Rating, IMDB Rating, etc.. You can customize the key names in the final response too.<p>The APIs would be called sequential so a response from one API can be passed in as a parameter to the next.<p>As for the other parameters to be passed to these URLs, you can either send it as a parameter while calling the root URL or can be stored static in the app while configuring the container.",1445345780

10418821,comment,10417539,10417539,0,0,ThomPete,,,"The fundamental truth about health care is that no amount of taxation or insurance can live up to the demand. Even if you taxed every citizen a 100% there still wouldn&#x27;t be enough to pay for healthcare.<p>And so every society find themselves in one of the most complex paradoxes of modern times.<p>If you tax your way to healthcare and provide everyone with free healthcare like in ex. Denmark, then access to treatment is equal but it&#x27;s always a cost center and your will always mostly lag behind access to the latest treatments.<p>The only way to be able to pay for new equipment or new medicine is either through higher taxes or by budget cuts somewhere else.<p>If you go the insurance way of the US and try to let market forces rule then you end up with highly inflated prices and a younger generation that don&#x27;t insure themselves and therefore don&#x27;t pay for the healthcare system until they need it which drives up the prices of the insurance (hence Affordable Care Act).<p>Here the access isn&#x27;t equal but you have some of the best specialists in the world and always the latest treatments.<p>Then there are countries in the middle trying to find a balance like Switzerland, Germany, the UK and France but even here I fear that no one have found a perfect system either.<p>So no matter how you try and pay for it whether trough trade agreements or NGO etcs that problem still applies. Someone always have to pick up the bill and the bill is potentially infinitely big.<p>Edit: For clarification",1445345767

10418819,comment,10397555,10398456,0,0,richmarr,,,"> But how should that affect a hiring manager?<p>Reverse/positive discrimination is a choice that you can make if you want to. I don&#x27;t know what evidence there is to support or refute its effectiveness, but there&#x27;s both appeal and risk there.<p>Personally I&#x27;d make that call based on the circumstances... a senior recruiter (who has built out some of the best teams in the UK) once told me on team diversity; &quot;as soon as it turns into a sausage-fest you&#x27;re finished&quot;. If an environment was 100% white/male then it&#x27;d be much less hospitable to other groups, so personally I would use positive discrimination in that case. If an environment was 51/49 male/female then I feel positive discrimination would be inappropriate.<p>> Doing one&#x27;s best to look past those labels seems to make sense<p>As long as you can look past those labels. Which you can&#x27;t. Check out the research on moral licencing... it shows that the more you believe that you&#x27;re being meritocratic, the more your subconscious generates excuses for biased behaviour. The only way I know to &#x27;look past&#x27; those labels is to (a) use quotas, which often doesn&#x27;t make sense or (b) use a blinded assessment process & structured interviewing.<p>Option (b) is an area I&#x27;m working on at the moment.<p>> but the article seems to say we need to consciously label and balance the representation.<p>Given that tech is already a sausage-fest, and that it&#x27;s not a natural state of affairs (the gender split having worsened since the 70s), I personally think it&#x27;s acceptable to try to actively rebalance the way tech is presented both within the industry and to broader society. It needs to be okay to be a woman in tech. There need to be role models. And this seems like a pretty harmless way to build towards that outcome... it&#x27;s just speakers at a conference. Nobody is being refused a job because of this, and the speakers will be just as good.",1445345738

I am told all the time, often by news websites, that my government now trusts or distrusts some other government, that my employer now trusts or distrusts or is even part of some other company, etc. I don&#x27;t know if I personally think that the embargoes on Cuba should be lifted, or my company&#x27;s new vice president is qualified for the role, or (if I worked for VMware) Dell is a good employer, or my savings should now be held by Bank of America, or whatever. But that&#x27;s how living and working in a community works.<p>If you have secrets that are too sensitive for community trust, there are other mechanisms, but they typically have trouble scaling very much beyond continuing a previous face-to-face relationship. For the question of whether, say, news.ycombinator.com is who they say they are, I don&#x27;t care enough to take Caltrain down to YC&#x27;s offices and check a fingerprint posted on the wall, if they had one. What I care is that, <i>at scale</i>, the certificate authorities I trust will do a good job of verifying identities and running secure systems.<p>And <i>I</i> am not an auditor or pen-tester of large companies, and even if I were, I wouldn&#x27;t want to spend my spare time auditing and pen-testing all CAs just before I can use the internet. (Importantly, I am not an auditor of web browsers or SSL implementations either, and since I outsource my trust to my browser / SSL stack, it&#x27;s not useful for me to be skeptical of the CAs unless I&#x27;m also skeptical of the code.)<p>Remember that the CA model is bare-minimum security. (Some of the CAs find money in telling you otherwise, but they&#x27;re stretching the truth.) All it&#x27;s providing is the security that, in a perfect world, you would have gotten all along from DNS and IP.

A put option is a deal to sell company stock at a pre-agreed price. Worth noting that you don&#x27;t need company stock before the put option deal is reached.<p>So let&#x27;s say the stock price of Company X is currently valued at $50, and you arrange a put option to sell stock at $50. If the stock price goes down, let&#x27;s say to $25, you buy stock at $25 and sell it at $50, so you&#x27;ve made a profit (from what I understand, you don&#x27;t even need to buy the stock in this case, the put option broker will just pay you the difference to simplify the process).<p>But what if the stock price rises? Let&#x27;s say the stock price rises to $75. You can&#x27;t buy stock and use your put option without losing money, and from what I understand you pay interest to the put option broker for the length of time you have it, so holding onto the put option causes you to lose money.<p>But there&#x27;s a &#x27;get out of jail free&#x27; option. When you arrange the put option you also buy stock. If the stock price goes down, you buy more stock and sell at the pre-agreed put option price. If the stock price goes up, the stock you hold is worth more and you can use this to clear the put option without losing money.<p>From what I understand, this is one example of &#x27;hedging&#x27; against stock price changes, there are probably others. HFT is well suited to this kind of deal, as you can react quickly to market changes, minimising any risks resulting from delays.<p>So although people see the stock market as gambling, you can game the system to move the odds in your favour. The end result is huge volumes of money invested into non-productive uses of money (and because of the ways banks create money, and the ways the financial markets are regulated, the restrictions on this speculation is basically non-existent).<p>EDIT: I&#x27;ve got a downvote on this already.

And, again, looks to have happened just once in 4 billion.<p>Some series of unlikely events.",1445342550

The issue isn&#x27;t only availability, it is speed.  Host in China.  You&#x27;ll probably need an ICP License for this (actually, for anything online), so make sure your customer gets you one (as they&#x27;re legally accountable for what they agree to host in China, as they should be, and are, the &#x27;legal person&#x27;).  Alibaba have VPS solutions very similar to Linode or DO.  Get your customer to agree and pay for this, as you are legally not able to.<p>You mention accessing US sites:  Is this front end or back end?  Locally hosted servers face the same restrictions accessing outside the mainland as home connections do unless specifically negotiated.<p>Do have mobile, at least as a responsive level.  I have no idea who your customer is, but it sounds like they&#x27;re in China and are not-so-tech.  That means they will likely check-up via whatever&#x27;s convenient, and that would probably be via mobile.",1445342445

If you are not an expert biologist you probably shouldn't hold expert opinions on the subject, just as you are probably not an expert surgeon so you shouldn't hold expert opinions on surgery.<p>To choose science for one specialty but pseudo science or dogma for another is inconsistent. The scientific method has brought us both surgery and insight in how we came to be here and so on. It's hypocrisy to claim special knowledge about our origins absence any evidence, but to be happy with the fruits of all that labour when it suits you.<p>I prefer the (true) Mennonites in this respect, at least they are more or less consistent in their beliefs and their application of those beliefs. That doesn't make them less wrong, but they are at least not guilty of hypocrisy.<p>You can't be against evolution and against science at the same time, evolution <i>is</i> science, and science at its best.<p>Just like science put men on the moon and freed us from the shackles of the church it will occasionally cause a change of belief, either by replacing a wrong theory with a better one or by proving a widely held belief to be false.<p>The only reason the ID'ers try to make scientific type arguments is to sound more plausible when faced with scientific opposition, not because they've suddenly seen the light. And dazzling the masses with pseudo science is a great way of confusing the issue, right up to the claim that ID is just another 'theory' that should be given equal time in education.",1271134780

1261192,comment,1260483,1261171,0,0,aphyr,,,"Theora had several drawbacks. Its performance is simply not as good as h264. It's a previous-generation codec based on VP3, whereas VP8 is cutting edge.<p>Flash never supported Theora, which invalidates its use for the vast majority of web users today. Even with HTML5 video, content protection worries is going to keep a lot of content wrapped up in Flash players for a while. On the other hand, Flash has a good chance to support VP8--Adobe already holds a license option on VP7 and has supported the codec line in their players.<p>The lack of players, content hosts, and embedded decoders all prevented Theora from ever taking off. I think there's a better chance that Google's direct backing of a codec (both as a content host, mobile platform, and browser, give VP8 a better shot.<p>I have also read that Theora's ""patent-free"" status is questionable; to my knowledge nobody has reviewed the codebase to ascertain what patents it may infringe on. On2, as a commercial enterprise licensing its codecs to others, has had to navigate the patent minefield already. I trust its status more, especially with Google behind it.<p>As for what Firefox will do, well, that remains to be seen. I just think it makes sense for VP8 to succeed where Theora failed.",1271134529

A consistent/available system can't tolerate partitions, i.e. a split in the network.  However, it can certainly tolerate a single failure and remain consistent and available.  That's the whole point.  A trivial system with these properties is one that replicates every update to all available nodes and requires reads to get matching results from at least half of the nodes.  Paxos is another example.",1271134488

On the odd occasion I've used Python/COM/Excel together, I've really wished for a Python shell inside Excel to do things like:<p><pre><code>  for cell in Range('a1:a10'):\n      cell.Value = cell.Value.split('-')[0]\n</code></pre>\nor whatever. I don't know if Pyinex will quite do that, but thanks for the link!",1271132264

Usually you want code samples in a slightly different font - say a monospaced font - from the rest of your text. And then there's the problem of line wrapping in code samples - in an indentation-sensitive language like Python, that could be more of a problem but even in cases where it doesn't mislead the reader about the way the language works, it could be unsightly. Perhaps you haven't gotten that far yet or someone else will improve upon it and contribute the patches back to you. Great start, though. I was resolute about not getting an iPad but this is the first really good argument I've seen in its favor.",1271131736

Again, maybe I'm just being fickle, but if the physics don't match the native feel, then it just doesn't feel right.<p>Don't understand why they created their own form of copy/paste.<p>The zoomed-out small fonts are completely illegible. I can't even make out header or subheader text, or titles of articles.<p>Startup time, at least for me, was about 3 seconds, compared to immediately for Safari. I just have the 3G, and I'm sure it would be much faster on the 3Gs.<p>When going from vertical to horizontal view, the page does not resize. I have to reload the page for it to fit to the full width.<p>Despite the innovations that I was very excited for, it's the little things, the details, that will keep me from using this app. To me, good execution is in the details. Some of the things above, for me, are simply musts. An example would be a car that must feel good to sit in, have sharp steering control, easy-to-reach controls and a solid-feeling gearbox. Extra-cool features without this are non-starters. These are the things Safari gives me which Opera lacks.",1271131312

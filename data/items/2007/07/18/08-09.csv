But I don't mention any of what I learn to my co-founder (who does most of the core development), because I don't want our product to be driven too much by what competitors do.  We have hundreds of customers ourselves...and they probably know what they want as well as anybody.<p>Anyway, it's easy to get side-tracked by outside stuff...so pay attention to your market, but not too much.",1184747374

Downthread[0] there is somebody lamenting tab being used to activate the completion.  I don&#x27;t know what shell they use, but if they use zsh they already have a myriad of completion options available to them.  Taking advantage of the features provided in this terminal emulator <i>and</i> zsh simultaneously would undoubtedly be problematic <i>(actually, last I heard they seem to have somehow broken &#x27;vi support&#x27;, so whether or not arbitrary zsh configurations will even work on it is questionable)</i>.  If we want Finalterminal to support the extensive range of completion that zsh already does, we are going to have a <i>lot</i> of duplicated effort.  Completion features should therefore be implemented at the same level that they have always existed at, the shell and/or application (think vim) layer.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6574405"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6574405</a>",1382136382

In particular, the &quot;impact&quot; part of their reports says the next 1-3 degrees of warming will on-net increase agricultural productivity - it&#x27;ll be easier to feed the world. If you look at the underlying studies the biggest positive impacts seem to be: (1) In the northern regions that currently produce the most food, warming means longer growing seasons means more food. (2) Near the equator where it&#x27;s too hot to grow most crops, extra CO2 makes growing trees much more productive.",1382135817

I&#x27;m a woman, dealt with a number of more unpleasant situations, but wouldn&#x27;t accept my life shuttered  because somebody told me so. It&#x27;s only beneficial for drama queens/kings, while naive people are thrown into the state of helplessness and hysteria without even realizing it. It&#x27;s totally the opposite to the women empowerment, the one we want.<p>I would add 2 things - according to his (now removed, but still available in wayback machine) blog <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20130923014010/http://objo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20130923014010/http://objo.com/</a> Joe O&#x27;Brian wrote that he was looking for professional help with mental issues or such in June 2013 (substance abuse? a rehab?). So, now the internet is lynching a sick person who already realized a problem and was seeking help? How nice. While the other side blames her drinking problems on the society and &quot;male industry&quot; (how childish).<p>Second, having dealt with drunk men myself (no drugs or guns involved, just alcohol - like in the story). A slap in the face usually works very well to help him keep his hands to himself. If it still doesn&#x27;t work, a good smash in the face and moving away works even better. Unless, a lady gets so plastered that she can&#x27;t move or use her brain, or she&#x27;s a damsel in distress type. Then her life was ruined long before somebody put a hand into her pants.",1382133722

Once again, my goal here is to separate the things we consume on HN from the actual business models in the background. Yep, it&#x27;s certainly not as simple as $ per Twitter followers. There&#x27;s also a Heisenberg Effect here, where the closer the HN audience looks at a thing, the more distorted the results we get are.<p>I&#x27;m a big fan of Brennan and Nathan&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve also spent quite a bit of money on things the HN crowd thought was cool for startups which didn&#x27;t amount to a hill of beans. It&#x27;s very difficult having a discussion with 100K of your best buds about ways to find your own way in the X arena. Too many slightly diverse interests all playing out at the same time in the same forum :)<p>Geesh. I could start a list of high quality services offered by great HNers for startups. Things that, if you need them, could easily pay for themselves. Some of your stuff would be at the top of that list. It would not be a short list.",1382133705

The accumulated findings from several experiments help build a convincing case, but unfortunately the field study - which had the potential to provide the most persuasive evidence - is seriously flawed. The actor apologised (sic) for the rain then asked to borrow a phone, or in the comparison condition he just asked to borrow the phone. There was no proper control condition. <i>This means we don&#x27;t know if the impact of the apology was specific to making an apology or merely an effect of uttering any kind of ice-breaker.</i><p>This is a devastating objection to the findings of the study.<p>Here&#x27;s a link to the study: <a href=""http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/Brooks%20Dai%20Schweitzer%202013_d2f61dc9-ec1b-485d-a815-2cf25746de50.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/Brooks%20Dai%...</a>",1382133617

In the US, there are state-specific variations, and internationally, the laws can be very different.<p>Some of the documents though are useful all over the world, so the collection is definitely awesome!",1215765464

Getting a car that works at this level of efficiency requires three or four conceptual jumps, which weren't made until a market forces induced some thought on the problem.<p>Additionally, none of the interested parties have figured out the last step: how to cheaply charge the thing (while recycling the waste energy). But I think I might have.",1215764651
243358,comment,242636,243082,0,0,swombat,,,"You're making it sound like so-called ""mature enterprises"" approach scaling in a mature way. Perhaps ""enterprises"" like Yahoo, Amazon and Google do, but I worked in a very mature investment bank for 4 years and though they had some load testing, none of the systems I ever saw built were prepared to handle a load that might grow by a factor of 10 in a year. In fact, most of them struggled to slowly deliver even with the current load. That's true for both internal bank systems and external client-facing ones.",1215764637

243356,comment,242833,242833,0,0,jhancock,,,"I read the American Scholar Article <a href=""http://www.theamericanscholar.org/su08/elite-deresiewicz.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theamericanscholar.org/su08/elite-deresiewicz.htm...</a> .  Its well written from a man who taught English at Yale for the last 10 years.  Worth a read independent of this VC issue.<p>This issue of lack of innovation or exclusivity in the VC and start-up founders community comes up often.\nThe general thesis of these jabs is that somehow the world is ""missing out"" by relying on Ivy Leagues too much.  My instinct says this is true.  However, I don't think it matters.  Innovators from non-Ivy Leagues will always find their way.  VCs will one day loosen up and chase the deals from these sources or they won't and someone else will reap the rewards.<p>If the point is: The rich get richer and people with access get more...well, ok sure ;)<p>fyi, I'm not from an Ivy League background and I do just fine as an IT entrepreneur.  I do not have easy access to capital, partially due to my non-Ivy League background, but only a very small part.  I don't lose sleep over this.  I rely on building good products and a customer base in order to attract investment and preferably revenue.  I've come to prefer this approach.  Every time I've had access to VC money early, its been a disaster.",1215764349
243355,comment,242636,243121,0,0,swombat,,,"It's a fallacy to think that you can avoid all scalability problems. You can't. If you're successful, you will have scalability issues, period. So yes, since the problem is inevitable so long as you're successful, it is a nice problem to have.<p>It's a bit like having a cold. That's practically inevitable at some point in your life if you're alive. Well, I'd rather be alive with a cold than dead, even though having a cold sucks. If you don't want scalability issues, they're very easy to avoid: just build a crappy service. One of my start-ups never had any scalability issues, and never had a stampede of users either.",1215763875

243352,comment,243176,243317,0,0,newt0311,,,"Which would be all fine and dandy until we look at past history of such maneuvers and find that <i>no</i> government has ever done this and survived. A good example of a government inflating currency to repay debt would be post-WW1, pre-Hitler Germany.<p>Furthermore, there aren't just two options for huge unpayable debt. First of, even a debt of $14 trillion is not enormous and unpayable for the US gov. (though with a few decades of medicare, medicaid, and social security benifits, it will be).<p>Furthermore, here the US gov. has a choice to reduce tax payer liability which is what makes the idea of explicit backing for Fannie Mae and friends particularly stupid. If done carefully, these monsters can be slowly unwound and the ticking fuse they represent, diffused. Even if they were to implode in the middle of this process, I would like to argue that the longterm benefits of removing these companies and not adding $5 trillion to the US national debt would outweigh the short term losses.<p>Lastly, the only description for an organization which<p>a) Can tax a group of 300 million people,\nb) can decide its own liability, and\nc) still ends up incurring crippling levels of debt<p>can only be described as terminally stupid and a drag on society.",1215763306

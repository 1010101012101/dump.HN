They're just there to crack your kneecaps if you don't.<p>Swank is the most well known company that sells rights for public performances of blockbuster films. Costs average between $150 and $300 for ""non-theatrical"" showings (where you aren't selling any tickets)<p>But why shell out such ungodly sums for the muddied films of the masses? The mobmov makes small showings (< 50 people) feasible, so we can show more special-interest independent films.<p>And independent films are so much easier to license. For the showing featured in the Chronicle, we watched a wonderful Canadian film called A Simple Curve. It's not something to draw the crowds, but this, at least in my experience, means a more thoughtful and meaningful script. Our showing was licensed through the film distributor (filmmovement.com) directly for a small fee.<p>So no, you'll never see a movie like Tranformers playing on the wall of your local dilapidated warehouse.<p>The good news is that independent filmmakers don't like the system either. It restricts their creativity and screws them at every turn. My hope is that as independent filmmakers find out about this new avenue for release, we'll start to see new films produced that are ever more inventive and unique.",1185932372

If they hack it to install their own apps, Apple will just release a patch to stop them.<p>I was kinda hoping updating would be more difficult so that the hackers could put pressure on Apple to release an open SDK.",1185932074

This is what a startup should do post demo-day.<p>Throwing away something that's been tuned to target customers is a mistake.  This is what Joel is talking about.<p>Most importantly, these are very, very different activities.<p>Except, of course, when time and money is ticking and they're not.  Then you have to brave (which is what you call it when it works) or foolish (which is what you call it when it doesn't).",1185931811

38232,comment,38196,38196,0,0,mark-t,,,"I completely agree with Joel. I've done major refactoring work by making a series of minor alterations that clearly don't change anything. This approach takes a lot less time and doesn't introduce nearly as many bugs. Our svn repository is at revision 4995, and that's forked from a project that's 4 years older. Imagine how many of those commits have been bug fixes, and you'll see the big problem with rewriting.",1185930292

Yes, I thought parts were messy... but there was also great stuff in it that I'm very happy survived intact.<p>Then decades later, on an entirely different product, in a different business...<p>We had to migrate our product to a new OS platform, as well as needing to fulfill much wider requirements for our customers.  The existing code just wouldn't allow this, even if it were stretched and stretched.<p>So I rewrote most of the codebase.<p>In some ways I was tortured knowing we had a functioning product that already handled things I was rewriting (even though it was on an obsolete platform).  Especially since the rewriting process takes longer than <i>zero</i>.<p>On the other hand, the new set of code turned out smaller, simpler, more reliable, much more flexible, and is now working well as a foundation our for business.<p>Both sides of the argument make sense to me, I think it just depends on the situation.",1185930156

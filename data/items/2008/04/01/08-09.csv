151873,comment,149052,149052,0,0,stevetose,,,"I believe the author, who is self-important, is calling me a dilettante (clearly he would say that, he's a writer). He's wrong. He thinks people shouldn't argue. His main point seems to be that people will be happier if they agree with him, but I'm enjoying this post anyway. And he said, ""people are getting angrier"".

151868,comment,151109,151678,0,0,Jd,,,"You haven't addressed Pg's unstated presuppositions.  His 'telos' is that the programmers should be happy -- although only circumstantial evidence is presented it is likely he is correct that large organizations undermine such.<p>Of course, persons can sacrifice for the greater good or a greater civilizational vision.  This produces societies, not tribes. Your space program example serves to illustrate what is possible in the context of such a vision.",1207039563
151867,comment,151806,151806,0,0,marketer,,,"Try opening up a python interpreter and running help(int). You'll notice something surprising -- there are over 50 methods available for ints. This ranges from all the basic math operations, shifts, boolean operations, and high precision math functions.<p>The actual data itself is small, either 4 or 8 bytes, depending on the architecture. Now, depending on the language php was written in (I believe it is C), the other ~60 bytes is probably has metadata associated with all the operations.",1207039424

151864,comment,151767,151858,0,0,ardit33,,,"ok, maybe should I have clarified:  most people (women too), in SF just dress like they just rolled out of bed.  (exception, those that work for financial companies downtown SF). It is part of the culture around here.  Comfortable but not visually appealing.  And yes, you can be smart and dress cute at the same time.<p>But at the end it boil down to numbers.  I was browsing around linked in the profile of some of the area companies,  (now linked in has basic stats for all companies), and everwyere the ratio was ranging from 70% male, 30% female, to 80%/20% male female ratio.   So, if you are girl in the valley, you don't have to do much to get attention.  In NYC, it is the oposite, lot's of girls in the city, hence more competition, so they have to try harder to get attention.  That's why you have Sex and the City, Lipstick Jungle, 30 Rock, shows, all revolving around 30+ yo females that can't find a man good enough for them.<p>So, that party just looked like the average tech party around here.  (the worst are the digg parties).",1207039123

I only knows what the Internets tells me, and the Internets have spoken about Intercosmos/DirectNIC.<p>If you find a good one, let me know, as we provide automatic registration in our product, but we're not ecstatic about only supporting one registrar (Register.com) that is known mainly for being expensive...they are seemingly honest and their tools are fine, but even reseller pricing is too high (and their retail prices are laughably high).",1207038973

3641334,comment,3639649,3641097,1,0,baconner,,,"I completely agree with your reasoning on why weather data is public data. Its actually not an argument about business at all but one of the public interest.<p>To expand on you reasoning a bit I think there is a general test we can apply to all government data collection and publishing practices. If the data is being collected then its been determined to be in the public's interest to do so and therefore it's also in the public interest to release it freely in a reasonably accessible format. If the set is not useful then releasing it serves to at least inform citizens that we're wasting money so we can exert pressure to stop collecting the useless set.<p>The exception of course is gov data that may have privacy or security implications but nevertheless eventually it should be released when those concerns are no longer valid.",1330390703

3641332,comment,3640881,3641214,2,0,morsch,,,"I would find option 1 and possibly option 2 off-putting in anything other than a game. I realise progress bars are a more-or-less rough estimate (ie. ""they lie""). Just make it as good an estimate as you can reasonably do, and that's fine.<p>For bonus points, display the underlying data in some way so that I can draw my own conclusions, supplanted with ""sidechannel"" information I am likely to have, e.g. previous experience with the process if nothing else. Extra bonus points if you make this information optionally visible so that I can tune it out if I don't need it and my mom doesn't get confused. I really like modern copy dialogs in that regard (and not-so-modern ones on decent file managers).<p>If you can't make the estimate reasonable at all, <i>don't make a progress bar</i> and display progress in some other manner instead. E.g. if you are copying files, and you have no way of knowing how large each file is, consider simply putting down a simple count (""Files copied: x/y"") and if at all possible some indication that the program is progressing at all (""Current speed: x MB/s"").<p>Finally, please do try to add some kind of progress information for any task that can take more than a few seconds. It's incredibly frustrating to stare at a ""busy"" mouse pointer[1], having to guess whether an application has locked up or if it's just taking extremely long. If you get it wrong, you usually end up re-trying and being faced with the same situation. I have had to play detective around applications misbehaving that way, and having to use top, iotop, etc. to determine whether an app is using CPU, hard disk or network resources is both a lot of work and non-conclusive (not to mention beyond the capabilities of most users).<p>(This started out as a short reply and ended up quite being a more general rant; the second time this has happened to me tonight. Sorry about that.)<p>[1] Though terminal utilities are often just as bad, because they're not just designed with interactive usage in mind. However, each individual terminal utility tends to do <i>less</i>, which means complex process are broken down anyway, which yields some progress information.",1330390650

3641330,comment,3641184,3641184,28,0,lukifer,,,"These conditions aren't unique to warehouse jobs; the customer call-center industry is similar in many ways. Time is tracked down to the second, you are being recorded and/or monitored at all times, tardiness and absenteeism are ruthlessly enforced with no excuses, and there is relentless pressure to ""hit your numbers"", which are often nearly impossible. And of course, you're still expected to ""always put the customer first"" under these insane conditions.<p>If you don't live up in any respect, they're happy to let the next batch of trainees have your job. In fact, they prefer it; those with 5+ years of experience have the most to fear, as they acquire raises and cushier benefits over time, and so are often fired for the same infraction that gets a newbie a write-up.<p>I suppose that call centers are preferable to warehouses, in that there is little risk of injury, and there are more opportunities to move up or transfer careers. Still, this is one of the human costs of corporate capitalism in general: if you don't have rare or specialized skills, you have no negotiating power, and have to take whatever you can get.

3641291,comment,3639717,3639717,1,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"My father, formerly a union rubber worker in Akron, once noted that, when the big tire manufacturers stopped paying workers in cash on payday, their wives were ecstatic.  This was because, on payday, a not insignificant fraction of guys would take their wads of cash and head off to the bar.  Or, they would take out $20 and hand the rest over to their wives, telling them that the remainder was the amount they had earned.  Apparently, it was not until the 1960's that paychecks became the standard in Akron for union laborers at the Big Three.  My dad's view, from having talked to many men working in the factory, was that the majority of the era's blue collar married men simply turned their checks over to their wives, asked for a few dollars for beer/cigarettes, and allowed the women to manage the financial matters of the household.  This is in stark contrast to anecdotes I've read/heard about the wives of white collar men during the same period who were largely in the dark about household finances.<p>Perhaps a significant fraction of men were never terribly ambitious, but they maintained social acceptability through the ease by which they could earn a middle-class living as a union factory worker?  Their wives seemed content to ""wear the pants"" by taking care of financial affairs.  Of course, to outsiders, they likely allowed the man to maintain some sense of dignity by feigning subservience (my presumption of the era's cultural standards).  I'm not suggesting that factory work was not physically taxing, but jobs were generally available for anyone who wanted one.  My dad recalls collecting factory job offers from Firestone, Goodyear, and BF Goodrich in a single day.  Some guys who couldn't read or write very well would bring someone with them to fill out the application forms.<p>Is it that today's men lack the ambition of those from a generation before, or has the disappearance of union manufacturing jobs and other for-the-asking means of maintaining a middle-class lifestyle take away the false floor keeping men grounded?",1330389623

I find the Facebook news feed to be just about as useful as the Github news feed... which is to say, totally useless.<p>The problem, as I see it, is that G+, Twitter, Github, etc. all make the same fundamental mistake... assuming that ""connecting"" to an ""entity"" means ""I want to see every update from/about this entity.""  So, I ""friend"" somebody on G+ or ""watch"" a project on Github, now I'm on the hook to see all their updates.   But there's NO particular reason to think that the above assertion holds.  At best, ""friending"" a person or ""watching"" a project says you're more interested in it/them than a random project/person.<p>These ""event stream"" implementations really need one or both of two things:  The ability to specify more about <i>what</i> it is you're interested in, and smarter ML algorithms to figure out what to show you, based on both declared (or, for that matter, inferred) interests, and social connections, OR the ability to specify filters to exclude ""stuff you don't want.""<p>If I had to choose, I'd ask for the latter.  Better filters would go a long way towards giving us control of our streams / news-feeds.  I'd like, for example to be able to say ""I don't want any pictures of cats with funny hats, regardless of who posted them, in my stream.""  Or, in the Github example ""I don't want any commits from project $FOO in my stream.""<p>If I'd seen much (or any) evidence to suggest that the machine learning stuff was smart enough to give me a truly meaningful feed without manual tweaking, I would care less about filters, but so far I'm just not seeing it.  Facebook appear to try, but my feed there is still full of crap because they assume too much based on <i>who</i> I follow, not <i>what</i> I'm interested in.<p><rant-over />",1330389158

3641236,comment,3641103,3641103,1,0,mikeocool,,,"The answer is it really depends. In my experience both in hiring and working as a contractor, I tend to do a day-based rate when the contractor is working essentially as an extension of the in-house team, that is they don't have a project with explicit requirements and timeline, they're just going to be delegated tasks as they come up. A library for a REST API seems like a task that can be fairly well defined upfront. Assuming that you can define what you want in a fairly tight spec, I think most contractors would be willing to give you a fixed price for a project like that.<p>Defining 'finished' goes hand in hand with the spec. Write up a document with some basic design reqs, the classes you want, the methods they should have, include examples of what you API outputs or at least have links to your docs, and call out any edge cases. Additionally, I find it hugely beneficial to ensure that contractors right unit tests, then as you're QAing the code and find bugs, you can add failing tests for them to fix.<p>In the case of 'finishing' maintaining a good relationship with your contractors throughout the project goes a long way. Most people are happy to deal with a handful small issues that you might have forgotten to add to the spec, if they're enjoying working with you. If you've been adding new features and constantly changing things throughout, they're going to be a more interested in getting rid of you as a client than helping you out at the end.<p>Not sure exactly what you mean by project overrun. But one key is work with the contractor to put together a timeline of milestones. And be sure to include time you to QA and then for them to resolve any issues. Once you have that, immediately understand that the deadlines will most likely be blown. Also, obviously make sure you have a contract that references the spec and the timeline, so in the event of a failure to deliver on the contractors part, your not stuck still footing the bill.",1330388280

The key is to (1) define your target audience as concretely as possible and (2) understand what shared vocabulary you have at your disposal.<p>Saying ""Bayesean"" or ""gamma distribution"" is going to put you out of reach of anyone non-technical.  Saying ""conjugate prior"" or ""shape parameter"" is going to put you out of reach of anyone who isn't a practiced statistician.<p>I'd aim somewhere in the middle.  Technical people who aren't afraid of following a well-outlined, mathematical description of a problem they encounter regularly.  ""Why a gamma distribution?"" would be a good footnote, for example, linking to a paper or another blog post of yours that explains it in more detail.<p>I find the articles that do the best are ones which take a somewhat-complicated topic and explain it, step-by-step, to an intelligent, technical audience.

Write something that is not just a one-off, but could serve as reference material months and years from now.<p>I'm probably at the upper-end of this target audience in terms of mathematical maturity, in the sense that when you say ""conjugate prior"" I know what you mean but can't remember the definition off the top of my head.  However, I could look it up and understand it instantly.

As for Lift, the folks on the mailing list (liftweb @ Google Groups) are very helpful when it comes to figuring out whether Lift is appropriate for any given project or not (basically, do you specifically need its features and have a developer team with the ability and bandwidth to ramp up quickly enough for your deadline).<p>PS - nothing against Clojure, not trying to hijack this whole thread, just add to it.

Change the progress text to something like ""Uhm...err...well, this is a bit embarrassing..."", then go one to explain it's taking a little longer then expected.<p>Then say something like ""OH MY GOD! THAT SPIDER BEHIND YOU IS THE BIGGEST I'VE EVER SEEN!!!"". While the user is presumably turned around to check out the giant spider, drop the bar back to 80% or so, and pretend nothing ever happened.<p>2. Report progress bar inaccuracy back to the server, which can look and see if there thing is being consistently off in one direction and make a correction factor available to subsequent users of my software.<p>Might also stats to the user at the end of the operation, telling them things like ""This progress bar was off by 10%. The average user's progress bar was off by 20%. Congratulations! Your computer was more reliable and consistent than average!""",1330387676

3641209,comment,3641103,3641103,6,0,rogerbinns,,,"I'm a contractor.  Make sure that the contract specifies upper limits, and that it covers some process.  For example it should specify the maximum monthly or weekly payment as appropriate payout.  It should have a termination clause (""either party may terminate the contract on immediate written notice for any reason or for no reason"").  It is also a good idea to cover invoices and payments (""invoices must be submitted with 14 days of month end and payments must be made within 14 days of invoice receipt"").  That will remove a lot of stress from the relationship so both can concentrate on the work at hand.<p>I've always done hourly because the clients were not able to specify upfront exactly what they wanted, and priorities would keep changing.  Additionally they would find that I'm good at other things and can help in ways they didn't anticipate.  Everyone benefited.<p>If you can accurately specify exactly what needs to be done, and know you won't change things then ask for fixed price bids.  Contractors will know how to respond.  There is no perfect way of protecting yourself from below expectations work, but contract limits mean you know the worst that can happen.  (eg if you say you won't pay for more than 40 hours a week then they can't suddenly surprise with 120 hours of work after the first week.)  Being able to immediately terminate also means you can cut your losses early if you need to.<p>I always end up spending a lot of time on the intellectual property parts of the contracts since they are usually egregious land grabs written by lawyers.  It is really tedious getting that fixed up.  Know up front what is happening with the copyright (you can retain it exclusively, or give the contractor their own copyright on a copy) and licensing.  I'd certainly give discounts for open source work, especially something that I can freely reuse elsewhere - it helps as a reference and it helps future work.<p>TLDR: you can't perfectly protect yourself, but be optimistic and plan on good things happening",1330387557

Often this would mean the progress bar went straight from 93% to complete - but this was preferred (better than stalling at 100% for minutes at a time).<p>Eventually we automated the sync process, and the customer was happier looking at the occasional exception report instead of a progress bar.",1330387554

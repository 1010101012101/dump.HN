And, yes, they steal bikes with impunity, amongst other things.<p>Even if you do get stopped for genuine wrong-doing, the worst that happens is you get a talking to or a citation at the nearest kban.

I'd like to offer some customers an infinite free trial while others only get a month free after which time they have to upgrade. The email flow for each of these types of customers would be quite different over the first couple of months. Different actions would trigger different emails at different times. That logic is not really something you want deep in your app (as I say, that's more <i>marketing</i> logic than <i>app</i> logic).<p>Looking through the other links provided in the sibling posts I'm starting to think the right way of doing this is using an event tracking system (Mixpanel type idea, but maybe storing that information internally). Then you have a rules engine outside of the app to send out the emails. It then becomes trivial to segment as in my a/b testing example, or to not send out more than one of a certain type of email a day etc.<p>Thanks for all the thoughts on it though - it's helped to push me in the right direction.",1346230507

Apple always was the little guy and had it's faithful niche market. It was the ""underdog"" that everyone rooted (or at least deep down felt a bit felt sorry for). Now it has ""sold out"" and gone mainstream. It has become a greedy corporate giant and with it's figurehead now out of the picture - it's image has begun to tarnish even faster.<p>I predict that dislike or even hatred toward apple will begin to expand until it equals or surpasses that we see of Microsoft today. It will no longer be ""hip"" and once this image slips - Apple will plummet.<p>This coupled by other tech companies (including all other smartphone manufacturers) banding together and defeating Apple's garbage patent claims (they own a patent on a perfect rectangle as part of a UI design?) will spell an end of a great run for Apple where innovation boomed, but was overcome by greed -leading to their eventual downfall.",1346230411

4447611,comment,4444793,4447604,5,0,saurik,,,"First, there is a major difference between MVCC and update-in-place that you can detect as a client, and that difference is that the problems that Rich outlines at the beginning of his talk do not happen: if one client edits something in the database, other transactions do not get an inconsistent view because the data on disk has already been permanently and irrevocably ""updated in place"". (Which, to be clear, means that modern SQL databases do not ""expose a view to the world of an update in place database"".)<p>Second, if all that is required to get his model is to add a command to an existing database (such as PostgreSQL, as I feel I know enough about how it works to be confident that this would be a reasonably simple task) ""mark the current transaction read-only and pretend that it is as old as transaction X"" (something that can be implemented quite rapidly in an existing system like PostgreSQL) we really aren't talking about something that is either very new, or that totally reinvents the ""traditional database"".",1346229855

You iterate because the design has some issues that are worth addressing.<p>The nice thing about iterative development is you can build amazingly complex systems that way, systems that are so complex they have no obvious deficiencies.  Of course that's also the not-so-nice thing about iterative development too.  But either way iteration is a development process.  It isn't something that is a design characteristic.<p>I do think however that <i>good design is flexible.</i>  It tolerates changes on all sides.   Users can repurpose it.  Developers can improve on it.  Good design is robust in that it handles these changes.  If you want to use that to iterate the design, go ahead, but that's the design principle.",1346229751

Were you expecting rocket science?<p>I was expecting a logically sound, coherent response - not straw-man appealing to mysticism.<p>My original question was I am having a tough time figuring out what is this Indian heritage, and I don't see which part of me comes from Indian heritage, and not from being a decent(or indecent) human being and common sense. The answer is none. It was as simple as that.<p>> Your heritage today includes a grand ability to argue, and to mistake articulation for action. You didn't come across as someone who wanted to leave it at that.<p>""grand ability to argue""<p>""mistake articulation for action""<p>Take a breath.<p>If you don't want to discuss(or argue as you put it), don't throw around bullshit on public forums. More importantly, don't add more bullshit on existing pile(mistake articulation for action? Where the fuck that came from?)<p>> I am glad you have those answers, but those are your personal answers.<p>Never claimed otherwise.<p>> I am not providing authority, I am providing history. You had a question, you got an answer.<p>No, I don't have an answer to my question that ""I am having a hard time figuring out what exactly is my Indian heritage"". For the nth time, when you specifically label something as ""Indian heritage"", it has to be specifically Indian and inherited, not something which is common among people worldwide.<p>> If you want your answer to be something else, well read through Indian history.<p>Now what on earth would that mean? If I want my answer to be different, read History? And get the fuck off your high horse. Reading a couple of books and assuming other people don't know about Indian history isn't a commendable quality.<p>> Your final para is about having normal standards to deal with people. Its a great system, stick to it. But again, your question was about heritage not common sense behavior.<p>Please stop intentionally misrepresenting my question and your answers. In response to what the hell is Indian heritage question, you had a blurb about helping north-eastern folks, to which I said is a common sense behavior and not some distinctly Indian heritage.<p>> I am pointing out as well, that the way that melting pot was bound together was often through mysticism.<p>If you are just going to throw claims around, have some citations for what is your mysticism and how it binds India. And no, ""read history"" doesn't cut it - cite me particular instances and occurrences. India isn't and was never bound(if it is bound at all) by religion.<p>EDIT: And if it's still too hard for you to comprehend why I was pointing out India is a diverse country, my purpose was to establish there is no ""Indian heritage/culture/tradition/whatever"". India is gigantic and diverse, and there isn't a common pattern significant enough to warrant a mention. When different parts of India has significantly different culture and tradition on macro(north-south) and micro(tamil brahmins and non-brahmins, castes within the same religion), Indian culture means nothing, and that is a good thing. Same goes for Indian heritage.",1346229093

The regime built <i>thousands</i> of primary schools across the country, and made 4th class mandatory for all kids, girls and boys. Before Salazar, our country had a 19th century mentality, derived from monarchy, whereas girls weren't supposed to need school and only ""doctors"" would be put through it. The vast majority of the population was not educated in any sense. For all its faults, Salazar's regime managed to change that and raise Portugal to close to the european education standards. That change took decades, it's not something you can do in 5 years.
Just as a side note, the some goes for general infrastructures in Portugal. It was a dictatorship, yes, will all the crap that entails, but, after monarchy and the corrupt governments of the 10s and 20s that bankrupted Portugal, it was his regime that raised the bar here in Portugal, until we got fed up with the lack of liberty to express ourselves.

4447554,comment,4444793,4444793,17,0,saurik,,,"Watching this talk has so far (I'm halfway through, and now giving up) been very disappointing, primarily because many of the features and implementation details ascribed to ""traditional databases"" are not true of the common modern SQL databases, and almost none of them are true of PostgreSQL. As an initial trivial example, many database systems allow you to store arrays. In the case of PostgreSQL, you can have quite complex data types, from dictionaries and trees to JSON, or even whatever else you want to come up with, as it is a runtime extensible system.<p>However, it really gets much deeper than these kinds of surface details. As a much more bothersome example that is quite fundamental to the point he seems to be taking with this talk, at about 15:30 he seriously says ""in general, that is an update-in-place model"", and then has multiple slides about the problems of this data storage model. Yet, <i>modern databases don't do this.</i> Even <i>MySQL</i> doesn't do this (anymore). Instead, modern databases use MVCC, which involves storing all historical versions of the data for at least some time; in PostgreSQL, this could be a very long time (when a manual VACUUM occurs; if you want to store things forever, this can be arranged ;P).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_contro...</a><p>This MVCC model thereby directly solves one of the key problems he spends quite a bit of time at the beginning of his talk attempting to motivate: that multiple round-trips to the server are unable to get cohesive state; in actuality, you can easily get consistent state from these multiple queries, as within a single transaction (which, for the record, is very cheap under MVCC if you are just reading things) almost all modern databases (Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL...) will give you an immutable snapshot of what the database looked like when you started your transaction. The situation is actually only getting better and more efficient (I recommend looking at PostgreSQL 9.2's serializable snapshot isolation).<p>At ~20:00, he then describes the storage model he is proposing, and keys in on how important storing time is in a database; the point is also made that storing a timestamp isn't enough: that the goal should be to store a transaction identifier... but again, this is how PostgreSQL already stores its data: every version (as again: it doesn't delete data the way Rich believes it does) stores the transaction range that it is valid for. The only difference between existing SQL solutions and Rich's ideal is that it happens per row instead of per individual field (which could easily be modeled, and is simply less efficient).<p>Now, the point he makes at ~24:00 actually has some merit: that you can't easily look up this information using the presented interfaces of databases. However, if I wanted to hack that feature into PostgreSQL, it would be quite simple, as the fundamental data model is already what he wants: so much so that the indexes are still indexing the dead data, so I could not only provide a hacked up feature to query the past but I could actually do so efficiently. Talking about transactions is even already simple: you can get the identifier of a transaction using txid_current() (and look up other running transactions if you must using info tables; the aforementioned per-row transaction visibility range is even already accessible as magic xmin and xmax columns on every table).",1346228339

Researchers use them, the government uses them, some big business use them.<p>From my point of view, there are four ""mainframe"" concepts, and one of them is not a monolithic mainframe <i>per se</i>:<p>1. Supercomputers: thousands of CPUs, each with access to a few gigabytes of RAM, which can run massively parallel jobs<p>2. Shared memory machines: 64-256 CPUs, each of them can access to 0.5-2TB of memory<p>3. GPUs: Hundreds of CPUs, each with access to 1-4 GPUs and a few gigabytes of RAM, to run highly parallel vector jobs<p>4. Clusters: Commodity hardware (either racked or workstations) connected by a network which uses a queue system<p>The first three belong to the modern implementation of the mainframe, the last one is a ""supercomputing""-like facility, built with regular hardware.<p>This brings us to OP's article, and to my main point. There are many research centres, business and government which use them, but there is a trend towards using regular Intel processors instead of mainframe-like vector processors.<p>Why? Because they're easier to program for. Us at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center have worked with ppc, ppc64, cell, ia64, i686 and x86_64 architectures, and here's what happened.<p>Some of these architectures don't have debugging/profiling tools available.<p>I joke with my colleagues about how it has been 10 years from the first CPU with hyperthreading and we still don't have fully automated tools to take advantage of parallelism on legacy code. We know it's difficult to do, but that has to be taken into account when planning to buy a new machine. Old code might run slower on the new machine because of the highly parallelism but lower raw speed.<p>Others (cell) are just so difficult to optimize that we needed 2 postdocs working 2 years only to make a matrix multiplication take about 80% of the full computing power. I'll only say that our next machine was going to be a Cell supercomputer, but that idea was dropped after a scientific panel advised against it.<p>Some months ago I took a course on GPU programming, and for those of you who have never programmed on vector processors, it is like the Hello World in brainfuck. My CS degree+masters wasn't just enough. It is overwhelming. The guy teaching the course was a PhD with 3 year experience programming GPUs, and he admitted that most of the times, if you compare the time it takes for you to program on a GPU with the time you save running the software, it is just not worth it. Hey, sometimes it is, and you save a lot of time. But not for most cases. So we're back to regular Intel processors again.<p>What I'm trying to say is that nowadays we buy machines for different purposes (large number of cores, large amount of memory, large throughput for vector multiplication, etc) but <i>most of them are x86_64</i>. GPUs are an exception because we buy software which has already been adapted to vector operations, but somebody had to spend many days adapting the code.<p>We work with Intel and IBM and we have access to the most recent CPUs and tools. IBM makes great hardware but they don't have anybody writing a development framework for that hardware, so you never reach even 70% of its peak throughput.<p>TL;DR: Yes, many companies use mainframes, but most of them try to put x86_64 processors in there, because they are easier to parallelise and there are many tested programming tools available.",1346227762

What makes the system complex is not the existence of more than one tax bracket, it's the bewildering array of itemized deductions one can take. Most of the 'simplifications' set out to accomplish two goals it seems: 1) simplify code 2) somehow lower rates. Unfortunately, when they try to be ""revenue neutral"" by closing loopholes, those hardest hit are the middle and lower class because of the mortgage interest deduction. So ultimately, many of these plans look like a tax cut for the rich and raising taxes for the middle class by taking away their deductions.",1346227391

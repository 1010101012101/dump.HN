7046478,comment,7045832,7045832,14,0,michaelochurch,,,"VC sucks but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend bootstrapping unless you&#x27;re wealthy even by HN terms. (You&#x27;re an angel investor in yourself.)<p>I lost about $300k (opportunity cost) bootstrapping a startup over almost 3 years. I burned up about $100k of savings (finance jobs before that) and was, at the end of it, about $15k in debt and, psychologically, in a really bad place. (It&#x27;s actually pretty amazing that I didn&#x27;t fall harder or sooner, living in NYC on about $3k per month.) Can&#x27;t recommend that. Oh, and because I was the first to leave (because I literally ran out of money) and eat blame, the CEO refused to let me open-source the work I&#x27;d done, out of spite. Two years of what was then cutting-edge Clojure code (that was one awesome thing about the experience, being an early-adopter in Clojure) gone. (Most of it would be out-of-date now; the language has made impressive strides.)<p>Oh, and that Valhalla where after failing at a bootstrapped startup, you get hired as a Staff SWE at Google or an EIR at a venture firm? Doesn&#x27;t fucking exist. Most startups leave your career in worse shape than you&#x27;d be in had you gotten a decent big-company job. (Emphasis on <i>decent</i>. Yes, bad big-company jobs waste your life and career and reputation, but so do bad startups and those are quite common.)<p>The second startup where I worked was VC-funded and paid a low but acceptable (savings-neutral) salary. I was there for 3 months. Hired as VP/Eng but disallowed to use the title (first warning sign) until 6-month point. Asked to sign bogus performance reviews against early joiners with &quot;too much&quot; equity. Refused to do it. Got fired. No severance (I was an idiot and failed to take pictures of the documents I was asked to sign; had I, I&#x27;d probably be a half a million richer). Credit card debt. CEO spent <i>months</i> trying to destroy my reputation. (Combining that with my accurate but politically unwise public commentary about experiences at Google, I had some interesting job interviews.) Ultimately that CEO failed (like at everything in life, except for pulling family connections to raise money for bad ideas) to ruin me and I&#x27;m fine now, but I&#x27;ve been through hell.<p>Observation: in the bootstrapped world, you risk savings. This is not be taken lightly. It&#x27;s not &quot;just money&quot;. The temptation to quit too late might land you in credit card debt or fuck up your family life or something else. Really dangerous. I like the idea of bootstrapping, but I can&#x27;t advise it unless you&#x27;re rich enough to be a genuine angel investor (because that&#x27;s what you are). Getting to that point, savings-wise, usually requires climbing a corporate ladder anyway; at that point, the bootstrapped startup is just a victory lap.<p>In the VC-funded world, on the other hand, you risk <i>reputation</i>. (Whether savings or reputation is worse to lose depends on one&#x27;s personal circumstances; there&#x27;s no globally valid comparison there.) The VCs have set up a tight-knit and utterly feudal reputation economy that exists in spite of its many violations of law, at least in spirit if not in letter (the note-sharing and co-funding culture is fundamentally collusive). VCs won&#x27;t go after your house or your car, but if you cross them, they&#x27;ll destroy your career and reputation. Morally speaking, that&#x27;s even worse.<p>Maybe the truth is that this startup crank being peddled is, to paraphrase George Carlin, Bad for Ya. Or maybe I&#x27;m just a dinosaur at the ripe old age of 30. I don&#x27;t think so. I&#x27;ve seen a lot, I understand technology at a deep level, and I think the startup game is <i>extremely</i> dangerous and the risks are often intentionally hidden. At a Series D startup, you&#x27;ll get some pathetic 0.02% slice because &quot;the business is de-risked&quot;. It&#x27;s true that a startup will never have a true &quot;layoff&quot; (for image reasons, it must appear to be expanding) unless in dire straits, but phony &quot;performance&quot; firings (no severance, and feces all over the target&#x27;s reputation) to hide layoffs are extremely common. Not fucking de-risked at all.<p>People are waking up to the evil of the VC-funded world and its disgusting good-ole-boy network, and the way forward is going to involve bootstrapping. I just don&#x27;t want people to think it&#x27;s a panacea. Like gambling, bootstrapping will not fuck up your life if you can contain your impulses... but if you keep burning savings because &quot;this month is going to be the month I hit&quot; then you can wreck your life even harder than a VC can. Frankly, I&#x27;d rather get a bad reputation in VC-istan (there are other options) than end up $50k in credit card debt.",1389545726

7046470,comment,7045187,7046039,2,0,jheriko,,,"There is quite a distinct difference imo.<p>One certainly could describe html and css as &#x27;declarative&#x27; programming languages in that sense, but I think its a pointless definition then because all data fits that same definition - so why not just call it data?<p>The key thing here is about what is encoded, not what the output is. A C Hello World program encodes a call to printf along with a data string as a piece of executable code in the entry point of some executable format - the fact that printf is a library function is deceptive - because the encoding of that is important too and it describes how to interact with the OS to output text. HTML containing &quot;Hello World&quot; encodes merely the string and gives you no choice of what is done with it - nor can you interact with the OS, the hardware or any of the surrounds without introducing more (e.g. JavaScript).<p>However, the fact that you edit it directly in a text editor makes it coding. I have no disagreements with that at all... but the fact that HTML and CSS are difficult to use data formats doesn&#x27;t qualify them to be &#x27;full&#x27; programming languages imo.<p>As for scorn, I have no scorn towards HTML and CSS because of their perception of being code. I do however have plenty due to the design and real world implementations - not because they are &#x27;easy&#x27;, but in fact they are much harder than they need to be due to a combination of poor design and poor browser implementation. I can qualify that a lot, but its an article of its own I guess... not a comment. :)<p>Any decent programmer should be able to design a superior alternative to HTML and CSS imo.

A lot of us are in environments that feel like they are designed to keep us separated after we enter our professional life. This is particularly true for people that have moved by themselves to a different state or country and basically need to build a social circle from scratch. And this gets more difficult as you grow older.<p>I live in a central European country for four years now and I find it extremely hard to meet new people even for a superficial friendship.<p>- I have very few coworkers, but even if I didn’t, people tend to keep professional and private life very separate here. Some actually think they have “enough” friends and you might never get through to them no matter how much you try.<p>- In my home country I would usually meet people through friends of friends, but here my friends will rarely bring anyone else of their circle when we go out (even when asked).<p>- Meetups are also a big failure for me. Most of the time they involve huge groups that are very impersonal. They involve people that are here for a month up to people that have been here for 20-30 years and have their own cliques within the meetup. The first year I kept going to the same meetup and kept introducing myself to the same (more or less) people and held the same discussion over and over. Each meetup was as if I was there for the first time and needless to say, I didn’t make a single friend from that. Even in the smaller ones, it seems that most participate either to spend a night away from their spouse/“real” friends or just for the activity.<p>- Going up to talk to random strangers is also not very common here, but even if it was, it is unfortunately impossible for me. I feel incredibly self-conscious and uncomfortable. I tried it when I was in the US where people are more open and I honestly hated myself. I doubt PUA literature would help.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t want to be too negative and I also have me to blame for the situation. What I wanted to highlight is that it also depends on the cultural environment and the particular circumstances. To me, it is quite indicative that we have dating websites and meetups and social web sites and whatnot but we are generally more lonely.",1389544811

Why should anyone give their all (in the workplace) to someone who doesn&#x27;t value them? Yes, for practical reasons, you should probably obey laws and basic courtesy without expecting compensation-- not littering is just what you&#x27;re supposed to do, a part of the implicit social contract is using public spaces. But if someone&#x27;s asking for you to commit serious energy or favor, you better make sure you&#x27;re doing it for someone who values you. Otherwise, you&#x27;re wasting your energy, and that&#x27;s quite finite.<p><i>Gen X, growing up before the Internet, interpreted that lesson as putting your head down and getting to work.</i><p>Really? 20 years ago, the reputation (undeserved) of Gen X was that it was a lazy, shiftless, loser generation. Now that they&#x27;re older and have proven themselves, their reputation has improved somewhat. Oh, and every generation for the past 50 years (maybe longer?) has been called a &quot;Me, Me, Me Generation&quot; when it was young.<p><i>First is a gross misunderstanding that things like success, money or happiness come instantly.</i><p>I blame that on the age discrimination culture in most careers (if you&#x27;re not at level X by age Y, you&#x27;re a perma-loser) and, in tech, we see that the get-big-or-die insanity comes from the VCs, not founders. Most Gen-Y&#x27;s/Millennials would be happy to tread water and <i>thrilled</i> to get rich slowly by, say, starting from a solid base, working hard, and improving their pay at 10-20% per year.<p>The impatience comes from the shitty time pressure imposed by age discrimination, volatile housing costs, and the fact that it&#x27;s almost irresponsible to have children given the increasing importance of connections and the (directly related) obscene expense and competitiveness in educational positioning-- that now begins before grad school.<p><i>So if we take the life and death part away, why would we think that we can do our work, check our phones, write a paragraph, send a text, write another paragraph, send another text, without the same damage to our ability to concentrate? Generation Y thinks that, because they have grown up with all these technologies, they are better at multitasking. I would venture to argue they are not better at multitasking.</i><p>First of all, I know that I (and most people) am generally terrible at multitasking. There are specific kinds of multitasking at which people can perform (coming up with creative ideas while walking and listening to music) but, in general, context switches are damaging. I think this issue is environmental: open-plan offices, constant interruptions, and a social climate that just expects high availability. It&#x27;s not one generation&#x27;s fault; it&#x27;s just the way people are becoming.<p><i>Cigarettes are out. Social media is in. It’s the drug of the twenty-first century. (At least people who smoke stand outside together.)</i><p>Silly. When smoking was at its peak it was socially acceptable to do it indoors. What, you think fucking Don Draper is going to stand out in the fucking cold of a Manhattan wind-tunnel January?<p><i>Where alcohol replaced trusting relationships as a coping mechanism for teenagers who grew up to be alcoholics, so too are the positive affirmations we get from social media and the virtual relationships we maintain replacing real trusting relationships as coping mechanisms.</i><p>Alcohol was (and is) used as a low-grade anxiolytic, which it is in low doses for people without a tolerance, that helps people overcome the social anxiety produced cognitive dissonance of a hypercompetitive culture. (Modern medicine offers superior anxiolytics, but those don&#x27;t target social anxiety nearly as well, and physicians frown, for good reason, on recreational use of them. The most powerful non-Rx anxiolytic is probably kava, which makes you sleepy more than sociable. Anyway...)<p><i>I kept meeting amazing, wonderful, smart, driven and optimistic Gen Yers who were either disillusioned with their entry-level jobs or quitting to find a new job that will “allow me to make an impact in the world,” discounting the time and energy that is required to do it.</i><p>Or they were getting fired/laid-off for reasons that weren&#x27;t their fault and (well taught by their Boomer parents) spinning it to sound like it was by their choice, since young people are better to appear flighty (it&#x27;s expected of them) than to suffer the status hit of an involuntary termination. There&#x27;s more than meets the eye in this sort of thing.<p><i>What they seem to fail to notice, however, is the mountain.</i><p>Alternative theory: there are plenty of Gen-Yers scaling that mountain. However, since the eldest in that generation are only in their early 30s, none of those have had any prominence because they&#x27;re still working their way up. Instead, it&#x27;s the lifted pieces of shit like Evan Spiegel and Lucas Duplan getting the attention. Generations always put an unrepresentative foot forward first, because the &quot;successes&quot; are (with very few exceptions) manufactured by their elders.<p><i>According to a 2013 study by the Centers for Disease Control, suicide rates among Baby Boomers rose nearly 30 percent during the past decade, making suicide one of the leading causes of death in that age group, behind only cancer and heart disease. The biggest jump in suicides was among men in their fifties — this age group experienced a whopping 50 percent increase. With the increase of suicides among Boomers, more people now die of suicide than from car accidents.</i><p>Cars and roads are becoming safer (so the &quot;car accident&quot; comparison is not all bad news). Age discrimination is hitting single-income older (50-65) men the hardest right now, so that explains a bit of it. That and health problems explain most of the suicides, I&#x27;d bet. Also, while teenage girls may have the highest suicide attempt rate, men over 50 have always had the highest suicide completion rate.<p><i>The problem is that in twenty to thirty years, when our youngest generation grows up and takes charge of government and business, its members will have grown up using Facebook, prescription drugs or online support groups as their primary coping mechanisms rather than relying on real support groups: biological bonds of friendship and loving relationships.</i><p>Give me a break. This is ludicrous junk science. Most people using &quot;prescription drugs&quot; need them, and people get tired of Facebook fake friendship after, I don&#x27;t know, two or three years. (And there are people for whom Facebook provides a real benefit; by age 60, most of your friends live far away from you, and online contact is better than what was common before the Internet-- dropping off completely.)<p><i>In 1960, the number of notable school shootings was one. In the 1980s there were 27. The 1990s saw 58 school shootings, and from 2000 until 2012 there were 102 school shootings.</i><p>First, those events are getting more coverage now. It&#x27;s worldwide. If something fucked-up happens in Colorado or Connecticut or Norway or Japan, the world will know about it. It seems like violence is becoming more common, but all evidence suggests the reverse. (Also, the worst school massacres aren&#x27;t perpetrated by school students-- see: Bath, Beslan, Newtown-- but by older people.) School shootings are horrible, but in the late 1960s, Americans started worrying about <i>the fucking draft</i> as the Vietnam War ramped up. Does anyone really think that <i>Facebook</i> is going to cause more &quot;antisocial behavior&quot; than an illegal and demoralizing war in Vietnam, into which people were sent involuntarily?

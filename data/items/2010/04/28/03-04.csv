I learned all the print capabilities to make a pretty looking layout on the screen and to get some random information ""just so"".<p>The reason I say this is that I like the idea behind this text, a lot, for people who want to learn from nothing, but I don't think it will hold people's interest for that long.  I keep wondering if they'll just burn out if you're doing nothing but printing out the textual results of logic puzzles.<p>I'm not asking for a video game, in fact, I'm not sure exactly what I'm asking for, but there's got to be a way to light a fire in someone's head the same way it lit in mine when I typed in ""line 32,32 to 32,64"" from the BASIC manual and a red line appeared on the screen... and I realized I could do <i>anything</i> on that screen with the right sequence of commands... <i>anything</i>.<p>(Well, I found out otherwise later... but that's how it felt)<p>(And yeah, I realize getting graphics set up in python sucks for rank beginners... part of the reason I'm not sure exactly what should be done...)",1272426824

Generally, I found both participants have to be extremely focused, have roughly the same skill level, and the code should be worked out on paper before ""iterating."" Otherwise, we ended up arguing over trivialities or bird walks over to youtube in the moments where we both were stumped (more my partner--I'm not a big fan). Long story short, we use pair cowboy programming now with more success. I guess it's all dependent on the cohesion between partners' attitudes towards work; if partners' ethics are different use logical cohesion on a project else use functional cohesion (which is definitely preferred but not always an option). Hope that makes sense, just my limited take on the topic. Does anyone have any success stories with pair programming--I could use the tips!",1272426666

1300631,comment,1294899,1295213,0,0,chbarts,,,"> Of course, Scott Adams has been at this for years and having to come up with a new joke each day for that length of time would be rather challenging.<p>Definitely the case. This comedy degradation happened to <i>Garfield</i> and <i>Peanuts</i> as well, and it hit <i>Peanuts</i> especially hard because, well, it's <i>Schultz.</i> He was doing genius work in the 1950s-1960s, refining a lot of the medium traits we now take for granted.<p>Both <i>Garfield</i> and <i>Dilbert</i> were a lot weirder in their early years, had larger casts, and more diverse settings. In one of the early <i>Dilbert</i> plotlines, he discovers dinosaurs hiding in his home after a computer model tells him they can't <i>all</i> be gone. Not exactly genius, but better than anything Adams is making now.<p>The decline of <i>Peanuts</i> was especially sad. Schultz was a trouper and did the work until he physically and mentally couldn't anymore, and the decline showed painfully. Buying the huge Fantagraphics collection might be beyond your budget, but if you get a chance to flip through it by all means do so.<p>The foregoing illustrates why <i>The Far Side</i> and <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> were ended early. It also illustrates just how resistant to change newspaper readers are: The reason strips are allowed to sit and fester for <i>decades</i> when TV shows are off the air in a few seasons is due entirely to the fact papers will lose circulation if they cut the wrong strip.",1272424647

If you can quickly soak up domain specific knowledge as even an average developer, you're going to be well respected and thought of.  I'm not great at this part, but do well simply by having reasonable communication skills - it's flat out amazing how many tech folks fail based on bad people skills.<p>Honestly though, I think expectations are so low, so often that people are completely willing to put up with really low quality results if they can simply pay bottom dollar for coders.  This ties in with organization culture in any of those environments - it will far and away be the dominant factor in your ability to be successful programming.  If the culture is restrictive or narrow-minded, you'll struggle.<p>Maybe Zed is trying to drive home that there is lot of headcount floating around in tech companies with a job title that would lead you to think they were doing a bunch of development, but they amount to magic TPF report generators.  The other option, and one that I love stumbling into, is that there are some tremendously smart people in those fields he mentions who have taught themselves to code to do cool hacking in the field.  I find that as an ""officially credentialed"" CS type, many of these people have picked up a significant amount of what I spent more than a few years in formal education pursuing.",1272424303

I do the design, write the backend, sell it to the client, do the testing, receive the feedback etc. I think it comes from the fact that I've been doing all of this for almost two decades now. I have spent three times more time fiddling in Paint Shop Pro than professional graphic artists in Photoshop. I may not be able to make designs as pretty as 280North but that doesn't stop me from giving it my best.<p>I've also spent more time and energy configuring Apache and various *nix apps than most sysadmins. But I don't feel comfortable blogging about ""Top 5 Unix commands you must know"" because I always feel there are 100 others who know more than me so I'll let them blog on these topics. I'll blog about what I'm good at or my own experiences. Which brings me back to the do-it-all topic - if it needs to be done, I want to learn how to do it and do it well. I delegate and outsource when I have resources available but if not, I just do whatever needs to be done. Heinlein's quote seems pretty appropriate here:<p>""A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly.

The main problem with the calories in = calories out myth is that they are assumed to be independent variables when they are self-evidently not. When you work out more, your body demands more energy by stimulating appetite. When you eat less than your body needs, you get cold and hungry.<p>The other problem is that it overlooks the role of insulin in weight gain. Insulin is the primary regulator of fat storage, this has been known for 50 years or more. Eating foods that stimulate insulin secretion are going to cause you to put on pounds - that's the job of insulin! If every type of calorie we consume contributes the exact same effect on the body, why do marathoners (or any other athelete for that matter) carb-load before challenges? Why not fat-load because everyone knows that fat has twice as many calories per gram?<p>My main point is that not all types of calories cause the same types of effects.

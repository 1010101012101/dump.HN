387810,comment,387248,387248,0,0,tptacek,,,"I wanted to like Jens' article, as a fellow Rubyist who had left a few 10klocs of Python in his wake. But I thought this was really weak. Instead of coming across like genuine tough questions, I think Jens wears his bias on his shoulder, even commenting that he's been ""tipped more towards Ruby"" by this ""fork in the community"" (a particularly funny comment from a Rubyist).<p>His worst argument: a comment that claims he's worried that Py3k will get security fixes that Python 2.6 won't --- a borderline-irresponsible cheap shot.<p>It's too bad, because I actually agree with his assessment; I get a whiff of ""second-system syndrome"" from this whole Py3k project, and the idea of breaking random bits of code in an interpreted, dynamically typed language and then fixing them with a code translator seems like lunacy.",1228535375

387806,comment,387248,387399,0,0,tptacek,,,"It's a red herring. Py3k is deliberately not a production runtime; it's the ""developers and students"" release Jens said GvR+co should have released instead of Py3k. Crudding the runtime up with performance hacks would cost more than they'd be worth.<p>The Ruby comparison Jens makes is exceedingly disingenuous; Ruby 1.9 is a runtime upgrade, not a major language update. Improving performance is mostly the point of it. And even then, there are areas of Ruby that remain controversial, like the threading model.",1228534932

I'm not talking text link ads but actual sponsorships from key companies in my sector. It's not big money but enough for me to spend my time working on what I want rather than what I have to.<p>In the past, I had revenue generating webapps, but I sold those in order to build some capital for future projects, savings, etc. I should probably get on to building another to be fair..<p>Oh, some low-maintenance Web hosting and domain registrations too for ultra old Web design clients (when I did that sort of thing).

Thatâ€™s how you get explosive momentum. No \n  matter how smart or driven you are, you cannot do it alone.\n</code></pre>\nGroups help give explosive momentum, sure, but when it comes to <i>starting</i> projects or making bold developments, nah. I'm thinking of the precendents set with, say, Linus Torvalds and Linux, Matz and Ruby, or DHH and Rails. It takes the dictatorial ""I'm making all the decisions and getting this to the next step"" approach to really get a project going. Big shifts require hunkering down too - when Parrot and Perl 6 started, there were so few people involved, but they really kicked it off.<p>Of course, the open source world has proven that once you reach a point where you have something useful and not too experimental, it can only improve under the influence of others :)",1228533710

387794,comment,386910,387535,0,0,wheels,,,"They're trying to prove a very different point in that study; notably that for developers working on distributed architectures that it's faster to solve most problems with Erlang than C++.  That's a very different sort of conclusion than saying that the best programmers write the most code.<p>I think the only reasonable metric is someone's portfolio.  You wouldn't pick an architect by how many nails they'd used or a musician by how many notes they'd written.  You have to look at what they've actually done.<p>And in fact, that's pretty close to what good hiring is about.  You then see if real performance matches up to what's in the portfolio.",1228533603

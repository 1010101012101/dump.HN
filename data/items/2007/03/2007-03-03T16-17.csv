2. Use Ajax to 1up points.
3. I have 29 points on my account but I don't know where I got them from. A tracking algo would be appreciated.
4. atm, topics are promoted to front page with just 2 points. Increase this limit in order to attract more worthy content to the ""top"" category.<p>Let me know if you need help with any of these. They probably require less than 20 minutes to implement.",1172940916

1997,comment,1890,1944,0,0,juwo,,,"I really appreciate the advice from you all. To those who posted on this page, I can send you the demos, an executive summary and competitive matrix - if you are interested. IMHO juwo is a useful everyday tool.
However, you would have to give me your word that (sorry, I dont know how to put it diplomatically) you will not rip off any new ideas. 
In return, perhaps, I can share a percentage of any profit from juwo - for a certain time eg. 1 year with those who will help out with concrete help.
There is a lot of money in it if it catches on. Think of youtube using it for their audio/video.
Feel free to email me anil AT juwo DOT com.
thanks,
Anil Philip",1172938596

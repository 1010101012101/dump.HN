But playing devil's advocate, they don't exactly teach a lot of theory to education majors either, let alone those in teachers cert. programs.<p>Personally I decided to put off graduating a few more weeks to take, among other things, a human development course in child cognition because lately I've been wondering how closely the parenting books mirror what's being published in scientific journals. If I learn anything useful then I'll post it at some point in the future.",1200980766
102043,comment,102005,102005,0,0,curi,,,"The more fundamental problem with colleges is they have no idea how to help people learn. And don't even think that's what they should be doing. No, they want to ""teach"" students, by which they mean force them to listen to lectures, whether they are interested and learning or not, and force them to do work whether it helps them individually or not, and force them to take tests to make sure they obeyed.",1200980160
102042,comment,101964,101964,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Homeschooling might be great, but if the author finds it insulting when people suggest they can't teach early grades because the material is so easy it makes me worry that they know nothing about education. I don't think successfully educating young kids has a lot to do with knowing the material or not, past a certain level of familiarity anyway.",1200979892

As I said on your previous comment, I wrote the post in response to someone asking about quitting their job.<p>I definitely agree that people asking for random advice on YC about tiptoeing in may be in trouble when problems occur, and they will occur early in the startup.<p>I'm having the 2 month problems now. If I would have quit my job when I was overly excited earlier in the journey I would be facing some seriously hard times.<p>Goodluck :)",1200979826

Especially since I don't want to convince everyone I know to switch from LinkedIn, etc."".<p>It seems like your answer is that trust is weighted by how much you trust someone.<p>However, that isn't clear without some digging. Certainly, that point is more important than the ""thumbs-up"" people, yet the ""thumbs-up""  people are more visible (and annoying).<p>A couple other questions -<p>- I'd still need to be sold on getting people I know to sign up - maybe there's some way to piggyback off of existing networks?<p>- Just because I trust someone in one area doesn't mean I trust them in others. For instance, someone may be a fantastic lawyer, but just because they recommend a developer does not mean I think they're competent to rate developers.<p>- The tagline, ""Your credibility, online"" strikes me as a little much. For one thing, the idea of trusting my credibility to a single site gives me the heebie-jeebies. Fortunately, that's not the case, credibility cannot exist in a single database, and thinking about that drives home that the tagline may be overstating it a bit.<p>- I really dig that the registration form is minimal, but it makes me wonder how to distinguish multiple people with the same name.",1200979182

Don't stop practicing -- you can't get anywhere without practice.<p>If you're curious about CS you should just go ahead and read SICP. I recommend the printed version, but the whole thing is online here:<p><a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/</a><p>Perhaps there are people who love CS and yet hate this book, but I have yet to meet one. It's not the easiest book in the world, but it is the real thing, and not an imitation.<p>There are, of course, lots of things you could learn which are not exactly ""CS"" but which will make you a better web programmer. Study SQL. Study emacs (read Steve Yegge for inspiration) or another killer editor. Learn to use a really decent version control system (the SVN book -- just google ""SVN book"" to find it -- is easy to understand, but Linus Torvalds is right when he claims that Git is much nicer!) Read ""Mastering Regular Expressions"". Read Bruce Eckel's <i>Thinking in Java</i> so that you know enough about the world's most popular language to understand where it sucks, ;) and so that you can follow the conversation of much of the rest of the software world. Read K&R.",1200978895

Your project slips 6 months because you were dead wood during dev and QA while you learned Rails, and you just fucked over everyone else whose bonus and raise depended on the project.<p>We don't have to argue about this because I think we agree.<p>The more important point is, if you need to come up with an elaborate plan to figure out to engage your new company, you  haven't figured out what your new company is. There's a YC meme going around here, along the lines of ""is now a good time to start my company?"" or ""what's the best way to smoothly transition into my new startup?"". None of that means shit. 2 months into your startup you are going to face some problem that is going to be an existential threat to your project, and it's all going to go badly, and you're going to have to figure out how to work through it anyways, and all this talk about how to ""start the startup"" and ""milk your last job"" is going to sound pretty silly.",1200978811

Most people take care of personal business or watch funny videos on company time. Nobody works 8 hours straight.<p>We are describing 2 different employment situations. You are picturing a team environment where everyone has to carry the load to reach a common goal that you feel is meaningful, I'm not. The job I'm thinking of is more like Fight Club or Office Space.<p>People that have truly team oriented employment where coworkers are working towards a worthwhile goal are less likely to be jumping ship for a startup.<p>It can be a dick move to the company, but I've seen companies treat people a lot worse.",1200978479

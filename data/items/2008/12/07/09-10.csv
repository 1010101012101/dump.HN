The only way to access another web app through a web app is to go through the server, which means the user has to give web app A his account+password for web app B.<p>With Twitter tools we see one possible solution: all twitter tools I have seen (like twitpic or twitterfeed) just ask you for your twitter password. People seem to happily use it, but I would guess it is only because they don't think their Twitter account is very valuable. Try doing the same for ebay, though?<p>I guess at least web apps should provide a way for users to generate ""secondary access"" to their accounts (like on FLickr you can share certain photosets, but not others). But few do, so it is not a universal solution.<p>Or maybe people just have to learn to trust?",1228643854

388804,comment,388420,388420,0,0,jbert,,,"re: performance, any smtp mail server worth its salt will be limited by I/O write performance (email should be sync'd to stable storage before signalling acceptance). CPU spent pushing data over pipes/unix sockets won't register. I don't see any measurements in there, so it sounds like ""X Windows is slow because it has to talk over a socket"" analysis.<p>""The short version: Classes and methods beats pipes and processes.""<p>Well, it depends. For latency on when processing a single large email, yes, perhaps. One-pass processing will give you that (although I think he skipped over how SoS manages to hand off incoming email to SpamAssassin without ""passing it over a pipe to a perl process"")? Surely we are trying to compare like with like, right?<p>But mail processing is a parallel activity. Reducing latency on a single message is not the same thing as improving throughput. What do we find out about that?<p>""But, sendmail and postfix are still way better at huge scale bulk, so it relays to them.""<p>Ah, OK. So this is a boutique solution, for personalised handling of small-site stuff. Guess what? We already have that, since (as noted by the spamassassin example) you can set up the big solutions to hand off a message to you to process in the language of your choice.<p>Sorry for -ve rant. I didn't see any -ve comments in this section and wanted a little critical balance. Nice software is always nice, and you don't have to have a reason to want to write it.<p>But I don't like unjustified justifications. If you're going to claim better performance, give numbers.",1228643366
388803,comment,388420,388420,0,0,gaius,,,"Interesting. I wrote something very much like this for internal use at my company. Basically we have a lot of legacy alerts and messages and reports that are ""dumb"" (i.e. if a cron job runs once a minute to detect problems within one minute it will keep on mailing until it's fixed because it has no state) so the new mail system sits in front of it all and says, hmm, saw that a minute ago, won't bother the humans with it again, they're probably busy actually fixing it.<p>It's not, and never will be, a general purpose mail server - old-fashioned SMTP servers have their flaws but it's as good as it gets if you want mail that can reach anyone, anywhere.",1228642621

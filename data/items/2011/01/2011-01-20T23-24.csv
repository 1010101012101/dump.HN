With this change, it should give more control back to the founders while still keeping the excellent business decisions Schmidt has made in the loop.",1295567974

There are a million spammers and lazy businesses out there who would simply LOVE to be able to use Craigslist as their own personal ad bucket. Craig even calls them out specifically in the TOU as ""third-party posting services.""<p>Padmapper and similar can do their job with RSS feeds and occasional callbacks to see if ads are still alive, which I think alleviates a majority of load concerns. One area in which Craigslist has moved to shut down Craigslist search engines is where services have implemented multi-location search for sales items, which violates the Craigslist maxim of connecting people locally and introduces shipping and payment complications (Paypal) that they'd rather not be in the middle of. That Padmapper deals with a part of Craigslist that is necessarily localized may be their saving grace.",1295567420

2125801,comment,2125251,2125309,0,0,CurrentB,,,"Yeah I think you're grossly underestimating the success of Android, and confusing the genius of the two separate operating systems with bifurcation. Android was a BRILLIANTLY timed play that stopped an Apple monopoly in modern smartphones in its tracks. Just think for a second what the current mobile landscape would look like had android not come out exactly within the quarter that it did.<p>While we have yet to see the effects of ChromeOS, its release will no doubt be massively disruptive, and the ability to recognize the different functionality both operating systems serve and launch both consecutively despite the fact that it looks like a very odd play to the naive masses, takes balls and isn't something I would say ANY other company even a twentieth the size of Google would attempt, and I predict this will pay off in the end.<p>I also disagree that Wave, TV and Buzz lacked discipline and oversight. Not everything a company can do is going to be a revolutionary success. A lot of times markets just need to be probed or explored, and if there's a hit great but if not there's no huge loss of resources and returns will still be made in some form or another (eg. wave code being reused in Docs or buzz maybe showing up as part of another social product in the future). For Google TV in particular, it really hasn't been outperformed significantly by competitors, and really the world just isn't ready for that type of media. But when it is Google will be there.<p>I mean, I don't know Shcmidt's exact role in all these products but sometimes I think people are too quick to dismiss the Google products that don't live up to the expectations of Gmail, Maps, etc, when really they are minuscule investments by the company among many others, and even if one in ten is the next Gmail then that's a damn solid business model.",1295566838

Getting this in front of the right people, and, having it understood by those people is going to be the key.  While the actual deployment will be left to someone probably more savvy, you have to sell the businessman (or businesswoman) that may not be as technically literate, why he would do this.",1295564966

They identified some performance issues. Narrowed it down to a jQuery version but just left it there.<p>jQuery is open source so they could have done some investigating on their own and tried to narrow down what changed in that selector. Especially since this change was blogged about (as mentioned by John).<p>Not to mention various people helped out twitter by finding some pretty obvious flaws and made suggestions. Twitter has a lot of resources and I'm assuming a lot of talented Javascript engineers. This is a situation where they could have used their resources to contribute to an open source project instead of the other way around.",1295564932

I try not to let my mind wander and just focus on the plant and my breathing, and make sure to relax when I notice muscular tension anywhere.  That's it!  That's meditation, as far as I'm concerned.  Totally worth it!  My ability to notice stress and shut it off during the day has gone way up.  When I get flustered at work I conjure up the dracaena in my mind's eye for an instant and get everything under control.<p>The bit of literature that turned me on to the ""meditation"" practice is this:

It teaches you to filter less of the info your senses are continuously delivering to your brain, and be more aware of every sensation.<p>What's the point, you ask? Well, beyond the obvious benefits of being more aware of physical sensations, in the process of disciplining your mind, you find out a lot about yourself -- what issues in your life are constantly distracting you from the task at hand, etc.<p>This only works when you starve your mind of new distractions -- hence, no talking, writing, reading, or even eye contact during the 10 days. It's a lot of time, I know, but for me it was well worth it.",1295564430

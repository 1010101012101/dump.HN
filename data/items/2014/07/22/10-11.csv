But you&#x27;re only as fast as your slowest bottleneck and all the current cloud solutions have fundamental performance or capacity limits we run into.<p>Could you do it well if building for the cloud from day one? Yeah sure, I think so. Could you consistency render all your pages performing several up to date queries and cache fetches across that cloud network you don&#x27;t control and getting sub 50ms render times? Well that&#x27;s another matter, and unless you&#x27;re talking about <i>substantially</i> higher cost (at least 3-4x), the answer is no - it&#x27;s still more economical for us to host our own servers.<p>And yes I realize that&#x27;s a fun claim to make without detail. As soon as I get a free day (I think there&#x27;s one scheduled in 2017 somewhere), I&#x27;ll get with George to do another estimate of what AWS and Azure would cost and what bottlenecks they each have.<p>Nick Craver - Stack Exchange Sysadmin & Developer",1406026606
8068270,comment,8067834,8068210,2,0,DCKing,,,"> FP doesn&#x27;t quite work because UI programmers like to think in terms of buttons and windows rather than f and g.<p>This is because people have been educated in thinking in objects for thirty years now. This is again a result of history, not because of the qualities of OO over FP.<p>Besides, there&#x27;s no reason why you couldn&#x27;t do that using functional programming. FP is not (necessarily) object oriented, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you cannot reason about &#x27;objects&#x27; in a different sense.<p>> As someone who works in a distributed systems team, ha! Where are these functional programmers writing high performance parallel code? Microsoft? Google? Facebook? Maybe map reduce and some pipeline descriptions can count as functional but that&#x27;s about it (even the UDFs are imperative).<p>I&#x27;m not talking &quot;distributed&quot; systems that do HPC work; functional programming in general cannot achieve that level of low-level performance (as long as you don&#x27;t count Rust&#x27;s ambitions). I&#x27;m talking &#x27;scalable&#x27; systems that do a lot of messaging processing (like web services and queueing systems). Twitter, Walmart, LinkedIn (Scala), Facebook, Whatsapp, dozens of companies in the telecom industry (Erlang) and Jane Street (Haskell, OCaml, F#) are examples.",1406026570

We are developing desktop, mobile and mostly web applications for well-known clients across the globe.<p>I am currently working on a huge (for us anyway) web project with 100+ people actively developing every corner of our infrastucture.<p>So my day is like:\nArriving at the office around 08:30-09:00. On Tuesdays I have an inhouse English training with a native speaker, which means a couple of guys just talking about kind of everything.<p>After arriving/English training, I get myself something to drink from the kitchen, turn my workstation on and check on my mails which are typically not many, so I got through them under a minute. I fire up my dropdown console to fetch the latest changes on our develop branch (we use Git and GitHub), log into our issue tracking system and into the CMS we are using.<p>After that I start working on any task I have assigned to me. I put on my headphones, open Spotify, select a neat album I like at the moment and off we go to Sublime and Eclipse-lands.<p>I interact with testers, UI guys, squad leads, technical architects and other backend guys regularly via Skype. Our team consists of fellow Hungarians, British-Indians, Frenchmen and Belorussians, so it is pretty diverse.\nMy day is usually about implementing new features and handing them over to the QA guys when done. We have a standup meeting at 2 PM when the team discusses the status of the stories which are in the scope of our current iteration.<p>We have a lot of fun during the day, joking around while coding. I always bump into coworkers in the hallway or in the kitchen and we usually have a little discussion.<p>On Thursdays we have a so-called &quot;Beer Lesson&quot; at a local pub where a couple of guys from the office and anyone interested get together to have some drinks and speak English only with the guidance of our English &quot;teacher&quot;.",1406026568

We are logging the traffic on the port 80 front end they feed. We have tuned the performance there via best practices and taking into account <i>very</i> recent HAProxy changes for various SSL windows added by Willy, Emeric and help from Ilya Grigorik. They&#x27;re all awesome and tremendously helpful. We are on a version slightly newer than 1.5.2 (we build straight from the repo).<p>Even with all that SSL we&#x27;re only running around 15% CPU at peak so it&#x27;s not having any trouble. Most of that CPU usage does come from the SSL termination though - it ran around 3-5% CPU before. We&#x27;re also working on much larger infrastructure changes that mean SSL termination much more local to our users, which means the HAProxy load will drop to just about nothing again. I&#x27;m working on a followup to my previous SSL post: <a href=""http://nickcraver.com/blog/2013/04/23/stackoverflow-com-the-road-to-ssl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nickcraver.com/blog/2013/04/23/stackoverflow-com-the-...</a> that will explain why it&#x27;s not already on for all hits...I think hacker news will have fun with hat one.<p>All that being said, there&#x27;s no reason we can&#x27;t forward that syslog traffic from the listeners to our logging infrastructure to get at least a counter out of it. If you&#x27;re curious how we log, I&#x27;ll explain a bit.<p>We feed it into a logging display called Realog built by Kyle Brandt and Matt Jibson in Go. Here are a few snapshots of the dashboard: <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/OIqhm.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.stack.imgur.com/OIqhm.png</a> <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/iQOP9.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.stack.imgur.com/iQOP9.png</a> <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/bfpUb.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.stack.imgur.com/bfpUb.png</a> <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/JZNy6.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.stack.imgur.com/JZNy6.png</a><p>This lets us forward on custom headers to logging that the web servers are sending back. It tells us how much time we spent in SQL, redis, etc. We can graph it (bottom of the first link) and identify the root cause of any issues faster. It also handles parsing of that traffic from the syslog entry already, so we use it as a single logging point from HAProxy and it handles the JSON generation to forward that traffic data into logstash (a 300 TB cluster we&#x27;re working on setting up right now).<p>As soon as we get the logstash piece working well and dogfooded thoroughly, I&#x27;ll poke Kyle to open source Realog so hopefully some others can get use from it.<p>Nick Craver - Stack Exchange Sysadmin & Developer",1406026062

There are things in the ecosystem that annoy me more.<p>We use Java in a non-standard environment: products built on a enterprise Linux distribution, and therefore built using the same infrastructure and conventions: everything is built from source as a dependency chain, so that you can patch it and provide support, and ship those patched components back as packages. Everything is built in a repeatable environment, jailed in a VM, no network, that only contains the dependencies you declared.<p>So there were those nice times where building a Java library meant packaging 2 or 3 dependencies, then packaging the library was as simple as unpacking, apply any patches, set the classpath to the dependencies and run ant. Then install the resulting jar. It played well with the environment.<p>Java build tools are insane.<p>To build most libraries I now need Maven. Maven needs like a hundred dependencies to build, plus some plugins that need those dependencies, and those plugins build with Maven, the dependencies too.\nAt the end, to build Maven, you need to have all components which are the reason you are building Maven in the first place.<p>So this makes me thing Java developers don&#x27;t think in terms of layers, and they pull dependencies without balancing the costs (writing one function vs depending on 20 more jars).<p>A build tool should have almost no dependencies outside of the base system (in this case the JDK) and the compiler.<p>But no, they added even a Dependency Injection container. And now they realized that the one from Google is better, so they switch to it, but without removing the old. So now they may be depend on 150 packages instead of 100. Great. Lets add more stuff.<p>Imagine if to build make you need to have Gtk, and a library that builds with cmake and another library that builds with scons.<p>And all the noise with this advanced nuclear engines and frameworks to power something as simple as a build tools is at the end useless. At some point the project still declares  technical bankruptcy and dies. Java has a lot of &quot;choice&quot; in terms of libraries, but a good percentage of them are dead projects.",1406025094

Functional programming has only been discovered as a practical paradigm quite recently! Besides, implying that &quot;big serious programs&quot; necessarily implies that they are UI programs is completely wrong.<p>Unsurpisingly, if a given JS UI framework is OO, it is not OO in the traditional sense because JavaScript itself is not OO in the traditional sense. If you make a framework, you use the language of whatever runtime you are targeting.<p>Functional programming is often used to write server code that must easily parallelize and scale across cores, CPUs and clusters. Mostly because the FP paradigm is more obviously advantageous in that setting, but also because those services have less baggage of trends than UI heavy programs do.<p>So you are arguing that there is some perceived evidence for OO in UI programming, but I think that could more easily be attributed to historical trends.

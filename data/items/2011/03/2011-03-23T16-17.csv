2360220,comment,2359319,2360181,0,0,ekanes,,,"I remember when I worked delivering Chinese food, waiting in an intersection to turn left.  A police officer was sitting at the light across the street from me.  I saw him, turned left and he promptly pulled me over.  Turned out there was no left turn at that time of day. I was stunned that he watched me do it and then gave me a ticket rather than warn me, but my care about left turns was much higher because of it.  He changed my lifelong behaviour because there was a real consequence (a ticket was very costly to me then at minimum wage).  If he'd honked to warn me, I doubt I'd even remember the incident.<p>About income from tickets vs safety, catching people who are in the act this way is both.  It's not like they get the ticket and then let them drive away.  When you catch and prevent someone from driving drunk you improve safety as well.",1300899596

Intel's x86 chips have a lot of logic onboard that will optimize code as it's running, in real-time.  Itanium uses all of its silicon to do whatever it's told <i>really, really fast</i> and just trusts that the compiler has figured out all the optimizations ahead of time.  Also, it has mountains of cache memory, so that helps too :)",1300899591

I have never heard of anyone trying to do the same in software, but it would be interesting.<p>Here's how it works:<p>for each statement in your code, break it, then run your entire test suite. If none of your tests have uncovered a problem, mark the code as uncovered. Repeat for each code statement.<p>It's crazily expensive to compute, but it's so much more accurate than to say that a line of code was hit or not.

2360213,comment,2359216,2359382,0,0,qaexl,,,"I did the same thing until Rails 3 came out -- skipping controller and view tests completely. Now I do Rack-level tests, at least for the non-HTML endpoints. If they are using standard REST conventions, they are even easier to test. I send Rack HTTP request, I get back Rack HTTP response. I test the JSON/XML coming out.<p>Considering that ""web apps"" in the future will really mean ""mobile apps"", I think in the future Rails will mostly drive endpoints and barely serve dynamically-generated HTML, most of the views being constructed out of Javascript/HTML on the browser end. Testing to see that data gets applied to the right DOM element will be easier on the browser side (or even with a fake Node.js browser) if the mocking is done there. I suspect that isolating the views properly from the rest of the app will make the whole stack easier to test and maintain.

It's the kind of system that would really benefit from TDD but it's not practical to cover all the code that would be affected.  There would be no substitute for a thorough round of acceptance testing and whack-a-mole trolling for bugs.<p>So my manager and I have to make a call about the benefits and risks of this work,  which in turn connects to project management issues.  I wouldn't want to do this late in the schedule,  but would feel more comfortable doing it early.  At certain times I might be able to do this work and have very little impact on other developers but at other times it could impair their ability to do work.  (Yes,  intelligent use of version control could help a lot here,  but that takes coordination with the team.)<p>The point is that it's a team effort.  There are some cleanups which are easy and low risk and you should go right ahead and do.

At least, when I was there Core OS had a reputation as being the more ""academic"" and ""by the book"" group. That's compared to Frameworks, which was much more pragmatic than dogmatic. One of the things I admired was how Bertrand managed those conflicting viewpoints with some grace. Of course, things being what they were, I'd expect someone from Core OS to blame Bertrand for being too ""old fashioned"". At the same time I know plenty of people from Frameworks who were upset that he ""adopted new technology too soon""…there was especially a lot of that with respect to libdispatch.<p>As for malloc, I find it hard to believe that he was stubborn about changes. The one chance I had to sit and have coffee with Bertrand, we discussed what API's we'd most like to rewrite given infinite time/resources. His answer was ""malloc"". I think rather than being stuck with the last technology, he had a difficult time balancing the pressures of change with the need for consistence, and did so admirably.<p>Oh, and as for top…when they <i>did</i> change it in early SnowLeopard builds, it broke a whole host of tooling, etc., and they had to revert some changes...",1300899287

Even if it's true (and I'm not sure that it is, despite much ado to the contrary) that redistribution will create a class of people that ""rely on government handouts,"" it isn't clear that that's a bad thing, at least as long as the ""handouts"" are understood to be things like food stamps and welfare checks.  No one is getting rich off those.

That's just <i>staggering</i>.<p>For almost all of human history we've only had to deal with issues of growth. There are of course exceptions to this. Some cities that were massive are either small now or have ceased to exist. Some (like London) went through centuries of virtual depopulation before being reborn (between the Roman departure and the 10th-11th century).<p>But modern city depopulation seems to create some fairly big problems. Cities with significant depopulation (eg Detroit, Baltimore) are known for crime. Some say this causes the depopulation, which may well be true, but it also exacerbates it, as drug addicts and the like move into decaying and abandoned areas.<p>Going forward, this is going to be a significant problem we'll have to deal with, I believe. The reason I believe that is that it is my opinion that there are simply too many people on this planet. Ultimately it's unsustainable. Either we'll solve this by breeding less or nature will do it for us.<p>Either way, if this comes to pass, we'll need to figure out how to shrink urban centers effectively. That's going to be painful.<p>As for Detroit, it's certainly well off its peak in the 50s and 60s. It may be cheap (and thus, arguably, attractive to investors) but it's cheap for a reason.

You can possibly have good code without unit tests.  You can, more importantly, have awful code <i>with</i> unit tests.<p>For me, a major axis of ""good"" for code is maintainability.  Therefore, writing good code means spending some time considering names rather than just using the first ones that pop into your head as you type.  It means thinking about whether these superficially similar pieces of code are really related enough for code reuse to be beneficial, or whether it's only incidental similarity and really should exist in both places independently in your codebase.  It's about writing small pieces of functionality yourself when otherwise you'd drop in a library that dwarfs your written code -- sure, dropping in the library is fast and easy, but if something goes wrong, you're now debugging 100K lines of someone else's code instead of the 1K lines of in-house code it would have taken to do just what you needed...<p>Writing good code in this way often takes considerably longer than just cranking out something that works for now, and the largest factor is not time to write unit tests, but time to <i>think</i> about what you're doing rather than coding at the speed you can type.",1300898276

Because the wealthiest 10% paying a larger share of the <i>total</i> taxes is compatible with each of those wealthy individuals paying a relatively small <i>individual percentage</i> of their income in taxes (compared to their peers in other countries).  This happens precisely when a country has a high level of income inequality and a relatively less progressive tax structure.  In such countries, the richest own more of the wealth, giving a higher numerator; they pay a larger share of total taxes due to the fact that (in comparison to more equal countries) their incomes are much higher compared to the incomes of the other 90%; yet the richest 10% pay a lower percentage of their income relative to their peers in other countries because the tax system is less progressive than in other countries.<p>So it's not correct to say that Sweden and Norway do not have progressive tax structures with respect to the richest 10%, while the U.S. does.  Norway's top tax rate is 47%; Sweden's is 59%; the U.S.'s is 35%, plus up to 10% in state income tax, for a max of 45%. [1]<p>> Me - I don't care what someone else has, aka envy. I care what I have, aka greed.<p>This attitude strikes me as naive.  Much of ""what you have"" is only valuable relative to what others have.  This is especially true of cash, but also true of illiquid goods that you value at least partly for their social function or status.  Would driving a Porsche (say) be exactly as valuable to you whether or not everyone else had one?

The data shows that drunk drivers kill more people than sober drivers.<p>About the rest of your post, no downvote from me, you make a great point. You're right that society treats drunk driving as worse, but don't forget that texting while driving is a (relatively) new problem.  Drunk driving used to be fine by society, and then values changed. Texting while driving is now undergoing a similar change, we're just much earlier in the process.<p>In principle you're right though, if texting while driving kills people (and it does) then we should treat that as aggressively as drunk driving.<p>Perhaps the difference here is that you can camp a bar, whereas it's harder to camp texters. ;)",1300897202

You could argue the opposite just as successfully...""<p>Only with a heaping helping of wishful thinking. In the real world, when a currency incurs previously-nonexistent liabilities (in the accounting sense) the reaction of people isn't going to be piling in even faster. It may not kill BitCoin but it isn't going to be a moment where the value rises.<p>""And the ""bitcoin = domestic terrorism"" attack is quite hilarious (in it's futility)""<p>For the record, I disagree with the argument that alternative currencies are solely for money laundering or terrorism (note you added the terrorism connection, I just mentioned money laundering). I'm simply saying the government may make it. If you're going to be paranoid and cynical, do it right. If the government perceives BitCoin as a threat to its power, it isn't just going to come out one day and say ""We perceive BitCoin as a threat to our power and so we're going to just stomp it out."" They're going to have some reason with vague plausibility for enough people to give them cover to do what they want. (In fact I think that there may not even necessarily be any one person who thinks to themselves <i>BitCoin is a threat to the dominance of the US Government and we must come up with some pretext to stomp it out</i>, these things can sort of emerge from the successfully-evolved system itself.)<p>I actually approve of alternate currencies and expect that they will exist in the future regardless of what governments say. I think the embryonic versions already exist and the technological trend is unstoppable. I just don't think BitCoin is it, as it is today. Someone pointed out to me that someone could take BitCoin and actually <i>provide</i> some sort of backing, and I think that would be a potent combo, though given the ""men with guns"" option isn't really available that seems to only leave physical assets, which is tricky to pull off at scale. (You would need to actually be ready to provide all the physical assets if there is a run on the currency, no excuses, no clever contractual ""no we didn't really mean it"", you actually have to have it. Perhaps ironically, if you can, you may never have to, but if you can't, you will certainly have to.) If there's some sort of third option, someone might be able to actually provide the recursive base case and put BitCoin on a firm footing.",1300897174

Although I use Reddit as a comparison more than HN, and the scope goes further than a Reddit/HN clone, that's a big part of it.<p>If you're interested in looking at what I'm doing, it's all open source.  See:<p>(project site):<p><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/neddick"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/neddick</a><p>(Github repo):<p><a href=""http://github.com/fogbeam/Neddick"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/fogbeam/Neddick</a><p>(demo site):<p><a href=""http://spdemo.fogbeam.org:8080/neddick1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spdemo.fogbeam.org:8080/neddick1/</a><p>(warning: the demo site can be abysmally slow at times, but I'm not promoting this real heavily yet, so I haven't put a lot of effort into make the demo real stable and performant.)<p><i>2. karma points (reward for being active and a way to find out what is more interesting - like on HN)</i><p>That and any notion of ""gamification"" is one thing I haven't done much with yet. I'm still undecided on the extent to which it has value in an organizational setting.<p>My approach is also less Quora like (I started before I discovered Quora, or maybe there would be more of a Quora influence), and is more like Reddit.  But I'm working on another piece that I've been describing as a ""sort of mini ""Facebook"" that will deal with managing social graph connections, and will have support of more of an ""activity stream"" type of thing.. I'm envisioning a very pub/sub model where you can subscribe to ""things"" you find interesting, whether that means ""subscribe to this tag"" or ""subscribe to updates from this app"" or ""subscribe to status updates from this user,"" etc.",1300896323
2359954,comment,2359319,2359921,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"When I drink, I stay home.<p>Contrary to popular libertarian thought, I'm happy with new laws as long as they are consistent. If we want to do things to reduce risk of death while driving I don't especially like having government rules, but I'll take them as long as they are self-consistent.<p>The thing with drinking and driving is that, contrary to popular belief, you don't drink four beers and go run over a school bus full of orphans. Most drunk people drive fine for hundreds of trips.<p>What the actual situation is that drinking increases your <i>odds</i> of having an accident. It does not make it a certainty. Not by any means.<p>So as long as we equally prosecute all of those things that increases the odds of having an accident by the same percentage by the same punishment, I'm happy with a compromise. That means cell phone usage, arguing while speeding, etc. If it's as dangerous as X and society needs to intervene, it's as dangerous as X.<p>Of course, framing the issue this way brings up the great problem with DUI -- it's an emotional, moral issue that somebody wants the law to fix. We are ""offended"" by the drunk driver running over the orphan in a way that we are not by the cell phone user doing the same thing.<p>When people talk about ""legislating morality"", they are not talking about pulling words from some holy book and trying to make a constitutional amendment out of it. I wish that it were so simple. Instead, it happens when people of all faiths, including atheists, become morally outraged at some sort of behavior and seek to punish it in a way different from other behavior with similar effects on society.<p>I'll probably get downvoted into oblivion for this comment, but all I'm pleading for is a little dispassionate logic here. I fully understand this is a very emotional issue for lots of people. (And I sympathize with those people) In no way at all do I condone drinking and driving.",1300896274

It was my seed idea, but my contribution was on the design/UI end. We applied to YC fall 2010, and were rejected (rightfully so, in retrospect). My previous coding experience entails a bit of Fortran from undergrad research, and building a couple of simple websites (Frontpage even. o-O). Anyway, I had tons of energy for the project, but lamented not being able to contribute to coding, where it was badly needed. After that experience, I resolved to teach myself something, so I could at least build a MVP, and not depend on anyone else to launch it.<p>I’ve been a redditor since near the beginning, and I’ve been on HN for about a year now. I have many ideas for these types of community sites, and (unlike many who lament the clones) think there remains a lot of potential in this space. As a result, about three months ago, I got news.arc, put it on Linode, and started to try to figure things out. The results of my efforts to date are Hubski, a general site for thoughtful sharing and discussion.<p>A number of my ideas are for Hubski have been implemented, some are not. Here are some that are:<p>Tags: each submission can have a hashtag. These are organic, the submitters choose. You can click a tag, and it will sort out submissions with that tag.<p>Following: You can follow users. The submissions of these users go into your ‘hubfeed’, your personalized version of the site. You can also follow hashtags. Submissions with those tags are put into your hubfeed, regardless of the author.<p>Scoring and voting: Karma is a currency. When you vote up or down, it costs karma, which gets converted to clout. Clout cannot be spent. Everyday you get a small bit of karma. This daily portion increases as your clout and number of followers does.<p>Hubs: The stream of someone’s submissions looks kind of like a blog. It may even more so over time if it seems to make sense from usage. I even imagine Hubski could be used as a blog eventually. I have more thoughts along those lines. I’ve enabled image embedding, to see how it works. I’m going to do the same for video.<p>There are a number of smaller changes as well, such as tabs (opens 2 tabs, the url and the comment page), hovertext (hover over a title while logged in), and some others.<p>I have much more planned, but from here on out I want to implement further changes to be a bit more informed by usage. Also, I am learning, so it takes extra time.<p>I know that this won’t be my last app, (I have designs for a completely original one) but it’s my plan to maintain and evolve Hubski going forward. I’ve been using it with my wife and some good friends, and it is serving a need that I have.<p>BTW, I want to thank the folks in the Arc forum who have been really friendly and helpful to someone as green as myself.<p>Any feedback is greatly appreciated, especially if you can take the time to bounce around the site. Who knows, maybe pg will find it worthwhile to try a hubski function or two on HN. :)",1300896013

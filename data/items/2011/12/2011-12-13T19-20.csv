3348953,comment,3347457,3348645,4,0,fleitz,,,"Some compiled languages are faster, some aren't. Speed of execution is largely related to the optimizations the interpreter / compiler can do, and in many practical cases the qualities of the default library. The other problem is that many interpreted languages are implemented in C leading to the usual performance implications of inner-platform effect. Another problem is the underlying CPU architecture, the vast majority of CPUs are designed to execute C-like languages.",1323806368

3348950,comment,3347828,3348863,9,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Just guessing what type of stuff you do, and also guessing how the organization at Amazon is set up, many times the guys at some level really do want to know where things went haywire. The problem is that they farm out this support work with scripted callers and such limited options for a real conversation that you've effectively shot yourself in the foot (if not shot your entire leg off)<p>At some high level of abstraction, 50-thousand-feet or so, the message is ""support work is overhead which does not directly effect the structure of operations. Their job is to run the business machine that we've created. So we'll cost this as any other overhead, find the cheapest, best way of providing it, and do the correct thing.""<p>But the problem is that anytime anybody talks to the customers, there is all sorts of information exchanging that's not in some policy book. This nuanced and in some cases subtly-patterned information is extremely difficult to manage in a traditional fashion. In this case, the message from Amazon is clear: we do not trust you, we will not tell you why, and we will never do business with you again. While that's a great message for Sammy Spambot and his legion of Makov-chain-generated ebooks, it really sucks for all those false-positives real human beings sitting in their living rooms trying to make buck during a tough recession.<p>So yes, I can understand very well that people in every business want systems that self-correct, and put in places ways for that to happen. The problem is that for all their good intentions, the end result for most of them is a structure that's rigid and communicates important customer opinion data poorly. But it's created that way usually for what seems like very good reasons. We have met the enemy and he is us.",1323806308

3348943,story,,,2,2,Ritu,"Ask HN: Are we lacking simplicity cause everyone wants to do it all?",,"We all want to build something. However, it seems there is a trend to make everything ""feature rich"" these days. For example: I find sites such as LinkedIn, Facebook, etc. extremely confusing. There seems to be a lack of what the core service of a company is. In my opinion it's best to offer one feature and do it really well, revise and make it even better rather than offer million features. For example: if there is a popular ice cream parlor I will keep going there to buy ice cream but if they start offering hot dogs, that may not be my thing. Why add cost when there isn't a need to? Why not offer more ice cream variety.<p>With all that said - I have been contemplating in creating a platform for businesses where small business/freelancers and clients can come together without all the bells and whistles. Not a social network as I think we already have too many and once that are out there are squeezing every ounce of it. A simple platform that lets the customers do the talking for the businesses they have worked with. If a customer is satisfied with what you have they are the best marketing team you will ever have. The platform revolves around that concept.<p>Anyway, what are your thoughts on ""feature rich"" platforms? Is more always better?",1323806146

  Geeks & Depression meetup
  Tuesday, 6-December, 7:30pm
  No Starch Press, 38 Ringold Street, San Francisco, CA 
  94103
  (near Civic Center BART Station)

  Let's have a meetup where geeks can talk about depression 
  and suicide. You are not alone. Share your story, if you 
  like. Share a friend's story. Or just hang out and 
  listen. Let's make it OK to talk about these things so 
  that we don't feel so alone with our feelings of being 
  alone and depressed or suicidal.

  This is not a support group -- none of us are trained 
  professionals, but we can get together in a safe, 
  confidential space to talk about depression and suicide 
  -- an important part of life for so many of us geeks.
  
  Mitch.

Instead of applying to what's out there, I'd be approaching companies that haven't bothered to post. A personalized email that included feedback on / ideas for / questions about my company, a description of what she could do for my company now and what role she'd like to grow into, affordable salary expectations, and a request to talk further by phone would certainly get my attention.

I may be missing sometime important here, so just FYI.<p>I started this on a Friday night into a Saturday as that's when I got the box delivered, and the correct low dosage of the pill.

In the end you may not make as much with an HBO/Comedy Central special, but would anyone know who Louis CK is without these?<p>It's more of a branding thing with the specials and getting your name out there. It may not payoff up front, but the deals that come after it (such as Louie, the TV show) make it well worth it in exchange for the money lost.<p>The trick isn't really building a platform for smaller indie people to do these sort of things, that's easy and already available widely. The trick is building a service where these smaller indie people can make it big without having to go through the big players like HBO/Comedy Central first. YouTube is on the right track and Pandora/Spotify seems to be doing this for music, they just need time to growth, because as big as YouTube is, it still doesn't have the weight and advertising ability that a channel like HBO/Comedy Central has. As the ability to sift through the junk becomes better and better via analysis of social cues/demographics, it will be easier for these sort of simple ""I don't care if you pirate because it's cheap enough"" models to take off for smaller people. But at that point YouTube or whoever fills that gap just becomes the next HBO/Comedy Central and the cycle repeats.<p>Bottom line is there's always going to be a ""big wig"" who owns almost all the eggs. For standup comedy it's Comedy Central and HBO. If you can make it there you're set. Maybe someday it will be the YouTube comedy channel, but someones going to always come out ahead and being the leader means you can set your own price on what you wish to pay (as HBO/Comedy Central has done here).",1323804612

Random rules -- no doubt put in place for good reasons to prevent fraud -- haphazardly applied to people and resulting in a lifetime ban from being a seller?<p>I have no problem with Amazon running a clean shop. In fact, I wish they'd do more to make it that way. What I have a problem with is systems of rules that are put up without any feedback mechanism in place. So instead of some real, live person listening to complaints and eventually coming to an understanding that this is totally whacked, thousands get dumped in the trash can until somebody finally manages to make a public relations case out of it? Completely unsatisfactory.<p>This is just poor systems design, Amazon. This is exactly the same systems problem many are having with PayPal, and for exactly the same reason. Be as strict as you like, but always include the possibility that <i>you might be wrong</i>. Because if you have no self-correction mechanisms, people aren't going to like you much.

3348763,comment,3347638,3347638,2,0,arrel,,,"From my friend Evan Smith, who's a lawyer and couldn't be bothered to sign up for HN:<p>I believe the author is slightly incorrect. First off, there is no ""optimal"" slip angle for all situations. Putting on your physics hat for a second, think about a race car tire at the Indy 500. As the car enters turn 1 at 200 mph, the driver turns the wheel. The tire, due to rotational and centrifugal forces, will slightly change shape under these pressures. As a result, the contact patch of the tire can be pointing in a slightly different direction than the tire itself during the turn. The anglular measurement of that difference is ""slip angle."" A small amount of slip angle can be good, as it can increase grip up to a certain point. However, beyond that point, grip is no longer improved and you can transition from a slip angle to a slide angle, where the tire has lost grip. Depending on whether you want the back tires lose grip first (oversteer, where the back end comes around) or understeer (where the front tires lose grip first and you lose some steering, think driving in snow) you can use the slip angles to tailor the car's handling to the driver and the racecourse. The optimal slip angle is that angle which maximizes grip without inducing momentum-sapping slide angles or creating too much drag. Optimal slip angle depends on all sorts of things: chassis set up, tires, racetrack temperature, etc. While the author may know more about this than I do, I've never heard of seven degrees of slip being optimal for all situations.<p>Also, I think the author's metaphor is inelegant: driving beyond the limit means you are not allowing the full power of your engine to be transmitted to the tires. The fastest drivers are those who drive at the limit of available grip. If you drive beyond the limit of available grip, the power of your engine will not be transmitted efficiently to the road because the tires are not gripping it fully.",1323803667

I also have fibromyalgia syndrome.<p>I feel like I'm constantly fighting my body's natural cycle. When I had school/a job that required a specific schedule, I used an alarm clock to get up, and had constant fms flareups and frequent insomnia. When I switched to my current job (at a startup, and no longer required to stick to a specific schedule as long as I'm getting my stuff done), I ditched the alarm clock, and my fibromyalgia pain has vastly improved, just from not trying to force my sleep schedule.<p>But the problem with that, is left to my body's own devices, I tend to want to be awake for about 20 hours, then sleep around 7. Then I start feeling guilty about coming in later and later every day, and there's still a limit to how many hours straight you can work and be productive, and even as flexible as my schedule is, there's still a bit of pressure to work 5 days a week for 8+ hours, not 4 days a week for 10+ hours. And coming into to work between 10pm-4am just never feels right. Once I get to the point where I'm waking up at 8-9pm, I usually have to waste a weekend forcing myself to stay up 24hrs or more to ""flip"" my schedule back to something reasonable. I hate doing that, because then my entire weekend is spent feeling like a zombie and then it's straight back to work again.<p>So if you've got some more details on how melatonin and a lightbox worked for you, even just a blog post you could point me at, I'd be really appreciative.",1323803601

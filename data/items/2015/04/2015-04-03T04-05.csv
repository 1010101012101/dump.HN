9314450,comment,9304541,9310151,0,0,zaroth,,,"An attacker can&#x27;t change a token without locking out the valid client, that&#x27;s the &quot;noise&quot; I was speaking of. If my requests suddenly start failing because my token is no longer valid, the attacker has <i>shown their hand</i> and we now have proof of a compromise. There are many attack vectors which could provide read or even read/write access to the token database without memory access or code execution. To name one from last week, how about Slack?<p>Nothing, literally, nothing, can provide protection against the attack vector you&#x27;re saying this does not help against. Sure, and of course I agree. But obviously we don&#x27;t give up and do nothing because <i>sometimes</i> exploits grant root. We add layers of defense and expect that some will hold, and some will not. Some will act to contain a breach across certain vectors, and some will be run over. Some will simply slow an attacker down, or prevent them from walking away with 100% of your data, and only get a percentage based on the time they were able to maintain the compromise.<p>I don&#x27;t know what you mean that the line is &quot;not going to deter an attacker&quot;. Surely you understand the difference between a short-lived attack which can only target persisted data, and a persistent attack with full memory access, and surely your threat model allows for one without the other in many cases? So green boxes in those cases for this technique, and N/A for the other boxes. What am I missing?<p>There are attacks it does not withstand, the same attacks that make password hashing useless by-the-way, and there are attacks that it certainly does withstand. There are also several attack vectors which it eliminates completely, and various follow-on benefits which I listed as well.<p>On the whole it is a large positive in a simple obvious package with no possible downside (except perhaps auditors flagging it as a bug). I never said it was a magic bullet which protects you from full persistent system compromise. I understand exactly what protections it provides and beneficial policy restrictions it imposes.<p>I find the resistance to such a simple defense-in-depth perplexing. It not being perfect is not a reason not to do it. Neither is password hashing, but we still do that. I really am shocked that token hashing would be at all controversial. I do it, and I think everyone else should too.<p>&quot;It doesn&#x27;t provide the protection that the developer is led to believe.&quot; Well this is much more true of <i>bcrypt</i> than it is of token hashing! What percentage of passwords does bcrypt protect, and for how many minutes after the database is popped? It&#x27;s impossible to answer. What percentage of tokens does token hashing protect? If you can answer a) describe the access level granted by the compromise, and b) describe the time when the compromise began, then I can definitively answer that question.<p>The answer cannot be, assume the attacker had full root access to all systems. Because we are under attack every single day, and some of those attacks succeed in some limited measure. There are laws on the books today, and new ones coming, which require <i>rapid</i> disclosure of the actual extent of data breaches, so this isn&#x27;t academic.<p>Of course the exact extent of a compromise is not always know, but likewise there are cases where the extent of a compromise is precisely known, and in a subset of those cases, a hashed token prevents an attacker impersonating your clients.<p>I mean, sha256(token) is child&#x27;s play, to be arguing about it is just odd. I&#x27;d like to see homomorphic encryption stop even a memory-sniffing attacker from ever intercepting my tokens. Lets get serious! What, you&#x27;d rather just trust TLS? :-/",1428036721

9314443,comment,9311752,9312730,0,0,nsfmc,,,"Hi there and congrats on working through this course. Most students coming into this class are learning all the formalized truth table/mappings/isomorphism/etc stuff for the first time. I took this class after having failed a course in Real Analysis and ended up appreciating it not so much as a math class but as a good intro to how to think about Theoretical Computer Science.<p>Looking back at the psets, i think it&#x27;s actually worth looking at them in reverse order just to not get too discouraged: the class ends on some number theory and begins with the Relation/Axiom/Set/Sequence stuff you see in early high level math classes. Some of that number theory/counting stuff is incredibly accessible from the outset, so the class doesn&#x27;t just get monotonically more obtuse.<p>That said, if you&#x27;ve worked through vellman and you finish up this class, you&#x27;re more than ready to do a class in proper number theory, discrete math or even real or complex analysis. Somebody else said that this course was a prereq for clrs, it is sort of, but you could take them both concurrently if you had to, as clrs doesn&#x27;t have such a strong focus on proofs (if you&#x27;re interested, 6.045j is a good followup in automata/computability/etc, lots of regexes, state machines and turing machines)<p>anyhow, i just want to say that it&#x27;s ok if you don&#x27;t get it all at once. i think i ended up seeing lots of these ideas two or three times in a variety of classes. probably the first time i was just mechanically spitting out proofs without understanding them. by the third time i came across them, they actually clicked for me. But there was value (for me at least) to exposure early on because you do know the things that are hazy and it&#x27;s easier to dive deeper on those the next time you encounter them.<p>have fun!",1428036487

9314435,comment,9313004,9313732,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I have to admit that I once thought essentially the same thing that you have written.  However, I&#x27;m not so sure now.  I think Software Freedom is distinct from copyright and while copyright in its current form is a problem for Software Freedom (insofar as it is too restrictive), doing away with copyright does not seem to be on the agenda of those who are concerned with Software Freedom (notably the FSF).  If it were, we could all move to CC0 from GPL and be happy.<p>I am not one of those who would espouse that all FOSS software should use unrestrictive licenses.  CC0, or attribution based Free software licenses definitely have their place, but I think that the world would be poorer without a license like the GPL.  The GPL ensures an even playing field so that someone can&#x27;t take a large Free project, add a small piece and compete with the original project using different rules.  If someone wants to compete against a GPLed project, they either have to play by the same rules or build their own project from the ground up.<p>Instead of &quot;copyright or not copyright&quot;, I think the Free software movement has shown that there is a range of restrictions that can be beneficial.  Picking the appropriate restrictions for your project is an incredibly important task.  When looking at CC (Creative Commons) licenses, I think it becomes a bit more obvious what things are valuable.  They definitely benefitted from being able to  look at the history of Free Software development when these licenses were developed.<p>I know there is a growing movement of people who are extremely enthusiastic about very unrestrictive licenses.  However, I can&#x27;t help thinking that they miss something -- only thinking about a binary world of very restrictive (all rights reserved) and non restrictive (at best attribution only).  To be honest, I love the thought of living in a world where everything was CC0 and everyone would willingly encourage people to take the source code and make derivative works.  Of course it isn&#x27;t.  Even in a world without copyright, this would not happen because lacking legal means, companies would pursue technical means of making it difficult to make derived works. Because of this I tend to license my work as GPL because I know a thriving, fair community can be served this way.  The restrictions (made possible by copyright) are valuable.",1428036050

So they found fast radio bursts (FRB) to have DMs (Dispersion Measure) that are in perfect multiplication with integers to a constant. This was supposed to be bit more random and so these being in such order is very surprising and unlikely to be just coincidence. Only 11 FRBs are found so far which might also means source of signal is not all around. On the downside, the signal were assumed to require huge amount of energy in short burst that Sun would produce in entire day. That assumption lead to belief that FRBs were too close to be in our Milkeyway and more likely to be in other galaxy. Overall very interesting development.",1428034258

It really does seem like Kraft was well within their rights to order as much wheat as they wanted.

My biggest impression was that the traders were pissed off that a food company had pulled one over on them and they hadn&#x27;t been able to cash in on the change in the spreads.

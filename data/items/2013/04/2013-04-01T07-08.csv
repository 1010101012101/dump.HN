5471981,comment,5469646,5471789,4,0,kragen,,,"Let's suppose current medium-spec cellphones have a gigahertz CPU, and that it can do one flop per cycle, peak performance.  That's probably a tenth of a flop per cycle at LINPACK, which is how the Top500 list is ranked.  So that's a hundred megaflops in your cell phone today, guessing.<p>This was the first petaflop machine.  A petaflop is a million gigaflops, or ten million current cellphones.  That's roughly 23 doublings in performance.  If Moore's Law were to continue at one doubling per two years, that would be 46 years, or about 2059.  Another ten or fifteen years might pass before low-end cellphones have it.<p>But 46 years is a long time.  46 years ago was 1967.  There were no packet-switched computer networks.  Nobody had ever seen a video arcade.  Computers mostly interacted with people via punched cards, or at best a teletype.  The Bloom filter had not yet been discovered.  Timesharing and high-level languages were radical, risky concepts; the popular high-level languages of the time were all domain-specific, not general-purpose like C.  There was no such thing as a mouse.  There were graphical user interfaces and virtual reality.  Humans had never walked on the moon.<p>46 years from now, there may not be cellphones, or humans.  We certainly won't still be doubling the density of planar silicon chips every 18 months.",1364803144

This is obviously not as good, but it provides several benefits.<p>First of all, if you gain access to my email account, you can't read my email because you don't have my PGP key. So for example, even if you trigger a password reset email for any of my other online accounts, you wont be able to access the confirmation link/code contained within in order to take over those accounts too.<p>Secondly, the mail store on my server and all of my email clients, eg inside K-9 mail on my phone/tablet and Evolution on my laptop are all encrypted. So if you compromise/steal any of those devices, you don't automatically get direct access to all of my mail.<p>Thirdly, it means I use PGP every day, so I become more familiar with the way it works and how to use it over time. I tried using PGP in the past but ended up forgetting how to use it properly because people rarely sent encrypted mail to me.<p>How awesome would it be if we woke up tomorrow and Google had added a section to their GMail settings page where you could upload your public PGP key and it would automatically encrypt all of your incoming mail with it?

5471921,comment,5466872,5467179,1,0,account_taken,,,"These kinds problems can easily be solved with promises too. It would be even simpler if `fs.stat` returned a promise and there are promise libraries that do that. Promises is a small library I use, probably about the same number of bytes as your library, as I transition my code from callbacks to promises.<p><pre><code>      var queue = new Promises;
      fs.stat(""file1.txt"", queue.cb());
      fs.stat(""file2.txt"", queue.cb());
      fs.stat(""file2.txt"", queue.cb());
      queue.all()

</code></pre>
But, comparing how promises solves the same flow as callbacks misses the point. Here's an example where an action is taken when two events fire (promises shine here):<p><pre><code>      pub.on('foo', function() {
        promise1.fulfill();

      pub.on('bar', function() {

I don't get enough of this.<p>You're right that 28 lines is pretty ridiculous, but it's because I never abstracted out that code. The playlist code is some of the ugliest in that project, because I got pretty lazy with it. I know it's terrible. The console logging stuff is part of that.<p>Q actually allows exceptions to cause promise rejections, which is both a nifty feature and a potential curse (e.g. throwing an exception before releasing a resource).<p>I like the changes you propose (not considering testing), but with slightly different implementation. the DbCommand should be creating its own deferreds, rather than accepting one as a parameter. This kind of promise handling is best left up to DbCommand to implement, rather than the caller. In Q it's easy to chain promises, like so:<p><pre><code>    Q.fcall(someFunction).then(function(result) {
      return functionThatReturnsAPromise();
    }).then(function(secondResult) {
      console.log(secondResult);
    }).done();
</code></pre>
Also, in a proper redesign, Q's denodeify function can change the whole flow of the execute function entirely:<p><pre><code>    DbCommand.prototype.execute = function(query, onComplete) {
      var self = this;
      Q.denodeify(dbConnectionPool.acquire).then(function(connection) {
        self.connection = connection;
        return Q.denodeify(connection.query);
      }).then(function(rows) {
        return onComplete(rows);
      }).finally(function() {
        self.connection && dbConnectionPool.release(self.connection);
      }).done();
    };
</code></pre>
Q's denodeify call works with Node.js callbacks which follow the convention that the error is the first argument, and the result all others. denodeify then converts the error into an argument for any calls to Q.fail. Any uncaught errors will be thrown after done() is called.<p>However, I am not sold on the idea of creating a prototype for DB commands. There's no state that needs to be held, and the code is abstract enough without introducing a prototype.<p>Again, thanks for the code review. The playlist DB code needs a lot of refactoring, since right now there's too much repetition I've been too lazy to fix. If you want to talk some more, feel free to email me.",1364800193
5471884,comment,5471131,5471785,2,0,bmelton,,,"I have researched this subject a lot, and I can assure that yes, I have far more reasons than just because the Founders intended it.<p>For 1, more armed populaces tend to be safer places to live.  To quote Heinlein, ""An armed society is a polite society"", and there is evidence to that fact here in America.  Of interest is a place called Kennesaw, GA which, in 1981 (I think) they enacted a law encouraging every head of household to own a firearm.  In the year they enacted that law, burglaries in the town of Kennesaw dropped 80%. Since then, their crime rate has held at FAR below the national average, as well as the state of Georgia.  Somewhat ironically, it obviously didn't ""solve crime"", but did displace it to areas outside of Kennesaw to a very large degree.  Before the law was enacted, it seemed as though every media outlet in the nation was decrying the law as it would surely be ""a wild west town"" and ""blood in the streets"" and all that, but that never happened.  What happened instead is that they effectively pushed crime (and presumably criminals) out of town.  Since then, the population of Kennesaw has quintupled, but crime rates have stayed low.<p>Meanwhile, if you look to Morton Grove, IL, they enacted a gun ban at a similar time, and crime (of all types) went up across the charts.  When they repealed their gun ban, crime went down.  The data on Morton Grove isn't quite as marked as Kennesaw (e.g., only 17% difference instead of the more obvious 80%), so it's possibly attributable to other factors, but it's hard to explain away the results in Kennesaw.<p>Further, the state that has the highest concentration of ""fully automatic"" machine guns (e.g., already to buy new) is New Hampshire.  They also have some of the most lax gun control in the nation.  Open carrying firearms is fairly common place in New Hampshire, and if I recall correctly, the only thing you need a permit for is to concealed carry in a vehicle.  On top of that, their state buildings don't even have metal detectors, and you're allowed to carry guns in there.  Wild West sounding?  Maybe, but it's the third safest state in the union.<p>Again, I have more data to support my position with better than ""cause the Constitution said so"", though I do obviously agree with my interpretation (which is also the Supreme Court's interpretation) of what it means.",1364800172

<i>This is a canard - where have all the second amendment activists been for this century so far? They don't seem to be doing a very good job of it, and don't seem particularly interested in protecting any amendment other than the second.</i><p>I have to confess that I take a certain amount of offense to that, though I'm not exactly sure what you're implying (I'm just vaguely offended at this point. ;-).<p>Are you trying to assert that people who care about the second amendment only care about the second amendment?  Or are you trying to assert that people who care about the second amendment have been complacent for the past decade?  Both?  Some combination thereof?<p>At least personally, I've been politically active in a number of civil rights issues including those on the first and fourth amendments.  I've testified before state Senate and my House of Representatives on civil liberties and the potential incursion of those liberties for some time now.  (Thereby disproving that all gun nuts only care about the second amendment.)<p>As for the second, at least in Maryland, we've been fighting our 'May Issue' statutes here in Maryland, and I was personally a part of the case that got our state laws overturned (at least temporarily) to 'Shall Issue' status (though it's currently back in legal flux, but that should disprove that all second amendment advocates have been complacent).<p>Knowing that your statements weren't a Boolean, I'll wait for clarification as to what you actually meant, but I think that it's perhaps only as visible lately because the second amendment is in such peril.  In the past decade though, there have been nearly a dozen high profile cases in defense of the second amendment in DC, Illinois, Chicago and Maryland at the least.<p>Also, oddly enough, the American Civil Liberties Union doesn't recognize that the right to bear arms is an individual right (and they believe that the ruling in DC v Heller, which specifically states that it <i>is</i> an individual right is wrong), so second amendment advocates tend to clump together into one of two groups, where you either are or aren't in support of the ACLU.",1364799884

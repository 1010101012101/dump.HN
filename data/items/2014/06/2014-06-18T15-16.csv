I monetized it recently and would like to continue making some cash off it (to cover costs and as an incentive and excuse to continue doing this). On top of that, I like to write, the more people read my shit, the more I&#x27;m excited to write.<p>What sucks about this entire dilemma is that we&#x27;re all looking at &quot;lost revenue&quot;, no one is looking at &quot;quality content going down the drain&quot;. Good search results disappear and are replaced by someone who has a ton of cash backing them whose content is meant to convert and monetize, make cash off the user and nothing else.<p>At least in my case, I want people to primarily read my stuff.<p>And it seems ridiculous to me that someone would say, &quot;Who cares if people read your blog, it&#x27;s not as if you&#x27;re making any money off it!&quot;<p>Can you imagine some of the most popular devs that have non-monetized blogs all of a sudden disappearing from google search with their insights and answers? Among others, there&#x27;s Jeff Atwood and Scott Hanselman both of whom rank well but have non-monetized sites.",1403107172
7910825,comment,7906501,7908532,0,0,ansible,,,"I do appreciate your perspective RogerL.  And I do appreciate the fact that we&#x27;re taking about &quot;cool&quot; robotics that are primarily intended to cause pain, suffering and death.  Sometimes at a large scale.<p>The political reality of the USA right now is that we&#x27;ve got a huge military industrial complex, and it ain&#x27;t going away anytime soon.  One way or the other, we&#x27;re going to be building weapon systems for air superiority and other uses.<p>Whether or not that is all a good idea is a discussion for another day.  I think that over the last two decades, the USA could have been using more &quot;soft power&quot; to better accomplish our long-term strategic goals than with the precision guided munitions that seemed to be the preferred solution.<p>Anyway...<p>At this point, I&#x27;d just like to (A) see a better value for my tax dollar.  And (B) I&#x27;d like to see our military prepared properly for the next war rather than the last one.<p>With regards to (A), on the cheap vs. expensive scale, I strongly think that we have erred on the side of expensive with regards to the F-35 (and the F-22).  I think the Super Hornet (F/A-18E) is expensive enough as it is.  Sure, the Navy bought it first, so of course the Air Force doesn&#x27;t want it...<p>As far as (B) goes, with all the sabre-rattling we get from Russia and China, realistically speaking, we&#x27;re not going to be another shooting war with either of them.  I&#x27;d rather we have more weapon systems that can deal better with the threats we currently have, and will face next.  I don&#x27;t see how the F-35 can really help with that either, in part because the cost means we can&#x27;t deploy them in the numbers we really ought to.<p>I realize that automation right now is not up to what a pilot can do, but it is rapidly improving.  I&#x27;d rather we have a base platform that can accept upgrades easily as they become available, and that can be deployed in numbers to be effective.",1403107155

7910787,comment,7909908,7909908,3,0,nomedeplume,,,"For a heterosexual man, a woman can&#x27;t be your identity.  Most heterosexual women need a partner with their own identity, one that she can merge with (she may temporarily settle for a partner who functions with her as their identity, but then she&#x27;ll be unhappy, leave, cheat, or fantasize about cheating, or just be using the partner for other reasons).  This is tough advice to swallow especially if your  woman is your identity or you can&#x27;t imagine a woman not being your identity, but it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve learned[1].<p>Find a good identity for yourself and create it.  Make it something that you can get good at reasonably quickly so you become socially validated within it, because we are happy when our identity is socially validated (i.e., others recognize that we are what we think we are), or you will be facing an unreasonably miserable uphill battle.  And &quot;internal validation&quot; is the product of repeated and varied social validation, and it does have a decay curve.<p>Example of a bad identity to make : &quot;I am really good at soccer!&quot; (if you are bad at soccer, it will take you 10 years before you feel validated and comfortable in your identity)<p>Example of a good identity to make : &quot;I am a great programmer and a leader in the programming community!&quot;   This is easier for you to get better at and it&#x27;s well within the realm of your control.. for example, you can develop expertise in a niche area, learn basic presentation skills, and start presenting at local meetups.. probably within 6 months of focused effort after work.<p>Traits for a good identity: reasonably quick learning curve to socially-valued  competence.  Even better if it is something that has future payouts.  You can get a &quot;bad boy&quot; identity if you want to e.g. buy a motorcycle, get a neck tattoo, and physically street fight people who don&#x27;t submit to your dominance, but it also bears very real cost.  Those costs, btw, are why bad boys are attractive - it&#x27;s a serious energy expenditure.<p>We are generally happy when our identity is socially validated.  People with rarely-validated identities are quite susceptible to manipulation; simply by validating their identity... they will begin to crave you.<p>Your partner can&#x27;t be your identity.  Even if it&#x27;s just because that makes it a single point of failure for your happiness.<p>[1] Email in profile if you want to discuss this issue specifically.

I started preaching from door to door at age 5 and was baptized at age 11. My parents have been in since 8 years old, and their parents have been in since their late 20s. Most of my family is in the religion and all of my friends were in it.<p>I believed in demons and angels.<p>I believed (as all true Witnesses do) that there were angels watching over us when we were preaching. In the 90s when I was 14 I would preach on a street that had the highest murder rate in Joliet. It was called the hill and was lined with crack houses and gangs on the corners. Also I&#x27;m white and everyone that lived on the hill was black. I preached without fear because I knew that I couldn&#x27;t get murdered because god would save me with his angels.<p>Demons were very real as well – every Witness knows a few stories or has a friend of a friend that had a demon possessed item. I had reoccurring nightmares from the time I was a child onward that I was being attacked by demons, or that a family member was actually a demon waiting to kill me. I was genuinely afraid of the dark and especially mirrors in the dark until I was 28 years old.<p>I had never been exposed to other religious teachings or education surrounding evolution or cosmology. Instead I learned about these things from the Watchtower&#x27;s publications which are of course slanted against science in their own special way.<p>the people I worked with were atheists and had no idea I was in a (mostly) fundamentalist religion until I had been hired. They launched a series of attacks on my beliefs, looked up videos and stories on the internet about Witnesses (after I told them I wasn&#x27;t allowed to) and essentially forced those things on me.\nIn truth, this just strengthened my faith... but then something changed. They started acting friendly to me instead of attacking me on a daily basis (I think that&#x27;s because after 2 years I had enough and threatened to sue in an email). Down the line this gave me the chance to ask them if they had ever seen demons (I knew they all did drugs and I was always told this is a way for demons to take hold of your mind).<p>They of course laughed at this question and assured me that they had never seen a demon. I then asked a good friend of mine from that job who had grown up doing drugs and around drugs if he had seen demons. He hadn&#x27;t either. This got me curious so I started researching demons on the internet and found that they&#x27;re basically treated as mythology.\nThat pretty much opened the floodgates. I researched homeopathy (I didn&#x27;t have a real doctor until my teens – only a homeopathic chiropractor) and found out that it was pseudoscience. When I brought that up to my mother, she had a reaction that was similar to attacking someone&#x27;s faith – that bothered me greatly and I realized in that moment that she was willing to believe everything. From there the entire house of cards fell, though very slowly. It took about 2.5 years to fully break free from the beliefs I once held as true and the internet is ultimately responsible for keeping me out. I was able to use it to research forbidden knowledge and join communities of other ex-witnesses who were struggling with the same issues.<p>Now I&#x27;m an atheist. My family relationships are strained at best (I&#x27;ve seen my parents and sister one time in the last 4 years, though they will speak to me briefly on occasion). I lost all of the friends I had built up over the years and as of last year I was totally alone save for the one good friend mentioned above and his girlfriend. They helped me to get through this by letting me hang out at their house a lot.<p>These days I&#x27;m doing much better. I&#x27;m so much happier without religion. It vacuumed up every iota of my spare time and I received nothing in return. I am convinced that all religion is destructive and corrupt, including Eastern religions. I think the notion of a god and spirits is laughable to the point of embarrassment and to deny science is to deny your own existence.<p>You are correct that most born-in Witnesses would never leave. That&#x27;s because it means completely upheaving your life and becoming someone new. For many people that means drugs, sex, alcohol and partying – the things they weren&#x27;t allowed in the religion. I did these things myself, but I was able to slow down and catch myself before I hit the bottom.

The idea behind negative SEO is to use tools to build a large amount of spammy links, such that 99% of the link profile of a site is obvious spam. This is easily achieved with tools like Xrumrer and Scrapebox. Find a site with 1000 backlinks, build a few hundred thousand spammy backlinks to it, and watch it drop.<p>To do the same for mattcutts.com you would have to build hundreds of millions spam backlinks to &quot;outspam&quot; his millions of legitimate backlinks. This is nontrivial.<p>So the people at the mercy of Negative SEO are the people least equipped to defend themselves: small hobby site owners, webmasters with personal blogs, small businesses etc. You can easily knock out their sites from the SERPs and they would never know what happened.

This is good advice, especially to help with the mental aspect of things so that you don&#x27;t end your life prematurely.<p>But one thing no one mentioned, that i&#x27;m a bit surprised about because you mention falling asleep during work, waking up not feeling refreshed, etc. is a <i>sleep study</i>.\nIt&#x27;s very very possible you might have a sleep disorder. You sound very much like i did in the early stages of my own sleep disorder, before my life completely fell apart, before multiple suicide attempts, before becoming homeless, before moving back home with my parents, before 9 years after symptoms first started, with health insurance again due to ACA in the US i finally saw a competent doctor and got properly evaluated, and found out i had developed narcolepsy.<p>Any number of other sleep disorders could cause your symptoms too, of depression and anxiety, as well as the other issues, with conditions like sleep apnea being the most common.<p>Please please speak to your GP and get a sleep study done, if you haven&#x27;t had one done already. It&#x27;s definitely worth doing before you make any final decisions, and it just might save your life.",1403105907

So not considering or knowing the difference of money, and the greater cheapness nor the names of his bread, I made him give me three-penny worth of any sort.

Cloudflare is not using SNI: it is simply creating a certificate with multiple domains in it; contrary to popular belief, SSL certificates can be valid for multiple disjoint domains through a field called SAN (subject alternate names). So a single certificate served by a single IP on a SSL terminator can be valid for multiple domains, without having to use SNI. They probably have some custom agreement with their CA (GlobalSign) for the economic part and for the fully-automatic provisioning based on their control of the nameserver (instead of the usual link sent to root@domain).<p>Another company doing the same is Google; they have a single certificate valid for all their properties (youtube, google.*, etc.), so that they can have a network in which SSL terminators are totally disjoint from the websites they proxy for.<p>As for the security, the certificates&#x27; private keys are fully handled by Cloudflare, and website owners don&#x27;t get access to them. The security of a website sharing the same certificate of your website is immaterial for your security. You just need to worry that Cloudflare is not hacked, but that&#x27;s part of the deal once you start using it anyway, it doesn&#x27;t get specifically worse if you activate SSL.<p>I don&#x27;t know if the TLS standard has some limit on the number of SAN, but there is a technical limit, because the certificate gets bigger and bigger (and thus connections slower and slower). Cloudflare probably has some per-certificate limit (e.g.: 100 domains) after which they simply begin creating a new certificate on a new IP.<p>I&#x27;m instead curious on how they plan to make SSL free for everybody by the end of the year. Possibly through SNI, but I&#x27;m not sure; I would say the CA cost outweighs the IP cost, but I&#x27;m not sure how the numbers for those services work out at CloudFlare scale.",1403105043

Make mistakes. You can&#x27;t learn anything without learning how to recognize you&#x27;ve made a mistake. But networking on github is just networking on the Internet, you&#x27;ll also need to find communities of people to associate with in real-life to network.

See this discussion: <a href=""https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/issues/5661"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/issues/5661</a> .<p>Basically, docker used to have a &quot;drop&quot; list associated with each execdriver. By default docker kept all kernel bestowed capabilities but would explicitly drop those on the execdriver&#x27;s drop list. This created issues with compatibility. If an image was prepared on a kernel that <i>didn&#x27;t</i> have a particular capability at all and was suddenly run on one that was, weird hard to diagnose behavioral differences could emerge. So now docker drops everything by default and the execdrivers have a &quot;keep&quot; list. Also, there&#x27;s now a check for the kernel defining a capability before trying to mess with it.<p>There are---of course---still some issues. For example, docker drops everything then tries to add the capability back. That won&#x27;t work for some capabilities because some can&#x27;t be added back once they&#x27;ve been renounced.

A solution that works well for you might not necessarily work as well for someone else.  That is one reason why I am reluctant to say your advice is bad.

What you do is buy multiple 50k &quot;xrumer&quot; postings with &quot;pingbacks&quot; for that website you want gone.  Add in some spammy Fiverr jobs plus buy some links for that website you want gone on Text-Link-Ads then report that website as having paid links.  This method works 100% of the time.  This creates such a firestorm of links a webmaster would have to spend a month trying to disavow them and a lot of times webmasters don&#x27;t even know what disavow means.  Google is so worried about spamming and punishing websites rather then just ignoring the bad data. Since Google is out to punish and Google... it&#x27;s a computer program it can&#x27;t tell one thing from another other then these junk links exist therefor the hammer must be brought down on the webmaster who has no idea of what is going on.  This was a year or more ago but I promise that this would work fine today.  The smaller the website the better it works.

7910473,comment,7909201,7910321,0,0,denibertovic,,,"I think you&#x27;re missing the point. The Celery (or any task queue really) particulars are very important here, cause you don&#x27;t want background workers hammering your database if they don&#x27;t need to. Cause the workers wan&#x27;t work with a AMQP implementation, which the database is not. It&#x27;s like using a fork instead of a hammer, sure you might get a few nails but it&#x27;s not the right tool for the job.<p>The systems that use these kinds of tools are usually not structured in a way that they need to wait for something in the database to be stored. By nature they are async tasks and they should be able to run whenever and return sometime in the future, and they will most likely produce some kind of result in the database, so there is no reason to store the job information itself in the database.<p>Jobs are usually not created as hooks after a database commit, so jobs being persisted with database transactions is not quite relevant and Celery has failure mechanism and ways to recover if it was not able to send a task to the broker (ie. RabbitMQ was down).<p>Redis and RabbitMQ do have a mechanism of persisting jobs onto disk as well so they don&#x27;t get lost when the process is restarted. So there is no way that a job get&#x27;s lost forever as you say, if you handle all these cases correctly.<p>One more thing, Python&#x27;s database drivers don&#x27;t work quite as you&#x27;ve described. Namely they don&#x27;t (by design) make use of the autocommit feature of the database engine, rather they wrap <i>every</i> sql statement in a transaction, so either way each statement get&#x27;s executed separately in it&#x27;s own transaction. This would not guarantee, let&#x27;s say a db record being added <i>and</i> the job being saved as well.

The test for disparagement has two elements: 1) whether the mark singles out an identifiable group; and 2) whether a substantial composite of the group would find the mark disparaging. That is to say, the mark doesn&#x27;t just have to be offensive to someone somewhere, but rather it has to be perceived as disparaging by a substantial portion of the particular group singled out by the mark.<p>A good example of this is &quot;Dykes on Bikes,&quot; a trademark that was allowed after evidence showing that lesbians did not find the term disparaging: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dykes_on_Bikes#Legal_battle_to_register_DOB_as_a_trademark"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dykes_on_Bikes#Legal_battle_to_...</a> (&quot;The court found that men had no grounds to be offended by the term. McDermott stated his opposition against any group associated with the annual Dyke March, which he dubbed &#x27;the Annual Illegal San Francisco Dyke Hate Riot&#x27; in which he and all men are subject to criminal attacks and civil right violations.&quot;)<p>In this particular case, although many native americans do not mind the term, a sizable portion find it to be akin to the n-word for african americans. Indeed, in the early 1990&#x27;s a native american group brought cancellation proceedings for the trademark: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Redskins_name_controversy#Legal_and_regulatory_action"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Redskins_name_contro...</a>. The USPTO canceled the registration then, but the decision was overturned on appeal for insufficient evidence of disparagement.",1403103705

Logic simply has no bearing on such decisions.<p>This is why irrational drives are essential. Down there at the bottom of whatever logical structure you have built sits an irrational longing, desire or passion which keeps you going. For the OP it was a family and a drive for successful reproduction. It can be other things, too. Without a drive like this giving you a purpose, logic won&#x27;t prevent you from self-destruction.",1403103699

I must help them spread, I must help them develop, because they might completely change the world for the better! and no matter how small the chance of one of my ideas significantly changing the world, and of one of these ideas not being in other people&#x27;s heads too, this chance simply cannot be taken...

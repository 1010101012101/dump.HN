We created and own the best communication and research network in history.<p>3.  Programming brings our ideas into existence in very short order, and allows us to model pretty much every aspect of reality.<p>Unfortunately, we also tend to get stuck in our own little world of ideas, a important strength which is our major flaw.",1190425584

Strange that an essay that talks about philosophy doesn't have even once the word soul.<p>Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotel seperates animals from humans as beings that have soul and the ability to think. <p>His work ""Physics"" tried to capture concepts people ignore even these days, and tried to examine in an amazing use of reason various metaphysical phenomena trying to find balance between whats real, fake and imaginary.<p>If you read the works of Aristotel and others, in original Greek you will be amazed by his astonishing ability to convey truth in a wonderful ingenious word of speech.<p>--<p>Plato talked about many not-connected subjects in a very indirect way to put the reader in becoming part of his works. Ingenius! <p>A very important concept of Socrates and Plato is the world of ideas. A seperate existance/entity/world that we all have access to. Modern science doesn't accept that, as there is not proof for that. But doesn't the fact that a lot of people share similar ideas at different place and time may be a small clue of exactly that?<p>",1190425095

58226,comment,58175,58175,0,0,Jd,,,"INTERVIEWER: What do you mean when you say programming is a religious experience for a lot of people?<p>[GARY] KILDALL: Well, if you talk about programming to a group of programmers who use the same language, they can become almost evangelistic about the language. They form a tight-knit community, hold to certain beliefs, and follow certain rules in their programming. It's like a church with a programming language for a bible...
But I'm not putting myself in a special category either; I can preach about the wonders of LISP all day.<p>--excerpt from Programmers at Work, S. Lammers",1190424660

Some of them - for instance, Wittgenstein - even manage to do it.<p>Going back to the science analogy, new hypotheses are accepted not once supporting evidence is found - even UFOs have supporting evidence, after all! - but only for as long as attempts to produce confounding evidence fail.",1190423500

58222,comment,58025,58218,0,0,neilc,,,"> Rand's entire philosophy was carefully contrived to justify the conclusions she wanted justified, and that makes it worthless as philosophy<p>""Worthless"" is far overstating the case: in general it is hard to prove very much about the true motivations of philosophers, particularly long-dead ones. For example, it is quite likely that the exact lines of reasoning in Descartes' <i>Meditations</i> was contrived to reach the conclusions he wanted to reach beforehand, but to say that makes the whole thing ""worthless"" is pretty silly. Many philosophers can be criticized as developing rational arguments for positions they hold intuitively.",1190423124

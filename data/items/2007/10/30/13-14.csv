Galileo discovered his principle by conducting very simple experiments with no special tools or a lot of data collection. How do you find the relevant data or build relevant tools if you don't have a clue about what you are supposed to discover?<p>What computer vision needs is mathematics, in my opinion. And math has nothing to do with ""data collection and tool-building"". It is entirely about understanding.<p>The link provides a good example of how people try to solve problems without any understanding. They don't know how the brain operates, yet they build its ""model"". And then they expect this model to solve the problem for them...\n",1193752645

If they can't leverage current resources and a 200B valuation, how the hell are they going to beat facebook. Oh, and by the way, once FB/MSFT decides to make a push in Brazil, orkut can kiss their mkt share goodbye. Facebook is just that much better.",1193751993
74187,comment,73953,73953,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"You have essentially 2 options:<p>1. Coast in the day job and work on your startup.<p>2. Work during the day and put the startup on hold (or at least, focus less on it)<p>If you choose to do option 1, you should avoid the first company. You won't be able to coast there and the expectations would be that you are a fully functioning part of their team.<p>If option 2 is the way you choose to go, you'll learn more and probably be more satisfied working for company A.<p>My opinion, given your story is to go for Option 2. You're only 20, have no formal development experience, and have an opportunity to learn a great deal and possibly improve your financial standings. I would take the unpopular opinion that your startup can wait while you invest a little in yourself. Most of your peers are still in school. <p>If you do this, it's likely you'll learn a lot that you'll need to learn at any rate. At least this way you'll discover these things on someone else's dime.",1193751737

74184,comment,74096,74096,0,0,staunch,,,"More difficult for me was finding an idea I loved enough to settle on. I probably have an idea for a startup around 1-2 times a day. Probably 25% of them could be hugely successful for someone interested enough. I bounced around a bit before settling on one that has stayed interesting to me (and my cofounder) everyday as we've worked on it. It's actually increased the amount of ideas I have though, since I have to create things that I wish someone had already created.<p>The idea we're working on now is a very focused version of a grander idea we have. It's super small and users love it already, so we're just working on growing it.",1193751423

74182,comment,73953,74021,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"Nobody has time for mentoring. Even larger companies don't have people sitting around helping the young buck become better programmers.<p>What I would argue the startup gives you though, is a chance to grow in an environment where someone will be there to bail you out in the worst of cases. At a startup, it's highly possible that you'll need to learn as you code, but you'll at least get a chance to work on something new. At a big shop, I can guarantee you'll be working on feature x forever because nobody will trust you to touch the other pars of the system, and BA's will tell you what new features are needed.",1193751346

It's an easy one to make when working with templates; I have pages myself with this problem.  However, I do think it's worth pointing out.<p>It's standard just like stubbing your toe is standard.

I made a New Year's resolution to send an email a week to update my extended family on what we were up to.  I totally failed.  The failure dogged me often.  The problem was that when a lot was going on it was hard to find time to talk about it.  When less was going on it was hard to remember all the interesting things we had done.<p>Then I thought about digital photos with timestamps.  If I just took pictures when we did something interesting, later I could have the computer sort them out by date, and I could type in what we did each day that had photos.<p>I figured this would be useful for other busy parents, or for people who travel, or anybody else whose photos tell a story.",1193750821

What struck me about the 1924 essay was how strong the similarity was between success in early 20th-century grocery stores and success in Internet startups.  Determination edges out brilliance in both cases.<p>Another thing that struck me is that even this grocery store owner noticed the biggest problem with our educational system:<p><i>For a time I tried picking these youngsters out of the colleges. But my experience with college men was not fortunate. If I selected good students, I found too often that their leadership had been won by doing very well what their teachers had laid out for them. They had developed a fine capacity for taking orders, but not much initiative.</i>",1193749494

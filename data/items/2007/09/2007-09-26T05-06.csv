Don't you think that is a racist claim?<p>By the way I know several people from lower castes who are super intelligent. And forced hereditary occupations are a thing of the past EVERYWHERE. Even in Bihar, our most backward state, you can't FORCE someone from the lower cast to stick to a profession (which is why Lalu Prasad Yadav, our railway minister and his party came to power, by fighting for Dalits, or at least claiming to).<p>Make no mistake, the caste system is very prevalent but you don't need to exaggerate to make your point.

59725,comment,59473,59628,0,0,ajju,,,"Well their last name is what would prevent them from lying. They can change the last name though. <p>The irony is that there has been reservation for people from lower castes in government jobs and schools across the country and they pay much lower fees and get in with fewer marks. So you now have people from higher castes changing their names to lower castes to cheat and get into schools easily and also pay less.",1190785875
59724,comment,59473,59621,0,0,ajju,,,"The thing about wealth is patently untrue. 25 - 50% of the seats in ALL schools (yes, even private colleges, at least in the state I am from) are reserved for poor people from lower castes and their ANNUAL fees are less USD 200. I know first hand that this is true in Maharashtra (the state that Bombay belongs to).",1190785732

I was born a Brahmin myself and > 75% of my family members have ""dark"" skin. <p>The caste system is definitely racist and a much much bigger problem  but this whole linking of skin color to castes is just not true.",1190785581

The site is so generic that I'm sure there are very specific areas something similiar could be launched (with a few twists that Instructables have yet to think of).<p>The idea is also closely aligned to O'Reilly Make & Craft but who else has an eye on this market? (Avoid markets with no competition).  <p><i>""... A key insight behind instructables is that humans are constrained to working in linear time - ie you do things sequentially and are generally not in two places at once. ...""</i> <p>For me, the key insight is you can apply this reasoning to other concepts.

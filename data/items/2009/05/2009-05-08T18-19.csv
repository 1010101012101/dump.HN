The same way that mathematicians are happy with one-letter variable names, they're happy with juxtaposition as their one operator notation.  They just redefine everything whenever they start a new problem.<p>If you think about it, matrix multiplication is a totally different operation from multiplication in the reals.  We just happen to use the same notation for it because it follows some of the same rules (associativity, distributivity) that we're in the habit of using to manipulate equations.<p>This can get pretty extreme.  There's a branch of math called functional analysis, which identifies functions with infinite-dimensional vectors, and then does calculus on those ""vectors"" like they were points in any other space.  In their notation,<p>v = Tu<p>is like matrix multiplication<p>y = Ax<p>except that u and v are functions, and T is some kind of integral.<p>I think this is one reason the Lisp crowd gets cranky about the parenthesis thing -- the infix operators we all know and love are a lot less well-defined than we think they are.",1241808192

I believe that the primary reason that we get on whacked out diets is that we're using huge numbers of substitutes for natural foods which screw up our bodies natural calibration.  The craving you have for ""sweets""?  yeah, there wasn't any readily available source of processed sugar in the ancestral environment.  That craving is actually for fruit.<p>This is a low tech version of wireheading.  You're short circuiting the built in reward mechanisms of the brain by giving it an overload of the things it considers positive.  You crave fat and sugar because these things are rich in nutrients and energy.  We're built for scarcity and can't cope when we have unlimited access to these things.<p>Try reducing your intake of junk food and after 2 months you'll find normal cravings start to return and normal foods tasting better.",1241806158

If some recruiter asked me for my SSN over the phone I'd laugh at him and if he pushed the issue, I'd walk away or try to get hold of his boss depending on my mood. Certainly a recruiter has no business knowing your SSN!",1241806119

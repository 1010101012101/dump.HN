Chuck D has attitude. The real kind.<p>Public Enemy is really the precursor to a change in rap.  Their style, attitude, branding just seems so much stronger than anyone before them.<p>>Somewhat rap-ish: Spearhead & Michael Franti's solo work too... and some old-school classics like:\nFunky Four + 1 - That's The Joint (rap music's pure essence right there)\nSpoonie G - The Monster Jam\nSugarhill Gang - Rapper's Delight.\nGrandmaster Flash & The Furious Five - The Message.\nAnd maybe just for the heck of it, The Fatback Band's ""King Tim III, Personality Jock"", where it all started.<p>Oh man you are dating yourself with some of these classics.  I would say they were great for their time and really established the genre.  However, because of this I don't know if you can tell someone today just getting interested in rap to listen to them and understand how different and new and unique they were.  You almost have to listen to a ton of rap and then go back to the roots.",1234309943

476203,comment,475465,475595,0,0,rcoder,,,"AFAIK, none of the add-on replication mechanisms you mentioned can guarantee total consistency across multiple database backends: OIDs are not replicated, and there are no hard guarantees against external modifications taking your databases out of sync.<p>As an alternative, you can use Point-In-Time-Recovery (PITR), also known as ""log shipping"", to transfer copies of your write-ahead log files from a master server to a warm standby. PITR allows you to have an exact replica of your master database, modulo whatever delay you incur in the log transfer itself.<p>For those who haven't aren't familiar with write-ahead logs, they function much like the logging in modern filesystems: changes are written there before being flushed to disk, so any incomplete transactions can be replayed from the logs if the server goes down unexpectedly.<p>Of course, the log-shipping method doesn't allow your secondary server to serve as a read-only replica as MySQL's built-in replication does. Largely for that reason, (depending on your workload and requirements, of course) MySQL may be a better choice. However, I've found Postgres PITR to be an excellent option for low to medium-traffic databases in those cases where I'm willing to trade the possibility of the loss of a few seconds' updates for guarantees that my DDL, object identities, and constraints will be maintained consistently between my replicas.<p>For those who are curious, the PostgreSQL docs online have a decent introduction into the use of write-ahead logs for replication and backups:<p><a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/wal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/wal.html</a>",1234309721

476189,comment,471660,471660,0,0,massung,,,"Paul, this was another good essay.<p>However, I have to fundamentally disagree with the idea that identity makes one ""stupid."" When I was a teenager, I had very little in the way of identity, but I was very stupid. :-)<p>There are many parts of a person's identity. Some are chosen, while others are factual. I can't change who my parents are, what my race is, or where I was born. But they do make up who I am and who you are. We cannot ignore them, and trying to do so causes other problems later in life.<p>Chosen aspects of one's identity are neither bad nor ""stupid."" Rather, the reasons people incorporate and cling to certain identities may be, and are the root of the problems you describe.<p>Example: Atheism vs. Religion.<p>Electing to identifying with one's self with either of these groups does not [inherently] make one smarter, dumber, stronger, or weaker. What's important is _why_ one chooses to identify with that group.<p>Does one choose religion to fill a hole in their life or perhaps a fear of death?<p>If so, then having that identity (hopefully) adds value to, and makes them happier; that's fantastic! But that reason also means when another - opposing identity - challenges their religion, they are threatening that happiness. Defense ensues.<p>Does one choose atheism in order to feel smarter or to be different/non-conformist?<p>If so, then when someone with a religious identity tries to talk with them about it, their intellect or uniqueness is suddenly threatened. Defense ensues.<p>Yet there are many people who have identified themselves as religious, and others as atheist, who are perfectly capable of having very pleasant conversations about life, the universe, and everything, together, for many hours. Why is that? Because their identity wasn't chosen to fill a void, to provide direction, or convince them of something. Instead, it was because that is what made the most sense to them. They are still excited to learn more, and are capable of stating ""I don't know [everything].""<p>Identity is a very _good_ thing. Just be sure you choose your identity for the right reasons.<p>Jeff M.",1234309013

While fb news feeds tell me what's going on with my friends ON fb, the only out-of-band reminder I have is just birthdays.<p>I thought about this for a long time, and I need it.  Problem is, I'm not sure if anyone else really does.  And even if they do, people might not admit to using it, which makes for a distribution problem.<p>Thoughts?",1234307096

I could see Linux stripped down to perform this task--having all computers appear to all operating systems as the exact same hardware might push some distinct advantages along with it. For example, a network is a network is a network; it would be the hypervisor worrying about if it was a wi-fi one or a cell modem or whatever, and then providing a clean API for any additional features one might have over the other (connecting to APs for wifi.)\nActually, picturing this further, it would be perfect if the hypervisor exported all its APIs over 9P. Any extra features would be immediately discoverable.",1234307058

Websites like zillow.com make a real estate agents role largely obsolete, yet they still try to command a huge commission on every sale.  Another poster above mentioned Title Insurance as well.<p>I suspect over the next 5-10 years we will see major changes in this industry.  Huge savings to home buyers & sellers are available if the bureaucracy and traditions can be broken and replaced with a more consumer friendly system.",1234306919

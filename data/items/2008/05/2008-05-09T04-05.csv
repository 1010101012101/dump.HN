185224,comment,184932,185178,0,0,smhinsey,,,"You could end up biasing your community towards the mundane (the digg/fark model) if you aren't careful, but what I'm thinking about is something that instead of rewarding people who are ""good voters"" (for lack of a better term) instead seeks to reward those community members who consistently support high quality contributions.<p>I define ""karma"" as a means of valuing your contributions to the community, and it seems that this ought not be dominated simply by what you contribute in a literal sense, but also in what you contribute by encouraging others by voting up their valuable contributions. If our definitions differ, I can see that being the cause of the disagreement.",1210308865

If you are serious about learning it and learning about the culture, I'd heavily recommend you go live there for a while.<p>There are tons of great intensive Spanish programs both in Spain and Latin America that are cheap (mine was $3000 for four months, including an apartment and 20 hours of class a week). I have maybe eight months total of language education and I already speak better than people I know in their senior year of a Spanish major.",1210308730

I am talking of users inviting other users to try out a web service. I am particularly impressed with linkedin. The invitations from linkedin work quite effectively. Invitations from other social networking services are mostly ignored. Is it something about the subject line that can make it or break it.<p>Any thoughts on it?",1210308100

I'm going over some of the ""Getting Started"" stuff in our app right now and am just wondering what all of you think about an initial guide to help jumpstart the use of an app. I come from the web world (im an xhtml/css hacker, designer) so I don't know too much about typical/best practices in terms of app development.<p>Its my personal belief that we've accomplished our mission of a user can come right into our app and quickly, without the need of a guide, understand where to go and what to do. What do you guys think? We're doing something pretty edgy (never done before, new concept, etc...) so it might be necessary in this case.<p>Ideas? Thoughts? <i>Any</i> hidden resources out there for good practices RE: mac apps would be great!",1210306550

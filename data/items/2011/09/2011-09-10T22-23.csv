2982710,comment,2981939,2981939,1,0,RyanKearney,,,"I think I remember reading an Intel article about something like this not too long ago. You can't just do this because of a few factors. When you start stacking the die like this, the latency grows. You now have to wait for signals to travel up through multiple processor die before it gets to the die that will process the instruction. It's this reason that you end up with diminishing returns when making processors ""taller"".<p>Not only that, but unless you can increase the speed of the FSB by 100 times, you will have a serious bottleneck between the processor and the motherboard. You're now funneling 100 CPU's worth of information through a socket and medium designed for 1 CPU.",1315695093
2982709,comment,2981393,2982580,1,0,DougWebb,,,"<p><pre><code>    <div data-role=""user"">\n        <span data-role=""name"">...</span>\n        <span data-role=""email"">...</span>\n    </div>\n</code></pre>\nIn general, I agree with you that XHTML isn't a great format for structured data. One advantage that XML has over JSON is the ability to attach attributes to data elements. I find that useful, and much easier to use than JSON's best alternative which is to turn a simple data element into a dictionary object.<p><pre><code>    { key: ""value"" }\n\n    { key: { attr1: ""attr1val"", attr2: ""attr2val"", value: ""value"" } }\n\n    <div>value</div>\n\n    <div attr1=""attr1val"" attr2=""attr2val"">value</div>\n</code></pre>\nIn the XML markup, you can retrieve the value the same way in both cases. With the JSON markup you have to use different syntax to retrieve the value depending upon whether or not there are attributes, which means you'll wind up always using nested objects if the attributes are optional, just to have consistent syntax.<p>What's odd about this is that in Javascript, attributes (aka Properties) can be attached to anything. You want your string variable to have some properties? No problem. You want some of those properties to be functions? Go for it. You want your function to have methods? Enjoy. I'm surprised that JSON didn't include this capability, since it exists in Javascript and is also a big distinguishing factor between JSON and XML.<p>Getting back to hyperlinks as a datatype, JSON uses ""\" for strings, [] for lists, {} for dictionaries/objects, and key: value for key/value pairs. Why not add &lt;...> for hyperlinks as a special kind of string? The ... could just be a url, or it could be a url followed by a comma-separated list of standard attributes like rel=""..."" and label=""..."". It's a small addition, but I think if it was right there in the markup syntax it would become widely used, and software which parses and works with JSON could depend upon it being there and build higher-level functionality on top of it.",1315695045

I don't have to do that for strings, numbers, lists, or dictionaries because those are standard datatypes in JSON. I think we're at a point now where hyperlinks should be a standard datatype too.<p>A second-best alternative would be a standard way to express hyperlinks in JSON using the existing datatypes. I don't think a key:value pair with a key named 'url' is sufficient though; hyperlinks need metainfo so you can differentiate them from each other and give them semantic meaning, like the 'rel' attribute does in xhtml. I think labels are important too, though they're not always needed.<p>The problem with this approach is that it's reinventing RDF and XLink in JSON, and RDF and XLink have already failed to be broadly adopted. I think part of the problem with them is the need for an add-on interpreter in addition to the syntax interpreter.

Otherwise you'd have a pretty strange time explaining interference (""oh, one thing is real, but it considers the other possibilities anyways"" or ""oh no, the waveform hasn't collapsed just yet, but it will once we observe it""). In fact, the Feynman path integral, i.e. the sum over all histories, appeals a lot to me on a conceptual level.<p>But that isn't the point really. I just feel like saying ""oh, it's in some weird quantum state of being both this and that at the same time"" is a bit disingenuous, since it is not true in any classical sense, which, shockingly, most people would assume and get utterly confused. It is necessarily true if you consider many worlds as the valid interpretation (which I do like, but let's not go there), but it doesn't I think hint that well enough, nor does it hint that we have entered a cloud of possibilities that is about to collapse if that was the point.<p>More than just being clear on what is physically happening (and I do say ""oh, it's just equations, they have no meaning"" is the biggest hand waving of all), it feels kind of immature. The tone hints to a confusion in the speaker, as if we've just gotten these strange experimental results and we're not sure how to deal with them yet. It's something that could've been acceptable when practically nothing was known about quantum mechanics, but more than half a century later?<p>And to be perfectly fair, I'm not sure how you would phrase the wavefunction / amplitude distribution to at least give someone without knowledge of the subject a workable model.

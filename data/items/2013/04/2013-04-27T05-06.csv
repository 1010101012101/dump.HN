I knew that I'd like to learn more Foundation, so immediately submitted my email address. But I would suggest that a decent slice of your users don't know what they don't know - ie. that there is a Bootstrap alternative that is just as flexible, powerful, and easy to learn. Getting those people three steps down the path before giving them a hurdle of signup would, in my opinion, result in a larger user count and greater project impact in the long run.",1367042250

And ultimately, to record and act on those notifications.<p>In terms of moderation, one might argue that it is a form of reactive moderation. But I would not argue that, as there is no expression of an editorial policy in handling notifications based on legal merit and only intervening in site content when notified.",1367042214

Then I picked a major that I didn't really care for, because I didn't know any better ...<p>I breezed through the first few years of college taking general classes and the introductory classes to my major, but even then the cracks were beginning to show in my choice of major, I'd score B's where I thought I'd get A's and ever so often I'd come really close to getting C's.<p>When I hit the senior level courses, those B's turned to C's and ever so often I'd almost get a D.<p>Why the decline in performance?  Nothing had changed, except what I was studying. I didn't care for it, and it didn't play to any of my academic strengths (lots of math which I simply don't have the patience for), so I couldn't just cruise through them.<p>When I graduated college, I had a very decent general GPA (in the low 3's), but it was only so because of my strong early performance in college, my major GPA was in the 2's. I was so ashamed that I didn't attend my own graduation and wouldn't let my family come either. I withdrew a little bit from friends and life, because I felt I had let down a lot of people and was a bit of a failure.<p>3 years later I discovered something I truly loved (programming and building things) and after many years of excelling at it ...

The statistics you cite, while perhaps factually correct are basically meaningless. D.C. is not a very diverse city from a socioeconomic standpoint. There are basically two sides to D.C.- a metro area where everything looks new and clean, people are well-heeled, and housing is expensive. Ballston, Arlington, Georgetown, DuPont, Bethesda. They are all just expensive variations on the same theme- one community after another of well-paid, highly-educated people.<p>Outside D.C. on the eastern and southern edges just inside Maryland is the D.C. that brings those averages into the territory you are citing. They add no practical value to a discussion of the city's economic health for those fortunate enough to not have any exposure to that side of the city. To consider that relevant to the discussion is like saying the average pay in a Fortune-500 company is $50k to counter the point that C-level execs of a Fortune-500 company are overpaid. While it may be statistically accurate, it is for all intents and purposes a meaningless data point in the discussion. What a first-year business analyst earns has absolutely fuck-all to do with what the CEO earns.<p>The assumption I'm making is that a person who has above-average skill will do exceptionally well in an economically-strong area like D.C. when compared to a city with a small or sluggish economy.",1367041834

5616933,comment,5616541,5616541,20,0,bobsy,,,"The problem is that Riot's implementations have completely failed at solving the problem.<p>By promoting reporting now a lot of the abuse has turned into threatening to report each other. Where before new players would be called shit. Now they are threatened for being bad. There is actually a report option for reporting a new player.. this makes many new players give up because they feel it is against the rules to have no idea what they are doing.<p>The Tribunal while a nice idea doesn't work. Riot's implementation has a rating system  where judges are ranked based on their accuracy. That means many people punish based on what they think other people are doing instead of making their own decision. On each case there is no requirement to spend a specific time looking at it. No requirement to read all the text. I know people who punish every case without reading and run at 90% accuracy on the league table.<p>Another issue with the tribunal is that it punishes for almost anything. If you say GG after 9 minutes... its punishable. If end the game saying gg easy... its punishable. Combine this with the fact that enemies can report you without specifying a reason means a percentage of players who get punished shouldn't be in the tribunal to begin with. Combine this with terrible support... getting unpunished means going on Reddit and hoping a Riot employee spots it..<p>At best Riot have shifted the problem from verbal abuse to threatening to report. At worst they have failed completely.<p>The two main flash points are before you can play ranked games and have a new account. The second one is in champion select...<p>If you are banned you make a new account. If you want a second account you make a new account. This means the game for new players is incredibly toxic. About 50% of new players are people on smurf's or banned players leveling. This leads to a lot of frustration when you have a 20 death ally on your team. There are a bunch of things they could do.<p>1. Add a tip pointing out a mute button exists... It took me 80 games of randomly being shit on before someone told me about the mute button. If someone starts to spout abuse I just click the ignore button. Problem sorted.<p>2. They could give headstart smurf accounts to people who tick an option saying they are experienced players. This would help noobie players play against each other and have a soft intro to the game.<p>3. They could improve the tutorial so players actually start with some idea of what they are doing.<p>4. They could make the early climb on new accounts start versus bots to force people to actually get a feel for the game before throwing them into PvP<p>All 4 solutions would ease the problem new users are facing.<p>Another issue is in games where 2 or more people want to play the same position while picking champions. A lot of people say 'mid or feed'. They want the mid position. If they don't get it they will repeatedly let the enemy kill them in game...<p>Simple solutions...<p>1. Implement a dice in champion select to allow people to roll for the same position.<p>2. Simply add a line of text when people enter champion select that position is given in order. If you are first pick you have first pick of position. It is up to you if you want to give it up.<p>There isn't a single tip that says ""if you ally is having a hard time in lane, consider aiding them rather than criticizing them.""<p>The attitude of league at the moment is ""if you playing bad you are spoiling my game and I will abuse / threaten to report you for it.""<p>When you actually take the effort to communicate with your team and your team actually aids weaker players the mood in games greatly improves. The trouble is that Riot provides little guidance on doing this.<p>For all their research the implementations based on the research sucks.",1367041114

A VC firm could improve their returns by at most 2x or 3x by extracting really good terms from an inexperienced founder.

Google and Facebook are among the biggest recent hits for VCs.  Both had young founders.

5616928,comment,5616786,5616786,11,0,hkmurakami,,,"I was probably fortunate that this kind of frustration came much earlier in my life. In elementary school, I basically never studied for any exams other than memorization-style spelling and vocab tests. I excelled at math but was mediocre at best at everything else. I distinctly remember getting a 17/100 on a 5th grade, take home, open book history test. (actually, the only reason I was good at math was because I went to my normal ""American"" school 5 days a week and a separate ""Japanese expat"" school on Saturdays and had double the math hours as all my peers)<p>I also remember when things changed for me, and had OP's ""I can do better"" moment. It was in 7th grade when I got my first B in math in my life (Algebra) and narrowly escaped a C in Civics (I think I got a 79.6). While not ""disastrous"" marks by any means, it was still incredibly jarring for a generally studious kid who always turned in his homework on time, wrote his papers, tried hard, etc.<p>Looking back, it's strange that the almost-C bothered me, since I think I had some Cs during elementary school. Maybe I had instinctively known that in Junior High, the stakes were somehow higher. But more importantly, my new friends were getting straight A's, and I knew that there was no reason I couldn't do just as well as them. Also, I knew that I was ""good at math"" and that I should of course be able to get an A in the subject. Of course, I had basically never studied in my life, so it was growing pains figuring out how I can do well in history/literature/spanish exams.<p>I somehow managed to figure out a studying method that worked for me and it was good enough to get me near straight A's throughout the rest of Junior High. My High School was the same as my JH, so knowing ""the system"", I was able to do similarly well in HS. The biggest difference that I can see between OP and myself is that my ""on"" switch was flipped 6-7 years before OP's, which allowed me to turn on the after burners while I still wasn't too far behind my peers and still had enough time to catch up.<p>However, I was definitely not the most efficient or the smartest in my class, and was probably putting in the most time out of anyone in my grade. Two guys were definitely much much <i>smarter</i> than me and I knew it, despite my having higher grades than either of them. To this day they are two of my closest friends.<p>Looking at the ""traits"" OP describes in the studious types is really interesting to me. I procrastinated like crazy and played video games for an obscene number of hours (I would frequently borrow a RPG + the console from a friend on friday, finish the ~25 hour game over the weekend and return it to him on monday). I remember playing FF7 before it was even out in the states (since all my consoles were Japanese region) for over 300 hours and had amassed so much ""gil"" (money) in the game that the number was overflowing out the left side of the menu window. But it's true that I have always performed well under pressure (I always did better on the actual standardized exams than my practice exams) and put in pointlessly long hours studying the course material until I knew (almost) everything (combined with the massive hours of video gaming and extracurricular activities I had, I would often only get 3 hours of sleep/night which is just pure idiocy).<p>But what do I have to show at the end of it all? Honestly the result is a book smart'ish and tool'ish person who can't build anything to save his life anymore, a far cry from the kid who would tinker around and build stuff when he was 8~10 years old. I do <i>extremely</i> well within the defined framework of an academic setting, but I highly doubt that I'd outperform this significantly doing anything ""in the real world"" (I probably do outperform the ""average"" to some extent, but definitely not to the degree I did as a student). Hindsight is 20/20, but it would have served me much better to have focused on what I enjoyed most: drawing, tinkering around with techy stuff, etc rather than devote thousands of hours to cramming academic material into my brain.<p>So even if you ""succeed"" in the academic rat race, it's not really useful unless you're going to use those supposed ""accomplishments"" in the future (ex: go into consulting/ibanking where academic pedigree and GPA is heavily considered).<p>I'm not really sure what I'm trying to say anymore, but as a person who managed a breakthrough from a position similar to the OP (and there are quite a few people in the top colleges who didn't study hard at all to get their perfect marks -- definitely not me), I can say that it's not necessarily useful to succeed at this either. In fact getting a wake up call 4+ years earlier might turn out to be a blessing.",1367040916

Not everybody is a genius, or even bright. Nor everybody needs to be one. You can do amazing things without having been an straight A student. How do I know? I graduated with a GPA of 2.16. Yep. 2.16. Guess what? I am a programmer who enjoys his work, make a very, very good living, and have managed to build a coupe of profitable businesses. All while being an average guy.<p>I used to think that being smart was the thing to be. Not anymore. What you need to be is resilient. While a smart person pauses to analyze, I keep trying and trying until I get it. No pause needed.<p>Go on. Live your life. Love the gifts you have and put them to good use. Don't measure yourself by how you compare to others. But how you compare to your own past. Keep moving. Be resilient.",1367040687

Ask the typical person if they could retire right now, what would they do? Doing leisure activities, going on trips, relaxing, etc. can only take one so far. As human beings we need to be productive (no matter how that is defined) for us to lead a healthy life.<p>I believe the bigger issue is freedom. MMM's approach is very extreme and works for him. I do believe he lives on much more than 25K and works very hard. To him, the work he does might not classify as work. This is freedom for him. He is building a brand and knows how to market his brand.<p>The big difference I would suggest is that he is absolutely debt-free. American consumerism and lifestyle, to some extent, is driven by credit. Getting a credit card has become a rite of passage.<p>I like to follow the Dave Ramsey (<a href=""http://www.daveramsey.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daveramsey.com</a>) philosophy (I don't agree with all his advice but most of it is pretty sound). I've just come across Dave over the past year and I find his message and life story inspiring. His message is simple:<p>1) Get out of debt (goal is to be entirely out of debt - including house). Only acceptable debt is mortgage debt. 
2) Cut-up your credit cards (I don't. Having self-control with this is a big part of it)
3) Save 3-6 months emergency fund
4) Invest 15% every year for retirement
5) Save a percentage for Kid's college
5) Buy a house that is within 25-30% of your monthly income
6) Buy cars, boats, etc (ie. toys) that is no more than half of your total income (at most)
7) Invest your money (He's a big believer in mutual funds which I believe ETFs are now a better choice) 
8) Most importantly, stay out of debt.<p>In this way, if you are making 100K a year or more going out for a $200 dinner or a $10K trip is fine since you are out of debt and all the major priorities are covered.<p>In some sense, MMM's message is the same as Dave's but the difference is that Dave is a multi-millionaire and works just as hard as he did when he wasn't. He has no qualms about going out for dinner and spending $1000 as this puts no dent in his net worth.",1367040106

System styles and UI are rarely designed for ""small form"" applications that need to pack a lot of features into a very small, non-descript space.<p>WinAmp's themes went above and beyond, of course, but those were at the user's discretion.",1367039106

They have python/ruby bootstrap programs in San Francisco, and once in a while we'd discover a future CalTech prof, or something like that.<p>There was one woman who worked in an art gallery, and if i remember correctly, didn't even own a computer but only needed everything explained once re: vim, python, linux etc.  It was definitely nontrivial stuff, and then she could put up working code, just like that.",1367038907
5616862,comment,5614629,5615683,2,0,cantankerous,,,"Yeah I think you're coming from a pretty big write-once run anywhere perspective here.  This is especially the case with CURL.  Languages like Ruby would have similar issues if they didn't have the force from their communities to bolster the language.  It's sort of an unfortunate truth to Haskell that it's development tools aren't so polished as something like RubyGems.  That said, I've found that the time I save writing decent Haskell far surpasses the time I spend mucking with its internals, though I've been at it for 5 or so years now.  Honestly, though, you're right about the Windows bit.  The GHC implementation for Windows relies on tools that I personally would avoid using (MinGW) given the option of using their more mature bretheren in their native environments (LLVM/GCC/Linux/OS X).  I've found that probably the best Linux distro to use Haskell with ease has been Arch Linux hands down.<p>All in all, no, its package system is no RubyGems or what-have-you, but I think the (IMO) language makes it worth it.<p>HN may hate me forever for saying this, but after using Haskell, I could never imagine switching to a LISP.  There's too many thumbnail clippings involved, and not enough types ;-).",1367038897

But yes, the traditional Jewish thought is very different than whatever Rand ever wrote.",1367038838

It was probably one of the best summaries of the topic on the Internet at one time.<p>It's gone, redirects to ""cold chills"" [1] which is not only incorrect, it's a far inferior article to begin with.<p>Having given up on contributing or editing things in WP due to the rampant and frustrating deletionism I have no idea how to even begin the labyrinthine process of getting the old article returned. The only thing I can find of it is a history where sometime in 2007 it was marked for redirection...but I know that it worked at least through 2010 and into 2011 (my own comment history has a link to it back then).<p>1 - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisson</a>",1367870377

In theory they all probably work, even for your hardware, but getting the right versions of all the software necessary running at once on your machine is a pain.<p>It doesn't have anything to do with paying the people who work on Linux, it's that the manufacturers of these devices don't have a commercial interest in making their hardware work in 30 different Linux distributions.  They do have an interest in their products working flawlessly on all versions of OS X and Windows, and so they do what it takes to make it happen.<p>Linux-based systems are great, but not when it comes to desktops where productivity is the point.

They want a better API for traversal, filtering, events, manipulation (incl. CSS), and so on. In that light, you might actually <i>want</i> a language where higher-order functions are possible.<p>Also, it's a bit contradictory to argue that you could replace JS with any programming language <i>and</i> simultaneously argue that JS is garbage. In fact, if you simply swapped in Ruby, your argument would be largely the same; you'd still be stuck with the DOM and CSS.<p>JS isn't a perfect language. The latest disappointment for me is the lack of any well-defined module or namespace system; it forces people into ad-hoc solutions when Python, Ruby, or other dynamic languages have pretty good systems.<p>But there's nothing egregiously bad about the language, at least IMHO. What the author really seems to hate is web development, including CSS and the DOM, and probably the fact that they hardly have any choice. (Not coincidentally, I suspect this is why many people have problems with JS. I am sympathetic.) I suppose something nuanced like that makes for a less linkbait-y headline, however.",1367870255

This is a communication problem, not a technical problem. No one gets upset that OS X won't run on a random Acer netbook from 4 years ago because Apple has made clear that their OS is only supposed to work on their hardware.<p>GNU/Linux evangelists, on the other hand, have, in the past especially, had a tendency to sell their operating system as magical software that works on every machine always.

People find him incredibly biased and the vote of all Wikipedia in early 2006 for ArbCom members kicks him out.  But Wales is not happy with this and decides to stuff ArbCom, like FDR threatened to stuff the Supreme Court.  So Wales creates a new ArbCom seat.  Does he appoint the Wikipedia-wide next highest voted neutral editor to ArbCom?  No, he reappoints this Arab and Muslim hating editor JayJG.<p>You can find many examples of this sort of thing.

Mathematical notation is now universal. A student in China learns in middle school (junior high) most of the mathematical notation that an American is expected to learn by graduation from high school. I know a large number of Chinese people who have taken the GRE test for admission to United States graduate schools. All of them, even those pursuing graduate studies in humanities, deride the GRE math section as ""junior high math,"" which it literally is in terms of the standard school curriculum in China. Not all people in China have access to schooling beyond junior high, but through junior high the instruction in mathematics is generally excellent, and the United States could learn from the methods of mathematics teaching used in schools in China.<p><a href=""http://stuff.mit.edu:8001/afs/athena/course/6/6.969/OldFiles/www/readings/ma-review.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stuff.mit.edu:8001/afs/athena/course/6/6.969/OldFiles...</a><p><a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/199908/rev-howe.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/199908/rev-howe.pdf</a><p>Second things second. There is indeed a distinction between doing the kinds of calculations in arithmetic that may be tested in elementary school, are often done by adults with electronic calculators, and may or may not be a practiced skill of professional mathematicians and the kind of mathematical reasoning that makes up university-level study of mathematics and quantitative sciences. But that is not to say that learning arithmetic is not important. W. Stephen Wilson, a professor of mathematics at Johns Hopkins University, surveyed mathematics researchers about a year after the webpage submitted here was written, and asked them to agree or disagree with the statement<p>""In order to succeed at freshmen mathematics at my college/university, it is important to have knowledge of and facility with basic arithmetic algorithms, e.g. multiplication, division, fractions, decimals, and algebra, (without having to rely on a calculator.""<p><a href=""http://www.math.jhu.edu/~wsw/ED/list"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.jhu.edu/~wsw/ED/list</a><p>His colleagues around the world unanimously agreed, answered him in terms such as<p>""I am shocked that there is any issue here.

I do not know even one university-level teacher of mathematics who would disagree with it. I would be truly astonished to meet a person who disagrees.""<p>The charming story about Kummer is one I tell my own students, but I also tell them that the mathematics I teach them (prealgebra mathematics, in a class for self-selected elementary-age pupils looking for a challenging mathematics course) is based on their doing their own calculations with their minds alone, or with pencil and paper, never with a calculator.<p>Other mathematicians point out that learning the long division algorithm is itself a basis for the development of mathematical understanding.<p><a href=""http://www.csun.edu/~vcmth00m/longdivision.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csun.edu/~vcmth00m/longdivision.pdf</a><p>The late mathematician W.

I wish I had had a good one.'"" W. W. Sawyer, Vision in Elementary Mathematics (1964), page 5.<p>Sawyer didn't want parents to give their children an excuse for thinking ""I don't have a head for mathematics."" Instead, a learner can keep searching for an effective teacher, and learn more than at first seems possible. The curriculum expectations in much of the English-speaking world are meager. In both Singapore and Taiwan (and in some other countries), every seventh grader is expected to learn algebra, and a fair amount of geometry--even all of the below-average students. That is possible. Not everyone in those countries is brilliant in mathematics, but many, many people in those countries have a day-by-day correct understanding of mathematics that helps in their daily life activities.

Unless you have a card without a driver (exceedingly rare, though it's not uncommon to need a recent kernel to use recent hardware) ALSA pretty much Just Works. For complex features like streaming sound over the network you need PulseAudio, which due to its complexity takes more configuration and setup, but that's done out of the box on a fair number of distros. I don't know of any major software that requires OSS (though if I'm not mistaken it's still the preferred solution for BSD and therefore often available as an option), and only professional software uses JACK; users of JACK generally buy high-end hardware specifically for that purpose and know what they're doing.<p>So there are three major components for different purposes. Core audio support is the domain of ALSA itself and Linux does a good job with it. PulseAudio provides advanced capabilities on top of the more basic/hardware-oriented functionality in ALSA, and JACK provides low-latency audio for realtime applications that need it (not games, only really audio processing equipment). With large amounts of work the partial redundancy between these components could be removed, but it's really not a big issue; for desktop or professional use getting things to work right isn't too hard.",1367868658

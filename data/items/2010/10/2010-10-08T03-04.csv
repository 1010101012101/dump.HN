I think that Seldo was contradicting the popular image that since Zuckerberg built some 'tech thing' and that it's really successful that he's some sort of 'genius hacker.' This is completely different from the sentiment that Zuckerberg is some sort of 'chump that just got lucky.'<p>Personally, I think the idea that he is some sort of 'hacker genius' stems from the fact that the vast majority of the people that use Facebook, are probably the same type of people that thought I was a 'hacker genius' for showing them how to change their wallpaper or use Alt-Tab to switch between windows.<p>It comes down to some equation like:<p><pre><code>  do something related to X + gain success/fame/money = genius at X
</code></pre>
Whereas that's not necessarily the case. You wouldn't put the person that developed Netflix's recommendation algorithm up with Einstein or Euler, but that's not to say that he/she isn't smart or 'just got lucky.'<p>Other people posts here seem to just be related to fighting the assertion that Zuckerberg gave Facebook success due to some genius piece of code. This assertion detracts from all of the rest of the stuff that made Facebook a success (business decisions, etc), any one of which had the potential to sink Facebook.<p><i>tl;dr</i> Zuckerberg did a lot of things and made Facebook through a lot of hard work, but the moniker 'genius hacker' is not fitting. That is not a criticism of Zuckerberg so much as it is a criticism of the MSM (or just people in general) trying to boil the success of Facebook down to a single thing (the code) and claim that Zuckerberg's success must make him a genius at the one thing.",1286510266

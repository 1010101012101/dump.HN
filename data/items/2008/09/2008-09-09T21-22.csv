Even among older users, the vast majority are aware of the difference between a client application and a website.</i><p>That was equality, not identity! It's a terminology thing. Yes, they know the difference between the internet and their browser certainly, but I know people who more or less <i>refer</i> to IE as ""the internet."" It's part of the name, after all. I think they generally call the net itself either ""the web"" or ""online."" Obviously I'm pulling from a small data set, but nonetheless, IE does give the impression on the outside that it's the authoritative browser, much as Google's homepage does for search.",1220997501

Read up on Enron's repo agreements. They raised cash by selling assets near the end of the quarter, and promising to buy them back at the start of the quarter -- it was underhanded, but it still showed up as operating cash flow. They did this for t-bills, Nigerian barges, and everything in between. Cash flow quality is higher than earnings quality, but it is by no means perfect.",1220996895

299853,comment,299243,299347,0,0,rflrob,,,"In this case, it would destroy that myth by saying that expensive diesel cars are <i>also</i> a way to get fuel efficiency.  An imported version of their car would cost slightly more than a Prius (arguably the iconic hybrid) in direct outlays.  Plus, with diesel being more expensive than gasoline, you could well have a more expensive car in the long run.  If the fuel costs 10-20% more, you need to get 10-20% better fuel efficiency.  Assuming Prius mileages around 50 mpg, you can do this, but only barely, and that's assuming the relative price of diesel stays the same.",1220995213

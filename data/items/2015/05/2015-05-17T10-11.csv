That&#x27;s a trope/common theme in Japanese horror movies. It&#x27;s been done in 3 different ju-on (grudge) films, 2 scissor mouth lady movies (scissor lady is an urban legend in japan, like bloody mary), and a half-dozen other anthology-type movies.",1431860327

</code></pre>
<i>GOOD</i> GUIs are nice for discoverability, and the same is true for CLIs. There are many GUIs that are absolutely horrid, which rely on non-obvious icons or assume certain usage styles and offer no assistance if you don&#x27;t have the same background assumptions as the GUI&#x27;s creator.<p>Having used many different types of programs over the last ~30 years, I have wasted far more time with bad GUIs than I have with bad CLIs. At least with the CLI I can grep the output or documentation for what I want. I cannot grep a menu or GUI form to find some option I&#x27;ve forgotten the name of.<p>What this comes down to is that it is fairly easy to make a good GUI for <i>simple</i> things, and good programmers can make a nice GUI for the moderate and complex tasks. This is where discoverability is primarily useful, as it assists the inexperienced user and the dilettante.<p>For those of us that want to use our computer in a far more serious way, what the UNIX style CLI (shell) provides us is an interface that is still very learnable (IFF you invest in the time it takes to read the documentation!), that enables crafting commands that are simply not practical in any GUI. If you don&#x27;t believe this, tell me how I can, for example:<p><pre><code>    - recursively walk an arbitrary directory tree of images at ($SRCDIR)
    - except for any dirfectgory that ends in &#x27;.backup&#x27;
    - finding any file that is NOT a PNG, 
    - convert that that file into a PNG
    - but saving the new files in new directory tree ($DSTDIR),
      creating any necessary parent directories
</code></pre>
That would be a mess in any GUI. In bash + imagemagick, it would be:<p><pre><code>    for i in &quot;${SRCDIR}/**/!(*.backup)/!(*.png) ; do
        dst=&quot;${DSTDIR}${i#${SRCDIR}}&quot;
        mkdir -p &quot;$(dirname &quot;${dst}&quot;)&quot;
        convert &quot;${i}&quot; &quot;${i%.*}.png&quot;
    done
</code></pre>
Yes, that&#x27;s ugly, but at least it is possible.",1431860311

Compare Go&#x27;s specification with other languages (maybe other than Scheme).<p>Complex specifications often root in way more complex problems. A common problem is for example C++ code, which already is complex being ported to Java, where you end up having side effects from stuff like NUL-delimited strings suddenly not being not delimited and so on.<p>I relatively frequently stumble across code that show a complete misunderstanding of a language. It&#x27;s really common and often leads to strange work around that manifest the view of programmers not completely understanding the language they are using. Removing hundreds of lines of work around code and pointing out a mistake made usually looks quite impressive.<p>However I do not want to deny that specifications should try to avoid such behavior. I do not deny the fact that this isn&#x27;t optimal, but neither are so many other things (see float). What I think is important is to actually acknowledge that things are not optimal and therefor there should be ways to get around them. append is really nice, because with that one bit of knowledge you end up with one single simple rule on how to program.<p>The problem that sometimes occurs is that you have rules about a language that go like &quot;If you stumble across this problem the way to solve it depends on ...&quot;. So you actually have more side cases.<p>Also that simple append is maybe something that probably should be warned about cause it is really, really likely an error. This is another reason I think simple, general statements that have such side effects are good, or at least better than needing to know a lot about a language.<p>What I want to point out with that is that I think that one should judge a language after how it works out for one after one year of seriously working with it on a day by day basis. I really don&#x27;t think this will end up as a practical issue. Finding something that is different in any language and might be confusing for people not confident in a language is really easy, but can also give you a completely wrong impression.<p>This is true for Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, ... On the other hand it mostly happens when there is a hype about a language, which totally makes sense. It&#x27;s also got to point out that this new language is also not the golden shot, because it stops especially inexperienced programmers from following every new hype coming up.",1431859053

I&#x27;ve spoken to people who worked there and heard how crushing it was to know that someone was getting screwed but to be totally unable to do anything about it because the policy dictated their reaction. And I&#x27;ve worked with charities and listened to the other end of those phone calls; people screaming that their kids are going to be taken away because their benefits have been delayed and they can&#x27;t afford to feed them.<p>The underlying assumption of this piece seems to be that turning decision making over to algorithms reduces positive discretion. But the humans in these situations frequently have no more discretion than the machine does, and inefficiency also has a human cost. It seems false to me to pretend that what these algorithms are doing, at least in terms of the majority of their immediate effect, is qualitatively different.<p>What you&#x27;re losing when you encode something as an algorithm is the insight that you get from having humans in the loop. Intuition; the things that people haven&#x27;t thought to measure yet. That&#x27;s the weakness in any statistical technique - you need a human to lend numbers relevance; to say what is important to know the relationships of; otherwise they&#x27;re just a sequence of events.<p>But you need to start off with a system that leverages human strengths in order for that criticism to make sense. Human judgement only has an advantage in a system designed to use the different sorts of value that it offers. If your call centre worker is not truly responsible for the outcome of the call, and if you don&#x27;t regularly attempt to get feedback from them to inform policy decisions, then it makes no difference if they are replaced by a machine. They were being treated as one to begin with, and the value that they added to the organisation by virtue of being human; of having professional judgement; was being thrown away anyway.<p>All this does, in a lot of cases, is make existing flaws more obvious.<p>The exception I can think of to this is the criminal justice system, where there are examples of positive discretion. However, there are also examples of negative discretion there. There are many stupid laws on the books, and selectively enforcing those laws allows you to screw, more or less, whoever you want. It&#x27;s not surprising that a system that would mechanically implement those laws would produce undesirable outputs, it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s finally being applied to people who have the power to say something about it, (and, perhaps, have their concerns taken seriously enough to alter policy.)<p>For all that there is a loss in the case of the criminal justice system, there is also a gain: Encoding something as an algorithm makes the flaws in the process more apparent.",1431858688

In this case the humans deferred to the machines the decisions, most likely because the administrative regulations say so and leave no way to get around it &quot;manually&quot;.<p>I have myself encountered these sort of issues, at one point many years ago I stopped filing for unemployment because I had found a job, weeks later a computer decided that my job search records needed to be audited for the period I was not filing, and if that didn&#x27;t fly, they would want the last 6 months of UI back.  I filed a blank form with a letter saying I was employed and who to talk to to verify that.  This was based on advice of the employment department.  There was no process for this, so a blank job search form was entered and nothing else done, I then was subject to collection actions, appealed and an administrative law judge interviewed me, and determined the collection was in error.

The exception would be if you don&#x27;t intend to keep the new employee for too long anyway, but then that&#x27;s a bad sign for you business I think.",1431857734

There&#x27;s a lot of slack and human interpretation built into the process, and no laws are constructed such that they are enforced in a mechanical fashion. In addition, there&#x27;s the premise that the folks doing the work of enforcing the laws are virtually the same as those being policed. Finally, severely unjust or unpopular laws are many times ignored by both the population and the enforcers.<p>All of that goes away with machine application of criminal/administrative law.

9559415,comment,9557503,9558069,0,0,asQuirreL,,,"So the example I have in mind is that of a Randomised Binary Search Tree (or Treap, if you want). Its interface is pure, however it requires access to an RNG for insertions. Because of this, it cannot be treated as a pure collection: you need to tell the type system, hang on, this RBST carts around some state which changes when you insert to it, despite the fact that the state doesn&#x27;t change the extensional behaviour of the structure. This is a provable property, but maybe not provable by Haskell&#x27;s type system.<p>Now I know that you can hide unsafePerformIO in the interface, and in this case I expect it is fine, but this is not easy, it feels like a hack.<p>Another example that I have personally watched play itself out in disbelief was in a fairly large Haskell project: There was need of a lookup table, with some 10000 elements. In such cases, I would have stored the lookup in a database, or a separate file at least, but because they wanted to maintain purity so badly, the solution was to write a 10000 line long Haskell file. But wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if you could load a file and tell Haskell: don&#x27;t worry, this won&#x27;t change, so treat reads to this purely.<p>I never said such things were impossible, merely not easy, and I don&#x27;t believe this is by accident. I am almost certain that such things are made difficult to prevent abusing such features, but that doesn&#x27;t stop me from missing them :) .",1431856980

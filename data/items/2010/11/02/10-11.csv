It all depends - but ~$10k is average.<p>People have different opinions, but I believe that with a startup, especially in the early years, the CEO has to be actively involved in PR. You should build relationships with bloggers who cover your space and/or have an interest in your company. If you do this well, it is worth more than any amount of money you will spend on a PR agency (it will also give your company a more authentic voice, rather than a dozen re-bloggers regurgitating your releases).<p>In the case of Blekko, their PR agency would have contacted all the media outlets, setup the briefing times, but together the release and then followed up with each reporter. There is a lot that can go wrong, and it usually does. The blekko PR team should have known that with so many outlets covering this launch, the chances of somebody breaking the embargo and pissing off the other outlets was near 100%.<p>I sat through tons of briefings at TC, and when a blogger asks who else is covering the launch, you can gauge pretty quickly if the embargo is going to be broken or not. It is so frustrating when an embargo is broken, because you put the work in only for it to be wasted - and there are no repercussions for anybody breaking an embargo, which is why TC simply threw them out. It is a complicated world with a lot of internal industry politics between outlets, firms and companies and a good PR firm should be able to guide you through that (but most don't).<p>If you have a product launch coming up and you are trying to decide if you need PR or not, try emailing one or two bloggers now and let them know you have a launch coming up in 2-3 weeks (or whenever) and see the reaction. If you get nothing, you might need help with your messaging (the attention span of a blogger with an inbound cold email is around 7 seconds - so you need to be snappy). If you get interest, then handle it yourself and get to know the industry, which will be very important for you in the long-term (and something you should do even if you do have PR).<p>You should also be building your own profile with the company blog and perhaps your own personal blog. If you become a source of stories or links for a blogger you will find it easier to get your own stories out (quid pro quo).<p>If you need some tips feel free to email me (email in profile) - I both spent a long time at TC and in startups before that, and startup again now.",1288693611

It is not so hard to construct excludability, think of non-excludable goods such as fish, ""ideas"" for fiction, ""ideas"" for scientific research. They need to be linked to something, fish: best fishermen, fiction: best novelists like Stephen King get contracts without writing down a single word, research: a professor gets tenure. They just need to be linked to something excludable, e.g. to the person itself, or the service of a venture. (And I am still not talking about regulation, patents, etc!)<p>There is no market for venture ideas without the founders who are credible in executing them. Not because they are non-excludable, but because in fact they don't exist for a long time: it is very rare that somebody has an initial idea that won't change during building a company. Markets, customers, technology change.<p>If the world of startups would work like you say they do, it would be enough for the most creative persons to get a long term contract from VCs just to tell the ideas that pop out of their minds every morning..

Palantir will prepare you to do an enterprise startup, because that's what they are, 6 years down the line.<p>Ignore everyone who says that FaceBook will look better on a resume: that's only true if you work outside of the valley, and you don't want to start a tech startup outside of the valley.  Among people who matter (investors and key early engineers), Palantir's reputation is at least as good as FaceBook's.<p>Smaller company doesn't necessarily mean you'd learn more.  Interns learn a shit ton at Google, with its 25,000 employees, and I think you'd learn a lot at both FaceBook and Palantir.  The important variable here is how flat and open the internal culture of the company is.  There are startups where you have 10 people but the CEO never tells you a damn thing, and then there's Google where you have 25k people but full-timers can access just about everything (and even interns have pretty broad access and get exposed to a wide variety of technologies).<p>Really, I think the biggest decision is consumer vs. enterprise, and I don't think you're equipped to make that until you've worked for both (that's what internships are for :-)).  Personally, my first job out of college was a startup that sold enterprise software very similar to Palantir's to hedge funds.   I hated it - I wanted nothing to do with the financial industry, I found the enterprise sales cycle to be capricious and demoralizing, and I didn't like the feeling that we were beholden to a few very powerful and questionably moral customers.  I wanted to do consumer stuff, and I'm much, much happier now that I'm at a consumer company.

How are they going to know you can bring anything to table if you have nothing to show?<p>After I had identified a potential pain point and thought up a solution, this (in order) is how I proceeded.<p>I enrolled in a relevant classes (business fashion/intro to entrepreneurship), wrote a business plan/financial statement, figured out the features and how I wanted the app to work, contracted wireframe mockups, raised money from family, hired a lawyer to form a corporation, had the graphic design done, had the front end done.<p>It took a year and $4500 before I finally found my co-founder.<p>All the stuff had to be done anyways and it was stuff I, as a non tech-cofounder could do. After I met my technical co-founder we spent a week transferring knowledge (after working on it for a year, i had a lot to say) and now he is coding away.<p>Also everything took way longer then I expected.",1288692184

Apple or Microsoft could already use software updates to disable anything they don't like if they wished (and could probably do it far more subtly by introducing a minor incompatibility in the OS).  How is this any different?<p>The reason they don't completely screw people's machine isn't technical, it's commercial, it would be utter suicide.  That applies to Apple as much as anyone else and the app store doesn't change that (the kill switch for iOS has never been used in the three years it's been there).",1288692045

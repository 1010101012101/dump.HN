Considering the cost and assuming it works out, 30 years for procurement for the F-35 seems reasonable.<p>The SR71&#x27;s top speed was just over mach 3. The F-15 can reach mach 2.5. The Mig-25&#x27;s top speed is mach 2.8 but was clocked by the USA over Israel at Mach 3.2 (Yeah, the SR71 ain&#x27;t all that). Mig 31&#x27;s top speed is mach 2.83.<p>The F-22&#x27;s top speed is Mach 2.25.<p>The F-35 is a measly mach 1.6. I think this shift in priorities is revealing and goes beyond a mere obsession with supermaneuverability. The USA is now able to project force around the World, so the need for a fighter that can get somewhere at very high speed is not what it used to be. Now we need a fighter than can be invisible, be great at surveillance and jamming and if it gets into trouble must be able to completely out maneuver the enemy. So slow, smart, invisible and highly maneuverable is what we got.<p>I watched the F-22 do a Herbst maneuver today at the Seafair in Seattle which is impossible without thrust vectoring. It&#x27;s an amazing and weird sight. While the new breed of fighters have taken a lot of flak, I wouldn&#x27;t want to get into a dogfight with one of them while flying a fighter that has traditional control surfaces that need stable airflow when they&#x27;re able to fly below stall speed at crazy angles of attack and use thrust vectoring to change direction with zero airflow over their control surfaces.",1438410890
9986169,comment,9982760,9984273,0,0,dlo,,,"Statement: “... slow or fast, your body still had to break down and consume that burger.”<p>Response: You are saying that the digestion rate of the burger doesn’t matter, because the entire burger is still processed by the body. But the way your body processes the burger is different depending on the digestion rate.<p>A couple of things can happen after a given amount of glucose enters the digestive system.<p>Consider when the digestive system releases the glucose into the blood rapidly, much more rapidly than cells are able to absorb it. The pancreas releases a lot of insulin. Muscle and fat cells both significantly increase their blood glucose absorption rate.<p>Alternatively, consider when the digestive system releases the glucose into the blood gradually. Cells are able to absorb more of the blood glucose as it is coming in, so blood glucose levels do not rise as much. There is some insulin signaling, but there is less of it. High-need muscle cells already have increased their blood glucose absorption rate due to increased energy requirements, while insulin signaling to fat cells is minimized.<p>In the alternate scenario, high-need cells muscle cells, while fat cell growth is limited.<p>Statement: &quot;not eat the burger in the first place.&quot;<p>Cutting out something I like is not a sustainable way to eat healthily. Food intake is not just regulated by energy homeostasis; the reward system, e.g. the mesolimbic pathway, is also potent.<p>Statement: &quot;improve your insulin resistance/glucose tolerance&quot;<p>Agreed.<p>There are two ways to avoid excessive insulin signaling. One, you can decrease the rate at which glucose enters the blood. Two, you can increase the rate at which glucose leaves the blood.

Harlow next \n    chose to investigate if the infants had a preference for bare wire mothers or cloth \n    covered mothers. For this experiment he presented the infants with a clothed mother \n    and a wired mother under two conditions. In one situation, the wire mother held a \n    bottle with food and the cloth mother held no food. In the other situation, the \n    cloth mother held the bottle and the wire mother had nothing.[10]\n\n    Overwhelmingly, the infant macaques preferred spending their time clinging to the \n    cloth mother.[10] Even when only the wire mother could provide nourishment, the \n    monkeys visited her only to feed. Harlow concluded that there was much more to the \n    mother/infant relationship than milk and that this &quot;contact comfort&quot; was essential \n    to the psychological development and health of infant monkeys and children. It was \n    this research that gave strong, empirical support to Bowlby&#x27;s assertions on the \n    importance of love and mother/child interaction.\n</code></pre>\nAnother experiment by Harry Harlow. The interesting things to observe here is that the money felt attachment to something that provided it with contact comfort. The brain in question wouldn&#x27;t even know what &quot;contact&quot; is because it lacks a sense of touch. With that in mind (no pun intended), what we&#x27;re left to speculate is where that complex mass of neurons will venture. Will it &quot;hallucinate and invent&quot; something that provides the equivalent of a mother figure?<p>Alternatively, (and I think this is more probably), it&#x27;s possible that the brains we invent for a long time are merely equivalent to evolutionary stages of brain development from millions of years in the past. That begs the question, would the precursors of the modern human brain be considered to be an inhumane condition to the brain we have today? It clearly had a lesser capacity in all sorts of ways. The ancient human brain cannot comprehend, yet alone fathom what the modern human brain is capable of. By the time we grow these brains to the neuronal mass capable of human levels of thought, we will probably lack the ability and knowledge still on how to make it think like us because the technology for growing it bigger is going to far outstrip our capacity to coax it to grow a certain way (assuming we even know what that way we should grow it to achieve the consciousness of the modern human).",1438409926

Failing to react appropriately to the ambient chemical signals of the hive, for bees, is like being born physically deformed or mentally handicapped for humans, and the unfit would not survive in the wild. The queen&#x27;s colony must hold her aloft, as assuredly as our own legs must carry us over terrain, and our hands must pick food up and place it in our mouths.<p>This highly specific reaction to the giant wasps probably emerges the same way aversion or attraction to flavors and smells arise.

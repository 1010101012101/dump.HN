What is their goal in places where there is no more land to build on, like NY and SF, but to reconfigure it and make it more available (affordable) to more people?  Of course they seek profit and some people are substantially inconvenienced in the process, but in the broad perspective it creates value.  Whatever its flaws, Manhattan offers more to more people now than it did 100 years ago.<p>Are they not greedy, those who are renting their spots in these desirable locations and who are using the government's guns to keep others out?  As a voting constituency they're leveraging the force of government to serve their own individual interests, seemingly unconcerned about the consequences for everyone else.<p>I find it ironic that they wield the term ""greed"" with immunity.",1230703137

415186,comment,415087,415147,0,0,cgranade,,,"I really do care for the environment in its own right, and I care for a host of reasons. There's the aesthetic argument against destroying anything beautiful and the argument that more sentient species may emerge if we don't stand in their way. There's also the argument that you cannot arbitrarily distinguish between protecting the environment to better humanity and protecting it in general.<p>Frankly, I find this third argument very compelling. The environment is a highly complicated system with many chaotic behaviors that make it unreasonable to point to some aspect of the environment as being uniquely critical to human life. Some things are more critical than others, sure, but I think it's unreasonable to completely ignore any aspect of the environment on that basis.<p>As per these arguments, I would also disagree with the quoted statement. Besides, the author makes a strawman out of environmentalism. It isn't about ""self-flagellation,"" it's about engaging in a sustainable lifestyle.",1230702894

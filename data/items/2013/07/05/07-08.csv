No, you were very clearly saying:<p>>That sounds like a business idea. Create retail services in a market filled with custom dealmaking. I&#x27;m guessing that might be hard in your case since it sounds like you have to deal with huge datacenters and network providers.<p>And this is, essentially, what &quot;The cloud&quot; is, and is why &quot;the cloud&quot; is so popular.   The pricing is right on the tin, no wasted time negotiating.<p>I tried to do the same with raw rackspace and bandwidth, but really?   re-selling rackspace when you don&#x27;t own the datacenter is a really shitty business to be in.    I mean, I&#x27;m not kicking off my current customers, but depending on how the data-center that my buddy will own turns out, I may or may not actually continue to sell co-location services.<p>Also, everyone expects the negotiation.  In datacenter space and small bandwidth deals?  (at the low end, they are sold in a bundle)   there are middlemen who can funnel customers to you... for the low fee of 10% of the revenue that customer brings /for the life of the customer)     Like I said, it&#x27;s a shitty business;  if you are leasing racks and re-selling them, you are /really lucky/ to be getting 10% yourself.    (of course, margin (and labor) go up as you lease larger chunks from your provider and sell smaller chunks to your customers... margin on my quarter rack product was rather better;   rack cost $600, and if it was full I made $800.  Which isn&#x27;t bad, except that I&#x27;ve gotta fill like 10 racks just to cover getting a reasonable amount of bandwidth into the facility.)<p>Man, I&#x27;m not very coherent tonight.   But yeah, the 10% commission for the guys funneling you customers... normally?   you make up for that;  if someone comes in through one of the funnels, well, guess what, their final price after negotiation is just 10% higher than what you are willing to negotiate down to with someone who comes direct.<p>(the fucked thing here is that most of those guys that will point customers at you?   they have websites that make them look like they are co-location providers.)",1373010860

I bought a book in Arequipa or Cusco back in 2004 or so that described in detail a large amount of quipu that had been found in the area. Just reading the Wikipedia article would have been enough for this author to debunk this Incan mythical nonsense. It&#x27;s pretty widely settled now that quipu are a system for counting and bookkeeping and is not a writing system in the sense that it translates words or sounds into written equivalents. E.g. you had to know that red knots represented mules and yellow ones baskets of corn (it&#x27;s obviously much more complex than this).

I told them as much.<p>No sooner had I got off the plane and acquired some local cash than I was herded in to a long line for taxis. Walking down the demarcated isle toward the rest of the well-established queue, I mused &quot;Would you like efficiency with your totalitarianism? Apparently not!&quot; As I approached the queue, a functionary suddenly changed the demarcation belt between myself and the queue, causing me to have to walk for miles in one direction then double-back. It was so ridiculous, so Kafka, I burst out laughing.<p>Two days later at my hotel, I mentioned my eagerness to depart to an employee who was from the Philippines... his eyes darted aside, then looked me in the eyes briefly, turned around and mumbled loud enough for me to hear but nobody else &quot;I hate this place too&quot;, while pacing off down a corridor.<p>The claim to multiculturalism is laughable. Wealthy Singaporeans clearly look down on neighbouring Indonesians, Malays and Philippinos, possibly also the Indians, and are largely ethnic Chinese, often living off the profits of dynastic capital accrued running businesses in those very same neighbouring countries. I did meet some Indians who were born in Singapore - but alas - had never been to India, and appeared to be basically culturally relegated to a sort of mid level service sector niche. It seemed to me that they&#x27;d never built up the courage or economic platform to leave.<p>I even met a wealthy Chinese Singaporean who smugly quipped that his family grew rich running palm oil plantations in neighbouring Indonesia - the same sector causing the smog in Singapore - but that of course they burned theirs far away and clearly had nothing to do with the recent air quality problems!<p>Sitting in the airport departure lounge, waiting to fly out, a state-sponsored television channel blared feel-good pro-state propaganda to weary travelers. Suddenly, the national anthem came on. Interspersed with its antiquated, politically-populist, Malay-pattois verbiage (you wouldn&#x27;t catch the rich speaking the <i>common</i> language) were smoothly integrated, carefully contrived scenes of the Singaporean miracle: a multicultural table of youth happily consuming artificial foods, a laughing young man in uniform (doing his compulsory military service), and a couple of friendly, smiling police. That was just the icing on the cake.<p>Won&#x27;t be back in a hurry. Sorry, Singapore.",1373010590

I&#x27;m currently leaning towards hosting my personal mailserver at home strongly encouraging (or perhaps even enforcing) STARTTLS encrypted mail transport, running via a VPN tunnel to an internet connection at an inexpensive VPS with a non-US based provider. Since much of my mail is local (corresponding with other people inside Australia), I&#x27;m trying to decide whether an Australia based VPS perhaps under control of the local intelligence services but not requiring the bulk of my inbound (probably unencrypted) mail to hit any trans-ocean/crossing-national-boundaries backbones, would be a lower risk than a Norwgian or Icelandic based VPS which is more jurisdictionally difficult for ASIO and the NSA but which requires my inbound mail to cross those high-value-target-for-firehose-sniffing cross border backbones.<p>I&#x27;ve been raising cloud data storage legal jurisdiction based on the cloud&#x27;s physical location and the cloud company&#x27;s nationality whenever appropriate at meetings (which gets interesting responses with health/financial/childcare clients, and bored dismissiveness from just about everybody else &quot;Oh, you&#x27;re storing PII patient data?

This has made it easier to adopt docker for devops teams of ruby, python and java persuasion (among others).<p>2) the language itself is straight-forward, easy to learn and familiar to a lot of people. It&#x27;s basically a more accessible C.

Despite all the PR speech by the previous CEO, I never felt that the previous leadership really knew what the hell they were doing.<p>One of the first thing Mayer had to do was stop the culture rot within the company, and you will see that a lot of her decisions, whether its buying up other companies and making new rules around favorable working conditions, is targeted on building a strong group of core developers. This obviously takes a lot of time, there is no magic bullet to fix culture rot.<p>Mayer is from Google school of thought, so she knows a thing or two on how good working environment works. You will see that while Google has a strong leadership to guide the company, a lot of its products and services started from and driven by not the leadership, but their developers on their 20% project.<p>So to put it in short, Yahoo is not in a position like Google where they can dictate long term strategy without getting its bases in order and fix decades of rotting.<p>I think in the next 12 months or so will be interesting time to see what comes out of Yahoo.",1373009413

Use the code as a concrete, formalized model of abstract thought, don&#x27;t enslave your cognitive capacities to attempting to model the computer&#x27;s finite procedural logic.<p>Wish I had time to embark :) Maybe I&#x27;m getting there.

This amendment was made partly as a reaction to large-scale fishing expeditions carried out by the crown, trying to root out dissent. That directly parallels the govt. carrying out a large-scale fishing expedition to root out terrorism.<p>Lawyers can try to wiggle through the subjective parts in the constitution&#x27;s language, but the intent seems very clear, given the context. The founders did not want the government violating its citizens privacy except when there was a clear reason to, and then only in limited cases, or in trivial cases of privacy invasion that aren&#x27;t worth considering. Any violation of that is a violation of the spirit of the amendment, if not strictly the letter of it. The language is very forceful on this, and it&#x27;s clearly meant to be very inclusive on what is considered protected.<p>The founders didn&#x27;t have anything in their world that paralleled telephone conversations or server records, except perhaps letters, which they would consider to be effects. They also didn&#x27;t have anything to parallel our ability to pull out insights from masses of low-signal data.<p>When people talk on the phone, they have a reasonable expectation that that call is between them and the other person on the call, with AT&T acting as a dumb pipe between them, doing only as much as necessary to make that service work and count the time and rate for billing purposes. There is also the reasonable expectation that AT&T will do with that data what is necessary to bill you for it, but there is no reasonable expectation that they or the govt. will do deep analysis on it to figure out your social connections, who you like best, your travel patterns, who you might be planning something with, etc.",1373008121

Ignoring the real impact of the system as a whole is morally questionable.<p>Coming from a luckier background and accruing wealth without making efforts to alter the system is essentially tantamount to supporting systematized inequity and is therefore morally questionable.<p>Likewise, being poor in a wealthy country but consuming vast quantities of resources, whining about how the 1% is the problem whilst personally producing serious negative effects on the shared environment is also morally questionable.<p>Many philosophies (eg. Buddhism) eventually get to the point, deducing from there, where it is realized that we are all inherently destructive creatures. Our mere existence is the destruction of others&#x27; rights and resources in our vast yet finite environment. Furthermore, each of us possesses limited time and our capacity for constituting positive change is merely to correctly take charge of our own actions (including thoughts, speech, etc.) in the present.<p>I&#x27;m not sure about the monotheistic religious traditions, but in a philosophical sense Buddha&#x27;s response to this moral quandry was, IMHO, pretty well argued and pretty damn timeless!

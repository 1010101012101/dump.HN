Or at least, do not be fooled: the quiet / shy / low self-esteem types</i><p>Hmm, empirically I think this is the wrong way round. Or rather, yes, the shy girl may have emotional issues. But she is unlikely to leave you (instead become dependant). Rather it is the extrovert ones who will quickly move on to someone more interesting.<p>To be honest your mostly making a few gross generalisations based on some personal experience. I could pitch plenty of counter-examples from my own (and friends) experiences to invalidate pretty much all of it as an absolute theory :)",1272394776

She did up this spreadsheet with goal weight, predicted weight, and actual weight over the several weeks leading up to her wedding.  The three curves matched up <i>exactly</i>, down to the pound.  We were teasing her a little about just how scientific she'd made the process, and she said that it really came down to calories in - calories out.  Once you know your body's basic metabolic rate over typical exercise conditions, every X calories above that will result in gaining one pound, while every X calories below that will result in losing one pound.  The reason most diets fail isn't that the formula doesn't work, it's that most people don't have the willpower and anal-retentiveness to count calories like that.",1272394731

I was told multiple times that each state does not share data, accounting etc...  I got to this point because when I moved from one state to another I had to close out my account in one state and open in another state.  During the move I happened to accidentally double pay my final bill.<p>Now, any reasonable company would just credit me my overpayment on my new service (in the same company right?).  Nope, everyone kept telling me it was impossible.  I'd either talk to someone from my old state or my new state, but neither could see any data from the other.  After 3 months of this they mailed me a check.  Just so happens my mailman is horrible (completely different story, but this happens all time) and somehow managed to tear the numbers on the bottom of the check so I couldn't deposit it ugh.<p>Once again on the phone with comcast telling me I'd have to wait for them to cancel the check before mailing me a new one and still telling me it's impossible to credit the account.  After 10 days I called back and the CSR acted like I had never called.  So they started the process over again.  This went on for over a month.  Finally last month (nearly 7 months after the original overpayment) they CREDITED my new account!  Something I was told over and over was completely impossible across states.<p><i>EDIT</i>\nI wanted to add that actual internet and cable service from comcast has been fine, and the people on the phone were generally nice.",1272394730

Epic Systems Corp., 285 F. 3d 581, 584 (7th Cir. 2002).<p>The most Gawker revealed was (1) features readily observable on the outside and (2) information printed on the components when the device was opened. Obviously, none that would be considered a ""trade secret"" once the iPhone was up for sale on the market.<p>Can a feature list be considered a trade secretly few months before the items released? That's a tough one, particularly because Apple itself released this iPhone into the wild, where it was found by a third party. It's not like Gawker snuck into Apple's campus and found some research for products contemplated way in the future, product so far off that Apple had not yet filed a patent on the technology. (By way of background, the whole purpose of trade secret law is to protect things that a person doesn't want to disclose publicly by patenting. Almost by definition, a trade secret has to be something that was patentable, and so far nothing on the prototype iPhone looks like it was patentable.)<p>All of which brings us back to the central point: it's debatable if Apple even suffered a legally-cognizable injury by virtue of someone bringing publicity to a device Apple, through its employee, left out in the wild.

Fundamentally, what is an object? A collection of data and associated operations as an atomic unit. Typeclasses do fit that role. Another way to do ""OO"" in Haskell is:<p><pre><code>    data Animal = Animal { name :: String,\n                           is_awake :: Time -> Bool,\n                           lives_in :: Environment -> Bool }\n</code></pre>\nand so on, with the ""methods"" actually being bound at the time of creation of the Animal. See: <a href=""http://lukepalmer.wordpress.com/2010/01/24/haskell-antipattern-existential-typeclass/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lukepalmer.wordpress.com/2010/01/24/haskell-antipatte...</a><p>Other OO things could be built as well in a perfectly functional way, picking and choosing the bits of the definition of OO you want. What you can't do is choose exactly what C++ or Java gives you, and what you don't get is a Blessed Object Orientation Technique like you do with those languages. But you can program OO just as you can in C. (Only better in most ways. Note you don't get a BOOT in C either, but there are nevertheless OO C programs.)<p>Mutability is merely one dimension of OO, a term that is so flexible it basically means nothing without further qualification. OO has its place even in a functional program sometimes, as that link shows.",1272391337

Natural selection is the name of the game.<p>It baffles me that people think social development can be somehow exempted from evolutionary processes. Call it callous or compassionless, if you want, but there will always be less fit members of a species/society. Humans didn't get to this spot on the food chain by subsidizing failure. If we want to increase prosperity, we should stop encouraging the propagation of actions/ideas/genes that would otherwise be unsustainable without throwing short-sighted policy and/or tax money at it.",1272391303

61707,comment,61662,61664,0,0,Shooter,,,"For Actionscript:  Essential Actionscript 3.0 by Colin Moock is a great book.  There's also a book on Actionscript Design Patterns that is okay.  <p>For Flex: I used Total Training's DVD training and then just used Adobe's docs.  <p>Total Training also has a new online training option that is cheaper than buying the DVDs.  I'd recommend  the online library if you have a high-speed connection and don't mind NOT being able to download the vids.  (You can get online access to ALL Adobe training products for about the same as one or two Flex DVDs, roughly $200.  I just gave away and sold a bunch of access codes to the online library, and everyone reported they were thrilled with the training and service.  I've just used the DVDs.)  Send me an email if you're interested in buying any Total Training DVDs...I have a bunch of new ones still in the shrinkwrap and some that were opened and viewed once.  I'm out of the online access codes, though. ",1191267661

I'd suggest putting snapshots of the sample web sites so users get a real sense of what can be done on your site. Having the sample links as text links might not get many to click them.",1191266881
61699,comment,61639,61673,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I think this is a nameserver problem. My girlfriend's parents' computer did this, too, and there was an entry in the registry which I needed to change in order to fix it. Obviously, the problem originated from some type of malware changing the registry, but after that, it doesn't require a program to continue running. What happens is that the request for a website is sent to the malicious nameserver, which returns its own malicious IP. The address is then scanned for certain information (e.g. Google search information), and if it finds anything relevant, it redirects the user to their own ad-riddled site; otherwise, it redirects them to the originally-intended site. Obviously, this is a security issue in that all information you are transmitting is going through a malicious site. I would recommend trying to do something about this problem ASAP, even if it involves re-installing the OS.",1191266816

61697,comment,61625,61625,0,0,muerdeme,,,"Back when ""TheFacebook"" was limited to whatever universities were added that week, there was a guy at my school living on campus and pretending to be a student for at least 3 months.  He didn't get caught until one of his friends got suspicious about him using someone else's e-mail address to get a Facebook account.  The fact that he never seemed to do any actual work didn't help either.

61695,comment,61610,61610,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"He does have a point. But what still bothers me is that if even a single important part of my app does something computationally expensive (which is typically the case in my apps), I have to interface with C. Writing C code is fine, but the interfacing stuff is no pleasure at all. So I would be glad if Ruby could run, say, 50 times as fast as it does ;-)

I think it's a ""paw""? But it was not intuitive at all to me what the ""paw"" did. I kept asking myself ""how can I move this block of text?"" Only after several guesses did I figure out it was the ""paw"" icon.",1191266312

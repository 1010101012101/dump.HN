An evil genius, but a genius nonetheless.<p>This isn&#x27;t about shorting stocks. It&#x27;s about aggressive price discovery. He went up to an unreasonable price of $750 per tablet so that he can then bring the price down to the point where the public outcry stops. What&#x27;s certain is that at the end, the price will be far above where it started, and he&#x27;ll be extremely rich. He&#x27;s essentially negotiating with all of us to set a price that the market will bear and which makes us hate him and his company less. The goal is to find the absolute highest possible price for this drug. It&#x27;s not like the world stopped needing this drug when he did this - while he adjusts the price the drug is still sold far above where it used to be.<p>Lesson: It&#x27;s easy to make a billion dollars if you don&#x27;t give a shit about what the world thinks of you.<p>That said, I&#x27;m sure a lot of people could make a lot of money from this by buying shares of the company Retrophin, which he founded, and whose value dropped 10% just today. But if you&#x27;re like me you can&#x27;t in good conscience profit from his sociopathy.<p>What I worry about is other companies seeing that they can get away with this and upping their prices as well.",1442969994

There they should be sold at-cost, where &quot;cost&quot; includes licensed production as well as amortizing the cost of development for the drug (or the average total cost of the the whole pool of drugs) over say 25 years.  Apart from these issues there&#x27;s simply a lot of diseases that <1K people get worldwide, and nobody in their right mind brings those to market unless they can steal your wallet.  It&#x27;s a case of utter and total market failure in all respects.<p>The thing with marketing is that it&#x27;s a win-win for the person doing the marketing.  Direct-to-patient marketing has real-world returns (ask your doctor today if the purple pill is right for you!) and a rational player will put money into that investment until returns no longer exceed costs.  However on the whole it drives up costs for everyone since people who don&#x27;t actually need it seek treatment, and then get prescriptions.  Regardless of anything else you do, you just need to outlaw direct-to-patient marketing.  It&#x27;s a perverse incentive and we&#x27;re the only nation that allows it.",1442969916

That&#x27;s a plausible claim as that kind of thing does happen.<p>Well, if true, that strategy is clearly working.<p>Why do I say this? Because no competent lawyer would let their client post something like this. It can only hurt you. Make any statement of fact that helps the plaintiff and they&#x27;ll use it against you. Make a statement that doesn&#x27;t help them? Well they were going to dispute that anyway so who cares?<p>So I can only conclude the Shred Video doesn&#x27;t have competent legal representation and thus is probably going to be or are being bled dry by litigation unless they can find a source of funding, which, as noted, is more difficult with a lawsuit hanging over your head.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve consistently done is when I&#x27;ve left a job I&#x27;ve never taken any hardware with me nor a single line of source code. It can only hurt you. Obviously I don&#x27;t know if that were a factor here but the poster has stipulated one of the founders did have a Smule laptop with company source code on it. Woops.<p>Consider this a lesson learned: either don&#x27;t offer to help your former employer when you&#x27;re working on something else or get them to release any current or future claims to your company or IP before you do. Also, you probably want to get paid upfront. A separate contract should govern such work and it should state clearly that the former employee has access to the source code at the employer&#x27;s request and the employer relinquishes any claims resulting from that source code. Employer might not go for that. Fine. Walk away.<p>As Paul Sutter stated, this is an emotional appeal. I too suspect there was fault on both sides here without knowing the facts.<p>One question I have is: when did the founders start working on what became their startup? That matters. If there&#x27;s a crossover with their employment then that&#x27;s potentially a problem.<p>In California the law is pretty generous with side projects so this might actually be OK but here&#x27;s the thing...<p>If the plaintiff through discovery finds source code commits to the project that occurred before they finished working for Smule then even with Californian law they have a problem because the plaintiff has now established:<p>1. The founders started working on this before terminating employment; and<p>2. They claimed otherwise.<p>It&#x27;s (2) that gets you into trouble because it hurts your credibility when making any other claims.<p>This is why any competent lawyer will not allow you to make such public statements. Let me repeat: it can only hurt you.<p>The founders are making the mistake of trying to win this in the court of public opinion. That doesn&#x27;t matter for this particular plaintiff I suspect. So they&#x27;ve just given him a bunch of ammunition as every statement will be carefully parsed and fact-checked and any inconsistency will be used against them. Even if a statement is ambiguous and was intended one way but can be interpreted another (that can be disproven), it&#x27;s a problem.<p>I had a threat of a lawsuit once that basically amounted to someone using the threat of it to get out of paying a fairly substantial amount of money. Not life-changing but certainly annoying.

Until then don&#x27;t give them any ammunition.<p>Other facts that may matter here are any patents Smule has or are pending and if the founders are listed as inventors.

But the reality is a bit more complex than it might look.<p>Many people I know haven&#x27;t been aware that Linux has had in-built dynamic tracing capabilities for years, with ftrace, kprobes and later uprobes. These are much more difficult to use (which is why I wrote some front-ends: <a href=""https://github.com/brendangregg/perf-tools"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/brendangregg/perf-tools</a>). But if you really cared about performance, you could use them. So it&#x27;s not that Linux has been completely missing out; It&#x27;s been missing out on a some specific features (eg, in-kernel aggregations and variables), and a nice interface.<p>As for attempts unabated to reinvent DTrace: FWIW, that&#x27;s not really the genesis in the case of bcc/eBPF. Extended Berkeley Packet Filtering (eBPF) was developed to create virtual network infrastructures. Things like this: <a href=""https://www.iovisor.org/sites/cpstandard/files/pages/images/building_virtual_network_infrastructure_with_io_visor.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.iovisor.org/sites/cpstandard/files/pages/images/...</a> . It provides a kernel virtual machine for executing sandboxed bytecode. As a bonus, it can be used for system tracing as well, to do custom capabilities that ftrace/perf_events was missing.<p>There are too many tracers for Linux already, so I&#x27;m pretty glad that eBPF is getting integrated into the Linux kernel, since it should stop discourage anyone inventing yet-another-linux-tracer, since the kernel will already have a powerful tracer in-built. We&#x27;ll no longer need new tracers. We&#x27;ll want front-ends, like bcc.",1442968872

Test it. Of course, CF has other benefits too, it&#x27;s not just about the page speed.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I&#x27;m not claiming anything here. It&#x27;s just a quick rant and a screenshot. Don&#x27;t take it too seriously.<p>Other than that, it is becoming somewhat concerning just how much traffic goes through CloudFlare. Nothing against you CF guys. Just good ol&#x27; paranoia :)<p>EDIT:\nFor most places CloudFlare does a great, well, amazing job and keeps the page speed down to <1s, often <500ms. But again, it really depends where your visitor are.

Reasonable people can disagree about whether the benefits outweigh the costs, but we should talk more openly about the downsides instead of reflexively treating privacy as sacrosanct.<p>The value that we know as &quot;privacy&quot; is far more arbitrary and historically contingent than most of us realize. In societies where resource scarcity forces people to share bedrooms, the acceptable spheres of privacy are radically different from the ones that modern American life inculcates.<p>Are other social boundaries equally flexible? And if so, should we test them?<p>Perhaps so. There is an intrinsic tension between the pursuit of privacy and the hacker ethos that information wants to be free. By definition, privacy is an act of sacrifice: a denial of information to other nodes in the network that forms civilization. Our laws already recognize narrow circumstances in which the costs of that sacrifice outweigh the benefits, such as when there is probable cause to believe that an individual is abusing his or her right to privacy in order to undertake criminal activity.<p>Yet there is a social taboo attached to radical opposition to privacy. For example, an integrated network of ubiquitous surveillance could offer incredible benefits to humanity. Violent crime could be virtually eradicated. People could be held accountable for anti-social behaviors, like littering or cutting off other drivers. Our entire society could operate more efficiently in innumerable ways. But open advocacy of a surveillance state is only a few degrees away from fascism according to our modern political mores.<p>In the example from the story, it&#x27;s clear that our collective welfare could be increased by analyzing reams of restricted data. Are we willing to intentionally tolerate greater human suffering in order to preserve the amorphous right to privacy?<p>I contend that it&#x27;s more useful to look at the discrete harms that flow from disclosure of specific information. How could people be harmed? What kinds of safeguards could be put in place to prevent that concrete harm?<p>Those are useful questions, which allow us to make informed choices instead of switching off our brains and discussing &quot;privacy&quot; in the abstract.",1442966558

It gave me the ability to converse with people that were similarly interested in inventing and opened my eyes up to a whole host of interesting solutions to large and small problems alike.<p>I think what I&#x27;ll miss most about it was scrolling through the list of inventions and marveling at the incredible amount of variance between seemingly good ideas, and the heaping mass of ridiculous ideas. Even though I loved picking apart ideas that I thought were completely implausible, the very fact that people were putting the time into designing and fighting for their inventions was something I loved. I honestly didn&#x27;t follow the company during the last few years, and I can&#x27;t  say I&#x27;m completely surprised that they reached this point, but it will always have a special place in my heart for enabling the creative side of many people.",1442966533

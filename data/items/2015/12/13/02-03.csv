Meyers books, Sutter books, GotW, &quot;Modern C++&quot;, etc.  Then, when C++11 came out, the language became even more complicated, not less.

Such a thing is no big deal in a language like Javascript, but for a language like Go that aims to be fastish, it&#x27;s probably a non-starter.<p>Finding a compiler that monomorphizes generics and is also as fast as Go is probably a much harder challenge. I&#x27;ve had some folks claim that one of D&#x27;s compilers is pretty fast, but I haven&#x27;t seen any good benchmarks to support that claim.

If we had built our cities, our towns, our power plants, and ports during a climactic equivalent to the last ice-age, we would be absolutely fucked if the climate shifted in a short period of time to where it is now. During the last ice age there was a land mass which linked Britain to Norway, Denmark, France and the Netherlands, and sea levels were 100m lower than they are today. The northern ice cap covered everything north of London, and the Sahara was fertile.

The industrial revolution&#x27;s timing of shift work placed a very long-lasting and extremely strong weight on punctuality. And that punctuality often run 24/7, meaning that the clock&#x27;s crucial tipping points often landed at unpleasant hours like 7am (be <i>at</i> your station at 7am, which means getting there between 6:30am and 6:45am, which means leaving the house by 6am, which means waking by 5am...)<p>Add that a lot of people who work physically hard in that sort of tiring shift work (especially people my parent&#x27;s age) learn to consider early rising a moral virtue and a badge of worth, and you&#x27;ve got a lot of pressure to hold it up as an admirable standard. It can get pretty silly, to the point that I&#x27;ve seen people promoted for punctuality despite a record of poor performance; factories <i>are</i> different, of course, but America was built on the power of heavy industry, so it&#x27;s a philosophy that pervades. To wit: even in fields where work spans months instead of hours, getting up daily &#x27;before your competitors&#x27; gives you an &#x27;edge&#x27;. It&#x27;s a really odd notion if you look at it closely.<p>On the other hand, I find the added mild stress of waking early, combined with a ritual (absolutely and especially like making coffee as noted in the article) helps me have an excellent start to the day. I <i>don&#x27;t</i> usually do that, but I really like it when I do.<p>Waking early is nice, so long as I&#x27;m not horribly sleep deprived to start; or so stressed that I can&#x27;t fall asleep early.<p>EDIT: I should note that I&#x27;m just skimming the surface here.

Why not leave everything as it was for current customers and just limit new ones. They&#x27;ve done it before when they had skydrive/windows live mesh/windows live folders/office live workspaces which each offered an independant amount of free data (usually somewhere between 5-25gb) when they eventually consolidated them all anyone who had previously used the services got 25gb while OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) offered 15gb.<p>And in general grandfathered deals aren&#x27;t unprecedented, nearly every credit card/cell phone plan/[any service with long term agreements] that changes lets people who had the original keep what they had and just changes things for new customers.",1449972054

Saying for any individual consumer, paying an extra 5% for their maple syrup on average is a drop in the bucket, so if sales are $1 billion USD, we&#x27;re basically letting the farmers extract $50 million from consumers, and that&#x27;s not too much money, so who cares?<p>Well, I think $50 million is a lot of money, but that is seriously neglecting the other, bigger cost: the blocking of incentives to maximize production quantity and develop innovations.<p>If the cartel were dismantled, it&#x27;s not just that prices would fall for existing consumers, but total supply curve would increase as well, since farmers would each have the incentive to produce as much as possible. Maybe it would turn from a $1 billion market to a $1.25 billion market. Whatever the particular number, it&#x27;s bound to be a huge amount of value destroyed.<p>But the most violent sort destruction is that production quotas kill the incentive to innovate. Look at publications like this - there is very little incentive to experiment with new techniques like this in Quebec, because even if you could double your production, you wouldn&#x27;t be allowed to sell anything past your quota. <a href=""http://modernfarmer.com/2014/01/maple-syrup-revolution/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://modernfarmer.com/2014/01/maple-syrup-revolution/</a>  Destroying the incentive to innovate is murdering the future.",1449972032

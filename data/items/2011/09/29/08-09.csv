Of the two cost calculators I referenced, one identifies Houston groceries as costing 45% less than Manhattan, and the other has a long list of representative food prices, many of which are around twice as much in NYC. This roughly matches my personal experience comparing Bay Area grocery prices to those in the Austin, TX region.<p>Same goes for cars  though less so for new cars, even there, when you check prices at a site like Edmunds, there are regional adjustments. For used cars, the same model/year/mileage combinations go for much less in Texas than California. And that's before transfer taxes and registration.",1317286702

3051611,comment,3051029,3051029,20,0,jorangreef,,,"I have been writing Node since late 2009 and Javascript with Rhino before that and Javascript with Rails before that. Before Node, I was used to linear program execution and was hesitant to switch to writing asynchronous code.<p>My mental model of code was one-dimensional: do this, then do that, then do that. So I was used to exception handling for errors, and my programs were like trains on a track. This was a comfortable abstraction, but the way in which my programs were written did not reflect what they were doing in the real-world: reading from disk, reading from the network, waiting for something, doing something, responding to something, receiving something in chunks.<p>Now, looking back, I prefer writing code that reflects what my programs are doing. There is more headspace, another dimension, no longer one thing after another, but a stack of things hovering and happening at the same time, interacting with each other, moving forwards through time.<p>Now, instead of trying to make concurrent work appear non-concurrent, I prefer to embrace concurrency and see how I can write for concurrency. This is almost certainly different to the way in which I would have written synchronous code. Code for me is less complex now and shorter now than when it was synchronous. It feels richer and more descriptive of the work being performed. It's also faster and more reliable. In essence, I have learned to write better concurrent code.",1317284690

Has that changed? Possibly, but until we see the next crop of webapps we may not know. Personally, I feel that there is a certain irrational preference for having an app installed on your device, where it won't change or update automatically and will be accessible offline (even if you can't do anything useful with it).<p>Having said that, web apps have expanded and done quite well in the PC world - the idea of a native Facebook desktop client is laughable, and I'd guess that most average users use a web app for email.<p>It'll be interesting to see how this battle goes.",1317284264

Take into account though that for many people most of their gym time is overhead, especially if they don't have equipment at home. A large % of time is taken up by getting to and from the gym, getting changed, taking a shower, setting up the right weights on the bar and doing warm-ups, cool-downs & stretching. Because of this, adding an extra set doesn't mean that you'll take 2-3 times as long in total.\nDetermining whether the faster gains you get from doing the additional sets are worth the marginal time depends on a number of factors. If you have plenty of time available for workouts, then do the 2-3 sets and reach your goals faster, if your time is extremely constrained, then the extra 20 minutes per workout might not be worth it",1317283273

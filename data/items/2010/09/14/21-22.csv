1692496,comment,1690580,1690703,0,0,dkarl,,,"That comment was about the NoSQL community's hostile reaction to his criticisms of MapReduce, and it does indeed show that they're not interested in knowing about databases, because they read his criticism in the context of an imaginary (or only-real-because-people-think-it's-real) SQL vs. NoSQL struggle.  Instead of seeing it as an analysis of the shortcomings of MapReduce (and being curious about the perspective or needs that might make those shortcomings important,) their simplistic reaction was that he was fighting for the wrong side and needed to be discredited.<p>One of the comments on the blog exemplifies the reaction perfectly:<p><i>Technically, I agree with much of this article</i> ... <snip> ...  <i>But none of that matters. It’s all about hearts and minds, and if the DB industry adopts the attitude in this article, it’s back to what I said at HPTS back in 2001: We Lose.</i><p>Screw content, screw technical judgment, it's about attitude and ""winning"" the struggle ""against"" existing database technologies.",1284501564

A more precise estimate of the angle is 90 * atan2(sqrt(76 * 76 - 25 * 25), 76) / atan2(1, 0).<p>Key assumptions are that there is no wind, the speed of the plane is a constant 500 mph, the speed of sound is constant at 760 mph (actually untrue in real life, see <a href=""http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/elevation-speed-sound-air-d_1534.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/elevation-speed-sound-air-...</a>), the airplane is maintaining a constant elevation, and the curvature of the Earth is irrelevant.<p>In that situation the actual elevation of the plane doesn't matter.  Look at the triangle formed from where the airplane let out the sound, where the observer is, and where the airplane now is.  If you double the height of the airplane then that becomes a similar triangle with all lengths doubled.  So we may as well assume that the sound traveled for 6 minutes, so the plane has moved 50 miles and the sound moved 76.<p>It is easy to verify that at any point in time the rate at which the airplane is adding to the angle between where it was and where it will be depends on how close it is to you (the closer the better).  From this it is easy to show that the maximum has to happen with the original position of the plane, the observer, and the current position forming an isosceles triangle.  And that happens when the observer, the half-way point for the plane, and the current position form a right-angled triangle with opposite 25 miles and hypotenuse 76 miles.  So the adjacent is sqrt(76^2 - 25^2).<p>The rest falls out of the definition of atan2.  (Assuming no careless errors.)",1284500510

Google would be one example of a company that, for all its many missteps and concerning moves, is broadly speaking fighting for a more open net rather than a more closed net. (I'm not saying they've been 100% successful or 100% aligned to openness, but net-net I've been reasonably impressed with their vision on this point; and again, by ""reasonably impressed"" I do not mean ""in love with"".)

The reason we didn't pursue anything like this is because sites are easily capable of doing it themselves in their own UI - the URL bar itself needs to come with expected behaviors, and when sites are able to overload it, it becomes more unpredictable. Standardized web UI has been a dream for many years, but the chaotic cacophony of the web is where all the beauty and innovation lies. Though it's a long way from the old ideals of User Agents, a modern browser's job is to get out of the way.<p>2. Windows Explorer is also able to get away with this style of UI because most people rarely type anything in that field; in the case of the browser, people are typing things in there all the time. Conflating menu-based and text-based navigation is hard.<p>3. Even though people are generally familiar with the structure of their own filesystem, navigating through it using the breadcrumb-menu interface is somewhat foreign - people don't like to think about sibling pages, especially for pages elsewhere in the stack. This becomes worse when you're dealing with random websites, where you don't know the layout of each.<p>4. Many websites don't map to a standardized navigation - products can exist in multiple categories, and sites like Wikipedia completely mess with the notion of tree-based structures. Building a notion of site structure into the browser was too prescriptive (see rant at end of point 1).",1284498534

You also get to work with plenty of people smarter and/or more experienced, which is a great way to grow professionally.<p>Starting your own company (or joining a very early stage startup) means you'll be spending only a small proportion of your time coding: if all you do is as a founder is write code, you're essentially guaranteed to fail. Certain kinds of problems (core web search algorithms in post-Google era being the obvious one) are also, traditionally, are much more difficult for small startups to tackle than they are for big companies: certainly if you're passionate about these kinds of problems, than startups are generally off the table (in this case, your opportunity cost is much higher than money).<p>Obviously, it's still extremely rewarding for many people (it's something I'm still interested in doing at one point or another), but ""start my own company"" vs. ""work at a great technology company"" is neither clear cut in favour of the former nor mutually exclusive (witness ""Xoogler"" startups, Paypal Mafia, etc...)",1284498270

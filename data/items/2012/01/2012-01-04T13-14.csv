it is specialized for discovering places and know where your friends are.<p>foursquare is not a feature, it is an experience. Foursquare is for checkins like instagram is for photos or Google maps for maps. Since facebook has photo sharing,it does not mean instagram is in trouble. 
when you are really good at what you do, it does not matter. 
Foursquare really matters for cities. in 5 years from now, almost everyone will have a smartphone and people will(already are) start adding more useful digital information to real world places. These informations are going to be their assest. in longterm,foursquare is going to be huge if they execute in the right way.",1325685567

They get to tell the world about their superior system of government where citizens have a say in how their government runs (sometimes they even invade others to impose this ""superior"" system on them). And that's great. But then there is the other side of the coin when the said govt. screws up, then citizens should man up and take responsibility. I am responsible for US invading Iraq and Afghanistan. If I am in those countries and I would be afraid for my safety (and rightly so). I didn't vote for it,  and I don't think realistically people have the power and the voice in most advertised democracies. But then, one can argue, they are also responsible for now changing the system (and therefor the 99% Occupy stuff is happening all over, it is not about economy it is about who has the power, control and responsability).",1325685482

My story is, that for my kid, I bought a $5,000 violin from a dealer after doing blind testing among a range of violins with ourselves and my kid's high-powered teachers. Everybody agreed that this was a great sounding violin.  A couple years later, I wanted a cheap violin for myself so I bought a $200 violin on eBay.  It arrived with a fallen soundpost so I needed to take it to the violin store for them to reset it for $15, plus, I put new strings on it for $40.  I ended up selling that one and buying another $200 violin, which needed a new bridge, which costs about $75 at the local violin shop.  I didn't want to spend so much money for each of the violins I was trying, so instead of getting it fixed at the shop, I ended up learning how to shape a new bridge myself, to save money.  What followed was a couple year period where I bought and sold about two dozen $200 violins.  I would buy them on eBay, fix them up into playable condition, and resell them from my home via Craigslist.<p>So, the buyers would come with their own current violins and I would put my eBay specials AND my kid's $5,000 into the mix for the blind sound tests.  The $5,000 violin was always one of the leaders but not always the winner.<p>Eventually I settled on a single violin that I liked the best to keep for my own.  I took it to the violin shop where people had much more skill than me and spent about $600 to get a nicer bridge, soundpost, and for some repair work that I didn't have the skills to tackle.  So, yes, I got a great sounding violin for $200, a couple years of trial and error learning, and then another $600 for rehab.",1325685194

I'd go as far as to say it might be frustrating because the idea is awesome but they won't be able to really achieve stuff in this context. Still a great initiative!<p>I wish that, starting with high school, most teaching was project-based and schools worked to enable students to discover and learn stuff they care about, rather than shoving knowledge down one's throat. Want to make video games? Learn woodwork? Build an electronic device? Learn cooking? Schools should strive to provide a framework to make those things happen!<p>I think teaching people to be passive and keeping them from being productive until their twenties is a huge factor in school failure, dropping out and lots of social issues (at least in France where I'm from).",1325684313

Even if their security model is better than what Dropbox is now using, you have to factor in availability issues (Dropbox seems more solid as a business than a lot of the others), functionality, etc.  You also need to trust the entire development process, release engineering, and knowing your binaries correspond to the source code.  It's not easy.<p>There is a slight benefit to ""must ship trojaned software to recover passphase, then decrypt"" vs. ""just access data server-side"", but in practice, if your threat is the government, there's not a huge difference.  If your threat is a server break-in by a third party, then there's some difference.<p>Overall, probably the best bet, if you don't run your own servers, is Dropbox plus your choice of well tested encryption on top.  As for your best well-tested encryption, that's a hard problem too -- Truecrypt has a pretty wide following and some versions have been audited, and source is published.  For general purpose use on Macs, I just use Apple's encryption -- it's probably ok, but as far as I know, hasn't really been analyzed by third parties (I'd be happy to NDA and look at it).  I rationalize it as if Apple is subverted, and I use OSX, I'm fucked even if third party disk encryption software itself is safe.",1325683844

Their social features are only good if you have friends on the service, that are active, AND live in the same area.  Their explore, radar, and lists features are awesome, but they came a bit too late and their website is only now catching up to the mobile experience.

3423928,story,,,1,1,bromley,"Show HN: Degree Days API for Bulk Analysis of Heating/Cooling Energy-Usage Data",,"I'm in two minds about posting this as it's a rather niche product.  But here goes anyway:<p>http://www.degreedays.net/api/<p>Degree days are a specialist form of temperature data that comes in three main flavours: heating degree days (HDD), cooling degree days (CDD), and growing degree days (GDD).  Respectively they correlate with heating energy consumption (e.g. the energy required to heat a building), cooling energy consumption, and plant growth.  People use the data to monitor energy consumption for ongoing efficiency and to normalize it for the weather so that they can more accurately track their progress towards energy/carbon reduction targets.<p>The degreedays.net system turns raw temperature data into degree days.  The raw temperature data comes from Weather Underground, to whom I am eternally grateful for letting the project go ahead (and for their awesomely huge database of weather data).  The aim is to take something complicated and messy (raw temperature data is frequently irregular, patchy, and erroneous in parts) and turn it into continuous sets of degree-day data that are error-checked and easy to work with.<p>The main site - http://www.degreedays.net/ - was launched in 2008, and now has between 500 and 1000 people downloading data from it each day.  Most of the regular users are energy-saving pros of various sorts, like consultants that advise businesses on how to save energy, and energy managers at large organizations.  (Typically the bigger the energy spend of the organization, the more to be gained from this sort of analysis.)<p>What's new is the API at http://www.degreedays.net/api/  For that we've had to beef up the data-calculation infrastructure, switching from a VPS to an Amazon EC2 cluster running on Elastic Beanstalk, with temperature data stored in SimpleDB.<p>Right now you can only use the API with the client libraries for Java (or other JVM languages) and .NET.  There's an XML API underneath but it still needs to be documented.  Also, whilst the Java and .NET client libraries are really easy to work with, the XML API underneath is not so straightforward...  The typical use case is to use the API to generate large quantities of custom-specified data, fast, and that just didn't seem to fit with a simple REST approach.  Instead we have an XML-RPC API that breaks more ""best practices"" than you could shake a stick at.  Though it does work well.<p>Java and .NET seems to suit most of the companies that we've spoken to about this so far, but we do need to support other options.  I'm contemplating trying my hand at a Python client library as well as documenting the underlying XML API.<p>I spent many months agonizing over the design of the API, particularly that of the Java and .NET client libraries.  I'm ashamed to say that I am a hopeless perfectionist, and about as slow a developer as they come.  We've got companies integrating this API into installable software (energy-tracking and energy-reporting packages for businesses), so long-term compatibility is a top priority.  I'm hopeful that the time spent on the technical design will pay off if it means we can keep the API usable and approachable whilst retaining backwards compatibility.<p>Feedback and questions are most welcome if you should have any.<p>I'm guessing it's unlikely that many readers are working on the sorts of energy/HVAC/utilities software that this API would be useful to, so apologies if you think this post off topic.  But if you are working in a similar space and would like to get in contact, I'd love to hear from you.  Send an email through the site with my name in it and it'll get to me.",1325682153

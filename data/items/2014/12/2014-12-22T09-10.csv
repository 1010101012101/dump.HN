Also, the price of housing is highly likely to only crash to the cost of building a new house - wear and tear + scarcity costs for land.<p>There is a speculative component in house prices, and this is a concern for anyone who is &quot;storing value&quot; in them, but there are fundamental uses for housing far beyond the fundamental uses for gold.<p>Equities have a value story too. The dividend on stocks represents a future earnings value which is tradable. Also Equities provide voting rights which have value.<p>Fiat currency has a value story; the states monopoly of violence provides it with the ability to collect tax from economic activity where that monopoly holds true.

A small part of that is the cost of interviewing, or more generally, selecting candidates.<p>Does any company out there test a new-hire candidate by offering to pay them a fixed amount to contribute to an open source project, and write about the contributions as they are done and when they complete them?<p>I haven&#x27;t heard of this, but I would love to do it. I am thinking you would ask for 1 week of well paid work as an interview process. That&#x27;s barely enough time to gain some traction, so in reality a dedicated candidate would spend much more time, effectively setting their own rate.<p>Then the company looks at what got done over the pay and the time. From that you calculate the salary and equity split.<p>The initial &quot;interview&quot; period, would often cover a longer period of time, based on both parties agreement.<p>What ground rules, if any, would you set? How much would you offer to pay?<p>It&#x27;s fully tax deductible. It buys a lot of positive externality and even direct benefit in the form of evaluating a hire. This would be done near the final stage of the process.<p>As a percentage of the total time and costs it takes to make a major hire, an &quot;interview&quot; like this would be a minor component.

Even people who were in secure industries were at risk because of the deflation in salaries. IT/Operations was reasonably safe.<p>> How were your wages affected?<p>Roughly cut in half overall. Through the worst of it in two years then back to normal.<p>> Well-insulated if/when the next crash happens?<p>Aside from a good savings account. Don&#x27;t be afraid to pick up a little ops experience. Most people I knew who sailed through the bubble spent a few years doing in-house work for some non-tech company.

8782545,comment,8780945,8782122,0,0,ZenoArrow,,,"&quot;It was a sexist statement.&quot; in your opinion. In my opinion it was not. Effective verbal communication requires more than just a speaker that thoughtfully chooses their words, it also requires listeners that can interpret in a flexible way. One way to do this is to be able to consider different levels of meaning. Take the word &#x27;male&#x27; out of the statement we&#x27;re discussing... now, what point do you think the author is trying to make?<p>&quot;There is no evidence that preferred entertainment becomes reality.&quot; Have you never heard of &#x27;life imitating art&#x27;? VR is probably a good example, there are a number of high profile people in the VR field who cite specific works of cyberpunk fiction as a strong early influence. I can name them if you&#x27;d like? It&#x27;d also be possible to illuminate the influence that Star Trek has had on our technology. What I find is that most people consume fiction about the future as entertainment, but later when certain aspects of it become possible they&#x27;re welcomed as &#x27;the future&#x27; because that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve been led to expect from the future. For example, try to imagine a future where we give up on high tech and figure out another path to take... see that idea in much of our media? No, it&#x27;s clear we expect much more tech in our future (as long as society doesn&#x27;t collapse). That singlemindedness came out of somewhere.<p>&quot;what exactly does diversity have to do with scientific reality?&quot; Science does not exist in a vacuum, it is interwoven into the world in which we live. Putting aside the main corrupting influences placed upon science itself (money and ego), so that we can assume scientific research is a pure field, there are frequently new ethical questions surrounding the direction that scientific research follows. It is important that scientific research is sensitive to the culture in which it inhabits. Having a diversity of opinion guiding science helps strengthen the outcome. If you believe science should not be restrained by societal concerns then I can share some ideas that may give cause to reconsider.",1419240808

I got laid off, was lucky enough to find another job at 80k, and then was laid off again ten days before 9/11.  The recruiters I was working with all slowly became unemployed.  Once I had an opportunity to interview from a recruiter on behalf of one of either Intel or Nike, and the rate they quoted me (for perl/php programming) was $12/hour.  (I declined the interview.)<p>After a couple of months, I started cold-calling businesses as a consultant/freelancer - got my first gig at $20/hour, and then a more reasonable one at $55/hour, since then I&#x27;ve been passed around via word of mouth.  I found that clients were more amenable to contracts than FTE because they all needed work &quot;for now&quot; but were petrified of commitment since they had no idea what the future would be like.  Anyway, I stuck with freelancing and have never since taken a salaried job.<p>Basic advice - don&#x27;t sacrifice your salary for stock options (unless you&#x27;re a founder and already have enough emergency fund saved up to last you through another crash).  Don&#x27;t trust your &quot;like a family&quot; employer to take care of you, don&#x27;t believe that HR has your best interests at heart.  You&#x27;re in business for you, not your employer - treat them well in exchange for them treating you fairly, but not out of some misplaced sense of &quot;loyalty&quot;.

It reminds me of the way 2D platformers were mined, explored, and iterated upon starting around 7 or 8 years ago.<p>Right now, it doesn&#x27;t take much to stand out from the herd, as many of the most popular games in the genre don&#x27;t do much beyond generating a bunch of square rooms and connecting them with doors and short, straight corridors. In my opinion, developers in the genre should take more cues from Doom, and less from original Zelda dungeons moving forward.<p>And, from a more holistic perspective, nobody <i>really</i> cares about mazes, room placement on a grid, and connective corridors when playing a game, beyond a brute mechanical level. A more useful framework for thinking of generating levels might be to go one level of abstraction higher. Think about a level as a story for your player, and generate setpieces or &#x27;acts&#x27; that you want the player to experience as they play. Keep in mind the basics of a good story: an escalation in tension and difficulty, spaced with breathers for rhythm and flow. Place those sets on a path in a map, then figure out a way to connect them together at the lower level with rooms, objects, enemies, and corridors.",1419240282

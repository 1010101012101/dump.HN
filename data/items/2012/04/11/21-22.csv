But you point out ""music theory isn't much rooted in math."" I think the sentiment is true, music theory is generally taught and practiced without much thought to mathematics.<p>However, the fundamental concepts music theory are based on are all analogous to mathematical statements. You can see what I'm talking about here.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_and_mathematics#Frequency_and_harmony"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_and_mathematics#Frequency...</a><p>You'll notice that a fundamental frequency is picked, and we give names to several related frequencies (octave, third, fifth etc). All of these labels are analogous to various multiplications of the fundamental frequency. We learn to recognize some of the simpler relationships, as they are easily identifiable (different chords are an example of this).<p>Any one who can count can recognize a number on the number line and compare it to another number and tell if it's smaller or larger. Those who have begin to understand arithmetic can identify the difference between those numbers, and if they are multiples of each other. Advanced mathematicians can tell us about more complicated relationships.<p>In music we have tones that can be ordered, and musicians learn through experience to make these same judgments about tones without even knowing it. Any amateur musician can hear a pair of tones side by side and recognize which is higher or lower in pitch. The more advanced ear can identify notes that are the same or they can tell you a harmonic relationship between them. This is a different way of experiencing mathematical relationships within an ordered set.<p>At it's core, I think music theory is absolutely the study of finding which combinations of tones create the numerical relationships we find most appealing in sound.",1334181455

3829860,comment,3828926,3829414,1,0,mattacurtis,,,"Here is better phrasing or a good way to think about hypothesis testing:<p>""The goal of the test is to determine if the null hypothesis can be rejected. A statistical test can either reject (prove false) or fail to reject (fail to prove false) a null hypothesis, but never prove it true (i.e., failing to reject a null hypothesis does not prove it true)."" (Wikipedia)<p>I might also change some of the wording of these:<p>""The Null Hypothesis states that if you dont change anything than nothing will be different.""<p>The null hypothesis states that there are no differences in X (where X is the metric you are using to evaluate the performance of the different experiences, or recipes. X could be things like Conversion Rate, Click Rate, Time on Page, Revenue per Visitor etc) between the control experience and any number of test experiences.<p>""If you divide your traffic and see significant differences in your metrics you have failed the Null hypothesis.""<p>I would just say ""...you would reject the null hypothesis."" In this case, you're basically saying that there is evidence to suggest that the differences in X (where X is the variable you're measuring) are not due to chance / noise / natural variation alone. By saying ""you would reject the null hypothesis"", the implication is that you would accept the alternative hypothesis. Remember, the null is that there are no differences in X and the alternative is that there are differences in X (where X is your success metric).<p>""Failing the Null hypothesis means that either you have not collected enough results to even out the noise or there is something wrong with the algorithm that you are using to segment your traffic.""<p>By ""Failing the Null hypothesis,"" do you mean ""rejecting it"" or ""failing to reject it?""<p>If you mean ""rejecting it"", I'm not sure how to read what you wrote.<p>If you mean ""failing to reject it,"" you're basically saying here that if you don't reject the null hypothesis, it is  due to one of 3 things (or a combination of the 3):<p>1) Your sample size is not large enough<p>This is a tricky boat to get into. Any difference in the metric your are testing for will reach statistical significance with a large enough sample size. If you're interested more in this, go look at the math formulas.<p>You should decide ahead of time how long you want to run a test for, knowing how much traffic the page you're testing will receive, and how many experiences / groups / segments you are splitting this traffic into.<p>If you don't reach significance, it could just be that the differences you were testing for are too small.<p>Knowing the standard deviation / variance in the metric you're testing can help you understand which one of the above it is (sample size is too small or differences you are tested are too small)<p>2) You don't have enough evidence to suggest that any differences you see are due to anything other than variation / chance / noise.<p>This can happen a lot when the changes / differences you're testing are too small.<p>3) You have a Type II error<p>You have failed to reject a false null hypothesis. The test should have told you there was a difference, but for whatever reason, the sample data you saw did not provide you with evidence to do so.",1334181411

3829855,comment,3828330,3829625,4,0,carterschonwald,,,"Actually, the question then becomes one of trading off sharing vs cache locality. To whit, for many functional languages, memory allocation is essentially just a pointer increment, so there is no a prior reason to not assume that a freshly allocated tree occupies a contiguous region of memory, or at least contiguoudly on each page where it's been allocated.<p>Claims about data structures in the context of how they're allocated in a modern machine architecture / memory model are not the same thing as claims regarding the semantics that are exposed to the user of a programming language.<p>I think you do raise an interesting question, namely what's the layout in memory of a tree like data structure in eg scheme or Haskell, when the tree is built from scratch, but also when updated and a garbage collection run has compacted the data.  Oooo, I totally want to investigate this now! (I don't have the time to, but I totally want to.)<p>Point being, depending on the memory management semantics for heap data in a programming language, any claims about locslity happening for tree data may or may not happen.<p>This actually raises a really beautiful question: what is the complextity of any garbage collection algorithm that exactly or approximately maximizes the locality of tree or directed graph like data structures in memory? I want to speculate that perhaps the data structures which people find fast in practice are actually in some sense enabling the gc to preserve locality.  I wonder how optimally the layout can be when only linear or nearly linear time algorithms are considered!",1334181298

3829805,comment,3828330,3829625,3,0,eru,,,"> As for how it affects the question of imperative vs. functional data structure performance, it should tend to favor the imperative ones. The issue is that purely functional data structures aren't allowed to just grab a block of memory all at once and insert data into it at leisure. (That would be a form of mutation.) Instead space has to be allocated as it is needed, in a piecemeal fashion. As a result, longer-lived and more active purely functional data structures will tend to scatter across the heap over time.<p>It's a bit more complicated than that.  To talk about runtime (and memory) of an algorithm or a data structure, you need to have a machine model.  If you look at what happens in, say, Haskell: We write our algorithms in a purely functional way, but we are interested in their runtime after compilation into native code.  The compiler is free to do any transformation that preserves correctness, so if it's smart enough, it might grab a block of memory all at once.  Or if it can prove that data won't be used again, it can safely change variables in place.  (The language Clean even has type system support for that kind of mutation.  (See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_type_system)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_type_system)</a>)<p>You might be able to analyse functional algorithms with a machine model that doesn't involve compilation to some form of imperative code.  Perhaps by counting reductions in lambda calculus.  But then it's hard to compare that to asymptotic performance of imperative algorithms.",1334180492

3829801,comment,3828330,3829374,0,0,cube13,,,">I predicated my assertion on bounded memory, hence n is constant. Therefore O(log n) means that the operation is bounded in time by k log n. But since n is also a constant, this is equal to some other constant k'. This is equivalent to saying that the operation is bounded by O(1).<p>You're fundamentally misunderstanding what big-O notation means.  You cannot say that since n has an upper limit, everything is constant.  By your argument, the actual speed of an algorithm doesn't matter, period, since the sample size is bounded, which means that everything evaluates to a constant.<p>That's wrong.<p>Big-O notation is used to give a ballpark estimate of an algorithm's efficiency.  In this case, the metric being used is the number of data fetches the CPU needs to get to the specific location that it's looking for.<p>O(1) means that the number of possible CPU instructions is constant, no matter how large n is.  So a static array lookup is O(1) because, no matter how large N is, the CPU only has to do a fetch.  That's 1 instruction, and while the actual time is variable due to cache misses, the total number of instructions is constant.<p>O(log n) means that it will take log n operations to get the result.  Binary trees are a great example.  Assuming a perfectly balanced BST, the worst possible number of lookups(i.e. to the farthest leaf) will be log n different fetches.  If you have a system that creates 127 buckets, the worst possible number of lookup operations is 7, which is log base 2 of 128.",1334180356

With this approach, (it seems like) you would still have to render the highest zoom level first, which already takes 3/4 the render time anyway. There are lots of other optimizations you can do (and they probably are doing) there, but they aren't related to the tree/reference-based ones mentioned here.<p>The presentation also seems to overstate the redundancy found in the land tiles. You would get savings from water tiles at all zoom levels, which would be enormous, but (looking at <a href=""http://mapbox.com/maps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mapbox.com/maps</a>) even if humans only cover 1% of the land, our infrastructure is well enough distributed that it and inland water and other details they've included would preclude redundancy at all but the highest zoom levels (although, in this case, the highest zoom level taking up 3/4 of the tiles <i>saves</i> the most).<p>With that in mind, I'm wondering about the claimed rendering time of 4 days. That fits nicely with the story told, but with the 32 render servers mentioned at the end, that would seem to be 128 CPU days (though I'm not sure about the previous infrastructure they were comparing it to), which is actually close to the count mentioned early on with a super-optimized query and render process. This is all just supposition, so I don't want to sound too sure of myself, but the storage savings seems to be the big win here (60% from water + redundancy at highest zoom levels), while I would guess that you would save considerably less in processing (15% from water + minor redundancy on land (absent other optimizations e.g. run-length-based ones)).",1334178917

The reason it's a problem in normal programs is because there usually isn't code there (and with memory protection, you probably aren't allowed to access that space, which is the error you often see).<p>The CPU doesn't care if the address is all 0s, that's not special to the CPU. So when it turns on it just starts executing at some hard-wired address. That could be 0x0000, 0x8000, or it could be something really random like 0x48C4. Somewhere in the chip's documentation it says what the address is. Once the CPU has power, it loads the first instruction from that address, and then it executes everything as normal.<p>So you wire up the computer so that some little piece of ROM (for example the BIOS) sits at that address. When the chip turns on, you know what instructions it will start executing.<p>Once things are going, you could set things up to be more complicated (such toggling pins to signal the ROM chip to stop listening so you could map normal RAM into that address), but that's the basic idea.",1334178450

For example, the theoretical advantages of hopscotch hashing rest on data locality concerns.  On a hypothetical machine for which memory access always takes the same amount of time, I believe - but have not bothered to prove - that hopscotch hashing and other open addressing techniques should actually be slower than other forms of collision resolution.<p>As for how it affects the question of imperative vs. functional data structure performance, it should tend to favor the imperative ones.  The issue is that purely functional data structures aren't allowed to just grab a block of memory all at once and insert data into it at leisure.  (That would be a form of mutation.)  Instead space has to be allocated as it is needed, in a piecemeal fashion.  As a result, longer-lived and more active purely functional data structures will tend to scatter across the heap over time.",1334178251

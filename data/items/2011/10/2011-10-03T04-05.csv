3065096,comment,3064691,3065036,1,0,turing,,,"They do in many ways, at least indirectly.<p>One possible outlet we discussed for encouraging students to forgo careers in banking and consulting was financial aid. Suppose Yale instituted a policy that accepting financial aid required an agreement to forgo consulting and banking positions for at least 2 years after graduation. This would decrease the number of students who choose such careers  ""just because."" Other students who intend to go into such careers would surely be drawn away to other fields during the waiting period. Of course, those who do not qualify for financial aid, and those who can afford to deny the aid they are offered, would not be affected by such a measure. This would warrant a consideration of whether the class divide on post-graduation freedom is undesirable. Then again, I don't think it would be unreasonable for Yale to say: ""We are offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, an education at an amazing school you would otherwise not be able to afford. The only condition is that you must do something productive with it.""<p>There's also the possibility of positive reinforcement as opposed to the negative scenarios outlined above. What if Yale offered additional financial aid to those who agreed to teach/do research/pursue charitable work for two years after graduation?",1317617510

To see the absurdity of the claim, reword the argument thus:<p>""There are no clubs that will make you elite. In fact, there are no elite clubs.""<p>But, of course this is <i>not</i> true, there are clubs for which membership shows eliteness. This is not a physical property, it is agreed upon by the relative strata of society.<p>Similarly, there definitely are elite languages, i.e. ones for which understanding and use confers some sort of eliteness to the programmer. This is different from being a good (or great) programmer, so the examples of great programmers he's known is irrelevant. Eliteness, to me, is not the same as coolness or the next big thing either, i.e. for most people Lisp (or a dialect, say, Scheme) is elite although it's old.",1317617486

I know you meant that with the best intentions but your comment came out really snobby.<p>Are finance and consulting valuable fields or should they just be abolished altogether?  Given how some of these people are paid, one can at least say that it is valuable from a monetary point of view.  If these fields are indeed valuable, then who should fill the positions if not Yalies?  Should state school students fill those roles because it is not beneath them to make a lot of money?<p>A field is either worthy or unworthy of a person's time.  There's no need to say it's unworthy of a Yalie's time.  To say that and then follow it with how blessed and lucky you are, makes people think you think Yalies should aspire to some higher standard that others don't have to.  It's kind of arrogant.<p>At the end of the day, even Yalies have to eat and satisfy their material needs.  It's silly to think that they're somehow immune to the desires most humans have.  The Yale admission process doesn't filter out applicants based on that.  It does optimize for high achievement and ambition.  Given that, why would anyone really expect Yalies to avoid careers that are financially rewarding and, until recently, quite prestigious?<p>-Yale Alum in tech",1317617474

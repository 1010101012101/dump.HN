397773,comment,396218,397014,0,0,stcredzero,,,"After my previous post, I was thinking, and it occurred to me that putting the VM in the kernel would skip the user-> kernel-> user transition.  So one would put it there, not in user land.<p>Somehow I don't think multicore will be an issue with the iPhone for some time to come.  Also, putting all of the user-app background processing on a specially designated processor on a multicore mobile device actually sounds like a good idea.<p>I'm certainly not an expert in this sort of thing.  Again, my point is really -- okay, Apple says that OS X is not safe enough for background processes on a phone, so why don't they try <i>this</i> ultra-paranoid VM?<p>As for how I'm thinking of this: there is always some small overhead for real context switches and exception handling.  If some malicious program decides to be obnoxious, then this can still be felt by the user.  If all user applications are creating background processes and Hardin's ""Tragedy of the Commons"" takes hold, then my experience with all desktop OS I've seen makes me suspect that the user will still feel some small effect.  I was trying to come up with a way that you could eliminate even this.<p>Also, I know for a fact that the virtual exception handler in Smalltalk VMs is a lot cheaper from the POV of the OS.  It's just normal execution of the app, as far as the OS and other processes go.  I can pop off exceptions like it's going out of fashion and no one else cares.  They're like ""green exceptions.""<p>Programming without synchronous anything is exactly what I had in mind for background code.  The OS gets all the advantages.  The VM is just the ultra-paranoid option to make sure that there are no unpredictable battery-life or security downsides.  (There can still be parts of the API that look synchronous to the background  user app code.)  The foreground part will need to get the results off of some sort of lightweight message passing mechanism.",1229298392

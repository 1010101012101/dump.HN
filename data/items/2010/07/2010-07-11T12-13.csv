1505409,comment,1505006,1505026,0,0,hga,,,"I find that premise (""lack of industry"") difficult or impossible to believe.  The real (inflation adjusted value) manufacturing output of the US is doing just fine, it's manufacturing employment that's taken it on the chin.  The US is still doing a lot of the higher value stuff, including R&D which employs scientists.<p>A big problem with industrial employment of scientists is that the deliberate stuffing of the pipeline (e.g. by the NSF starting in the '80s) to keep the price of science labor low also lowers the income of industry scientists.

At least to me, it does not sound totally unbelieveable that he eventually stopped counting days and weeks and rather lived a sequence of days. A very long sequence of days, long enough to make him lose track how long it was.<p>At least to me, this is kind of plausible, because he had no more reference in his days. You know: Hey, every seven days there is this special day where I cannot go shopping if I need something. This coincides with a week going by, and thus, you have a fairly ""natural"" notion of a week. For him, I guess, a day consisted of getting up, checking his surroundings, gathering intelligence, staying hidden, maintaining his weapons and eventually hiding and going to sleep again. Day after day after day.",1278851841

I have never heard of this toxin you are writing about but I think it all fits into the same category.  If you as a parent are actively involved in your child's life, you should never be worried that they are eating the paint off of a toy or drinking the bleach under the sink-- because you are there.<p>When I had my children, I wasn't ready.  I was young and selfish-- I had no time for them.  I did not desire to make time for them.  My wife, thank the maker, was the exact opposite.  She gave up everything to be mommy and eventually I came around.  I discovered that my children are <i>not</i> a burden, and I have found less and less time for the things I <i>used</i> to enjoy because I now enjoy my children.<p>Because my wife and I are always with our girls, we can proactively coach them away from eating things they are not supposed to or chewing on things that could be harmful.  It is like you said, things were likely a lot worse when we were kids.  Lead was everywhere.  I have been a fisherman since i was born and I cannot tell you how many sinkers I have swallowed-- maybe some day this will have profound effects on me, but not yet.",1278851256
1505387,comment,1505157,1505298,0,0,Kadin,,,"That may be true, but it's not as though Wikileaks has been particularly well-managed, or done much to decrease their (by which I mean 'his') exposure.   There has been a lot of what appears to be, to put it bluntly, showboating, intentional or otherwise.<p>I can't say whether it stems from a desire for celebrity on Assange's part, which would be totally incompatible with the mission of a site like WL, or if it's unintentional and simply the result of accidental mismanagement.  But either way I don't think it bodes well for the future of the site.<p>That said, I don't think that Assange or Wikileaks in general are critical.  If nothing else, he proved that there is material out there waiting to be released.  The concept, at least in broad strokes, is still sound; it was the execution that was flawed.<p>I think there is an open opportunity right now for someone to step in and do right -- less politically, less bombastically, more securely and more decentralized -- what WL aimed to do.",1278851040

I have seen websites that need scalability cache all the DB queries in memcached, but the queries didn't have any large degree of temporal locality. How is this supposed to do anything other than move the database into memory? Shouldn't the DBMS already do that by itself? The only benefit I can see is that the queries would be memoized instead of having to be run again and again, but I'm not sure that would be such a great advantage if the entire DB was loaded in memory.<p>Anyway, I'm just thinking aloud here, but it seems to me that in many cases you really don't want a caching layer above the DB...",1278849768

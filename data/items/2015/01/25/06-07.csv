That&#x27;s still far more than a lot of lines of work.<p><i>Maybe</i> what you&#x27;re saying is true if you&#x27;re talking about self-employed indie devs, but that&#x27;s not who the article, or your parent post is talking about.

One might rephrase your statement as: the lattice artifacts / discretization errors vanish faster on a hex grid.  Could be.<p>When I worked on fire-spreading models [0] the grids we used were square.  I would wager that this is because it makes thinking significantly easier.  In my current field[1], square lattices are chosen because of the underlying supercomputing architecture.  The communication mesh in tera- and petascale computers tend to be rectangular [2].  At these scales, having a nice rectangular layout of the local subvolumes simplifies communication algorithms and can provide a dramatic speedup---in this case having fewer neighbors is better.<p>[0]:  In high school I implemented the fact that fires burn faster uphill while working for David Keyes on <a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~caliente/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~caliente/</a><p>[1]:  Lattice QCD codes use a (4D spacetime) rectangular lattice <a href=""https://usqcd-software.github.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://usqcd-software.github.io/</a><p>[2]:  The BlueGene/Q, for example, is a 5-dimensional rectangular torus.",1422169037

8942251,comment,8941756,8941756,0,0,bsimpson,,,"> The problem is that when we start out as software developers we don’t know the “right way” to do things so we are less constrained in what we do.  We just march forward and go do things.\nAs we start to learn the “right way” to do things, we are often stifled by that knowledge and the constraints it brings and that causes us to be less productive or to over engineer and design solutions to problems.<p>I&#x27;ve felt that exact thing my entire career.  I&#x27;m not a classically trained engineer - I&#x27;m a product guy who happens to be really good at building shit.  Spending way too much time on sites like Hacker News over the years has taught me a bunch about how Internet loudmouths think things should be done.  Learning these things has put me in the upper echelon of developers.  I don&#x27;t think of myself as an engineer, but I&#x27;ve been courted by some of the biggest names in software, and they pay me enough to comfortably afford living in the most expensive city in the country.<p>Yet, in spite of all of that, I&#x27;m fairly confident was more creative when I didn&#x27;t realize that the obvious way wasn&#x27;t always the best way, and I&#x27;ve wondered more than once what I might be making if I wasn&#x27;t always keeping so-called best practices in mind.",1422168911

This is what @coldtea is referring to.<p>In short: even for a relatively easy-to-quantify universe of discourse like Mathematics, this theorem implies that (of necessity) some propositions will not be provably true or false, or that the system will contain a contradiction.  You have a choice of either incompleteness or contradiction (incompleteness seems better).<p>That&#x27;s for Mathematics.  Now, consider physics, biology, or sociology.

8942235,comment,8939885,8942179,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Very large companies, particularly public but not limited to such, start drifting toward the cheapest product they can get away with while maximizing profit. That&#x27;s their obligation to share holders after all.<p>This is largely a myth. Corporate executives have an obligation to shareholders, but that obligation is not to maximize quarterly profits. Short term profit maximization at all costs is generally <i>not</i> in the interests of shareholders. If you have a reputation for selling a quality product you can capitalize on it in the short term by selling a junk product at quality prices and huge profit margins, but in any kind of a competitive market that opens you up to exactly what you would expect. Someone else comes in with a real quality product at the same price and you lose all your business to them.<p>The reason corporate executives do things like that isn&#x27;t because they&#x27;re satisfying their obligation to the shareholders -- they&#x27;re doing quite the opposite. But they do it anyway because of how they&#x27;re <i>compensated</i>. Big bonus at the end of the year if profits are up; no repercussions if it tanks the company by the end of the decade because by then you&#x27;re working somewhere else.<p>It&#x27;s important to make the distinction because the shareholders are the ones who have the power to do something about it. &quot;Obligation to the shareholders&quot; makes it sound like the shareholders are the beneficiaries, but they&#x27;re just as much victims as the customers. Making that mistake is how they become the victims.",1422167995

8942226,comment,8940967,8941957,0,0,danjayh,,,"I think the biggest problem caused by the change in the cost and the availability of food was actually the cost itself. People can afford to consume more calories without going broke, and so they do - too many calories. I regularly eat fast food (probably 2-3x a week), but I get something that has a reasonable number of calories and skip the soda (which is just raw sugar) ... I have not become obese, and it has not had detrimental effects on my health. For example, a reasonable lunch at McDonad&#x27;s might be a McDouble, and perhaps a small fry now and then. The McDouble is 390 Calories, and the small fry is 230. If you figure on fries every other time you get McDonalds, that averages out to a 505 Calorie lunch, which definitely will not add anything to your waistline.<p>The famous &quot;documentary&quot; by Michael Moore (who, personally, I can&#x27;t stand) was based on the premise that he&#x27;d ALWAYS add any extras suggested by the restaurant (fries, coke, super-size, etc.) Eating like that, it&#x27;s no surprise that he&#x27;s morbidly obese.",1422167697

And from my own experience, I&#x27;d say it has changed me probably more than anything else I tried, in ways I can&#x27;t describe. I&#x27;d rather see someone responsible take ecstasy once or once a year, even though it&#x27;s addictive and potentially neurotoxic, especially without antioxidants, it tends to be a spectacularly positive experience, emotionally and psychologically, a lifetime event. Also there are studies about how it may help against neurosis, shyness and all. And doing it with close friends or a lover, will give memories to cherish. At least it did for me. It&#x27;s dangerously addictive and very negatively connotated, it doesn&#x27;t have the esoterically intellectual marketing appeal of LSD, but I&#x27;d dare say it&#x27;s more intellectually interesting, in that its rewards are clear, human and real.<p>There are a lot of people who take LSD regularly, so it&#x27;s not that risky, but it&#x27;s not trivial, especially for intellectual people with anxiety, higher sensitivity, and often difficult lives and childhood.

8942216,comment,8940866,8940866,0,0,asa400,,,"Warning: wall of text ahead.<p>My Erlang experience is admittedly hobbyist, and mostly as a consequence of\nworking my way through Fred&#x27;s excellent <a href=""http://learnyousomeerlang.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnyousomeerlang.com/</a> and\nfooling around with side projects.<p>As I see it, Erlang does a lot of cool stuff, at a semantic and systems level,\nbut utterly fails when it comes to things like approachability and marketing.\nThese topics are universal to all languages, so I feel that my experience as a\nrelative noob may help to illuminate the general outsider&#x27;s perception.<p>First, the things it does well (taken from my admittedly tiny experience with the\nsystem):<p>- Simple language: I love that the surface area of the language really is not\n  that large.<p>- Concurrency is built in to the core: unlike most languages, the concurrency\n  story is just &quot;there&quot;. There isn&#x27;t fuss or ceremony or terror around it. It\n  has been well thought out, and learning actors in their beautiful Erlang\n  implementation helped me take that knowledge elsewhere (mainly Scala, which\n  I&#x27;ll come back to).<p>- Legacy: you hear about the systems people have built with it and it just blows\n  your mind. The ability of the language and runtime to behave as a cohesive,\n  robust unit exists in few other places, if at all. The sort of reliability and\n  scale achieved as a result of this fact is incredible.<p>And not so well:<p>- Beginner&#x27;s story: The build tool was not immediately apparent, and it seemed\n  like the community had still not settled on one. The dependency story seemed\n  primitive and still not settled. The repl is pretty shit compared to every\n  other repl I&#x27;ve ever used: ruby, python, clojure, scala, etc. These are\n  obviously &quot;subjective&quot; perceptions, but I&#x27;m a fairly captive audience. I\n  <i>already wanted</i> to learn Erlang, so these things will put me off much less\n  than someone who has to be sold on it.<p>- General marketing: everyone keeps talking about phone switches and Whatsapp, but I&#x27;m\n  not writing software for a phone switch or Whatsapp. I know Erlang works for\n  other uses because I&#x27;ve seen some of the cool stuff the community has done,\n  but I don&#x27;t think the rest of the world goes out of their way to find awesome\n  uses. It&#x27;s still seen as this extremely narrow, focused language, when\n  actually people are using it for all sorts of things. A robust general-purpose\n  library ecosystem goes a long way to address this, as people see a lib for\n  their task and go, &quot;ahh, a library for Foo! I can use Erlang!&quot;<p>- Reliability marketing: Reliability for most programmers is not &quot;Nine 9&#x27;s of\n  uptime&quot;. It&#x27;s &quot;how badly does this environment let me fuck up before everything\n  goes to hell?&quot; They are effectively two sides of the same coin, with one\n  focused on a negative and the other on a positive. I see a huge, neglected\n  part of Erlang&#x27;s potential sell in its inability to market itself\n  as letting you move faster and break more things. This doesn&#x27;t mean you get to\n  be an idiot, but it effectively says to the programmer &quot;I&#x27;m going to make it\n  harder for you to create a brittle system. Go on and try to build that\n  adventurous new feature, because I&#x27;ve got your back if shit hits the fan&quot;.<p>Related to these points is that there are other environments that get people\n&quot;most of the way there&quot; without having to learn a totally alien ecosystem. These\nare, namely, Go and Scala.<p>Erlangers will argue that with Go or Scala you may get some of the features of\nErlang, you don&#x27;t get the whole package. This is true, but people don&#x27;t think\nthis way. People think &quot;does this sufficiently solve my problem, and does it do\nso at a cost I can live with?&quot; For people familiar with C, the cost of doing a\nGo project is minimal. Basically, you get concurrency and GC taken care of,\nwhile maintaining most of the syntax, semantics, deployment strategy, and\nprogramming styles you already know.<p>With Scala, you get robustness, concurrency, and distributed computing\nin the form of Akka (to a level that satisfies most people), while preserving\naccess to Java libraries.<p>Personally, Scala&#x27;s arguments have been persuasive to me, which is why I&#x27;m\nattempting to introduce it at work in lieu of Erlang. In addition to being\nmore approachable for my mostly Ruby and Javascript-programming colleagues\nthan Erlang (I concede that this point is definitely debatable), I can do\nnearly goddamn anything in Scala: data analysis, NLP, network services,\nwebapps,number crunching, etc. I work mostly in data on a team that has a\nlarge deployment of microservices, and for many questions we face I wouldn&#x27;t\neven know where to begin in Erlang. Scala, despite its flaws in terms of binary\ncompatibility, immaturity, type-snobbery, retains a relentlessly practical,\nmarketable feel, that I feel much more confident in bringing before a group of\nprogrammers who know neither ecosystem.<p>If the Erlang community hopes to see the language and system achieve greater\ngeneral adoption, it has to learn to sell to the general case. It doesn&#x27;t have\nto win, but it has to make it easy for people to reap Erlang&#x27;s amazing features\nwhile not missing their Java, Ruby, or Python libs too much, or taking too long\nto get started.

And our government doesn&#x27;t help. E.g. we mandate using huge percentages of our corn crop to make Ethanol as a gasoline additive.

Windows 95, that needed a 386 minimum, was a true protected mode system, with virtual memory and pre-emptive multitasking. It would be absurd to call it &quot;a DOS program&quot; just because you could launch it from the DOS prompt.<p>So the same can be said of Windows 3.

There are lots of philanthropists in the world, with lots of money.<p>Yes, those things are true. There are also <i>people</i> over there, and their participation matters at least as much as (and I would argue much more than) that of the wealthy elite.<p>In the case of the &quot;carbon-sucking gizmo&quot;, the cure is worse than the disease. Even Branson-level cash can&#x27;t change thermodynamics and evolution.<p>The Virgin Challenge finalists are conspicuously absent in their energy and land use analyses. I expect they suffer from the same problems as previous CCS &quot;solutions&quot; — energetically they can&#x27;t compete with simply shutting down a coal plant, and in land use they can&#x27;t compete with reseeding farmland to forest.

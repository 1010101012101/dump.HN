9065368,comment,9062132,9062871,0,0,pdkl95,,,"That link seems to encourage <i>raising</i> the latency, which suggests the needs of people like musicians are not being considered at all. Your use-cases are not the only use cases that exist.<p>The entire world of music production uses JACK, which got the design right well before PulseAudio even existed. It can provide <i>synchronous</i> operation to prevent drifting between audio tools. I include mplayer2 as one of those tools for s few things. More importantly, JACK guarantees a reliable <i>very, very low latency</i> audio path.<p>How &quot;low latency&quot; do I mean? Consider that in printed music, while somewhat uncommon, quite a few pieces have been written that use 128th notes. That would be anywhere from ~80ms to ~10ms note lengths, depending on the tempo. Larger latencies mean notes being heard as a different note from what was played, and I keep JACK down to about 5ms latency, and would set it lower if I could afford new hardware. Notes are not the only feature of musinc, and some headroom is needed. Any latencies higher than about 10ms-20ms I would consider broken and unusable.<p>(Incidentally - I cannot play GuitarHero/RockBand on most TVs either because of horrible latench. A (60Hz) video, a two frame delay is a &quot;miss&quot; on the harder songs. those 16.6ms latencies are nasty regardless which direction the latency is being added)<p>Beyond that, JACK is a great API. It makes it trivial to do a LOT of the common needs (i.e. &quot;Just give me the audio samples...&quot; or &quot;just let me write new audio data and not have to  worry about anything else... such as timing&quot;)",1424210365

Most car insurance companies won&#x27;t cover you if you&#x27;re using your vehicle commercially unless you get a commercial policy. You could be put into the position of having nobody to foot the bill in the case of an accident. The market will eventually adjust to these new kinds of insurance customers, but if the insurance companies start catering to Uber drivers, that could cause problems for them seeing as how ride-sharing is illegal in many if not most places.<p>So the insurance companies could be exposed to legal risk for facilitating illegal businesses, just as banks would be exposing themselves to criminal liabilities if they start catering to the marijuana industry. So they have to be careful. All increasing the risk of you getting into an accident and having no one but yourself to pay the hospital bills and getting sued by the other party or your customer for failing to carry proper insurance.

New information is arriving at such a fast pace that it’s difficult for even scholars to keep up.&quot; That&#x27;s about right. The article kindly submitted here does a good job of reviewing some of the back-and-forth about how <i>Homo sapiens</i> has thought about Neanderthal fossils and what archaeology suggests about our near cousins over the years, with a variety of different ideas about Neanderthals coming and going. The latest word is that Neanderthals were smarter than we used to think.[2]<p>Of course the article mentions that there are traces of gene assemblages that were first found in ancient Neanderthal DNA that are actually fairly commonplace in living human beings (which is the main point of the <i>New Yorker</i> article). So in that sense, the Neanderthals are not so much &quot;lost cousins&quot; as common ancestors among other ancestors of our brothers and sisters.

The API for doing that is not stable, and I suspect the build system doesn&#x27;t make it easy. Want to initialise kdbus under another init system? Even though it should have absolutely no dependency on systemd whatsoever, the component which does so is tied into systemd and can&#x27;t be removed from it.<p>On the other hand, there&#x27;s systems like nosh[0] which prove that you <i>can</i> build UNIX-y composable programs to solve many of the problems that systemd set out to solve. If you want to replace the logger, go ahead! If you want some component of it without using the whole init system, that&#x27;s doable too. With only a little work, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be possible to run much of nosh as non-PID-1.<p>(Note that I&#x27;m not suggesting anyone use nosh - the code is a tad weird and it&#x27;s hard to find things, and the build system is extremely non-standard. However, it makes a useful proof of concept that the tightly-coupled systemd is not the only way to build something better than the SysV init system.)<p>[0] <a href=""http://homepage.ntlworld.com/jonathan.deboynepollard/Softwares/nosh.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/jonathan.deboynepollard/Softwar...</a>",1424209899

9065314,comment,9063843,9064926,0,0,rxin,,,"The example was mostly a toy example. The power really comes when you get interactivity for small data and big data. Using this, you could scale up to TBs of data on a cluster and still get results relatively fast, which is not something you can do with R.<p>I don&#x27;t expect at small scale to beat R yet. There are a few low-hanging fruits for single node performance. For example, even for single node data, we incur a &quot;shuffle&quot; to do data exchange in aggregations.

Lel.<p>I appreciate that the author was in the Theater of Operations. I respect that he has an enormous amount of anecdotal data about military personnel and conflict. That being said, this person appears to have a rather shallow understanding of the nature of conflicts as it pertains to Geo-politics.<p>To say the US has not won a war since Korea is idiotic, as the US did NOT win; there is a de facto state of war between the Koreas and the US is bound to the South by alliance. I get the feeling that the author is European (just a guess). I wonder what the answers would be if you asked a large range of people (age and nation of association) who won WWII. Asking an American who won the Cold War will probably yield a more homogeneous pool of responses. Ask a N.Korean who won the Korean Conflict and the diversity of answers would drop even further. The point is that anyone can say anything that they want; the winners are decided over and over again culturally as well as historically. There has not been a &#x27;real&#x27; war since the Second Global Conflict in terms of losses in material and personnel. If the Ukraine Conflict becomes a shooting war between Russia and Ukraine, the losses in one week could total the entire losses of the US in the ten years of brush beating. 5K soldiers is a paltry sum: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll</a> .<p>The world has not known war in many years, and it is precisely because of the political efforts of the US, Russia, England & Friends, and more recently China. They do this not out of compassion for their citizens, but out of necessity for their profits.<p>In forums like these, people love to belabor the trope that war brings technological advances and benefits the D-Con companies solely. They use this as some sort of reasoning behind why the US invades the countries it does. This is silly. War turns an economy to shit. It does this to both sides, though obviously it takes longer for the &#x27;victor&#x27; to feel it. Peace == Prosperity. Regardless of the &#x27;billions&#x27; that are said to be invested in America&#x27;s wars, they are trickles compared to the naked power of a well cared for middle class. There is so much more money to be made when people are free to save it and spend it. this is the fundamental principle behind US Capitalism: 1)make peace through force 2)inundate with currency 3)?????? 4) Middle class appears.<p>Instead of large wars heralding dramatic shifts in power and means, a background of smaller conflicts in emerging raw material provider countries keeps the weapons sales up and makes the way for more ethnically homogeneous locals when the drilling crews show up.<p>One can say the US loses, and on many counts we do. But the world* wins. We invaded Iraq to stabilize oil supplies, guarantee supremacy, and foment regime change: the European and Chinese oil supply, the supremacy of Saudi Arabia over Iran, and regime change in the Middle Eastern monarchies.<p>Somewhat non sequitur, but if you want to learn about an amazing american geo-political victory that used some of that &#x27;excessive&#x27; spending, try to find info about the shadow campaign waged across the -stans to secure power and water as a preemptive strike against nascent extremist populations. Good luck; there is not much documentation ou there.<p>Having a clear definition of terms is important, both in conflict as well as in blogposts.<p>*Europe",1424209709

Why is it worse? What can we do to correct that discrepancy?<p>I will go so far as to say your suggestion to &quot;focus on the problem <i>in full generality</i>&quot; -- which is to say, to completely encompass an impossibly complicated issue -- is just a way of trying to pass responsibility and to avoid admitting that there is a problem. Of course, trying to resolve sexism everywhere is admirable. But to use the existence of sexism in other fields as a reason to avoid addressing it in our own is little better than rejecting its existence altogether.<p>edit for your edit: I think there are specific reasons that sexism is more prevalent in tech, which are not necessarily related to &quot;software people are ignorant&quot;. In our culture there appears to be a general bias against women in pretty much all STEM fields, perhaps for historical reasons. I suspect (although this is just my opinion) that this is largely responsible for any greater bias that exists in tech as well. There is a mistaken perception that women are less capable in highly rational pursuits, which affects how women in tech are viewed by their colleagues.

Building a plugin is definitely an interesting idea; I hadn&#x27;t thought of that before. I guess the problems would be three-fold. First, I don&#x27;t know how to do that :-). Second, there are probably a bunch of ethical concerns/IRB issues that would stand in the way of academic publishing (but thats not huge). Third, and the only fundamental issue, is that the self-selection into using that plug-in would bias the estimates of intrinsic quality. Still its a pretty good idea but I&#x27;m currently trying to get access to more fine-grained data in other ways, so we&#x27;ll see.<p>In terms of creating your own site, a few researchers [1,2] have already done this and have some interesting work. But even with that, you still have the problem of accounting for position bias within the site (like HN doesn&#x27;t really know if you skimmed the title of an article and decided to ignore it, or never read the title at all). But the experimental power you get with that is pretty cool.<p>And I have totally read that Facebook cascades paper and have more than a few thoughts about it. In fact, I have adapted their prediction-style results to the MusicLab data and you get really strong predictive accuracy (like 90-95% in terms of predicting whether a song will eventually be above the median popularity). However the accuracy you would achieve on Reddit or Hacker News data is considerably lower. I didn&#x27;t really include those results in my paper because I&#x27;m not sure how they fit yet.<p>If I had one critique (which is not really a critique but a comment) is that the Facebook study doesn&#x27;t really contradict Watts&#x27; point that popularity is hard to predict. The Facebook study shows that if you can observe the &quot;initial conditions&quot;, then you can predict eventual outcomes pretty well but that&#x27;s directly in line with the rich-get-richer effect that Watts et el demonstrate. To put it pithily, its easy to predict who gets richer if you observe who is rich.<p>Anyway, I could geek out about this for a long time but feel free to drop me an email at stoddardg [at] gmail.com if you&#x27;re interested in chatting some more.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.6744.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.6744.pdf</a>

There is no cut and dry &quot;Women cannot apply to this position.&quot; Instead it seems to be things like comments about the dress being fun which to me seem rather ambiguous about their intentions. I wouldn&#x27;t consider that to be sexist, if I said that I would intend it as a compliment but I see stuff all the time about how seemingly innocent things like that are apparently sexist. It just doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to me. Even the recounting of guy talking about the Facebook internship seemed to me as if the guy was trying to joke about how she must be smart, so he should apply; as if he was trying to imply that it would have been a good idea/opportunity. I didn&#x27;t interpret that incident as meaning that the guy thought he should get the internship over the girl, since she most certainly wasn&#x27;t the only intern at Facebook over the summer.",1424207036

9064953,comment,9064257,9064559,0,0,HillRat,,,"You make some solid points, but let me take issue with a few:<p><i>Army should not do police work. There should be para-military units (gendarme) composed from locals, but from different regions. US did great job at Philippines with this strategy.</i><p>Not sure I would hold up the Philippine War as a paragon of US military involvement; Otis&#x27; war strategy essentially consisted of concentration camps, wholesale slaughter (e.g., the Moro Crater Massacre), the deliberate blockading and starvation of urban populations, and commonplace torture and summary execution of enemy soldiers and innocent civilians alike, all waged in the name of &quot;liberty,&quot; &quot;democracy&quot; and freedom from a warlike religion -- though the religion in that case was Catholicism, not Islam. Fluency in Tagalog wasn&#x27;t necessary when your primary method of communication was the sharp end of a bayonet. An average day in the Philippines made My Lai look like a Amnesty International convention.<p><i>75% of servants in army (support roles) is pretty stable number since Roman Legions times.</i><p>Actually, the &quot;tooth-to-tail&quot; ratio has steadily increased in favor of logistical support; US combat brigades in World War One consisted of about 78% fighting soldiers, versus about 43% of a current combined arms brigade (for theatre-level forces, the numbers were 53% to 25%, respectively. The fighting strength of theatre-level forces in Iraq is actually below the Jackson-Nunn threshold mandated for Western European forces.) But, as you point out, this isn&#x27;t the entire story; what the author fails to understand is that it takes a <i>lot</i> of logistical footprint to support every one of those special forces teams. Furthermore, once you start adding in Abrams armor, SBCTs, Navy ships, Marine and Air Force aviation, and all the rest of the panoply of modern war, plus the need to provide &quot;blankets, beans and bullets,&quot; it&#x27;s remarkable the military has a 1:3 warfighter ratio. (To put it another way, the author would be well-advised to recall the old military maxim, &quot;Amateurs talk about strategy; professionals worry about logistics.&quot;)<p><i>BTW Russians captured Crimea with 2 casualties, so much about &#x27;not enough deaths&#x27;.</i><p>But hundreds of Russian soldiers have died in Eastern Ukraine since then, though the Kremlin has been burying (so to speak) the actual extent of casualties (cynically, Putin doesn&#x27;t mind getting his soldiers killed, it&#x27;s the gravedigging he hates). The US isn&#x27;t the most protective of its soldiers -- that honor probably goes to Israel, the &quot;Hannibal Protocol&quot; notwithstanding -- but for a country engaged in a decade and a half of open warfare, it&#x27;s remarkably loathe to endanger its warfighters.",1424206969

Does that mean something?<p>The Hicksdesign tweet also says something about the convenience of having ""a connection wherever you are"" = Freedom?<p>I don't know, but here is what I think:<p>Opera is already serving millions of mobile users through their proxy servers. I think there is support in the upcoming version of Opera(v10) to connect to the web though the proxy server. Now they certainly would want to monetize this traffic. What would they do?\nGive internet connection for free (using some USB device) and then serve ads. But how does this USB device connect to the servers? May be they have made a tie up with some telecom majors.<p>Of course, this is also a speculation , just as ridiculous as the OP.",1244901131

656128,comment,656107,656107,0,0,jonhohle,,,"I'm not familiar with the author, but I don't see why embedding the server would change things. Mac OS X has had one-click Apache since it was released and I would imagine OS X has a larger active install base than Opera. Of course, Opera has had a lot of innovation trickle into other browsers (tabs, thumbnails, etc.), so maybe they've solved some other issues involved with personal web hosting.<p>The ""hard parts"" would be reliable dns resolution, finding common ISP open ports, and security of all kinds.",1244901032

656122,comment,656107,656107,0,0,liuliu,,,"This couldn't be true. By embedding a web server, you imply that all mainstream routers are aware of the web server thing and can route a query to itself correctly to the desired computer. As the IPv4 thing and all the huge local network used in family (your wireless router) and enterprise, a embedding web server can hardly serve anything on the Internet unless you get router manufacturers' support.<p>Still, you can achieve the ""web server"" thing by establishing a client-server connection to the Opera central server and the Opera central server will act like a ""router"". That, is more like what Windows Live file sharing feature.<p>Opera all these years acts like a good citizen with W3C's guideline. There is no way for Opera to support two-way ajax because there is no general standard.",1244900460

656117,comment,656012,656106,0,0,sho,,,"You're not replying to me, but I want to respond anyway. I hate advertising for two main reasons:<p>1. It is mostly ugly and aesthetically displeasing. I care about how things look and take steps to seek out and appreciate things I like looking at (eg art, OSX) and avoid things I don't (advertising, Windows)<p>2. I recognise the human brain is a flawed machine and susceptible to clever manipulation, even when the person knows he is being manipulated. Thus, I avoid any contact with known-manipulative forms of messaging whereever possible - this includes most forms of advertising. I have no such aversion to, say, movie trailers (I generally love them) or local business catalogues, etc, since they are informational only and do not try to manipulate me. By the way, if you think you're immune to this manipulation, you are 1. in the vast majority of people and 2. provably wrong.<p>And I do dislike excessive consumerism, especially around christmastime, and credit advertising for spurring it on - but whatever, people can do what they want.<p>You always mentioning this ""free, advertising-supported internet"" but that is a simplistic view, IMO. The price of ""free"" is that you are expected to view, absorb, and presumably act on, commercial messaging. There is no immediate monetary charge, no, but there certainly is a cost.",1244899740

Not only do I not touch ads in any business activities, I do not place ads on any of my personal sites either. I pay for them, then, out of my own pocket - to the tune of about $250/m.

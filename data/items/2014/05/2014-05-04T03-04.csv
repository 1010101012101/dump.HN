7693240,comment,7692332,7692332,2,0,A1kmm,,,"I think the problem here is they were trying to solve two different problems, but were trying solutions that solve only one or the other at a time, and then complaining it made the other worse:<p><pre><code>  1. It should not be possible to draw a rectangle wider than a certain diameter and length through the points (at any orientation).\n  2. The distance between any point and the nearest neighbouring point must not exceed a specified threshold.\n</code></pre>\nAn easy way to sample points from a random distribution but with additional constraints applied would be to do rejection sampling - if a point doesn&#x27;t meet the constraints, reject it and start again. For this to work, you would need to formulate your constraints based on the number of points accepted so far so you don&#x27;t reject all the points (for example, sample the first few points randomly, and then sample the next points using rejection criteria based on a multiple of the theoretical minimum values of the distance between points / size of the rectangles for the number of points sampled so far).<p>This requires being able to efficiently work out the greatest distance between points and finding the largest rectangle of a given width. You could do the former with a quad-tree; if the new candidate point is too close to the nearest neighbour, reject it; if it is accepted, add it to the quad-tree. For the rectangles, you could optimise by creating a Fibonacci heap with the largest rectangle so far for each point - the largest rectangle will never get bigger as you add more points, so you should be able to do much better than O(n^2) time in the number of points (I haven&#x27;t verified this, however) because you can skip checking most points most times.",1399175943

Or are you suggesting that Apple should make a laptop with a 500GB spinning disk in the base model? Because funnily enough, they have one; the non-retina 13&quot; MBP.

If a server process is accessing it, then it must have the key, at the very least, in memory (which root can access, though finding the key might be somewhat of a feat).

7693166,comment,7692167,7692167,1,0,beloch,,,"There are gains yet to be realized besides reducing the size of the process.  For example, reversible (a.k.a. isentropic or adiabatic) computing offers a way to reduce heat generation, which might combine with 3D construction in interesting ways.  New ways of designing chips might allow progress to continue, but they&#x27;re hard and risky. They&#x27;re not terribly attractive as long as shrinking the process offers predictable advances and remains economically feasible.<p>Still, it&#x27;s worth taking a moment to appreciate how crazy just getting under 10 nm is.  The wavelength of light that is visible to the human eye starts at around 380 nm.  Looking at a 10 nm chip with violet light would be like trying to navigate your house by sonar using a sub-woofer as your emitter!",1399172971

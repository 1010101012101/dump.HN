682396,comment,682265,682265,0,0,pj,,,"The question is: Who is the customer?  You could say the customer is the student who pays the university for the education.  Or you could say the customer is the employer who hires the graduate.<p>There has been the impression in the past that getting a degree meant getting a job, but this is not the case.  Employers, who have more at stake when hiring don't have to wait 4 years to learn whether or not their ""purchase"" was a good one.  They are learning that the value of a college degree is not much when used as a predictor of job success.  More valid predictors are work experience, internships, side projects, and a work ethic.  None of which are gained in college.  A lot of students think college is enough, but it isn't.<p>This is where the problem starts over the confusion about the customer.  Colleges want students to be enrolled for 4 years.  If college is hard and students don't make the A's they think they deserve simply for attending class, then the student leaves the university for one where an A is easier. The student consumer is buying a product and their product is a good GPA.  A low GPA won't get them a job and that's what they are after.<p>This is a problem with money really.  It's a philosophical life issue.  Is your goal to receive value <i>from</i> the rest of the world, or to create value <i>for</i> the rest of the world.  No one wants to work anymore.  We've gotten lazy and complacent.  The job has become avoiding work, when all too often, doing the work is easier than avoiding it.<p>Life has become too easy for too many.  The rest of the world is eating America's lunch.  Even our president thinks it's fine to ""bailout"" businesses who don't want to put the effort into producing products the world wants to buy. They are losing out to better innovation, better business models, and harder work from their competitors around the world.<p>For too long, education has been selling hope for a better life, a better job, a higher income.  So students go into debt. Debt has allowed universities to continue charging more and more and more over time with deferred payment plans that yield little consequence to the full time student who doesn't yet understand the concept of debt or even <i>money</i>.<p>And let's not forget the parents who spend more time at work than at home teaching their children good values, a work ethic, how to care for themselves, the value of money.<p>America is really in a sad state of affairs. A depression is definitely on the way.  Life has been too easy for too long. It's amazing as I think about it right now, I can <i>feel</i> it.  I can feel the exhuberance evaporating. I can feel the realization setting in that our hopes and dreams for an easy future are being dashed. Only a few people really <i>get</i> it right now.  There is still an air of optimism floating around.  People are thinking, ""No... no really, we can keep going like this... we can.  If only we try.""<p>But we can't.  We can't keep going like this and be worth anything.  What we are doing isn't worth anything.  Who wants to pay for it?  What is the value?  What's the value of your college degree?  What's the value of your employment?  What's the value of your iPod and your 6 room house in the suburbs and your SUV and your $20,000 in credit card debt and $125,000 in student loans.<p>Too many people are falling for the clever sales and marketing strategy of the universities, the car companies, the banks, the real estate agents.  The irrational are the prey.  The predators are eating your money and you are left empty -- today <i>and</i> tomorrow.<p>The easy path is the path to destruction.  You have to <i>work</i>.  You have to <i>think</i>.  You have to analyze and predict and learn <i>math</i>.<p>This stuff is hard folks.  It's hard to do things faster, or cheaper, or better than everyone else.  Mediocrity isn't valuable.  You have to be the cream of the crop.  You have to work and practice and strive for perfection <i>every day</i>.<p>No one said life was going to be easy.  It's even harder now that the competition has become <i>everyone</i> in the world.",1246444893

682388,comment,682101,682212,0,0,wildjim,,,"People should be careful how much they quote Google as their reason for preferring Python.<p>The main reason was when they were standardising on the core-languages they could support, Python was enormously far ahead cf. the competition, so it was an obvious choice.  And now, with all that code investment, you do NOT want to start again.  And if you have the money, of course you'd be interested in hiring the best developers for your code-base.<p>Likewise, I believe Python 3000 is unlikely to used in Google for the forseeable future, due to that same code investment.  I don't think Python 2.6 is fully supported, either...<p>I don't think ""a bit more beginner friendly"" is truly accurate.  Most beginners will look for doc's and books, and for a good few years, recently, there was a dearth of good Python books while there seemed to be a new Ruby or Rails book every month, including several allowing you to d/l them for free.<p>I have to admit that I used to recommend Python to beginners for a long time, as it helped them avoid developing bad habits with the other equally popular ""beginner"" PHP and Visual Basic languages.  These days, it's a toss-up.<p>If the person talks about writing web-apps, I'll tend to recommend Ruby and Rails as it has earlier ROI for a beginner, therefore a lot initially more satisfying.",1246444488

Or why Python has become more popular.  It is worth noting that Python was also mentioned a lot as a teaching tool when its popularity began ramping up, and some universities have replaced Java and Scheme with Python as an introductory language.<p>Python really is not appreciably better than Ruby, in my experience.  Nor will i claim that Ruby is appreciably better than Python.  I personally use Ruby in daily life, and used to use Python prior to discovering Ruby.  Both languages support some really weird warts, inconsistencies, and baggage that they retain for the sake of backwards compatibility.<p>Instead they really do provide different philosophies on life.  To claim that Ruby is a tangled soup of options and syntactic sugar is to miss the point really.  Nor is Ruby is not trying to be all things to all people.  Matz cares about one thing, and that's the ability to let programmers get work done with as few cognitive hurdles sourced from the programming language itself.  Does that mean you have options?  Yes.  Does that mean that it would be better to only have one way to do everything?  Not necessarily.",1246443546

682369,comment,682101,682101,0,0,lisperforlife,,,"I believe it is more of a personal choice than anything else. That said, here are the reasons I like Python more than Ruby.<p>* Namespaces - Ruby has namespaces but when you are reading some code it is very hard to figure out what got mixed into what. This may be more predominant in the Rails world than others. You can exactly know where each one of the classes and methods came from unless you are doing a 'from x import <i>'<p></i> Clean code - I know that with most editors today, you can have clean code. But python's insistence on indentation makes the code appear clean and very readable. This was an excellent design decision.<p>* Method and class invocations need () - This view is very subjective. While ruby's method invocation style gives rise to a lot of DSLs, python's style of invocation means that there are no silly Proc objects. If you need to pass a function to another function just send its name. I am not saying that one way is better than the other but I like python's explicitness here.<p>* OpenStruct by default - This is one of the best design decisions ever. Python uses a very fast implementation of dict for its objects. That means you almost get a javascript kind of object without the clunkiness of javascript.<p>I am biased a little bit towards python as I learnt python first. I do love Ruby's DSLs but I have a heart for Clojure too, in this regard. And I am actually quite happy that Jython 2.5 has come out. I am a little disappointed that Jim jumped over to the IronPython and left Jython hanging. But thanks to him, Python is there on all the major platforms.",1246443501

682365,comment,682101,682299,0,0,wildjim,,,"<i>Everything</i> is an object in Ruby, including the blocks.  I'm not clear how you can't pass around a block -- or is it the block + iterator metadata you're talking about?  I suspect that's just an experience problem, where Python promotes iterators over lambdas so lends itself to a different style of programming;  I'm not sure how often you'd want/need to pass a full iterator around in Ruby.<p>Personally I find blocks far more intuitive than Python's iterators and generators, but that is a subjective thing.<p>WRT Magical Classes, I'm not a fan of everything being stored in a dict.  It seems grossly under-engineered to expose the underbelly as a basic ""dumb"" object;  at the very least, it should've been a ""Class Metadata"" object with attached support methods to make it easier (safer?) to inspect or update.<p>And lastly: there is NEVER just one way to do it!!  Witness the confusion n00b's feel over the join() method:  "","".join([LIST]) where the more intuitive would probably be [LIST].join("","")...  but if you MUST have join() in the string module, why not support the latter as a redirect to the former?<p>Seriously:  this sort of dogma can make certain kinds of algorithms very messy to code.<p>However, my biggest beef with Python is that I seem to have to write a metric buttload of boilerplate and end up with something very Java-esque... <sigh>",1246443105

If you just let them use the free version from the start it is easy for the user to end up thinking ""oh these ads on the side aren't too bad"" or ""oh I don't need to have my company logo at the top"" etc etc - so it is more difficult to get them to convert. Once they have used the version with there logo and no ads (or whatever it is you are offering) it is less likely they will accept downgrading.<p>The other issue with a free trial is it gives you thirty days of your product being out there before you need to get the billing working. Maybe you can launch next week instead of next month.<p>The other thing I like, that is rare to see (and would probably suit your time tracking app), is a working demo. Allow people to use the app without having to create an account or enter an email etc, just have some dummy data and preferably ensure the data is cleaned after each use (to prevent someone entering objectionable material). Most people that are likely to use your app are smart enough to go and click around and see if it is what they want.

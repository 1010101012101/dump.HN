183260,comment,183163,183259,0,0,t-dub,,,"Heh, I just realized I never answered the concurrency issue.  The all-time peak for concurrent users was about 45.  More typical is 15.  However, there is a live audio stream associated with the site which probably tends to encourage more concurrency.",1210150515
183259,comment,183163,183163,0,0,t-dub,,,"I think that this is somewhat dependent on the <i>sort</i> of site you're looking at.  Total user engagement and usage patterns are going to be different on a news site is going to be different than on a social networking site.<p>In any case, on a fledgling social media (i.e. focus on sharing/remixing audio/video/images) that I built for a client, the current user registration is just shy of 2,000.  The number of users who have posted <i>anything</i> is ~700.  The number of users who have posted in the last 30 days is ~350.  The number of users who have posted 3 or more items in the last 30 days is ~100.  The number of users who have commented on a post in the last 30 days is ~150.",1210150354

  It's cut from the same cloth as all the misinformed ""Twitter's Dropping Rails!"" posts

Cross Platform Software Distribution is a <i>challenge</i> for any language/technology. I guess the upvotes for this submission do not imply readers here agree with the viewpoint on Ruby given in the article, but rather think it is an interesting topic worth discussing. (I might be completely wrong in this assumption)<p>I am an active user of Ruby, and agree with you that the author is making over generalized sweeping statements such as:
<i>""yet it's the standard, recommended practice in the Rails community, because it makes it easy to ""guarantee"" behaviour in a given environment""</i><p>There is no silver bullet for software distribution in any particular language. One has to be smart and pragmatic enough to weigh in the pros and cons of static linking/vendoring in their particular case, and then take a wise decision on it.",1210149608
183256,comment,183221,183221,0,0,gojomo,,,"A meta-suggestion: avoid lengthy discussions about such issues. Pick one option quickly, then run experiments to test whether the alternative improves your relevant metrics.  Some issues are too small to invest time in trying to find 'consensus' without hard data.<p>On the issue directly: the web default is to open links in the same window. Opening new windows is in Jakob Nielsen's list of the top ten very worst web design mistakes†. (It's #9 as of his 2007 update.) So skip the discussion, go with that, and later run some tests comparing stay-in-page with open-new-window on whatever metric is important to you. (Page views? Non-annoyed users? Return visits? etc.)<p>† <a href=""http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9605.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9605.html</a>",1210148873
183254,comment,183221,183235,0,0,axod,,,"Several exceptions to this.<p>For example, links received in email, if you view the email via a webmail client gmail for instance, and click on the link, it will open in a new window.<p>I think it depends on the % of users that will want to go back to your app after looking at the link. And with ajax type apps, the back button just doesn't cut it.",1210148751
183253,comment,183203,183203,0,0,michael_dorfman,,,"A nice piece.  I'm not sure why some people find the notion that the object model is usually different from the database model so difficult to understand or accept. I've seen more than one project tie itself in knots trying to write application code directly off the database model of the domain, rather than creating an appropriate object model.",1210148579
183252,comment,183194,183200,0,0,jluedke,,,"1) Well, whats new is the ability to create your own groups, and add any search engine you want. I have seen some sites that are similar but never specifically for search.<p>2) I do find the site useful, and imagine others will to. Granted the iframe tag is not exactly new technology, however I don't think good ideas necessarily need to re-invent the internet. As for the $6 no comment...",1210148365

I'm not trying to remove programmer judgment from the equation; I'm just suggesting that there are some guiding principles that can be offered (and can be said to be more than simply matters of personal preference.)",1210148333

There are certainly  situations where multiple engines are useful. Try out the craigslist group for an example, or the Library group.",1210148301

As an eager 12-year-old, it seemed like I couldn't get it soon enough. But as a software engineer now, I can't stop cringing at this story.<p>So much of the discussion here is focusing on SC and SC2. What about the software development aspect of this story?<p>What's the moral of Patrick Wyatt's tale? I mean, it's hard to argue that there's some parallel universe where Blizzard did things differently and StarCraft was an even BIGGER success. What would that even look like -- it became the national pastime of several countries, instead of just one? Yet I can't help but think how expensive it must have been for them to have made these poor decisions in design, implementation, and planning, each one compounding on top of all the previous ones, constantly delaying their launch.<p>So is the moral of the story, ""here's why you shouldn't code for 'two months from launch' mode""?

5255850,comment,5230259,5233015,1,0,eldavido,,,"I was given the advice I repeated above by an accountant a while ago. Admittedly, I don't recall the reasoning as clearly as I did when first told, but I think the basic idea is that it's more tax efficient to reinvest profits into a C corporation than a partnership or other pass-through entity.<p>Let's puzzle it out. C corporation math:<p>$1 revenue in
let's assume a 50% operating margin, gross profit on $1 of revenue = $0.50
throw in another 10% for SG&A (sales, general, and administrative -- stuff your company does that isn't cost-accounted to production), we now have $0.40<p>Delaware has an 8.7% corporate income tax, reducing our $0.40 to 36.52 cents of free cash, which can be paid out to investors as a dividend or retained in the company for future growth.<p>If paid out, qualifying dividend tax would apply, leaving our investor with about 31 cents of profit. If kept in the company, shareholders would have 36.52 cents to reinvest.<p>Pass-through math:
$1 revenue in
Net profit: 0.40 (same as above)<p>Irrespective of whether profit is distributed or retained, and assuming a 28% individual marginal rate for partners, the partnership is left with 28.8 cents of post-tax profit that they can reinvest or distribute (take out for themselves). A few points from this example:<p>It's basically a wash tax-wise (28.8 cents vs. 31) if the profits are distributed. If profits are reinvested, the C corp has 36.5 cents of the original dollar left vs. 29-31, which will compound very significantly over time. So for a business that pays out most of its profits each year and doesn't reinvest (e.g. typical consulting company), it's likely better and simpler to use a partnership, whereas the C corp is better served for ""asset heavy"" companies with things that depreciate over time.<p>Software is tricky because even though it's an ""asset"" in every sense of the term (""probable future economic benefit"", can be sold, etc.) most accounting systems don't recognize it as such. You should really get a CPA's advice on this, but I think the bottom line is, if you're going to (1) earn profit (most startups don't for a long time) and (2) reinvest a lot into the company, you're likely better off with a C corp, otherwise, for a cash business where most profits are paid out right away (law firm, ad agency, medical practice) you're better with a passthrough entity.<p>Hope this helps",1361428395

The restaurant loses money on every single ""daily deal"" that is redeemed. With LivingSocial or (insert any other daily deal site here) taking half of the deal, the restaurant is simply left with 25% of the revenue generated. This does not even cover our food costs, let alone labor.<p>The rise of daily deal businesses have brought up a couple of fundamental issues for us:
1)Customers are often daily deal hunters - We would be willing to take the one-time loss on a daily deal, if we had a chance of converting the customers into regular diners. However, we have found that most people who purchase these deals, simply move on to the next deal after they are done.<p>2) Cheapens the product - Once you have lowered the price for a product, in this case food, the guest automatically ties the value of that product back to the price they paid. This is a huge problem for restaurants in particular because the guest is not willing to pay full price for the product even if they liked it. Now your product is valued at half of your current price, and to get that customer back in the door, you have to offer a significant discount again (most likely another daily deal).<p>3) Cannibalizes our existing customer base - One of the worst unintended consequences of using daily deals is that some of your regular guests start waiting for these deals, and only come in when they are available. This hurts in two ways: 1) regular guests are now spending less than they were the last time they came in, 2) regular guests are now waiting for a LivingSocial/Groupon deal to become available before returning to the restaurant causing them to wait longer before returning to the restaurant.<p>I believe that a company that provides customer acquisition via deals could be extremely valuable, but they must do it properly, and most importantly it must benefit their customer (in this case the restaurant). Until a company learns how to ensure that a business is obtaining a profit from providing this massive discount, without cheapening the product, and cannibalizing existing sales, the daily deals industry will continue to fall by the wayside.",1361427413

All of the other parts that a ancillary is done by this specialized company. What this could mean is that instead of working for someone, everyone works for themselves, and all the organizing happens via some automated fashion (akin to how the stock market operates).<p>Also what this means is that if the efficiency of the system is can be made high, then mediocrity will quickly die out (due to natural selection).",1361427350

5255778,comment,5255362,5255362,200,0,confluence,,,"Here are a few tips for others startup employees:<p>1. Take the least amount of stock possible - your startup is statistically unlikely to succeed. It'd be better to bump your salary up $10-20K than to get the stock.<p>2. Unless it's liquid - it's worthless.<p>3. Valuations pre-cashflow - are useless. Anybody can value anything at insane levels using just one dollar. I value HN at $1 billion by offering to buy only 1 share of 1 billion in common stock for $1 right now. See the implicit valuation leverage. I took a dollar, then invented the billion.<p>4. If you work for a ""nasty"" startup - one which people can consider to be negative long term to one or more parties - expect eventual collapse or flat line growth (Zynga/Groupon).<p>5. Companies exist to make management, investors and founders rich - they hold the vast majority of the stock - and benefit greatly from path dependence and network effects. You on the other hand don't. Expect to be screwed at any time.<p>Think of it like this. Managers/founders of most companies are pretty dipshit - how is it that they can own so much more stock? Simple. Be there earlier! Akin to how old money works. Imagine if you were the first person to squat land near what has now become Manhattan. You'd easily be worth hundreds of millions. There is obviously some skill in researching, predicting, working and acquiring land that will soon appreciate in value. But it's not worth nearly that much. Path dependence, luck and network effects do that. See GFC boom and that dumbass cousin who made and almost certainly lost millions in housing to understand how this works out.<p>Startups really aren't that different to a speculative investment in a house during boom times. Once you understand this - a lot of things start to make a hell of a lot more sense.<p>6. PG says be relentlessly resourceful. That's useful. But even better is to be relentlessly cynical.<p>Free t-shirts? Just an easy way to drop your salary and indoctrinate you - scratch that - it's a god damn uniform - freedom be damned! Free food? You took a $30-$40K pay cut to take the damn job - the food isn't worth a tenth of that + you're now working during lunch hours! Free hardware? That's only $2-$4K.<p>Hackathons? That's just work during your free time - or if it's during work time, it's a startup product you should own, but don't. More days off? Aren't you already working 60+ hours a week today! Culture shit after work? That's just more indoctrination. Gym membership? Only $200-500 - peanuts! Flexible work hours? That just means work more, but do it at times that aren't 9-5. Parental leave? Big companies and Europe have had that for ages.<p>Oh, and that culture fit crap? That's just discrimination - rebranded! What? You don't like what other late 20s upper-class educated males like? Be gone heathen!<p>End advice.<p>Not saying big companies or government jobs are any better.

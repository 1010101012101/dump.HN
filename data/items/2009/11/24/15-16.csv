959419,story,,,4,6,haidut,"Ask HN: Comments on and help on improving our recommendation engine for news",,"Hi all,<p>A friend of mine and I built this news ranking service of sorts based on a ranking algorithm I came up while I was in grad school for CS. Recently I also developed a recommendation engine based on a modified Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Why modified? Well, as most of you know SVM are really binary classifiers and need to classes of training data - i.e. good/bad. interesting/boring, etc. So in the case of news, you have to ask the user to select both interesting articles and not interesting articles. There have been a number of studies done on the subject how asking the user to do both is soometimes too much of a burden. Ideally, the user should tracked implicitly and the model should account for the uncertainty that arises from lack of explicit ratings. So here is how it works. I created an account and seeded the system with some articles that seem to have been popular on HN and the results are available. Just go to http://www.euraeka.com and click login on the top right. The user name is hackers (at) are (dot) us, and you can email me at haidut (at) gmail (dot) com for the password. Since the system already generated recommendations, you will see them right when you login. If a user likes an article they just click on it and the system records that. There is also a ""remove"" button next to each article in case the user knows up front they don't like that article and want it removed from view and recorded as uninteresting. The purpose of the remove option is also if you clicked on an article that you thought you will like but it turned out to be not interesting, so you have the option of reversing your initial decision and telling the system that the article was not good. Like I said above, ""removing"" an article is optional. The system can work if the user only clicks on articles that he/she likes and ignores the rest. \nNote: Obviously, I couldn't seed the system with every article that has been on HN. I just picked some that I liked before from topics such as science, entrepreneurship, health, etc. Feel free to seed the system even more. How to do that? Basically, once you are logged in either use the search box at the top to search for keywords of interest, or use the topics section at the right of the screen to find more specific news. If you find anything you like just click on the article.\nNote: Obviously, if you create your own account you will be able to test your own set of recommendations. Recommendations are generated every 24 hours using ALL the news collected in the last 24 hours.\nIf any of you have used the Google News or Digg recommendaton engines, I'd very interested to hear how this stacks up against those to services, given the fact that they are both based on user-to-user recommendation techniques (i.e. articles are recommended to you based on similarity to other users) rather than content-based recommendations (which is what Euraeka is).<p>Thanks in advance.",1259078024

The .com bubble was Wall Street paying off a handful of us for the opportunity to skim fees off of the irrational investment of the world's money (same as any financial bubble).  Other successful sectors have often taken funding that will ultimately send the returns back to Wall Street.<p>- Relatedly, successful public companies are bad for society.  They are always bound to delivering the greatest possible profit, and rarely held to any standards of ethical behavior.  The best you can do for society is to create a successful non-profit.<p>- There is no solid evidence that 9/11 happened like we are told.  Any discussion around this fact devolves to name calling and ridicule.<p>- People who join the (US) military are making the world a more dangerous place.  We have no natural enemies; they are creating a solution looking for a problem.<p>- Ad sponsored media's primary function is to force you to pay attention.  They trend towards accomplishing this with fear and social exploitation (shiny, sexy things) because these play to your un-ignorable biological reflexes.  Google has so far avoided much of this, but those ads are getting bigger and flashier...<p>- And most amazingly: it is okay to be wrong.

For example when a sorting algorithm is presented, typically we assume that items are just integers.<p>So if the database itself is huge, one would take a column and feed that into the quantum computer along with a matching function and a search item and the output would be the position of the item in the column.<p>In general it is assumed that 'items' are integers. That is general enough. But since no practical implementations exist, still we still don't know how it would work in the real world with a real database.<p>Here is a more in depth (and somewhat dramatic) explanation:<p>For N, items to be search,  it would take log2(N) qubits (that's enough to represent all N states).  The matching function would have to be a quantum gate/operator.  In other words, matching is performed in the quantum world.<p>The idea behind quantum algorithms is to encode the input in a set of qubits, then make them interact in a way that creates a superposition of states. A superposition of states can be thought of as sending the input into a 'magic' quantum world, where N qubits simoultaneously represent all 2^N binary states. Then a set of quantum operators (gates) are applied to the state vector, while it is still in this magic quantum world.<p>All is fine and dandy (provided that we can mentain the whole quantum world in a stable/isolated state).  Then the 'sad' part is that once we measure the result and bring it into the 'real' world, the whole 'magic' quantum world collapses on itself, and only one particular state out of 2^N emerges.<p>The trick is then to apply the quantum operators such that the probability of the quantum world collapsing to one particular 2^N state is increased.  In case of Grover's algorithm that is what happens. The quantum operators increase the probability of the quantum state collapsing to the matched index. It is a probabilistic algorithm in the sense that it might have to be run a couple of times.<p>EDIT: removed stupid spelling errors",1259075090

The strength/weight ratio is inversely proportional to the square of body size.

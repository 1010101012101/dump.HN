If anything, designers should probably be given <i>less</i> slack over time for their personality flaws, because their whole job revolves around communication and empathy toward a user.<p>Why not reflect that same empathy inward toward the company? If your design team is the center of your empathy toward your users, your design team should equally be trying to lead positive communication efforts with engineers and PMs to find a common ground, build a common vocabulary, and understand everyone&#x27;s stake in the game from the onset in a diplomatic and friendly fashion, especially so as the designer becomes senior. After all, what problem is more abstract than the meta-problem of intergroup communication?<p>I don&#x27;t think posts like this help construct meaningful dialogue between departments and only serve to reinforce existing clique-oriented behavior. Interdepartmental/inter-role communication is &quot;us vs. them&quot; only if these types of attitudes are allowed to foster in the corporate culture.",1376607592

It&#x27;s definitely a nice improvement, and makes code easier to understand (and allows for better exception handling), but it&#x27;s not actually changing the way your program is fundamentally structured.<p>And finally, &quot;await&quot; is only applicable when a single callback gets called once at the end. If you&#x27;re passing a callback that gets used repeatedly (a sorting function, for example), then normal-style callbacks are still necessary, and not harmful at all. Sometimes they can be short lambdas, sometimes they&#x27;re necessarily much larger.<p>In sum: &quot;await&quot; is great, but there&#x27;s nothing inherently harmful about callbacks, the way &quot;goto&quot; is. To the contrary -- callbacks are amazingly useful, and amazingly powerful in languages like JavaScript. &quot;Await&quot; just makes them nicer.",1376606915

You&#x27;re going to get some ice cream, these are the flavours we have, these are the flavours you like, and this is the price of one scoop. The sales person doesn&#x27;t have to explain to you why you should buy ice cream, which is why these &quot;sales conversations&quot; boil down to &quot;I want one scoop chocholate and one scoop lemon&quot;.<p>Odds are that you can do that in your SaaS business to. Of course, what you&#x27;re selling isn&#x27;t commoditized like ice cream. You&#x27;ll need to do some explaining, and there are things that will come up again and again.

That way, all questions about the merit of ice cream, the price of ice cream, aso. are out of the way, and the sales conversation is stripped down to &quot;So what kind of ice cream?

Why does the server&#x27;s web service API care if the client is HTML5 or not?<p>Yes, it is very reasonable.<p>The server doesn&#x27;t, but google does. The HTML5 requirement means that google can change everything about their service (e.g. they can switch the ads from being h264 videos today, to javascript games tomorrow, to 3d interactive items the next day when 3d screens become the norm on phones). If they had to expose an &quot;ad inventory API&quot;, they couldn&#x27;t change these things without breaking older clients.<p>An analogy: Microsoft relies on the TCP packets coming from YouTube being always 100 bytes or less (because they are). Google says &quot;no, you must use a general TCP stack, because one day we might want to make our packets longer&quot;. Microsoft dedicates significant engineering resources to examine the possibility, and at the end of the day recognizes that even though they have a general purpose TCP stack, switching to it will result in some inconvenience to users. So they release an app that has a TCP stack that expects 100 bytes or less -- and google refuses to serve it.<p>This is <i>exactly</i> the same, except at a higher abstraction level.

Google asked us to transition our app to a new coding language  HTML5. This was an odd request since neither YouTubes iPhone app nor its Android app are built on HTML5. Nevertheless, we dedicated significant engineering resources to examine the possibility. At the end of the day, experts from both companies recognized that building a YouTube app based on HTML5 would be technically difficult and time consuming, which is why we assume YouTube has not yet made the conversion for its iPhone and Android apps.<p>Google&#x27;s statement is totally mum on the matter except for &quot;it violates terms of use&quot;.

To me it means to provide an API on an equal footing among the various platforms.<p>To most of the world, it means &quot;you can interoperate with me as long as follow my terms and conditions&quot;, with those terms being considered reasonable. it does NOT mean &quot;I must let everyone compete with me on equal footing&quot;.",1376604080

Karma carries over from sub-reddit to sub-reddit and people obsess over it.  In my opinion, this is the &#x27;drug&#x27; that keeps people around.<p>Craigslist on the other hand has no karma.  A good seller or good buyer is completely anonymous.  People will post to Craigslist if they can sell just as easily they&#x27;ll post to another site if they  can sell there.  Reddit is not the same.  A redditor will more readily post to reddit because of the sweet, sweet karma.",1376604078

Literature ought to be a popularity contest!<p>I think I've read over half of the volumes mentioned there, and disliked a lot of them. I thought ""The Grapes of Wrath"" was awful, and never did figure out why anybody was ever impressed by ""The Catcher In The Rye"". To me, both of those were good examples of books that people read because other people read them, and nobody can really describe why they're so profound, but since everybody else has read them, they must be. And, among all these ""profound"" works, they included ""Into Thin Air"". I enjoyed it, and I used to be a climber, but what's it doing on that list?<p>Then, there are the many titles not found on the list. How about ""The Decameron"", for one? ""Pale Blue Dot""? ""A Brief History of Time""? ""Cosmos""? ""The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam""?<p>And, I'd argue that reading should be done as much for enjoyment as for edification. So, why not some ""Calvin and Hobbes""? Or ""Words I Wish I Wrote""? Or some Neil Gaiman or Greg Bear or George RR Martin?<p>I'm not ranting at you; I agree with you 100%. Your comment just seemed like an appropriate place to attach a rant against the article. :-)",1210934795
191652,comment,191263,191508,0,0,dazzawazza,,,"I think they make a reference to the sexualisation of children through the agressive marketing they refer to. It is because we allow children to act as a herd, directionless and meaningless that they are vulnerable to these powerful marketing techniques. Adults to not allow children to operate in the adult world in any meaningful way so marketing people have filled the vacuum with, well, a vacuum, but a vacuum that they can make money from.",1210934611

191646,comment,191263,191588,0,0,dazzawazza,,,"I think the factory system referes not to the subjects but the methods of teaching. It has been argued for the last 40 years or so that modern education just creates humans to work in cubicles since that is what employers want. This does  not benifit society.<p>An example in the UK is that all TEN year olds in the UK are taught to use Excel, Power Point and Word. They are not taught what these tools are for or how they work but how to use them. It has no educational value but gets the children ready for their working life of complete boredom. It is a complete waste of time in my opinion.<p>Example 2: All UK children from 9 are given lessons and tests in using a calculator. This can be inspite of the fact that they may not 'understand' multiplication (note I mean understand as opposed to perform).<p>Children are taught that education is needed so that you can get a good job (in a cubicle). While this is true it is a small part of the world as any adult knows. The idea of life learning is absent from modern education. Little or no attempt is made by the system to inspire children to go  beyond the syllabus, children who fall behind are however 'worked' until they catch up.<p>BTW I do not blame teachers for this. As education has become more prescriptive and motivational the role of teaching has been sidelined.<p>It's a good article and as a parent it rings true to me.<p>PS: I have two children aged 10 and 3 in the UK education system atm.",1210934359

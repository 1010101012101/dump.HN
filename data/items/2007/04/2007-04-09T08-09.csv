Much like reddit, users are afforded the opportunity to vote reviews up or down, giving more useful reviews more weight and reviews of less value a smaller amount of weight.  Eventually users will build karma and legitimize their opinion throughout the community.",1176108769

10712,comment,363,363,0,0,BrandonM,,,"A way to view comments to a submission by the time they were posted, preferably as some kind of toggled option at the top of the page.  One use case is clearly in this thread, where finding new feature requests can be very difficult.  Another is just keeping up on the comments to my submissions; once a submissions comment thread gets substantially long, it can be difficult to keep up on reading the new comments.<p>I think the ideal way to reorder would be to consider a comment's post time to be that of its most recent child.  This means that when someone replies to a thread, the entire thread will now be the first on the page, with each sublevel ordered in the same manner.  Of course, I knew reply to the submission itself would show up at the very top.<p>This functionality could be extended to the threads page (which relates to a suggestion I made a little while ago) and even to the Startup News page itself, so that we could see which submission has been commented on most recently (because as a parent, its child would have the most recent reply).",1176108319

10710,comment,10676,10676,0,0,mukund,,,"Product reviews help common people lookup and see what are advantages and short comings of the product. But i have seen quite a lot of them biased. One such example being movie reviews, its alll hyped and tampered with. Be it movies or products/services, that kind of trust and credibility is need of the hour. There is no guarantee to see and find out if its being rigged. So a better model will be to allow reviews with good and bad points. Allow users to speak up with proof if good features are indeed hyped or to provide a proof which shows its indeed bad feature. As proper proofs come into play, there may be clearcut credibility in the process ",1176107832
10709,comment,363,381,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I agree with this suggestion, but for another reason.  There have been a few times when I'm writing a reply and I stop to think for a moment.  Occasionally, during this pause, I will glance up and notice that I haven't voted the article up yet.  Unfortunately, when I do vote the article up, everything I have written up to that point gets cleared.  I have tried pressing the back button, but it tends to take me back to where I was before I started writing my comment.<p>I understand that this is an error on my part, but that doesn't alter how frustrating it can be.",1176107799
10708,comment,10676,10676,0,0,mauricecheeks,,,":-) I'm glad this got posted on here. We are building a product review site & I was super tempted to leave a comment on techcrunch. Alas, our site isn't far enough along, nor is it prepared for that kind of attention. <p>PowerReviews/buzzillions has a pretty clever business model. Essentially its creating Sheep that $hit grass. It is a step beyond it's competition iNods, which is two steps beyond ViewScore, which are both only marginally more useful than just searching google to find reviews.<p>But what I (we) think would be a lot cooler, is building a community around and for this tech consumer market. <p>Our site ( <a href=""http://revvu.com"">http://revvu.com</a> ) uses a user-driven model for centralizing consumer electronic reviews on the web. Users can submit reviews that they find, or blog, or want to share. Then the community can vote reviews up or down (based on value) per each individual product page. (sort of reddit style)<p>Votes on reviews effect the weight of ratings, forming a dynamic review score that reflects the opinion of the masses. <p>We just launched on Monday, so karma is not yet visible. Also, our social network aspect is not in place yet. That aspect will be the key to creating a strong community, creating an addicting user experience, and creating a way to share (read: show off) the things you own & are interested in. <p>I think PowerReviews is a cool concept, and will probably work for some retailers... but they (like everyone else in this space) don't get ""it"" yet. Aside from the arbitrary use of tagging, their site isn't really reflecting any of the advancements or evolutions of the way people use the internet today. They have found a business model that seems feasible and built an idea around it in a market that NEEDS improvement. What they lack is a carrot to attract users (those seeking reviews) to care, return, or get involved. Which might be fine for them, if thats not what they want. If thats the case though, suggesting that PowerReview (or buzzillions) ""may get the market"" doesn't sound very likely.<p>Anyway, we'd really appreciate feedback on our site.  This is a very sharp community. We would certainly be interested to hear from, or chat with, anyone who has feedback/suggestions for us. ",1176107730
10706,comment,363,363,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I would like to see a convenient way to see my upvoted comments (in order of most recently received upvotes).  The motivation is this: after seeing that my karma has gone up, I'm curious which of my comments was deemed interesting.  Currently, I have to scroll down the threads page until I notice one that looks higher than I remember.  This is so clearly inefficient and error-prone that I think a software solution is necessary.<p>This is not completely motivated by narcissism :).  I feel that by noting which of my comments are appreciated, I can see which aspects of my writing styles and my thinking are found to be interesting by others.",1176107573
10705,comment,2760,4062,0,0,henryw,,,"An update on the book. I'm almost done reading it, and I would like to say that it's a really amusing book (not the Anthony Robbins type). Some take aways (I'm not saying I agree with them all. I could agree, but I'm just saying I'm not saying that.): <p>1) You gotta really really want to make money, more than you want to be happy if needs be. Be compulsively determined.<p>2) Don't try to cheat the IRS.<p>3) Delegate. Hire smarter people than you, and pay them very well, but keep ownership.<p>4) Get rich. Give it away.<p>5) Timing is very important, more than talent?<p>6) Execution is more important than the idea. Just go do it.<p>7) Self-belief is priceless. Confront doubts for facts.<p>8) Time is the most important thing.",1176107491

10701,comment,10456,10457,0,0,henryw,,,"I was going to say that the answer is easy. But after thinking, typing, and backspacing, I think that the final code will probably be some really really good code because it would have been improved upon so many times. This is based on the assumption that all programmers are about equally good. Otherwise everyone will be using the one best coder's code, with some slight improvements maybe.<p>Figuring out who gets paid what might be really complicated.",1176106530
10700,comment,10460,10525,0,0,celoyd,,,"I'm a little overweight too, but I think it's because I eat too much, not because I eat junk. And, at the risk of mapping ""hackers and Xers"" over every X in sight, I think jward is right: cooking feels noticeably like coding.<p>Maybe I'm just from Mars (i.e., not suburbia) again, but from what I've seen most parents who can afford to let their kids be nerds also teach them what a kitchen is for. This can be as passive as not making breakfast when they wake up at three on a summer afternoon. My mom never sat me down and said ""this is how you make an omelette"" or whatever, but she made the information available and I learned it because it was useful.<p>It's not that people who can't cook must have bad parents, it's just that when you see lot of them in one place you start wondering why.

This way everything is easy to split up, just change the IP from ""127.0.0.1"" to your new database server, etc.<p>Also stuff like not storing sessions locally (put them in DB) makes it easy to scale out to multiple web servers.<p>With some decent memory (1GB+) even a single processor server is plenty to run a sizable site.

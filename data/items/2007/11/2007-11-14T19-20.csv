But tech has to be grown everywhere - there are VC's everywhere, angels everywhere, talent everywhere.  It still takes the right people with the right progression of ideas...anywhere.

But in reality, analysts say widget makers are not only creating innovative, user-friendly products, they're also making a bunch of money--real money--from ads.""<p>
Let's see, 7000 applications for FaceBook, and over 100 are added each day? I'll just pull a number out of the air and say that only the top 100 or so are profitable to some interesting degree (and if I remember correctly, that's being generous.) Assuming all applications are equal, that's like a 1-in-70 chance of making money. And even if you do kick-off a hugely successful application inside of FaceBook, the goal is what? That you've got a great solution to users and can now spread to other solution areas? Or that you're just another reason for users to use FaceBook?<p>

It is rock solid, except trying to get a recent version of python is a royal pain (python 2.3 comes installed, you have to wrangle a bit with pkgsrc to get python 2.4..). <p>If you use python, and don't mind burning hours trying to just get your environment up, but really want solaris and their nas storage (which is really nice), this is a good option. However, there are alot of really cheap ubuntu/xen based vps's out there that are Really affordable and ready to take on your application in its early days. From experience i would recommend that for python developers.",1195068747

It runs perfectly in other browsers - in fact it often runs faster than non-asm.js compiled code, so it is worthwhile even without new optimizations for it.<p>It is also, in addition, optimizable like a low-level VM.<p>> Maybe on the web we'll get NaCL to serve the same purpose.<p>asm.js, by design, can have pretty much the same level of performance as NaCl. Both can use the same sandboxing mechanisms, for example. Unless there is something specific in the asm.js spec you feel is preventing some additional level of optimization that is possible in NaCl - if so, what?",1362859185

Surely if Destructoid are seeing a 50% block rate, their competitors must be seeing something similar too?  A world with ad-blockers is the new normal for everyone.<p>Ad-blockers aren't going away.  The fundamental architecture of the internet and the web makes it almost impossible to <i>force</i> people to view ads that they don't want to, and no advertiser is going to win the technological arms-race against the ad-blocking software.  For now, at least, I have sufficient control over my own computer that I can dictate what appears on the screen.<p>I think the right conclusions are reached in this article though.  Destructoid clearly understand the marketplace they're operating in, and a membership option of some kind is a good, non-exploitative way of earning money from content creation.  It might not work, and there might be better alternatives, but someone is going to find a way that does work.  The existence of ad blockers is providing ""evolutionary"" pressure toward business models that don't rely on spamming people with crap, and this is a good thing.  (Assuming, that is, that the new business models aren't somehow worse, at which point we'll have to start blocking those...)",1362859165

1: focus on helping readers read content. Eliminate everything that gets in the way if that. (End user needs)
2: reduce the volume and spammiess of your ads, in all markets. (Quality of advertising reflects quality of site)
3: do a slashdot, and add a paid subscription that removes all advertising for a period. (Allow people to give you money).

5349418,comment,5348513,5348804,1,0,vor_,,,"I find Lua's use of tables as a universal container to be clumsy. For example:<p><pre><code>  local array = { one, two, threee, four }
</code></pre>
A gap is silently created in the array because Lua returns nil for undefined variables. This causes the (#) operator to an return incorrect result and can lead to subtle, difficult-to-find bugs in the program.<p>Lua makes no distinction between nil and a non-existent element, so assigning nil to an array element will also create a gap, rather than shifting the keys of the subsequent elements downward:<p><pre><code>  local array = { 1, 2, 3, 4 }
  array[2] = nil
  -- array is now { [1] = 1, [3] = 3, [4] = 4 }</code></pre>",1362859073

It's as if he spins around and says that the best whist players and bricklayers must be propelled by an unhealthy greed or pride, seeing as it's impossible to write a book on such mystical things.<p>We recognize today that money is not moral or immoral,

You're not locked into anything (well, most things) in your life. True, some things are harder to shed than others, but if you're depressed enough where it affects you on a monumental, daily basis, just remember you can change it. Stop engaging in activities that make you feel like shit. Cut acquaintances (even family) out of your life that bring you down.

I intentionally left out alternatives because there is no one size fits all model, but there are plenty of options.

Look for ways to make the link between someone reading your content and someone buying something a connection, instead of merely a random, uncorrelated activity. For artistic content sites, sell swag like t-shirts. Or consider selling byproducts and content collections such as physical and ebooks (for blogs, for example). If you run a site that provides a service ... consider charging money for that service.

Many people seem to continue studying out of inertia and through encouragement of academics who have a vested interest in maintaining a large number of graduate students.<p>I'd suggest they take their undergraduate degree and go test the waters of where they think they want to work. Spend a couple of years in the field, even at a lower level, pay off a little of the debt they already have, and then if they like the field, and want to continue in it, they'll have a much clearer idea of the benefit/cost ratio of an advanced degree, and a better idea of which school and program will give them the best value. And if they decide the whole field is wrong for them, it's much easier to start afresh somewhere else. Undergraduate degrees are much more transferable from field-to-field than advanced degrees.",1362858146

It also has inconsistent boolean expression evaluation:<p><pre><code>  while 0 do print(""Loops forever"") end
  while not 1 do print(""Does nothing"") end
  while 1 do print(""Loops forever"") end
  while not 0 do print(""Does nothing"") end
</code></pre>
It's nice having real classes in Squirrel with type introspection and corresponding C APIs. In Lua, I have to juggle metatables in the registry to construct a class system, and my system will differ slightly from someone else's. Squirrel's other niceties like compile-time constants, 0-based arrays, and automatic reference counting for predictable memory management overhead make it a quite nice alternative to Lua.<p>It sounds like I'm bashing Lua here, though I still find it fun to program occasionally. But I do wonder how long Lua can remain as popular as it is with an unconventional syntax, inconsistent behavior, and a minimal built-in library in the face of richer alternatives like Squirrel, mruby, and even Tcl, which has improved much in recent years. There must have been a reason Valve Software chose to use Squirrel in L4D2 and Portal 2 instead of using Lua as most apparently do.",1362857993

It has never been true that the Supreme Court is the appropriate forum for redress of every possible Constitutional violation. That is to say, it can be simultaneously true that the Executive does something unconstitutional and that it is appropriate for the Supreme Court not to review the action.<p>The conduct of war is an area in which the Constitution invests the President with primacy. But it's not a black/white issue--it's a spectrum. The more closely a matter touches U.S. soil, the more justification the Supreme Court has for intervening. At one end of the spectrum is the President's conduct with respect to foreigners on foreign soil. The Supreme Court has no business telling the President how to kill Taliban in Afghanistan. At the other end of the spectrum is the President's conduct with respect to Americans on American soil. The Supreme Court must insert itself in such situations, as it did in Hamdi v.

The Supreme Court is quite prudent not to take up that hairy situation, especially since civil libertarians may very well not like the answer.[1]<p>[1] It wouldn't be unreasonable or unjustifiable for the Supreme Court to say that U.S. Citizens do retain the right to due process while off U.S. soil, even if they take up arms against the U.S., but that an administrative process is sufficient ""process due"" in situations where the Citizen refuses to submit himself to judicial process.",1362856939

You don't notice this much in C and derived languages because the for loop in those languages is more flexible (and more open to abuse).<p>More concretely, this is a very common idiom in Delphi when dealing with 0-based containers:<p><pre><code>    for i := 0 to list.Count - 1 do

The '- 1' on the end is ugly. What's needed is a way of expressing a half-closed interval, but that's not common in programming languages (despite it being a great aid to correctly expressing many algorithms concisely).<p>Let's say you want to insert into the middle of an array, at x, with count elements (and presumed free space at the end). You need to move all the elements from x to the end up one. Let's suppose you have a move(array, fromIndex, toIndex, count) function that can do that. In 0-based languages:<p><pre><code>    move(array, x, x + 1, count - x)
</code></pre>
But you need to adjust it for 1-based languages:<p><pre><code>    move(array, x, x + 1, count - x + 1)

However, you can mitigate it by changing how the move() function takes its parameters:<p><pre><code>    move(array, startIndex, endIndex, newIndex)
    move(array, x, count, x + 1)

If everyone is consistent, and APIs are designed with 1-based indexing in mind, most of the issues go away. It's when there are mixed styles that things get painful.",1362856749

No way out or through, no light at the end of the tunnel, just trapped in a particular emotional state and perception of things.  No way forward in life.<p>One of the best ways to help people through that is for those who have been through it to simply share, in detail, their own experience with it, how and why they felt trapped at the time, and how they made it through, and what ultimately solved it for them.<p>Simply demonstrate the possibility, with as much concrete detail as possible (which hackers particularly require), that there is a way through (a hack, even), that depression grossly skews your perspective of the world, and things are not as bad as they appear (especially for anyone living in a first world country and among the lucky few fluent in the empowering languages of technology).<p>Other options would be physically changing people's perspective by organizing some sort of multi-month aid mission to an impoverished country (maybe hook up with Engineers or Doctors Without Borders).  Or alternatively a grueling, endorphin-generating Outward Bound type excursion.  Anything to jolt people out of their current perspective of their relatively limited existence.<p>Finally, if it helps you could treat this whole idea as a startup, solving the particular problem of hacker depression.  Use lean startup methodology, your hacker problem solving skills and mentality, look for hacks nobody has found yet.  Document and blog it all, etc.  Who knows where it might lead, but there's certainly an awareness of the problem thanks to high profile hacker suicides lately, and lots of people probably willing to help.",1362856524

5349252,comment,5348323,5348323,8,0,angersock,,,"Two stories regarding coding standards.<p>~<p>At my old day job (sprawling planet-eating Java), the codebase had gone through many hands over the course of ten or so years. The ""age"" of some code or feature could usually be determined by looking at how it was written: newest code used the Java foreach construct, older code (usually by one particular developer) used explicit for constructs, and the oldest code reimplemented (poorly) collection classes without generics.<p>Additionally, the fist (coding style) of each person who'd worked on a section became apparent: my own code tended to have a large number of anonymous inner classes and monkey closures, as well as somewhat heavy use of interface and abstract classes. Another coder liked static factory methods a lot, as well as very shallow inheritance hierarchies (in order to make debugging simpler). The oldest code was the poster child for 90s Java: EnterpriseFactoryProxyFacadeAdaptorSingletonProviders, overly wordy code to accomplish simple tasks, etc.<p>It was interesting to open a file or function to implement a feature or bugfix and then twitch when you realized that it was from one of the more...time-pressed...veteran... developers. By contrast, opening code in a particular style (indenting, commenting, etc.) I recognized as my own or another coworker brought relief.<p>~<p>At the same time I was working on this, I worked on a large library with some friends doing gamedev. We agreed on a coding standard, had some rather arcane arguments, and ultimately settled on something that drew heavy inspiration from Insomniac's coding guide--not exactly alike, but we at least had an opinion on nearly everything they cover.<p>Whenever working on that code, I have a very different feeling. Despite the fact that we're all working on it at the same time, and despite the fact that we all have some remnants of our fists, the codebase still feels fairly uniform and like home.<p>Variable naming is basically the same, choice of verbs and methods is the same, indentation is nearly the same (as are the cases where liberties are taken), commenting is consistent where it matters (fists show through in individual writing styles, but documentation for interfaces and function signatures is standardized), and overall there is a high amount of consistency.<p>Even deeper, the amount of cleverness is roughly equivalent throughout the code--as we use C++, this cannot be undersold. We've come to a consensus on when and how to use templates, and in what ways, and when to use defines, and how we treat inheritance and interfaces and abstractions. We have house rules on how things should behave; in a language where you can overload and redefine operators, restraint is important.<p>~<p>Overall, having a common coding standard--and moreover, one that everyone has closely examined and discussed and agreed on--really helps decrease cognitive load. It gives better ""faith"" in your codebase, and reduces the annoyance of working on somebody else's code. It reduces the impedance mismatch of abstractions as they work together, and helps to reassure you when its three in the goddamn morning and why the christ am i getting these compiler warnings sheezus didnt anybody read through this before committing argh at least we have unit tests.<p>It's also something a lot of people seem to dismiss as bike-shedding, and sometimes it can seem like that. It's at least worth considering, especially if you work with people you care about--coding on a team should be like a relationship, and any successful relationship involves developing a common background and shorthand for communicating.",1362855918

5349233,comment,5337525,5342854,1,0,toasterlovin,,,"For me, mousing has been consistently and terribly painful. I bought a right-handed Evoluent mouse (I am right handed) and it worked wonders, until a period of particularly intense mousing, at which point I bought a left-handed model.<p>Now, I primarily use the left-handed Evoluent mouse. During periods of intense mousing, if I start to feel pain, I'll switch to the right-handed Evoluent mouse for a week or two.<p>You mentioned wanting a mouse which put your hand at an angle in between a standard mouse (horizontal) and the Evoluent mouse (vertical). Is there a particular reason for this?<p>I ask because I've found the Evoluent to be incredibly comfortable. Besides which, a vertical orientation most closely emulates the position your hands would be in when you are anatomically at rest (standing, with your hands hanging down at your sides).<p>As much as I love the Evoluent mouse, I still feel that eliminating mousing from my computer use is the Right Way to address mouse related pain. Treat the root cause, not the symptoms, as they say.<p>I basically use keyboard shortcuts for everything. The two parts of using a computer which I found most difficult to control with a keyboard were web browsing and window resizing / management.<p>For web browsing I stumbled upon Chrome + the Vimium extension. It has non-chording key bindings for switching tabs, moving around on the page, following links, copying (yanking) text, etc. Basically, Vimium adds Vim-like keybindings to many common browser tasks. Find it here: <a href=""http://vimium.github.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimium.github.com/</a><p>For window resizing and management, I use Moom (it's a Mac application). It is fantastic. You can setup key bindings to resize a window to a preset dimension, among other things; but that's what I use it for primarily. I have 3 key bindings that I use all the time: 1) full screen, 2) two thirds on the left side of the screen, and 3) one third on the right hand side of the screen. Moom is here: <a href=""http://manytricks.com/moom/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://manytricks.com/moom/</a><p>I've also become aware of Slate for window management on the Mac, which looks amazing, but is a tool of the large investment / large payoff sort, and I just haven't had much free time lately.

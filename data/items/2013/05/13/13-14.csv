Over the past several years John has worked with a broad variety of start-ups in the early-to-mid development stage on both sides of the Atlantic. He's come away with a great understanding of the challenges start-up founders face leading up to launch.<p>I regularly turn to him for advice on engineering management. I'll definitely be buying this book.<p>(For the record, John didn't ask me to write this nor did he know I was going to.)",1368453585

5698650,comment,5695766,5696356,1,0,taeric,,,"But see, here is the thing.  I was not arguing for modes, per se.  I was definitely not arguing for vim.  Just had to acknowledge that I use it.<p>I do think that quote is taking great liberties.  The best user interfaces came with mentors.  I would go so far as to argue that vim sucked for me, as I did not have anyone to ask for help.  Indeed, I was a heavy eclipse/idea/various other user for a good 8 years before I really got into vim.  Probably the only reason I did so was because I was a remote worker for a while with a connection too slow for any graphical forwarding.  Then, eclipse went through a garbage period where it was too slow or just crashed a lot.  (My understanding is that it has improved, greatly.)<p>But, back to my argument.  Modes are bloody everywhere.  Want the car to go forward, put it in the correct mode for the accelerator to cause that to happen.  Backwards?  Similar.  (And no, I'm not even talking about a manual transmission.)<p>Consider cooking.  Want to make an omelette?  Well, start by heating the pan.  Depending on the cooktop you have and the pan you have, this will take a differing amount of time.  Then, add the ingredients.  Make sure to add enough, but not too much, salt.  Want to know how much is too much?  Well, practice.  Experiment.  There is absolutely no indicator for this.<p>Moving over to writing.  Make sure you are holding the pen/pencil the correct way.  And on the correct surface.  (Anyone that thinks these are obvious things hasn't had to teach kids to draw on a piece of paper.)  (This goes back to my ""mentor"" idea.)<p>Now, move on over to music for a minute.  What do you mean the instrument has to be in tune?  And you typically have to use both hands?  Often with a foot pedal?  Clearly humanity should have given up on that endeaver years ago.<p>(Do I need to even discuss sports?)<p>Which brings me to what I think is my point.  Modes are something that adds difficulty, for sure.  But life is not about making all things easier.  For many, that challenge can help add appreciation to what they accomplish.  The goal is not to eliminate modes, but to make sure users can accomplish what they want.  Mainly by addressing the majority case, not the fringe ones.<p>""Changing the bass"" setting of your car stereo is something 99.999% of the populace doesn't give a crap about.  It is not that they wish to have no way to do it, they just don't care.  Having the interface revert back to ""change the station"" after an interval of no use makes perfect sense in that regard.  Why not bitch that your phone will revert to a ""locked"" state after a period of no use?  You can argue that they just need a screen with more information on it, so they can change bass and station at the same time.  Yet, my hypothesis would be that that is exactly backwards.  Most people only want in front of them what they need to accomplish what they are doing.",1368453550

This is the real reason so many accounts get frozen with relation to donations, not quantity.<p>(That said, you should make it clear to your contributors that their ""donation"" is not a charitable contribution from a tax perspective, which many people might fail to realize if you use the word ""donate""; but, in my direct experience from getting my account temporarily limited, if you get dinged on this one it is easy enough to talk to PayPal, find out what happened, and get everything up again in a couple hours after working out better wording with them.)",1368453515

5698643,comment,5697912,5698042,3,0,felipec,,,"> ""Just stop"" sounds like a warning to me.<p>A warning of what? If a person on the street tells you to ""stop"", your first reaction would be to ask ""stop what?"", and the answer is ""stop chewing gum"", to which you reply ""but there's nothing wrong with chewing gum"", and then you are thrown to jail for all time.<p>You see what's wrong here, don't you? First of all a warning should convey the punishment; maybe a fine, maybe jail time, etc. Secondly, you can't assume that anybody that tells you to stop doing something is some kind of authority. In my case Olav never made it clear he had the power to ban me, nor that he was contemplating using it. Thirdly, saying ""there's nothing wrong with chewing gum"" is argumentation, it's not a second offence.<p>And yeah, surely Olav might have been annoyed by comments I made in other forums, but comments in other forums shouldn't be used as reasons for a ban <i>bugzilla</i>. I always provided value in bugzilla for years, and was banned for a couple of comments. Seems a bit unfair.<p>I know this is tedious, but these guys don't leave any alternative. I couldn't comment in bugzilla any more, I didn't receive an email notification, and nobody from bugmaster@gnome.org wanted to hear my case. What am I supposed to do?<p>If GNOME was handled properly, none of this would have happened.",1368453502

5698633,comment,5698510,5698510,67,0,michaelochurch,,,"As I get older and see what most of ""technology leadership"" is turning out to be, I'm unhappy with it.<p>I feel like a lot of technological new money behaves like women in gangs. How so? Well, many sociologists have found that women who join gangs are <i>more</i> prone to violence and cruelty than the men; they go overboard in ""proving themselves"" and miss the fact that gangs are mostly about business, not cruelty and machismo (which are necessary, at measured but sometimes severe levels, to protect an illegal business; but otherwise undesirable) for their own right. Why? Of course, it's not that women, across the board, are more that way. It has more to do with the small set of people who join criminal gangs, and the fact that the even smaller set of women who join end up getting into a try-too-hard pattern.<p>We see a lot of so-called ""technological leadership"" falling into historically-common new-money patterns of right-wing politics and bad workplace cultures (fast firing, closed allocation) because, instead of replacing the old elite, they become a caricature of what they were supposed to be pushing out.<p>On the whole, the resurgent right-wing business elite of the Welch era (1977-95) was worse than the politically centrist old-board northeastern elite it replaced. And it seems that the ""technology elite"", when they go into business proper (i.e. personnel matters, not merely new product development) and politics is even uglier than that one. They aren't right-wing because it's not ""cool"" to be conservative, but they're politically apathetic and can be played by more skillful operators in both parties.<p>So now I'm going to reveal the secret about ""technology leadership"". They aren't either. Mark Zuckerberg may be an exception; he's too young and too successful to have a refined skill at the judgment of character, so I'll give him a pass, because he seems to be a good guy in spite of his visible mistakes. But most of the people who have swept in and become the ""fundable"" (now MBAs with connections, who have outcompeted true technologists for VC and tech-press attention) don't really care about technology. They just heard that ""tech"" has a lot of people who (a) add a lot of value, but (b) are so deficient in social skills and negotiation that it's a cake-walk to take advantage of them. That attracts sociopaths into the upper reaches of ""our"" industry (no longer ours in any real way) who come in (always as boss-level implants) because they hear it's full of easy pickings and who stay because it turns out to be true.",1368453349

No. I worked my way through college and paid full tuition, and only got semi-sponsored housing because some friend told me that some monks actually did that if you made your case to them (essentialy you had to get and keep getting good grades. 80%+ good grades that is, a lot tougher than it sounds (average of class was < 50%), especially if you need a job to pay for tuition as well).

The pay they set, you ask ? $the_limit - 1 for example. (the same limit is used for free childcare, >50% reduction on health insurance, the list goes on ...).

In modern typed language like Haskell or Scala (and presumably also F#) it's very easy natural to build parsers that can move back and forth between string and text representations, and the APIs one uses are largely generic whether one is building XML, Javascript, SQL or something else. It's also natural to use ""tagged"" datatypes to statically enforce that user input is handled differently from internal strings (I understand perl has a ""taint"" module that does the same thing, but presumably it has to happen at runtime, and I'm not aware of similar functionality in Python or Ruby at all).<p>Try a statically typed language sometime - they're not all like Java.

Linux now runs much of the world and isn't really a novelty.<p>""If a question like 'which audio driver do i best install?' can only be answered by reading through a multi-year flamewar, why would I bother?""<p>Unless you have specialist needs it's not really a question that should pop up any more, your distro of choice ought to make that decision for you.<p>""Still, to me, 'end-user FOSS' and 'hate and anger' are somehow symbolically linked.""<p>Kinda. This is a bit different as it's not a war over ""A or B"" but the direction A is taking.<p>The problem, particularly with Gnome at present, is that the direction it's taking is not appreciated by most existing users. It's compounded by the fact that a lot of people liked Gnome 2, and the Gnome team basically canned that at short notice. Distributions then started to roll out Gnome 3 and remove Gnome 2. Gnome 3 forces them to work differently and takes away a lot of choice. So users were annoyed, the desktop environment they liked seemed to be being taken away from them and the new one seemed to be making a lot of stuff worse.<p>From the developers' perspective (as far as I can tell) the thought was basically that Gnome 2 was finished, stable, unexciting and old fashioned. A drive took place to create a new, modern desktop with a consistent experience. Logically then, this would bring new users to Linux. Some resistance from techies was to be expected, people don't like change, but they'll thank us for it in the end.<p>I'm not 100% sure why the distros ditched Gnome 2 quite so fast, but the announcement of support and development basically being dropped didn't help. The Gnome team also seem to have gone out of their way to make sure that the two could not easily reside on the same system.<p>Anyway, these three things in confluence make people feel like the Gnome team have taken something from them (not really true) and the Gnome team think that naysayers are all entitled and change resistant (also not really true). So it's no wonder it's a rather heated area.<p>If you want to watch FOSS at its constructive best I recommend the debian mailing lists. You'll still find disagreement on there, but you'll also see people helping each other and getting stuff done.<p>I think part of the reason for your perception is probably that FOSS is done far more out in the open than something like MS Windows, and in a far less hierarchical way, so there's nobody to pull rank or to hush things up. Linus may well be in charge of the kernel, but only has a limited say over the user space (for example).<p>(This has become quite a bit longer than it was meant to be!)<p>Also, I'd be interested to know if you think the vitriol between FOSS advocates is any worse than, say, all the Mac/Windows shouting matches you see all over the net? Or Ps3/Xbox weenies? (BTW if you really want to see FOSS vitriol go observe a GPL vs BSD license freedom debate!)<p>I think people on the net just like to argue. I know I do. Free/Open software is developed out in the open through mass collaboration, which gives so much wonderful, flamey opportunity.",1368452412

And then, amongst those that are, how many of them are tied to full blown news operations.<p>While I think the green dot/red dot controversy is overblown, the paranoia is driven by the ubiquitous aspect of the terminals combined with the massive number of workflows that are centralized on Bloomberg terminals. Here's a sampling:<p>* Proprietary email and IM systems integral to interactions with customers and counterparties\n* Trading systems in virtually every asset class. TOMS, the fixed income system, is the defacto standard for bonds.\n* One of the top financial news gathering organizations\n* Best-in-class financial data and analytics<p>So when you think of what someone could do with access to the system, it almost boggles the mind. Ability to know who is looking at what. Who is saying what to whom. And in certain asset classes, the best possible data on who is buying what. A rogue support person, for example, could do incredible damage to the company. Hopefully they have good mechanisms to control that - the fact that we haven't heard about it thus far is a good sign.<p>Given the overlap of workflows available on the terminals, plus the relatively low-cost of extra features once you're already paying for the terminal, makes me view Bloomberg as an anti-trust case waiting to happen. I wonder if they think so too - and to feed more paranoia, I've wondered whether that explains why Mayor Bloomberg is in politics.

If you looked at total sales of those three companies, they would crush Tesla. I'd imagine Audi is the lowest of the three and they probably sell as many A4's in one or two months as Tesla sells Model S's in a year.<p>But therein lies the huge growth potential for Tesla. I really doubted Tesla prior to the Model S and through the large investment they took during the bailout periods, but their strategy has proven solid and their execution near-flawless. By creating a high-end sedan, while focusing a lot of effort on making it an amazing car that happens to be electric, vs. appealing solely on its electric drivetrain, they've been able to focus on a market fully willing to take a risk on an unproven product.<p>Tesla's next challenge will be introducing electric cars to markets more adverse to risk and more sensitive to prices. The Chevy Volt is priced (before tax credits) closer to where the A4, Series 3,  and C-class are, but I don't think anyone would compare the driving experience of a Volt to one of those European sedans.",1368451840

BTW, events were prioritized by the OS, so not all events were treated equally.  Same with NT. So you'd think of your application as a state machine, with the transitions being driven by the OS events appearing.<p>Message Queueing (the current darling of the scalability crowd) has been around a lot longer than people realize.  :)<p>Also understand that for line-of-business applications, once the screen was done painting and you were waiting for user action, the event loop went into ""idle"" state. So in most cases you only had to worry about timeouts when you were communicating with a server (database or mainframe).",1368450220

A couple of updates later it's running like molasses despite lots of spare HD space and no random services eating RAM. The culprit is the Google services I can't uninstall and can't stop from connecting, that eat up RAM when reception is poor trying (and failing) to connect.<p>I wish they'd test their new OSs on old Nexus models at the very least, and why the hell can't I uninstall Google Currents..",1368450213

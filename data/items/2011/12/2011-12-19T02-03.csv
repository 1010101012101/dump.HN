The threshold was originally 5,000 signatures but was raised to 25,000 after the White House responded to pleas for information about extraterrestrials. If they gave a response to that arguably silly request, it is reasonable to think they will at least respond to this one.<p>See <a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45176460/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/white-house-theres-no-sign-et-or-ufo-cover-up/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45176460/ns/technology_and_scien...</a>",1324263485

3368254,comment,3367789,3368136,21,0,gwern,,,"> Not every sleeper is the same, of course: Dinges has found that some people who need eight hours will immediately feel the wallop of one four-hour night, while other eight-hour sleepers can handle several four-hour nights before their performance deteriorates. (But deteriorate it will.) There is a small portion of the population  he estimates it at around 5 percent or even less  who, for what researchers think may be genetic reasons, can maintain their performance with five or fewer hours of sleep. (There is also a small percentage who require 9 or 10 hours.)<p>Don't try this unless you've actually done some measuring and testing; overconfidence and biases are more common than tests:<p>> Still, while its tempting to believe we can train ourselves to be among the five-hour group  we cant, Dinges says  or that we are naturally those five-hour sleepers, consider a key finding from Van Dongen and Dingess study: after just a few days, the four- and six-hour group reported that, yes, they were slightly sleepy. But they insisted they had adjusted to their new state. Even 14 days into the study, they said sleepiness was not affecting them. In fact, their performance had tanked. In other words, the sleep-deprived among us are lousy judges of our own sleep needs. We are not nearly as sharp as we think we are.<p><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/magazine/mag-17Sleep-t.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/magazine/mag-17Sleep-t.ht...</a>",1324262891
3368253,comment,3367866,3367866,5,0,feralchimp,,,"This is clever, and I think it relates in a neat way to the current TLS trust imbalance between browsers and native clients.<p>When I write a native client app against my own server, I don't need to rely on traditional appeals to CA trust because I know exactly what certificate the server should be presenting to me.<p>TLS is weaker in browsers because arbitrary web clients don't know my server ahead of time, so they trust me if one of the Super Trustworthy Oracles trusts me.  But the list of those CAs is large enough, and updated slow enough, that the list is not particularly trustworthy in aggregate even when any individual CA may be considered trustworthy at a particular point in time.  So there's an issue there, even with a savvy user class who would reject access in response to a certificate warning.<p>The Sovereign Keys proposal strikes me as a way to let browsers 'phone a friend' who, in essence, knows exactly what certificate the server should be presenting.  It makes an arbitrary client more like my native client.<p>But I think there's a scalability concern about Sovereign Keys that's related to the problems we see with CAs today: When they become a popular commodity, how will the system deal with millions of websites asking for Sovereign Keys?  Will it really take the time to verify that the requestors are valid, or will it try to 'meet the demand' and sacrifice security in the process?  And when the system is fooled, as it occasionally will be, how quickly will revocations or replacements be operational?",1324262860

We pay attention to this because it is striking, not because it is generally true.<p>It does indicate something different about computing that offsets the benefits of expertise - the obvious factor is that the periodic revolutions in computing technology largely neutralize past expertise, putting old and young on a more equal footing than is usually the case. Some expertise carries over to the next revolution; some does not; and some is actively detrimental.<p>I like the example of postscript, the first product of Adobe, developed  by two guys in their 40's.

No interaction with humans required. (There's human interaction at the point-of-sale, but you still don't have to speak to checkout.) Of course, if they didn't have the book you wanted, you might have to speak to a human to get it ordered ... if they didn't have computer kiosks for you to use instead.<p>Moving this type of sale onto the internet was not a change. Moving the food service industry, where human interaction is expected, into an environment without human interaction goes against people's expectations and habits. Is such a change technically feasible? Yes. Is it practical? Yes. Profitable? Sure, if you can change people's expectations.<p>I'm not saying it's a bad idea. I don't even think it'll be a difficult change. I personally would prefer it. But the first chain of restaurants to offer automated food service (and I do believe it'll need to be a chain) has many psychological barriers to overcome, in its investors and its customers.",1324260480

If industry x really has such a profound impact on a community then it's in the self-interest of voters to reflect that at the voting booth by voting for the politician that will help said industry, and by extension, their community.<p>A private organization greasing the hand of a politician in order to ram a piece of legislation through, <i>against the wishes of said politician's constituents</i> is beyond contempt.

Anyhow, a good idea and a strong implementation do not guarantee success.<p>I'd guess one reason it didn't sell well is because nobody thinks to themselves ""Oh, I need an app that randomly picks meals I already know how to make and gives me a grocery list."" Rather, this is an app that people will stumble upon and decide whether they think it is useful or not.  Perhaps the missing ingredient for this app's success was neither idea nor execution, but rather marketing and a bit of well-timed publicity.<p>Edit: Found the app (<a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/random-chef/id438618418?mt=8&ls=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/random-chef/id438618418?mt=8&...</a>), and I would double down on my wager that it is a marketing/presentation problem: those first 2 screens definitely do not look very appealing.  I'd scratch the paper texture--or if you really do want a paper texture, use something that you'd actually write a grocery list on, and not an ancient manuscript. The multiple different fonts throughout the app don't help with the readability or the presentation.

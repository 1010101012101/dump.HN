That is, what do you when Eve is Bob? In DRM the attacker is also the consumer.</i><p>That's a great way to frame the ""problem"", and I put problem in quotes because it really is something that <i>looks</i> like it has a solution.<p><i>The best we can hope for is that only one piece of software/hardware is capable of doing the job of decryption, and that you can bake it in in such a way that no one else can use the key material. I consider this an open question.</i><p>I don't know your position in the industry, bigmac, but do serious cryptographers (of which I am not) really think that there is a ""solution"" to the problem of Bob being Eve?  The whole point of being able to send bits to Bob is that he can read/use them.  If Alice doesn't want Bob to be able to read/use the bits, because he can't be trusted because he's actually Eve, then why bother sending them?<p>I've heard one argument being that the true purpose of DRM is to keep honest people honest, to make it just hard enough to get access to the raw data that access is discouraged.  If this was the case, then a software based solution with the keys in the program is already workable, as getting access to an installed binary (where the keys would be) on an Android device is already beyond the abilities of most consumers.  It really seems to me that there's this belief by the content producing portion of the industry that there is some holy grail DRM for when Bob is actually Eve.  The problem isn't that Bob and Eve are one in the same in every case, it's that all it takes is one Eve to undermine all the data being sent to any Bob.<p>I agree that if there is a holy grail, it's not going to look like what we already have, since all the current ideas just seem like rehashes of DVD CSS, just making it harder to get at the keys, but once access to the keys is achieved, the method ends up being useless.",1289696276

I had a choice of two TSA screening checkpoints. I picked mine based on the number of people waiting in line, not because I am impatient, but because the coiled, closely packed lines at TSA screening sites are the most dangerous places in airports, completely unprotected from a terrorist attack -- a terrorist attack that would serve the same purpose (shutting down air travel) as an attack on board an aircraft.</i><p><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/10/for-the-first-time-the-tsa-meets-resistance/65390/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/10/for-the-...</a><p>If the someone gets to the airport with explosives, they can do their job of holding up airline traffic without even stepping through a metal detector.

If it's so that all your software, top-to-bottom (excluding the BIOS) is open-source, then get a Lenovo, but if what you want is a better Rails dev environment than Windows, a Mac will do that for you and be less effort in the long run.<p>This is the reason I'm on a Mac, and it's the reason a lot of other open-source or web app developers run Macs as well, and I think it's the secret sauce that's made a big difference in Apple's sales numbers - geeks buy, then geeks recommend.",1289692810

Unfortunately most TV shows I watch are either months behind or don't air at all where I live. So I read about these shows, but by the time I can participate in the conversation the discussion has moved on. That's why I torrent shows. Not because I'm not willing to pay for them (I own most of the DVD sets) but because otherwise I wouldn't get the chance to participate in one of the most gratifying aspects of following these series.<p>More extreme examples are series like Firefly and Battlestar Galactica.

In fact, money that comes 5 years from now is worth less than money today.  Why is that?  As a simple example, let's say you have the option between $380,000 today and $10,000 per month for 40 months.  Which is worth more?  The $380,000 is worth more because if you put it in a CD for that time period, it would become more than $400,000 by the end of that term.  So, money in the future isn't worth its full value.<p>Second, there is risk in a product that generates monthly revenue.  A competitor could come by and undercut you and you have to reduce your pricing (and therefore profits).  Heck, things could get so bad that your product becomes worthless.  A cash buyout doesn't carry that risk.<p>Third, there is money that you have to put into a product over time.  So, you might have something generating $10,000 worth of revenue each month, but you have to work full-time maintaining it and improving it.  As such, you are forgoing other ways of earning money.  Let's say that other way would get you $4,000 per month (low for a computer programmer with such skill - remember, that $10,000 is pretax as well).  So, would you rather $4,000 per month plus $400,000 or $10,000 per month?  At 10% interest (the rate of growth of the S&P 500, you'd have an additional $3,333 from the interest off that $400k bringing you to $7,333).  So, it might not be as much, but you still don't have the risk of your business being undercut, made obsolete, etc.  And if you're earning $80,000 per year (a reasonable salary for a programmer making such valuable programs), you'd be getting $6,666+$3,333 = $10,000 in a much more stable way where you don't have to worry about where the market might go.  Plus, those types of jobs usually come with at least $10,000 in benefits (health care being a big part of that).  And you have no expenses since your employer is paying for the servers and such.<p>So, it's not such a terrible price.  There's a lot of risk they're taking as the buyer and they're taking over all of the maintenance.  Maybe you believe in your product more or maybe you enjoy working on it which gives other value to the project for you.  But it isn't that it will only last 40 months.<p>Again, this might be different if this is a project that requires a few hours a month of work in which case it doesn't change your potential for other salary.  It might be different if you see a great way to expand the project to get more revenue.  It might be different if there are competitors nipping at your heels.  Maybe I'm too risk-averse, but it's important to see how it all fits together - from the present value of future money to the risk of competition and obsolescence to the amount of time you need to put into the project and how you could alternatively earn money with that time.",1240340558

One of them asked me what I did, and I told him about an idea I had for a new way of doing business online. It's pretty revolutionary, I've thought long and hard about it for a long time, and it can probably be easily copied by someone else. I told him about it anyway. Pretty detailed too.<p>It just happened that he was finishing up a PHD thesis on a subject very close to what I was thinking about, and we started talking. This conversation gave me some great insights I didn't have before,  access to his large network, a serious ambassador and maybe a friend.<p>Will he steal the idea? I don't think so. Empirically it is very very rare. Did I gain something from it? Absolutely.<p>Answer enough?",1240340447

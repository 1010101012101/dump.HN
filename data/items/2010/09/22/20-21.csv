Others choose causes based on the US Tax definition of 'non-profit'. Given that both are a matter of choice, it is harsh to call a set of criteria different than your own dishonest and unfair.<p>Or to strike more directly at the heart of the matter: when we behave charitably it is almost always suboptimal. A dollar given to the Gates Foundation is a dollar not given to Habitat for Humanity, and vice versa.<p>To criticize a system of generosity for being suboptimal is certainly reasonable, but now how most would probably want to spend their time.",1285189139

It's a classic slab-serif in the same way that Helvetica and Akzidenz are classic sans-serifs. I don't think it's great because Pitchfork and Ruby Tuesday use it, I'm saying that it's more relevant than you suggested. Designers, somehow, ARE using it.<p>Maybe there is a Clarendon revival. Don't forget that trends are a big part of graphic design, as they are in any design industry.

1717493,comment,1716054,1716402,0,0,damoncali,,,"I used to be a mechanical engineer for several space shuttle missions. You're missing a critical element. Human space flight is <i>insanely</i> dangerous with today's technology. Astronauts accept this and NASA's engineers accept this. The safety requirements for a shuttle launch are voluminous and arcane - to the point where they restrict the freedom of engineers to solve problems to a significant degree. Most people don't know that spaceflight technology has barely improved since the 60's. The primary reason is safety.<p>That a shuttle (and it's crew) blows up is regrettable, but when you strap a cargo truck to a giant tank of hydrogen and light it on fire, someone is going to die from time to time. It's not like they don't know what they're getting into.<p>Figuring out how to keep the crew alive after the shuttle's main tank explodes is just a bad idea. Wouldn't it make more sense to figure out a way to keep the rockets from coming apart in the first place? How many additional failure points would you introduce by creating a failsafe for that unlikely case (of which there are thousands if not millions).<p>Of course we should learn from failures, but the surest way to kill the space program is force it to be safer. If anything, they need to inject more risk into space flight so that better technologies can gain the ever-elusive ""flight heritage"". Trust me, astronauts would still line up for a chance to fly even if you doubled the risk of death.",1285189053

Suggestions for version 0.2 and beyond, in increasing order of utility:<p>Reset/Reset All buttons might be better named Undo and Reset Page.<p>The element selector at the top left goes gray when I have a UX element highlighted for editing. This makes it seem like an inactive cosmetic element because I'm used to things being greyed out. It took me a few minutes to notice it as a button on first use; all my attention was on the target page when selecting a UX element to edit, and when I looked back at Stylebot I went straight to the modifiers. As you put a green highlight around the currently selected CSS element, perhaps not turn the button green rather than the same color as its parent?<p>Beginner Mode for consumers - 'Hide This', 'Bigger/Smaller', or a 'Simplify!' slider, that goes to Readability-like simplicity over 5 stages. Not essential, I just thought the basic layout was still a bit 'busy' for newbies...but then you don't want to be troubled with newbie-type support requests. It's a good layout - but as above, there are so many options that I completely overlooked an important aspect of the selection interface.<p>(Windows only?) UX element highlight is static. Many TextArea controls can be freely resized, eg this comment box on HN (which was probably designed to promote comment brevity...). If I make the box larger while it's highlighted the highlight doesn't follow. Not a big deal, but...<p>...it made me wish I could drag things around to rearrange the layout. There's a little tool for that called LiquidPage: <a href=""http://www.alexschreyer.net/programming/liquid-page-a-bookmarklet-to-rearrange-webpages/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alexschreyer.net/programming/liquid-page-a-bookma...</a> LiquidPage and Stylebot would make a lovely couple. They should get married. They should have children.<p>Presets. If you can save a page look, why not share it with other users? Let people share their setups like themes. Gives you web traffic as well as downloads, stickiness, and repeat visitors. Could later be an outlet to sell a more complex tools aimed at professional; or could also be a source of intelligence site managers would pay for - '93% of Stylebot users hide your sidebar, but nobody seems to mind your topline menu.' Their gratitude would make up for the inevitable hate mail from designers.<p>That's so important I'm going to say it again. Let people share their layouts. Most of them will be lame and you will wonder why you bothered. Then one day someone will make a much better 'look' for some popular website and it will spread like wildfire. People will install Stylebot just so they can use this fabulous new layout for a site they visit every day but secretly hate looking at. This will be controversial, which means lots of media exposure. The famous website will fire the designer and hire the Stylebot layout creator. Users who liked the original design will revolt. The original designer will release his/her own Stylebot skin, with many improvements that /she had always wanted to add but not been allowed to. Designwars will begin on every popular website. Some site admins will try to ban Stylebot, others will be delighted stop wasting time on stuff they were never very good at anyway and focus on content instead of presentation.<p>Let people build presets that aren't tied to any particular website, just collections of parameters for different basic CSS elements. Let people paint them onto existing pages from a palette - select an existing 'clean' or 'fancy' button style and then start painting it onto the buttons that are on a page, rather than adjusting their settings one by one.<p>There are opportunities along the way to work with something like Balsamiq or Wordpress or other content/layout creation services. Users could select or tweak CSS to their heart's content at the client end and upload the results to the page - but that that is justs a sideshow to the main event.<p>At some point you will need to think of a way to easily filter themes on your website before your users do, because there will be a tidal wave of Myspace-type 'sparkle artists' busy remaking the look of the web with glitter, Comic Sans, and animated Velvet Elvis icons. Fortunately, the rest of us won't have see any of that, but the best/worst of these 'artists' will inexplicably be able to make a living from selling their hideous creations to other people with questionable taste. By that stage, a few hardcore designers will stop sending you hate mail and start recruiting ninja assassins to destroy Stylebot forever, but it will be too late, and ultimate layout control will have gone to the dark, er, client side.<p>I jest a little, but I've already decided I will not be going back to the 'old' Craigslist.",1285187719

Because I want at least 12 months of living expenses in the bank before I start buying expensive stuff, ""just in case!"". Wonder where I learned that from?

In our case, like most MMOs, nearly all our messages go back and forth over persistent socket connections, not HTTP requests. Firewalls cause problems and often block persistent connections, but we can get a much much better through put.<p>For example, we developed a product for Turner on top of our platform. Take a worst case scenario - everyone in the game moves using arrow keys, and they're all moving. A typical room might have 25 people, each broadcasting their location roughly every 0.5 seconds. This location update is broadcast to all 24 other people in the room. So each person generates 2 messages into the server per second, but results in 48 broadcast messages per second. Of course there are 25 people in the room, all of whom are moving. So we have 2 x 25 = 50 messages into the server per second, and 48 x 25 = 1200 out going messages per second.<p>A typical node of our platform might support 4000 players. If each room supports 25 people then we have 160 rooms. Every second the server needs to broadcast 1200 x 160 = 192,000 or nearly 200,000 messages, and receives close to 8000 messages.<p>Movement packets are easy. We can route these through the system quickly, but then think about the ""slow"" requests, such as writes to the game state persistence store (Mongo DB) or slower still, writes to the SQL database.<p>With 8000 incoming messages, and a typical 64 thread processing pool each thread needs to churn through 125 messages per second. Or one message every 0.008 seconds. Those slow SQL writes might take 0.5 second, during which time 0.5/0.008 = 62 messages have backed up.<p>Many of our games (and im inferring Zynga's) store huge amounts of persistence / state data. Where has the player been, whats completed, timers, friends, etc, etc. Much more than you'd imagine - and thats not including the analytics data. These slower writes very quickly add up and reduce throughput.<p>Of course there are lots of things to optimise the number of messages, but this starts to give an idea for how quickly messages back up in a MMO type environment.<p>If you've bothered to read this far you might be interested in a short blog post I wrote about our casual MMO architecture <a href=""http://dubitplatform.com/blog/2010/3/4/under-the-hood-dubit-platform-architecture.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dubitplatform.com/blog/2010/3/4/under-the-hood-dubit-...</a>",1285187349

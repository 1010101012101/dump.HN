I had a similar idea, not one I submitted, but an idea for an app. Basically it would be for lobbyists, or groups working for a common goal, that try to talk to politicians and convince them about issues.

That way you can more effectively deal with their concerns.<p>Is that kind of what fantasy congress is?",1192290016

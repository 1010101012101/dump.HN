This is especially true with the judicial branch (hiring better attorneys, surviving longer trials, etc) and the legislative as well (lobbyists, etc). I think it's pretty obvious that a contest of law should never be decided or even influenced by which party is financially better off.

It definitely has a subtext that indicates being a woman in tech is somehow a unique situation - when in reality it should be the standard. Many of my female peers also feel the same way - that they don't want to be talked about in a specific lingo - and simply want to be recognized on their personal merits, which may or may not include overcoming gender inequality. It is absolutely true that the tech industry and American industry at large are sexist and discriminatory.

It was highlighted as an 'experiment', but the law text did not provide that same sentiment, it was a blanket permission to use computers at polling stations, which was at the discretion of the interior minister alone (whom also proposed the bill).<p>After much heated debate, and letters to parliament from primarily Version 2 readers (Version 2 is a Danish IT-news site), Venstre - the largest party outside the government - decided to vote against it.  The three governing parties, Radikale, Socialdemokraterne and Socialistisk Folkeparti were all in favour of the bill, while all the other parties outside the government (including their support party, Enhedslisten, opposed the bill).<p>The arguments for the bill was that it would help disabled people to vote in secret and that vote counting would be quicker (it currently takes 2 days to get exact mandate votes counted), while the arguments against was security and voter trust in the system, which would be undermined by a system only few people can understand.",1363892311

So it was one of the web-based tools I tried. Looking over the paper I wrote, it seems I actually did happily use it for the domain model, the use case diagram and an early version of the class diagram. However, I think for the sequence diagrams I found it a bit clumsy (for example regarding activation boxes) and eventually gave up.<p>I should note that I think most (probably almost all) of my classmates also happily used Lucidchart, as it was recommended by the lecturer too. But I was a bit overzealous and preferred the more rigorous system of astah, like keeping track of the methods you add to each class and the stricter visual organisation of elements.<p>As for particular examples of UML elements that I wish lucidchart had, I can't really remember, unfortunately.",1363892302

So unless you were one of the few who already had a Mac, getting started with HyperCard meant plunking down money for new hardware.</i><p>In 1987, the web wasn't invented yet, and Windows 1.0 was the best the PC had to offer. This had some interesting results in the marketplace, but doesn't really explain much other than the fact that there's value in cross-platform implementations.<p>Apple wasn't interested in making HyperCard/Claris cross-platform, so they didn't.<p>> <i>Again true, but irrelevant. We're talking about contemporary mindshare, and starting in the early '90s HyperCard and the Web were competing against each other in real time. HyperCard had a long head start and yet even by 1995 (the year Netscape 1.0 broke out) it was clear the Web had all the momentum.</i><p>I remember that time quite clearly, and until the mid-to-late 90s, HyperCard and the web were in <i>COMPLETELY</i> different spaces.<p>People were building complex enterprise database-backed applications on top of HyperCard; meanwhile, on the web, we had static pages, and post-1993, if you were lucky, CGI-based e-mail forms and visit counters.<p>Even with the introduction of JavaScript in 1995, we didn't see much other than rotating banners in the status bar until much later. Simply put, the web was <i>not</i> being used for applications at that time.<p>By the time the web did ""break out"" in 1995, Apple had moved HyperCard to their Claris subsidiary, stopped producing updates, and started charging for the authoring tools (a funny thing to do, given that HyperCard had always been Smalltalk-like in combining authoring and consumption).<p>Essentially, the lack of updates and unreasonable pricing led to its demise.

Dr. Sze, has a PhD from UC Berkeley in Clinical Psychology, and specializes in sleep problems. While working at the VA she created programs that helped veterans with decades of sleep difficulties recover. You can sign-up for the class here:
www.dobetter.com/sleep<p>Here's how the class works. Most people who have sleeping problems have lots of habits that cause them to associate bed and nighttime with wakefulness. These include:
Watching TV right before bed
Spending hours in bed trying to fall asleep unsuccessfully
Taking a nap late in the day making it harder to fall asleep or stay asleep at night<p>This class helps you break those habits and create better ones. Through weekly 20 minute video lectures, Jocelyn will explain what those habits are, how they cause your sleeping problems and help you set better habits around sleep by tracking your sleep schedule and making changes to it so that you can fall asleep when you go to bed.
These methods have been validated in a variety of studies going back 20 years. More recently a study of an online program like ours done at the University of Virginia showed that 73% of people with moderate to severe insomnia no longer had any insomnia at the end of program.[1] (This approach is known as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in the research literature)<p>The class starts on March 25, this Monday. We are only taking 100 more students so sign-up soon if you are interested.<p>Curious to get comments as well as signups, we're working on some other courses (with professors from Harvard Medical School) and are eager to hear about people's thoughts about the class model in health.<p>[1] http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=483124",1363890490

You are essentially celebrating the victory of consumer commerce, not technology X over technology Y.<p>Think about it.<p>There never was any battle between the ""Web"" and ""MFC, Java Applets, Webstart, .NET, Flash, Silverlight"". Those thing survive & even thrive in places where nothing else would do. Do you really think everybody in investment banks & brokerages fire up their browser first thing in the morning ? 99% of what they did, do & will continue to do, will continue to be done via native apps - mostly C#, C++, .NET & Java apps. This is just plain reality. It isn't because they are lazy or don't grok the web. Processing realtime trading feeds isn't the browser's strength. Sure I'll show you an iframe with some ticker, equities blotter, trading tickets ...but that's just consumer commerce. I'm soliciting your cash - Here consumer, click on this Buy button, give me your money. After that ? Once you fire off your client request, that's when 99% of the task actually begins, and it ain't on the browser, no siree.<p>The web is just the tip of the iceberg. Most of the action is below the surface of the water, and that's not the web & will never be.<p>To your point - the whole idea behind Webstart, Java applets, Winforms, was to mimic the native UI on the web & try to offload as much client-side logic to the client's machine.<p>Turned out customers didn't like ""fat clients"" - they wanted textfields & simple input forms, accept their inputs & go away & process the inputs elsewhere.<p>We said - Hey, you guys have a fast processor & slow network, let's do this one-time applet download/Webstart download/Silverlight app download, & once done, we won't tax your network, we'll just tax your machine. I wrote one of the first equities trading applet for Goldman Sachs. It was a fat client ~100 MB, you actually waited 10 minutes for the install. But it did so much - all the trading rules validation, portfolio construction & computation, everything happened inside that applet. Once the applet downloaded, it felt & behaved like a native desktop app. It was so much more powerful. There was actual science in that applet. It took a doen CS PhDs to build the infrastructure for shipping that. We fucking got dozens of patents...pseudo-realtime trading applet over the web ha ha ha! Today, the interface is so dumb - zero download time - but they hit the network so much harder. Absolutely nothing happens on the client. To check whether a simple trade is valid, you have to hit the server multiple times during the workflow. Customers are ok with it because the network has gotten so much faster. They were downloading ~100MB applets on 56.6k modems, now they have superfast broadband, so it makes sense to hit the server more & do less on the client box. So you just hire an 18 year old & he'll build a polished web UI for the trading applet over a weekend. That doesn't mean all those CS PhDs just up & died. They just migrated to the server side, where all the action now happens.<p>So this isn't success of the web & failure of the applet - its success of broadband. Network penetration today is massive & ubiquitous. You can place million dollar trades over android. You couldn't do this just 10 years back. At that time, applets were state of the art. In hindsight, the whole exercise appears pointless. 100MB applets WTF, just use underscore dot js & ajax & broadband & a little bit of markup & your trading window shows up on a tiny 4 inch android cellphone. Yeah, true, but we didn't have any of that back then. Cut us a little slack, will ya.",1363890487

While I disagree entirely with jack_trades, I believe their comment provides the most compelling rationale for both Aria Richards' behavior and that of the PyCon staffers.<p>It's been a while, but I have encountered these ideas before. This idea that reporting someone to those in authority because their behavior is ""indecent"" is, somehow, ""speaking truth to power"". That the off-hand comment of a person is a clear indication of ""a sense of entitlement"" and ""and indication of power and control"". The idea that some puns around the term ""forking"" and ""dongles"" is not only anti-social but also a clear rape analogy. You may have heard it before as well: 70's era feminist literary theory.<p>It's not my intention to argue about the validity of Gilbert and Gubar's arguments, I just want to point out that's where I first read about these ideas and first heard a lot of this terminology. I think it's also worthwhile to note that these ideas really took hold in academia, they were talked about quite a bit when I was in college during the 90's.<p>In any case, in my opinion, the real problem is the complete inversion of power. I understand that there are many environments that make women feel unwelcome and I agree that this needs to change and should change. On the other hand, an environment where men feel unwelcome is not the solution. The goal should be that everyone feels welcome. Aria's solution, keeping everyone on their toes for fear of being ""reported"" to ""the authorities"", is no solution.",1363889709

And I can reply from my phone's hipchat client.<p>- Chat rooms and 1-on-1 work seemlessly.

Sharing screenshots/mockups/images is as easy as copy/paste (we use this a lot)<p>- On the right-hand side of the chat room there is a list of all links & files shared in the room that you can easily search through.<p>- You can have guest access in chat rooms.<p>-It integrates with github and other services so that when we do certain things with our repository, it will notify one of our chat rooms.<p>And a million other little things.

I could complain about how they are making a worse version of what we did, but I'm not going to do that. I'm just glad people are starting to see the usefulness of location-based development.<p>You may want to consider it from that perspective. People are getting interested in client-side frameworks. You laid important groundwork for that. Why not be happy about that?<p>There will always be a cycle of change in software development. Trust me, you will not find that this pattern changes switching from front-end JS work to backend ""native"" programming work. The only constant in this world is constant change. If I was not satisfied with that, I would be into something like architectural engineering. When you build a bridge over a river, it lasts for hundreds of years.<p>That said, I like a lot of the points in the article.

8774175,comment,8773778,8773778,0,0,x0054,,,"I find the idea that dominant intelligence in the universe would be artificial very strange. It&#x27;s just a cool idea, with no empirical proof. Look at our own progress. At the rate we are currently going it is far more likely that we learn how to modify our DNA to extend our life spans before we develop true AI. We have barely understood the human brain, how we can possibly even attempt to replicate something we can not understand. I think progress in the biological science is currently, and will in the future, outstrip the advancements in computer science.<p>Also, I find it funny that scientists always claim that the the future people will augment their intelligence with computers, to make them selves smarter. It&#x27;s not a problem of capability, it&#x27;s a problem of motivation. Have you ever heard someone say: &quot;I wish I was smarter!&quot; Maybe, but most of the time you hear people say &quot;I wish I could have X, screw X, live in X.&quot; The simple fact is, most people couldn&#x27;t care less than they already do about how intelligent they are, as long as they achieve the goals that make them happy.<p>In the future we will significantly increase the lifespan of humans, create very simplistic AI to do menial tasks for us, improve technology like 3D printing and molecular assembly, and then promptly have an economic collapse followed by a revolution that will lead to death of technology as we know it or utopia, hopefully the letter. I just don&#x27;t see a place in that chain of events for a consciousness capable AI.",1419019158

8774158,comment,8771979,8773881,0,0,_delirium,,,"> Just having a Java interpretor installed on your system opens you up to untold security threats.<p>That&#x27;s not the case at all. A Java interpreter doesn&#x27;t run with any kind of privileges, so it adds no added security threat above those that already exist when you are able to run code as a user. Having it installed is no more dangerous than having libboost or python installed on your system, if you have any kind of sane setup.<p>The part of Java with a bad security track record is the applet sandbox, which is supposed to make it safe to run arbitrary code in a browser. The sandbox has turned out to be pretty leaky. So I would not recommend relying on the applet sandbox to run arbitrary untrusted Java code from the internet. But for a local app it&#x27;s a perfectly reasonable platform (vaguely in the same category as Microsoft&#x27;s CLR, which is heavily JVM-inspired).",1419019071

In redundant systems, however, I have found it quite effective and generally prefer to solve this problem upstream of the application, in the load balancer, by routing traffic around machines during each machine&#x27;s deployment.<p>First step of a deployment: shift traffic away from the machine, while allowing outstanding requests to complete gracefully. Next you can install new software or undertake any upgrade actions in isolation. This way any costs involved in the deployment don&#x27;t impair the performance of real traffic. Bring the new version up (and prewarm if necessary). Finally, direct the load balancer to resume traffic. We call the general idea &quot;bounce deployments&quot;, as a feature of the deployment engine.<p>Two advantages of having a general-purpose LB solution:<p>(1) You can apply it to any application or protocol, regardless of whether the server supports this type of socket handoff. Though to be fair, some protocols are more difficult to load balance than others - but most can be done, with some elbow grease (even SSH).<p>(2) It&#x27;s possible to run smoke tests and sanity tests against the new app instance, such that you can abort bad deployments with no impact. Our deployment system has a hook for sanity tests to be run against a service after it comes up. These can verify its function before the instance is put back into the LB, and are sometimes used to warm up caches. If you view defects and bad deployments as inevitable, then the ability to &quot;reject&quot; a new app version in production with no outage impact is a great safety net. With the socket handover, your new server must function perfectly, immediately, or else the service is impaired. (Unless you keep the old version running and can hand the socket back?)<p>(By LB I don&#x27;t necessarily mean a hardware LB. A software load balancer suffices as well - or any layer acting as a reverse proxy with the ability to route traffic away from a server automatically.)<p>A technique like this would also be useful for implementing single-points like load balancers or databases, so that they can upgrade without outage. Though failover or DNS flip is usually also an option.",1419017962

8773987,comment,8772258,8772258,0,0,FiatLuxDave,,,"There is definitely a bizarre market dynamic in higher education right now.  That doesn&#x27;t mean that a degree is useless for learning (some more than others, I&#x27;m sure). However, because of the effect of &#x27;prestige&#x27; on school values, there are a lot of undesirable effects on the academic market. It is a weird economic conundrum that colleges are putting out more producers (graduated possible professors) than can find work, while at the same time college prices are rising.  It&#x27;s like farms breeding too many dairy cows and at the same time there is a milk shortage, because only milk from a few non-expanding dairies is considered good enough.<p>Since the perceived value of a degree when it comes to the job market has much more to do with a school&#x27;s reputation than it does with the actual educational accomplishments of the degree holder, what I would do is use the $1 billion to create a new university which would do all it could to spread the prestige away from the schools where it is centralized.<p>In other words, there are only a few Harvards or Cambridges in the world.  If there were 1000 schools of this perceived quality, no one would bother even knowing their names.  You might look one up to see if it was on the &#x27;list of quality schools&#x27;.  In theory, accreditation is supposed to be like that.  But in the real reputation market, Harvard and say, Eastern Carolina might both be accredited schools, but there are significant differences in reputation. I would gladly wager that the best student at ECU is a better student than the worst at Harvard, but the Harvard fellow will benefit from his schools reputation in a way that the ECU fellow will not. And this is why schools with less prestige cannot offer effective price competition with more prestigious schools, regardless of actual quality of education per dollar.<p>This is a problem when it comes to the ever-increasing cost of college, because the reputation effects keep faculty from just going off and making their own new college to compete with their current employer. If the Harvard biology department all took jobs with Example State, this would increase the prestige of Example State, but the professors would feel more of a loss of prestige than Harvard would.  Even though it&#x27;s the same department, with the same professors!<p>So, I&#x27;d hire a bunch of prestigious faculty in a specialized area, to create a school which could compete with the Ivys for e.g. 5% of their student body.  I&#x27;d build reputation for the school by sponsoring contests and conferences which accentuate the dominant position of the new school in its chosen area.  And I&#x27;d aggressively recruit the best students in that area from other schools, by offering easy credit transfer, better student aid, etc.  Until people in one particular field say, &quot;Harvard?  It&#x27;s not like you went to Fiat Lux Dave University&quot;.<p>Rinse and repeat (with as many $billions as available), until sanity returns to higher ed costs.",1419017279

The reasons are multi-fold and I&#x27;d happily share more personal details on why via email, but the main reason why I say no is that you wind up missing a lot of dates and are constantly resetting expectations (this isn&#x27;t abnormal in Software but it gets far worse).<p>Effectively you compete for the every team members time to get things done as no-one is 100% committed to the co-op.  e.g. developer X gets a project from the co-op for 40 hours of work, he commits to do it by Jan 9th, 2015 say, but he also takes another project outside the co-op that has a delivery date of 12/30/2014.  He winds up getting hung up on his first project and so you start resetting expectations for the client.

Your temperature regulation usually has to be impaired in some other way like being in hot conditions, overexertion, or a combination of them. Obviously in infants the story is different due to physiological immaturity but the fever response to infection is a positive indicator of the body&#x27;s thermal regulation working correctly and treating a fever is simply for symptom relief and possibly even detrimental to treating the illness.",1419017189

8773974,comment,8771852,8771852,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"One of the trade-offs we&#x27;ve continually made in computing is between general performance and <i>legibility of</i> performance. Caches (i.e. the memory hierarchy) is one example of that, but we also have pipelining and ILP. Moving up into software, we see this with garbage collection and (more dangerously) with databases. PostgreSQL is great at taking complex queries (many, many joins) and turning them into things that (often) can be very quickly executed. Of course, there&#x27;s no silver bullet. If your join is a full Cartesian product over two or more large tables, you&#x27;re screwed. If you assumed that the table was set up with certain &quot;obvious&quot; indexes and it wasn&#x27;t set up that way, you can get burned on that.<p>We&#x27;ve built systems that are very fast, but almost no one knows <i>why</i> they are fast and when those speed advantages go against us (which is quite rare) it&#x27;s often unclear why. For the most part, all of this has been a huge win. It might make reasoning about performance from first principles ugly, if not impossible, but the economics favor it. That said, we&#x27;re at the point where the only way to reason about performance in many real-world systems is empirically, because there&#x27;s just so much going on in terms of memory hierarchy, network traffic, etc. that is hard to predict in advance. Combine this with the myriad variables, some in the physical world, that can influence performance... and what we end up with is that results that seem meaningful (30 percent faster!) might be artifacts of differences in configuration.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think the term <i>computer science</i> was coined with performance measurement in mind but, all that said, the field is not really a science. It&#x27;s a mix of mathematics, microeconomics, design and engineering... with a lot of science involved, but most often not <i>scientific</i> under the original, strict definition of the word. Science is about investigating the natural world and finding the right answers; CS is about <i>making</i> answers. And they&#x27;re both extremely important, but fundamentally different.<p>Also, just to underscore how difficult CS <i>is</i>, I tend to think of it as a branch of mathematics that lives on an unfair playing field. Reasoning about <i>arbitrary</i> code, in even the most trivial ways, is known to be impossible (Turing, Church, Rice) and much of CS is contending with the obscenity of arbitrary programs (i.e. often having to quantify over the space of programs) and, typically, that means limiting what can be written while still retaining as much power as is needed.",1419017126

8773891,comment,8765027,8768650,0,0,jonnathanson,,,"Sure. But hence my point about opening weekend (trial) vs. what happens after opening weekend (ongoing business, lifetime earnings). You can drive trial of a bad product, but it&#x27;s extremely hard to get people to keep coming back, or to tell others it&#x27;s worth seeing. So your bad product + ultra-hype is basically a recipe for a big opening with extreme decay every day thereafter. This usually isn&#x27;t enough to recoup the production, print & advertising costs of a major movie, especially when you factor in profit-sharing and other cuts to top-line revenue (Rogen and Goldberg are almost assuredly getting points on the movie&#x27;s gross, and it&#x27;s possible that Franco is, too.)<p>A general rule of thumb is that a movie studio spends at least as much on prints and advertising (&quot;P&A&quot;) as it does on production costs for the movie itself. That is to say, if the movie cost $35M to make, Sony sunk another $35M or more into P&A. So it would need to earn more than $70M to break even (more than that, because everyone&#x27;s taking points off the top-line gross, plus profit-sharing with theaters and distributors, etc.). Is it possible that Sony could earn that much on this sort of movie, given its notoriety? Maybe, maybe not. Notoriety alone can rarely get you to $70M. (It&#x27;s possible, but unlikely.) To stand a better chance, your movie also needs to be halfway decent.<p>Once again, I have no idea if this movie is good or bad. Just saying this for the sake of explanation.",1419016202

On the number of seats flown per month it ranks comparatively low (number 18), meaning there&#x27;s a bottle-neck being demonstrated. Either driving is too viable an option, or the airports can&#x27;t handle extra flights.<p>The US is also notorious for having poor passenger rail. Seoul-Jeju carries a lot more passengers, a couple million, but they already have high speed rail, which makes the run in a time comparable to a flight. So being able to shave a half-hour off a commute isn&#x27;t going to be commercially viable when implementing an entirely new infrastructure and design. Many routes out of Tokyo carry comparable numbers to LA-SF, but again Japan also has high speed rail - I think the time saving on the Tokyo-Okinawa (1500km distance) would be the only one capable of competing against high speed rail, but Japan is highly populated so likely not suited for massive and unproven new infrastructure projects.<p>The next option is in Brazil, is a slightly shorter route, but the issue being the economy is less likely to be able to support such a project, and the risk of corruption and embezzlement there could tank the entire project with cost overruns.<p>There&#x27;s really no other credible short distance option in North America. New York to Florida (Miami 5.5mil + Orlando 3.7mil) would be a credible option, NY-Miami is a 2,000km run, passes by Orlando at the 1,750km mark, and the ticket price is almost triple that of the LA-SF run.<p>So if LA-SF isn&#x27;t an option it&#x27;s &quot;Go Big or Go Home&quot;. Crossing states would be a big issue. So we&#x27;re likely going to see this proven small scale on commuter routes in and out of big cities.",1419016036

This will be very clear if you could take just a few moments to go and read the story of Babel, which is a mythological account of the origin and benefits of language diversification. It is a very short story, only six verses long, that will take at most one minute to read.<p>The Babel story is getting misrepresented here from its clear Biblical representation. Some here are spinning as a triumph of progress and advancement through efficient communication.<p>In Genesis, it is given as a situation where common language allows people to display hubris while wasting effort on a completely useless project of attempting to build a tower to reach the sky. This project and its attitude is presented as clearly evil, and diversification of language, babelification, is given as a divine solution to the problem, which is presented as originating from cultural unity, common language, and concentration in a single area.",1419015803

I won&#x27;t touch the freight one, other than it seems to be abysmally unreliable compared to a semi.<p>But a high speed thoroughfare is great now, but soon someone&#x27;s going to cheat and try to lay road across one of those tracks. The high speed lines really need to be separated with no outside interference.<p>I had a weird feeling a maybe ten years ago talking with a friend who is a surveyor. He noted that rail lines often take precedence in disputes, since they almost always predate any other landmarks, including roads. And over the intervening years, in the manufacturing towns I&#x27;ve been in it looks like we put all those rails in the most inconvenient places... Unless we actually just did the opposite and plopped our towns next to all the rail lines. And considering how vital rail was before the highways and cheap fuel, I think that&#x27;s just what happened.<p>Anyhow, just my two cents on it. I think we sorta painted ourselves into a corner with this whole mess. It&#x27;s certainly a political problem, but the solution really would involve positively stupefying amounts of capital, either to make bypass rail or to make those silly roads all overpasses.

As the Sony movie studio&#x27;s network is <i>not</i> a classified US Government network, it isn&#x27;t the NSA&#x27;s job to defend it.<p>So, they may not have even been consulted on this - or (far more likely) their contributions, if relatively inconclusive, may have been cherry-picked for only those specific points which <i>supported</i> a politically-convenient, face-saving conclusion. (Which, as we all know, has happened before on a few infamous occasions.)<p>When you have a big hammer, sometimes everything looks like a nail. When you have a database of every IP address which sends packets transiting a collection point to every other IP address suspected of being a C&C (and the NSA & GCHQ do have exactly that), everything looks like a potential controller. There is a remarkably strong bias towards false-positive confirmation caused by (amongst other things) P2P networks and UDP packets with forged IP addresses. A bias the NSA (and/or GCHQ) would warn about: a warning that, alas, law enforcement tend to not always take to heart - which is (anecdotally) partly why GCHQ rather dislike working with the plod (and quite probably the same feelings persist in the NSA towards the FBI).<p>I still think the links to DPRK are very weak, if they even point that way at all - not that the North Korean government aren&#x27;t vile dictators (they are) but because everything I&#x27;ve seen makes it look more like low-rent organised crime - indeed, I gather the payload and C&Cs used, which the FBI have (IMO) erroneously used in their attribution, are <i>publicly available</i> (though no, I will not link to them)!<p>What I&#x27;ve seen even (albeit weakly) indicates at least two actors with different names, one of whom asked for a monetary ransom, and the latter mentioned the movie <i>after</i> the media did and thanked the other (for giving them access?).<p>It may be (but there is no strong evidence either way) that the latter <i>is</i> actually the DPRK - in which case their &quot;cyber-army&quot; looks like low-rent organised criminals, which I admit would not be implausible, but speaks volumes about Sony&#x27;s stunningly negligent incompetence!<p>The one thing I feel absolutely confident saying is this: Sony Pictures were an extraordinarily soft target, and this was not a display of any high degree of technical competence on the part of the attackers. It could&#x27;ve been anyone from North Korea to a disgruntled ex-employee (of which they have no recent shortage) to some random 14-year-old angry kid, or anyone in between.

Say there are thousands, maybe millions, of such minute alterations in metaphor or thought pattern – is it really so hard to imagine that the aggregate of these alterations form unique, interesting ways to interpret and respond to the world? Do we not see evidence of this when we read, say, the poetry of different cultures? (It&#x27;s a rhetorical question – I certainly think we do!)<p>I got a book last year about learning Old English. I haven&#x27;t gotten very far into it yet, but just the fact that I can go back a thousand years in human history and see where the roots of my language came from is an incredibly cool thing. I am also inspired by the alliterative schemes of old Anglo-Saxon poetry, and have it on the back-burner to see how or how not that could work in modern language (e.g. in Rebsamen&#x27;s &quot;Beowulf&quot; translation).<p>Similarly, whether or not I actually &quot;speak&quot; programming languages like Lisp, Forth, and APL in my daily work, they are a mine of cool ideas and experiments that I can still draw inspiration from, decades after the machines that they were originally built on crumble back into sand.<p>Which probably emphasizes the &quot;cold storage&quot; value of language, not necessarily the &quot;active speaking&quot; value of it. I think the cold storage value of retaining language is indisputably massive, and projects like the Rosetta Project are really interesting to me for that reason. What&#x27;s the value of actively speaking it, even when the community of speakers dwindles? Perhaps it is in helping to cement our understanding of the language before it fades away.",1419015623

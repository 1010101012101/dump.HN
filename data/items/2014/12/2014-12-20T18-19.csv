8777522,comment,8774296,8775497,0,0,wtbob,,,"Every time I see JOSE/JWE/JWS/JWT I want to cry.  SPKI did this, better, more readably and more attractively, back in 1999.  It was also more reliable: JSON itself imposes no ordering on object elements (i.e., &#x27;{&quot;foo&quot;: 1, &quot;bar&quot;: 2}&#x27; and &#x27;{&quot;bar&quot;: 2, &quot;foo&quot;: 1}&#x27; are equivalent, but they will hash to entirely different values, while &#x27;((foo 1) (bar 2))&#x27; and &#x27;((bar 2) (foo 1))&#x27; are not at all equivalent).<p>Moreover, SPKI was flat-out more readable.  Compare:<p><pre><code>    (sequence
     (cert (issuer (hash sha256 |mbKsNmlDk1d1WGcl1s25LDCYeCGjDgC7FFNSdBK8PIE|))

By comparison, the SPKI version is a model of clarity: one can actually see the thing being attested-to; by contrast the JSON version base64-encodes its assertion &#x27;{&quot;iss&quot;:&quot;joe&quot;, &quot;exp&quot;:1300819380, &quot;<a href=""http://example.com/is_root&quot;:true}&#x27;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/is_root&quot;:true}&#x27;</a> (the SPKI version is the &#x27;(cert …)&#x27; expression).  Likewise, where the JSON version base64-encodes &#x27;{&quot;alg&quot;:&quot;ES256&quot;}&#x27; the SPKI version just writes &#x27;ecdsa-sha256&#x27;.<p>As noted, in the JSON &#x27;{&quot;alg&quot;:&quot;ES256&quot;}&#x27;, &#x27;{&quot;alg&quot;: &quot;ES256&quot;}&#x27;, &#x27;{&quot;alg&quot;:\n&quot;ES256&quot;}&#x27; and &#x27;{&quot;alg&quot;:\r\n&quot;ES256&quot;}&#x27; all are different values, even though they mean the exact same thing.  In contrast, SPKI uses canonical S-expressions, so that &#x27;ecdsa-sha256&#x27; encodes to &#x27;12:ecdsa-sha256&#x27;.  Likewise, there are a literally infinite number of ways to encode the JSON payload, whereas with SPKI&#x27;s canonical S-expressions the certificate will always encode to a string &#x27;(4:cert(6:issuer(4:hash6:sha25632:…))(7:subject&#x27; and so forth, meaning that the given attestation will <i>always</i> yield the exact same value, with the exact same hash.<p>Moreover, the key identification semantics are much cleaner in SPKI.  In the JSON version, the key id &#x27;kid&#x27; is an opaque value; in one example in the standard it&#x27;s a <i>date</i> and in another it&#x27;s a UUID of unknown provenance.  In SPKI, keys (principals) are identified by their hashes (the JSON stuff can&#x27;t do this since there&#x27;s no repeatable way to hash a JSON-encoded key).  So the signing key is referred to as &#x27;(hash sha256 |mbKsNmlDk1d1WGcl1s25LDCYeCGjDgC7FFNSdBK8PIE|)&#x27; and there&#x27;s never any ambiguity or concern—and certainly no collisions!<p>And of course SPKI supports a whole lot more than just bearer tokens, being a complete PKI (better thought-out than XPKI too).<p>I propose a corollary to Greenspun&#x27;s Tenth Law: Any sufficiently complicated data-representation contains an ad hoc, dubiously-specified, hideous, inelegant equivalent to S-expressions.",1419101715

It means that I now go to a lot of meetings (frequently with clients), where people draw on my knowledge of how our things work, and build a few things on the side. Mostly marketing material.<p>It&#x27;s a crazy different experience from actually writing the code, and some of what I&#x27;ve learned and noticed has to do with &quot;just being yourself&quot;. Part of that learning process has definitely involved being placed in high-enough stress situations that I was put off internal balance: by gaining familiarity with <i>not</i> being myself, I got a better idea of where myself <i>was</i> and how to stay centered there.<p>The first realization was that I could label my activities as <i>reactive</i> or <i>proactive</i>. As a software engineer, basically all my time was <i>proactive</i>. Now, most of my time is <i>reactive</i>. But... the original phrase I used to describe the <i>reactive</i> activities, and the way I try to approach them, is &quot;to go be myself at things&quot;. The desired outcome is secondary to the experimental juxtaposition.<p>Another way to put it is, I think: I (like everybody) am a unique snowflake. The <i>point</i> of including me on anything and of sending me hither and yon is to have <i>that</i> uniqueness present and available. Well, part of the point.<p>It seems to be working. I think (although it&#x27;s a little early to tell) that I&#x27;m more successful at this job than the last. At the least, I&#x27;m happier. Your mileage may vary.<p>As a final note, when applied to personal growth, I think this attitude ends up something like this: Don&#x27;t aim for results, aim for experiences. Your &quot;higher-self&quot; (whatever that means to you) can&#x27;t just rewrite your &quot;lower-self&quot; (the thing you&#x27;re being when you&#x27;re being yourself), but the former can aim the latter at particular experiences. Go find out what it&#x27;s like to be yourself at that thing, and you learn a little bit about who you are and who you are changes a little bit. It&#x27;s an explorative act.",1419100957

They&#x27;re almost one and the same. I can&#x27;t be responsible for the actions of others based on their own irrational and disproportionate response to a book burning. If burning a Koran is &quot;yelling fire&quot; territory, then that reveals more about the offended rather than serving as a condemnation of the offender. A rational response to someone yelling fire is for people to run and take appropriate life-preserving action because of the thought that there is imminent danger. Burning someone&#x27;s book (or flag) is an expression of an idea, not a call to any particular, expected rational action. Of course if burning a Koran is the same as yelling fire, then that offended community is the problem, not the person committing the act. If you burn a bible, I have yet the hear of Christians partaking in retaliatory bombings, maybe in the 12th century, but not now. Funny because if we accept the official U.S. government premise that Benghazi was the result of a YouTube video, then, in my opinion the whole lot of that subset of the Religion of Peace are beyond redemption and should be marginalized savages.<p>As far as hate speech, in the U.S. hate speech is legal -- as it should be.

The Solar Energy Industries Association&#x27;s members and employees will vote against the reelection of politicians who allow their livelihood to be destroyed but the vast majority of the millions of people who see their electric bills go up won&#x27;t even know why and those who do probably have issues they consider more important to base their votes on.

So I do think the question is lacking of business context.<p>The question asked is a if there is a silver bullet. The problem is optimization are always context related. You can even improve a software&#x27;s sclalabity by changing your processes (who needs concurrencial access to a database if your process can ensure one and only one person is enough to do a certain provisioning that is Single Point of Performance loss?).<p>I mean, my life as a dev would be easier if managers where not asking for cost reductions and forcing technical solutions that increase costs and then convocating us because the company is having unexpected loss, and thus our wages have to be cut (or more often we have to do up to 50% extra hours coding for free) (and their wages are not). So yes, I am bitter, and unnice.<p>And even if you would be posting the &quot;right question&quot; here; then we would conclude that you are asking for a free audit, and also probably leaking business secrets (yep, btw, if you are on a competitive market, the concurrence and your customers now know you have a problem with scaling, and how you take costly decisions without caring about your costs... nice).<p>So with a brilliant reasoning ab absurdum, I can thus demonstrate that neither questions (the mongo oriented or the business oriented) are good questions to ask on HN.<p>It should be an heuristic on HN, and there maybe should a howto ask the right question like this one <a href=""http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html</a><p>Remember you are basically asking skilled people to do part of your job for free while aiming for a lot of money (I still wish you to be successful).

And you may have future (and ex) cyberterrorists(joke)/concurrent/customers/partners/investors/employees here.<p>And you probably think security is about your 128 character gibberish SSO password OAUTH2 compliant chain you are using. Well most successful attacks are using social engineering, so now I know that I can hack you by proposing you a free software with a trojan aiming at solving your problem (using native active record so that it is not a first order backdoor). Or phone you as a contractor, and being paid to have a look at your documents because I know you are technologically a sitting duck.<p>I mean: seriously?<p>Advice #2: DON&#x27;T FEED THE TROLL (TL;DR)
Yep, if you don&#x27;t read until the end, you will not notice that I am serious, but choose deliberately a provocative tone because, I have fun, time, and I see this as the price to pay for my free consulting. I take the freedom to express my views in the formalism I choose. My intention is to see what will be the arbitration made by HN (and readers) between business (what I am saying is valid) and formalism (I say it in a clearly non consensual).

119471,comment,118723,118940,0,0,akkartik,,,"<nit/rant><p><i>""..there would be some serious PhD research in this area.""</i><p>PhD research? I think you mean just 'research'. PhDs aren't the only ones doing research in this world. Neither are they the ones doing the 'hardest' or 'highest' research. Academia is just a different community from that of founder/VCs, or writers, or movie makers, or chess players. It has its own language, its own jargon, and its own objective functions for assigning value to work. But it's not more 'research-y'.*<p>'PhD research' means 'research work for which the audience is in academia'. The way it's normally used, one can just drop the first word without loss of meaning. Just like in the phrase 'personally believe' that William Zinsser picks on.

I should have said ""He can't have a valid basis for suing...""<p>If he shared <i>Patented</i> information, Google would not have free access to use it. A great deal new ideas are patentable (though I hear the process can be a nightmare), but whether or not the Google Sky concept was patented is not the issue.<p>Like I said before, I am pretty sure Google would have had some sort of clause that allowed them to use anything this contractor came up with as a consequence of working at/with/for Google. And if he used an internal Google discussion board (presumably used by those working for Google to share information) to discuss the concept, then Google should and probably does have a legally defensible right to use those ideas for its own purposes.",1203486822

I'd wager that the vast majority do not have any funding beyond credit cards and family. With that kind of budget, outsourcing isn't even something to be considered.<p>Beyond that, we're mostly hackers. Why would we outsource what we do best?",1203486441

My main issue was with the scant detail in the article, which assumes the reader should simply accept the proclamation of harm.<p>Had the article focused more on the more important matter of taking responsibility for the extended consequences of one's actions it would be harder to be dismissed out of hand.<p>Better results may be gained by provoking some introspection than by taking the moral high ground and attempting to shame people into acting a certain way.

119459,comment,118861,119298,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Yeah.  John Cage doesn't really do it for me, either.  While I'm sure he's philosophically important and all that.  I'd much rather listen to a Mozart sonata, Vivaldi, Copeland, Phillip Glass, Gorezki or Arvo Part.  Heck.  I'd rather listen to the Bee Gee's than subject myself to John Cage for crying out loud.<p>Same with so much of modern, deconstructionist art.  You can look at Picasso's cubist period, Pollock or Marcel DuChamp and say, ""They break all the rules, and make us question why we have the rules in the first place.""  And while that keeps me interested for roughly 1 minute 15 seconds, I then want to look at something beautifully done like Picasso's rose or blue periods, or perhaps some Italian or Dutch masters.  I can look at Renaissance master's paintings for days on end because they actually followed the rules.<p>So, the same reason that I'd rather listen to Mozart over Cage is the same reason that I'd much rather watch Bill Murray or John Belushi over Kaufman.

119454,comment,118933,119070,0,0,vlad,,,"There are a few examples of online communities expanding so fast that original users no longer find them intellectually stimulating.  Is there a single root cause?  Are users so overconfident in their mutual abilities to discuss off-topic content safely, that they mistakingly end up allowing their own communities to kick themselves out; is it the fault of the design of the community software and system/processes; or, could it be that the community grew too quickly?<p>As somebody who enjoys this community a lot, I want to know that if 1,000 people start posting random URL's tomorrow, that not only would software filters stop junk from getting through, but that the community would step up and moderate itself because, albeit this is Hacker News, algorithms are never perfect: we are going to have to use our brains to make sure the site is still focused (or re-focused) regardless of how interesting an article might be.<p>On the other hand, there are good signs this may not necessarily happen to Hacker News.  It's very possible that Digg, Reddit, and newcomer social news sites will be enough to satisfy the needs of most users.  This site could be like a chess club in that it's open to everybody, but most people wouldn't care.<p>At the same time, one has to admit that if a social news site continues to address every topic on earth, it could get to the point where as the content becomes more similar to that of Digg or Reddit, there would be an exponential increase in new registrations daily of users looking for the next big thing.  These users would then vote up new types of stories and change the site in a very short time.  I think I read that one can't grow a team by more than 25% in number per year, or one will have a team that has lost qualities of the existing group--this is likely a major factor in retaining consistency and focus for this community, too.",1203485633

Speaking about outsourcing, I am talking about offshore development, outside US, the power of freelancers, who stay below the US market rates.<p>Outsourcing sometimes can save a good chunk of money.  Isn't it a very valuable reason especially for brand new startups, when they count every single cent?<p>Here is my point: a lot of startups are looking for someone to join them for a tiny salary plus huge chunk of equity. So why wouldn't they consider outsources, using the same amount of money, they may not give any equity at all or just a small piece of it.<p>If you do, what're your major pros for it?<p>And if you don't, what're your cons against it?  Would you like to?<p>Personally speaking, we do outsource some of our development.

However, unsavory elements (porn) and respectable ones (news.yc ? :)) can coexist in peace because of the impermeable barriers of bit packets. Social dynamics are osmotic and will lead to re-invention of the new and newly cheap neighborhoods. But will these reinvented neighborhoods be slums? Changes (the more disturbing ones) observed in the article might be temporary aberration, for slums seem to need a combination of cheap housing and proximity to unskilled jobs that pay by the hour; the daily opportunity cost of the commute is quite literal.",1203484634
119447,comment,119214,119412,0,0,rkts,,,"> why I think long multiplication/division became popular? It's easier to grade homework.<p>No, it became popular because it used to be necessary.  Math education (at all levels) is designed to teach 'how' rather than 'what' and this made sense when computation was something you had to do on paper.  As to why it hasn't adapted, my guess is politics.  There are too many people who lack any capacity for abstract reasoning but squeak through math classes by memorizing rules and procedures.  These people naturally make a fuss when the rules and procedures are taken away and they start doing poorly.",1203484536

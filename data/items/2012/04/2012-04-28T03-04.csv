I disagree that I am being cynical for pointing out the self-evident facts that:<p>1. Google spends a <i>lot</i> of quality dev hours programming ""fun"" easter eggs/doodles/April fools sections into their products.<p>2. These efforts gain a lot of positive spin in the media.<p>3. This positive spin helps to improve the image of the corporation as a fun place to work/do business with etc.<p>Now given how many hours that go into some of these efforts, I find it difficult to believe that at least some of them must be mandated by management, but to me that's irrelevant: I'd much rather see all of this dev time being spent on:<p>1. Making Google's products better.<p>2. Contributing to an OSS project.",1335585427

Like the Brydge, it has a solid hinge, and it also has a second battery that charges the Transformer as needed, providing an extra 10 or so hours of battery life (for a maximum of 18).",1335585064

The UI is much snappier than standard desktop operating systems, and the build quality is head and shoulders above the netbooks you can buy at, say, Best Buy that seem to already be crumbling when you get them home. But it's worth noting that it's suprisingly heavy and the weight is poorly balanced, because they need all that super thick glass over the screen. Furthermore, after you use it for awhile, you don't ever really want to <i>touch</i> the screen, because it's faster to type or use the trackpad.<p>Hopefully there is some third way where we can get a snappy OS, vague nods towards physical quality, and a netbook that doesn't feel like an accident waiting to happen every time you pick it up.",1335585029

3901967,comment,3899573,3901688,6,0,sanderjd,,,"There is no silver bullet. I see a sort of taxonomy of techniques, the relative quality of which is very dependent on the person interviewing.<p>An assumption: it is bad for the prospective employer to see no code at all.<p>I see two basic options:<p>1) see code written before the interview, and<p>2) see code written during the interview.<p>Option (1) has a few sub-options:<p>a) look at open source work,<p>b) ask for private personal work to be made available, and<p>c) ask for custom work of your choosing.<p>All of these share the weakness of <i>requiring</i> work outside work hours. There are many qualified candidates who don't have work of the (a) and (b) sort available, and while many see option (c) as a welcome intellectual challenge, many others see it as a tedious (or even offensive) waste of their time.<p>Option (2) also has a few sub-options:<p>a) provide a computer and a project or set of coding questions to be solved in your absence,<p>b) same as (a) but with pen and paper,<p>c) ask a question and watch on a projector or over the shoulder as it is solved on a computer,<p>d) same as (c) but with pen and paper, and<p>e) same as (d) but on a whiteboard.<p>Option (a) is basically the same as (1c) above, but attempts to mitigate the waste-of-time factor by using already-committed interview time to do it, and option (b) is just a much worse variant of the same. The weakness of these options is that it is impossible to get an idea of a candidate's thought process while solving the problem. Option (c) is really good for interviewers but <i>very</i> high-pressure, which selects against many qualified candidates. Option (d) and (e) are identical, but some people hate pen and paper, others hate whiteboards, and most hate both!

3901959,comment,3899080,3899080,2,0,aaronjg,,,"I'd love to see these job queuing platforms have better support for high performance computing (HPC). Currently there are two paradigms of queuing systems. Things like PBS/Torque and Sun/Oracle/Univa Grid engine which work very well for small numbers of largish batch jobs, and things Delayed Job, Background Job and Resque which work well for huge numbers of small jobs.<p>When you start dealing with large jobs, system resources start to become an issue. A job might take 48GB of memory, or it might take 1GB of memory, and the scheduler needs to be aware of this so that it isn't scheduling jobs on top of each other. Or you might have some low priority jobs that should only be run when the queue is mostly full so as not to compete with the high priority jobs. Or you might have jobs that depend on other jobs, and you want to enqueue them all and let the scheduler handle the dependencies.  HPC schedulers deal with these requirements well.<p>On the other hand, you might be in a situation where you have 10s of thousands of jobs in the queue, and you need to add and remove jobs quickly. Things like resque and delayed job handle these situations well.<p>HPC schedulers were built for research purposes, and background job schedulers were built for the web applications. However there are more and more companies dealing with large data problems that span both worlds. They  have some large jobs and tons of small jobs, and they don't want to manage two separate clusters with two schedulers to handle the tasks.",1335584696

This is obvious as to why we think this is true.  This axiom is useful in proving more complex theorems.  That's why mathematicians define such seemingly-obvious statements with axioms.<p>What would a religious ""axiom"" be?

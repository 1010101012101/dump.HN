It can mean a great opportunity, or it can mean devalued wage slavery.  <i>Usually</i> it means filling a role as an economic input in the profit machine someone is constructing.<p>The killer development that would create a bunch of jobs at a stroke would be<p><pre><code>  a tool\n  that lets companies profit\n  by hiring uneducated people.\n</code></pre>\nBut there are other options for helping the masses than jobs.  On the cost reduction front, cheap home solar energy would be huge in terms of saving people from their utility bills.  Optimized-for-small-garden strains of crops could play the same role with food.<p>Also, there are some scenarios where something doesn't create <i>jobs</i> per se, but certainly allows people to make wealth.

Here theres beautiful examples of very customized, very different feeling websites. </i><p>I think Duarte has the right idea, but I think it overlooks something very important: It's really hard to make a great looking website. It takes a lot of design skill, graphic art work, and lots of experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<p>Where Android is failing is providing a way for new developers with little design experience to make great looking apps that fit in with the rest of the OS. They should be providing awesome built-in UI objects and containers that provide great look and feel.<p>If a developer wants to go their own way and make their app look totally different, they don't <i>have</i> to use the built-in UI elements.<p>They should provide a solid foundation for anyone to make great looking apps, but not <i>require</i> that it be used, or even make the framework extensible and flexible.<p>I've been looking at the WebOS SDK recently and it only takes a few lines of JavaScript to build nice looking apps because all the components are provided. You can still make your own custom components if you want to. Layout is done with various built-in layout components with nice options.  The tutorial example has a nice looking interface by the second lesson without any design or graphics work at all.<p>So, Android should provide a UI platform but still allow developers the flexibility to do what they want. They get the best of both worlds.",1319047120

3131253,comment,3130938,3131107,7,0,ajross,,,"The market app quality thing is mostly bunk.  For a while, there was a period where the iPhone gold rush drove all the developers there.  All the polished apps arrived first for iOS, and the Android market was filled with what amounted to bad clones of the known iPhone hits.<p>But that was (comparatively) long ago.  All the ""hit"" apps are cross platform now.  They generally look the same.  Some are better on iOS (Facebook is a good example, though their recent Android releases have gotten a lot better) some on Android (Google Maps on the iPhone was a bad joke, last I checked, and there's no good competitor to use instead).  The tier below that is mixed on both platforms, and there's plenty of junk to go around everywhere.<p>But that first year and a half still colors people's perceptions.  So the canard gets trotted out every time someone wants to play the flame game.<p>And I tend to agree, actually, that Google has the cleaner and better core UI at this point.  Apple wins on the ""performance polish"" issues: the devices are faster and better tuned, UI interaction is (often vastly) snappier.  But I find the actual user experience to be better on Gingerbread than iOS 4 (haven't tried ICS or iOS 5 yet), frankly.",1319047079

There's no question the tech sector is small, relatively speaking, but agriculture and manufacturing jobs are shrinking while technology-based jobs are growing.<p>For every job lost in agriculture and manufacturing, there is a new job in the tech industry. However, unless you are highly skilled, nobody will be interested in you. That is the problem. Farmers desperately want skilled people too, but they will hire anyone if they absolutely have to, simply because the job has to be done. In tech, if you can't find that perfect programmer, it doesn't matter all that much if it takes an additional six months to start the product.<p>Google claims they have approximately 2,000 open positions at all times. If those jobs had to be filled at all cost, they would have no trouble finding people. There are more than 2,000 unemployed people in the USA. The point is that they aren't really in need of filling those roles, it is more of a ""nice to have"" thing.

The same common apps made by the same companies look very different on iOS, Android and WP7. And frequently, they look the worst on Android. This  partly could be because they may not invest as much on Android versions as on iOS or just make quick ports but the platform design tools and the expectations of potential customers also come into play.<p>Since iOS and WP7 provide a built-in look and feel and UI philosopy, developers on a budget can still produce decent looking and behaving apps whereas in Android, it results in a functional but bare looking UI.<p>Case in point, a summer intern at work was tasked with making a basic notes mobile app. He picked Android because that's the phone his dad had and because the company wasn't really interested in the app except as a learning experience for the intern so they weren't interested in buying Mac hardware and developer license(a point in Android's favor). The final app lacked sorely in both design and functionality (more because he wasn't really experienced in coding). I asked him during the demo if he could use some of the Android API transitions and animations between the screens to jazz it up quicky (those make a big difference when presenting to non-technical folks). The reply was that there were none(I am just reporting what he said, I haven't taken a look at the APIs).<p>I do know that iOS and WP7 provide built-in animations and transitions. The point is that you have to go out of your way to make mediocre looking apps in iOS/WP7 and good looking apps in Android.

If you don't get the crop off in a timely manner, you are quickly going to be out of business. I hear farmers constantly complaining how difficult it is to find good people, but they are left hiring just about anyone out of necessity.<p>Manufacturing is similar. You have to keep the products going out the door to stay in business. As such, manufacturers also need to hire someone, anyone, to get the job done. Like the farmers, manufacturers will spend the time to make them better employees.<p>However, in our technology based economy time does not matter. If you make a product and don't make any changes to it in several years, people will continue to buy your products anyway. You can afford to wait to hire who you feel is the very best, even if it takes years to find them. Once you are established, the only way you can lose revenue is if the competition does something significantly better; but they too are waiting on the best.<p>That is the problem that I see. There is no need to hire poor employees. You can wait to hire the best of the best. If they are busy right now, you can hire them later.",1319046402

We're assuming that advertisers would just be getting demographic data, but it would probably go much deeper, and it could be used for broader purposes.  For example, Facebook sees that you're upset about losing a football game, here's an ad which says that you're not a man unless you drink this light beer.  Or maybe you got dumped by your girlfriend, here's an ad showing a happy couple drinking Corona.  They could also analyze broader trends.  There seems to be a lot of middle school girls talking about this band, let's use them in our next advertisement for this frivolous fashion.  Yes, this is already happening to some extent, but they could be much more effective with a data set like this where people assume they are talking to their friends.

Then I untagged myself again, and got tagged again. Then I told that person that I don't like that picture and she got upset.

You know exactly what I mean -- maybe someone has to evaluate a new classifier, and that means spending a pair of 10 hour days looking at several thousand documents and hand labeling.  Or maybe you're switching version control and someone has to go through 5k branches/release branches/tags and figure out what is needed and what isn't.  Or maybe the raid array in the box that hosts artifactory shit itself and someone has to get artifactory back up, recover as many artifacts as possible, and for those that can't be recovered, find their tag in your git repo, check out, and rebuild where possible.  Or maybe your company decided to swap DFSs and your project touches HDFSUtils in 873 places (just to pick a random number =P), and some sucker is going to have to go through each and every place you use that module and audit it for possible breakage during the dfs swap.  Or maybe you need to upgrade from the original hadoop job api to a cascading equivalent, and you have to do this to some 80-odd production jobs; it's tedious work that has to be very carefully performed so the original semantics are preserved.

However, you seem like you don't want to do this.

This way you essentially pass on 'unemployment' payments to companies rather than giving handouts from the government. Presumably companies would thus at least try to use the labor they were being required to hire. I know this sounds a bit like central planning, but doggonit' as we approach an era where we can survive with few in work due to machine help, we may need to regulate in a form of wealth redistribution.

3131015,comment,3130501,3130501,1,0,Francon,,,"Is this really a problem or are people just reacting to hype? It seems to me that our data has been monitored for years both online and offline.  That data is used to target businesses marketing messages but its nothing new.  For example, insurance companies collect data on people and re-sell it to marketing companies.  They then use that information to send you custom messages in the mail or offers based on your demographics.  Data on customers will always be sold to advertisers and frankly, we should encourage this evolution.  Instead of watching advertisements for motorized wheelchairs during ""Murder she wrote"" (I cant help it, I love that show)  It would be more enjoyable if I saw advertisements for something like Motorized Dirt Bikes.  People will always have to see advertisements so isn't it better to see things that interest you?  If the product is free, you are the product and I prefer to be sold to what intrigues me.",1319043766

3131011,comment,3130097,3130914,1,0,mindstab,,,"eeeh the problem is it's way to chaotic. I've head people of the generation who have gone out to the protests say it's about all kinds of things including ""fair wages AROUND THE WORLD"" for instance which to me means everyone in north america takes a hilarious pay cut 0_o\nso yeah, it's hard to see this huge group shouting so many different things, some a bit crazy and assign them any one sensical view point.<p>Sure, some of them want more sane things like banking reform. And so do I. And I can empathize with that. But the group is larger than just that, and crazyier. So I get what the author means when he says he doesn't know what they want other than some utopic thing, because as a whole, it's pretty schizophrenic and nonsensical and impractical.<p>There are too many people out there for too many reasons for it to be a clear and coherant movement. Which is it's strength and weakness. With no clear solid one true path/plan it can continue to draw people from all over the place and amass a much larger group of protesters than otherwise might be possible, which is good in so much as more people is more attention getting, but it's bad in that there is no clear voice or opinion. It means something different to everyone.  So it's going to be hard to accomplish too much.",1319043704

If the key of my car were some physical button or combination on my phone it would be better than real keys. Real keys are better than an app because I can feel then in my pocket, take them out and own the door, fire the engine without looking at them.<p>Actually all terminal, vin, emacs, got, etc users here probably agree: best interface for advanced interaction with complex system is still the console. I would configure and program and repair my futuristic car from a remote keyboard and black screen. Then it will open the doors by nfc when my phone is close enough.

9222513,comment,9219928,9221505,0,0,eqdw,,,"What do you want the label to say?<p>A moderately detailed label, that says &quot;This product is a GMO containing genes X, Y, and Z, from Q Lab at B Company, manufactured on Y/M/D&quot;. This is a good label.<p>A label that says &quot;This is a GMO&quot; is a bad label.<p>It&#x27;s a bad label because it succumbs to one of two failure modes. It&#x27;s an unstable equilibrium.<p>The first failure mode is (I suspect) the underlying motivation for pro-labelling folks. By putting a black box warning label on things, they want to nudge people away from them. The reason this is bad, is because &quot;GMO&quot; is a very large category, and different GMOs have different risk profiles. My personal favourite go-to example, since my girlfriend is diabetic, is insulin. Insulin is mass produced by genetically modified E.Coli. Not only is there no argument whatsoever that this is dangerous, it&#x27;s <i>necessary for her to live</i>. On the other hand, take roundup-ready. Roundup-ready could be dangerous, because a pesticide-resistant plant will get more pesticides used on it. Creating one label, explicitly as a <i>warning</i> label, that encapsulates a category this broad is misleading.<p>The second failure mode is the exact opposite: Prop 65 warnings[1]. Lets say that we get warning labels, but the economic case for GMOs is so strong that people start routinely ignoring them. You end up with a situation where everything is labeled WARNING! CANCER^W GMOS! but nobody takes it seriously. This is a failure mode, both because it erodes confidence in public regulatory authorities and  institutions (which generally exist to protect us), and it causes people to discount legitimate warnings. Like when I got a prop 65 warning about my apartment and assumed it was bullshit, only to find out (while mounting things to the wall) that it was a warning for lead paint and holy shit don&#x27;t do anything to the walls without a face mask<p>----<p>As a compromise, I&#x27;m 100% for labels that seek an informational role instead of a cautionary one. Like how my coke zero has a warning label for PKU[2] consumers: &quot;CONTAINS PHENYLALANINE!&quot;. If products were required to list any artificially inserted genes as ingredients in their ingredients list, that would also be great! But ultimately, I don&#x27;t think this would ever happen. Maybe I&#x27;m overly cynical, but my belief is that the people advocating for labels, want the simple black box warning label. They think all GMOs are categorically bad, want to warn people away, and seek to create a moral panic as an effective way of doing this. I think this is dangerous, because not all GMOs are created equal. After all, GMO rice saves 2/3 of a million children in developing countries every year [3]. I would not want to throw that baby out with the modified bathwater<p>----<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_65_(1986)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_65_(1986...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rice"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rice</a>",1426636481

More importantly, I&#x27;m not the person you would have to convince, and the people who <i>would</i> need to be convinced consider this argument over and done with long ago.<p>> OS X, Windows, AIX, and Solaris all manage to provide stable interfaces for drivers while still evolving the underlying implementation significantly. So clearly, it can be done.<p>By accumulating a massive amount of cruft that they can never remove.  Yes, it&#x27;s <i>possible</i>; it&#x27;s also possible to run the old kernel in an emulation layer to run older drivers, but that doesn&#x27;t make it a good idea.  (Though that&#x27;d probably still be a better idea than attempting to support the old in-kernel APIs in a newer kernel.)<p>And incidentally, if you need kernel ABI stability, you can also go run RHEL, which backports changes from newer kernels while maintaining in-kernel ABI stability for out-of-tree drivers, within a given major release.  So for the support lifetime of that RHEL release, you can count on ABI stability.<p>>  The idea that the Linux kernel should or can contain all support for all hardware ever is an ideological pursuit at best.<p>And, in practice, a shockingly successful one.  There&#x27;s very little mainstream hardware left that the kernel doesn&#x27;t have in-tree support for.  (No, that&#x27;s not an invitation to enumerate the remaining exceptions.)  And even for a fair bit of nVidia hardware there&#x27;s the reverse-engineered nouveau driver, which is good enough for desktop environments and light gaming on the hardware it supports.<p>However, for a production-quality Linux system, it makes more sense to select hardware with in-tree drivers.<p>> And people still report stability and crash issues with mainline kernel drivers too, just perhaps less frequently, so that&#x27;s really an orthogonal concern.<p>I never suggested it was related; I&#x27;m arguing that there are good reasons to not use the nVidia drivers <i>other</i> than that they&#x27;re out-of-tree and proprietary, namely that they&#x27;re notoriously crashy.",1426636458

The keys conform to your hands, rather than the other way around.<p><i>Also, the idea of a split keyboard was popular some time ago. Is it still considered important?</i><p>Again, in my opinion, yes.  Absolutely.  I&#x27;m sure this varies to some degree by body size, but I find it profoundly irritating to have to shove my hands together.<p>Mechanical keys are great (which the Kinesis uses -- Cherry brown or red -- aside from the previously mentioned, horrid F-key row), and a few keyboards royally screwed up by purporting to be ergonomic by shape, but using really awful keys.  Specifically, the Microsoft &#x27;Natural&#x27; was an ergonomic nightmare.  Every key was a simple friction post-mount, including wide keys like shift keys.  This meant that you&#x27;d type along and occasionally hit a <i>really</i> high resistance key.  This flared my tendinitis up like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.<p>So, yes, consistent, reasonably light key pressure is absolutely critical, but in my opinion the separation of hands AND the additional employment of the strong thumbs for more than space is a great idea.<p>Oh, and by the way, note that on the Kinesis the arrow keys are just below the primary keys (up/down are right hand, left/right are left hand).  You don&#x27;t have to move your hands from their home row position to use directional keys.

It&#x27;s hard to tell without verifying the details.<p>For example, suppose a company hired a female CEO during the market bottom in 2002 and fired her before the crash in 2008.  Then, that would cause the &quot;female CEO&quot; statistic to be inflated relative to the S&P 500.  If you calculate the relative IRR, it&#x27;s more correct.<p>I.e., instead of a buy-and-hold S&P 500 investment vs buying/selling when the female CEO is hired/fired, you should instead buy $100k of the S&P 500 and female CEO stock SIMULTANEOUSLY, and then cash out both holdings when the female CEO is fired.<p>If you buy-and-hold the S&P 500 for 12 years vs buy/sell during a female CEO tenure, that&#x27;s an apples-to-oranges comparison.  That isn&#x27;t properly adjusting for the market conditions when the female CEO was hired/fired.<p>He didn&#x27;t provide enough details for me to check.

It&#x27;s got working libraries already.<p>But if you are getting into that, glyphs in a font are stored by &quot;glyph name&quot;, not necessarily by code point. There&#x27;s a bunch more steps than that.<p>- Font substitution: Find fonts that cover every character in the text. The order of your search list depends on the language.<p>- Text layout and line breaking: for best results, you don&#x27;t want to line break in the middle of a word, and you need to place punctuation on the correct side of right-to-left sentences. I think both of these need dictionaries.<p>- Choosing individual glyphs: it&#x27;s complicated!

The firmware allows on-keyboard remapping and macros, by the way, so my Caps Lock ==> Esc remap follows my wherever I go.<p>If anything, I&#x27;d rather that the separate key wells were even a bit further apart.  I don&#x27;t know how people can type with their wrists jammed so close together, even with the Atreus&#x27;s angled halves.<p>By the way, on the Kinesis, the hand wells are actually dished.  They achieve this using a flexible PCB that&#x27;s split into separate &#x27;fingers&#x27; for each row of keys.  To my knowledge none of the &#x27;hacker&#x27; keyboards are dished like this.",1426633607

9222257,comment,9219162,9220715,0,0,eridius,,,"Why does Unicode need to represent a half-written Japanese word? If it&#x27;s half-written, you&#x27;re still in the process of writing it, and this is entirely the domain of your text input system.<p>Which is to say, there is absolutely no need for the text input system to represent all stages of input as Unicode. It is free to represent the input however it chooses to do so, and only produce Unicode when each written unit is &quot;committed&quot;, so to speak. To demonstrate why this is true, take the example of a handwriting recognition input system. It&#x27;s obviously impossible to represent a half-written character in Unicode. It&#x27;s a drawing! When the text input system is confident it knows what character is being drawn, then it can convert that into text and &quot;commit&quot; it to the document (or the text field, or whatever you&#x27;re typing in).<p>But there&#x27;s nothing special about drawing. You can have fancy text input systems with a keyboard that have intermediate input stages that represent half-written glyphs/words. In fact, that&#x27;s basically what the OS X text input system does. I&#x27;m not a Japanese speaker, so I actually don&#x27;t know whether all the intermediate forms that text input in the Japanese input systems (there&#x27;s multiple of them) go through have Unicode representations, but the text input system certainly has a distinction between text that is being authored and text that has been &quot;committed&quot; to the document (which is to say, glyphs that are in their final form and will not be changed by subsequent typed letters). And I&#x27;m pretty sure the software that you&#x27;re typing in doesn&#x27;t know about the typed characters until it&#x27;s &quot;committed&quot;.<p>Edit: In fact, you can even see this input system at work in the US English keyboard. In OS X, with the US English keyboard, if you type Option-E, it draws the ACCUTE ACCENT glyph (´) with a yellow background. This is a transitional input form, because it&#x27;s waiting for the user to type another character. If the user types a vowel, it produces the appropriate combined character (e.g. if the user types &quot;e&quot; it produces &quot;é&quot;). If the user types something else, it produces U+00B4 ACCUTE ACCENT followed by the typed character.",1426633306

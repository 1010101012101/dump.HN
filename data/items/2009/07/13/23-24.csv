An aggressively-priced low-end version could sell very well there.<p>The higher end of the market is served by specialized lighting dealers.

702746,comment,702466,702466,0,0,ellyagg,,,"You can change this trait! I promise you, you're not stuck with it.<p>I'm about your age and I was a huge procrastinator and underachiever until only 2-3 years ago. Since then, mostly through ""grit"", I was able to acquire a job as a senior software engineer, despite having no degree, and not even owning a computer until I was 23.<p>I suspect you are like me in that you are much more interested in novelty and idea generation than in execution. I always had good ideas and did well on aptitude tests, but was seriously short on follow-through. I overcame my procrastination mainly following two principles:<p>1. Focus on one main project/goal at a time. Period. I know it sucks, but it's simply too easy to get distracted if you don't handcuff yourself. Every project has interesting parts and boring parts. If you have multiple projects, you end up thinking about the interesting part about some other project as soon as you get to a boring part of the first.<p>Figure that you'll do everything you want to do serially instead of in parallel. This makes it all the clearer how little time there is in life to do everything you want to do, and the realization is painful, but that's too bad. You aren't <i>actually</i> getting more done just because you've got multiple projects going on at the same time. In fact, for some (most?) of us, you're getting less done.<p>When you don't try to do anything seriously, it seems like you can do everything. It will be demoralizing to see how slow progress is when you're focusing on only one project. It's still worth it in the end, and you'll finally get a better understanding of the actual scope of your capabilities. This will allow you to make better decisions about time expenditure going forward.<p>Make the one thing you focus on have a definite end point. A goal. It can't be ""get better at the piano"". It has to be, ""give a live performance"".<p>Maybe some people can have multiple concurrent goals/projects. You can't. The sooner you face up to this, the better off you'll be. You'll feel like you're cutting off the boundless possibilities open to you. You ARE. That's life.<p>2. Do the boring parts. If you can learn to take pride in doing the boring parts, you will be formidable. A lot of idea people/dreamers never figure this out. Ideas are so damned fun to think about.<p>Count your blessings. In my opinion, it's easier to learn to do the boring parts than it is to become creative.<p>The advantage of focusing on one goal/project is that there's nowhere to hide when you get to the boring parts. If you want to finish, you have to do them. Your mind can't casually escape into thinking about the interesting part of another problem because there is no other problem. This is huge because the problem of avoiding boring parts is abstract, often gradual. It sneaks up on you. You've got to constantly be on guard for avoiding the boring parts of the project.<p>These days, I always know what my project is, and I can state it succinctly in one sentence. I keep it in my mind at all times so I know exactly where I'm going. In addition to the original inspiration, I take pride in powering through the dull intermediate steps of a project that most everyone else fall down on.",1247528255

The lack of rain has hit northern areas most, but even in Mumbai, which has experienced heavy rainfall and flooding, authorities were forced to cut the water supply by 30% last week as levels in the lakes serving the city ran perilously low.""<p>Heavy rainfall and flooding followed by severe drought. This is a standard pattern across India, not just in Mumbai. Indian villages always have had water storage ponds - in fact most Hindu temples have a pond attached to them, which serves to recharge the ground water level in the whole village.<p>What happened in the last 40+ years is a complete dismantling of traditional village governance, initially replaced with State-government appointed government bureaucrats (almost all of whom didn't reside in the village they were supposed to administer and rarely even visited it) and then much later, an elected village body that has few real powers, and still answers to a State-appointed bureaucrat.<p>It was all done with the best of intentions. But it ended up centralizing rural administration - destroying the village in order to save it. Simple tasks as desilting the water storage ponds were neglected, and eventually many of those ponds were encroached upon. This is true everywhere in India, in major cities as well as  small villages.<p>So it is not simply just nature that is the problem here.",1247527947

We're good at concentrating and love working in the realm of ideas. However, we're often an impractical lot and procrastination is pretty rampant among the other INTPs I know. The biggest problem, I think, is that we just really suck at perceiving the passage of time, and the daydreaming, writing, or discussion of ideas is often rewarding enough just to stop there.<p>INTJs are supposed to have many of the same qualities of INTPs but tend to be more sure of themselves, and therefore, more productive (or more capable of delivering 'products' within 'deadlines'). They seem to live in the moment a bit more, and I would venture to guess that they make better entrepreneurs.<p>As an INTP, I feel I can relate to your situation.

It really bothers me that I have little to show for all the work I do in my head, and this frustration has helped motivate me, but I still don't feel like I've been truly 'unlocked'.<p>To compound the problem, INTPs make up about 1% to 3% of the population, which means not many people can relate to the INTP mindset and are more likely just to call you a whiner without attempting to appreciate where you are strong, and why that strength makes you weaker in other areas.<p>Any INTPs out there who feel they've overcome their temperament's negative traits?

Microsoft will be sacrificing significant revenue by offering a free version on the web.  Figuring out how to distribute features between the free and paid versions will be tricky, too.  If people can't figure out whether they are supposed to use the free web version or the paid version, they will be confused and upset just like Vista customers who couldn't figure out which version to buy.<p>A lot of risks for Microsoft, with little upside.

Very very stupid of me.<p>The next step was to upload a nice little backdoor filemanager package written in php and run it from the download directory (this must have been harsh because the url switches after every download). Eventually they got access to the password hashes, but since I found out about the hack within 24 hours I just changed the passwords on the system after plugging the hole.<p>Obviously the way to handle that was to refuse files whose exension is .php.<p>I still can't believe that it was that easy to get in, and I feel totally stupid for not having foreseen that.",1247526463

They also support Firefox, Safari, and (maybe) Chrome.<p>I can't fathom how this won't put Microsoft into the javascript performance arms race with IE. How can they not invest heavily in making their own browser lightning fast with complicated ajax apps when all the browsers they support will perform better with Office web than IE?<p>Just seems to me that with every browser competing to have incredible web performance and compatibility, we're all going to win a bit in this case.",1247526457

Not exactly practical for everyone, but if more people did this the world would be a more understanding place.<p>Did it make me procrastinate less?  I'll tell you the day after tomorrow =\ (not really).<p>What <i>did</i> get me out of the procrastination habit though, was the Getting Things Done book, I'm not ashamed to say.  I'm not an adherent of everything in that book, but I followed the basic system it outlines until it became second nature.<p>The system allowed me to clear my plate enough for me to realize that the cause of my procrastination was a sort of paralyzing fear of all the 'stuff' I needed and wanted to do.  The amorphous blob of stuff was completely overwhelming.  It can be a very scary thing.  And that fear gets converted into inaction.  But when you have a reliable framework like GTD to break the stuff down into concrete action steps, that fear is evaporates, and you can actually DO.<p>I'm an armchair psychologist over here, but this was the case for me.  YMMV.<p>Also, to echo the point of the post above, my girlfriend at the time (now wife) also was totally not supportive of the GTD thing...but later became very impressed with the transformation.  Just because people aren't supportive of you changing, doesn't mean they don't love you, and that they won't come around.

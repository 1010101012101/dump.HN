Everything more recently has focused on rising productivity as a desired effect instead of an a priori cause.<p>The paper concludes that in the short-run, rising productivity decreases inflation, increases the current account balance, increases GDP, and increases unemployment (and real wages) as aggregate supply increases without a commensurate increase in aggregate demand. The system starts equilibrating as people internalise the higher productivity into their investment assumptions.<p>We could see falling <i>rates</i> on student loans coupled with rising returns on education (note: not just college education, as the OP pointed out) as increasing the incentive to invest in one's education. Given that our culture creates barriers to education the older one gets it seems like we will have a wasted generation of un-skilled workers who will just need to be worked through the system (being a cold, pragmatic macroeconomist here). Being civil to those people without incurring undue cost to the system will be the challenge.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.treasury.gov.au/documents/239/PDF/paper07.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.treasury.gov.au/documents/239/PDF/paper07.pdf</a>",1330537999

But I do agree that it's surprising for a move from 2.3.5 to 2.3.6 to break backwards compatibility.  Have we forgotten Ruby's ideal of the principle of least surprise?<p>Perhaps a good compromise between what Rails is currently doing and what it should be doing is to add a fourth version number.  When the fourth version number changes, you can rest assured that the change is backwards compatible.  (However, there is always the danger that some plugin/engine/gem author monkey-patched a part of Rails which could make their code break during a ""backwards-compatible"" upgrade to Rails.)",1330537965

That makes it easier to test and modify the internals. D3's force layout is specifically-tailored to graph layout, so I don't consider it necessary to make the implementation so modular; the requirements of the force layout are that it is fast by default, that it can be customized with incremental additional effort, and that it is convenient for the common cases.<p>Also, with larger graphs numerical integration is one of the few places where JavaScript performance (not just rendering and DOM manipulation) actually matters; while unfortunate, it's often necessary to make a trade-off between generality and performance. Still, I'm considering more modular reusable forces and constraints for a future iteration of the force layout (perhaps similar to the older Protovis force layout). But since custom forces tend to be very well custom, I think the best option is simply to modify the nodes' positions as needed and let Verlet do the rest.",1330536394

This is a really uninteresting benchmark, however, since everyone is close to C++ (although NumPy, Octave and R still introduce 20%, 69% and 165% overhead, respectively) because you're really just comparing C++ against C++.<p>One of the key concepts behind Julia is that not only the end-user, but also the numerical library writer, should benefit from using a high-level language. In Julia, almost all of the library code is in Julia, and it's as fast as the library code written for R, Matlab or NumPy in C. There are also a lot of situations where vectorized code is either awkward or inefficient  especially in terms of creating a lot of unnecessary temporary arrays. Languages where the high-level language is slow force you to do everything vectorized in Julia, you're not forced to do that. If you want to write a C-style scalar loop, you can and it will be fast (and you don't even need type annotations to make it fast, as shown by the benchmarks).<p>V8 is really impressively fast, but JavaScript as a language is not very well suited to scientific or technical computing.",1330536382

3. The public publishing right can be revoked by the author or publisher.
4. The author is getting royalties.
5. There is no censoring.<p>Let's compare to another somewhat related case of royalties land grab, iPhone publishing:<p>1. Aim to control and profit from other people work.
2. Applies to all iPhone published work from day one.
3. There is no alternative other than not publish your iPhone app.
4. Apple gets a cut, always.
5. Apple gets to decide what gets published or not, unilaterally.<p>It's funny also to compare this to, say, how the music radio system works. Hey, it's compulsory diffusion of work without the author consent with a government-prescribed royalty payment system. For current works.

This leads more towards people who are inclined to take that sort of route instead of ""earning"" it through work. (Earn might be poor word choice here)<p>The other side of the coin to look at too is the type of people on those shows. It isn't a secret that they finely tune who is invited to participate and the show producers will obviously elect to cast people that are more ""drama prone"" or capable of providing that level of entertainment value.<p>Maybe if we take a step back and look at it from the meta level we could say that an indication of the general population ""becoming more dumb"" is the idea that we are willing to suck up this form of entertainment more and more. Is it a sign of being dumber when we more inclined to watching people generate meaningless drama, fight or expose themselves instead of intellectual stimulating programs?",1330535031

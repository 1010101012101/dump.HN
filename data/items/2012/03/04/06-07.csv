3662188,comment,3661947,3661947,13,0,georgieporgie,,,"Can anyone with kids comment on whether or not computers are even exciting and empowering anymore?<p>When I was eight, we got a Commodore VIC-20.  It plugged into the TV and booted into BASIC.  Just running PRINT statements and simple loops was unbelievably cool.  I learned key positions (and how easily mistakes are made) by spending hours typing in bytecodes printed in magazines.  With any luck, at the en of it, a completely unforeseen game would appear.<p>Getting to play with Logo on the Apple ][e was awesome, too.  Shapes and angles and horribly flickering animations were exciting.<p>Now, it seems to me that the difference between Dive Into Python (or whatever) and Call of Duty are so immense, that even running Hello World would be a disheartening experience.  But maybe I'm just too nostalgic.<p>Incidentally, I distinctly remember from my first proper high school programming course (Pascal) that the instructor asked why we wanted to learn programming.  Every single student responded, ""to make games.""",1330844332

3662166,comment,3661731,3662113,11,0,jandrewrogers,,,"A fact I find distressing is that the poster is largely correct. Somewhere around 70% of biomedical R&D is done in the US, the utter dominance of the US in this market is not controversial. Most of the rest is done in Asia. The biomedical R&D done in Europe is rapidly approaching a rounding error. I, for one, do not like the fact that the entire world is dependent on the biomedical R&D of US companies. Yet that is the current state of affairs. And the private companies in the US spend money on this research that dwarfs what all but a few countries spend.<p>I wish more people would acknowledge this reality. I like biomedical technology advancement. Most of it is developed in the US because it is the one of the few countries that can absorb the cost of the R&D. If the US stops doing it, who is going to pick it up? There is ample evidence that the answer is ""a little bit in Asia and nowhere else"". That should be frightening to people. Biomedical R&D is important.<p>Ignore for the moment that the US healthcare system is a wreck. The fact remains that the majority of biomedical advances come out of the US because it is the only country where people absorb the R&D cost. If Europe was pulling its weight with biomedical R&D it would be one thing but in practice it is producing so little in that regard that it is kind of shameful. If we eliminate US biomedical R&D by eliminating their ability to recover costs, who picks up the slack? There are no easy answers.",1330843332

3662148,comment,3633369,3633369,1,0,wisco_kid,,,"Great question. I think the big thing is that you have to get exposed to different things. If you don't have your own itch that could be scratched for profit, then you need to find somebody else's. Some of the posters mentioned learning about different domains and niches; to me that's the key. If you are a problem solver with an entrepreneurial streak, you will find itches that need to get scratched just from talking to people about what they do.<p>The key is: how do you get exposed to new domains? I'm sure most business managers/owners could name 3 or 4 things they wish they could make better. However starting that conversation with them is difficult.<p>My wife does some direct sales stuff (Pampered Chef, Lia Sophia) and the key concept with their sales training is: get on the damn phone! Make 3 calls a night, that's it and your business will grow.<p>Idea generation is the same thing. Just think if you could have 3 conversations a day (heck, even 1 conversation a day) with people about what they do during the day. I bet you'd have multiple actionable ideas in a week.<p>It sounds easy and trivial, but it isn't. I know this works but I haven't done it yet. I'm not brave enough, charismatic enough, too big of a p<i></i>*y to just start up conversations with people, at least so far... But I think if you go to the core of most business startups, that didn't start with a guy/girl solving her own problem, you'll find that most of them started by putting themselves out there.",1330842542

There is an open question of how to do that while mitigating the damage potential. There are also cases where multiple personas might usefully be linked. For example, when commenting on programming issues you might want to link your persona to your stackoverflow identity or your HN account. Honestly, the biggest mistake I could make would be to assume I know what the community wants before we have a community. I think it's probably wise to err on the side of less friction and more prismatic identity and deal with restricting multiple signups if/when we need to. For now I plan to enforce uniqueness for outside identities (only one pseudonym per Twitter account) but also allow a basic reCAPTCHA username/password signup. If someone wants to contribute code to manage multiple personas within one account that would be fabulous, but annotation functionality feels more priority for me.

3662138,comment,3661731,3661896,8,0,Cadsby,,,"I agree that much of the general public is insulated from price, however a few personal observations: (Note: I worked for 8 years for a state insurance company and my wife has been a nurse practitioner for 12 years)<p>People don't ""shop"" for healthcare the same way they shop for televisions or other consumer products. In fact the overwhelming majority tend not to all. Either someone like me at their insurance company picks a primary care physician for them, or they pick one from a list based on simple factors like someplace convenient, seems like it's a good part of town, etc. Unless the doctor is so unbelievably terrible, it's extremely unlikely they will switch. My wife, who is frustrated by many aspects of our healthcare system, attributes much of this to the complete and utter lack of medical literacy possessed by the general population. The average person simply has no idea how modern medicine works on any substantial level, so they have little to no basis for making an informed decision about their care or provider. When you are sick, even with something routine and non life-threatening, you don't think ""Hmm I could go see the doctor today because I feel awful, but I think I'll price shop for a day or two beforehand."" Even people with strong financial incentive, i.e., people with limited means, don't do this. If a child or loved one is involved you're even less likely to start thinking about dollars over medicine.<p>I do agree that most patients have no accurate understanding of the real cost of their care, and that more education in that department certainly can't hurt, but no matter how you slice it, that cost is simply much higher than it is in other developed societies, and that is a serious problem that needs to be addressed.<p>Edit: Something I wanted add: I know in a community like HN, many will be of the sentiment that if you fail to educate yourself about a product or service, you borderline deserve the consequences. I agree with this in most respects. However, taken to it's logical conclusion, that would require me to become an expert on everything under the sun. I have no idea how the plumbing in my home works, or how to do anything but routine maintenance on my car. It's not that I lack the interest to learn about these things, it's simply that there aren't enough hours in the day to plausibly accomplish this. When faced with the need of a professional expert, I have to use a little common sense mixed in with any superficial knowledge I do have, and trust that there is a system in place that prevents me from being totally screwed price wise.",1330841955

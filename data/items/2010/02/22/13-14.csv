However, I still don't think it's a sufficient response.<p>I agree completely that writing code on a whiteboard is utterly alien to some people, and is so completely divorced from their usual way of working that it's unlikely to give a true picture of how they will code in the real job.<p>But we're not asking for an insight into how they will code in the real job.  We're asking if they can write something like, say, FizzBuzz.  More, we're not even asking them to be syntactically flawless and optimally efficient.  We're asking if there's any chance that they'll produce working code at all.<p>I agree that there is to some extent just a disagreement about where to draw the line, and how detailed/accurate the solution has to be, but my experience is broadly in line with the worst claims - 95% of people who approach me for a job in programming can't write code at all.<p>For the remainder I'll ask how they usually write code, and then collorate with them on something more complex to see how they work.",1266847037

Many smart people who are experts in probability theory answer it incorrectly at first and then it takes them a while to convince themselves they were wrong.<p>2. On the other hand, if you read about it and understood it once, it's trivial, and you can give a correct answer confidently while still being very bad at probability in general. So you'd be selecting for knowing a piece of trivia rather than any real knowledge or experience.<p>3. Interviewers are not flawless mechanisms, they're people. They have biases that are different to control for even when they're aware of them. You want to steer clear of questions which a) make it easy for the interviewer to feel smugly superior to the candidate; b) the answer to which looks very easy and natural once you know it well, and it's difficult to remember how non-intuitive it had been before.

It's also a kick-off point for other questions. Often there are things the person will do along the way to a solution that reveals some lack of knowledge, so I keep my eyes peeled as they talk through their solution for these potential gaps.<p>One of the biggest problems now is that you have people who can even pull of FizzBuzz but don't know much of anything beyond how to get something like that working. They don't understand data structures, algorithms, or how a computer really works.<p>A simple coding exercise like FizzBuzz <i>can</i> reveal these gaps too, even if they get the problem right. The trick is to use their implementation as a way to probe their thinking.<p>For example, if they are just using a ""sort"" function, like in Ruby, ask them how it contributes to the runtime of their algorithm. Or, if they are loading a file into RAM instead of just iterating over reads on a file handle, ask them about it. Or, if they are iterating over the keys of a hash (h.keys), ask them how they think that works. (This recently revealed to me the candidate did not understand that a hash function was irreversible.)<p>None of the major gaps in knowledge I've found that separate mediocre from good candidates were found by just looking at their code and giving them a thumbs up or thumbs down. That's good for separating the mediocre from the morons. To find out if they're good, you have to probe.<p>To find out if they're great, well, that's another story entirely that is far afield from FizzBuzz :)",1266844838

1142557,comment,1142398,1142547,0,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, I think it's a good test for that reason. I personally would probably do badly on a complicated programming test--- I tend to program best when not in a room with other people, not being put on the spot, allowed to think while walking around outside and then return to a burst of coding, etc. But I could write a few lines of obvious code in pretty much any situation; there's a pretty big difference between peak performance and absolute minimal competence.<p>It's hard to make analogies to other fields, but it feels sort of like a writing job not asking you to write an insightful philosophy essay on the spot (legitimately difficult), but just asking you to write a paragraph of grammatical English (anyone even remotely fit for the job should be able to do it).",1266844228

That's why people who criticize ""FizzBuzz"" as not testing the true requirements for a job are simply wrong.  All you want is some real code that produces a correct answer.<p>My programmers wrote FizzBuzz in under 60 seconds.  If you can't write FizzBuzz in 15 minutes in an interview then you are either unable to program, or <i>any</i> level of stress will prevent you from doing your job.  Either way, you couldn't work for me.  I don't routinely stress my programmers, but stress is a matter of observable fact.",1266843779

1142545,comment,1142305,1142437,0,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, there's more scope to maneuver in a fiat-money system; I was mainly objecting to what seemed to be the suggestion that under a gold standard FRB and the money multiplier somehow wouldn't exist. It seems that some people in this group want to somehow mandate that everyone conduct their transactions by literally exchanging gold coins in bags. But the people with that viewpoint tend to also be libertarians... how, consistent with libertarianism, can the government prohibit private individuals from exchanging pieces of paper saying ""I owe you 5 ounces of gold"", and force them to physically exchange the 5 ounces of gold instead? But if the government <i>doesn't</i> force them to physically exchange the gold, you have a money multiplier, and, in effect, privately minted fiat currency. And the related bubbles and crashes would also exist, as they have for centuries.",1266843628

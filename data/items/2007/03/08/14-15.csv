Managing all of those in a way that promotes collaboration towards a common goal is a fine art, as they certainly will not all be aligned. <p>This is what intrigues me about the Y combinator approach. Anyone with 50K can fund a couple of kids out of school and if the chemistry is right, the idea has some merit, and a dash of luck (hard work always brings some luck), it can fly.",1173364413

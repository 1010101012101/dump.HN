[a proposed abstract direction/plan]<p>A: ""Great!"" [means, I agree that's worth pursuing, let's see where it goes]<p>Q: ""I've made this logo treatment.""<p>A: ""Great!"" [Somewhat vague; definitely means I'm glad we've reached this point (regardless of the treatment quality), but might (if directly gesturing at the object) also imply some evaluative approval]<p>Q: ""How would you rate logo treatment #2?""<p>A: ""Great!"" [this finally really means it's evaluated as great on the relevant scale]<p>Even 'excellent', 'fantastic', and other adjectives are often used this same way: casually used to signal sufficient approval, when describing something prospectively/abstractly/directionally, but only being strong signals of judgement when applied to specific, concrete, completed instances.",1318219176

I think both sides need to focus less on the groups of people involved and just accept that big government and big corporations are not a healthy mix. Big corporations actually don't mind a big government because regulation can work in their favor to make it harder on their smaller competitors, not to mention lobbying for special favors and direct assistance (e.g. guaranteed loans). Tea partiers should be more positive towards the political realities of a powerful government and their opponents should recognize the need for reforming entitlements and ineffective/wasteful departments, such as the Department of Education and Defense.<p>I wouldn't describe our situation as a potential ""Arab Spring/French Revolution"".

If someone&#x27;s attitude is too disruptive to the group, something has to change. Also, &quot;acting professional&quot; is more of a buffer to try to keep people&#x27;s emotions from going too over the top.

6050414,comment,6049873,6050287,5,0,ivan444,,,"As the author of TextTeaser noted, there are two approaches to automatic summarization: abstraction and extraction.<p>Abstraction combines huge portions of two young research fields -- NLP & NLG (Natural Language Processing & Generation). NLG is even harder than NLP, and less researched. Without good NLG algorithm for presenting summary, you can&#x27;t have more humane summaries.<p>Extraction simply takes sentences (or some portions of them), ranks them and presents a few best results.<p>Two years ago, I was at presentation of PhD about text summarization. There I&#x27;ve figured out that you can make fair summarization algorithm in a few hours. Here is an prototype:
<a href=""https://bitbucket.org/ivan444/textsum/src/1d09b0f4f72a60903d91236ad77e8a5d5f5ce864/prototype.py?at=default"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/ivan444/textsum/src/1d09b0f4f72a60903d...</a>
Dirty prototype code, it took me just about 10h of work to prepare dataset, think algorithm, write program and tune it (this works only for Croatian language, if you want other language, you&#x27;ll need to get list of function words for that language -- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_word"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_word</a> ).
There is also java version of text summarizer (somewhere in repository) and simple tool to get clean, article-only text from any page containing some longer texts (it isn&#x27;t tuned well, I didn&#x27;t spent more than 1h of work in it, so I don&#x27;t expect it works well).<p>Algorithm is simple:
(1) break text into sentences, (2) extract features, (3) calc features score and sum them, (4) present ranked sentences (and, later, choose a few best).<p>Used features: normalized number of words, type of sentence (declarative, interrogative, exclamatory), order score (give first sentence a boost, as usually first sentence is the most important one), ratio between number of function words and all words (function words are words without semantic content; there is a fwords.txt in a repository which contains ~700 Croatian function words), normalized sum of three minimum TF-IDF scores (document = sentence).<p>I don&#x27;t know the state of the code (it is more than a year old code), but anyone is free to use that code for anything they like.",1373959457

[1] As soon as they see something addressed to a known WL address they will trace it back, find where it was sent from, find out the serial number of the sd card, get the shop where it was bought, etc. You wouldn&#x27;t want that kind of attention. And if you don&#x27;t have a private channel to WL you could only use their public addresses by definition, which would be guaranteed to be heavily monitored.<p>This is why I consider a working public steganography protocol so important. Using a very short message you could arrange the sd card to be dropped at some random place and know that somebody would come back in a couple of days to retrieve it. Encoded with ordinary simple text, using messages of typical lengths on popular, public websites. There are just too little bits of encoded information there to be statistically significant.<p>I&#x27;m not so worried about statistical analysis of how natural sounding or typical or expected the text you&#x27;re producing is, as it would be a very difficult problem considering it requires a good understanding of natural languages to be done well automatically. What would be really problematic is that WL may very well be infiltrated and the private key compromised.

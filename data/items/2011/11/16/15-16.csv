I'm hugely in favor of developers writing and optimizing their own SQL, being able to create normalized schema (and know when it's worth the tradeoff to denormalize), how to read a query plan, and generally be as competent as a DBA.  But... it's good to have one person who has the global view of the database for things like tuning extent sizes, selecting the optimal types of storage for various partions, doing reviews on the schema, capacity planning, etc, etc.<p>The right setup (IMO) of having a DBA in an operational role with developers that are highly proficient/self-sufficient is hard to get right and expensive enough that it probably isn't right for an early stage company.  And a bad DBA can be a nightmare.  So there are tradeoffs on both sides.",1321458950

After some Googling I realised that the side switch was in mute-mode, rather than rotation lock mode.<p>Why did I have to set someone elses iPad up in the first place? Because in a bandwidth-constrained country, downloading iTunes is a difficult problem - the stupid iTunes switch-on requirement has sunk many people (I've had to set up 3 iPads for other people because of it).<p>As a South African, I'm forced to create a Kenya iTunes account to buy games, since Apple hasn't bothered, like most other manufacturers have, to get a simple clearance from our Home Affairs department to self-rate games. At least creating a Kenya account is easier than the other ""workaround"": creating a US account with a fake address, and then buying iTunes vouchers. Of course, there is the risk that Apple will deactivate my account and screw me out of the apps I paid for.<p>Talking about having a Kenya account, I made the mistake of creating a South Africa account first - ever tried updating apps when you have multiple iTunes accounts?

So for LiveDrive to offer a useful service to these customers they'd have to undertake to continue to provide access to the backups for some extended period of time. Without that kind of undertaking the backup data is not worth very much - the user would be running the risk that their hard drive goes pop the day after LiveDrive finally decide to end supporting the old Backify users.<p>Another way of looking at it: if I've just done a routine backup of my machine through Backify, downloading all that data again is probably the last thing I want to do (unless my machine just blew up).

We got away with using singly-linked lists (FIFO queues) as the only shared data structure that needed to be lock-free. In that case, you trade one lock for one compare-and-swap, so there it's an even trade. The main path of the allocation was free of synchronization.<p>I also implemented a lock-free radix tree (the original was borrowed from TCMalloc), and you can see multiple compare-and-swap operations in the main routine (<a href=""https://github.com/scotts/streamflow/blob/master/streamflow.c#L395"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scotts/streamflow/blob/master/streamflow....</a>), but they will be hit only rarely.<p>I applied your reasoning, though. The fast path for allocation and freeing small objects was usually synchronization free, and always lock-free. But I protected my page manager with spin locks. The page manager was responsible for grabbing pages from the OS, giving them back to the OS, and carving out pages for individual threads to use as their backing store for their small object allocations. My rationale was that we would only hit the page manager rarely, and in that case, it would probably be <i>faster</i> to use a spin lock, since I anticipated getting pages from the page manager would usually be uncontended.<p>But that was back in 2005 and 2006. We only had access to 8 thread machines. The SFMalloc paper makes it lock-free all the way up the stack, and their experiments of up to 48 cores shows significant improvement.",1321457381

Not just as far as the medical questions go (e.g. what's a safe exposure level), but just standard engineering stuff.<p>For example, since backscatter machines work by scanning a narrow beam very quickly over the body, a particularly problematic failure mode would be the beam remaining energized but failing to move, which would give a very high localized dose. Even if that ""can't happen"", you would typically have some sort of failsafe that should rapidly cut off the beam in that case. If this were a medical device, there are fairly well established ways of doing failure-mode analysis to quantify that risk and the reliability/speed of the failsafes. Have companies like Rapiscan done that?",1321456455

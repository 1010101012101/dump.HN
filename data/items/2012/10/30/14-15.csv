4717580,comment,4717407,4717523,5,0,dctoedt,,,"> <i>But the default legal rules include protection, yes?</i><p>1.  Without a contractual disclaimer of 'consequential' damages [1], Zappos could find itself forced to defend against exorbitant claims for such damages --- and disputes about the underlying facts will usually mean that such claims would have to be resolved via an expensive and uncertain jury trial, as opposed to being disposed of on summary judgment [2] by the trial judge.<p>2.  Different states have different degrees of legal protection for businesses.  A brick-and-mortar store generally will be sued only in the jurisdiction where the store in question is located (or a chain might be sued at the location of its headquarters or other, limited venues) [3]. On the other hand, Zappos could be vulnerable to being sued just about anywhere a customer places an order --- the rules about 'personal jurisdiction' are a little fuzzy when it comes to Web sites [4].<p>So by not having contractual protections, Zappos arguably is exposing itself to the vagueries of whatever the default legal rules happen to be, in whatever state an unhappy consumer happens to live in.<p>3.  The actual business risk to Zappos might not be terrifying here, because the potential harm to consumers from buying an ill-fitting pair of shoes seems manageable (although Zappos does carry more than just shoes). It might be a different story for other e-commerce Web sites. So the object lesson of the Zappos case is worth heeding.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequential_damages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequential_damages</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_judgment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_judgment</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_jurisdiction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_jurisdiction</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_jurisdiction_in_Internet_cases_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_jurisdiction_in_Intern...</a>",1351609071

The point is that terms of use statement on a website does not constitute a contract because there is no meeting of the minds and no assent from both sides. Moreover, judges don't accept a unilateral statement that that terms can change at any time. Hence, Zappos' TOS was found to not be a legal contract.<p>The linked-to article says ""Zappos governed by the default legal rules, which aren't nearly as favorable to it. Losing its contract provisions meant Zappos is legally naked.""<p>Naked means unprotected, correct? But the default legal rules include protection, yes? So naked here can only be a euphemism, rather like in the first warm days of spring where I go outside without a coat and feel 'naked' because I'm missing clothing that I expected. Zappos has protections, just not the protection that it wants. This isn't ""naked.""<p>Yet I get the feeling that the author believes that the management provisions that Zappos had in its TOS (""its disclaimer of warranties, its waiver of consequential damages, its reduced statute of limitations, its clause restricting class actions in arbitration"") are almost morally necessary.

4717509,comment,4716120,4716120,10,0,michaelochurch,,,"""Celebrity"" is a clumsy metaphor for this because most <i>celebrities</i> are made by behind-the-scenes executives and agents who have a lot of power. Celebrities are mostly made products. Establishing independent credibility is something else. It's not outsized fame, but it's still enough of a force that companies are beginning to see it as dangerous.<p>Thirty years ago, companies held all the cards, because credibility came from job titles and references that only a hand-picked class of stewards called ""managers"" could hand out, then managed to convince the peasants that it was ""unethical"" to play out-of-band (by having a friend give a reference as manager, or upgrading a title). If they wanted to reduce a target's career credibility to zero, they could do so. They could fire that person and give a terrible reference and call the person ""disgruntled"" if he said anything bad about them. They could even reduce the employee's job title and fail to acknowledge that he held the higher one at any time: their word against his. The only recourse an employee had was to sue the employer, which is mutually assured destruction at best, because even winning a termination suit is usually bad for a person's career.<p>Companies could also bring ruin upon people who spoke the truth about them, so almost no one did, and this kept their pristine organizational reputations (and thus, their credibility) intact.<p>We're moving toward a different sort of economy in which these middlemen are losing their hold. The one-sided expectation of ""professionalism"" (companies can be abusive, but employees and exes are expected to keep their interests and secrets no matter what) is ending. It's a very good thing, but it's scary for corporations because they've lost control of information, and because it's not hard to make recruiting just enough harder to cost the company more than, say, a 6- to 12-month severance (which is extremely generous, at least in the U.S.) would cost.",1351607997

On the surface the narrative seems plausible as that of a press event. In depth, it is not.<p>Forestall cashed out his shares in May, more than a month before the release of the Maps app was announced and almost five months before the letter of apology. Usually, when a senior executive cashes out, it is a clear statement that the direction of the company is such that it no longer appears to be a wise investment - it expresses a loss of faith in the company.<p><a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57425920-37/apple-exec-scott-forstall-sells-off-95-percent-of-his-shares/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57425920-37/apple-exec-sco...</a><p>What I find interesting in this officially unofficial narrative is what its truth would imply about Apple's leadership. In an a distorted reality where Forstall signed the letter rather than Cook, consumers would have said, ""Who's that?""<p>More importantly, Wall Street would have said, ""Who's in charge?"" Forstall would have been taking on the responsibility as the face of Apple, and Cook would have looked ineffectual as a leader by failing to take responsibility.<p>A letter bearing Forstall's signature would be a clear statement that he was so vital to Apple's future that he was allowed to atone for such a grave error rather than being summarily sacked. It would have made it nearly impossible to fire him, because of the contradictory signals leadership would be sending.<p>So I doubt the narrative. I doubt that Apple's leadership is so inept as to have considered anyone but Cook signing a letter. I doubt that Cook is so inept as to not seriously consider not apologizing. I doubt that anyone at Apple is so naive as to have misunderstood what Forstall's stock sale meant.<p>I believe the truth is simple.<p>At his level, it's pretty much up or out for ""Type A personalities."" Forstall did not succeed Jobs as CEO. Six months after Job's death, he sold his stock. A year later he publicly took the fall for Maps. In return, Apple lets 75,000 options vest while he advises Cook over the next year. By signing the apology, Cook looks compassionate to consumers. By sacking Forstall, he looks decisive to Wall Street.<p>The officially unofficial narrative serves it's purpose. It's more interesting than one about a negotiated severance package and the implementation of a succession plan.<p>And by getting the media to accuse him of acting Jobsian, Forstall displays a Jobsian brilliance. I suspect there is already a queue of companies seeking him as CEO.",1351606562

4717356,comment,4715829,4717107,6,0,timmyd,,,"I think is an unrealistic approach.<p>Most people cram for exams and leave it all to the last minute - that's life. So in juxtaposing such a common example - I will generalize and assume a lot of people do the same for just about anything else. It's not some crazy ideology - it's called being a human being. Factors outside someone's control shouldn't mean they should be punished for something that everyone does everyday or has done at some time. No one is perfect, people make mistakes and entrepreneurs more than anyone - that's the beauty of it. However, this isn't some exam - it's an application to find great people, great ideas and amazing companies.<p>The suggestion from your comment is that great people hit deadlines ""no matter what"". I couldn't disagree more. Running a startup is about elasticity - not ""no matter what"". If someone has spent weeks getting their video just right - after doing 1000x iterations of it because they wanted to reach the submission date by 30th ""no matter what"" but then some act of god comes along - it's fair that it destroys their chance ?<p>That makes no sense - they were going to hit the deadline according to your logic but now something has come along and destroyed that. The ""no matter what"" is now irrelevant - its time to be flexible, compassionate and understanding. Walk a mile in their shoes for just one second.<p>The world we live in is not some crystallized inflexible place and YC is not either - if your idea fails, start another. I, for one, hope that someone amazing comes along because they were allowed to submit after the fact. That's what entrepreneurship is all about - people.<p>""More than machinery we need humanity; More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.

The client can add stories at any stage, and set the priority in the backlog at any time.  They just can't change the current sprint's stories and priorities.  That way they can make as many changes as they want, and the impact of those changes are always visible.<p>Why limit the client to an arbitrary number of changes (like 2 in this example?)  The whole idea of Agile development is that we cannot know everything in the beginning, so we spec as much as we can in the beginning, and leave room to change our minds at a later stage.<p>Of course, we explain this way of working up front as well, and we make the benefits clear to the client.  They have to buy into this before we start with anything.  It works very well when they do buy in though.",1351605846

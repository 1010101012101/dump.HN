2349658,comment,2347698,2347832,0,0,bradleyland,,,"I didn't down vote you, but I do disagree (disagree != downvote).<p>I live in a small town called Vero Beach, FL. Vero Beach is split in to two parts by the Intercoastal Waterway (locally known as the Indian River). The mainland portion of the city is lower than average in many regards. Most relevant to the situation at hand, we have a lower than average median-income, and the vast majority of our college grads move on to other cities. Our primary local industries are service and hospitality. If you were to come here from out of town, you would characterize many of the mainland residents as ""rednecks"". You see plenty of pick-up trucks sporting all manner of window decals. Of course, we also have a very large immigrant population due to the local citrus industry, so you also have lots of people walking the streets in their white t-shirts, dirty jeans, and large hats. About a 3.5 mile drive puts you in the heart of Gifford, FL; a sister city to Vero Beach, but could not be more different. Gifford's population is 57.43% black according to the 2000 census. Contrast this to 92.73% white in Vero Beach. By many outward appearances, this area is stuck in the early 1900s. Stereotypes abound in Vero Beach.<p>Interestingly, if you cross the bridge to the barrier island, you'll find another divide; the income divide. The barrier island has its own zip code (32963), which just happens to have the highest concentration of retired CEOs in the nation. When I did local IT consulting (computer repair), I had the opportunity to do work for the former CEO of Warner Lambert, the current CEO of Textron, and a retired board member for Chevron, among others. You can't throw a stone without hitting a former or acting CEO in 32963. There is ample opportunity for poorer residents across the river to make off with lots of expensive goods from homes just a few miles away during a catastrophe. Add to that the fact that pretty much all of the residents on the beach side aren't here during the summer, so their homes are unattended, guarded by only a small local police force that is vastly outnumbered and very, very busy during emergencies.<p>In 2004, we were struck with back-to-back hurricanes (within three weeks). Many people lost their homes to flooding and water intrusion (the roof failed). There was only passing major media coverage, because the storm came ashore in a relatively low-population area, and there weren't a lot of houses leveled, so it didn't make good news. I can assure you, a house does not have to be leveled to the ground in order to be uninhabitable. Once you've had 18"" of river water in your house, you don't want to sleep there. Many went weeks without power, and gas (petrol) was unavailable for days, so while most families had supplies, there were plenty of people who couldn't last 10 days without electricity, gasoline, and food.<p>Through all of this, there was no mention of looting or increases in crime in Vero Beach. Quite the contrary. We had community run food banks and shelters that stayed open long after the worst had passed. Local landscape companies drove neighborhoods picking up debris without worrying about who will pay the bill, and sometimes it seemed like the whole town was actually grateful for what had happened. I've never felt a greater sense of community.<p>My point is that you don't need higher education in order to foster a culture that cares about people. To suggest otherwise is a dangerous cultural bias that infers elitism of the worst kind. Individuals derive their sense of attachment to their community in a variety of ways that often are not tied to any level of education or income.<p>So please, don't bother looking down your nose at us poor, uneducated, rednecks. We're not the ones in need of ""some good learnin'"" on the subject of community.<p>EDIT: Let me be more specific by separating concerns.<p>* I do agree that the overall response to the catastrophe in Japan is extremely honorable and is something we should strive for here in the US.<p>* I do agree that we lag behind in education and should strive to improve that.<p>* I strongly disagree that you should establish bias by correlating education, ""lack of culture"", and the predisposition to commit a crime.<p>* I strongly disagree that higher-education is the motivating factor behind the lack of looting in Japan.<p>* I strongly disagree that a lack of looting at a university has anything to do with their level of education, but more to do with the reasons they're there to become educated to begin with.",1300715977

The thing overly-PC types don't want to address is that certain fields attract certain types. Geeky males in tech, women and gay men in fashion, etc. The lack of population matching demographics isn't proof of racism.<p>That said, I'd argue that unless you grew up with computers and were interested in programming them early in life you probably aren't the startup type.  Your income level affects this, obviously if you can't get your hands on a computer then you're not going to be able to do much.  As a geek I never had any ""role models"" or other things that set me on my path. Nor did my parents encourage tech. Nor did my friends.

Later, however, the Belarusian government tried to soften him proposing him to get back a job in a state institute, ""at the condition that he would not work on Chernobyl anymore."" He escaped two assassination attempts.[1]<p>> Nesterenko intervened immediately after news of the accident in the nuclear power plant started to spread. As an expert on the subject and with his experience as a fire fighter, he threw liquid nitrogen containers from a helicopter on the burning reactor core. To do this he had to move into the middle of radioactive smoke. Despite the heavy radioactive contamination of the area, Nesterenko survived. However, of the four passengers of his helicopter, three died from radioactive irradiation and contamination.[1]",1300715864

Students will not learn pointers, they will not learn arrays. In fact, they'll not learn any of the difficulties of C. We both know the purpose of 213 isn't to teach you C. It's coded in C, but I think I used pointers in exactly 1 lab. The course won't teach you C and you can get by with C0 knowledge. Then when you get to OS, Distributed, etc, you will need to know the intricate details of a language you have no real experience in. At this point, why teach a useless language that gives no benefits to students? It is not any easier to learn than Java, yet much less useful.<p>Additionally, I never stated that its necessary for Java to be taught.

And currently what's happening is that the prerequisites are being removed from the cirriculum. Thus, unless people have knowledge of C, pointers, asm, people will be focusing on learning C during OS and not OS. We've both taken the course. We both know that a student who doesn't know C has a high probability of failure.<p>The point is, a student coming out of CMU will now only be required to know 3 languages: SML, OCaml, and C-naught. One of them is utterly useless. I do believe that a focus on functional programming is a good thing. What I don't support is pushing programming languages at the cost of everything else. A systems person or even an algorithms person can't thrive in the new cirriculum. Almost every required course is a PL course, or fundamentally tied to PL in some way.",1300715554

2349610,comment,2349170,2349170,0,0,thegeezer3,,,"Hi<p>Ive been studying Japanese for about 5 years now. I help out at the ruby kaigi here in Tokyo as well with translation. I'm by no means perfect and still have a long way to go but conversation is no problem. My reading is good enough to read blogs and to an extent magazines but novels is a different story ( I'm working on that). So that said here are my top tips:<p>1) Are you in this for the long haul? If you are then master learning and writing the kanji first of all. Dont worry, its not as hard as it seems. Your a hacker so your going to appreciate this book ""Remembering the Kanji"" by ""Heisig"". Use that book with a site called ""Reviewing the Kanji"". The author truly is a hacker, his methodology of learning the kanji is absolutely brilliant. I finished the book in 2 months and could write about 70% of those kanji from memory. By 6 months it was closer to 95%. I put this off and i regret this so much. I wasted two precious years of studying by holding this back. You learn so much more through reading. Listening too, but with reading you can control the pace.<p>2) Pour your heart into the above and then tackle hirigana and katakana. If you've come this far learning those will be a piece of cake.<p>3) Download anki - a vocab software that uses spaced repetitions ( based on the leitner system ).<p>4) Buy a good Japanese to english dictionary. The Green Godess is good one. A little over the top for a beginner as its aimed at translators but its full of example sentences. You wont need another dictionary for a long time, maybe ever (one day though you might want to look into a monolingual one for children)<p>5) Grab the Japanese Grammar reference books published by the Tokyo Times. there a set of 3. For now the first one will do. If you want to save money. Tim Kae's online reference is very good.<p>6) Start learning basic vocabulary and grammar from the above and using Anki to learn it.<p>7) You could do this by just diving into reading blogs online. Remember you can write a lot of kanji by now so those funny symbols wont be so alien. Use a firefox / chrome / iphone and ipad plug-in called Rikaichan. This allows you to hover your cursor over a word in Japanese and the meaning will pop-up. This is really good. Place any unknown words you really want to learn into anki along with its sentence. Use your dictionary and grammar reference to write notes on the meaning. Anki will then test you on this at various points in time, increasing the interval period to stretch your memory more and more.<p>8) When you review in Anki, dont just mentally check your comprehension, write out the words to improve your kanji writing and reading abilities. You'll be amazed at how common some kanji are. Its like the 80/20 rule except more like 60/40. Knowing 40% kanji pronunciations goes a long way.<p>9) Have fun doing this. Find new words and grammar through the things you love. I do it through reading ruby books, techcrunch.jp, engadget.jp and a host of other famous Japanese websites. If you want to find interesting stuff go Japan's version of delicious called hatena.<p>10) Don't let not being in the country hold you back. There are ways to create your own environment if you try. My Japanese friend found Western roommates and his English has skyrocketed. Try the same in your neck of the woods. Rent lots of Japanese classics, cook from Japanese cooking boks ( cookpad.com ), learn japanese folk songs to sing at karaoke ( search for lyrics online ), build a gundam model using the Japanese instructions, read Ryan Bates Railscasts transcripts in Japanese over at asciicasts ...you get the idea.<p>11) Search for the language learning forum -  I cant remember the name but its big and full of great advice.<p>12) Above all make it fun!<p>good luck!",1300715375

For names in particular, they are sometimes transcribed in a more phonetic way, trying to capture how people actually pronounce them in, say, Libya or Morocco or Egypt; and other times are transcribed in a more structural/etymological way based on the spelling, following one of the schemes for transcribing the Arabic alphabet into English, which are usually based on Modern Standard Arabic.<p>Greek has a version of the same variation, despite not having modern-day diglossia and being mostly associated with one country, because of the ancient/modern relationship. For example, the large peninsula in southern Greece, Χαλκιδική, is spelled: Halkidiki, Halkithiki, Halkidhiki, Chalcidice, Chalcidiki, Khalkidhiki, Chalkidike, etc. Some of the transliterations attempt to capture how it's pronounced in modern Greek (Halkidiki is close, but Khalkidhiki captures some of the nuance better if you know what the 'kh' and 'dh' sounds are supposed to be), others try to transcribe the Greek alphabet using one of the standard schemes for either ancient or modern Greek (Chalcidice is the classic transliteration), and others do some mixture.<p>People tend to have strong opinions as well; classicists and etymologists don't like the obscuring of spelling that the phonetic transcriptions produce, but Greeks wince at people pronouncing Halkidiki as if it started with the English word ""chalk"" and ended with ""dice"". I imagine many Arabs similarly favor the more phonetic spellings for their names.",1300714911

2349569,comment,2347698,2347698,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"One important note: <i>most</i> Americans are honest and some will go well out of their way to do the right thing. I think there's actually more of the latter (people going well out of their way to help others) in the U.S. than in many other countries. If you lose something in the U.S. and there's a way for a person who finds it to return it to you, your odds are well above 50% of getting it back. Possibly 90%. This number is pretty constant across racial and geographic lines. Oddly enough, measured honestly rates tend to be slightly lower at the socioeconomic top and bottom than in the middle. At the bottom, it's because of economic desperation. At the top, it's because people are so used to a sense of winning and entitlement that they enjoy ""beating the system"". I'd argue that, at all levels, class-based resentments are the reason for lower levels of honesty among Americans.<p>Japan has something much closer to a ""middle-class society"" or classlessness than we do. They have rich and poor, but not in the way we do, and economic status doesn't persist over generations as in the U.S. For example, the earthquake victims are in for a very difficult few years-- more difficult than most people in the industrialized world ever experience-- but they're not going to fall to the bottom of society because of this. In the U.S., they easily could. I know PhDs in the U.S. who end up in $7/hour retail jobs after developing health problems, losing their jobs, their insurance, and their savings.<p>The biggest difference in the U.S. is that we have a large, angry underclass that (justly) considers itself failed by society and hates it. We also have a tiny but invincible upper class that gets away with literal robbery and tends to set the moral pace in our society: kids in academic cheating scandals generally say they're just preparing for the real world, and they're more accurate than we'd like to admit. ""Most people cheat"" is false, but ""most of society's biggest winners are cheaters"" is true.<p>I think the contempt for society and ethical behavior that you see in a visible few Americans is based in social class, not anything else. Every society has poor people, but our underclass comprises 20-40 percent of the population. It has a mix of people who've fallen into it recently (from the disintegrated bottom of the middle class) and who are angry, and it has families that have been in it for tens of generations and have been nurturing grudges forever. Also, not all looters and ruffians are in this underclass, because there are a lot of opportunistic middle-class people who adopt ""thug"" culture for kicks. In the U.S., we enable cultural illnesses (mean-spirited conservatism, religious bigotry, lower-class ""thug"" culture) that other societies have the sense of marginalize.",1300714819

This was the single most important thing to happen, since It reduced the heat generation virtually immediately, without which it it is highly likely that at least one would have lost containment prior to emergency measures of the last few days working.  The lack of graphite may have made that survivable for Japan, but the plant itself would have been virtually impossible to recover, and continuing failures would have been very, very bad for neighboring communities.

(You haven't heard of Daini in about a week because we've reestablished control there.) It wiped out their diesel generators and external power lines, because both had tolerances in the five to six meter range for tsunamis and the actual wVe was nine to ten.<p>Things, incredibly, still didn't go to pot immediately.  They worked on battery backup for a few hours, but couldn't get an emergency plan in operation in time without power.  That's when things started to get bad, principally with overheating from waste heat causing radioactive steam/hydrogen explosions, which were the first cause of radioactivity spikes and have complicated all the disaster response since.

2349530,comment,2346590,2348409,0,0,anamax,,,"> This conversion does not sound so trivial to me generally. At times converting from a dynamic language to a statically typed language requires either a change of code architecture or a massive refactoring operation.<p>I didn't claim that it was necessarily trivial.  However, I'm happy to claim that it is very rarely required.  What is it that they say about premature optimization?<p>That said, I think that you're overstating the amount of work.  As our python friends keep demonstrating, the amount of code that is actually performance-critical is usually fairly small and can be handled by special means once you get things relatively stable.<p>And, when it is required, it may be an indication of massive success.  If you wrote the first version, said massive success may make the conversion someone else's problem.  :-)<p>> Not corrects, just detects. I have at times faced issues when code runs for half-an-hour and then crashes just because a the given object could not be converted to the needed new type at run-time. My reaction: ""Sigh! I wish the compiler told me earlier during compile-time!""<p>No optimization produces speedups in every situation.<p>As to that particular problem, I develop in dynamic languages so I ""never"" have that problem after a significant amount of run-time.<p>To me, it's important to remember that dynamically and statically typed languages give you different rope with which to hang yourself, so it's best to program with that in mind.<p>To put it another way, it is generally agreed that it's a bad idea to write fortran in other languages even though it is possible.  Why would you think that it would be a good idea to write static in a dynamic language or the reverse?",1300713930

Then Apple decides to build the same functionality right into the phone making the app obsolete. That's a much better analogy.<p>Now I'm not against Apple doing that at all. In fact I think it's a no-brainer, and failing to do it would be disappointing. It's just a shame that the little indy guys who created that market for them get shut out. Toss them a couple million bucks or something you know?",1300712732

There are so many .net developers out there working a corporate job that WP7 become the obvious choice for when you need to outfit your 10,000 insurance claim adjustors with a phone.<p>I'd love to see it take off in the consumer space because it has such great tooling, but I don't think it'll have the same market share as iOS or Android.",1300712515

489885,comment,489788,489849,0,0,unalone,,,"This right here is worth repeating. Never pick something you're certain you can do. Go for things just out of your reach. Pick things that you're going to have to strain to do. Do this again and again, and every time you get a bit better.<p>Occasionally, attempt something far beyond your reach, just to remind yourself of what you're striving for.",1235231644

One of the best snippets of characterization I've seen on the Internet is awhile:<p><i>We gave the man a nod and ""Hey"" as we walked to our table and were soon whispering back and forth like 12 year old girls at the 7th grade dance.<p>""You go talk to him"" I said, while tugging nervously on my dress.
""No, you go talk to him"" Sean replied while flipping his hair.</i><p>--------<p><i>""He ordered like 20 dollars worth of food"" the kid stammered out, obviously thrilled to be talking about it, ""And he left me a 160 dollar tip. Then he asked for a Sprite and gave me forty bucks for it.""</i><p>On a side note, I've sometimes wondered how much celebrities' aptness to tip their servers is correlated to their being recognized.",1235231305

It reflects the human mind, as well as the human condition, and has already been shown to be less than universal (i.e. that there are true statements which cannot be arrived at via method of proof given axioms).<p>Human mathematical intercourse is generally couched in cliche (since most humans aren't particularly fluent), and is shot through with concepts that other advanced civilizations are likely to find violently stupid (e.g. infinity).",1235230967

This is because I am not obsessed over religion (or lack thereof) and I treat everyone with respect (i.e. I am not a foaming around the mouth atheist).<p>Most atheists on reddit are extreme, annoying and post the same article and the same old comments over and over again. They are incapable of any rational thought - if you even dare to point out the good things that a religious group does you are downmodded and ridiculed (e.g. the catholic church's network of hospitals in 3rd world countries).<p>It is the same with the GOP-bashing articles. I am not american and I do not support GWB â€“ but they go to far with their bashing and I sincerely doubt of the sanity of most redditors.",1235230964

Too many people believe this and end up losing a lot of money.<p>To see why it's nonsense, suppose there is one red slot, one black slot, and 98 green slots on a roulette wheel. Then suppose you can bet on red or black, and the payoff is 1:1.<p>Clearly this is heavily biased against you, and there's no way you can win.<p>Now apply the method given in the post above.  Each time you lose you double your bet, and eventually you win.  Now you're $1 in front over all, and start again.  Each time you win (1 in 100 on average) you gain $1 overall.<p>You can't lose!<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system)</a>",1235230568

We will try and improve the registration procedure, and also the feedback to users as regarding why load tests are denied (often, it is because some resource used on your site have been used by a lot of other sites aswell, and our system doesn't want to strain that particular resource/object - but we have to be clearer about this).<p>Employees and industry is there for us to learn who our customers/users are. This is a new type of service, and we need information on who are target audience are, because we frankly don't know that yet. These values are optional to fill in, though. Should we be more informative, maybe, and tell people that we will absolutely not under any circumstances give out information about them to a third party - would that reassure you?<p>Finally, your confirmation email might have been delayed as there was a DNS issue yesterday that caused outgoing email to be queued for a while.

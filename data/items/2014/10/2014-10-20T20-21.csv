First, we haven&#x27;t figured out how to distribute wealth and prestige in such a society, and we haven&#x27;t figured out how to be a society where wealth and prestige don&#x27;t matter. Second, we haven&#x27;t figured out what most people will actually <i>do</i> in such a society, and while some of the possibilities are good things like familial, creative, and scientific endeavors, many are bad things like violence and sloth.<p>I&#x27;m all for it, if we can figure out some solutions to these issues!",1413838771

The automatic bread machine of this generation?<p>I actually quite enjoy my bread machine.  My wife and I both work and are active in our community.  It&#x27;s extremely wonderful to spend 5 minutes before bed and have bread in the morning.  It&#x27;s cheaper than buying bread at the store (ok, the 50¢ loaves give it a run for it&#x27;s money), and we know exactly whats in it.<p>Once this comes down in price, which it or something like it will, to the point where it&#x27;s a few hundred I can see it being used in much the same way by many folks: Good beer is expensive. OK beer is cheap. Home-machine-made beer is better than OK and cheaper.",1413838755

In the Netherlands there&#x27;s now a discussion flaring up again about what looks like an assassination by the Dutch army of a group of Moluccan hijackers looking to bring independence for their people (part of Dutch colony Indonesia shifting towards independence).<p>One salient fact that arose recently is the use of hollow point bullets.<p>Why is this controversial? Because for incapacitation, not assassination, regular bullets would apparently have been more effective.

I&#x27;ve found myself that being hungry or tired makes the whole world seem darker, gloomy, and less ... doable.  It unraveling this thread helped me realize that i came up with a lot fewer random ideas for businesses when I was hungry.

Because in almost 15 years of investing, fundamental research, and technical analysis [edit: and associated community participation, consumption of research products, and reading investment literature and publications] I have not seen anyone take issue with calling a 3-year low on a stock on the basis of an intraday low. It&#x27;s a 3 year low. I didn&#x27;t say that was particularly important, but it&#x27;s true by any reasonable definition of the term (which is a common one).

Now it looks to me like they try to handle the hwrng as something that can be actively malicious, not just having a known seed (while just having the known seed, to my understanding, shouldn&#x27;t be a problem to mix together with with other inputs). I personally think that the assumption of active maliciousness is to much, because the same company produces the whole CPU, and if you assume that, then you shouldn&#x27;t use the CPU at all: they can be actively malicious all the time, not just with one instruction.<p>And, by the way, mixing through the same path but without increasing the &quot;entropy counter&quot; were maybe possible, but maybe it was cleaner this way.",1413837803

Furthermore, just because the strength of the emotion is easily detectable in one person, doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it is as perceivable by another person. What allows a person to perceive emotions has to do with how well they have trained their awareness to pay attention to emotions rather than either ignoring them, or avoiding them.<p>Hunger itself isn&#x27;t an emotion. It&#x27;s a complex of physical sensations. However, in most people, it is highly coupled with various emotional responses. Hunger is one of the first things an infant experiences, often coupled with being fed by a parent and loved upon. It&#x27;s not accident that a lot of people (not everyone) eat more when they are stressed. (Comfort food). I have seen otherwise mature adults regressed to childhood, infantile behaviors because they skipped a meal.<p>It&#x27;s actually a fairly immature understanding of emotions to associate poor emotional control or behaviors with the level of maturity. Your ability to handle emotions has more to do with whether you fully pay attention to the emotions and process them out.

8484177,comment,8478427,8479062,0,0,AlyssaRowan,,,"Hmmm… and ElGamal&#x27;s signing scheme didn&#x27;t qualify? I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a reason, or even an excuse: Schnorr actually <i>did</i> claim his patent read on DSA. (That obviously never went anywhere, and the US Government, in a show of force via the NSA, filed their own patent on DSA.)<p>The NSA also really doesn&#x27;t seem to have had much of a problem negotiating the licensing of patents with industry participants in the past! It is, after all, in an extraordinarily strong bargaining position: an <i>awful lot</i> of public money to throw around (openly, via on-the-book government contracts, and otherwise); the backing of a &#x27;superpower&#x27; government and its negotiators; a remarkably good idea of what the position of those its bargaining with is (it <i>is</i> a signals intelligence agency…!); and is even able to <i>classify</i> patents and other nonsense like that.<p>DSA was sceptically received at the time, and there was widespread suspicion about its complexity and critical dependency on random k. (Even just two or three predictable leading bits of k can cause disaster!) Sizes above 1024 bit were not specified for way too long, and I would consider a 1024-bit DSA key <i>most definitely</i> crackable by the computing resources available to the NSA (or perhaps anyone else with a budget and a chip fab on contract after-hours!) today. (Those with DSA PGP signing keys may wish to take note and replace them, I suggest, with 4096-bit RSA keys.)<p>I think perhaps the only reason DSA got any popularity was because of the RSA patent, which it wasn&#x27;t subject to, and the US cryptographic export restrictions which were the style at the time (remember the PGP source code &quot;type-in listing&quot; book publication?), which DSA avoided ostensibly because you couldn&#x27;t encrypt with it but mainly because the US Government wanted you to use it. (ElGamal&#x27;s encryption scheme was commonly used in tandem with it in practice, for example by some PGP versions.)<p>ECDSA has been accepted in a more sanguine fashion overall, although I&#x27;m not sure why that has been. Just like DSA, it definitely works correctly <i>if</i> it&#x27;s done properly - but one tiny slip and you&#x27;re toast.<p>Why was ECDSA better-received than DSA? Time may have helped; so is what they were seen to have done in the meantime. &quot;Suite B-eatification&quot; (as Kevin put it!) I think might&#x27;ve made people a little less sceptical of the NSA&#x27;s intentions overall; also SHA (which as far as we know is <i>not</i> backdoored and has never been), and (via NIST) their arms-length involvement in reviewing candidates for the AES process. That introduced its &quot;Information Assurance&quot; mission (the one to protect classified US Government data - anyone else&#x27;s data, or unclassified US Government data, is Not Their Problem). With Suite B, they wanted to be able to use more off-the-peg commercial providers for that purpose (rather than their bespoke, if a bit <i>haute couture</i> weird and distinctly old-looking, in-house stuff, which they referred to by contrast as &quot;Suite A&quot;). And people - perhaps foolishly - trusted that, despite the &quot;equity&quot; tension between their two missions, they would never risk compromising the same encryption systems they&#x27;d use for top secret US Government data. (It appears that trust may have been sadly misplaced… and, thanks to Snowden&#x27;s bold willingness to go on-the-record about their unethical actions, they have <i>permanently</i> destroyed that trust now.)<p>We can, indeed, do better now, happily. I wonder if we will?<p>This talk was a fun &quot;thinking-like-the-enemy&quot; thought experiment, interlaced with the kinds of things djb&#x27;s been generally warning about for years - I think it&#x27;s up on YouTube somewhere, and like many slides makes more sense with the talk, although I sadly can&#x27;t find it now (and I recall the audio quality wasn&#x27;t great).<p>Along similar lines, someone down below has helpfully pointed out the fantastic &quot;Operation ORCHESTRA&quot; briefing PHK gave at FOSDEM 2014, which is equally funny and pointed.

The automatic bread machine of this generation?<p>For that price tag you aren&#x27;t going to get people who want to test out homebrewing. My first homebrew setup was ~$150. This included two buckets (fermentor and bottling), kettle for boiling the wort and hops, bottles, basic bottling accessories, and my first extract kit (fat tire clone).<p>On the other side they claim this is a professional tool. However, I would highly doubt any real brewery would use this. They have their own pilot systems where they typically make 20-50 gallon test batches. The output of 2.5 gallons is no where near ideal for a test batch. A gallon of beer gets you roughly 10 (12 oz) bottles.<p>I&#x27;m not quite sure who their market actually is.

I agree with you that publishers are not necessarily beat.<p>But you can&#x27;t wave away the power Amazon has in that fight. The number of businesses that can survive, say, a 50% drop in sales for a year is pretty darn small, and the number of businesses that will tolerate a 50% drop in sales for six months without tossing out the CEO is even smaller. That means Amazon has a <i>lot</i> of power right now to decide how practically every supplier in the book market behaves.

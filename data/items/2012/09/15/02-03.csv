4525097,comment,4522650,4523368,2,0,lsllc,,,"If you ask nicely, AT&T will upgrade every year -- they have for me.  They'll tell you about the ""early upgrade fee"" ($250), so just ask them what your current early termination fee is -- it'll be less (that's why they raised it last year).<p>So you pay the ETF and switch to Verizon.  If you got the 4S last year, you're looking at $215 right now for an ETF vs $250 for the ""early upgrade fee"".  Chances are, they want to retain you as a customer, so they'll waive the upgrade fee.<p>I certainly don't feel bad for AT&T, my average monthly bill is $130, so I'm paying them ~$1600 in monthlies per year plus the annual $200 (& change!) upgrade fee.  So I don't think it's unreasonable to get a new $650 iPhone each year for the $2K I'm paying (which as you say probably only costs them $350).<p>I just wish they'd formalize this into a ""Apple fanboi"" plan so I don't have to threaten to cancel, argue with managers etc to get that shiny new phone on release day!<p>Full disclosure: I do sell the previous phone via eBay, so I guess I'm at least making the $200 upgrade fee back.",1347677967

That's why people have mentors, people with decades of life experience to learn from.<p>""Learn to distinguish between people who treat you well because they respect you, and people who treat you well because you're running half their business for an intern-salary.""<p>Perhaps that is something you did not learn in your youth, but you should know that does not mean that those of similar youth age don't realize that. Personally, this was a point I exploited when I ran my business. Having interns that were years older than me doing work for me. Quite ""amusing"", as you point out, now that I think back...<p>Nevertheless, I think your advice is true. Lots of people out to take advantage of young people. This is not new, though and anyone with the level of experience in business having done work previously in youth years would know this.<p>The pattern that I've noticed is most people will speak similar to you.

So many people, even those closest to me, never believed (and still do not) or understood what you have so beautifully and artfully articulated. Reading what you wrote, I could relate to your every sentiment. People think that just because of an age, we lack the ability to create and provide amazing things. It works against us, beyond the cute factor, and it is seemingly a constant pressure and embarrassment that we have no hold over. Then, even in our best moments, people will question what weve done and dismiss it as nothing more than an exercise. Its aggravating, frustrating and depressing. But then well have those amazing experiences where we meet adults that understand this and they treat us like equals. Our opinion, expertise, and passion weigh so much more than a number. The level of gratification from meeting these people, to know that there are others that accept the results we produce, is simply awe-inspiring.<p>Among my circle of friends back in High School, I can think of only a select few who I can confide with these thoughts. Its so difficult trying to find someone that really understands these kinds of struggles- the dismissive remarks, the attitude of negativity and failure, etc that people give when they find out your age.<p>Thank You for sharing your post with HN. To know that someone else is out there who truly understands these trials and struggles makes me feel just a bit less lonely  to know that Im not the only one who feels that way about entrepreneurship.

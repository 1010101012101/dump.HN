My phone & MBP can both wirelessly communicate with devices half way around the globe, yet they need a special USB cord to talk to each other?<p>Plus, more than 50% of iPhone users never even bother syncing with a computer after the initial activation.

2721474,comment,2716714,2716714,2,0,bborud,,,"In security the most important thing you can teach people is to be aware when things are harder than they look so they'll take a bit of extra time educating themselves and talking to other people.<p>Learning how to separate good from bad advice is a skill that needs to be maintained.  Also, in all software that is supposed to provide some form of security, one has to be prepared for the eventuality that it probably contains errors.<p>I used to read a lot of books on cryptography and the use of cryptography.  I've forgotten most of it by today, and to be quite frank:  the more I know, the less I want to write crypto software.  There is something deeply unsatisifying about work where you know that what will in all likelihood trip you up is some trivial, stupid mistake.<p>It isn't hard because of the crypto itself.  Sure, certain cryptographic libraries can be extremely awkward to use (which in itself is a security risk),  but the problem usually comes from where you aren't looking for them.<p>I cringe a bit when people advertise software as being secure because it uses this or that encryption scheme.  I also cringe when people claim that they ""encrypt databases"" and their systems are therefore secure -- because, for most usage scenarios, I can't think of any really secure way of doing this.  Not without compromises anyway. And while I honestly know that I have just a rudimentary grasp on cryptography, I know a lot more about it than most people who make products that hinge upon correct application of crypto.<p>Just the other day I was trying to determine how many rounds I wanted to use in bcrypt for storing passwords for a given system. I think I spent most of the day pondering this question, writing benchmarks and reading up on what other people said on the topic.  \nA couple of days later a friend of mine emailed me a code snippet that implemented the password hashing scheme of a commercial product they use that makes shameless claims about being secure.  (I think he probably just looked at the hashed passwords and made a guess about the method they had used.  I don't think he had a look at the original source code).  If memory serves the product uses unsalted SHA1 hashing.  In other words, the vendor didn't even bother thinking about the problem.<p>What scares me a bit is that even I thought ""well, if they claim to have well thought-out password handling and they are in the business of selling security systems, I suppose they have probably given this a lot of thought"" the first time I visited their website.  After all, large companies give them millions.  Right?<p>I wonder what other things they are doing equally badly.",1309605761

Thunder Craft Boats</i> [1], in which the Court unanimously struck down <i>as unconstitutional</i> a Florida statute prohibiting plug-mold copying of boat hulls.  The Court said, in part, that ""imitation and refinement through imitation are both necessary to invention itself, and the very lifeblood of a competitive economy."" The only permissible restrictions on copying of publicly-known useful articles, said the justices, are those of federal patent law, which have been crafted by Congress to strike a nationally-uniform balance between the interests of inventors and those of the rest of society.<p>[1] <a href=""http://supreme.justia.com/us/489/141/case.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://supreme.justia.com/us/489/141/case.html</a>",1309605291

8580245,comment,8580043,8580211,0,0,barrkel,,,"There are two approaches described - one a further extension of the other. The first approach still relies on a call stack (but not parameters or locals). Instead of calling a function like this:<p><pre><code>    f(x) =\n      // ...\n      f(x + 1)\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s called like this:<p><pre><code>    f = \n      x = x + 1\n      f()\n      x = x - 1\n</code></pre>\nThe return address from the function call references the code that undoes modification to global state (all locals and parameters have static storage when there is no recursion support), rather than relying on copies of parameters being made as in a modern language.<p>The second is an extension of the first, using goto and labels instead of function calls, but it only works if you don&#x27;t need to distinguish between different call sites. If the recursive function only ever calls itself in one place, and the mutation it needs to make in order to &quot;recurse&quot; is always the same (so it can be consistently undone), then the call stack can be eliminated too.",1415552382

It&#x27;s a problem that&#x27;s lessened in a language with a single standard way of doing OO, a single standard way to do event-driven I/O, or even trivial things like code formatting.<p>The Perl 6 language design directly addresses this problem. The intent is to avoid throwing out the baby (making both timtowtdi and long term language evolution practical) with the bath water (lack of composability of the various ways to do things and of new features that emerge). The Rakudo implementation is most of the way there.",1415552111

8580230,comment,8579713,8579909,0,0,cdh,,,"I may have misunderstood this aspect of the movie, but it seemed to me that the government was determined to convince the public that space exploration, and NASA, were excesses of the past to be avoided. The spacecraft they asked Cooper to pilot was a type of craft that crashed during his testing of the ship, prior to the public (and false) shutdown of space spending.<p>If this ship had the capability to repeatedly leave planets without the rockets shown in the beginning, would they have been able to reveal that to the public? The rockets could have been used for the launch from earth to avoid making that disclosure to the public.<p>Also, it seems like another possibility is that it was simply done to conserve fuel. Maybe the small spacecraft was capable of holding enough fuel for the 3-5 launches shown, but no more? If it wasn’t capable of holding additional fuel that might be needed for the mission, the extra rockets for an initial launch seem like a fair idea, even if they were very expensive.<p>I don&#x27;t know anything about this, so I could be very wrong, but to me it seems like there are some plausible explanations.",1415552060

Instead of making a copy of activation record variables at each level of the recursion, the mutation of the activation record variables is implicitly encoded in the return address pushed onto the call stack, because the code at the return address undoes the mutation.",1415552051

Price isn&#x27;t the issue, Apple simply doesn&#x27;t make a desktop Mac with the specs I want, specifically there is no Mac with a desktop class GPU. You can choose between an iMac with a mobile GPU or a Mac Pro with a compute optimized GPU, I don&#x27;t need nor want either. If Apple made a desktop with a desktop class GPU, I&#x27;d buy it.<p>> The software is little more than a neutered and compromised version of BSD that lets you part way into a walled garden (cue It&#x27;s a trap! meme).<p>It&#x27;s the best user experience available on a POSIX compliant OS.

8580220,comment,8578883,8578883,0,0,eliyak,,,"The problem with redistribution of wealth is that if the very wealthy have, say, 50% of their income taken away, they have 50% less reason to earn it in the first place, by creating goods and services that other people want to buy. And when they do, they necessarily must transfer wealth to other people, in the form of wages, payment for goods and services, and eventually selling the final product (which the purchaser views as a net benefit, and which he necessarily can afford to purchase). That is why the US, which has high wealth inequality, also has high standards of living overall.<p>A million people with $300 each will not be able to create a million washing machines, but one man with $300 million can make 2 million of them, and when he sells them they will improve the lives of the purchasers in a way they could not do by themselves. If 50% of his profits were to be taken away, he will make a decision such as moving his business to another country or state, which has less taxes. This will result in less income to workers and businesses in the original location, and less taxes for that government.<p>If wealth inequality is an evil, it is an evil of the most necessary kind.",1415551897

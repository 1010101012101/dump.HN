If those who don&#x27;t find GEB tedious, overblown and overlong would to agree it&#x27;s just not about Goedel&#x27;s theorem. I mean really not. It&#x27;s about self-reference and stuff. But it absolutely not any kind of exposition of Goedel&#x27;s theorem at all, just stop.<p>And I read it as a kid. I&#x27;ve picked it up recently, I have a degree in advanced math. I kind of like Hofstadter&#x27;s take on AI. But I think GEB is just terrible. I mean, it has long, clever discussions that half-explain thing so I think it makes people feel like they sort of understand things.

6473331,comment,6473054,6473054,28,0,itafroma,,,"The fallacy the author is thinking of is called <i>argumentum e silentio</i>, or the argument from silence. Academically, arguments of the form &quot;well, X civilization is known for meticulous record-keeping and they make no mention of Y, therefore Y must not have happened&quot; would be good examples of arguments from silence.<p>In this instance however, it&#x27;d be of the form, &quot;if our product was defective, our customers would speak up. We haven&#x27;t heard anything from our customers about it, therefore our product is not defective.&quot;<p>The author correctly points out that this formally follows the modus tollens format:<p><pre><code>    A: Our products are defective\n    B: Customers are complaining to us\n    \n    P1. A  B\n    P2. ~B\n    ------\n    C: ~A\n</code></pre>\nThis is a valid[1] argument: assuming the premises P1 and P2 are true, C necessarily follows. The fault in logic comes from P1 not being true: it is not necessarily the case that customers would complain to the company if the product was defective. Since P1 is false, the argument is unsound[2] and thus ~A (our products are not defective) is not necessarily true.<p>However, it&#x27;s important to point out that one can still inductively[3] conclude ~A is <i>likely</i> to be true, just not <i>necessarily</i> true. That is:<p><pre><code>   P1. Based on past evidence, our products being defective likely\n       means customers would speak up about it.\n   P2. Our customers haven&#x27;t complained to us\n   -----\n   C: Our products are probably not defective.\n</code></pre>\nThis is a perfectly fine inductive argument. The company, should they be claiming to make this argument, would have to be amenable to be proven wrong: while it may be unlikely that customers would remain silent if their product was defective, it&#x27;s certainly possible.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundness"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundness</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning</a>",1380588594

Sometimes that&#x27;s a price on the content, other times that&#x27;s an advert.<p>Circumventing the monetization strategy is a statement that you believe you&#x27;re entitled to the content without paying for it.  Almost universally, you&#x27;re not, and this entitlement complex is pervasive through Internet users.  TV shows, movies, music, software, anything that&#x27;s been given artificial scarcity is a target for this entitlement attitude.<p>For some content, this attitude doesn&#x27;t hurt the content producer enough to be meaningful, or the content producer has adapted.

I find reading through and finding bugs in complex binary-only buffer-management or even cryptographic systems &quot;easy&quot; (time consuming, but not requiring much brain function; even obfuscation just adds time and effort, it doesn&#x27;t require greater intelligence); yet, I have never managed to remove every single concurrency bug from an open-source project I maintain that only actually uses threads to separate tasks like &quot;searching&quot; from &quot;downloading update&quot; (of course, I likely didn&#x27;t put as much effort into it, so this doesn&#x27;t prove anything of course: but I hope it makes you think), and I&#x27;ve seen people &quot;much smarter than me&quot; (working at Google and Apple) fail at doing so in systems that are &quot;much more important&quot; (working on Chromium and WebKit).<p>You might then just say that I&#x27;m probably just stupid and that a more reasonable programmer wouldn&#x27;t have the same kinds of issues, but &quot;concurrency is hard&quot; I had assumed was a well-known issue. (And again, I think that this all becomes more more interesting to think about once you realize that a &quot;backdoor&quot; left by an intelligent opponent is going to be nearly indistinguishable from a &quot;bug&quot;. At least once a year there is some obscure privilege escalation bug found in the Linux kernel: I think it is interesting to at least consider momentarily that any of those might have been a backdoor, and not a bug; the concept of what constitutes purposely malicious code updates tends to be way too narrow in my view, and leads people to only consider back doors that are easy to see when you print out the source code.)<p>> There&#x27;s no form of obfuscation that will complicate the code of an open source program as much as compiling it will, while still looking as innocuous as compiling does.<p>Yeah, no: I seriously read through compiled code every day. I was doing a lot of reading through compiled code yesterday while working on figuring out why Substrate isn&#x27;t working on iOS 7 for example. I am much much much more afraid of the bugs that are latent in a large multi-threaded project that has &quot;lots of hands in the cookie jar&quot; so-to-speak than of a simpler implementation distributed as a closed-source binary. I&#x27;m likewise more afraid of open-source projects that accept patches from large numbers of people (which means more people who might be actively /trying/ to add difficult-to-see exploitable bugs), or of projects that are implemented to run as native code versus ones that run inside of type-safe virtual machines (especially if the virtual machine is coded to a spec and I get to select the one it runs on).",1380587410

This embodied the separatist/individualist spirit.<p>But we needed aspects of the Alliance to show a sharp contrast to what the browncoats fought against and lost to. Some of the best moments in Firefly came from Ariel or Trash, which were set very much in the Alliance world.<p>So how does this relate back to this wonderfully produced (hey, nice commercial!) but woefully short-sighted plea from some group who claims to speak for the &quot;fans&quot;. Well if you ONLY watched the original trilogy, you would think that Star Wars was all about the frontier. After all, there was no Coruscant and the moments in the Death Star were really limited in backdrop and exposition.<p>Then again, if you&#x27;ve read any of the canon books or played any of the games, you will know that dozens of storytellers have expanded the Star Wars universe, giving it beautiful color and context around the edges that 7-8 hours of the original trilogy couldn&#x27;t possibly cover.<p>Sure the prequels were bad, but they were bad because they&#x27;re bad movies. I certainly don&#x27;t agree with the de-mysticism of the Force, or Jar Jar, or the implicit racism, or Han not shooting first or Mannequin Skywalker&#x27;s casting, but let&#x27;s be honest, those are just bad movie dialogue, story-telling and direction. These are problems every movie has (have you seen Howard the Duck?)<p>The reason the prequels were NOT about the frontier because it&#x27;s really a story about Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin and Palpatine, whom coincidentally, all lived in Coruscant, a city. The original trilogy were about Luke, Han, Chewie and Leia and they all lived in the frontier, away from the Empire. Let&#x27;s also not overlook the fact that Threepio is comic relief and the Ewoks are cute.<p>In conclusion, let J.J. Abrams make a good movie and let&#x27;s not put artificial boundaries in because we have some misguided fanboy adherence to rules that were made up to begin with. If we listened to the fanboys, we&#x27;d never have Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Heath Ledger as the Joker and there would be 30 minutes of Tom Bombadil singing in the Lord of the Rings.<p>TL;DR: Let JJ Abrams do his job without constraint and Firefly rocks.",1380587261

6473207,comment,6468448,6468448,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"I came to this late and will probably get buried. Anyway, here goes.<p>1. Programming punishes you brutally if you do it wrong. Bugs occur for what seems like no reason, problems are unsolveable, and the job becomes an unrelenting, unrewarding slog. (Conversely, it&#x27;s a hell of a lot of fun if you&#x27;re doing it right.)<p>2. Some companies and teams are managed by idiots who will force you to do things wrong. If you&#x27;re 22, you&#x27;ll probably end up working for at least one or two before you&#x27;re 40. Leave them, because...<p>3. Until you get used to doing things right, and learn how to things properly, and get the credibility that comes with actually being good at this job-- and that takes a while-- nothing will make sense and your career will be for shit.<p>When you&#x27;re bad at your job (and everyone is, when starting out) or when things are bad, it&#x27;s not obvious. Nothing is ostensibly bad, so much as incoherent. You get trapped in a flood of grunt work that seems beyond automation because either (a) you&#x27;re not skilled enough, yet, to do it; or (b) you&#x27;re not in an environment of excellence that encourages automation. When things seem unpleasantly stochastic, get out and move to a more coherent place.<p>The issue with OP is that he hasn&#x27;t figured out that solving the right problems is far more important than solving the highest percentage of what&#x27;s put in front of you. IE hacks? If it&#x27;s your web app, or if you&#x27;re strongly investigated in the success of the thing, make a cost-benefit analysis and decide whether to do the IE hacks; at least if you end up doing them, you&#x27;re doing them for you. If it&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s ambition and you know that doing good work won&#x27;t be paid in kind, just do well enough on the grunt work to avoid political adversity. Then pack away as much time as you can to learn the skills you&#x27;ll need, and make the contacts you&#x27;ll want, for the next act.<p>Rule One, which should never be broken: if it&#x27;s bad for your career, don&#x27;t work on it. I&#x27;m not saying never work on unpleasant stuff. Sometimes, the unpleasant work is important. If you ever want to be a founder, you have to get used to doing annoying or unpleasant work when there&#x27;s no one else to do it. However, if the work actually <i>hurts your career</i>-- and there is plenty of work like that out there-- then it&#x27;s virtually never worth doing.<p>In the short-term, if your boss considers it important, it is (by definition) good for your career. However, if you&#x27;re getting tossed the IE support while the interesting work gets passed on to favorites or hogged, then it&#x27;s time to (a) just get up and do more interesting stuff-- it&#x27;s better to ask for forgiveness than permission-- or (b) find another team or company. So long as people like OP don&#x27;t realize that they need to take self-executive responsibility for their own careers, they&#x27;ll be doing the shit work no one else wants to do.<p>Programming gets a lot better as you (a) get better at it, (b) gain credibility, and (c) learn the warning signs that surround bad jobs and failing teams. There <i>are</i> a lot of people who get to work on better stuff than someone else&#x27;s IE support. It takes a while to get there, and it&#x27;s done one day at a time, but unless you&#x27;re untalented, steady progress will lead that way. Even if you don&#x27;t care to play politics actively, you have to learn the warning signs. That takes years. Until you develop those skills, everything seems nonsensical and wrong, though; and the industry seems uniformly terrible. It&#x27;s not.

Took college classes in Pascal, C, C++, assembly for microprocessors, common lisp for ai, vhdl for processor design, operating systems, and wire-wrapping a microcontroller system.<p>Grad school courses in Smalltalk [edit: and computer architecture and petri nets and, most importantly, self-taught makefiles for a class project build system].<p>After I got out of school I took company courses in Java and Perl, but more importantly taught myself the Unix environment from books, and had opportunities to use it every day at work.<p>On my own, I read books and did programming exercises in Haskell, Ruby, and Go.<p>[edit: I dug seriously into make and bash for ten years, writing the build system for a telecom network.]<p>I have a real passion for functional parallel programming in the Inferno shell, so I&#x27;m working on a blue-sky build-tool project.

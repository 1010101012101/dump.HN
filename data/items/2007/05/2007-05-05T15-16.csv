It's frustrating on reddit to see users downvoted, just because they  posted their own blog.  IMHO, it only solidifies the ""monopoly"" top content producers have on the market.  New bloggers have no way of promoting their own stuff, and nobody to do it for them.<p>Regardless, until things change, I would rather not submit my URLs if I think I'm going to take the heat for it - even if the content is good.",1178380738

19769,comment,19723,19723,0,0,busy_beaver,,,"""I bet most people who use/used PHP got there because it was popular""<p>This is fairly accurate, but not quite the whole story.<p>Ascribing PHP's success to ""popularity"" makes it sound like a simple fashion statement. The reality is that, due to its popularity, PHP has a ton of libraries and an enormous base of existing code (ranging from little hacks to parse a certain data format all the way up to full-blown applications like MediaWiki). It's not just the language, it's the ecosystem.<p>That's a real advantage that's often overlooked by those who advocate other languages. Also, don't forget that PHP hosting is cheap and ubiquitous. Rails, not so much.<p>That said, Ruby is catching up pretty fast, and I've been using Ruby (and sometimes Rails) for any new project that isn't tightly coupled with existing code. For me, writing Ruby is vastly more pleasant and efficient than writing PHP, even though I've been using PHP for five years and Ruby for only one. <p>I still write a lot of Java, too, but JRuby is starting to eat into that pretty fast. It's an end run around the library/existing code problem.<p>",1178379820

RoR is pretty popular right now, so I'm sure a bunch would land on RoR, and it'd be a serious upgrade. :-) I bet most people who use/used PHP got there because it was popular, and not because they compared the relative merits of the languages.",1178378121

In the ideal world you might get more karma for stories you've written yourself as opposed to stories you found elsewhere and submitted, or perhaps there might by a leader board for the highest average submission rating, but the current system seems to get the job done.",1178377225

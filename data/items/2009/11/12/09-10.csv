937448,comment,933788,936236,0,0,bad_user,,,"No, that's called loosely typed.<p>Having type annotations is a big deal because you can infer certain things at compile time.<p>Take for instance (+ x y). In CLisp ""+"" is a multi-method, the dispatch being done at runtime, but if you know that x and y are both integers, there's no need to search the right method to call at runtime, its address is already known. And then you can also decide to inline its code at compile-time if there aren't any conflicts (mostly like a macro, but without the laziness).<p>Of course, in dynamically-typed languages you have the freedom to infer these things at runtime, in certain situations you can infer the types of ""x"" and ""y"", you can use a cache for the call sites, and so on, but it's a lot more complicated, and one of the reasons is that for every optimization you do, you have to be ready to de-optimize when the assumptions have been invalidated.<p>That's why I said SBCL doesn't count as being dynamic in that test because it probably makes full use of those static annotations.",1258019862

937441,comment,936544,937368,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"I have a couple issues with what you're saying.<p>First, there's a long history of name appropriation about which I'm quite certain you've never raised any concerns. For example: this site's domain name, which represents the appropriation of an important bit of CS terminology by a for-profit concern which isn't in any way related to that bit of terminology. Where is your outrage toward PG?<p>And I'm glad you chose 37Signals as an example further on in your post, because they recently launched a search-oriented (helping designers and clients find each other) service named ""Haystack"". A friend of mine was already maintaining a somewhat-popular (in its niche) search framework for Python web apps called... Haystack. Guess how many people are standing up and denouncing 37Signals as the Big Bad Evil Destroyer? You didn't, so far as I'm aware.<p>So it seems somewhat hypocritical, or at the very least arbitrary, to single out Google for the treatment you're advocating while overlooking numerous other examples of the same thing happening.<p>And this leads into my second concern: I don't really see how someone can stake a permanent claim to a name in a field based on not much more than a niche/hobby project. If ""Go!"" had been more heavily marketed or more widely disseminated (or even maintained; it seems to have basically died as a project), I'd be more inclined to sympathy, but the simple fact is that it wasn't: until the past couple of days, it had spent its entire existence shrouded in obscurity, and to my mind that's nowhere near enough to begin dictating the use of the name to anyone.",1258019563
937440,comment,937426,937426,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"No, startups are not ""ALWAYS"" anything; there is a wide variety of people involved in startups.  Startup founders, often very successful ones, can be polite and generous people.  Most people do have flaws of some sort, and sometimes there will be people who have flaws that are distinctly incompatible with your own flaws.<p>If you aren't comfortable with the working environment, you <i>should</i> quit; the world is too wide and life too short to do otherwise. You might prefer to line something else up first, if you're unsure of your prospects or don't have sizable savings.<p>It may just be that you're taking it too seriously. If you have owned up to your mistake, done what you can to reduce its impact to the rest of the team, and apologized, you should let yourself move on. If your boss doesn't see it that way, he's an asshole, and probably isn't worth working for.<p>Also, if he's being such an asshole that he's chasing off and firing people at an alarming rate, the finances of the company may be dramatically worse than you are aware of and he's deluding himself and others into thinking he's being proactive, when really he's just unable to admit that his company is going down the toilet and he should own up to those problems. Actually, I can't think of any instance where a founder was being truly a dick where it didn't boil down to things going really badly and the founder not knowing how to cope with the failure. (I'm sure there have been many...people are sometimes just dicks. But, I can't think of any examples right now, but I can think of several examples of poor financial situation leading to emotional falling outs among founders and employees.)",1258019533

If you don't want to recycle anything, you can just throw everything in the general trash, and noone will know or complain or charge you extra for it.<p>That said, I read an article many years ago by the head of our environmental protection agency, and he rightfully pointed out the externalizing of the cost of sorting on the population, but most importantly he pointed out that recycling of some materials is completely negative, i.e. it is cheaper and uses less energy to create fresh material than recycle the old.<p>The materials that <i>did</i> make sense to recycle though was glass, newspaper and aluminium cans. By not recycling milk cartons or plastic containers, you're doing more for the environment than if you recycle them.<p>The lesson learned is of course that you should always have science to back up your viewpoint, only by making a lifecycle analysis can you find out if a certain activity really is good for the environment, or if it's only good for your conscience.",1258018144

I was so excited when I realized the implications of that I nearly had to sit down.  (Yes, I live a boring life.)<p>I did a bit of that with the documentation to A/Bingo: the documentation is presented in a live demo, the formatted sample code is automatically composed from what I'm actually running (and thus gets automatically patched without me having to do anything special about it), and I copiously abuse my favorite Javascript effects (lightboxes, etc) to make the presentation flow better that linear text.<p>For example, often in tech documentation you want to focus attention on a portion of the code buried in a bunch of boilerplate.  (Or maybe that is just those of us who write Java all day.)  You can bold the bits you want to emphasize, or you can hide the boring details with Javascript and let only those folks who need them look them up.<p>My opinion is this is better than linking to a fuller version on another page, as it interrupts the user's flow less.  It is also more readable than a few lines of bold text studded in the boilerplate, and more usable than omitting the boilerplate and producing code which doesn't function if copy/pasted.",1258017375

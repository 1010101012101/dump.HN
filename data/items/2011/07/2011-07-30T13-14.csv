2825766,comment,2825164,2825164,32,0,bendmorris,,,"Counterpoint: I just began developing my first Android app a few days ago, a turn-based strategy game. I've only had an Android device for a month or so so the platform is relatively new to me, and I didn't even know Java (although, to be fair, I knew C# fairly well a couple years ago, which is arguably the same thing plus type inference.) In a few days, with relatively few problems, I was able to build an app and I'll be releasing it in various markets soon (once I stop polishing and let it go, which is hard for me to do.)<p>I found the experience to be straightforward and intuitive. I was able to find tutorials for any task I couldn't figure out myself and the API documentation is perfectly adequate. Working with images and settings files are two areas where I was very pleasantly surprised at just how easy it was.<p>There were some minor frustrations. The Android emulator fought me a little so I started just debugging on my actual device. Debugging certain problems can be difficult, Eclipse can cause headaches and throw random nonexistent exceptions, etc. but overall I think you've vastly overstated the difficulty level of jumping into Android development. ""The depth of knowledge of in design patterns required is so great..."" It's really not. With almost no experience with Java or Android, I've put together a working app in a few days that, in my opinion at least, is pretty good, and that works on various mobile devices with different resolutions and capabilities.<p>Some other things I'm happy with about the Android platform: the SDK is free, Android is open source, you're very unrestricted with regards to what your app can do, and Android Market developer accounts cost a one time fee of $25 instead of $100 a year.",1312034357

2825749,comment,2825581,2825581,2,0,wisty,,,"You can generally include an arbitration term in contracts. Arbitration can be cheaper and faster than suing. In some cases, arbitration can be even more binding.<p>Point in case - you get a contract with a Chinese company, and state that the appropriate court for all claims is in your home town, in California. You sue the company, and win (as they don't even show up). Then you go to the Public Security Bureau (police) office in <i>their</i> town, and ask them to help size assets. The Chinese police will ask for a Chinese court order, but when you go to a Chinese court they tell you that your contract explicitly states that you should be back in California, and they have no right to intervene. On the other hand, if the contract is worded right, international arbitration treaties will kick in (so the Chinese courts should accept the arbitration decision), basically everyone worth speaking of has signed them. At least, that's my (unprofessional) impression from reading the China Law Blog (i.e. <a href=""http://www.chinalawblog.com/2010/02/arbitration_in_your_china_cont.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chinalawblog.com/2010/02/arbitration_in_your_chin...</a>)<p>But I am not a lawyer, and this is not advice.",1312033830

    e.g. I still have a mortgage, I still want my kids in school, etc.<p>- We manifested ourselves into a dream world, forgot we did it, and eventually got advanced enough to re-discover it. Inception!<p>- Who created the hologram? How? Where/when does it exist?<p>- Are our concepts of physics real or manifested?<p>Interestingly enough, if anyone has ever looked into remote viewing, namely the US-funded, 10-year long program in the 1970s[1] it may be of interest to note that one of the fundamental tenants of remote-viewing is that the universe is a hologram and that ""any part contains the whole"" which is what, they claim, makes remote viewing possible.<p>Another interesting thing I like to think about is how would one go about <i>proving</i> this to somebody?<p>If someone stood infront of you and flew around, walked through a wall or made a basketball appear out of thing air, I think most of us would go to 100 other explanations, including ""oh god, ghost-basketball!"", before settling on that our entire existence is a hologram.<p>Not to mention a large subset of humanity that would just categorically reject it, no matter what you showed them.<p>I'm open to most any explanation; I need proof, but I'm certainly open to it. I accept that there is always something new to learn. Every time I hear someone talk in terms of limits (to science, humanity, technology... anything) I begin to tune them out.<p>If the last 100 years has taught me anything, it is that there seems to be as much to be discovered as there is hunger out there to discover it.<p><i>THAT</i> makes me wonder at times if elements of our existence are (sub) conscious creations, because the discoveries never seem to stop.<p>If you enjoy topics like this, I'd strongly encourage you read the entire Wired article ""Faster""[2].

2825723,comment,2825177,2825177,107,0,jellicle,,,"Sounds to me like Paul Graham has made a fairly fundamental and common mistake, which is to say believing the AirBnb people when they reassure him that everything is under control and there's no fire here.<p>Paul, if you actually read the statements made by the CEO on news.ycombinator.com, it's <i>very clear</i> that AirBnb are the primary, if not only, ones at fault here.<p>I don't want to call Paul a liar, since it seems likely to me that he has just made a mistake of believing someone else.  But he's putting his own reputation behind AirBnb, and AirBnb is lying.  That's unwise.<p>Let me compare a different response that I'm familiar with.  A friend of mine had her apartment destroyed in the 9/11/2001 terrorist attacks.  Insurance companies came and set up booths in Manhattan and were cutting checks left and right, without even SEEING the damage.  My friend had a check in her hand on 9/13 if I recall correctly.  She didn't get in to SEE her own apartment until a month later, and the insurance company didn't see it until much later than that.<p>As of today and yesterday, there are articles in newspapers across the land.  There are phrases like ""As of Friday afternoon, Airbnb had not returned calls from The [Washington] Post requesting comment."" - that's a quote from a WashPost story, of course.  One thing I know: when the Washington Post calls and a company has something good to say about themselves, they take the call (calls, actually).<p>It's apparent from the latest newspaper stories that AirBnb is now reacting in a cover-it-up fashion - they're trying to offer the woman a sum of money with the condition that she shut up.  That's fine, I guess - very corporate of them.<p>But frankly I expected better.  I guess I sort of expected that even if AirBnb was being dumb, that when the first article hit news.yc, that someone would call them and straighten them out.

First time was small amount, and they didn't really <i>stiff</i> me completely, just said they were closing, and they 'paid' in some hardware.  Wasn't all that useful to me, but better than nothing.<p>Second time - I drove up to NYC (from Raleigh) to file in court.  It was for > $5k, so it couldn't be small claims court.  That was Aug 2008 - it's now almost Aug 2011 - still on the docket last I looked.  Court will take a <i>long</i> time.  Even if I 'win', I still have to collect, and if the guy won't pay when he's supposed to, collecting will suck.   In retrospect, I wish I'd have told the client whose project I was working on for that guy - they'd have at least known what they were continuing to let themselves in for by dealing with him.<p>Last time was more recent, and it was just a bad project all around - sorry I took it, sorry the end client didn't get what they wanted, etc.<p>Lesson learned for me is to either never subcontract for someone else, or be very cautious.  I'm doing it now for one other client, but I'd met them multiple times, they have a good reputation in their industry, and I was assured by another sub whose worked with them before that they pay (and pay pretty well).  And they have - been one of the fastest payers I've worked with.<p>If you file a lawsuit - small claims might go faster than regular court - but file and forget.  In my case, my suit was for $8700.  It'd certainly be nice to get it, but I eeked by and moved on, and don't spend much time thinking about it now.  It'll tear you up waiting - move on as best you can, even if you file a suit.<p>btw, are you on the lsc mailing list?  bettermeans looks familiar.",1312031568

There are plenty of boilerplate docs out there for the sow, hire a specialized lawyer for contract docs. They can give you a blanket doc for short money. Even if the client tries not to pay, at least you have a binding agreement from which to negotiate or take them to court. Companies big and small renege on their contracts all the time, don't victimize yourself; it's how some business is done.<p>But if don't have a contract:<p>I'd have to evaluate the client first. If they're already a deadbeat, shame on you for doing business with them and like petervandijck says, just let it go. It's not worth the time and effort to chase them down as they have no means or intention of paying. Blackball them in the community is the worst you can do to them.<p>But, if they're a going concern and they've stolen your time and work and are making money from it, I'd have to engage the services of an attorney and send them a strongly worded letter indicating your intent to sue for unpaid services, a portion of the proceeds of your work corresponding to what you see as adequate (always over 50%) along with damages, legal fees and court costs. Usually that's enough to get them to write you a check, but make sure that you allow them 30 days to pay at first, remind them every week after that and at 60 days have the attorney send the letter. Just because they're not conducting themselves in a professional manner doesn't mean you don't have to. Always take the high road, be firm yet polite and document all communications.",1312031479

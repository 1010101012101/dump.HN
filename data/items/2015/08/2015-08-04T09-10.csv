Always test against what you expect to see in production. If you test against something else first (in this case mocking through an in-memory DB) to make the testing of other parts faster/easier then that is fine, but once those tests are done you still need to do a final full test against the real stack(s) you expect to see in production.<p>On the mocking thing: I thought the point of that was to completely avoid DB calls for speed when testing other logic layers, so even a fast in-memory DB isn&#x27;t needed and anything (i.e. just some code that manufactures a response object) that produces a result set in the right format will do? In that case even using an in-memory DB is less efficient than the other option so is at best a &quot;half optimisation&quot;. Am I missing a point here?",1438682385

  is their only source of revenue.
</code></pre>
There was an interesting article on here the other day [1] that points out the distinction between advertising and tracking, in terms of the interests of content producers.<p>In particular, if you have a valuable audience it&#x27;s actually a bad thing if you let them be tagged as such, then retargeted on lower quality sites.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say I run www.really-good-original-car-journalism.com - it&#x27;s prime advertising space because loads of my readers are in the market for new high-end cars. I make $x per ad click.<p>But if I let ad networks tag my readers as &#x27;shopping for a new high-end car&#x27; and retarget later, my readers get the same adverts on www.bobs-domain-parking.com but at a fraction of the cost per click - and with that much-reduced payment going to Bob, not me.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to run adverts on a website. Letting ad networks track your readers is a different matter - especially if you&#x27;re producing high quality content.<p>[1] <a href=""http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful/</a>",1438682369

Personally I don&#x27;t see voice as a suitable interface for anything. I get that for some minor tasks voice is going to be fast, but for larger workflows voice isn&#x27;t a fast input or feedback method. If you don&#x27;t have a screen in front of you, you&#x27;ll need to keep a mental image of your actions, which seems to just make things harder. If you do have a screen then I don&#x27;t get why you wouldn&#x27;t have a keyboard and mouse to.<p>Honestly I just don&#x27;t want to talk to my computer (or phone), I don&#x27;t see it as an efficient input device. I still haven&#x27;t tried Windows 10, but when I do the first thing I will be looking for is a way to make Cortana disappear. It&#x27;s creepy as hell and not how I want to use a computer. Mostly is seems like a technology we implement be science fiction says we should.<p>Arguably there&#x27;s are cases where voice is better, simply because it really is the only option, car stereos and navigation for example. It&#x27;s really the only safe option.",1438682349

Look at the app store as an example, if people aren&#x27;t even willing to pay 99c for a game that they dump 20+ hours of their life into (which can be done friction-free in 2 taps), why would they pay to read an article with poor journalism about something that doesn&#x27;t really matter to them?<p>Giving up your privacy or agreeing to be shown big adverts for things corporations want you to buy seems to be perfectly accepted outside of our paranoid tech world.

<a href=""http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/dynamic-linking/versioned-symbols"" rel=""nofollow"">http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/dynamic-linking/versioned-...</a><p>Dynamic linking is <i>not</i> synonymous with security or ease of use. It&#x27;s known to significantly reduce performance, both when loading as well as runtime whenever an external symbol is used, and the memory savings aren&#x27;t too great. One has to remember that static linking also means that unused symbols are left behind, as the compiler knows what is needed.<p>Ability to update components of an application is one of the ideas behind dynamic linking, but in practice it doesn&#x27;t work that well, and often requires that the application is updated to link against a newer version, which of course can only happen when the distro updates. This also includes LTS distros and backports, which you either have to wait for or kill support for.<p>There&#x27;s also a difference in how Go vs. things like C and C++ handles linking, due to Go actually knowing about multiple files, and who uses what. This is quite a bit different than the copy-pasta that C preprocessors generate. We just ported a major product from C++ to Go, which gave us significant performance boost with considerably less code and complexity (This is not a &quot;Go is better than C++&quot;, Go just provided a lot of things we needed in the std library that were hard to get in C++). The &quot;necessities&quot; were dynamically linked (libstdc++, libgcc_s, pthread, libc, ...), but our own libs were statically linked in. The binary was 51MB. The equivalent, <i>completely</i> statically linked Go binary is 8MB. It also does a clean build in <500ms, rather than the 3-5 minutes it took for the C++ project.<p>... But do remember, that Go 1.5 brings dynamic linking for the ones that want it. While the Go creators don&#x27;t seem super fond of dynamic linking, they <i>are</i> providing it.<p>Regarding updating, &quot;go get -u packagename&quot; will update all dependencies, assuming the dependencies are go-gettable. Vendoring changes the picture a bit, in the sense that applications will bundle their own version of things to simplify things a bit, but that doesn&#x27;t really change the go get -u command. Follow with a go build, and your application is up to date.",1438679781

We want to create an ecosystem built on open hardware and software so its easy for anybody to get to this great content, anytime, anywhere, without one of the &quot;big guys&quot; imposing their rules on who gets what, when, or where. </i><p>This is plain crazy. Netflix can&#x27;t offer their service without DRM, Intel can&#x27;t even release a chip without supporting DRM. How on earth did anyone expect this to be succesful without DRM? In the kickstarter movie they even show clips of Game of Thrones and John Oliver, how did people envision the Matchstick to play that content without DRM support?<p>And then the craziest part, after working for 11 months with I imagine a team of at least 3 but probably more, they fail which is understandable but then they <i>refund</i> the kickstarter campaign. That means they actually have 470k lying around. Probably from VC funding.<p>So they used the kickstarter money as leverage in VC negotiations, got funded. Then worked for 11 months on something the kickstarter backers didn&#x27;t ask for which creates a backlash, then they decide to drop the kickstarter. I wonder what their investors think of it &quot;Oh yeah, the initial 17000 people that believed on our project whom we woo-ed you with? Yeah they&#x27;re not happy with the direction we&#x27;re going in so we&#x27;re dropping them&quot;. So now it&#x27;s just going to be an HDMI TV stick which to my knowledge already exist right?<p>(BTW the proper way this should&#x27;ve gone is: After 11 months Matchstick admit they got nowhere because of supplier issues (i.e. they couldnt get DRM) have run out of money and give up. The backers sue for reimbursement. Matchstick LLC files for bankruptcy, court finds no wrongdoing, no one gets money. The end and everyone lives happily ever after.

This is more or less the problem described here -- by submitting the post with a title that gets either automatically blocked or ignored/downvoted by the community, one can easily bury posts that might otherwise garner a fair bit of traffic.<p>Once it becomes common to game any particular aggregator, it becomes less trustworthy and therefore less useful as a filter.

Users very rarely if ever go to the blizzard admin page and thus won't be typing a special question in when they are just logging in to the game. Another solution is to confirm such authenticator drops through email or text. Both of these could be quickly implemented.

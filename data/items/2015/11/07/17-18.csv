For example, there is one study that suggests there are no known benefits to yogurt.<p>Well, apart from its being food, protein and fat.  :)<p>I once spent part of an evening reading the labels of all yogurts in my local chain supermarket, looking for the smallest counts of &quot;ingredients that aren&#x27;t yogurt&quot; and carbs (I&#x27;m type 2 diabetic, hence my interest in carb count over the day). For my supermarket, that turned out to be Fage greek yogurt. I eat their full-fat product almost every morning, and I can state without a doubt that it is food. :)",1446919163

Also, if they had, lots of people couldn&#x27;t afford child care.<p>I know this will sound terrible, but if you cannot afford to pay child care, maybe the economy is telling you that your marginal job is not worth be done or held. The reality in US and many countries following it&#x27;s economic model is that unemployment is a chronic, ignored problem. Marginally useful jobs can exist because there is always a big pool of desperate people ready to take poverty wages. You will do yourself and everyone a favor by not competing in that race to the bottom.<p>As long as the child is being raised by a family with at least 2 adults, a stay at home mom or dad is perfectly capable of providing care while at the same time engage in all types of frugality and household economy activities that will extend the salary of the sole breadwinner beyond what is normally possible for a couple of overstressed careerists. They can also engage in education and creative activities that will allow them to pick up a career later, when the kids are old enough to attend school (which is a sort of mandatory daycare, anyways).<p>Also, it is important to recognize that a single parent raising children is a extraordinary and unsustainable situation (though sadly common through history). Subsidies, charity and informal help from extended family, friends and neighbors should be directed to this cases, instead of being spread out trying to benefit as many people as possible.",1446919152

E.g. it&#x27;s difficult to get hired as a customer retention marketer without knowing how to code, but most of those folks also aren&#x27;t coding on a regular basis, if ever. It&#x27;s just that when you have 500+ people applying for any decent job, the person who thought it wasn&#x27;t a good use of their time to spend 3 months teaching themselves to code is almost always going to lose out to one of the other folks who did, just on the off chance that those skills actually come in handy or whatever.<p>Is it unfair? Maybe. But that&#x27;s just how it works.<p>If you were to look at my HN comments from the early days of the site, you&#x27;d see that I was pretty much the poster child for saying that learning to code wasn&#x27;t necessary.

Other displays may be as large as a city block.<p>And that&#x27;s just <i>viewable</i> output. TTS (text to speech) and voice recognition are also increasingly present.<p>The same <i>presentation</i> systems don&#x27;t work across these. But <i>well-encoded semantic content</i> is amazingly robust. I remember learning of the &#x27;-man -Tps&#x27; (I think) nroff/groff argument -- that is, apply manpage macros, and format for postscript output. The same manual page markup that is readable in a console suddenly becomes pretty-printed (and created a brief market in the late 1990s / early 2000s for &quot;Linux Bible&quot; manpage dump books). Groff has more tricks up its sleeve, and as the Debian dwww package shows, manpages can be converted directly to viewable HTML.<p>But groff is grotty. I knew it (or precursors) once, well enough to turn in several Uni essays prepared via it. But those neural pathways have long since eroded.<p>I&#x27;d replaced it for quite some time with HTML, a reasonably versatile structured markup system, particularly given that most of what I was writing was intended for online Web publication at some point.<p>In the past few years I finally cracked the Lion book and started using LaTeX. I&#x27;d realised what the blocks were to my earlier attempts (ironically, &quot;easy-to-use&quot; tools such as Lyx actually had  gotten in the way), and discovered that it was, as an <i>authoring</i> tool, often far <i>lighter</i> than HTML. Double carriage returns as paragraph breaks replaces seven discrete keystrokes per paragraph. Other constructs are a bit less lightweight, but remain clear.<p>But the real win is in how LaTeX is both a <i>structured</i> and <i>validated</i> document format. Screw up your HTML somehow, or follow some vendor&#x27;s proprietary extensions, and a browser will say &quot;eh, close enough&quot;. Omit a closing brace or backstroke or dollar sign, and your LaTeX compiler will scream at you until it&#x27;s blue in the face. Unsettling the first few times it happens, but you begin to realise it&#x27;s right.<p>The Web is an error condition: <a href=""http://deirdre.net/programming-sucks-why-i-quit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://deirdre.net/programming-sucks-why-i-quit/</a><p>But deeper than that, LaTeX offers <i>structure</i>.<p>Documents have titles, and authors, and publication dates. They quite frequently have <i>references</i> and <i>bibliographic citations</i>.<p><i>Text notes -- foot, side, end, whate&#x27;er -- aren&#x27;t some fucking foreign bolted-on concept.</i><p><a href=""http://codepen.io/dredmorbius/details/OVmBaZ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codepen.io/dredmorbius/details/OVmBaZ</a><p>There are other bits and pieces that are missing from both, and LaTeX, not <i>principally</i> oriented to online publication, is short on stuff as well. But then, HTML doesn&#x27;t have a native concept of reputation-ranked, hierarchical, collapsable comment streams either. Despite Usenet&#x27;s prior art staring it gloweringly in the face for 25 years.<p>And yes, LaTeX as a direct authoring environment has its downsides. I&#x27;ve actually taken to preferring Markdown for my intial pass through writing documents, and it&#x27;s a langauge which can readily be front-ended by the GUI-friendly tools most writers will want.<p>And HTML5&#x27;s semantic structures and the valient attempts by some (see Readability&#x27;s Developers section and the hNews microformats specs) <i>are</i> actually pretty cool. But until and unless someone steps in to <i>require</i> validated content before they&#x27;ll pass it (and &quot;someone&quot; tends to be spelled &quot;major search engine&quot;, which is spelled &quot;Google&quot; -- who <i>have</i> actually stepped in to police some standards of online behavior and presentation), we&#x27;re stuck with the fact that crap HTML is still blindly accepted.<p>But if anything, front-ended by Markdown or other simple markup languages, it&#x27;s HTML that should be replaced by TeX.",1446917774

10525437,comment,10524717,10525068,0,0,oneJob,,,"Finally! An opportunity to say something positive about representative democracies! The opportunities to do so are rather meager these days, it seems, what with all the talk about their failings and lackings, especially when compared to direct democracy, which is becoming more and more possible every day. This is a tailor made case for representative democracy.<p>To all the comments speaking to the shortcomings of their legislators and how those shortcomings translate to suboptimal or even outright harmful laws, please consider two other options. Direct democracy and laissez-faire /libertarianism /anarchy.<p>First, consider direct democracy. By opening the legislative process to every eligible citizen, there is little chance the voting base will become more knowledgeable as to the issues of technology it will be voting on. It will in all probability become less knowledgeable, on par. Direct democracy increases the cognitive load on the legislator by orders of magnitude. By not having professional legislators each citizen must become, in addition to already being a productive member of the work force keeping their skills sharp and keeping abreast of advancements in their field, being a responsible, good member of their social circles, oh, and having a personal life, they must now both make decisions as to when they should devote resources to their legislative duties, given there will always be something up for vote, they must also devote resources deciding how they will vote. So, direct democracy not only creates a larger pool of non expert technology legislators but it also creates a framework in which those new legislators are less capable to devote the appropriate resources to legislate effectively.<p>Now consider the laissez-faire case. This one is easy, and for a contemporary case study one just needs to look at the recently drafted TPP language on restrictions on States regarding OSS. Laissez-faire simply settles in whatever state is conducive to the capabilities and sensibilities of the most fit entity given the initial state of the environment and its constituents. If the environment is most conducive to an entity which is benevolent and intelligent, awesome. If it is conducive to the successful outcome of a self interested, profit motive driven entity, awesome or not, that is the outcome in that case. It is amoral. No judgement. Just outcome.<p>The case for representative democracy then follows rather nicely, for once. Representative democracy creates a specialized space for crafting legislation where the citizens concerned about a given piece of legislation can appeal to the legislators to devote more resources to that particular issue, over other issues. Additionally they can provide additional resources to the legislators on a case by case basis to help them legislate, which may come in the form of financial assistance, access to relevant case or field studies, or experts in the domain. The non legislative citizens can then still go on about their lives, and the legislators can craft better quality legislation. Lobbying would be a form of this activity, but one in which the non legislative party is already decided as to how the legislation should look in its finished form, rather than simply trying to inform better legislation.<p>Two other benefits of representative democracy. The process inserts safety-switches in the form of, for example, checks and balances  (only possible when the legislature is split in to different bodies, does not work when the whole legisture is involved in every part of the process), vetoes and recalls (same thing here), or the formalized process itself, which might require drafting, review, certification, or cooling-off/reflection periods.<p>All of which I mention to say that, sure, our &quot;legislators&quot; proper have had some pretty dumb moments recently while discharging their duties, but let&#x27;s not throw the baby out with the bath water. They are only a small part of our law making apparatus. Lobbyists have certainly been providing their full energy. The process itself, while never perfect, has certainly done well for its constituents  over an extended historical period, especially compared to other experiments; part of the beauty of the currently implemented process is its ability to improve and broaden the scope of its constituency, which should certainly continue. And there are some examples of grass roots activity influencing the dialogue and end-product.<p>As technology experts, throwing our support and resources behind the entire process, in a holistic fashion, providing expertise, opening up operations to legislators and citizens so they can familiarize themselves with often mysterious domains, providing a forumn for dialogues surrounding the issues, etc, this, to me at least, seems like a promising way forward, as opposed to withdrawing from the process all together and assuming everthing will sort itself out to one&#x27;s personal liking. Not every issue will be settled in a manner that will satisfy each citizen every time. But that is the trade off one makes for being part of a larger community which shares most, but not necessarily each of their interests and priorities with the other members of their community. On balance though, we should all be better off if everyone engages and basic rights are respected.<p>So, yeah, call you Senator or Representative today. :)",1446917241

Imagine having a whole 360* view on screen but with it kind of squished around the edges, when you look out to an area on the edge it could immediately foveate the display to that area.<p>2) Eye contact - Could be really cool. Monsters that can only move when you look away (or blink). Or they disappear if you look directly at them. The NPC&#x27;s stop talking or get upset if they think that you&#x27;re not paying attention.<p>3) natural targeting - I&#x27;d like to try this but I&#x27;m skeptical.

This application dynamically focuses and blurs the depth of field of an image as you look around. One of the big problems with 3D immersive tech right now (Real3D, oculus) is that you can&#x27;t capture this element of natural vision.

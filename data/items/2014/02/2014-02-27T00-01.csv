7309500,comment,7308071,7308071,4,0,mkhattab,,,"A common thread or line of argument that I find when reading about new editors is their out-of-the-box ease of use compared to Emacs and Vim. For example, a quote from the Atom blog:<p>>Sublime and TextMate offer convenience but only limited extensibility. On the other end of the spectrum, Emacs and Vim offer extreme flexibility, but they aren&#x27;t very approachable and can only be customized with special-purpose scripting languages.<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem like they (and many others) are denying that Emacs and Vim are excellent editors. Why is ease of use such an important issue for text editors? Emacs isn&#x27;t terribly difficult to use, but if my livelihood and the majority of my time is tied to what tools I use, then it&#x27;s worth the investment of time. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve met an Emacs user who has put in the effort of learning Elisp and customizing Emacs to their liking ever deny the benefits of learning it in the first place. Yes, it&#x27;s a pain in the ass initially. I quit Emacs twice before I became determined to stop whining and spend quality time learning about tooling.<p>There is no doubt that Emacs has a steep learning curve and perhaps that&#x27;s because its developers have a higher expectation of its users. I would argue that these expectations are easily matched by the capabilities of a competent programmer.",1393462505

Generally there would be no repercussion for scamming the other party; the MMO companies forbade the trade, payment providers don&#x27;t care, and the government doesn&#x27;t really recognize it as a real transaction.<p>These markets had a deeply ingrained reputation system tied to the message board, but escrow was also very common. Many people would offer their services as middlemen to provide escrow for trades, but over time there became an alarmingly high number of middlemen who would properly handle dozens or even hundreds of trades, then scam both parties simultaneously once they came across the biggest transaction of their life. No repercussions came to them; they just stopped being middlemen and had fun with their treasure.<p>These kinds of examples show that reputation, cryptographic authentication, proof of payment, payment irrevokability, and plain man-in-the-middle escrow combined are still not enough to actually prevent fraud in many cases.<p>There are some examples of 2-man escrow systems out there using Bitcoin, though, which is far more promising. That prevents any one party from scamming the other 2. The remaining problem, which I imagine will never be solved, is the vendor proving or the buyer disproving that the vendor gave the goods or services that were asked for.",1393461245

That was a program dealing with sound, not with anything visual.<p>You&#x27;re right that computers for computers sake is missing the point. But so is dismissing computers because they&#x27;re computers, or because they&#x27;re used in unconventional ways.<p>I can at least say that using that program made it a lot easier to get into a more meditative state. And it was not supposed to be a perpetual training wheel, more like a temporary one, until you could get the same desired effect without any sound-aid.",1393459573

Emacs terminology is a little off-putting because it was invented before the GUIs were widely adopted so it doesn&#x27;t map that well. I also find some of the APIs a bit weird, but that could just be me.",1393459448

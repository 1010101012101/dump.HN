846576,comment,846310,846563,0,0,cwan,,,"I think this goes back to whether newspapers are selling their content or the medium.  From what I recall, the general rule of thumb (used to be?) that a newspaper gets a third of revenues from advertisers, a third from classifieds and a third from subscriptions.<p>The much broader problem that affects all of the above has been that readerships have been in decline - in some cases rather steep decline.  Further, from the supply side of the argument, the supply of media that's available to advertisers has broadened considerably because of the internet.  But there's always been demand for valuable content - and that's what I would suggest has been a problem.  That for quite some time that demand was captive - people didn't have alternatives.<p>Now they do, and now they're looking elsewhere.  Even when the businesses in the retail, auto, financial and real estate sectors come back, traditional media won't - it's been in decline far longer than this current/past recession.  This I think has a great deal to do with the value (or lack thereof) that people see in traditional media versus the alternative sources they can find increasingly available because of the net.",1254030811

The sort function gets called for each page view, the user's profile (username / logout / threads) gets accessed for each view, so the only thing that needs to be resolved is the specific sort function.<p>The conversation threading could indeed become a bit fragmented, but then again, each time you look at a story on HN the comments <i>will</i> be in a different order due to the weighting and voting.",1254029491

846554,comment,844979,846123,0,0,dkokelley,,,"The purpose of upvotes here is what? Is it to decide where in a thread which comments will go? If that's the case, I see no reason for any visual cue as to number of upvotes. Their position means I will see them first. (Comments about weighted averages of comment threads used to determine position also work well.) If it's a tool to reward people for their insightfulness, why not let them show it off? Perhaps the problem is that the comment system is designed to do both, and one function is conflicting with the other.<p>Personally, I like seeing my karma go up when I submit useful comments or stories, so they work as a reward for me (and possibly everyone else here). However, I think the more important function of up/downvotes is bringing the 'best' discussions to the top and burying the garbage.<p>My dictatorial solution would be to hide comment count (and all visual indicators other than thread position), from everyone but the user they belong to. I would still get my 'reward', the mob-voting influence would be diminished, and comment quality would go up.",1254028818

What the singleton pattern is, and why and when you should use it? If you cant answer one or all of those questions, then its time to start learning the techniques.<p>A thousand times this, I'd respect a programmer who can do this and a lot more in a single language, rather than FizzBuzz on 10 different languages.<p>Even though being a polyglot helps (and provides different perspectives to solving problems - OO, functional, etc), a decent level of knowledge needs to be in place for that perspective to resort to anything of use.",1367297753

Is this anyone else's experience?</i><p>Try it with an infant, and you'll find the need to further qualify ""people"", because as you put it, the theory doesn't work out. So let's call them grown-ups, not referring to just being physically grown up either. Now, where do you draw the line, and how do you assess on which side of it a stranger is?<p>What I'm asking is, what makes you assume the person you see begging actually <i>did</i> have a fair shot at it? I don't deny that some of them did, but even if it was the majority; what make you <i>assume</i> that about every single one? That it's comfortable? That it couldn't possibly be that it is just LUCK that you weren't raped as kid and ended up as alcoholic with 12, or something like that? Just face it, as much as effort makes a difference, it's still luck to even have a chance. If everybody got what they ""earned"", all of us would have the same, namely non-existence. It's easy to forget privilege once you have it, and make that the cut-off point.<p>So personally I like to err on the side of compassion. I don't like drunks, alcohol is a black hole and to be honest, I consider some of them walking dead; I don't like being actively bothered too much, and professional beggers are air to me; but otherwise, giving a bit of change is sometimes just a way of not ignoring a person, and an opportunity to wish them a nice day. That doesn't change their life, but it's at least a tiny ray of light instead of yet another rain drop of being ignored, which is proportional to how little it costs me personally.<p>There are people who simply fell on hard times, and what the am I expected to ask of them so they can ""earn"" a few cents, or euros? To prove that it wasn't their fault, to have their papers on hand? To shine my shoes? To ask real nice? Sure, I'll admit, I like it more to give something to someone trying to sell those homeless people newspapers, or someone playing an instrument. But I rarely take the paper (though as far as newspapers go, they beat mainstream ones, they're way more interesting), and the crappier they are at playing the instrument, the more likely I am to give.<p>I'm not berating you for your choices, but I know why I make mine, and why I feel good about giving.",1367297603

5630481,comment,5620842,5627247,1,0,glenra,,,">> <i>And the FDA has quite likely killed more people than it has saved,</i><p>> <i>My immediate reaction is to say you're full of shit. But I'll hold off judgment and see if you can offer any shred of an argument that justifies this statement (not even asking for proof here).</i><p>The result of the FDA's post-1962 efforts has been to dramatically slow the rate of introduction of new drugs with essentially no effect on the average quality level of the drugs that do get introduced. Some new drugs still get through, but less than half as many per unit time and the FDA approval process <i>delays</i> the use of those drugs and makes them vastly more expensive to develop. These extra delays and higher costs are estimated to have caused, at a minimum, hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths.<p>Good drugs save lives. Good drug information saves lives. The FDA often finds itself in the business of postponing the use of good drugs and preventing the dissemination of valid drug information. It has a powerful institutional bias towards inaction, but <i>failing to approve good drugs in a timely manner</i> kills people with at least as much certainly as does letting bad ones through.<p>The notion that the modern FDA on net hurts us more than it helps is a pretty common belief among those economists who have studied the matter. I'd start with this general overview of the issues:<p><a href=""http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/PharmaceuticalsEconomicsandRegulation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/PharmaceuticalsEconomicsa...</a><p>And then browse this site - lots of good stuff there:<p><a href=""http://www.fdareview.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fdareview.org/</a><p>Bryan Caplan summarizes the general state of opinion as: ""The public thinks the FDA is great. Regular economists think it's pretty good. And economists who <i>specialize in the FDA</i> think it's pretty bad.""

If the low tax rate attracts businesses (or even just causes corporations to arrange to report all their profits in your jurisdiction) you may end up with quite a lot of revenue even at the lower rate.<p>The key to that game is convincing all the other countries not to play. If you have low taxes and no one else does, you win. If you and all the other countries have low taxes, all the countries lose and the corporations win.<p>The U.S. strategy is kind of interesting: The corporate taxes are nominally really quite high, but the largest corporations (i.e. the ones best able to leave or rearrange holdings) don't actually pay them.",1367294673

Say they did a bunch of work, months out of date, and then wanted to merge it in. Almost assuredly there'd be tons of conflicts, the code wouldn't match up at all with the current state of the world, and what they did in the commits would be entirely useless knowledge without also knowing what resolutions to the conflicts happened as part of the merge commit.<p>So anyone that looks back at those commits that were made against the old codebase have to know that what they're looking at is horseshit which had to be patched up before it could be merged in.<p>If they had used a rebase strategy they'd have updated their commits to the current state of the codebase such that they could be cleanly applied. Now you still know what feature(s) were added, but in a way that actually took into account the current state of origin when the commits were rebased.",1367294672

But things have changed some.<p>One thing I still use it for is monitoring features to maintainability.  In other words, in established products/projects I will monitor my teams LOC checked in and I look for it to stay as small as possible or to decrease with revisions.  Obviously this doesn't always happen, but I would rather reward the guy who removes 50 LOC versus the guy that adds 200, assuming they both got the same job done and features were delivered.<p>I feel that LOC should never be used outside of the development team.  i.e. No non-technical business mgr should ever see the metric as it is too easy to misunderstand or abuse.<p>Also, LOC as I use it for established teams is almost totally useless in startups as the amount of code is usually pretty rapidly changing and expanding.  Thus making LOC deceiving and misleading in my opinion.",1367294571

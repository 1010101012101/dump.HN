Why can&#x27;t you simply measure people against a consistent, externally-defined bar, and reward them based on their share of their performance group?<p>e.g., Employees who hit the bar are in group C, employees who exceed it are in group B, employees who are extraordinary are in group A. Each group has a portion of the bonus pool, and each member of a group gets the same as every other member of their group.<p>You can still get rewarded for better work, but now you&#x27;re no longer working against an arbitrary bar defined by your peers. If you, hypothetically, have a team <i>full</i> of rockstars then everyone shares the bonus pool equally. Done.<p>Also, what&#x27;s up with tying raises (not bonuses) to performance rankings? At the end of the day people will leave if they can get paid more elsewhere. The best/only way to ensure your employees don&#x27;t leave is to keep paying them at or near what they can get on the open market today. That guy may be the weakest engineer on your team, but he&#x27;s still a good engineer and can do a lot better than the shitty 2% raise you&#x27;ve stuck him with.",1384221197

Given their architecture (distributed nodes), network latency is minimal, so this is essentially two calls to the database.<p>show {\n _id,\n title\n}<p>actor {\n _id,\n appearedIn : [id]\n}<p>db.find({&quot;title&quot;:&quot;awesomeshow&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:1})\ndb.find({&quot;appearedIn&quot; : showId})<p>Each actor is unique in the database, when you query, you get back unique actors. I&#x27;m not sure why they&#x27;re scared of joins (or multiple queries in mongo).<p>The question you ask yourself is not whether you&#x27;re joining, but how often you&#x27;re joining.

Email addresses, multi-select radio buttons, text areas, etc. Some forms only gets submitted once or twice, others are submitted many thousands of times. To store this in a normal relational database you either need many tables, or you need to normalize your data (probably Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) style). We didn&#x27;t want hundreds of tables, and designing a good EAV system can be tough (Magento anyone?), so we looked at other options.<p>We&#x27;ve settled currently on using MongoDb, with one collection to hold the (versioned) definition of each form&#x27;s fields (data type, order, validation rules, etc), and another collection to hold all of the submissions (this is a laaarge collection). There _is_ a &quot;relation&quot; between the form definition and the submissions, but because you always query for submissions based on the form (by form_id), you don&#x27;t really need to do &quot;JOINs&quot; (you just query out the form definition once, before the submissions). Also, because the forms are versioned, and each submission is associated with a particular version of a form, there is no need to retroactively update the de-normalized schema of past submissions (although this does limit your ability to query the submissions if a form is updated frequently - or drastically).

That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that they&#x27;re suboptimal, and in this case lead to worse performance.<p>> RAII doesn&#x27;t fit into Go, philosophically, as it lets you trigger hidden functionality on the creation or destruction of data structures, whereas a deferred function can only be run if there&#x27;s a defer statement there in the code (where you can see it).<p>I&#x27;m focusing more on RAII as implemented with &quot;scope&quot; in D; whether stuff runs explicitly or implicitly is an orthogonal design choice (although I prefer implicitly running code since you need finalizers anyway in any GC&#x27;d language, including Goso you might as well embrace it). With the &quot;scope&quot; statement you also always have to explicitly call the destructor, but in a lexically scoped way.<p>The main thing I find suboptimal with &quot;defer&quot; is the choice of dynamic mutable state as compared to lexical scoping.<p>> In Go, the only way to execute a block of code is to make a function call.

That means everyone gets paid based strictly on seniority. At many firms, this even carries through the partnership ranks.<p>This is really only true for the associates any more, and it&#x27;s a source of a lot of frustration. Mostly, I hear complaints about how either senior associates or junior partners are &quot;carrying&quot; the senior partners in some cases because their billing rate and total hours billed is grossly disproportionate to their income. Also, while salary might be locked based on which year an associate is in, there are all kinds of games played with which year associates get slotted into, especially if they move laterally between firms.<p>I don&#x27;t agree that lock-step systems increase cooperation; if anything, they turn competition into a winner-takes-all game because they&#x27;re generally associated with a strong &quot;up-or-out&quot; culture where you either get promoted or culled over time.

6715201,comment,6711863,6711863,5,0,tomrobinson,,,"The BitPrice team has been in discussions with the UK government and regulators about Bitcoin for the past 9 months. Although I share many of the frustrations expressed here, I am much more optimistic about the outlook for Bitcoin in the UK.<p>As a prospective UK Bitcoin exchange, we have managed to secure meetings with the FCA, HM Treasury and Number 10 Policy Unit - in fact weve managed to get into Downing Street twice to talk about Bitcoin. At the higher levels there does seem to be a genuine desire to engage with and promote new financial technologies such as Bitcoin, and to increase competition in the UK banking and payments sector.<p>Educating people is still 99% of the battle  explaining what Bitcoin is, dispelling the myths and spelling out the benefits, whilst not ignoring the risks. The VAT issue is an example of the obvious lack of understanding of Bitcoin in some quarters. We were also notified by HMRC that they consider Bitcoin to be a voucher: &quot;most likely a face-value voucher&quot;, on which VAT must be paid. For anyone with even a basic understanding of Bitcoin, this obviously doesn&#x27;t make sense: they aren&#x27;t issued by anyone, they don&#x27;t have a &quot;face value&quot; and they can be redeemed for a wide range of goods and services.\nIf they insist on using the &quot;voucher&quot; classification, the &quot;credit voucher&quot;, which can be &quot;redeemed at a number of retailers&quot; and on which VAT is not usually due, seems more appropriate. Hopefully this issue can be resolved quickly by simply switching to this classification.<p>The upshot of these meetings is that we do now have a commitment from the Treasury that they will seriously consider how Bitcoin might achieve official recognition in the UK. In doing this the government is seeking input from Bitcoin businesses, for example through the FinTech Challenger Business Workshop that NewFinance organised a couple of weeks ago. Any interested parties can submit comments, which will be passed on to the government, see:<p><a href=""http://files.meetup.com/2243521/RFC%20-%20FinTech%20Challenger%20Businesses%20Workshop%20-%20Oct%202013%20.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://files.meetup.com/2243521/RFC%20-%20FinTech%20Challeng...</a><p>A common concern expressed by many fintech businesses at this event was the difficulty in obtaining bank accounts and accessing the UK payments network. This issue isnt restricted to Bitcoin businesses  at the moment it is almost impossible for any money service business to obtain a bank account in the UK. The current lack of recognition of Bitcoin by financial regulators doesn&#x27;t help the situation, but it is a wider money laundering issue.<p>Overall, I am optimistic that the UK will take an enlightened approach to Bitcoin, and that banking and tax issues will be resolved soon.

6715196,comment,6714371,6715165,5,0,enneff,,,"> defer inhibits refactoring since moving things to function bodies or inlining function bodies silently changes semantics, and cannot be optimized as easily, because of the dynamic aspects.<p>As someone who has written and reviewed hundreds of thousands of lines of Go code, I haven&#x27;t observed this to be the case in practice.<p>RAII doesn&#x27;t fit into Go, philosophically, as it lets you trigger hidden functionality on the creation or destruction of data structures, whereas a deferred function can only be run if there&#x27;s a defer statement there in the code (where you can see it).<p>In Go, the only way to execute a block of code is to make a function call. There are no constructors, destructors, or any other kind of side effect to allocating or deallocating data structures. This brings a huge benefit in terms of readability and transparency.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m not sure why we&#x27;re comparing defer and RAII, because they&#x27;re generally used for different purposes.",1384218095
6715195,comment,6712717,6714710,6,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"This is the basic cooperation vs. competition problem. If you have competition then people spend a lot of resources fighting because what matters most is being faster than your friends, even if that means working to slow them down. Whereas if you have cooperation then you get complacency because then nobody has to be faster than anybody, so everybody can sit on their duff.<p>It seems to me the solution is to rate people against absolute standards, never against each other. The article seems to think this doesn&#x27;t work because you can&#x27;t give a large bonus to everyone, but that smells like BS to me. If everyone is legitimately doing an outstanding job then the company as a whole should be doing outstandingly well, which means you should have plenty of money to pay everyone a large bonus. (Unless the metrics you&#x27;re using are bunkum, in which case there&#x27;s your problem.) The key is to make it absolutely without individual benefit to sabotage one&#x27;s coworkers while still creating the incentive to excel personally.<p>Along similar lines, if you want to deal with the quarterly results bias, average it out. Publish numbers quarterly (or even more often than that) but set compensation based on an employee&#x27;s five year average, not what they did just now. If you do poorly this quarter then you don&#x27;t lose $1000 from your bonus this quarter, instead you lose $50/quarter for the next five years. At the same time, you still get a ~$1000 bonus this quarter, and you still want that number to go up next quarter, so you&#x27;re keeping an eye on that average -- just not doing it this quarter at the expense of next quarter, because the psychological instant gratification of doing that goes away.",1384218088

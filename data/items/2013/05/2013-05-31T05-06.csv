5797116,comment,5796935,5796935,9,0,lukifer,,,"I've seen this ""public timestamping"" use case before, which is a very interesting exploitation of BitCoin's mechanic.<p>It is curious, though, that it bears a micro-cost, even at a thousandth of a penny. I've often heard it said that BitCoin is unique as a currency in that the total quantity is inherently fixed; but in fact, it's destined to ever-so-slowly dwindle over time, whether due to public ledger uses, or the loss/destruction of private keys.<p>One-off transactions won't register as a blip, it's possible that some future use case might run at such a staggering scale (stock market micro-transactions?) that it leads to a financial tragedy of the commons and deflation runs rampant.<p>Not being doom-and-gloom, just an interesting thing to think about. Just as we now marvel at the naivet of thinking that 4 billion IP addresses or 64K of RAM would be more than enough, I wonder if someday we'll look back the same way on the minimum transaction of 0.0000001 BTC.",1369979964

For example, if a hypothetical illicit VPN was created, hosted by a large server in Serbia, criminals in the US could tunnel their traffic through chains of proxies, with this VPN server at the end of the chain. US law enforcement would have quite a bit of trouble seeing the internals of this network, at least without significant social engineering and investigation.<p>If a network is freely joinable and is a ""panopticon"" (everyone can see everyone else), investigation into the network can be done by anyone anywhere, with ease. What IP addresses are connected, how much data and what kind of data nodes are sending, etc.<p>In general I agree though.

But many of those feedbacks are complex, poorly understood, and hard to model.  That is one of the reasons why predictions have large error bars on them.<p><i>I know it is complicated but the 'conventional wisdom' has been that the best climate models take all these feedback mechanisms into consideration and predict a catastrophic increase in temperatures and that the science is 'settled' on this. We've been told over and over again that the models are trustworthy and beyond criticism. All the radical regulatory and economic policy recommendations are based on these models being correct. Anyone who doubts this is labeled as a 'denier' and politely escorted out of the room.</i><p>There are stupid people on both sides, and certainly a lot of people state certainties that go way beyond what scientists would consider settled.<p><i>And yet, you say that the land temperatures are not increasing as predicted by these trustworthy models. Hmmm.</i><p>They are not increasing as fast as the median prediction.  But they are well within the error bars that we've had all along.<p>This is a disconnect between scientific consensus and popular belief that we've seen before in other fields, like evolution.  Science, by its very nature, always has a lot of rough edges and unexpected bobbles.  Scientists focus on these.  In their discussions of all of the ways in which they have failed to perfectly understand, and how they can understand better, they say lots of things that can be (and are!) cherrypicked for propaganda among people who think that the scientists are dead wrong.  But when you trace back the quotes to the source, and look at the overwhelming bulk of the research, you realize that the scientists actually had broad agreement all along (with occasional exceptional data points).<p>The scientist who wrote the article this discussion is about would be an exceptional data point.  Fred Hoyle's rejection of the big bang theory would be a similar one.  So would the creationist beliefs of Kurt Wise and Timothy H. Heaton.  (Both got PhDs in geology from Harvard and studied under Stephen J. Gould.)<p>I list these exceptions not to dismiss them.  But to say that you cannot understand the nature of scientific consensus without understanding that not all scientists will agree with it.  And the nature of science done right is that people who disagree, but who manage to maintain the forms and standards of science, are permitted to maintain their arguments until the day that they die.  Other scientists may disagree and shake their heads.  You may get articles like <a href=""http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/dawkins_21_4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/dawkins_21_4.html</a> written in disbelief.  But the contrary argument is allowed to be made.  Is allowed to be heard.  And if evidence is on its side, will eventually be allowed to overturn what people had thought settled.  This is part of the scientific process.<p>However scientific history shows that while we celebrate people on the scientific fringe who proved to be right, the smart money wouldn't generally bet that that fringe beliefs were right.  And at this point, denying the reality of anthropogenic global warming is very much a fringe belief.  (Though one that will see you well rewarded by some powerful economic interests.)",1369979436

But that warming is insufficient to create the run-away warming predicted in climate models.<p>The increases necessary to generate the catastrophic scenarios that you (and many others describe) requires that there be an aggregate positive feedback mechanism in the climate system to magnify the CO2 warming (the anthropomorphic warming). If you read any of the literature you'll see this refered to as the 'climate sensitivity'.<p>No one knows the actual climate sensitivity relative to CO2 concentrations.  No one knows what all the various positive and negative feedback mechanisms are.  These are all suppositions by climate scientists that are plugged into their models in order to make the models accurate output the <i>historical</i> record.  Then there is a grand leap of faith that says that the models will accurate predict the <i>future</i> record.  Except that for the last 10-20 years, the models have been <i>wrong</i>.  CO2 has increased but the temperature has not changed according to the models prediction.<p>The original article says:<p><i>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported in 2007 that the short-term temperature rise would most likely be 1-3C (1.8-5.4F).<p>But in this new analysis, by only including the temperatures from the last decade, the projected range would be 0.9-2.0C.</i><p>So the models will be tweaked (for example by reducing the climate sensitivity) in order to generate output that matches the new historical record which has 10-20 years of no statistically significant warming.<p>The problem with all this is that the models can <i>always</i> be tweaked to match the historical record while at the same time generating whatever future prediction you want.

Thereby letting you dismiss what scientists agree on without even looking at their evidence.<p>If you know the science, then you'll understand that predicting exactly what the weather will be on one particular day in one month is fundamentally impossible.  But predicting what it is likely to average out to in June in Los Angeles over the next decade is both possible, and routinely done (albeit with significant error bars).  There is absolutely no contradiction between these two facts.<p>Let me illustrate with a good example showing how scientists can understand both the predictability of climate and the unpredictability of weather at the same time.  I will illustrate with an important example that is not widely understood by the lay public.<p>If you know what the Hadley cells are, you can predict at what approximate latitude we'll have jet streams, and why.  (Google that term if you don't know what a Hadley cell is - they aren't that complex.)  You'll also be able to predict that the jet streams will cause weather to follow them, resulting in (for instance) a general west to east flow of weather over much of the USA and Canada.  The fun part is that if you know more fluid mechanics, you can <i>also</i> show that the exact location of the jet stream is chaotic.  There will be bends and kinks of with a predictable wavelength (about 2x the width of North America if you are interested) and a generally predictable amplitude, but entirely unpredictable location.  Those bends will cause warm weather to be pulled north in one place, and south in another.  (Therefore when the East Coast is unseasonably cold, the West Coast tends to be unseasonably warm, and vice versa.)  But you can't predict WHERE those bends will actually be.<p>So this tells us a lot about climate (for instance where it will be wet, where you have rain shadows, etc).  It tells us a lot about causes of significant variation, including how big the variation tends to be.  But it also says that we can know nothing about which way the variation will go in New York City next October.<p>Your argument boils down to, ""You can't even tell me what New York City will be like next October, you obviously aren't doing science here!""  Which is simply ridiculous, since in fact the mechanics, average, and average variation are all understood along with the reasons why we cannot get more exact answers!<p>Everything that I am describing is standard and has been known for decades.  In fact I learned it from my fluid mechanics text over 20 years ago.<p>Please stop using the, ""We can't predict the weather so this can't be settled science"" fallacy.  It is a cheap cop-out to avoid listening to what actually is known by smart people who have devoted their lives to studying the subject.<p>(Oh, and you learned something kind of fun.  The next time you look on a weather map and see the jet stream, you'll know why it isn't running straight across.  And just watch - if you pay attention over the next few months you'll notice unseasonable weather on one coast of North America that is the opposite direction of unseasonable weather on the other.

5796967,comment,5783124,5784491,1,0,rlanday,,,"Anyone who describes GameCube as a failure without saying the same of the Xbox is either being intentionally dishonest or smoking crack. The GameCube wildly, wildly successful like the PlayStation 2, but it sold something like 22 million units versus 24 million for the original Xbox; critically, Im pretty sure Nintendo at least made money on it, versus Microsoft apparently still showing a loss for the Xbox division overall, over a decade after the first Xbox was released:
<a href=""http://www.vg247.com/2013/01/07/xbox-360-and-ps3-losses-total-8-billion-ex-sony-employee-paints-grim-future/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vg247.com/2013/01/07/xbox-360-and-ps3-losses-tota...</a><p>Can you imagine what pundits would say if Apple released a new product that didnt immediately make money hand over fist, let alone pissed away this much money over more than a decade? Sales are emphatically not what matters here.<p>I have no idea what youre talking about when you say Nintendos returning to the Gamecube philosophy with the Wii U. The GameCube was a relatively powerful (more powerful than the wildly successful PS2, and pretty close to the Xbox) system that had a pretty standard controller, used (mini) optical discs, which was a first for Nintendo. It didnt fail miserably like the Xbox and Xbox 360 have (the Xbox 360 hardware having had a special problem with failure), unless were still smoking crack, but it also didnt sell 100 million units like the Wii or PlayStation 2. The Wii was not very powerful for the time, but had a unique controller and otherwise appealed to casual gaming, and has now sold about 100 million units. Nintendo has undeniably won this generation in the marketplace, even if the Wii doesnt appeal to hardcore gamers with inflated perceptions of self-importance. Theres actually kind of a pattern: the most powerful system never sells the most units (e.g., Wii vs PS3/Xbox 360, PS2 vs. GameCube/Xbox, PlayStation vs. N64, SNES vs. Genesis I think), so while this seems like a risky strategy, it probably isnt really.<p>I think the Wii U exactly continues the Wii philosophy. The problems Nintendo is having so far with Wii U sales probably stem from a combination of poor marketing, to the point where people dont even realize its a new system because Nintendo has gone too far trying to tie it to the Wii brand, and a lack of titles for their loyal audience who buys Nintendos systems to play Nintendos games. I own a Wii U and not a 3DS, but it seems like the 3DS is getting a lot more first-party titles than the Wii U has so far. Once Nintendo starts getting out stuff like Pikmin 3, a new Super Smash Bros. game, a new Mario Kart game, an HD Zelda game, a hardcore 3D Pokmon adventure, game or whatever, I think the system will start looking a lot more attractive. Its kind of too bad they just released a Luigis Mansion sequel, a Paper Mario title, and an Ocarina of Time remake for the 3DS because they probably couldve used some of that for the Wii U.",1369976780

5796958,comment,5789637,5791481,2,0,duaneb,,,"Well if you're reducing formulas for creativity down to stuff like mind maps, then of course you're scornful. These are pretty well known and accepted solutions to creativity. Almost certainly very far from the optimal one (if that exists), but still:<p>1. Crowdsourcing, especially incentivised via capitalism.<p>2. Drugs.<p>3. Education. Yes, this can also stifle creativity, hence why we don't want everyone learning the same curriculum. But there is no surer way to stop creativity than to allow redundant knowledge to develop twice (which is not to say that we shouldn't do this as part of education, just with direction).<p>4. Motivation, desperation, i.e. lack of comfort/pain: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Burroughs#Beginning_of_literary_career"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Burroughs#Beginning_...</a><p>5.

Logic is pretty damn good for solving problems.<p>So, no, there's no general algorithm to produce 'creative' thoughts, much less against a given solution, but we have learned an immense amount in the past 10k years on how to actively stimulate creativity. Just because many creative ideas were not encountered methodically means nothing but that creativity is not restricted to intent, and the fact that some ideas that we are actively pursuing that will require creative thought (by definition) can't be obviously solved just means we haven't done so yet, not that we cannot methodically find the solution.<p>Going even further, I think the rate at which humans create is far more proof that there exists some general algorithm for creativity than for its non-existence; in fact, the only proof I'm aware of that attempts to do so is the incompleteness theorems/the halting problem proof. And even those put no bounds on how much knowledge is off limits to us, assuming that we are deterministic and thus bound by those proofs. The human race has more issues with the deluge of research outpacing our ability to comprehend itperhaps we should work more on understanding existing knowledge rather than creating new knowledge.",1369976613

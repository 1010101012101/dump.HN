Statistically speaking hurricane prepping is much bigger deal in America than survivalism but yet the TV media campaign leaves outsiders with an exaggerated impression of the situation.  Some think this occurred just because it makes for good TV, but I think it&#x27;s also part of a larger campaign to sell more hamburgers and wal-mart stock.<p>> While if there is a strong social safety net (as in many places in Europe), and you believe the government will be effective at responding to a natural disasters, then there&#x27;s less need of a belief to take on the heavier burden of individual planning.<p>I don&#x27;t think that the social safety net is as strong in Europe for the exact reason that you think it is.  In other words in Europe nobody has a choice but to rely solely on the government to stabilize the situation after a major emergency because they don&#x27;t have the firearms they would need to restore peace on their own.<p>In America however it&#x27;s a different story because hundreds of thousands if not millions of veterans currently own rifles strikingly similar to those they carried in the armed forces, lacking only the full-automatic selector switch. Their brothers, sisters, parents, friends, and neighbors who did not serve in the military are often just as familiar with the weapons, if not the tactics.<p>Many of these Soldiers and Marines have special operations training. They are former warriors with experience at conducting irregular warfare and counter-terrorism operations in dangerous urban environments.   In the Middle East these troops were frequently tasked with restoring order to urban areas exploding in internecine strife. Today these former military men and women understand better than anyone the life-or-death difference between being armed and organized versus unarmed and disorganized.  One could even say it&#x27;s part of our culture.<p>That&#x27;s a real social safety net in my view, and since we have this safety net we like to enhance it, by taking simple steps to be more prepared, while in Europe I get the feeling that some people feel like &#x27;why even bother&#x27; ?",1452849201
10908103,comment,10906232,10907837,0,0,dalke,,,"I double-checked, and I still see nothing about the <i>process</i> of how to identify the risk level.<p>For example, it says &#x27;For example, do you live in a 100-year flood zone?&#x27; but does not describe how to find that out. It doesn&#x27;t mention the term &#x27;flood map&#x27;, or where one finds a flood map. Do you go to the library? Is it easy to find online?<p>I tried now for Santa Fe, NM. <a href=""http://www.newfloodmap.com/mountain/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newfloodmap.com/mountain/</a> doesn&#x27;t list Santa Fe county, and in any case I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s a legit site or a value added site trying to scam money out of me by looking official and packing together resources that are freely available. I gave up trying to find it online - I think I can get it from City Hall.<p>Regarding chemical risks, as I pointed out, it doesn&#x27;t mention the Local Emergency Planning Committee. Quoting Wikipedia:<p>> Under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs) must develop an emergency response plan, review the plan at least annually, and provide information about chemicals in the community to citizens.<p>Someone who is looking for a guide to help with preparation, and doesn&#x27;t know to keep extra water around, is likely also someone who needs help to map out plausible risks, and could use a pointer to legally mandated resources that are supposed to be available to help with those risks.<p>Then again, if I don&#x27;t believe the government is going to bail me out of problems, why should I believe that those government maps and government information is worthwhile for my planning? Are they reliable? What is the experience of others with that information?<p>As a case in point, regarding &#x27;relevant risks&#x27;, the text says &quot;Although we are entering the realm of very unlikely events, if you worry about encountering an overturned chemical tanker..&quot;<p>This would be an excellent example of how to do a cost-benefit analysis. A first approximation is easy - how many people have been killed or injured by a chemical tanker where a mask would have helped? What&#x27;s the probability of that happening to the reader? What does a mask cost, including the need to recharge or replace it? If it&#x27;s a 1:1 billion chance per year, and it costs $10/year, then that&#x27;s saying that your life is worth about $200 million to you.<p>But if that&#x27;s so, then perhaps other things, like storing important documents, or copies of important documents, in a safety deposit box is much more worthwhile. Or driving at a more sedate speed (the first paragraph of safety tip #2 is very true!) Or remembering to not drive into flowing water, which kills many more people every year than gas from an overturned chemical tanker.<p>> board up windows in locations prone to severe weather ...  I&#x27;m sort of struggling to pinpoint the nature of the complaint :-(<p>My complaint is that the document tries to take on a lot, and yet does too little.<p>There are a lot of resources for many of these disasters. There&#x27;s no way your document can cover all of the things to worry about with a hurricane. You <i>have</i> to point to more complete resources elsewhere. It&#x27;s not a simple matter of &quot;boarding up windows&quot;, since that&#x27;s only one of several options. I mentioned hurricane shutters; my parents had corrugated metal shutters for the window, stored under the house because when a storm is coming, everyone is trying to get boards for their windows. While on the other hand, a hurricane is more predictable. It&#x27;s okay to wait until the last 24 hours to fill up the tub with water to use for flushing the toilet, which is not an option in earthquake country.<p>Accept that your document will be incomplete, and point people to where to go for more information.<p>The most common major threats (tornado, blizzard, hurricane, flooding, wildfire, sinkhole (yes, I&#x27;m from Florida), earthquake, avalanche, volcano/lahar flow, tsunami, etc.) all have official guidelines for how to prepare for them. Use them, and add to them. Don&#x27;t try to be an all-in-one solution.",1452849116

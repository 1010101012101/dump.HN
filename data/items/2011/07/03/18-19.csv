2724302,comment,2723675,2723831,13,0,DennisP,,,"Thorium reactors should be quite a bit cheaper. Light-water reactors operate at 160 atmospheres of pressure. They need a very strong reactor vessel, which currently can only be forged by a single facility in Japan. They need a large containment dome because if a pipe breaks, that high-pressure water will flash into steam with a thousand times the volume. They use lots of redundant emergency active cooling mechanisms. Some of them have giant slabs of ice inside the containment dome, which reduce the volume of steam if it's released but have to be constantly refrigerated, to keep them frozen in close proximity to a nuclear reactor core.<p>LWRs are resupplied every year with expensive fabricated fuel rods, which are non-standard and can only be purchased from the company that sold the reactor. The fuel rods are complicated because they have to withstand a thousand-degree temperature gradient, and the fuel pellets are prone to cracking from the production of xenon gas. Xenon and other reaction products prevent the use of more than one percent or so of the energy potential of the nuclear fuel, another reason the rods are frequently replaced, and the reason we have so much nasty nuclear waste.<p>The nuclear industry makes most of its revenue from selling those fuel rods.<p>LFTRs operate at atmospheric pressure. No super-strong steel, no containment dome, no ice. It's a liquid fuel, so no proprietary fuel rods. Xenon just bubbles out of it.<p>The fuel has a strong ""negative coefficient,"" meaning the reaction slows down as it gets hotter. If it nevertheless gets too hot, a salt plug melts and all the fuel drains into a passive cooling tank. No need for all those active cooling systems.<p>On top of that, LFTRs operate at higher temperature, so the turbine is more efficient, and the waste heat can be used to desalinate seawater. They don't require water cooling. As a bonus, marketable reaction products can be separated from the liquid fuel (<a href=""http://flibe-energy.com/products/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flibe-energy.com/products/</a>).<p>Misguided government regulation is the main problem, but Sorenson's company plans to get around that by selling to the military first.",1309719037

And since authors can figure this out before starting to work, there's less production of works than beneficial.<p>In other words: Nobody would have spend the money to make movies like Lords of the Rings, or whatever you fancy.<p>The free market argument applies in a world with ownership, too: Those who paid the price for a work are assumed to be better off, otherwise they wouldn't have agreed to the bargain. If they would want works without ownership, they can always assemble, throw their money into one pot, and have works made for them.<p>Since they don't do this, an average, the incentive of having works with no ownership can't be that great.<p>You got to admit that every author is the possessor of his work, even in a world without ownership, since he possesses the first copy.

Once they had those working, everybody went with what they knew, and thorium advocates got fired. Then people forgot about thorium.<p>At this point, NRC regulations assume solid fuel, and the nuclear industry makes most of its money from selling complex fabricated fuel rods.<p>However, there was a small liquid-fluoride reactor actually working back in the 60s.<p>The main technical objection I've seen is corrosion from the liquid-salt fuel. Sorenson claims there's an alloy that makes it a non-issue.",1309716533

Is is just parsing my tweets and recommending stuffs based on keywords? Where does the recommendation data come from?<p>EDIT: One more thing. It's pretty quick compared to some other services which try to read the tweets and do something with that. Is it really fetching and processing all the tweets before recommending?<p>EDIT: Ok, the above question was kinda dumb. Since it uses hunch, so it does not need to get the tweets any way. But, would be interesting to know how hunch does that, because considering that twecommend sends the request to hunch and hunch responds after doing all the processing, it is still quick.",1309716499

The reason Google is attacking these companies is simple: they have become clear threats to Google's core business - not search, but targeted advertising on the web. Apple's race to dominance to the mobile space with its walled-garden approach and app- and vertical-search-based model were threatening the whole open, web-based and ads-driven model; Microsoft's stronghold on browser market with an ancient browser was holding the web hostage and killing the potential of web as a service serving platform; Facebook keeps valuable information that is not accessible to Google bot and may even be able to develop the next big thing to replace search, not to mention that it is sucking the best talent; and it has been very clear that local advertising is where the future growth of targeted advertising will be from.<p>Google is being offensive and aggressive, and they are not comfortable about it when their core business - not search but serving ads - is being threatened.",1309716470

Sure, extended warranties on consumer goods and so on are things to be avoided, but insurance would still exist in a world of informed and rational people.<p>When you buy insurance you get reduced expected value (over going it alone) but you also reduce the variance - the cost of driving a car around becomes a somewhat predictable constant rather than there being the ever-present risk of a large cost.<p>Yes, if you are in a financial position where the cost of a car is something you can take on the chin, then it is up there with extended warranties as something to avoid.

It is not a wager at all.  A wager is when you bet some amount of money on the hopes that you'll get back a bigger amount of money.  It introduces greater uncertainty and volatility into your financial situation: you'll take either a gain or a loss depending on the outcome of some not yet determined event.<p><i>Not</i> buying insurance is a wager with life.  You wager your belongings, and if nothing happens to them you ""win"" the money you saved by not buying insurance.  Like any wager, you have greater uncertainty and volatility than if you hadn't taken the wager.<p>Buying insurance is the anti-wager: you have a known outcome (you'll be out the premium but still have your belongings), which gives you decreased uncertainty and volatility.  Yes, insurance companies make a profit by charging more in premiums than the expected value of their claims.  But the alternative is to make a big wager with life (the value of your house, car, etc) for a relatively small return (the savings from not paying an insurance premium).<p>(This is ignoring any of the practical conveniences of having a pro handle all the logistics in the case of an accident).",1309716075

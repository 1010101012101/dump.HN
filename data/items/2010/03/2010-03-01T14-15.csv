They added a lot of functionality to VS (unit testing, TFS support etc.), but they never added more refactorings, which I and surely others would appreciate. ReSharper's refactoring functionality is right now the only reason I would consider to install the add-in, but since I didn't need any of the <i>advanced</i> refactorings yet, I'm keeping ReSharper away from my VS installation. I get my work done without it, so I see no need to bloat VS any more :) But, I surely can recommend to install it for various other reasons, e.g. I stumbled upon a few interesting things thanks to its suggestions.",1267455482

Since the law firm ceased to exist (heller ehrman), even the option to even pay $600/month for that premium care lasted only a few months. Independent of some sort of union, my cost will be around that same $600/month for the lowest level of HMO with large copays, and this is what I did for a few months before deciding it didn't make sense.<p>I am relatively young (33), relatively healthy (knock on wood), and I have a decent enough network in India such that I can drop in on a moment's notice.  In India, healthcare is 10-30% of the cost for similar care (American run hospitals, often by universities like Harvard). There are other concerns, but purely on cost, its actually cheaper to fly from NY to India or another country and have many popular medical operations performed. An MRI costs $1500 here, in India its $100.  A broken arm can cost $25,000* here with hospitalization, less than $1000 in India.<p>This leaves me wide-open for catastrophic events, for which I wish I could buy ""urgent-only"" insurance to cover this small probability.  I'd like to insure my urgent care in the US but for anything else that requires a doctor and is not urgent, I'll take care of it elsewhere, likely planned around vacation.<p>Some people seem to have decent rates and plans for their small companies, but I'm finding quoted rates much higher for very new companies or individuals than they used to be.<p>(* edit: I've never broken my arm but I got the 25k # from a reddit conversation about ridiculous emergency room hourly costs for the uninsured. A quick google search for ""broken arm cost"" reveals that though 25k may be high, ppl have reported 20k and 5 figures seems to be the norm -- looks like it depends on the amount of emergency room time req'd.)",1267455238

To be profitable, they need the same thing that every biz needs - more revenues than expenses.<p>You can be profitable insuring any group - you just need to charge members of that group more than it costs to cover them.<p>If you think that any group is being hosed, set up an insurance company that covers them and no one else.  Charge them what you think they cost (plus a bit so you're profitable) and steal customers from companies that charge more. If you're right, both you and your customers will benefit significantly.<p>Insurance is a way to reduce variance.  However, the value of reducing variance has limits.  If price charged to a group significantly exceeds their perceived average costs, they won't pay and will go bare.<p>How much are you willing to subsidize someone else's costs?",1267454999

The body adapts quickly so while 5 sets of 5 might work for a few weeks you eventually need to change it up.  Plus your joints, tendons and ligaments get tired always lifting heavy.<p>Cardio has nothing to do with 'toning.'  The old saying is 'abs are made in the kitchen not in the gym.'  If you want to look tone (horrible term but we'll go with it) you need to have some muscle and then remove the fat from over top of it.  The easiest way to remove fat is the cut calories.  You can burn calories through exercise, but not nearly as much as people think.<p>Dips and pullups is nothing close to enough for a well rounded workout.  If you want to do a workout without a gym Google bodyweight training.  If you have access to a gym then look at the books 'Starting Strength' or 'New Rules of Lifting.'  Both are good books by excellent authors and give you plenty of workout plans.  With either, expect to spend about an hour in the gym 3 times per week.",1267454878

1158747,comment,1158589,1158705,0,0,tokenadult,,,"Neither has a validated IQ score. NO ONE with an IQ score reported to be above 160 has a validated IQ score. IQ test scores in that range have never been properly validated, on any IQ test of any era.<p>It is well known that reliability of IQ tests is at its worst at the highest level of IQ scores. The author of the Stanford-Binet form L-M (the test that Marilyn vos Savant, among others, took to get a sky-high unvalidated score) was among the first to say so:<p>""The reader should not lose sight of the fact that a test with even a high reliability yields scores which have an appreciable probable error. The probable error in terms of mental age is of course larger with older than with young children because of the increasing spread of mental age as we go from younger to older groups. For this reason it has been customary to express the P.E. [probable error] of a Binet score in terms of I.Q., since the spread of Binet I.Q.'s is fairly constant from age to age. However, when our correlation arrays [between Form L and Form M] were plotted for separate age groups they were all discovered to be distinctly fan-shaped. Figure 3<p><a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/Terman%201937%20Figure%203.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/Terman%201937%20Figure%203.gif</a><p>is typical of the arrays at every age level.<p>""From Figure 3 it becomes clear that the probable error of an I.Q. score is not a constant amount, but a variable which increases as I.Q. increases. It has frequently been noted in the literature that gifted subjects show greater I.Q. fluctuation than do clinical cases with low I.Q.'s . . . . we now see that this trend is inherent in the I.Q. technique itself, and might have been predicted on logical grounds."" (Terman & Merrill, 1937, p. 44)<p>To validate an IQ test (a test that purports to estimate ""general intelligence""), one must first reach a consensus among test designers about some sign of intelligence that is detectable outside the testing room. Over the years, psychologists have proposed various behavioral characteristics of human beings as signs that those human beings are ""intelligent,"" with entering challenging, high-income occupations that require a lot of higher schooling being one criterion proposed for adult IQ tests, and being precocious in school and having good grades and good teacher ratings being one criterion that is proposed for child IQ tests.<p>One finds a sample of persons to take a new brand of test in its norming administration, and rates those persons by external criteria of ""intelligence,"" weighting those criteria by consensus, and then checks the rank-order correlation between the ranking of the test-takers yielded by the IQ test and the ranking of the test-takers yielded by the validation criteria. There will NEVER be a perfect (""1.0"") correlation between the test and the validation criterion, just as there is never a perfect correlation between IQ scores on one occasion and IQ scores on another occasion on the same brand of IQ test by the same group of test-takers.<p>There is enough play in the joints in both IQ test scoring (whatever the brand of test) and ranking people by other validation criteria (whatever they are), that strictly speaking one can't say that there is any all-time, universally significant ranking of human beings by intelligence. But a close-enough-for-government-work validation study would show an IQ test having correlations above .80, and perhaps even above .90, in comparison with previous brands of IQ tests, or in comparison with subsets of its own item content, or in comparison with some well regarded external validation criterion.<p>For reasons mentioned above, there is especially little reliability, and hence especially little validity, for IQ scores far above the population mean, and thus it's very hard to devise a validation criterion that would sort, say, members of Mensa<p><a href=""http://www.mensa.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mensa.org/</a><p>or members of the Study of Exceptional Talent<p><a href=""http://cty.jhu.edu/set/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cty.jhu.edu/set/index.html</a><p>or members of the Davidson Young Scholars program<p><a href=""http://www.davidsongifted.org/youngscholars/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davidsongifted.org/youngscholars/</a><p>into their ""true"" rank order by IQ, not to mention that IQ scores for the same individual can and do change over the course of life.<p>Lewis Terman's longitudinal study of high-IQ elementary-age pupils showed that many of those young people did not qualify as ""gifted"" on a subsequent test that Terman gave them at high school age. But he kept them in the study group anyway.<p>Shurkin, Joel N. (1992). Terman's Kids: The Groundbreaking Study of How the Gifted Grow Up. Boston: Little, Brown.<p>An especially odd result of the Terman study is that Terman tested and rejected for inclusion in his study two children whose IQ scores were below his cut-off line who later went on to win Nobel prizes: William Shockley, who co-invented the transistor, and physicist Luis Alvarez. None of the children included in the study ever won a Nobel prize. The book by Shurkin I have just cited here is a good corrective on many misconceptions about IQ, and has an excellent section on attempts by one of Terman's study associates to estimate--by extremely dubious methods that have never been validated--the IQ scores of historical persons.<p>P.S. As Stephen Hawking says about IQ:<p>""Q: What is your I.Q.?<p>""A: I have no idea. People who boast about their I.Q. are losers.""<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/12/magazine/12QUESTIONS.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/12/magazine/12QUESTIONS.html</a>",1267454087

I would like to get into Olympic lifts but I have three slipped discs from overloading a hip sled in high school. I'm pretty strong otherwise, but my legs are messed up. My injury is under control but when I do the wrong thing I can't walk for a week.<p>There is a dedicated olympic lifting school blocks from where I live, but in my experience almost nobody knows anything about how to train with a back injury. I'd like to go in at least prepared with the right questions to ask.<p>I know that Paul Chek has rehabilitated many of my favorite athletes. For instance, Danny Way broke his neck surfing, and Chek got his body back in shape for his crazy mega ramp stuff. I was thinking of finding a Chek certified trainer, but unfortunately it seems that whole scene has veered off into borderline cult territory.<p>This is really NOT hacker news but since the topic is here I thought I'd pose the question.

1158675,comment,1158166,1158427,0,0,philk,,,"The Rippetoe stuff should generally be applied such that you gradually increase your intake until you're putting on enough weight, and back off if  you're gaining fat too quickly.  And for the majority of Rippetoe's target audience, that is young skinny guys, getting enough calories is more important than the right calories.<p>I'm curious as to whether you just started drinking a gallon of milk every day from the get go?  Because I imagine that adding ~2800 kCal to your maintenance diet would tend to pile on rather more fat than usual.<p>Also I'd assume that the average HNer could put together a diet that's pretty reasonable with minimal preparation, however, here's a few pointers I've followed...<p>General diet guidelines:<p>a) For optimal health, the fewer calories you eat without starving or failing to satisfy nutritional requirements the better (ie caloric restriction).  Hence eating to gain weight, even muscle, probably necessitates a sub-optimal strategy.<p>b) Body transformation is made in the kitchen, not the gym.  If you eat less than maintenance calories you'll lose weight, more than maintenance calories you'll gain weight and make better strength gains.  Heavy weightlifting is a must to begin with, but your work in the kitchen determines your outcome.<p>c) Don't eat processed food.  It's normally High GI and full of crap [1].<p>d) Eat six small meals each day, at even intervals.  This seems to work better than three large meals.  Of course, if you're bulking, then you'll be eating six large meals each day and feeling sick most of the time.<p>e) Eat lots of non-starchy vegetables and some fruit.  Vegetables implies things like broccoli and spinach.  For fruit aim for things like berries.  More vegetables than fruit because you can overdo the fructose.<p>f) Eat plenty of fish, nuts, avocadoes and other healthy fats.  If you need to boost your calories further a shot (30 mL) of olive oil is ~ 250 kCal and only takes a minute.<p>g) Eat fewer carbs, and make sure they're low GI.  Hence things like lentils, brown rice, quinoa, etc.  Eat carbs early in the day as they seem to give you more energy.<p>h) Another fine protein source is skinless chicken breasts.  I boil mine and throw away the fat that floats to the top.  Eggs [2] can also provide lots of protein.<p>i) Full fat milk is awesome for gaining weight as it is quick to drink and provides quick calories.<p>j) Diets continue in perpetuity.  It's like showering or brushing your teeth.  You don't brush your teeth twelve times a day for a month then say ""well, that's taken care of"" and never brush them again.<p>k) Post workout (for all the good post workout nutrition does) drink something with carbs and protein.  I generally go for a liter of milk.<p>l) If you're trying to reduce your caloric intake, replace food with things that are calorically sparse.  If you eat a big salad [3] before each meal you'll reduce the number of calories you can get through without feeling hungry.<p>m) If you're trying to eat more and can't get through the food, buy a really good blender and drink as much as possible.<p>[1] I'd chiefly be worried about salt and high-fructose corn syrup.  A lot of the threatening looking stuff on the label isn't, but it's a pain in the ass to figure that out.<p>[2] I'm not sure whether they're good or bad for you today.<p>[3] With no dressing or something with minimal calories if you aren't hard enough.<p>Potentially many of these could be debated as nutrition is a bit of a clusterfuck of contradictory information, but I'm reasonably confident in them.",1267452135

5112819,comment,5111936,5112646,1,0,malyk,,,"You are definitely correct.  My post was a little snarky and written way too quickly to get any real point across.<p>My real point is that, regardless of whether or not wage stagnation has occurred, the ""middle class"" is not in a good position. Median household income is $52,000.  You can survive on that while raising 2 kids, paying rent or a mortgage, and paying for a car if you are smart about it.  But you aren't very well positioned to get ahead and you certainly aren't in a position to have a couple of smartphones, premium cable tv on a big flat screen tv, with the newest computers, etc. like we are taught to aspire to.<p>Yes, there is more tech, better healthcare, etc., but your money goes a lot less far than it did when you could have a single worker earning enough to afford the ""same"" (relatively) overall quality of life.  It's not a perfect comparison by any means, but saying wage stagnation doesn't exist and therefore we shouldn't care about it seems utterly bizarre when you look at what most of the nation has to live on.<p>I just can't wrap my head around how anyone can look at this article and especially that horrible infographic that the WSJ published and think anything except how out of touch and frankly stupid people are about the reality of our collective situation.",1359068386

Prisons should not be used with the expectation of reducing criminal behaviour.<p>2. On the basis of the present results, excessive use of incarceration has enormous cost implications.<p>3. In order to determine who is being adversely affected by prison, it is incumbent upon prison officials to implement repeated, comprehensive assessments of offenders attitudes, values, and behaviours while incarcerated.<p>4. The primary justification of prison should be to incapacitate offenders (particularly, those of a chronic, higher risk nature) for reasonable periods and to exact retribution.""<p>Summary points 1 and 4 are key: Prisons are not effective deterrence, but they are great tools for indirect retribution suffered by the victim(s).<p>Also in response to your last comment ""I'd be somewhat shocked [..]"": There are plenty of things that goes against simple human intuition--that's what science is for.

Especially since CPI is corrected for that already. Also consider certain goods have gone down in quality due to being mass produced instead of hand tailored. ""Fresh"" produce are more available but often old and stale because they come from far away.  Inflation is overestimated on these types of items.<p>""health benefits, pensions, paid leaves and the rest now amount to an average of almost 31% of total compensation for all civilian workers""<p>Health care is costlier, securing a pension is costlier (due to low investment returns), more paid leaves are probably due to both adults working in a family which is unsustainable in times of family crisis. This is related to:<p>""Third and most important, the average hourly wage is held down by the great increase of women and immigrants into the workforce over the past three decades""<p>So let me get this straight, previously a single income was enough to sustain a family of often 5 or more and now you need two incomes for a family of only 3 or 4 and this dude thinks that makes people feel richer?? Also consider that one reason people don't have 5 kids anymore is that they wouldn't be able to afford them and can't take care of them because both parents have to be working.<p>""spending by households on many of modern life's ""basics"" fell from 53% of disposable income in 1950 to 44% in 1970 to 32% today."" Is that for median households or is this number skewed by including the super rich in the average? I'm suspicious that this isn't specified. Also this is a complex number with lots of caveats. For a single earner family (remember this used to be sufficient),  is this still true?<p>""Before airlines were deregulated, for example, commercial jet travel was a luxury that ordinary Americans seldom enjoyed.""<p>The fact that technology has made air travel's costs more in line with other forms of travel, doesn't make a person richer. Sure it gives that person more options, and some quality of life improvements if he or she chooses these options. However, if a median worker could afford only a few train tickets a year in 1980 he still can't afford many more train or plane tickets today with his dwindling salary.",1359067638

When you're debugging/developing a large and expensive workflow, you absolutely must have the ability to say things like:\n - run only this step, I'm debugging it\n - I've changed implementation of this step, re-build it and everything that depends on it\n - build everything except this branch, it's expensive and I don't need to rebuild it that often (example: model training)<p>Other examples of intractable problems in Make would be timestamped dependency resolution between local and HDFS files. If Make can't look at HDFS, it can't say if the step needs to be built or not. I don't think you can fix it with external commands.<p>But generally, search for intractable problems is a futile one. Remember, everything you can code in Java, you can code in a Turing machine. :)",1359067544

5112755,comment,5110549,5110549,3,0,saurik,,,"As much as I hate the APK file format, this is not a valid reason why, as Google covered this. When you build your APK, you are more than welcome to simply not compress certain files, as the .zip file format has an algorithm that is just ""store"". In fact, the SDK does this by default for certain kinds of commonly-mapped files that don't benefit much from compression anyway, such as .mp3. I am not certain if aapt lets you specify other files easily, but you can always just add your own stored content using the zip tool itself.<p>Then, the normal build process has you run ""zipalign"" on the resulting file, which will guarantee that uncompressed files fall on boundaries that would make them efficient to memory map directly out of the APK. Finally, the AssetManager API provides an openFd() method that will open a file (which <i>must</i> be uncompressed, or you will get an IOException), return a file descriptor for that file, and tell you the offset into that file where the data for the file you wanted starts (an API sufficient to describe a range of an APK).",1359067391

Fixed data - Your business has an upper limit on how much data it realistically can collect.  How to design a statistical procedure that makes reasonably good decisions while remaining within that limit.<p>3. Simple test - How to use Bayes' Theorem to design very simple and straightforward test criteria, where every A/B test has a known cost up front.<p>4. Bayesian statistics - How a Bayesian approach compares to the previous ones.  Where the sticking points are, what its advantages are.<p>5.

Both of my two older sons have netbook computers and mobile phones (not the Apple brand) even though our family income is solidly in the range described by the article. My second son recently mail-ordered computer parts and assembled a new desktop PC for my wife, which is quite a blessing. The simple point of fact is that young people today have opportunity to enjoy goods and services that were unavailable and unimaginable to their parents at the same age. All four of my children have had opportunity to obtain good education that prepares them for productive adult life--my oldest son is already working full-time as a programmer for a start-up. We have spent out of pocket more than most American families to pursue educational opportunities for them at the primary and secondary level of education, largely through homeschooling, but we can afford what we did with a middle-class income. We live in a nice house (rented, in our case) in a peaceful, crime-free neighborhood, and travel as we have occasion to travel. Our lifestyle has improved over the lifestyle I grew up with.<p>As a younger Baby Boomer, I am prime political fodder for appeals to ""protect Social Security."" Yet I support entitlement reform, even at my short-term detriment, because I care about my children. I do agree that young people today need to have older people like me drain less of the money they earn through work to fund entitlements paid to me. Rather, I support reforms that raise the retirement age and age of eligibility for other old-age benefits and put more of the economy's money in the hands of working people who can best decide how to spend it, funding entitlement programs on a more actuarially sound basis. Understanding the basic facts about the economy is an important first step for hackers and other entrepreneurs to have a business environment in which they can innovate and invest. Current policies are unsustainable and anyway are based on false factual premises. Americans can buy more of what they want for fewer hours of work than ever before in human history. Hackers can keep right on innovating, because Americans will never feel like they have enough. History makes that clear.",1359065335

And at the same time, consumer debt has done up while savings have gone down.<p>Now, if worker compensation was growing significantly faster than inflation, wouldn't we expect the amount of disposable income to be higher, and hence savings and debt to be lower? Why were Americans forced to tap home equity and credit cards to continue consumption? Either prices went up, or people started consuming a lot more. The article claims disposable income went up, but if that's the case, why the credit binge? Doesn't add up.<p>Moreover, even if you ignore this, the share of national income of the bottom quintiles has been dropping monotonically over the last 30 years, but it was rising with the rest of the quintiles prior to that. That tends to indicate that broad based productivity increases were accruing benefits to workers. Now it tends to indicate that productivity increases accrue solely to capital and not labor.

It insists on accepting a directory name as the first parameter.<p>- BSD sed doesn't support the -i option in the same way as GNU sed does.<p>- Even different versions of GNU utilities are not necessarily compatible.

We are always making improvements to our models, and we need to be able to do versioning to see how the improvements change our final predictions about customer behavior, and how these stack up to reality. So in addition to versioning code, and rerunning analysis when the code is out of date we also need to keep track of different major versions of the code, and figure out exactly what needs to be recomputed.<p>We did a survey of a number of different workflow management systems such as JUG, Taverna, and Kepler.

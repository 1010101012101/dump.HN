You can get really caught up in all of the plausible contingencies, which grow disproportionately with complexity.<p>If you were to audit that oil rig inch-by-inch, you might have found dozens of things which could have led to a problem of near the same impact as the current leak.  And you might have even focused on fixing <i>all</i> of them.  But you can't presume that some other factor that you didn't notice (or couldn't have noticed given the finite nature of your knowledge) wouldn't have triggered a slightly different failure, and you can spend an enormous amount of time fixing things that would not have caused a failure.<p>Adams makes a good point - the best way to ensure the reliability of a system is to understand the functioning of the system as a whole, and beyond a certain scale of complexity, this is extremely difficult and often impossible.",1276106298

Let me sum some things up about SC2 and battle.net, completely unofficially and without inside information.<p>StarCraft II is trying some new things.  They are taking control over more of the experience than they did before.  That cheeses off a lot of people, but they have the opportunity and technology to do it and want to improve the experience in lots of ways instead of just the core game, which of course will be great.<p>The front end has been a mess by Blizzard's standards, I think.  But it will evolve and get much, much better than its beta incarnation.  StarCraft is a game that has held up for ten years plus and that is totally the intention on SC2.  Blizzard released a patch for Diablo II earlier this year, so it helps to think about the long term.<p>And finally, Battle.net is an emerging network that's also in beta in its current incarnation.  You can't serious if you think that it's not going to grow hugely in usability and capability in the next few years.  And it's not like they're going to be supporting dozens of titles.  Battle.net has got to be their avenue to making money off of non-MMO games, so they are very motivated to make it great.",1276106130

1417700,comment,1417559,1417559,0,0,phren0logy,,,"I'm coming to Clojure from doing some relatively basic scientific programming in Ruby and Python. Mostly Python. I don't have a formal background in programming, and both Ruby and Python made it easy for me to automate portions of my data analysis tasks. Python's excellent scientific libraries allowed for even further integration into my data analysis tool chain.<p>I ran into a few issues that nudged me toward Clojure:<p>1. Although Python has a richness of libraries, there were still some niche, domain-specific libraries available only in Java that look really appealing.<p>2. I looked at learning Java a few times, and I had a hard time justifying spending a lot of time learning it. The gains didn't seem that big for the tedium I was feeling doing the reading/exercises.<p>3. Lisp syntax is quick and easy to learn.<p>4. Functional programming makes more sense to me. For example my Python style involves an unreasonable amount of list comprehensions.<p>5. For scientific/numeric computing, baked in parallelism/concurrency is <i>extremely appealing.</i><p>6. I was also considering learning R, but when I saw Incanter have been hoping I could learn Clojure and make use of this excellent library.

You made it clear by using the word ""fix"".<p>For certain conditions, ""fixing"" does not work. If my arm is broken, sure you can fix it but for chronic conditions, certain lifestyle changes will have to be made and that requires the individual to be willing to undertake shifts in their behavior.
 For example, what you eat, when you eat, where you eat, how the food is cooked, when you sleep, the ambiance of your work, home and not to mention exercising etc.<p>So in that sense, the holistic medical practitioner becomes more like a guide and the individual takes on a active role.<p>For most people, this is too much to do. So they prefer Western Medicine where the mindset is, someone is going to ""fix"" me while I am busy with my life getting stressed up.

I have all my friends on Steam and I know what they are playing and can jump into their games whenever I like. While BNet2.0 won't have the large scale digital distribution system that Steam does.

Even World Of Warcraft is getting updated in the new Expansion to support some of the BNet2.0 features. The idea is to build a platform that connects all Blizzard gamers to all Blizzard games. At Blizzcon 2009 on of the VPs of Blizzard gave a demonstration of BNet2.0, talked about the vision, and where they plan to go with it. They are trying make a quality system that will be useful.<p>Lastly, BNet 2.0 will introduce a kind of Map Store.

The first one is by far the most common.<p>I'm not particularly experienced with Haskell, but my understanding is that the static typing will usually catch the second one and that more advanced static analysis (more advanced than type checking) can easily catch the third one.<p>Most important, though, is the case of the first and most common error.

1417584,comment,1415547,1415547,0,0,Rufus,,,"The dueling speculation with regard to how close (or far) you need to be from an MRI scanner ignores a few points. First, the attractive (translational) effect is not strictly a result of the strength of the magnet, it is a product of the magnet strength and the magnetic spatial gradient (or, by analogy, the 'steepness' of the magnetic field).<p>Contemporary MRI scanners use what's referred to as 'active magnetic shielding' which means that the magnetic field is 'girdled' and held closer to the scanner than it would be if we just let it follow the cube-of-the-distance drop-off rate. This increases the 'steepness' of the magnetic field, but pulls it closer to the body of the instrument.<p>One of the major factors regarding attractive force is the object that is being pulled. The longer it is (not so much the 'bigness' but the length), the greater the potential pull. The attractive force is a result of the difference between the magnetic field as experienced by one end of an object and the field at the other end. The greater the difference (a product of the steepness of the field and length of the object), the stronger the attractive force.<p>So, theoretically you could take a 2D ferromagnetic filament and, if you turned it so that it didn't cross any of the magnetic flux lines, the attractive force would = 0. Keeping the center in the same location but rotating the filament so that it crossed flux lines, presto, attractive force!<p>If you're looking for more information about magnetic projectile accidents, I suggest you check out <a href=""http://mrimetaldetector.com/blog/2010/02/mri-projectile-accidents-one-exemplar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mrimetaldetector.com/blog/2010/02/mri-projectile-acci...</a> and the other posts.",1276103813

1417573,comment,1417082,1417252,0,0,tansey,,,"This tutorial is particularly troubling, as the two examples are poorly chosen at best and dangerous at worst. The very basics of neural networks are not very tough, as it's just a black box where you give it some set of real-valued inputs and it learns to map to a set of real-valued outputs. Most people will never get a neural network to function well in a data mining context due to over-fitting. My issue with the two specific examples are:<p>1) Image recognition is done in so many different ways, but if you're using neural networks, why not take advantage of the geometry of the layout while simultaneously removing the need for learning about things like hidden node layers. Use HyperNEAT: <a href=""http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/hyperNEATpage/HyperNEAT.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/hyperNEATpage/HyperNEAT.html</a><p>2) Financial data mining is potentially very dangerous. It's easy for people to create models that look very strong in back-testing but are actually just fitting to the relatively limited history of samples. Some people may be foolish enough to think they should take that signal and trade it with their own money-- yikes!<p>A much better introduction to ANNs would be in a reinforcement learning context, where you aren't worried about over-fitting as much.

My hypothesis is that our industry is so entrained to think like this that it's going to take a decade to settle in to our new universe. It's going to be like when the mainframe folks had to come to grips with the PC.<p>We are going to be <i>awash</i> in tablets within a year. Within five years we will be picking them out of the trash.<p>Platforms are a <i>commodity</i> now. I can buy a Windows laptop -- not a netbook, a 15"" laptop -- for a few hundred bucks from my local Micro Center. Netbooks are even cheaper, of course. As for operating systems? The Linux revolution has arrived. Android has arrived and it is open-source. If you want to run your own platform you need to download Android and pay some Chinese manufacturing firm a few hundred bucks per unit to cough out a tablet or a generic smartphone and stick your nameplate on it. And if this isn't true now, it will be true in a year or two.<p>I have a Flip Mino video camera. Its processing power is surely greater than that of the laptop I owned ten years ago. I am about to literally <i>take the thing apart for parts</i> because its resale value is too small to care and my new iPhone is going to be a factor of five more useful.<p>When a hardware platform was a three thousand dollar investment we had to worry a lot about the manufacturer ""dictating what it can be used for"", because we couldn't afford more than one. The one we bought had to support <i>everything</i> we wanted to do, or we would be sad. When hardware platforms cost thirty dollars the calculus will change.<p>What Apple has figured out is that when hardware is a commodity, editing and publishing is the name of the game. You're no longer competing to sell more hardware independent of content, just as Conde Nast is not a paper company. Your asset is taste. Design. The ability to ship hardware-software-content combos that consistently work and consistently make the customer happy.",1276103209

AACE encouraged doctors to consider treatment for patients who test outside the boundaries of a narrower margin based on a target TSH level of 0.3 to 3.04.

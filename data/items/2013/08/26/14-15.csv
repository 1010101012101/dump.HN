6277450,comment,6276296,6276575,7,0,Xylakant,,,"> This is due to political correctness - something that the US seems to have been spared from. So far.<p>The reasons for such a move are mixed. Some part is certainly PC, some other part is that the segregation along &quot;race boundaries&quot; is actually misleading. Income class and eduction is usually a way better boundary when segregating crime statistics. However, for a long list of reasons, africans and arabs (or people moving into the country in general) are over-represented in the poorer classes and underrepresented in the richer class which in turn makes them appear stronger in crime statistics.<p>Another reason is that statistics are often read the wrong way, a problem that occurs very often with the official german crime stats: The most often cited statistic is the &quot;Polizeibericht [1]&quot;, but that lists reported crimes - so everything that ever gets reported to the police. Some of those reports never get prosecuted, some get acquitted at trial, ... The police report in Berlin used to list all reports where the perpetrators nationality was unknown as &quot;foreign&quot;, an error that seriously skewed the stats for any cursory reader. Statistics like that are a very weak datapoint - useful if you know how to read them, useless or even dangerous for most cases where they&#x27;re cited. This misrepresentation of public data leads to a certain caution in publishing stats by the persons in charge.<p>Back to the Topic: I don&#x27;t think that maps of that kind would get you shot, hanged or made outcast in Europe. Quite to the contrary, such maps exist and do provide valuable insight - though the same caveats that apply for the statistics apply here as well. As an example here&#x27;s a map of how many non-germans live in berlin by quarter: <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/7/7d/Bev%C3%B6lkerungskarten_berlin.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/7/7d/Bev%C3%B6lkeru...</a> (top left). It&#x27;s not as fine-grained as the one discussed here, but that&#x27;s probably more due to unavailability of finer data.

6277430,comment,6275479,6277368,1,0,lambda,,,"Note that password hashes are used for more than just password database; they are also used for key derivation functions, for example for deriving a key for encrypting a hard drive or document from a password that someone types in. Any full-disk encryption system needs to use a password based key derivation function for security, and your security if the disk is stolen is solely based on the strength of your password and the strength of your key derivation function (unless you have tamper-proof hardware that is able to store your key and only allows interactive authentication, rather than reading the key out and brute-forcing the password out of it).<p>In fact, encrypting files using a key derivation function was the original use for scrypt, not storing password databased.<p>> In general, strong password encryption is only useful to prevent bad public relations from too many users getting hacked at one time.<p>It&#x27;s also good for lowering the value of cracking your system. If everyone (or a large fraction of developers) does it, it lowers the expected value of breaking into a random system that has low-value accounts. Since people frequently reuse passwords, stealing the password database for a low-value system and cracking them can be used for breaking into higher value systems, as you can try reusing the username or email and password pairs for logging into other systems.",1377529002

Sure, it might become easy from a paperwork standpoint, but supply/demand will kick in and wages will drop.<p>In most countries recruiting immigrants is a royal pain in the ass. The main redeeming factor is that in the case where the immigrant&#x27;s primary motivation is entry into the country (aka a work visa), the recruiter has an excellent negotiating position, especially when the visa in question keeps the immigrant bound to the sponsoring company.<p>Emigrating Americans are a little different, however. We&#x27;re pretty highly paid in comparison to the rest of the world, and we&#x27;re <i>usually</i> quite happy to stay in, or return to, our home country if we can&#x27;t find something that suits us. Couple this with a good education and success in American industry, and this gives us a pretty powerful negotiating position in comparison with other immigrants. We still might not get anything comparable to an American salary, but at least we&#x27;re able to negotiate rather than just having to accept whatever is handed to us.<p>This changes as soon as you remove the safety net. If there isn&#x27;t a huge outflow of Americans, those who are emigrating because they truly want to leave America can just bluff their way through it. If there&#x27;s a huge outflow however, this negotiating position will quickly be lost, at least in the countries to which most Americans would wish to be immigrants.",1377528997

This is thought to be a pretty important mechanism in the formation and maintenance of structures in the body.<p>In case anyone&#x27;s interested, here is a nice (if now rather old, although to be honest scientific writing was so much better back in the &#x27;90s) review on the whole business:<p><a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867400812970"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867400...</a><p>In which we find a paragraph describing this process:<p>&quot;The selector genes do more than specify the pattern and the structures that the compartments will eventually makethey also specify, indirectly, a surface property. This property has been termed cell affinity, meaning that cells that share the same affinity, owing to the same binary code of selector genes, will intermingle during growth. There are a number of different experiments that lead to this conclusion, but perhaps the simplest is the observation that when the selector gene engrailed is removed, in vivo, from a posterior clone of cells in the wing, those cells gain anterior affinity: they now sort out from posterior cells and, if they are in contact with anterior cells, will sort into and mingle with them. Cells from neighboring compartments will have different affinities and tend to minimize their mutual contact, so that where the two compartments abut, there is a relatively straight line across which the cells do not stray.&quot;",1377526919

In the scrypt paper, cperciva recommends parameters that allow it to do a single password hash in 64 ms, and in the process use only 4k of RAM. Nowadays, as processors are faster and ram is cheaper, you&#x27;d probably want to up the parameters a bit, so that the encryption time will be similar (between 50-100 ms) on modern hardware, and the RAM usage will scale proportionally (probably 128k, based on the ratio of RAM prices between 2002 and now). That means that you would be able to handle 10-20 logins per second per core, using no more than 2.5 MB in the process (if they were all run in parallel on separate threads and so all of that memory was needed at once; that&#x27;s obviously a worst case, most likely they would be scheduled more sequentially and use proportionally less RAM as you would free the memory after finishing an encryption). On a 12 core machine, you might wind up using 30 MB at at time, to support 240 logins per second.<p>If you need to handle 240 logins per second (which presumably means many many more requests per second, as there are usually many requests per login), 30 MB of RAM is the least of your worries.<p>Note that these numbers are simply extrapolations from the ones in the original scrypt paper, I haven&#x27;t actually tried this on modern hardware. Regardless, there are parameters that allow you to trade off CPU time and RAM usage, so you can tweak it to provide the level of performance that you require (with the understanding that the faster it is and less RAM it uses, the faster cracking it would be).",1377526779

Not to wait until you&#x27;ve got the language. Because, honestly? - If you&#x27;re not speaking it every day, maintaining reasonable fluency is very difficult. You can&#x27;t get to that sort of skill just putting in a couple of hours here and there in a piecemeal fashion. Even with the best of intentions, how many hours a day do you speak your new language?<p>The same factors that work against you in your own country work for you in another&#x27;s though: It&#x27;s not that hard to learn a new one if your old one is not particularly dominant in your life. When you, by necessity, go from practising a few hours a week to 12-15 hours every day; while being exposed to excellent speakers of the language, while being heavily incentivised to advance (because, hey, if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;ll be lonely and vulnerable) ; you get better at what you&#x27;re doing very quickly.<p>So, I wouldn&#x27;t be too bothered about getting the language particularly nailed down before moving somewhere - provided, of course, you don&#x27;t immediately need to be working or something. If you do, then hiring a tutor and drilling the basics of the language in first is a good idea - you can get vastly superior results that way than by taking classes with others (who may not be as serious about it as you.)",1377526684

The TSA has only cost us $100bn or so, not counting the countless hours and energy lost waiting in line and performing pointless rituals.<p>But more broadly, he&#x27;s a terrorist. As the name suggests, the goal is to create fear. And the TSA is a giant institutionalization of that fear. It&#x27;s only scared people who give up their rights. The TSA is both a response to fear and a creator of fear, and having scared this guy into compliance, they have done their job.",1377526441

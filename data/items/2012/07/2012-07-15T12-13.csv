It is, but never <i>implicitly</i>. Sure, you can get the actual proportions from reading the markings at the bottom, but then what's the point of visualizing in the first place? Either make your logarithmic scaling explicit and clear (as is done in scientific graphs), or use generally assumed linear scaling.<p><pre><code>  > it's not as if Nielson only bumped Nokia, RIM and

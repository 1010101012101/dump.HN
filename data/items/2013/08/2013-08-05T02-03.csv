But I had a guy who knew this cold telling me what to do, he was the one who debugged all our raw compressed data problems bit by bit.  And, yeah, it was an &quot;Intel&quot; little endian TIFF, and I think I recall the Kodak Powescans produced that (600 pound monsters that could scan 18 inches per second at 200 DPI).<p>Hmmm, at least back then, &quot;TIFF&quot; was the selling point, and, oh yeah, it&#x27;s Group IV compressed (except of course when it wasn&#x27;t, we once dealt with some weird enhanced Group III).",1375671464

My first awareness of the NSA was their Echelon spying efforts, where it was openly discussed that they wanted to vacuum up all the worlds&#x27; communications. The weakness of the DES cipher was widely recognized to be a  NSA plot to make it easy to intercept domestic comms. The Clipper chip and key escrow programs were a naked domestic snooping plan. This was widely covered by the trade press, a fair bit by the mainstream media, exhaustively by Slashdot and Ars Technica, and obsessively by the Computer Underground Digest, the Hacker News Network, the Cipherpunks, Telecom Digest, and many others.<p>Hacker News has also started importing the Reddit Censorship ethos.

6158016,comment,6157485,6157485,6,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Slashdot was never very good. One big reason for that was that it actively courted &quot;humorous&quot; comments. This was a huge monkey wrench in their moderation scheme, it meant that even if moderation made it possible to cut out the lowest end of the comment quality spectrum it still did very little to elevate the other end. More so, the system didn&#x27;t discourage spam and trolling it just made it easier to hide, so any comments on the site were always swimming in an enormous sea of mostly hidden crap, which made it difficult for later comments to be noticed and moderated up. The moderation system in general did a very poor job at fostering good discussion. At best you could hope for a few decent one off comments. Another problem that slashdot has always had was a very strong leaning toward a mob mentality and exclusion of contrarian viewpoints. If slashdot talked about Microsoft, for example, it was a flurry of Microsoft bashing, not a discussion.<p>HN, for all its faults, does a much better job fostering high quality discussion. And probably promoting interesting submissions as well, although I think the system is much more flawed in that regard.<p>Anyway, I think that a good chunk of &quot;political&quot; stories that have become popular on HN lately do belong here. Surveillance and freedom and how they pertain to the online world are big, fundamental issues of serious historical importance that we need to grapple with today. To remove those from our view because today it tends to be difficult to have a high quality discussion about a political topic is, I think, a mistake.<p>I think the issue is not one of whether or not HN should abandon talking about political subjects I think the issue is making sure that HN concerns itself with subjects that are legitimately important and conducts discussions that are mature, well-reasoned, and intellectually stimulating. And I think those things are well within the grasp of the HN community.",1375668144

It&#x27;s just not regurgitation of existing bits of information that have already been posted hundreds of times.  We burn out on the repetition and get annoyed.<p>What <i>is</i> relevant, and in my eyes disappointing, is that there has been little <i>deep</i> discourse on the topic.  Every article starts at the basic &quot;OMFG&quot; and doesn&#x27;t take a broader view of new developments.<p>There is some incentive that is driving the decline of quality content and interaction on the site.  Whether it is attention, karma, or whatever, site members have responded with a focus on shallow quantity.<p>For example, there hasn&#x27;t been a deep discussion on why privacy is a right.  There&#x27;ve been a few comments, such as Schneier&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s your salary?&quot; that evoke the fear of having privacy violated, but people who are afraid of negative stimulus will override their fear for a more meaningful or important goal.  Why is what the NSA doing bad, from basic philosophical principles, and what will the impact be on business, technology, and society in the coming years?<p>Solving the problem is not simple or trivial, but I&#x27;m sure Paul has given many approaches significant thought.  It&#x27;s difficult to implement them without changing the essential simplicity of the site.<p>There is the Reddit path of subreddits and the various &quot;this thread moved to IYFCategory&quot; forums.  I&#x27;m not sure that helps.  However, there is a natural clustering of some of these topics.  While a &quot;politics&quot; cluster is too broad, some shorter-lived and more specialized clusters, such as Snowden/Angular/whatever grouping, would afford discussion among those interested, encapsulate the babble storm, yet give an indication of activity so that individuals can determine their own level of involvement.  &quot;I see you&#x27;re posting a link to a story about Edward Snowden.  I&#x27;m adding it to the Snowdenball.&quot;<p>Another approach is to limit karma.  The people who post karma-bait will top out very quickly and either lose interest, or focus less on the score they have accumulated.  It could just be another exponential function of up votes.  1:1 when getting started, then decrease the karma adjustment of each vote over time.  Then one has positive and negative feedback, especially among &quot;newer&quot; accounts, and less of a desire even to look at the number past 2,000 or some arbitrary figure.<p>It&#x27;s a tough problem.

Then I used colorRampPalette() to generate a \ncolor palette from black to blue to white, and colored the lines according to order they were drawn.'<p>If I am understanding this correctly (I'm probably not), longer lines would never be as bright as short lines. Why? Let's say hypothetically, that all Bostonians had at least 10 friends in Madrid, then wouldn't we want to see that as a white line on the chart? Please correct me if I am wrong.",1292767767

Public WiFi is just more popular and easier target.<p>Just don't think your colleague (who hates you) or nearest BOFH at the job, technically can't stealthly plug out your cable while you're out, hook up his router performing a MitM attack, and have his fun and profit. Yeah, that's childish, much less probable, and incomparably more risky than just sitting with laptop at cafe, but the point is that every one of said attacks can still be carried out.<p>Just because the whole world's relying on the obscurity as a primary security measure.",1292767627

2021683,comment,2016136,2021452,0,0,jules,,,"Comparing the total deaths caused by two different activities is nonsensical. A comparison that makes sense is deaths caused per minute of the activity.<p>Whether cycling is safe depends on whether you live in a cyclist friendly or cyclist hostile country. It is also known that the health benefits of cycling outweigh the risks in expected life span: <a href=""http://ehp03.niehs.nih.gov/article/info:doi/10.1289/ehp.0901747"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ehp03.niehs.nih.gov/article/info:doi/10.1289/ehp.0901...</a><p>In the Netherlands there are about 1.6 deaths per 100 million kilometers cycled (that number in the US is about 10x as large). If we generously assume an average velocity of 20 km/h, that's 3*10^6 hours of cycling giving on average 1 death. The human life span is about 10^6 hours. So even if you cycled day and night for your entire life, the probability of dying in a cycling accident would be about 30%. And note that only tourists wear helmets in the Netherlands, wearing a helmet is not worth the additional safety.<p>But really the important point is that when you're cycling you are taking the risk. Cyclists cause much fewer other deaths per km than drivers. When you let your pitbull play with a kid, other people are taking the risk.<p>> I expect people here to be open towards other people pointing out their different POV<p>I am open to other people's point of view, but when I find out that all the evidence is completely contrary to their point of view, like that pitbulls are not more dangerous than other dogs, then I decide that perhaps their POV is wrong. Note that I'm not saying that dogs are dangerous. I'm just saying that pitbulls are more dangerous than other dogs.",1292767563

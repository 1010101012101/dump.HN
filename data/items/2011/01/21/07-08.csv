2126796,comment,2126751,2126751,0,0,Swizec,,,"Well I think there are actually two questions in your question. First you're talking about learning, then you're talking about studying for exams.<p>For me those two are distinctly different concepts.<p>As far as learning goes, I usually take the route of reading a lot about a subject, dabbling with it, trying to find a pet project to do in the field. Usually just going through a bunch of wikipedia stuff and trying to mingle with the people more knowledgable than me. This process can take months, sometimes years or decades. But it is <i>very</i> effective and it plays to my eternal learning and slight polymathic side.<p>Then there is studying for exams. That is a short term process (and the knowledge is a lot more superficial and short term ish). This involves a lot of quick reading[1], cramming as much wikipedia in my head and doing as much practice as I can to get a good enough grasp on the subject to pass. This usually takes a few days, a few tens of hours that is. Depending on how difficult I find the exam/subject.<p>[1]my method of quick reading is a very simple subvocal technique, I can only do about two pages a minute. Not something fierce like some people can. It also involves first going through the book just reading the titles, then just reading the first paragraph under every title, then the first page under every title. Then the whole book (twice-ish). This structurally builds up the data in my head well enough that I can then at least sort of know what I'm looking at when taking the exam.<p>And now some anecdotal evidence that my way of studying for exams works: Last year I passed 8 exams (more than in the two years prior to that), while also doing a startup full-time and part-time freelancing.",1295596787

This is the first or second real programming gig for most of the engineers; product side is a little more experienced, but not by much. One thing that we consistently run into is poor scheduling estimates-- something takes just a little bit longer than expected, and this has a cascading domino effect that far exceeds the initial misstep. We've tried to apply the old adages-- take your best estimate and double it, remember that the last 20% of a task takes 50% of the time-- but things still seem to unravel with each sprint.<p>It seems like estimating time is one of the less talked-about skills of the engineer, but one that's at least as important as cranking out good code, and maybe harder to master. So for the more seasoned engineers out there, or anyone, really: how did you learn to look at a project, break it down, and attach time to the pieces? I find our team struggling with 2-week sprints, but there are clearly people planning things out months in advance-- what steps do you take? What about making or validating estimates on aspects that you don't have expertise in (for instance, estimating a front-end task when you're mostly on the backend)? When starting with no history, how many weeks of concrete scheduling data do you need before your estimates begin to hold water? And on the softer side, how do you (gently) nudge someone in the right direction if they are consistently off in their estimates?<p>Lastly, a couple ideas I've heard of but never tried:<p>- Planning poker: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker<p>- Use fib when assigning hrs to tasks: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13h etc<p>Anyone use these with success?

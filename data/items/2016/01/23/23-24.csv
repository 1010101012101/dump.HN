10960729,comment,10947712,10958655,0,0,hackuser,,,"> Now, among the wealthy and powerful you also get types like the Koch brothers, who use their power for dubious ends - that&#x27;s inevitable in a capitalist system.<p>It&#x27;s not. Don&#x27;t accept the status quo as inevitable. Money wasn&#x27;t always so enormously concentrated in a few hands, and the disparity wasn&#x27;t always so great. It&#x27;s worse now in the U.S. than in modern history, and worse than on other Western nations. It&#x27;s now in an extreme state.<p>The current rules of the economy, the tax rates, etc. that yield this situation are not inevitable or somehow natural. They aren&#x27;t the result of capitalism or the free market. They are simply the product of politics that favor one group (a group that now has enormous power over government) over others.<p>> There&#x27;s no way to prevent that aside from very strict socialism<p>I disagree. They can have their money, and we can separate money from politics. If we take money out of elections then money loses a great amount of influence. If we decide and fund public issues democratically, as our nation fundementally believes, everyone gets a vote in deciding things for their community. For example, I was reading that because government is so under-funded a park in a New York was being funded by someone wealthy. Now who decides where that park should go and what it should look like? Instead of being decided democratically by everyone in the community, it&#x27;s dictated by the oligarch. That&#x27;s not democracy.<p>> Democracy is not some magic solution. It&#x27;s often described as the best of a lot of bad options.<p>I agree, but it&#x27;s clearly the most effective; almost all the nations that lead in their citizen&#x27;s welfare, from health to education to safety to civil rights to economic issues, are democracies. Also, there is very importat moral component - nobody has a right to tell me what to do, and if we have to come to an agreemet, we should vote on it with everyone getting an equal say.<p>>  if you look at democracies in the third-world and developing world where your average person is uneducated - doesn&#x27;t lead to good results.<p>I disagree that the results are necessarily worse than they would be under other forms of government. Also, we&#x27;re talking about the United States and not a developing country.<p>> The best form of government has often been described as a benevolent dictatorship.<p>Hmmm ... I haven&#x27;t heard that from anyone but the dictators who want people to think they are benevolent. If they are so effective and benevolent, why not hold an election? No doubt everyone will vote for them.<p>> I see no problem with people like Bill Gates having amassed power, money, and influence, because he can use it far more effectively than a mob of your average citizens would - the average citizen being a lot less educated and less intelligent than Bill Gates.<p>Let&#x27;s assume Gates is more intelligent than the average (almost certainly true) and is purely benevolent (certainly not true, and remember the corrupting influence of power). He still can&#x27;t do better because he can&#x27;t possibly understand the interests and needs of millions of people; nobody has that capacity. That, along with the lack of true benevolence, is one place where central planning fails and where free markets and democracy succeed. The people who don&#x27;t have a seat at the table are the ones who get their interests trampled on because either nobody cares, or people think of course, the other person&#x27;s priorities really aren&#x27;t as important as their own.",1453593355

If you want to add &quot;warmth&quot; or &quot;color&quot; or whatever to the sound, it&#x27;s better to quantify what that means, then purposefully distort the audio in a dedicated device (or in software).<p>Think about what life would be like if displays were built and reviewed like audio tech. Imagine companies like NuForce and Schiit sold screens that didn&#x27;t accurately reproduce colors. Owners of these displays would praise them for their &quot;warmth&quot; or talk about how much green colors &quot;pop&quot; or whatever. It would be absurd.<p>We can actually measure contrast ratio, color accuracy, viewing angles, etc. That&#x27;s how we evaluate displays.

Indirect light from bulb, or having a device blast light directly into your retina. Never stood a chance. Just shifting the colors can only reduce so much light.

Or perhaps not if we don&#x27;t get our act together here and now. Evidently we need to have children in order to have the chance of incrementally defeating aging by building ever better versions of a biological repair kit to reverse ever more of the damage that causes degeneration and death. This task is one of decades, long enough that it may be today&#x27;s researchers who start the job, but it&#x27;ll be younger hands that finish it - their children and grandchildren. Yet creating people is somewhat like drafting them into a war and a human condition that they didn&#x27;t ask for:<p>&quot;There&#x27;s a task we need you for, son, you and the rest of your generation. We may or may not manage to complete it, but we certainly won&#x27;t without your help - and if we don&#x27;t get this done, we&#x27;re dead all too soon, a slow death, heavy on the pain and suffering. We&#x27;ll be dragged away first so you get to see the end in all its horror, with plenty of sleepless nights to think it over before it happens to you as well. Oh yes, and most people don&#x27;t see the need for any of this work and think the pain and suffering and death is just dandy. So that&#x27;s the deal, a raw one all round - welcome to the asylum, son. No need to thank me.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m sympathetic to the hedonistic imperative view of pain and priorities in technological development, and I also think there&#x27;s a fair but short-sighted argument to be made for nihilism along the lines of voluntary species extinction. It runs something along the lines of a utilitarian consideration of suffering, slavery, existence, natural rights, and similar concerns. I call that short-sighted because, if we&#x27;re going to be utilitarian, we should consider that the point and beneficiary of all this technological development - not to mention the bone mountain of suffering and corpses we stand upon and continue to build - is very much not us. Our own longevity and diminished future suffering is a tiny side-effect on the way to providing massively greater benefits to our future descendants, be they biological or machine intelligences. They will be so greatly endowed by the cumulative efforts in advancing technology that ensuring their existence (and ensuring that it comes about as soon as possible) will far and away outweigh our needs in any utilitarian consideration. We are short-lived, small in number, small in mind, and planet-bound evolved intelligences, while our descendants of future centuries will not be any of those things. There will be trillions of them, a near infinite variety of forms of mind, ageless, absent suffering, and hopefully wiser than us for it. They will exist because we, our forebears, and our children suffered the limitations and risks of our present existence in order to build the road that little bit further - and because we chose to inflict the same on others by bringing them into being.<p>So having children still looks to me largely like throwing new people into a horrible situation in order that some of them will try make it better - and with some hope that they might benefit as individuals, but also the considerable risk that they will not, and suffer greatly as a consequence. Beyond that, there is an abstract grail that will be enjoyed by people yet to come - our descendants made in biology or machinery - who we will likely never know, and whose era will be brilliant and golden beyond our imagining, but only if we strive to lay the foundation stones here and now.",1453591876

Wind energy also has its own state-level political clout and lobbying, because large landowners in West Texas see it as a way of improving monetization of their large holdings of ranchland, and large West Texas landowners are a well-organized interest group.

10960622,comment,10957315,10957315,0,0,tansey,,,"It seems like most of these complaints center around the idea of the inherent subjectivity of the prior. In cases like astronomy and other hard sciences, the prior reflects actual scientific knowledge and is not really subjective at all. In cases where we don&#x27;t have that kind of evidence, empirical Bayes methods work very well by just peaking at some subset of the data and finding a good point estimate for the prior.<p>I&#x27;m also not sure why the OP thinks that calculating the normalizing constant is a huge issue. Most of the time you rarely need it since you&#x27;re likely going to end up doing an MCMC or some other sampling method for the posterior, in which case you only need proportionality.<p>There are lots of problems with Bayesian methods in practice, but most of them revolve around the scalability of modern methods to massive data sets and very complicated models. Many Bayesians tend to think that it&#x27;s absolutely crucial to quantify uncertainty and that the added computational cost and human effort is worthwhile. In practice, point estimate methods to find MAP or even just maximum likelihood values work really well for most problems. If you look at the trend in most machine learning, for instance, generally people find a cool way to solve some problem with good performance (e.g. SGD + Deep Nets), then some Bayesian lab spends a few years trying to interpret everything as a generative model and coming up with a clever way to sample everything (e.g. Lawernce Carin&#x27;s lab at Duke has done a lot of this work in Deep Bayesian Nets). The end result is usually better, but by then most people have moved on to a newer problem and the appeal of getting a marginal boost in performance is harder for me to see. The Bayesian nonparametrics crowd has historically done a pretty good job of hitting a sweet spot of compromise on this by keeping a Bayesian view but still (usually) treating everything as an optimization problem first (e.g. variational inference methods).",1453591616

But yes,   the only affect it should have is to possibly value loop variables low enough to spill them instead of non loop variables (note that non loop variables are calculated using both exit and entry frequencies)  That is almost certainly a bad idea in general, execution frequencies are what you should use whether in loops or not.    It most likely the real issue is a bunch of loops are having their relative (to non loop blocks) execution frequencies over estimated highly, and in reality the loop doesn&#x27;t execute much",1453590113

There is some overhead to spawning a thread, and so processing 16 fragments at a time is typically faster even though the shader itself is doing more work.<p>The driver provides both versions because it&#x27;s the GPU that decides which version is use and where, even using both versions to shade the same primitive. For instance, on a triangle boundary maybe only 4 or 8 fragments are &quot;lit&quot;, so the hardware spawns a SIMD8 thread and saves itself a little work.<p>SIMD16 shaders typically use twice the number of registers as SIMD8, and if they require registers to be spilled to memory it&#x27;s likely the SIMD8 shader is faster even with the additional thread-spawning overhead. Lots of compiler optimization revolves around trying to squeak in under the register limit to get the program compiled as SIMD16 without spilling. :)",1453590031

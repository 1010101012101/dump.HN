It often takes heroic efforts to put together a working version of the algorithms described, sometimes so much work that nobody has ever done it (Chazelle has some algorithms that have never been implemented in code).  Even if it's plausible to do, don't be surprised if it takes weeks to get it working right.  The more ""on the edge"" the algorithms are, the more difficult it tends to be, and it's not really likely that you'll be able to quickly experiment with new methods unless the authors have published code.<p>This happens far less often than it should, because simple possession of a working algorithm is often enough to squeeze several more papers out of a topic, so authors have no particular incentive to share theirs, or even make it easy to create one from scratch.  Computer graphics papers are particularly bad on that front, often omitting so much detail that even with significant study and effort you could never reproduce their results without researching the problem on your own anyways.<p>Other people have offered good advice: go through it in excruciating detail, think about every equation as its own sub-problem, and make sure you understand what's happening at each step.  These papers are meant for detailed study, not quick reading, even if the reader already knows a lot about the field.  Google should help you through most of the math stuff, and try going to book search or the papers search if you're not finding anything online, which will give you good keywords to look for books on.",1257353912

921987,comment,921817,921817,0,0,rufo,,,"The call quality on the iPhone seems much better than on previous smartphones I've used (almost exclusively Treos), and callers complain about my voice quality far less then they used to. I can't compare to Blackberries since I haven't owned any. I'm willing to believe that Palm's handset design was poor, although I did own every Sprint model that came out for several years (300, 600, 650, 700) and you'd think they'd have fixed it if call quality was that bad.<p>My understanding is that 3G (UMTS/HSDPA) and EDGE/GSM are two different networks running in parallel. If the 3G network is overloaded with iPhones, then older/cheaper phones that only use 2.5G should (in my understanding) work better. This theory could be tested if iPhone owners tried disabling 3G, but I don't know if that's a widely-tested theory.<p>I don't know if the overloaded 3G network is the entire problem with the iPhone - maybe it's combined with a poor ability to handle an overcrowded network. I can say that I live in Western NY (Rochester) and do not see any of the problems people/articles report. I drop calls <i>maybe</i> once every two weeks, I've only missed calls due to reception problems and have never had problems with missing/failed text messages. (I have had some occasional Visual Voicemail issues, however.)<p>I have, however, had all those problems when going to conferences in much larger cities, and those conferences have had very high proportions of iPhone users.<p>It's a tricky problem, because Apple chooses their partner carriers and their reputation is coupled to the carrier's experience. Apple wants to sell as many phones as possible, but that seems to quickly overload the carrier network in many areas and leaves an impression of the device not working well. I wonder if this would be less of a problem if Apple chose to only sell unlocked phones and not partner with carriers, but then the iPhone wouldn't be the success it is today.",1257353048

To make money on each and every one of those movements screams ""exploited loophole"", if that's actually what happened.  I'll leave it to other interested parties to calculate the probability of that happening by chance; it depends on your assumptions, but there's no way that it's significant enough to consider.<p>Or maybe they've fully solved the problem of market timing.  But they're really just not that smart (there's not an analyst alive that believes you can nail day to day movements at 99% accuracy).<p>In this field, another maxim applies: never attribute to genius that which can be adequately explained by malice.  Here, we've got motive and opportunity for malice, so I'm very hesitant to believe that they're playing fair...<p>However, I also don't necessarily believe that these numbers mean what we think they mean, since I don't know how they were generated, or what sorts of accounting or trading tricks may have been played to ""smooth out"" the risk profile and ensure very few losing days, as long as the long term average was positive.  The appearance of zero-risk trading has some very tangible benefits, and there's a lot of stuff you can do to shift a distribution of returns so that it looks a lot less volatile than it really is...that whole CDS bonanza had a lot to do with shifting risk to the tails to snatch at predictable returns the rest of the time, so who am I to say there's not something similar going on here?",1257352976

Moving complex stuff away from the kernel is a win pretty much always when there are no pressing performance reasons to do otherwise. This code will only run once every time a program is started, so performance is certainly not a good reason to put it in kernel.<p>What I really want to reiterate here is that using fat_elf:s would in <i>absolutely no way</i> make shipping stuff to multiple different linux platforms easier. The reason it is hard is because when someone says linux, pretty much the only guarantee you have about the system is that it runs a linux kernel, and even that can potentially be so old or be so strange that you can't trust anything about it. All fat_elf gives us is stuffing multiple binaries in a single file, and we can do this already without much fuss. It does not in any way give us true ""Universal Binaries"", because to do so, we would have to either agree on a common subset of libraries a linux system should always ship (and agree on indefinite binary compability for those libraries), or ship a meaningful portion of the entire platform in every binary.<p>If you want what fat_elf gives, you can get it with a 20-line shell script you concatenate into a bunch of binaries, and it could be argued that it is the <i>cleaner</i> and better place to put it in, considering it's only an ugly hack anyway.

I think everyone knows this.  In addition to re-packaging your model to answer more relevant questions as Jason suggests why not also have a conversation on your assumptions/inputs, defending them with the logic used and comparable examples.<p>I don't have vast experience pitching to angels, but I've helped large enterprises size markets for new products and offerings.  I've found that having a good conversation on your inputs helps tremendously in getting past that initial ""smell test.""  Most of the time, people just need to hear the reasoning behind using such and such multiplier, growth rate, etc.<p>Yes its all crap.  But thats the nature with any model.  Showing that your crap smells less than others may be a good starting point to consider.",1257350662

However The Edge is what I call an Inner Circle site. Outsiders get to spectate, but there is no way for outsiders to ask questions or raise objections. The Edge seems introverted to the point of sterility. My dream for Outer Circle is that it should impose a wholesome discipline on outsiders. They are not confined to spectating but can ask questions and raise objection. On the other hand outsiders have to work for access, playing nicely, and earning a place on insider's white lists.<p>The big win happens when you have people you don't know making unexpected positive contributions. The hard question is how to permit that without suffering the usual forum problem.",1257350442

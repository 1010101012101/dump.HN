252107,comment,251853,251950,0,0,rantfoil,,,"I would echo these sentiments. Sachin and I worked on Posterous.com remotely (I was in Mountain View and he was in NYC) for the months before we applied and were accepted to YC Summer 2008. We could work independently for long stretches and get large pieces of functionality done fast just over IM.<p>In fact, we've found this summer in Cambridge that the times we've been really able to crank out code are the weekends when one of us is traveling and one of us hangs back at the ranch. Complete control over distractions = gigantic productivity boost.",1216632047

252100,comment,249956,250103,0,0,demallien,,,"Yes and no.  Perhaps more accurately you should say 'Anyone who relies on restricting information <i>indefinately</i> to stay in business is in trouble these days.'<p>There are many cases where restricting information <i>for a limited duration</i> is an entirely viable business proposition.  A classic example is Pay TV.  In Europe, Pay TV operators make an absolute truckload of money each time the Football World Cup rolls around.  Why?  Just before the tournament starts, they all update the algorithms protecting their broadcasts.  In general, these algorithms are pretty thoroughly hacked, and you can relatively easily get your hands on a pirated STB to get your feed.  But it takes a while to figure these hacks out (anywhere between 1 month and several years, depending on how clever the scheme is).  The thing is, it's no good figuring out how to crack the system in 3 months time, the pirate's customer wants to watch the football live!  So, he has no choice but to cough up the money for the official STB/Pay TV subscription.",1216631124

It is infeasible to check them by hand, so I'll never learn about any false positives. In other words, email is not a reliable way to reach me anymore :-(",1216630808

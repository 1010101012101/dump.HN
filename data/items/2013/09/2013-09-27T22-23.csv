Don&#x27;t BS about technical answers. If you don&#x27;t know the answer to something, that is OK. A good interviewer would rather you walk them through the steps you would take to find the answer than completely make one up. Big no-no.<p>3. I don&#x27;t know what position you are applying for but you should be expected to know some basics about attack vectors, defenses, security strategies, and general computing. Brush up on your scripting skills while you are at it. Python is my language of choice. Bash scripting is also highly desired.<p>4. Don&#x27;t regurgitate a list of tools you know.

6460041,comment,6458360,6459009,20,0,tikhonj,,,"Yes, there are differences. Fundamentally, the Haskell type system is not just about correctness: it actually makes the language more expressive! You simply wouldn&#x27;t be able to do some very awesome typeclass things with a system like this, for example. I&#x27;ve found things like QuickCheck--or even just using different monads--to be much more awkward without typeclasses.<p>The way this works is by allowing you to overload a function on its <i>return</i> type. It&#x27;s very easy to imagine a function overloaded on its argument; for example, a hypothetical:<p><pre><code>    to_string :: a -> String
</code></pre>
This function can take an argument of some sort and returns its string representation. Many languages support this sort of overloading--it&#x27;s very straightforward. But what about the symmetric from_string function?<p><pre><code>    from_string :: String -> a
</code></pre>
Now this is trickier! Most languages would force you to be more explicit about which function you&#x27;re using, so you would have to write something like Double.from_string or Integer.from_string and so on. This loses the symmetry inherent in the types and forces you to add a whole bunch of redundant noise to your code. Very reminiscent of Java&#x27;s Foo i = new Foo()!<p>With typeclasses, you can actually write a from_string function like this. Moreover, it works using exactly the same type inference system you already know and love! In practice, this means that the overloading is very straighforward: it just chooses whatever type you need. And since the type system is pervasive, you know that it will always choose the right instance if possible: if you use from_string expecting an int, it can&#x27;t accidentally use Float.from_string because that wouldn&#x27;t even typecheck.<p>This turns out to be useful in a whole bunch of different places. One of my favorites is with numeric literals: in Haskell, numeric literals are polymorphic. This means that if you write f 10, 10 will be the right type--integer, double, arbitrary precision integer, whatever--for the function. No more arbitrary sigils after your numbers (like 10L). More importantly, this makes new numeric types feel just like native ones[1]. So you can use normal literals with rational numbers or constructive real numbers or 8-bit words or symbolic bitvectors (most of which I&#x27;ve used in real code). These types no longer feel like second-class citizens!<p>Haskell type inference is even more useful than that though. Not only does it reduce the burden of using the type system, it also actually enables new workflows. Instead of giving the compiler your types and waiting for it to show you where they&#x27;re wrong, you can actually just ask the compiler what type it <i>expects</i>. You can use this to interactively grow your program, informed by your types. The newest version of GHC will make this more convenient by adding a feature called &quot;type holes&quot;, which lets you leave holes in your code and will tell you the types of those holes. Once this gets good editor support, it&#x27;ll be incredible.<p>The Haskell type system--partly because it&#x27;s pervasive and partly because it controls effects--also makes some high-level optimizations like steam fusion possible. The basic idea is that it can rewrite multiple logical traversals over an array into a single tight loop. The crazy thing is that this optimization is actually specified by a library, and not built into the compiler! So there are actually a whole bunch of rewrite optimizations like this, most of which are only guaranteed to be correct thanks to the type system. Since they&#x27;re somewhat tricky to debug even with all the existing guarantees, I don&#x27;t even want to imagine what it would be like with a weaker type system.<p>Honestly, I think you would be missing out on most of the real advantages Haskell gives you. And for what? At least in my experience, you do not get much of a boost in productivity or expressiveness. Even without invoking the optional type system.<p>So yeah: lots of deeper tradeoffs.<p>[1]: Take a look at &quot;Growing a Language&quot;, a brilliant talk by Guy Steele that goes into why it&#x27;s important to allow new additions to feel just like native parts of a language.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0</a>",1380322170

Cigars are impractical as addictive agents, because they&#x27;re very expensive and take a long time to consume. But they exhibit at least <i>some</i> mildly to moderately addictive properties. Back in grad school I found myself moving up the ladder from the occasional cigar a week, to the cigar every day, to the two to three cigars a day.

In general, I have been pretty rough on Scala, but the long and short of it is something like this: Scala trades being a usable FP language for being good at Java interop.  Everything you could want to do in Java (except for enums) is possible and usually significantly easier and more succinct in Scala.  Everything you would want to do in OCaml, Haskell, or Scheme, is possible and usually extraordinarily difficult in Scala.<p>> -- Scala advocates a completely different style of programming. You have to rethink how you code to match Scala&#x27;s functional style. This is not a trivial thing if you have a bunch of Java developers you need to convert.<p>Imperative Scala is both performant and readable.  For the application I work on, in many places it is the only style that is sufficiently performant.<p>> -- I find the Scala documentation is less readable than Java&#x27;s docs. They are cluttered with type conversion functions and unreadable operator overloads (the filtering helps a bit here, but it&#x27;s extra work). Documentation is also split between the object/class/trait pages.<p>This is pretty much true.  Good IDE support and #scala@freenode help.<p>> -- There&#x27;s a whole class of immutable data structures whose performance characteristics I need to learn, since I&#x27;m supposed to be using them.<p>You can use whatever data structures you want, including the ones in java.util.  If immutable data structures are appropriate for your application (for instance, because you want nondeterminism based on Scala&#x27;s delimited continuations, and repeated invocations of the same continuation should of course see the same data, or because you want to pass a lasting view of the current state of your collection to another thread), then you can use them.<p>> -- I&#x27;m not convinced that the overhead of copying immutable data doesn&#x27;t outweigh the benefits of the ability to trivially parallelize the code.<p>This is an objection to a particular way of structuring applications, rather than to a language.<p>> -- I&#x27;m not convinced that a project preferring only immutable data is easier to maintain.<p>This is also not a Scala thing.  My insignificant industry experience indicates that it is true.  More importantly, John Carmack seems to think so: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6278047"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6278047</a><p>> -- Programs seem to take longer to compile (sbt is especially slow).<p>Yeah.  I would be okay with this if I got the GLORIOUS TYPE SAFETY from it, but Scala does not really deliver on this front.<p>> then you need to know all of Scala&#x27;s features as well.<p>This is a big burden, to be sure, and Scala introduces some unreasonable gotcha&#x27;s along the way.

If you need your code to be generic, you can use macros etc to fill in that slot at compile time.<p>Dynamically: OOP Techniques<p>See &quot;Existential Types&quot;. As long as your coding to interfaces instead of concrete types, you can create proxy objects who can perform dynamic dispatch. What is a search problem at compile time is often a key lookup at runtime. This is what happens behind the scenes with generic monad code in GHC and friends anyway: They reify a dictionary of methods and thread that through.",1380320874

What that does is grab all of the integers from 0 to 1,000,000, convert them to an immutable List, then filter that List (yes-- an iterator! with a filtered copy!) by only taking numbers divisible by 100. The whole thing takes a couple hundred ms in the repl (which is fantastic, since it&#x27;s <i>compiling then executing the code</i>) and almost no memory overhead.

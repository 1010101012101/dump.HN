So the problem is that you  can some things really easily (e.g. netflix or sharing from phone) but you miss some other that somebody is looking for (e.g. use it a good mediaplayer having quite an old pc and phone that can&#x27;t be used for transcoding sources).<p>I&#x27;ve found some of these here[1] but owning no chromecast I can&#x27;t do any test by myself.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/comments/1umk7t/lets_make_this_the_last_how_do_i_play_local/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/comments/1umk7t/lets_make...</a>",1408859499

With a socialised medical system, you don&#x27;t pay upfront for your medical treatment. It&#x27;s paid for from taxes from the whole population - and if your income is low enough, you may consume more resources than you provide towards the system - in which case you are getting something for nothing! The combination of these factors - obfuscation of payment, and disconnection of amount paid/good received - create the perverse incentives causing economic decline seen in the countries pursuing these policies.<p>And the argument about socialised services being more efficient definitely needs a citation.",1408859387

With this you only need to learn functional patterns (major, minor, etc.) and suddenly you know them for all keys. Other layouts have been attempted (see the janko layout), but they never caught on. I wonder if the mobility of accordions is one reason they&#x27;ve been able to have more variation.<p>How does the ableton push solve this problem?

8217818,comment,8212340,8217246,1,0,wdewind,,,"> Sorry, my point is more that the study would be basically the same anyway.<p>I disagree, the study would be completely different.  This study is studying the acute effects of diet on the body, specifically trying to determine if macronutrient composition has an effect on weight loss, given equal calories.<p>The study I&#x27;m talking about would deal with long term behavioral aspects of dieting, and would look for people who had long term success with dieting and see what they are eating.  Or maybe there would be some other study design, but it certainly wouldn&#x27;t be like the one they are doing now, which completely controls diet thus eliminating the compliance aspect.<p>The reason I think this distinction is so important is because of the amount of energy being consumed by the scientific community around debating the question of whether or not macronutrient composition has a direct effect on weight loss.  Even if the people who feel like macronutrient composition has a direct impact on weight loss are right, the effect is not very dramatic.<p>It would be much more fruitful to study the psychological impact of specific diets, and whether or not they are likely to impact over eating, which is the one and only cause of obesity, as you mentioned.",1408858937

In other words, whether it would have been practically possible to selectively legalize high-end sex work.",1408857608
8217781,comment,8217565,8217565,10,0,lispm,,,"> When Germany legalised prostitution in 2002 it triggered an apparently unstoppable growth in the country’s sex industry.<p>One needs to be careful when making judgements about what the causes were for this growth.<p>One need to keep in mind that Germany has several strong driving forces for change in our society and around us.<p>* economic collapse in former east europe<p>* change in political and economic systems<p>* open borders<p>* a lot of poor and desperate people in Germany and in neighbor countries.<p>* Many european countries further in the east are even worse in most ways: no jobs, no perspective, corruption, very little recovery, ...<p>* Germany had an economic recovery during the last decade and has been able to control the effects of the world-wide financial crisis on its economy.<p>* the Euro in Germany and west Europe remained stable. In those troubled country in the east, there is no Euro. Some smaller countries now joined the Eurozone.<p>We had the reunification of east and west germany. 20 million people had a drastic change in life, with their economy collapsing, authorities gone, the political system changed, jobs gone, ... Some recovery happened in the last decade, but that was very tough for many people and dampened by a lot of money from mostly western parts of Germany. All borders to neighbor countries are now wide open. All the east european countries went through even harder economic times. The financial crisis made it even worse. High unemployment in neighbor countries, especially for young people, while unemployment in Germany was going down. Many people moved to west europe for work. Legal or not. Eastern neighbors all joined the EU, which for example now means that people can move freely and work freely in other countries.<p>Thus it&#x27;s not easy to compare it with other countries and it is not possible to think about prostitution independent from the other developments. The number of people in prostition is not just depending on the type of law. Germany has rich West Germany and an added East Germany. At its border it has countries with a lot of poor people, formely all communist. This difference in wealth, job opportunities, etc. creates enough opportunities which can be exploited. Thus we would have seen a lot increase in the sex business, whether we would have legalized it or not. Trying to control that with police and laws would have been very very difficult. There are open borders to all sides. Thinking that young women from eastern Europe would not been here, if laws were tougher is naive. We didn&#x27;t open the borders to create new ones.<p>I think it was a smart move to prevent people from going underground. Still it makes sense to look if changes to the laws etc. are necessary after more than a decade.",1408857558

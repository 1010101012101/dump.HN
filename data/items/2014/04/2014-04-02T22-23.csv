Those formats I mentioned might have been developed by groups, but they were groups made up of companies with expertise, right?</i><p>Yeah, but that still happens. There&#x27;s the W3C and the WHATWG, of course, but also formats like Opus (Xiph.Org, Skype, Mozilla and others) and protocols like OData.<p><i>At least in the OpenDocument days you had Sun as the corporate owners. (...) Why does DropBox not feel some responsibility to step in here, as the industry leader? This is a company that was launched on HackerNews. You are like us, why does this not bother you?</i><p>I think you&#x27;re being a little unfair to Dropbox here. You should remember that Sun was in a very different situation: they weren&#x27;t market leaders, they were users and the main vendor (MS) was asking them so much to license Office, that it was cheaper to flat-out buy StarOffice. And then opening it up was certainly socially beneficial, but it was also a way of pulling some power from Microsoft&#x27;s hands and making it easier for Sun to avoid licensing their suite.<p>Dropbox, on the other hand, has no clear business case for opening up. They&#x27;d be adding a lot of risk to their main and only product, and for what? Good will?<p>I&#x27;m not saying they shouldn&#x27;t open up, but I don&#x27;t think we should judge them too harshly.<p>By the way, I&#x27;m very doubtful of the idea that HN has a whole has an ethical position on opening up. I&#x27;d say the mainstream position here is &quot;we like open source if and when it benefits us&quot;. Which is why you see plenty of open source libraries and programming tools, but very few open <i>consumer</i> software. Proprietary SaaS is the mantra around here, not FOSS applications.",1396479371

7519561,comment,7515755,7518351,1,0,lutorm,,,"In Monte Carlo, there is something called &quot;stratified&quot; or &quot;biased&quot; sampling. It&#x27;s used to overcome the problem that if you are trying to sample a highly nonuniform probability distribution, a &quot;fair&quot; sampling based on the frequency distribution won&#x27;t tell you about the tails unless you use a lot of samples.<p>Suppose that we are trying to sample a distribution that is, say, 90% male and 10% female. If we do that with a fair sampling, and take 5 samples, chances are that we will end up with <i>no</i> females in the sample. Someone observing the sampled distribution would draw the conclusion that there are no women in the population from which the samples are drawn.<p>The solution is to <i>not</i> sample fairly, because to do so results in oversampling the common cases and undersampling the rare cases. Instead, you construct your sample such that it samples the rare cases with an artificially higher probability. You of course needs to take this into account when interpreting the samples, but that&#x27;s fine.<p>So for the topic at hand: if you want to expose someone to the widest possible range of viewpoints, sampling fairly is an inefficient thing to do. Instead, you need to split the samples into several strata, be they gender, cultural background, wealth, anything you can think of, and then <i>make sure that all parts of those distributions are represented in your sample</i>. Otherwise, with a limited number of samples, you&#x27;ll never encounter the rare instances.<p>In other words, you need to &quot;carefully structure inequality in&quot;, as you say.",1396478390

Care to explain how that can be taken &quot;out of context?&quot; Even if the rest of the audit was a complete lie, that would still be &quot;brutal.&quot;<p>From the ISEC REPORT:<p>&quot;CryptoCat&#x27;s OTR implementation on <i>all platforms</i> allows a chat peer to change their OTR key during a chat session without user notiﬁcation. An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack against the client&#x27;s XMPP or HTTPS stream can inject their own OTR key in the discussion after a user has authenticated their peer&#x27;s OTR ﬁngerprint. This permits the attacker to decrypt all messages that follow, and no user would have reason to suspect the compromise. Group multi-party discussions do not seem to suﬀer from the same vulnerability.&quot; (emphasis mine)<p>Your response in the blog:<p>&quot;... This is a problem that can be exploited in some real-world scenarios and needs to be addressed with appropriate authentication warnings. Thanks to these audits, this issue was caught in Cryptocat for iPhone before it was released.

The problem is, advertisers don&#x27;t know that, and nobody&#x27;s making an effort to educate them. Everyone&#x27;s still chasing impression levels and scale, presuming that conversions will always be awful.<p>The pubs who break this cycle will be the ones who invest in high-quality journalism <i>and</i> high-quality analytics <i>and</i> innovative ad models. It&#x27;s time for us to completely rethink the journalism ad model. Only then will we change things.<p>I apologize if I sound like I&#x27;m on a soapbox here. It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;ve spent the better part of this past year wrestling with this problem at various publications, and close to a decade wrestling with it in the TV business before that. The Homogeneous Audience Theory is one of the great, untackled problems in media today. Everyone knows audiences can be segmented. Few people do it. Instead, people assume conversion percentages will always be a tiny fraction, and thus, their job is to multiply that fraction by a huge set of eyeballs. Let&#x27;s reengineer that equation in favor of the conversion multiplier, by way of building more purposeful and curated audiences.",1396477360

3565802,comment,3564569,3564569,15,0,bitanarch,,,"One of the lessons I've learned in my startup life (2 years) was to never deal with people who aren't competent with execution - what's the right thing to do, how to reason about it in a logical way, how to do it, how to finish it, contingency plans, etc.<p>""Try him out for the junk drawer job in the startup  CEO"" is a terribly easy mistake to make, when you're still at early stage with nothing to show. I've done this for almost all the positions in my previous companies - programmers, ""product"" guy, all the way up to the CEO and investors look-alikes, and I regretted it every time.<p>When my CEO was still a business school student of a certain prestigious university, I thought he's well connected and would be a valuable partner later. The company did well for a time - but mostly besides him. Once he took over the reins, everything went downhill and the company never came back to its former glory - despite the CEO's claims of ""funding is near"", ""I'm good friends with <insert big name here> and he'll cough up $50k without a blink"" for a full 2 years. Every time I called him out for non-performance, he plays the ""CTO is not a team player"" card. But I believed him, for 2 years - all the way until he badmouthed his partner - me - to his friends right in front of my eyes. And for quite some time I actually thought I should keep the company breakup somewhat secret. Silly me.<p>Bad ""product"" guy... got him because he's a friend and he looked somewhat experienced. Ok.. now we've agreed the product would do this and that, now draw me something please? Uhh... wtf is that? He stayed for a few months, was fired, but caused the company some trouble after that.<p>Bad programmers.. went through quite a few of them, mostly contracted. Some even from big named universities with very impressive looking resumes. Again, hired them because of a sense of urgency (e.g. need to demo X to VCs soon!), so I lowered my bar to what I thought I could get. Wrong - those ended up wasting time rather than contributing.<p>At the end of the two years, I think I must have went through 2 dozens of people, co-founders included. Of the 2 dozens, only 2 of the choices were right - one programmer, one junior product guy. The others are all a waste of time.<p>If I were to do a startup again, I'd be super careful at picking who I work with. PG's advice at getting a co-founder? Yes it's definitely needed. But trying to do something investors like while sacrificing quality? That's the #1 startup mistake to make, IMHO. Don't do that.",1328690983

3565752,comment,3564987,3565636,1,0,jerfelix,,,"Not paying taxes harms people???  That's pretty funny.
Yeah, it harms the person not paying taxes.<p>Your false assumption is that people (as a whole) wouldn't pay an equivalent amount, or more, to charitable organizations or government, if they were not compelled to pay taxes.  It's very closed-minded.  I'm actually somewhat shocked at the responses on HN, because this crowd usually doesn't jump to unproven conclusions.<p>> Not paying taxes means that people take from society without giving back their fair share. [citation needed]<p>> Not paying taxes means million of kids sleeping hungry for no fault of their own but being born in to wrong parent. [citation needed]<p>> It means crime running rampant, as there is no police to stop criminals. [citation needed]<p>You, too, are making the leap that compulsory taxes are the only way to raise money for services.  It's already been demonstrated numerous times, every day, that voluntary contributions can fund every one of these services.  Not only that, but it can be done more efficiently than through a tax system.<p>Point by point:  first addressing People who don't pay taxes don't pay their fair share.  It seems to me that someone like Bill Gates or Warren Buffett (who happen to be the EXTREME, so should be great examples to PROVE your case), actually pay FAR MORE than their ""fair share"" (whatever that is - apparently you have some sort of formula), by donating vast amounts of wealth to charity (to keep kids from sleeping hungry).<p>People cite Romney as an example of someone ""not paying his fair share"", yet he gave far more to charity than most people.<p>Great use of the ""Think of the Children"" argument, by the way.  Suckers everywhere would fall for it.  But the fact remains that charitable organizations, through VOLUNTARY contributions do tremendous work in the US and around the world.  Filtering charity through government bureaucracy and waste, in an effort to ""help the children"" is nonsense.  People WANT to live in a society free from starving children, which is why charity does as well as it does.  Imagine how much MORE it could do, if we weren't FORCED to pay the government.<p>People also want to live in crime-free environments, and people with the most to lose may have extra incentive to do so.  So much so that private security forces are funded all the time voluntarily.<p>I haven't read an argument yet that has convinced me that I can decide what someone's ""fair share"" is, and force them to pay it based on MY arbitrary decision.  I DO have a sense of what is reasonable for me to pay, and I do believe in generosity.  But I'd rather give because it's the right thing to do, not give because someone made me.  But I still willingly pay my taxes ""honestly"".  I just don't think it's right that I dictate how much someone else pays.<p>As I have shown, the argument really can't be extended to theft.  Freedom does not extend to harming others.  ""My freedom to swing my fist stops at your nose"", or whatever that saying is.<p>Not paying taxes does not inherently harm anyone except the non-taxpayer, who goes to jail.  There are plenty of other ways to ""pay your fair share"" as you say, without being forcibly compelled to do so.",1328689805

Playing the game, I'd say I'm an introvert, and to be honest, the cool thing about this is realizing that all I really need is time for myself. It doesn't really matter what happens or what the circumstances are, as long as I have a book or a computer or a pencil I'm pretty much happy in my own little bubble.<p>Because I used to love sharing what I discovered in that little bubble so much, I went through a phase where I learned public speaking, and also connecting to people. I usually do this one and one, but find it very easy to establish deep connections by actually cutting through the ""bullshit"". I then started a company, and had to put myself out there quite a bit more. Having had no real experience of social contacts before though (except these connections with I have to admit people pretty much far out there), I went far overboard, which came back to bite me. I think that is the biggest issue with all the ""introversion"" (not really thinking about reaching out to other people, maybe even not really thinking about myself as a person nor other people at all). I have no real concept of emotions, of how people could react, that people can do things that hurt, that you can do things that hurt other people, etc... I am now 30, I still believe that people are fundamentally good, but I see the shades of gray in their actions. That's stuff that more ""extrovert"" people probably learn at age 15.<p>The older I get the more I realize that I actually need social contact, at least a few times a week. And I'm definitely struggling with that very much. After that ""getting out there thing"", and running into a few quite hurtful things, I completely lashed out to the other side, going back to my hacking and art and what not, but actually actively destroying everything I produce (unless it's for a client) so that other people won't notice, and I don't feel the need to talk about it. It's a hard habit to get out from. And I still don't actually know if it would be better for other people to notice, or if being the submarine in a society where most people you notice are actively craving for recognition. Recognition feels empty, while being happy on your own is much more rewarding.<p>I hope that this book (it may be nicely written and founded, or just another substanceless self-help book) will instill a small spark of self-confidence by just putting a label on my behaviour. That never hurts.",1328688975

I was under the impression that Go has I/O multiplexing w/green threads similar to Haskell. So when you write socket.read(), it will be put into an epoll/kqueue behind the scenes and a co-operative green thread switch occurs. This way you don't have to write dirty I/O callbacks like in Node.js or Boost.Asio but you get the same effect with neater code.<p>So if Go has this feature, using libuv would not only be useless, it would be harmful because it doesn't play nice with the language runtime w.r.t. parallelism.<p>I think that writing asynchronous parallel code should be done by the compiler and the runtime, not by the coder. Node.js code is a mess of callbacks that have to be written in continuation passing style by the user. Haskell (or Go?) code that has the same effect is written like regular imperative code, which is transformed into Node-style callback code by the compiler and multiplexed by the runtime.

It barely works on Linux, doesn&#x27;t work at all on iOS or modern Android, and is in general a huge barrier to adoption for free software. Not to mention its rich history of security vulnerabilities. The only reason Flash hasn&#x27;t been completely abandoned yet is because it&#x27;s currently the only widely-supported option for DRM.<p>Anyone who has worked extensively with legacy software can tell you that the procedure for removing a deeply hated but heavily used piece of code is:<p>1. Wrap the entire mess in a giant API.<p>2. Reduce that giant API over time by rewriting bits of the mess in clean new code.<p>3. Eventually you will have a few remnants that can&#x27;t be rewritten, safely contained behind a minimal API like rotten food in a garbage bag.<p>4. Wait until the market forces requiring (3) are obsolete, which may take years.<p>5. Throw away the bag.<p>(1) is NPAPI and ActiveX. (2) is <audio>, <video>, <canvas>. (3) is EME, the trash bag that will let us isolate DRM from the rest of the browser. Don&#x27;t fight against it on the basis of hating garbage. Everyone hates garbage, it&#x27;s just that we&#x27;re more interested in watching House Of Cards than in throwing it out right now.",1381694390

6543934,comment,6542211,6543706,2,0,rektide,,,"Sure the glass slab from 1989 may have 50x or 70x bigger &quot;wires&quot; in it&#x27;s microchips, and it may have bigger pixels, but I see more in common with the $100 1989 device and the modern glass slab than I see difference and change. Sure, certainly the extra miniaturization both chip- and product- scale is good incremental change, but the componentry is the same and rate of progress has tapered massively.<p>Wireless is certainly one place we&#x27;ve been radically helped, and that&#x27;s hugely attributable to DSP processing, which is great. But see above tapering.<p>How&#x27;s this for some bounding? Let&#x27;s go back to 2000. AMD has just dropped a 1.4GHz Athlon, and is 3 years from Athlon 64. Intel, in November drops Netburst, 1.5-2GHz. Intel says are going to take NetBurst to 10GHz by 2005.<p>What I&#x27;d point out is that all these advances you cite have inflection points, something that took available technology that was on the shelf and under developed and mused over, into being radically ragingly important in a very short time. And then we milk that system heavily, get huge gains, and then... and then... cross our fingers hold our butts and wait for the next thing to jump up and remake the world. This &quot;rocket&quot; moves in fits and starts.<p>It&#x27;s easy and convenient to point to historical context as you do, and to convince ourselves of progress. Rather than take hold of these mix of points and see amazement, I see very small case studies in a larger world that loses the radical element, the dynamics, and creeps towards stasis. The number of things left on the shelf to develop, to fully industrialize into, is not unboundedly infinite. It&#x27;s up to us to dream hard, dream big, to fight the creeping in of stasis and assert our status as homo sapien, the shaper of the world about, and we need to find big enough dreams to fuel that. To do that, we need to keep everyone dreaming and potentiated, not just the Musks of today.",1381694365

This includes the armed forces, the police forces, government officials, etc. For people like the Mardi Gras bomber it would be people working at banks. They tend not to target &quot;civilians&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s a definitional problem here. Typically, terrorism is defined as targeting civilians specifically. When your targets are institutional / military, it&#x27;s called asymmetrical warfare.<p>The way you phrased it implies that there aren&#x27;t many groups out there that target civilians, and that&#x27;s emphatically not so. You have:<p>- Al Qaeda&#x27;s general strategy of targeting &quot;the West&quot;<p>- The Boston Marathon bombers<p>- The 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack<p>- The Unabomber<p>- The 2008 Mumbai attacks<p>- The 2005 London subway bombings<p>- The 2007 London car bombs<p>- PLO and other Islamist groups indiscriminate rocket strikes on Isreali settlements<p>All of these groups and organizations specifically target civilians.",1381694211

Is there one?<p>Edit: it feels like if one found a textual notation that matched the dataflow graph in the way that s-exprs match ASTs,  that could lead to a Lisp of dataflow languages.

For instance, I can easily imagine that the run-of-the-mill &quot;markup&quot; WYSIWYG workflow in Word is an excellent fit for writing a short formal letter.<p><i>Although</i>, a few years ago, a couple of friends of mine were working on their masters theses in non-computer related fields (literature and biology), they complained about Word and its tendency to get somewhat &quot;wonky&quot; when working with very large documents (I am glad I have never had to experience such a task). I talked to them about the basic ideas behind the LaTeX workflow, that writing the text and doing layout/styling are straight from the start intended to be two separate concepts--you&#x27;re either working on one or the other. And how the text content is also just that: a plain text file with a few document structure-related codes in it. A plain text file doesn&#x27;t lose whole sections or mangles up chapters for no apparent reason.<p>I was surprised to hear their reaction, they were very intrigued and would have been readily prepared to learn the basics of LaTeX, if it meant getting that peace-of-mind: that writing a large chunk of text means that it is there, without a program doing behind-the-scenes modifications on it if you decide to move parts around, or so. I say &quot;would have been&quot; because they were already quite far in their theses so it would&#x27;ve made little sense to make the switch still.<p>Because that&#x27;s really the point, isn&#x27;t it? That&#x27;s what annoys me about Word (and a lot of other word processing software btw), it just won&#x27;t keep its fingers off my document, and all sorts of things happen under-the-hood. With LaTeX (and similar solutions, perhaps Markdown) the whole workflow is different: first you write the content, with some minimal markup and structuring codes, and that&#x27;s a text file. It&#x27;s yours and nobody, no software is going to touch it. It&#x27;s <i>source code</i>. And only <i>then</i> you apply a program to it, in order to <i>compile</i> it to a display format.

If you&#x27;re on a good track, you&#x27;re more likely to stay on a good track; the same for the less-than-good tracks. Creative people will continue to gain creative competence, which is why most peak in their 50s-- it takes a long time to get good-- but I think that someone who voluntarily gives his creativity up, in order to become a social climber, if he hasn&#x27;t reclaimed it by middle age, probably won&#x27;t.<p>There are a lot of people who go into banking and consulting expecting to cash out, retire young, and become novelists or philosophers. Very few of those actually do it.",1381691111

If anything it seems like per-child costs should diminish as you have more children?<p>Also I think all these analyses that assume a BART employee is going to be a single income-earner for a family are a bit strange - surely there are some BART employees who fall under this but I&#x27;d imagine not many?  It seems like a luxury in this day and age to have a parent staying at home full time.  And honestly I find myself having trouble sympathizing with people who have a lot of kids without secure high-income employment - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the employer&#x27;s responsibility to raise wages for employees that make a very expensive lifestyle choice.  I do feel bad for their kids, but I think the responsibility for making sure they&#x27;re taken care of should be the government&#x27;s.",1381691080

When you do public speaking you have to sell <i>yourself</i> AND <i>the idea</i> (in this order, because nobody will pay attention to the idea if they are not alresdy paying attention to you). So good public speaking will always have a &quot;cult-ish vibe&quot;.<p>And unfortunately, with current declining attention spans and younger generations preference for video over text we&#x27;ll have to get used to this annoying media and its side effects.

Other than the child labor bit, I&#x27;ve seen just about everything here, too, though I expect some of the problems are simply more widespread and occur more frequently.<p>When a US factory burns down and kills all the employees inside because they&#x27;d been locked in during their 15 hour shift - which has happened more than once in Bangladesh - you can say that US factories are similar to Bangladeshi factories.<p>I agree that conditions for many workers suck, but let&#x27;s not pretend there&#x27;s much similarity.",1381690984

Smalltalk is much more readable than Python and so is Lisp.<p>I dont know why you think dots and parentheses make things easier to read. Maybe its a matter of preferences , but even though I have grown up with this style , I dont find it more readable than smalltalk.<p>I dont see<p>Door.open(1,3,30)<p>as more readable to<p>Door open: 1 times: 3 andCloseAfterMilliseconds: 30<p>And this is exactly how python code works and how smalltalk works too. Also smalltalk culture is oriented towards clean code alot more than python world. You will rarely see methods in pharo more than a few lines long. And if you do , is most likely that code has not been cleaned up. And I find that a huge plus even more than the syntax itself.<p>Of course if I had to choose without smalltalk, then python would be my first choice for readability. But still nowhere near as to how easy I understand smalltalk , even though I am using it for less than a year.",1381690949

I like how they handle their role as an underdog in the US, but I&#x27;m not under any illusions. This isn&#x27;t a grand gesture of goodwill, but a necessary evil in their eyes, I guess.",1381690875

945385,comment,944959,945070,0,0,d4ft,,,"Misleads who exactly?  There are many things to which we ascribe ratios that have nothing to do with time.  For instance, people say poker is 80% skill and 20% luck (more for tournament poker, less for limit ring games).  Does that mean we should spend 20% of our time rubbing rabbit's feet? Not to anyone who has spent anytime playing poker.<p>I have been involved in sports at a fairly high level, and to assume that 90% of athletes (or other professionals) apportion time based based on non-concrete goals is, frankly, naive.  First a non sport related example:  Let's assume we have a Rails programmer who really wants to gain experience with Scala.  I would contend there about 0% chance he sits down and says I want to spend 30% of my time learning Scala and then starts reading books.  A more realistic scenario would likely revolve around picking a project and spending time completing that project, a concrete goal.  The same holds true for a professional baseball player.  When he goes out and takes hitting practice, it is not just to hit better, it is to improve his swing motion or change his mechanics, or mess with his footwork, all concrete goals.  Yes, he wants to improve his swing, but there is no way he goes out there and says I want to spend 30% of my time improving my swing, he thinks, today I will work on my stance and tomorrow I will work on my grip etc.  Sorry if this is belaboring the point, but I think it nonsensical to assume that high-level professionals anywhere do this kind of rationing.<p>That's not say that we should do away with non-concrete goals altogether.  They are important drivers and having some indefinite goal for the future is a good mechanism to drive us to do the smaller things.  That said, it is my experience that we partition time for concrete things (heavy bag work, jump rope, complete newest incarnation of website frontend, practice mozart on piano, etc etc.) more efficiently, and most importantly way more often.",1258408583

945381,comment,944559,945167,0,0,gruseom,,,"Absolutely. These conventions are not arbitrary and the people working within them are not stupid. That they would lead to poor code in a completely different language is beside the point.<p>I went through something like this hacking in Lisp, actually. When I started out, I used long descriptive variable names; it's the CL style anyway (MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND, anyone?) Over time, I found myself using shorter and shorter names, to the point where my code is now of the sort that some of the commenters here would apparently fire me for it. Yet it's not like I somehow became less passionate about readable, clear code. What gives?<p>It took me a while to figure out. As programs get shorter (because the level of abstraction gets higher), the <i>shape</i> of the code itself becomes increasingly meaningful. (I mean the physical shape of the code as it appears on the screen.) This is doubly true of languages with very regular syntax like Lisp and K, and is a huge advantage to such regularity. Partly this is just that, since the program is shorter, more of it fits on one screen. But I think it's a deeper and more mysterious effect than that. You begin to develop an intuition for different patterns that have different semantics, as it were. Grokking these patterns becomes a big part of what you do when you read this sort of code. This effect is weaker in mainstream languages, so it's not surprising that people aren't aware of it. (Edit: although I used to joke that I could tell how good C# code was by printing out reams of it, hanging it on a wall, and stepping back 15 feet. That's an example of the effect too. It's just that in more powerful languages you don't have to step back 15 feet to see it.)<p>When you're working in a verbose language, long variable names are indispensable. You've got a whole lot of lines of code to read through, and a name like ""x"" does nothing to orient you as you switch contexts. But exactly the opposite is true of dense, concise programs. Variable names as long as even, say, ""customerID"" will dominate such programs textually, obscuring their natural shape. To increase overall clarity, you have to shorten those names to a length consonant with their semantic role. In other words, this style evolved not because people don't care about readability but because they are trying to maximize it. \nA convention like ""one letter for local vars, two for global, and three for functions"" is exactly the sort of thing that would help achieve this in a language like K.<p>Ironically, I have given a verbose expansion of what you just said:<p><i>Using single letters in a piece of code helps in outlining the structure, instead of the contents.[...] The idea is that we are emphasizing the generic relations</i><p>My excuse is exploratory writing: I've been meaning to write about this for a while to clarify how it works in my head. And I don't have time to make it shorter :)",1258408515

Changing your site is great, but you'll have to set up a development and a production environment, and make sure you run those on two separate databases to make sure that if you do something you end up regretting you can revert back without your users catching any grief.<p>(2) Pick whatever feels best and easiest to you. That choice seems to have been made for you, since you mention 'rails', but really that's a framework for a language called 'ruby'. So ruby comes first, then rails.<p>Probably your best bet is to start off with making a list of the terms that you keep coming across (rails, ruby, framework, webapp) and so on, then read the wikipedia page on each of those to give you a feel for the terminology.<p>A 'hash' is a programmers trick to turn any object (usually a string, but you can apply hashes to just about everything else) into a more or less unique number. That way it becomes easier to find things, hashing is used for many purposes but one of the main applications in programming languages is so allow you to find in a very short time an entry in a list without having to go through all the items in the list one by one.<p>Your best bet to understand this stuff given the requirements of your situation seems to be to get a book on entry-level ruby, read that until it falls apart making sure that you do and understand all the exercises, then to move on to the rails framework.<p>You can test things out but I think there are better ways of learning how to program a given framework than messing around with a live website.<p>(3) As for courses, there are lots of tutorials available online, I would advice you to find a programmer buddy, preferably one that already has experience in the field that you are interested in.<p>4) could be, depends on how much time you put in there and how much background you already have.

945372,comment,944638,945282,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I agree, but I think that TDD is probably under adopted at the moment. MVC has obvious, measurable, direct benefits to development. As does functional programming (for the right problems). The research supporting TDD is either anecdotal or murky at best.<p>One of the biggest problems with TDD (and agile), in my opinion, is that it lacks an objective feedback mechanism that makes it obvious whether it's being applied correctly. I believe any methodology must have built-in feedback to ensure that it's applied correctly to be practical or successful. It takes a human TDD guru to subjectively determine if a team is doing TDD ""right"" or not. Whereas other development practices, such as producing daily builds, have obvious channels of direct feedback (do you produce a build every day, is it broken, does it use up-to-date sources, etc.). I believe that aspects of TDD will ultimately become part of a larger set of methodologies which together provide obvious, measurable benefits to development of many if not most software projects. But today the case for TDD as a one-size-fits-all methodology is far from conclusive.",1258408261

Even though Apple's model isn't free, I still see it as beneficial to all involved.<p>Apple's ""tax"" provides resources and a revenue stream to cover everything from documentation to hosting the free applications. It could also play a part in driving the prices of the phone itself down. It also gives it clear bragging points which it's used quite successfully.<p>The user benefits from the applications, and one could assume the lack of clutter/meaningless/duplicative applications within the store itself. They also benefit from the ""full product"" phone->store->apps->payment ecology.<p>The developer wins because they get to develop towards a product that has a great feature set, an ecology with paying customers and momentum in the product itself.<p>Windows, Blackberry, Palm et all have all had ways to work with previous products before the IPhone without issue, under the free market approach.

But that multiplication table held not the numbers 1-10, but pi, and i, and all sorts of other crazy future symbols. If you looked at the sheet, you would find that the correct answers were all there to all their decimal places - that's right, the man was a complete badass at math. And logic. And innovation. He was the type of guy who would ask dickish questions in university classes, which he finished when he was 13. At five months old he beat his mom at math, and his mom was pretty awesome.<p>He read his idea journal, and it was like reading science fiction because he couldn't remember what he wrote at 2am last night. He lived in a research center, where he goofed off but was still awesome. He had a paranoia of doing math in the dark (e.g. at 2am) which he never could justify to others. So on this day of year 3065 of The Future, he went to bed.<p>And had a nightmare about being surrounded by Big Black Machines (I kid you not). He thought he could use logic to get out, but ended up sweating a lot instead.<p>You would think he would shower, but no, he just dressed and shaved. Usually, people shave and then dress, but not this man. He felt strange, like that time he thought he proved time travel (but it was just wormholes).<p>He drove to the office where his realistic and probably conscious submissive fembot greeted him.<p>He used Google and manually made a database of all the webpages he visited (grand technologies like ""Google Chrome"" were lost to the ages). As usual, he wasted most of the day reading 1000-year-old blog posts about how crappy DRM was.<p>He got back to ""work"" though. Turns out, everyone except him stopped caring about the origins of life, the universe, and all that.<p>""Hey babe, get me some coffee!"" The smack on the ass that he gave his female robot coincided with the exclamation point.<p>""It's bad for you, sir.""<p>""Don't care.""<p>She brought it.<p>""What are you working on, sir?""<p>""You damn well know what I'm working on based on my search queries, which I know you peek in on.""<p>""...any luck?""<p>""Not on finding out the origin of the universe. But that's because I'm working on finding out what's real. People seem to...""<p>""Ignore, sir?""<p>""Stop trying to end my sentences, sugarbuns.""<p>""Sorry, sir. By the way, I was reading Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist and...""<p>And then it struck him. Maybe he was in the Matrix. A quote floated into his head, ""we are someones dream but of whom we cannot know"". He decided to get to work.<p>The story is not good. It's actually pretty bad, but all early stories are bad, so don't worry. My advice is to read a lot of science fiction, and a lot about how to write, how to write SF, and how to write short stories. Pick something and focus on it. In this story, you don't even have anything to focus on - what theory of reality are you actually getting at, and why doesn't it permeate the story? Never describe how awesome things are.",1258407704

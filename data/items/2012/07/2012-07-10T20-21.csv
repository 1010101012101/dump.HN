4226165,comment,4224845,4225297,2,0,matan_a,,,"We've been using Pig extensively for our MR queries and we're very happy with it.  While i haven't used Cascading, i do like the pipelining approach of Pig more than the SQL-influence method of Hive.  It lends itself better for meeting our needs.<p>Testing is a good point.  If you're running Pig through their APIs it is definitely easier to test than command-line running scripts.  We've written test code that reads and runs pig scripts through the API using fixed sample data (stored in HDFS for easy access), read the results, and compare it to expected results (also stored in HDFS).  Honestly, you don't need too much input data to prove the correctness of the query.<p>Remember that Pig also supports placeholders in your scripts so you that you can set them in run-time to define input/output paths, etc.  This makes testing easier.<p>Dependencies can also be stored in HDFS which makes it simple to run your scripts w/o the need to distribute jars around.",1341953946

If they are for the profit of the few at the expense of the many now, that is because it is the business model we have permitted.<p>Is that really true compared to Silicon Valley? Do banks concentrate wealth a lot more than a Google or a Facebook? If not, how would you feel about some random dude commenting on his blog: ""We need to rethink as a society what tech startups are for, what angel investors are for, and what venture capitalists are for. If they are for the profit of the few at the expense of the many now, that is because it is the business model we have permitted.""?<p>Regardless, if banks are ""concentrating wealth"" they must be doing something right since after all, the ultimate purpose of a business is to make money. If they do so through illegal means (fraud, deception, etc.), we already have a legal system in place to deal with that. If they don't serve us well, we have the ability to vote with our money and move to another bank which treats us well.<p>If those two mechanisms are failing us, as some people claim, I'd be genuinely curious to know why it fails specifically for banks while it works wonders in other industries such as tech. I'm tempted to think that it is because the barrier to entry to the banking industry is so amazingly high <i>largely due to regulations</i> that it favors a few large banks at the expense of eventual competitors.

Yes they do, for certain jobs. The fact that there ARE countless variables gives me pause about the viability of this project. You either try to provide a service which github/37signals would hire which they will never do (they would try to steal all the people away but they wouldn't outsource) or you are trying to give less high brow companies 'worth for their money'.<p>I think in GENERAL the market is big enough for this, it's just an uphill battle as most companies won't listen. They are price focused EVEN though they had very bad experiences. We have people calling: 'I have had very bad experiences on freelancer.com, so now I want a local person, I found you. I paid $2000 on freelancer.com and that was shit, so i'm thinking $5k max here.'. This is just very normal behavior. Without seeing the project I'm 100% sure, after reading that, that this project will be FAR over $20k to build, not $5k. This is, however, not what the buyer thinks. Issues like that are by far the biggest part of the market. And enterprises probably won't use the services as they want to be pampered locally (so it can be a frontoffice service in front of this, but not just this).<p>Also; 'technical skills are easy to pick up'. Right. I agree with the people skill part, but technical skills are easy to pick up is complete rubbish. It's just simply not true. 'Cheap developers' do not only lack people skills as you are implying; they are mostly just really bad and not capable of 'picking up technical skills easily'. I can copy interviews with CS Master graduates with 3+ years experiences showing that after roughly 10 years of study + experience 'nothing' was mastered. And that's not an exception. I understand that your experiences are different; I would like to see what you mean in that case. We have managed to turn every promising/talented devs into very valuable developers with people skills; there are a few (really a few, like 1 or 2 on over 500) who where so Rainman that it didn't work, but the rest did. So what kind of 'cheap developers' do you mean, because I think we mean the same thing but you just call that people skills?<p>But yes, right here is; people skills and especially quite advanced people skills and project management skills are needed to do large projects where this pesky money thing hardly ever appears; these people are very hard to get on this site. If you have those skills you are worth A LOT of money and if you have those skills you know you are because you learned those skills somewhere.<p>If OP gets this going i'm willing to help (for free) giving advice if wanted (I have lead and done 1000s of projects, direct or indirect, for big and small companies) and just talk about the problems in this market. I'm not looking for money or a % or a job; i'm just very interested in the subject. That's why I recognize the problems and I would like to brainstorm about the possibilities as I find the challenges here very interesting. So if you want to mail me, please do.",1341953346

4225948,comment,4224202,4224589,3,0,strlen,,,"For what it's worth, Cornell is the only Ivy League school amongst the top-10 for CS.<p>That said, there is still a strong reason to consider a private university (even if they are not in the top 10 for CS, but are still amongst the top 25). Many of the flag ship state universities do not directly admit students to the CS department. CS major is considered ""impacted"", and admission criteria may have very little to do with programming ability (e.g., UW CSE emphasizes grades in Physics and Math).<p>OTOH, I believe you can still transfer into the UC Berkeley BA CS program -- in the College of Arts and Letters from a community college with ~3.6-3.8 GPA. Transferring or getting admitted into the BS EECS program (in the school of engineering) is much harder, but the CS classes the students take are no different. The ""BA"" vs. ""BS"" means very little at Berkeley, as they also grant BAs in Physics/Math/etc...<p>If you're intrinsically motivated and are fairly set on being a software engineer or going to grad school in CS (as opposed to also pondering electrical/computer engineering), going to a community college which is considered a feeder school for Berkeley (such as De Anza College) and transferring into the BA CS program at Berkeley/UCLA/UCSD/UCSC seems to be route of least resistance.<p>Of course the big downsides are losing the first 2-3[1] years of the social ""college experience"" (important if you're more interested in entrepreneurship rather than being an individual contributor) as well as limited internship opportunities during freshman/sophomore years (OTOH participating in open source or doing side projects will help greatly).<p>[1] It can take up 3 or more years to transfer due to lack of space in many general education and major pre-requisite classes: I was unable to register in a vector calculus class until sophomore year just due to supply/demand and lack of registration priority.",1341951748

4225946,comment,4223731,4224414,10,0,seldo,,,"The short answer is that we believe running your own instances gives better performance and reliability than RDS. However, the cost is complexity: I'm a relatively experienced DBA, and we've since hired a second person with deep MySQL experience. If MySQL admin is something you don't want to spend much time doing, you may be willing to make the performance sacrifice of RDS.<p>The longer answer is that we don't use RDS because it relies on EBS, and we do not trust EBS for any critical applications. Instead, we put our data on instance storage (aka ""ephemeral"" storage).<p>This has two big disadvantages:<p>a) portability: you can't detach the drive and move it to a new instance like you can with EBS -- to clone or backup, you have to copy over the network, which is much slower (and obviously, if you kill the instance, you lose the data).<p>b) storage: you are limited in how big your DB can be. An AWS large instance these days gives you nearly 1TB of instance storage, but if you have a single DB larger than that, you need to use EBS if you're on Amazon. (Of course, if you care about performance and your database is > 1TB, you should probably be looking at sharding across multiple machines anyway)<p>However, using instance storage has two big advantages that we think outweigh those:<p>a) performance. EBS is basically a network drive. Total I/O operations per second (iops) is punishingly low. If you have a high transaction rate on your database you're going to really hate it. As I mentioned, RDS tries to mitigate this by using multiple EBS drives, but we consider that a band-aid on a pretty fundamental problem with EBS. Instance storage on the other hand is physically local to the VM's host machine, and is therefore much faster.<p>b) reliability. After 3 years on AWS, our trust in EBS is zero. It fails too often, and its failure pattern is awful: you tend to lose big batches of EBS drives at the same time, and whenever there been a major EBS failure, the API used to launch replacement volumes has failed at the same time, making replacement impossible. Again, we think this is a fundamental problem with the nature of EBS and unlikely to change.",1341951739

 When only one pilot operates the sidestick his demand is sent to the computers.
 When the other pilot operates his sidestick in the same or opposite direction both pilots inputs are algebraically added. The addition is limited to single stick maximum deflection.
Note : In the event of simultaneous input on both sidesticks (2 deflection off the neutral position in any direction) the two green SIDE STICK PRIORITY lights on the glareshield come on. In addition on A330E, the ""DUAL INPUT"" voice message activates).
A pilot can deactivate the other stick and take full control by pressing and keeping pressed his takeover pushbutton.
For latching the priority condition, it is recommended to press the takeover pushbutton for more than 40 seconds. The takeover pushbutton can then be released without losing priority.
However, at any time, a deactivated stick can be reactivated by momentarily pressing either takeover pushbutton. If both pilots press their takeover push buttons, the last pilot to press will get the priority.
Note : If an autopilot is engaged, the first action on a take over pushbutton will disengage it.",1341951675

There's a set of guidelines that have been promulgated that are used by internationally by most doctors in their professional practice.  These guidelines aren't binding on anyone, but have become accepted enough that most medical professionals working with people in this situation view them as standard practice for this procedure and follow them.<p>> Also, the Hippocratic Oath says nothing of elective surgery<p>There is no distinction as far as the Hippocratic Oath is concerned.  Elective or not, a surgery is a doctor performing services as a doctor and I would find it odd to assume their oaths suddenly wouldn't apply.<p>> Leave the psychology to the psychologists.<p>Current practice mostly does, in that doctors generally only do these procedures after they've been recommended by a set of psychologists or psychiatrists after evaluation.

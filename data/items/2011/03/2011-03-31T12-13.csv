A phone that is powered on (but not on a call) shouldn't be expected to use the radio much. Is it the case that the only difference was the power being on or off?<p>Any explanation given for why they compared powered-on vs. powered-off instead of, e.g., airplane vs. non-airplane mode?<p>Next, every phone I've seen with a mute feature mutes the audio FROM your phone, not TO your phone. Some phones also make a hiss even when they're supposed to be silent. Electronics can themselves hum, sometimes at a high enough frequency that only some people can hear it. Is it possible that there was an auditory difference between the two test conditions?<p>Cell phones that are off vs. on look different (e.g., screen) and feel different (e.g., heat generation). How was blinding maintained?<p>Speaking of that, how did they control for one being warmer than the other? Abstract says it was placed on the ear, so assumably the subject could feel that.<p>When they say that phones were placed on the left and right ears, what do they mean?

Yet I haven't seen anything that makes me believe that the management of HP is comparable to Apple.<p>Installing webOS on all of their PC's strikes me as a really dumb idea. From what I've read they are not delivering quality PC's these days. Associating webOS with a poor product seems like a bad idea. Also I think a boot menu will confuse the heck out of a lot of people. It seems that they are desperate to show that they are doing something with the product and this is all they could do in a reasonable time frame.<p>They have already owned Palm for a year and if that's all they got then I'm not impressed. The creativity of HP was seemingly gutted by Hurd and will need to be rebuilt.<p>We can learn a lot from the troubles Microsoft is currently having updating their phone. An important key to success is turning out to be control of the devices after they are sold. Microsoft is apparently screwed because there are so many players in the process of releasing updates with each having a vote. First Microsoft develops the update but then the device manufacturer and the carrier have to agree to the release and can change the release to fit their own needs. That's not the case with Apple. They control everything. Successful product owners will need to mimic Apple and not Microsoft. They will need a management with stones in order to get that deal if it's even possible now that there are so many alternative products the carrier can provide. Android also has this issue as can be seen by the number of OS versions that a developer has to support.<p>Where HP has an opportunity is in their enterprise connections. I think this will be a short lived advantage. HP would have to own this market before Microsoft launches an enterprise tablet and reluctance to change gives them the advantage.<p>HP has a great opportunity because they bought a great product. The odds are better than even that they will blow it.",1301576035

The biggest thing is getting to know your candidates and understanding their goals, desires, and path. There are so many recruiters who are in the game because they aren't good enough for sales or not really qualified for much else. This gives the industry a bad name.  Not a lot of people go through college with the dream of being a recruiter, but many end up there for lack of other options.<p>Changing the recruitment game is hard because there are so many little IT shops popping up with the low barriers to entry, looking to be a middleman and grab their piece of the pie. They see a $10-15/hr margin in contract staffing and think, wow, this is easy money by just submitting a resume. Of course, these small contract staffing recruitment shops often have offshore recruiters because you pay them 1/5 of what a U.S. based entry level recruiter would make.<p>I am currently on the path of teaching web development to myself so I can implement my own ideas on small scale rather than relying on finding a willing technical partner.

And to say that a person can <i>only</i> contribute to an open source project if they have equivalent freedom, time and indulgence from society as our very most privileged members, is to exclude a great number of people – I’d say 99% of people – who are capable and would be wonderful additions to our community.<p>So to address your question about privilege being entwined with ability:  it is dangerous to assume a relationship between the two. I choose to question my assumptions about ability (because I know that I have biases!), because the truth is that I have no idea about other people until they actually do something.

2391301,story,,,5,1,divad12,"Open-Source Software Course at uWaterloo",,"We have a group of students at uWaterloo interested in a course where students contribute to open-source software.<p>Here's our proposal:<p>================================================================================<p>The course:\n1. Upper-year CS elective (possibly core SE course) open to Math, CS, and certain Engineering programs at the University of Waterloo.\n2. First two lectures introduces OSS (history, licenses, major projects), followed by a week of selecting and applying to projects.\n3. There would be a dashboard where the OSS community posts projects and students apply. For example, Google Summer of Code - http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/list_projects/google/gsoc2010\n4. The majority of the course (say, 10 weeks) would be working on the project.\n5. There might be a final presentation or report.\n6. Lectures (less hours than other courses) would be hosted by a prof experienced in OSS and may also consist of guest speakers (we need to get Torvalds or Stallman).\n7. Lectures will be focused on contribution tips, software practices, techniques, and tools.\n8. Part of each lecture is devoted to talk about the projects, seeking help from others, and open discussion among students.\n9. Biweekly, students give a 2-minute presentation on what they've done.\n10. Grading could be based on git commit logs, patches, weekly snippets (what was done this week, what needs to be done next week), email correspondence, and possibly a final report.\n11. Would be a very flexible and open-ended course. Students could contribute code, documentation, bug fixes, participate in a mailing list.<p>Rationale:\n1. Students can work on exciting projects like Firefox, Chromium, Apache, CPython, WordPress, etc. that have impact in school.\n2. Students learn skills relevant to co-op and the software industry.\n3. Students could get an internship or full-time offer based on their contributions.\n4. Is very relevant to real software engineering.\n5. Being a course means that students can earn a credit and have course time to work on OSS.\n6. Students gain experience and put OSS on their resumes.\n7. Upon graduation, uWaterloo students gain another edge over other students in the job market.\n8. Some of the best programmers have participated in the OSS community.\n9. Students learn software development practices, tools, and techniques, and have their code reviewed (like co-op).\n10. Students gain exposure in the online community and build up a portfolio.\n11. Students who wish to contribute but don't have the time or commitment to do it by themselves can receive guidance, mentorship, a network of peers, and a semi-structured course to assist them.\n12. Soft Eng has a design project where students work collaboratively on a programming project by themselves. CS needs something practical, hands-on like this.\n13. Develop a ""hacker"" community among programmers at Waterloo, like how VeloCity is Waterloo's entrepreneurial hub. Students meet and interact with other coders.\n14. Waterloo would be better known in the software world.\n15. Waterloo promotes itself as being innovative and risk-taking. This would likely be a unique course for which Waterloo could be a world leader.\n16. The programming community (including CS students) who make use of OSS should give back.\n17. This course could be a lot of fun!<p>For the pilot, we plan to get up to about 30 very motivated students who want to do this. This way, the University does not need to worry about lack of enrollment. Initially, to gain momentum, the faculty should reach out and find mentors/project owners who would be willing to try this out.<p>================================================================================<p>Our Software Engineering administrator has just accepted this proposal (in 8 hours!), as a course through UCOSP (http://ucosp.ca/).<p>Do you have any advice on how our school can connect with the open-source community, and get this started? How can we get mentors to sign up (like Google Summer of Code)? Would it be possible to get sponsors?",1301575820

The term 'employee' in this guide includes directors of limited companies.<p>As an employer, you'll have to deduct tax and NICs from your employees' pay each pay period and pay Employer's Class 1 NICs if they earn above a certain threshold. You pay these amounts to HMRC monthly or quarterly. If you don't send the correct amount, or if you send it in late, you may have to pay interest. After the end of the tax year you must send HMRC an Employer Annual Return (form P35 and forms P14).

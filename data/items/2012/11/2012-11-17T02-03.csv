4796989,comment,4796106,4796932,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Agreed, but if you're the founder, even if you're just one guy and an idea, you need to be able to evaluate your options.<p>Example, founder says ""We launched and got 100K users in the first weekend!"" That is fabulous, shows that they have really connected with their target market, but do they know how much money each user has to generate to pay for their expected burn rate? They should. You can say ""We're build X for Y, and we're looking to monetize the landing pages with advertising."" So what ""CPM"" do you need? (clicks per thousand) What RPM (revenue per thousand) do you need to make that work? Are there other businesses that have similar CPM/RPM numbers?<p>We're fortunate that a lot of folks can and do share their numbers with this community. I'm just encouraging founders to keep the whole equation in their thoughts between costs + engagement + revenue so they can think about ways to test against their models.<p>The three questions every founder has to wonder; Can we build it? Will people use it? Can we convince them to pay enough for it to sustain it?",1353121130

Most Ron Paul fans argue that it was actually Lew Rockwell who wrote most of that, under Ron Paul's name, and Ron Paul never read or approved of them.<p>Take that for what it's worth--I personally suspect it's somewhere between ""Ron Paul wrote all the virulently racist stuff in his newsletter"" and ""Ron Paul had no idea of anything going on in his newsletter.""",1353121051

I can talk about the nature of political movements, I studied in quite a great detail. Even in India, the nature of non violence movement was not completely non violent- Its true that non violence came as a overwhelming force for the British. But the British did deal and perceive violent revolutionary sources as a equally big threat. There is always a big debate in India that Bhagat Singh was an equally big threat to British, as much as Gandhi. There were and continued to be pockets of violence till the Indian independence.<p>Secondly, violent attacks don't often serve any thing more than 'symbolism'.In this case, there is a century long history, of a persecuted community being settled on already existing nation. Now persecuted community has its reasons, but the existing people see why they are being driven out and find no acceptable reason for that. Add to this, a massive refugee problem, being forced to live densely crowded areas. No adequate supply of food, water, medicine, electricity for 50 years now. Sub human sanitation conditions. Having to endow the humiliation to stop at check points to move around in their own country, watch their land being endlessly consumed by settlers. Coupled with this the occupier has, a endless diplomatic, military and financial support of the biggest super power in human history. The oppressed can do nothing about it, because the military option isn't even an option. Diplomatic doors are closed.<p>If you feel these sort of people to not get frustrated, something is wrong about your understanding of human emotions.<p>Its in the human nature to empathize with the oppressed. And in fact this is the biggest problem with the kind of activity Anonymous has done. Israel isn't troubled because websites are going down for a couple of hours, they are troubled that there are people with some power and say in their hands, who empathize with the Palestinians.

If it's not so hard for civilians to avoid these areas, then why is it inevitable that they be caught in the crossfire?<p>The idea that Israel is somehow free of 'blood on their hands' because they try to warn people to leave the area for the bombing doesn't make sense. Both sides have plenty of blood on their hands, yet they continue to butt heads using the same tactics over and over again as if something is going to change.

One of my friends used to work on an app called Twinkle for iPhone (<a href=""http://tapulous.com/twinkle/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tapulous.com/twinkle/</a>)...it's a twitter client with their own custom location feature so you can get all the nearby tweets (using their backend, because Twitter doesn't support it yet). The only reason why I refuse to use it with the location feature enabled is because I am thoroughly creeped out by some of the people close to me (<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/chix0r/2788921744/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/chix0r/2788921744/</a>, you get the idea). Only with the recently released 1.2 is there a blocking feature, but that sucks when it's a different person bothering you every time. In fact, Twinkle probably wouldn't be the only app I have a problem with...anything that publicly announces my location gets on my nerves. I don't mind if friends know, but announcing it to the public is something else.<p>Another consideration is that a user might want to continue in a conversation even though they're not in a location. I could actually maybe even see this as a benefit, if I wanted to join in on a conversation between people at, say, a conference without actually being there.",1223528144

However, much of our infrastructure are designed for 1000 year timescales but rely on technologies with far shorter timescales.<p>There are plenty of alternatives to powering our cars, but none currently (and none on the horizon either) that are as good (cost effective) as petroleum. The cost-benefit analysis will be changing, but we won't be able to adapt because our communities rely on cheap fuel.

(By the way, I don't think that mentioning your company as often as possible is necessarily a bad thing, as I had alluded to in the parent post.)  If you think that's a reasonable measure, though, go through my comments and find where I have ever been a troll before calling me that.  I'd expected more from long time posters.  Maybe you'll even find a congratulations post to some of your company's announcements (I'm not sure if I did in this case, but that's what I typically write.)  To rephrase my question, have you ever considered having the app track how often one mention a certain keyword in their posts, as you are already tracking their browsing history?  That way, you could say at the end of the week--""I mentioned RescueTime 20% more than last week.""  Of course, it wouldn't necessarily all be in one post in one day on News.YC--maybe in blogs, or gmail, and maybe once on average per html form post.  Isn't that a cool idea?  Thanks.",1223526352

327482,comment,326998,327046,0,0,azanar,,,"It strikes me as something that would be far more accurate in a job where a predetermined set of steps are repeatedly performed, and the time taken for each is known before hand.<p>For jobs where cognitive effort is the fuel behind productivity, measuring such effort by time spent in a particular application or lines of code written over a fixed period of time strike me as at best a middling approximation to what is produced. The lines of code ,or the end artwork, or whatever creative output you see may be the result of an rather involved and complicated thought process. Sometimes I can spend hours banging my head against a problem, and make very little progress on it. Sometimes a solution will come to me after I focus on something else for a while and let my subconscious chew on the problem. Sometimes solutions to a problem involve doing things that look to most people like anything but productive work.<p>Honestly, I think you can gauge far more about your employees' productivity by talking to them about what they are working on than you will by looking at aggregates of a limited number of data points, and trying to get a numerical representation of productivity based on that. You're likely to get a more accurate and well-rounded idea of the employee's actual productivity, while at the same time improving their morale, motivation and lessening to the feeling that they are just another cog.<p>This is not to say RescueTime doesn't have value to the worker or the employer. I think the value is far greater for the employer who trusts the employee to manage their own productivity, perhaps recommending RescueTime to help that along, than it is for an employer who imposes such a tool on their employee as a mandatory productivity metric.",1223526232

327480,comment,327096,327264,0,0,ardit33,,,"Albania.  Until 1991 there were no private cars in the country.  Only government cars, and taxis.  I remember when I was a little kid, that I would go with my friends in a road, and play/count if the next car plate was even or odd.  Even in main roads, cars would come only once or twice a minute.<p>After 91 everyone could buy a car.  My parents got their first car in 96, when traffic was pretty light.   I started driving then, and it was awesome.  Parking was easy.  My high-school friends were impressed.  I could go to the beach on my own timeline, and no need to get into a bus, or a van.  And enjoy some really nice scenery going to the south.<p>Fast forward 2007 (last time I was back home),  there is traffic everywhere, parking is hard.  Lots of shiny cars, that can't go more than 10mph b/c of the traffic.  smog/pollution increased . Etc.<p>I have a friend, that switched to bikes to get to work (he still has a car, but uses it only for out of town trips), and another one that bought a scooter, as they are much more practical.",1223526126

And, yes, I gave the person a very good and practical answer,  but the pedantic answer is to have to pointers going in different speeds,  (one one step, the other two steps at a time), and if there is a circular loop they will eventually meet.<p>Also, where you want to be in 5 years question, I answered:  ""Well, honestly I don't know.  I try not to plan so much in advance, as coming from an ex-communist country  I know first hand that 5-year plans just don't work.  But I know in the next 2-3 years  I would like to work in the server side at this company.""<p>I also, have been to an interview where the interviewer seems to have made up their mind right before the interview.  Really weird.<p>The few interviews that I have enjoyed, was a very informal one, and nothing esoteric.  I was given two assignments, to solve.

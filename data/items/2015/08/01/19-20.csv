It&#x27;s plainly obvious that Norway&#x27;s economy is highly dependent on the performance of oil. Their wealth boom the prior 15 years came almost exclusively from the big oil run.

9988456,comment,9987816,9988405,0,0,alkonaut,,,"I think it depends. In the long run the trap that must be avoided is when women (usually women) leave the workforce after having children since &quot;one parent stays at home&quot; often means &quot;mothers stay at home&quot;, after which they have a hard time reentering it (or have to re-qualify/take other jobs etc, which is a huge waste).<p>If the burden of looking after children is split more evenly between mother and father (say 1 year at a time as long as necessary) and both parents keep their careers afterwards, the difference is smaller. The question is what the state can do to encourage this kind of equality and prevent women from leaving the workforce. The view in progressive economies tends to be that it&#x27;s long parental leaves, where there is a large part earmarked for the father.<p>Edit: I should add that the US actually has a pretty decent labour force participation for women. The view that women in the US often end up &quot;homemakers&quot; after having children seems to be pretty exaggerated.<p><a href=""http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2012/ted_20120907.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2012/ted_20120907.htm</a><p>There are countries (Italy and Turkey stand out) where the situation is <i>much</i> worse, to the point where it probably makes a significant dent in the GDP/Capita.",1438458990

They&#x27;re useful anywhere you have a data that is sometimes small enough to fit within a single pointer-sized chunk, and sometimes isn&#x27;t. Strings are a good example of this: short strings can be tagged pointers, and long strings can be dynamically allocated. As another commenter mentioned, some C++ implementations use tagged pointers for std::string.<p>Another example might be a big number library, where numbers smaller than the pointer size could be implemented as tagged pointers, and larger numbers would be dynamically allocated. A C++ big number library could easily do this.<p>Whether it&#x27;s worth the cost depends on how expensive memory allocation is, how expensive pointer indirection is, how many objects are able to fit within a tagged pointer, and how expensive the tag check is. Typically the answers are, a lot, a lot, a lot, and a lot. And dynamism doesn&#x27;t change the answer much.",1438458816

I just know my ex-employee contacted me about with the impression that Mark owned this account, I hadn&#x27;t questioned it, and it was presented as &quot;Mark is at it again&quot;<p>* I think gross incompetence happened, and Mark tried to cover it up. I don&#x27;t believe he is outright malicious, but certainly ignorantly-malicious.<p>* [Mark&#x27;s] salary was the same as mine at that time. ... I started at 240000yen/month (~$3.1K/mo - ~$37K/yr), and was paid 320000yen/month (~$4.1K/mo - ~50K/yr) from about August 2011. I was the highest paid employee (including Mark) when I left the company.<p>* &quot;Where do you think the millions of depositors fiat have gone to?&quot; -- Nooooooo fucking idea. I hope to read about it the same as you do. I want answers.<p>* &quot;Why was Ross Ulbricht&#x27;s Gox account banned very early on?&quot; -- Honestly, no idea. I know that Mark banned any accounts blatantly linked to SR. Some people emailed that they needed to use their undeposited cash to buy things on SR. If that made it to Mark, he banned it. I think it was safe practice.<p>* &quot;Since this is AMA: How come you chose this particular time to come out with this AMA? Why now and not earlier?&quot; -- I think I mentioned in different comment threads, I had an NDA that prohibited me from talking about Mt.Gox. It&#x27;s still enforceable, but I think Mark has other things to worry about at the moment... I hope :/<p>* I stopped believe anything he [Mark] said after a month of working there.<p>* &quot;Reuters reported that expensive toys were being purchased by MtGox/Mark. Do you have any more examples of luxurious spending?&quot; -- He bout a NAO for $5k in August 2011, a Makerbot a little later, and... Ahem, I had to talk him down from buying a Lamborghini as his first car. Respectively, the Honda civic was a modest purchase. (how to fuck could I explain a Lamborghini to 50% of the employees making under $2000 a month... it would have killed moral, even moreso<p>* &quot;I find it incredibly irresponsible that no employee or ex-employee blew the whistle on what was going on.&quot; -- There was no proof, no one (mark) gave anyone access to anything directly. Everything was inferred. (Spent 900K, made x00K?) where did that come from? No answers... what can you report on that ... :/ It sucked....<p>* &quot;Do you think Mark is guilty of actually manipulating data in a fraudulent manner, or merely negligence in operating MtGox?&quot; -- Both. but only the latter do I have an experience.",1438458490

Two people make a financial agreement, hire lawyers, and depend on a powerful police force and and penal system to enforce the terms of their contract. This increases the need for armed police, prisons, etc. As more people and institutions are given the right to enact violence to enforce these contracts, people become more desensitized to violence and arrest and more opportunities for abuse present themselves. Abstracting this enforcement into software also distances the enforcement from the culture and removes some of the negative psychological effects on people of carrying out that enforcement.<p>That&#x27;s on the smaller scale. On the larger scale, nations feel pressure into increasingly more arms races to keep themselves on an even level. Abstracting enforcement of agreements into software can have the same effect as the introduction of diplomacy into international trade. While it didn&#x27;t eliminate war, it offered an alternative to straight-out aggression between tribes. Groups that used to stay to themselves and interact with each other only on disputed borders were able to cooperate on a much higher level by establishing representatives inside each others borders.<p>A smart contract system is a neutral, diplomatic ground for the Internet. Today, the Internet resembles in many ways the world before diplomacy. There is a persistent, escalating cyber-war between nations. People can move in between nations, but there&#x27;s no real neutral territory that every nation would consider fair. By having a mutually-agreed and verifiably trustworthy software platform to enact contracts, there can be opportunities for new types of deals that are more mutually beneficial.<p>Will this suddenly eliminate war and hostility? Of course not. Neither did diplomacy. But almost nobody thinks we should go back to a world without any diplomacy, and once we have neutral and fair systems to conduct electronic business, few will want to give it up.",1438458028

Clients read this data and implement it in their own way depending on how you&#x27;re reading it, what kind of client you&#x27;re using (screen-reader, etc.), whether you&#x27;re on a mobile or a tablet, etc. No need for this responsive design bullshit that just wastes a ton of money and time for everyone involved.<p>You may be asking yourself, how are we going to &quot;design&quot; this web? The answer is still CSS and JavaScript, with the added use of web components. Web components attach behavior and styling to your elements, and can even allow the browser to interpret new elements for you that inherit from other elements or components. This means that `<div class=&quot;the-actual-element&quot;>` goes away, and we are left with a tag name that actually tells you what kind of content there is inside, class names that specify &quot;mixins&quot; to load in styles or event bindings for multiple elements, and the content of the element can be styled in any way.<p>All that aside, I still wonder if HTML is the &quot;right&quot; language for the job. Sure, it&#x27;s in use everywhere, but why? Could we make something better and lighter for browsers to interpret, so that the same document could be parsed quickly by an API client of some kind? I really like the significant whitespace of Haml, and especially Slim&#x27;s DSL which lets you just define new elements without prefixing them with &#x27;%&#x27;. Although Haml is pretty sweet, a language looking like Slim would clearly be less annoying to type out given most of your elements are totally custom. What I&#x27;d really like is a language which combines Slim for document layout and Markdown for copywriting:<p><pre><code>  article#the-name-of-my-article\n    title\n      The name of my article\n    preview\n      This is a preview of the article content.

However, there are also some explanations for this:\nXenophobia: Swiss are probably less xenophobic than other countries I have experienced (including the US where I was mildly surprised about some things. Of course you shouldn&#x27;t tell it loudly at your work-place). About one third of the population in Switzerland are foreigners and the number has been strongly increasing in the last few years. I think Swiss are fed up about &quot;soldiers&quot; (aka expats) and other foreigners that don&#x27;t want to integrate. I had some bosses that didn&#x27;t speak German and also didn&#x27;t understand that some things are socially unacceptable. Unlike other countries, there is rarely violence towards foreigners.\nBanks: I worked in banking. Other countries do the same as Switzerland. When you go to a German bank just over the border as a Swiss until recently, they will tell you that you can hide your money there and tax authorities in Switzerland won&#x27;t know. I won&#x27;t speak of Delaware, Miami, Singapore, Hong Kong and all these other places. The US is well-know for having ambiguous policies. Bankers in Miami are specialized in taking money from Latin America. \nPrices: Prices are a lot higher for certain things. You can go shopping in Germany to save money. Some other items, e.g. electronics, are cheaper except for the US. Expect to pay high prices for rent, meat, vegetable, other fixed costs (health insurance, electricity etc.). However, the money left after your fixed costs is a lot more than the average person in another country. And to revert back to xenophobia, there are foreigners that somehow are unaware of the prices and accept low offers. Swiss don&#x27;t like them very much.\nWorking: I worked in New York (not the US I know). I worked on a fixed two-year contract, so I couldn&#x27;t be terminated. My US colleagues had an at-will contract. I always thought it crazy what my colleagues were willing to put up with. When they got a better offer, they just disappeared within a few days. But I had to adapt because I was the foreigner and the Swiss nowadays also expect you better adapt and integrate (see xenophobia) or you better leave Switzerland.\nAlthough I lived in the US for some time, I&#x27;m a strong supporter of limiting the number of foreigners in Switzerland. It&#x27;s not in Switzerland&#x27;s interest but more in the interest of employers who try to take advantage of it.",1438457064

6165369,comment,6165315,6165315,1,0,ignostic,,,"This philosophy doesn&#x27;t sit well with me. Physics at a particle or even mass scale can be described mathematically, I&#x27;ll give you that. That said, if you are to understand the relationship between one particle and another, you need some way to explain that relationship.<p>For example, the pull of one celestial body of matter on another (really the sum of particles, but let&#x27;s simplify) can be explained with math. But you cannot communicate the RELATIONSHIP between the two without understanding the concept of gravity and space-time. It would be claiming the universe is all 1s and 0s, ignoring the fact that there must be a en/decoding method - a meaning to the numbers - for them to make any sense.<p>The weaker claim that the universe CAN BE computed is to me fairly obvious, but that adds little to any discussion among those who believe in causality.",1375775918

Gossiping and commenting also has the potential to form shared opinions and values within the group that attends the meeting, not to mention a certain group-think. There is a possibility that these values diverge from what would result from public discourse.<p>I would hypothesize that the mere fact of being invited to a traditionally secret club tends to make people more selfish, arrogant, and prone to abuse their power. I don&#x27;t know this for a fact, but other results of psychological studies that I have heard of make it seem very plausible.<p>This is especially important with politicians. Politicians are supposed to be servants of the people. If we take psychological studies that point to a &quot;fake it until you become it&quot;-effect seriously, we should demand of politicians to also <i>behave</i> and <i>carry themselves</i> like servants. The Bilderberger group is a venue (admittedly, one of many) where politicians can become detached from their duties.<p>So like I said, it&#x27;s less flashy than a Hollywood-movie conspiracy, but important nonetheless.",1375775580

Seems kinda random<p>There is a religious subset of the libertarian crowd that is all about those four issues.  School choice means religious and/or home schooling (which tends to also be religion centered).<p>Their intersection with the civil liberties crowd is pretty small - they dislike acknowledging that there are systemic problems beyond their main issues.  For example they don&#x27;t believe in anti-discrimination laws because they say the market place (private property and economic liberty) will sort it all out - despite all historical evidence to the contrary.<p>For me, seeing that list would make me wary.  My impression of such groups is that there are indeed some people who truly believe that but there are plenty for which it is simply cover for bigotry.<p>The enemy of my enemy isn&#x27;t necessarily my friend.",1375775569

These modifications are performed by coalitions of different parties with differing ideologies, leading to a constantly shifting &quot;single ideology&quot;. Sometimes these parties and coalitions are formed as a direct response to consequences of the current policy.<p>Which is the point of a democracy. A democracy&#x27;s central thesis is that any given policy is probably not-quite-right and that it always merits reconsideration in the near future.<p>> Real pluralism is about de jure authority and de facto power being distributed among many institutions in society, not concentrated entirely in a single one.<p>How is this not the case in a democracy? The assertion that country=government does not require that the number of institutions in the country/government be merely one. Asserting a distinction does not merely bump the number of institutions from one to two, which would be insufficiently pluralistic anyways. Pluralism comes from the liberal doctrine of individualism; it&#x27;s a natural consequence of asserting the individual worthiness and dignity, which demands that the individual&#x27;s concerns be considered in some fashion.<p>Making a false distinction between state and society is useful only for disempowering citizens who see themselves as part of one but not the other, negating their willingness to provide a voice to the cacophony of pluralism. Our disdain for politics is precisely what grants politicians so much power: because <i>someone</i> has to do their job and they&#x27;re willing. If only the supply were higher so that the power granted by their office could be diluted by sheer interchangeability.<p>Why do we rely so heavily on the fourth estate to speak on our behalf? To be the voice of society holding accountable the state? Why are we ourselves not speaking? Yes, there are things stopping us, and we need to know what and why and how to remove those impediments. Instead of having our voices subsumed into mass outcries, we need to have our voices individually acknowledged. Pluralism isn&#x27;t about having political speechwriters making dialogue with investigative reporters and mogul-owned pundits. It&#x27;s about <i>all of us</i> talking.",1375774966

See for example this meta-study from 2008 about what happens when health workers go on strike [1]:<p>&quot;[..] mortality either stayed the same or decreased during, and in some cases, after the strike. [No study] found that mortality increased during the weeks of the strikes compared to other time periods.&quot;<p>The authors speculate about the reasons:\n&quot;The paradoxical finding that physician strikes are associated with reduced mortality may be explained by several factors. Most importantly, elective surgeries are curtailed during strikes. Further, hospitals often re-assign scarce staff and emergency care was available during all of the strikes.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18849101"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18849101</a><p>EDIT: clarity",1375772562

2604828,comment,2602463,2604778,3,0,DavidMcLaughlin,,,"> So, using _ in any expression makes that expression an anonymous function?<p>Ah, I should have said - the syntax above only works with one-liners. The following wouldn't work:<p><pre><code>    scala> apply(val y = _ * 50; y * 100, 10)
    scala> apply((val y = _ * 50; y * 100), 10)
    scala> apply((x: Int) => val y = x * 50; y * 100, 10)
</code></pre>
etc.<p>Instead you would need to explicitly surround the method body with curly brackets:<p><pre><code>    scala> apply((x:Int) => { val y = x * 20; y }, 10)
    res18: Int = 200

</code></pre>
And in this case, it's obvious what is happening.<p>So it's more like providing a one line expression where a function is expected makes it an anonymous function. The use of _ is simply a shortcut when you don't need to assign parameters to a local variable. It even works with multiple parameters. I.e. compare:<p><pre><code>    scala> (1 to 5).foldLeft(0)((accumulator:Int,x:Int) => accumulator + x)
    res22: Int = 15
</code></pre>
To:<p><pre><code>    scala> (1 to 5).foldLeft(0)(_ + _)
    res19: Int = 15</code></pre>",1306879099

Luckily never had my bike nicked, but I <i>was</i> assaulted when I was working in a supermarket there one summer and the police turned up, basically told me it was pointless going after the guy and didn't seem to give one shit about the fact I'd just been attacked (to be fair - he pushed me into a display rather than hit me, but still).<p>Had a couple friends get mugged, luckily not me, in neither incident were the police even involved I don't think. People just don't think to go to them for such things such is their stellar reputation.<p>Also had my (push)bike nicked when I was a kid growing up which means I never actually learnt to ride a bike (my family were too poor to buy a replacement), but I guess that's a bit out of date now!<p>I really think things are worse for this kind of crime in a smaller town because there are more idiots who think they're king of the castle, the kind of guys who would come a cropper very quickly in a bigger city like London. Let's put it this way - I've nearly been in a fight like 2-3 times + actually got assaulted once in Exeter, never had any problems in London other than once getting my phone nicked.<p>I lost all respect for the police after an inadvisable night when I went to a concert in Milton Keynes and ended up sleeping rough outside the train station waiting for the first train (I was 16 at the time). The police turned up with blankets, etc. and just sat there in their vans laughing at us. Not to mention the way the MET handles protests (google Ian Tomlinson).<p>I would like to think most coppers are ok, but I can't help but wonder whether the police is just a destination for school bullies who want a bigger scope in which to ply their trade.",1306879098

The man in the room does not speak Chinese.</i><p>I'm fairly certain that qualia--whatever it is--is not a necessary quality for the room to be capable of comprehending Chinese. It sounds like you would agree. The problem with qualia though is that there's no way for you or I to know whether the other participates in the phenomenon.<p>I'd like to mention that Dan Dennett has done a wonderful job of arguing that qualia is a bad term. I disagreed at first, but by the end of reading his argument I could only agree that the term is hopelessly ruined. You'll see his name in the Wikipedia article you linked. If you read his <i>Quining Qualia</i>[1] (I believe that is the one, though it may have been a follow up that I found so convincing) you might see the problem with arguments about whether something has or hasn't qualia.<p>1: <a href=""http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/quinqual.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/quinqual.htm</a><p>As far as I'm concerned, if my brain were adequately simulated in a computer it would be like a plaster mould of a plaster mould. They're not the same thing, but functionally they are. If qualia exists I'm happy to assume that it's the product of a physical process which can be simulated. If it does not then I am quite certain the thing people mistake for it can be simulated--and perhaps already has been.<p>My attitude on the whole qualia matter is: how important can a thing be if no one can define it well enough to measure it? More importantly, I don't believe in magic. If something special is going on there I believe it's a product of natural processes, not a cause of them.

2604705,comment,2602463,2602809,6,0,DavidMcLaughlin,,,"> The first two uses of () are anonymous functions<p>No they're not. They are just containers for arguments to a function. In Scala whenever you call a function which takes as it's only parameter another function, you can even replace them entirely with curly brackets:<p><pre><code>    scala> (1 to 5).map(_ * 5)
    res1: scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[Int] = Vector(5, 10, 15, 20, 25)
</code></pre>
is equivalent to:<p><pre><code>    scala> 1 to 5 map { _ * 5 }
    res3: scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[Int] = Vector(5, 10, 15, 20, 25)

</code></pre>
The _ symbol is equivalent to the % in your Clojure example. So both examples above are equivalent to:<p><pre><code>    scala> (1 to 5).map((x:Int) => x * 5)
    res2: scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[Int] = Vector(5, 10, 15, 20, 25)



</code></pre>
You don't need _any_ characters or visual indicators to declare an anonymous function. Example:<p><pre><code>    scala> def apply(op: Int => Int, y: Int) = op(y)

Vigilantism sometimes works.<p>My motorbike was stolen the 12hrs before I went sitting in a hedge in a field where I found some tyre tracks in some mud (nobody sensible would have a trials tire on a chicken chaser) of my bike earlier that day ( skipped classes at my EE uni course). After ~4hrs sitting in the cold and dark I hear the bike near to the field and set after it and try to pull the thief off as he goes around a roundabout (he just wobbled into the curb and goes off and I get flung to the ground). I phone the police telling them where my bike is ( I had reported the theft hours ago). I chase after the guy and he drops it somewhere (it went quiet) so I phone for my housemates only for 1 to drive home because he ""doesn't like this one bit"". I spent 20minutes waiting for the police only for me and a friend to fail at tackling the guy off the bike when he comes back and rides off.<p>I go looking for the bike with a friend (I hear it stop a long way off somewhere in a council estate) and interrogate one of the thief's friend who tried to follow the thief. Waste of time, it turned out the friend had put fake plates on his scooter. My friend miraculously spots my bike in a dark alley and we push it home. Then 3 fucking police cars turn up almost an hour after I tell them and I convince them I phoned them but I have nothing on me (I was certain I was at least going to get beaten up that night) so I get put in the cop car and taken home to get ID. Then they are happy that I wasn't the thief.<p>That was the 2nd time my bike got stolen.<p>1st time it was in a locked garage blocked by a locked car (smashed the window of the car to release handbrake and crowbarred the garage door and cut the lock. A few years later they torched the both and my bike along with my stuff stored in it [i was at uni]). Usual stuff first, police come down, take info and tell me they wont be able to find it. I bunk off school and go riding around on my mountainbike checking out all the council estates and woods near my home (Plymouth, England). Sure enough I hear it come down a path and see 2 people on it. I throw my mountainbike in front of them and they came crashing down and I banzai charge at them screaming. One of them runs for his life and the other just hung around claiming he didn't nick it (was offered a ""go"") and wanted compensation for damaging his ""trackies"". I believe him though as I had an inkling as to who knicked it. I ride out of the woods away from home with the mangled bicycle on my lap and I get my dad to come by to pick it up(<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonnobleuk/5783020123/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonnobleuk/5783020123/</a>), clear the woods between me and home and then I ride back. 
Police's response when I tell them I retrieved my bike back ""oh, good for you.""<p>For some unknown reason this heap of a bike got stolen 3 times. The 3rd time I gave up only for the police find it dragged 50meters away from my home where someone tried to use bolt-cutters on it. The police then tried to charge me 250 for retrieval fees.

Now? After the influx of the general public and the juveniles(not saying this in a demeaning manner), quality has dropped in every way. Pun and argumentative threads were the ones that were on top.

All the supposed-to-be-funny short comments probably would count as a positive under this analysis. Reddit's community now is pretty happy, confident and compassionate. The analysis is pretty lacking when applied to a supposed-to-be intellectually stimulating social site.<p>Anyway I see that Slashdot(although not as popular now) and HN seem to have bucked the trend.

It seemed to me that the OP would agree with what you are saying, up to the point where the police said they couldn't help.  He certainly doesn't explicitly say anything about <i>why</i> he is posting the photos... that said, I feel like there are two possibilities:<p>1.) He doesn't care whether the guy is the thief.  He is publishing the photos in an act of non-vengeful vigilantism, with the hopes that someone will see or recognize the guy and contact the OP.<p>2.) He is assuming the guy is the thief.  And, he is publishing the photos to harass/humiliate that person.<p>Personally I am comfortable with #1 but certainly not #2, for the reasons you cited.  In #1, the guy's innocence (or lack thereof) is irrelevant to the OP's motivations.",1306876023

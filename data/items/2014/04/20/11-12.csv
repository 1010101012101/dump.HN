7616542,comment,7615750,7616186,15,0,jnbiche,,,"As someone who is learning OCaml at the same time as Rust (and who already had some Haskell), I can attest that the power of pattern matching is well-worth the extra &quot;let&quot;.  Plus, in addition to the signal it provides to the compiler, it also provides <i>me</i> a signal to know that I&#x27;ve got a new variable and the option here to do destructuring pattern matching.  Very cool.<p>pcwalton: after getting over the hump of Rust&#x27;s pointer semantics, I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s a very elegant and fairly simple language.  So I was partially wrong about my assessment of Rust as a &quot;complex&quot; language (I say &quot;partially&quot; because the pointer semantics do add a significant layer of unavoidable complexity).<p>I&#x27;d encourage anyone put off by the complexity of Rust&#x27;s pointers to just push on through.  I think you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s worth the trouble.<p>Rust is definitely <i>the</i> language of the future for games, embedded programming, system programming and other areas of programming that require a high level of determinism.  I can&#x27;t wait until it&#x27;s stable enough to use for real projects (hopefully sometime this year).",1397995094

You can leave the earth&#x27;s gravitational pull with ANY speed. Assume that there was a magically (geostationary) floating platform 300 km above earth. There are absolutely no problems for someone on that platform to pull you up with a rope. Imagine a 1km high skyscraper...

7616471,comment,7615820,7615820,1,0,Theodores,,,"Honda should think about using some &#x27;deploy then code&#x27; philosophy with ASIMO. I know ASIMO works hard in theme parks and in the lab, however, ASIMO really needs to be in a movie to reach a large appreciative audience. The things ASIMO can&#x27;t quite do now could be CGI&#x27;d in or there could be some (stunted) stunt doubles dressed in a suit.<p>From what I understand the target audience is elderly care. I have done a fair bit of this myself on a neighbourly basis and I have witnessed how professional care workers can work - they can fill in lots of forms and somehow avoid any actual care. Imagine how dystopian things could get if elderly people had ASIMO and instead of care workers visiting them they just had an engineer to care for the ASIMO. Then imagine the Alzheimer&#x27;s disease kicking in. ASIMO could be sent off doing the same thing three thousand times a day, with a feedback loop formed, making matters worse.<p>Clearly the distant relatives would interface with ASIMO rather than their grandma/grandpa. The senile yet devious grandma/pa would do things to outwit ASIMO like regurgitate their pills or eat the bag of sugar instead of their microwave meal. So situations could develop without relatives knowing what was going on. Obviously at things like family weddings the elderly person would not actually go, instead ASIMO would do the duties including standing in the pictures, front-row due to height reasons. You would also have the problem that we have with cars - most houses have lots of them. So some people could end up with more ASIMO than occupants.<p>So, I look forward to &#x27;ASIMO the movie&#x27;, where the basic premise is basic care work - as intentioned - and how it works out in practice, ideas fully worked through on the assumption that the code can be written, e.g. to do things like change bandages. Using this &#x27;deploy then code&#x27; we could determine if this &#x27;looking after old folk&#x27; scenario is realistic.",1397992622

Cammer gets paid after the x minutes is up.<p>Cammer gets cheap money for being a personal camera man for someone somewhere else in the world.<p>Client saves a trip out there to see something for himself.<p>Use cases:\nWant to see if an antique you are looking for is at the markets but cant get away from work?. Want to check out markets in turkey but live in australia? Want to see what the surf is &quot;really&quot; like right now and whether you should bother heading out? Police work/chases! heaps of uses.<p>For popular events and markets, a cammer could setup shop and offer high quality streams etc.",1397992419

7616464,comment,7615567,7616066,1,0,Dewie,,,"Well there is the Curry-Howard correspondence. Though I don&#x27;t know if this correspondence is intuitive in the general case - I guess what this correspondence means is that programs can be translated to some computational model, which can then be translated to some formal logic, and then back again (but with these kinds of high-level facts, I&#x27;m bound to have misunderstood something, somewhere). Though this connection might be only intuitive for some kinds of languages - like statically typed functional languages.<p>I think it&#x27;s amazing that programming can leverage and express so many mathematical facts - from implementing a binary tree that is enforced to always be balanced by the type system in Haskell, to using linear types to safely use and free OS resources in ATS.",1397992275

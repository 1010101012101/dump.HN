2840000,comment,2839534,2839902,1,0,jvdongen,,,"How that exactly works is a bit too long a topic for a comment here (try google - ""public key encryption"", ""X.509"" and ""certificate authority"" are some relevant search terms if you're interested).<p>However what I'd like to point out is that 'simple eavesdropping' effectively <i>is</i> a Man-In-The-Middle attack, be it a passive one (the man in the middle is just keeping his mouth shut and only listening).<p>And eavesdropping on someones internet connection is, contrary to popular believe, not that simple.<p>The eavesdropper needs at least one of:<p>a) effectively have a (virtual) presence on either one of the endpoints of the connection 
b) unfettered access to exactly the correct pieces of equipment that are part of the internet's infrastructure. 
c) some way of persuading your traffic to take a de-tour from a remote location<p>Option a) is the easiest I guess - just drop a piece of malware on someones PC (takes care of that whole pesky SSL issue as well). Although certainly doable - I would not describe it as trivial. Most 'cyberattacks' targeted at the masses are not exactly efficient - their success largely depends on the large numbers of targets - targeting a specific person is quite a bit of work.<p>Option b) is, depending on who you are either relatively easy or nearly impossible. If it's easy for you, you've probably signed a piece of paper promising you a large bank account withdrawal and/or all kinds of 'benefits' in a state-sponsored facility if you abuse your powers. That won't stop everybody and there are parties for who it is actually their job to do this kind of things, but for the most part you can forget about option b) unless you happened to have attracted the interest of aforementioned parties. In which case I wish you good luck.<p>The feasibility of option c) depends even more on local circumstances of the victim than option a) but is a real possibility, but certainly not trivial. Something like dns-cache poisoning comes to mind.<p>So - eavesdropping is certainly possible, but I would by no means call it simple.<p>Rgds,
Jeroen",1312351128

Because I remember back in 2006 it was working perfectly.  Now their search of Usenet posts can hardly find anything.<p>Anyhow, I was working on a system once which had a very crappy implementation.  Thousands lines of code in each source file.  Spaghetti code everywhere.  I spent a lot of time fixing bugs in that system.  Clearly it wasn't productive.  I decided to completely rewrite it.  Spent a couple of months working on it, but when it was done, it had a cleaner implementation and far fewer bugs.  I noticed that I hardly spend any time on that system any more - an indirect indication that the decision to rewrite was the right one.<p>Fast forward two years.  I moved on to other projects.  A new guy comes along (senior than me actually).  His task is to make the old system work with new requirements.  He comes with an idea - a complete rewrite.  Since I worked on that system before, I get to review his design.  He explains to me how his new implementation is going to have various ""new"" features.  Then I ask him if he knows that the existing implementation does all that already and more.  He had to admit that he have no idea how the existing system works, so he doesn't want to touch it - thence the desire to rewrite.<p>I gave him my advice but he proceeded with the rewrite anyway.  The old code obviously got scrapped.  Now, looking back I can't see where his new code ended up.  Most likely his rewrite failed, so the new implementation never saw the light of day.<p>The moral of the story: even if you don't like the old system, you have to understand how it works in order to create something better.",1312349898

2839927,comment,2839742,2839742,5,0,ihodes,,,"I had similar thoughts when I was first learning a lisp. Unlike the author, I was enamored with the lack of syntax and the expressive power that was there. Sure, it's a Turing-complete language like any other, but for me it was a pleasure to hack with. Not only that, but you can actually do things with it (manipulate the language itself, from within the language itselfwhoa) that I would only later realize the power of. Turns out you rarely need to use that power.<p>For instance, I'd do (untested):<p><pre><code>    (defn prime? [x] (every? (fn [n] (not (zero? (mod x n))))                                                                                     
                             (range 2 (Math/sqrt x))))                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                  
    (doseq (map pr (filter prime? (range 0 20)))) 
</code></pre>
for the same effect. And I really was happy to write that. It makes sense.<p>NB: I'd never put such code into production, and I think it should be a warning sign that a purported problem in a language/dialect be based around minimal experience regarding an example.",1312349040

I inherited it after it had been written by a mathematician who understood the theory of how it would work, but unfortunately could not write code, and it was then given to a person who could make anything work, even if they didn't understand how it was supposed to work.<p>The result was exactly as you describe, functions which had clear logical errors but they were never called so it didn't matter, data structures where a third of the members were never populated. It took me a couple of months of back and forth before I felt I could even begin to attack it. And after implementing the kernel half and starting in on the daemon proper, Sun discovered 'divisions' and I found myself documenting like crazy so that I could 'hand off' something that wasn't a 'networking' problem.<p>I particularly liked the n-level deadlock detection algorithm, that was the experience that taught me that a data structure can represent a large set of potential computations all at once.",1312348167

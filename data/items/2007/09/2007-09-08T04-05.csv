This was about two years after Michael Dell said that he'd shut the company down and give the money back to the shareholders. Back then you'd have needed some serious crystal ball mojo to see forward to the Apple of today.",1189227429

52067,comment,51989,52064,0,0,yamada,,,"So then how do you distinguish that?  Like does YCombinator method make people succeed?  Or is it good at identifying likely future successes and convincing them to associate with YCombinator?  Or both?  How do you gage the effect either way?  In other words, does YC make the successes, or is it better at systematically finding them and associating with them? ",1189226998

The thing is, to some people, the cult's methodology <i>works</i> for their success (since many mind-control techniques are not evil by themselves, and can be used to improve one's life if used wisely).  <p>You have to look at not only those successful cases, but also the rest of cases---if the group has contributed to the success of a few celebrities, but not for the 99.9% of other members, then the success cases are likely to be by chance rather than the real result of the cult.",1189226573

52062,story,,,4,7,ratsbane,"Recycling startups?",,"Some startups, YCombinator or otherwise, aren't going to succeed, at least not enough to prevent their founders from taking other jobs or going back to school.<p>Another team might be able to take over and push the thing forward to another level, thereby giving some value to the founders and seed investors as well as a head start for themselves.<p>Kiko, which sold on eBay for $258K is the only example of this I'm aware of, at least from YC.  While it may not have been as much of a success as the founders intended, it did produce quite decent value.<p>It's encouraging to think that there is some reward, even in the long tail.<p>Who might be interested in taking over another startup?  Who might be interested in selling and moving on?  Does YC facilitate?

52059,comment,51989,51989,0,0,dood,,,"It is possible to percieve very many things as cult-like, especially if you try to imagine how people will look at them in, say, 200 years (e.g. fashion, university, jobs, using drugs, not using drugs, being a sportsfan, being a nerd, following societal norms, constantly quoting the big lebowski, etc. etc.). Play along by looking at people's lives and beliefs throughout history, and try to work out who were the least culty.<p>The conclusion I came to is that it it generally best to work things out for yourself, and rarely bad to question your assumptions.

52057,comment,51974,52048,0,0,yamada,,,"Or maybe it would be millions of computers working in concert over some sort of thing like, um ... some thing where computers all over the world can speak to each other and use parallel processing to combine computing resources into one big giant mega-mind.  And maybe just like when you see those weird videos on Spike with guys who get shot in the head and lost millions of brain cells but can still function, maybe we can isolate many many computers but the difference it will make will be negligible at best on the super-mind.  And then maybe it will fight back by triggering tax audits and false warrants for the arrest of any hackers smart enough to threaten its existence.",1189225169
52056,comment,51974,51974,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"If you want to think about the singularity, you owe it to yourself to listen to Bruce Sterling's awesome deconstruction of the subject:<p><a href=""http://www.longnow.org/projects/seminars/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.longnow.org/projects/seminars/</a>
(search for him near the bottom of the page)<p>Talk of the singularity reminds me of the furor over human cloning - it's an excellent generator of fantasy-lit plot coupons, late-night drunken dorm-room philosophy, and paranoid fundamentalist ravings, but in real life it's much more boring. I know lots of human clones - they're called ""identical twins"", and they are little different from anyone else. And, speaking as a strong AI that is composed of trillions of microscopic robots working in tandem, it's hard to be impressed by yet another strong AI like me. There's well over six billion of us already, and that's being awfully ungenerous to chimps, gorillas, dogs, and my pet parrot. If I really wanted another strong AI, wouldn't it be cheaper and easier just to stop using birth control? Or to go to the pound and adopt a friendly but unwanted puppy?<p>To pick on a different example: it is the height of human egotism to believe that our scientists can create a ""grey goo"" that would scare a bacterium, let alone me. Bacteria have been dividing every few minutes for <i>several billion years</i>. They cover every inch of the earth, and compose large portions of the soil. As I type this, billions of bacteria are actively trying to digest me. It's no big deal. We grew up with this problem and have coped with it all our lives, as did our ancestors - and I'm not talking about our African ancestors, our shrewlike ancestors, or our fishlike ancestors, but about our <i>algal mat ancestors</i>. We've got a lot of experience, and the bacteria have even more. In a battle between a human-designed replicator and a cubic foot of soil bacteria, I'm going to bet on the machine that's had a longer design cycle.

4411475,comment,4407808,4409180,1,0,ryanmolden,,,"It is actually Anders Ericsson's[1] theory, popularized by Gladwell. Feel free to read Ericsson if you like, but he says basically the same thing, though neither he nor Gladwell ever said ""put in the 10,000 hours and you will be the Tiger Woods"". Ericsson has studied the realm of expert learning (for quite some time) and tries to tease apart what makes Tiger Woods, and those like him, able to attain the things they do. He has a lot of evidence that it is not some inborn talent but rather (shockingly) a shit-ton of hard work (and the quip ""You'll never be Tiger Woods because your dad wasn't Earl Woods""). The book Talent is Overrated[2] is also a decent read on the topic. It also tells the somewhat humorous story of Lszl Polgr[3], who wrote about how he was going to turn his yet to be born children into chess stars through rigorous training/practice, and then proceeded to do so.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Ericsson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Ericsson</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Talent-Overrated-World-Class-Performers-EverybodyElse/dp/1591842948/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1345531545&sr=8-1&keywords=talent+is+overrated"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Talent-Overrated-World-Class-Performer...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Polg%C3%A1r"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Polg%C3%A1r</a>",1345532328

I think what fundamentally bothers me about Vagrant is that it <i>feels like autoconf</i>. By that, I mean it's a system which 1) hides a ton of hard work that users don't need to do to target multiple backends 2) accomplishes that hiding through complexity 3) further hides that complexity through an ""easy"" interface 4) generally just fucking works most of the time 5) is completely maddening to deal with when it <i>does</i> break 6) ideally shouldn't need to exist.<p>Anyway, I realize that ideals != reality. I also realize that I've got a learned behavior of reinventing the minimal viable tool from fundamentals to avoid dealing with the complexity of problems that I don't have.

My google fu is not working for me, but I think it was to do with changing the approach. I've also heard of changing how you view yourself, imagining you already have the ability, ""what would X do?"" (Usain Bolt actually peaked and burned out when was younger, regained with a new coach, <i>less</i> training, and exercises to compensate for a congenital spine defect).  i.e. Also, while at a  plateau at one specific thing, there are many other things where effort still works (not overgeneralize from that one thing).  I'm also plateauing (at discrete mathematics), so I'm interested in the answer here.  Many creative people talk about leaving something that they are stuck at, and doing other things (perhaps a short break, perhaps for a long time) - then the answer (sometimes) comes to them, when they see with a new point of view.  Talking to people about it can help (even ""explaining to a duck"").<p>Of course, maybe there are attributes that we can't change, like height, that seem as insurmountable barrier.  While these may be a limitation in themselves, we may be able to work around them (e.g. professional basketball players under 6 foot <a href=""http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-shortest-nba-players.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-shortest-nba-players.php</a>).

I read up to the first example.<p>However, his clarification, and your proviso are also invalid.<p>First, your proviso, that it's non-assignable -- his type was <i>unusable</i>; that it's non-assignable simply seemed to be an error.  In C++ the default permissions for a class are private (not so in a struct, as I hinted at in my post, in fact, such is the only difference between a class and a struct in C++).<p>Now, onto his clarification:<p>The baked in assumption is that in a non-trivial C project that one would not be using a standard set of container abstractions as well.  Such is generally not the case.  See, for example, GList [1].  The replacement for a template based container in C++ is generally going to be a macro based container abstraction in C, whereas the replacement for a container of pointers in C++ is going to be a void * based generic container implementation (like GList) in C.  Both sets of generic implementations are going to have broadly the same performance characteristics (specifically, they're going to have the same number of mallocs of about the same size).<p>In both languages, if one needs specific performance characteristics -- specifically if mallocs are so critical that they must be restricted as much as possible -- one will use a special purpose data structure.  That however is a somewhat rare case for structs which are composed of non-POD types.<p>[1] <a href=""http://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.33/glib-Doubly-Linked-Lists.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.33/glib-Doubly-Linked-List...</a>",1346349509

The only times I hear of apps being rejected or pulled seem to in cases of trademark infringement; and, even-then, only if the infringed-upon company requests them to do so..<p>I saw this play-out with Vimeo apps not too long ago. Prior to the company launching their (really nice btw) official app there were a few a third-party clients which used the Vimeo name and logo; since then, they've all rebranded or disappeared (Im guessing at the request of Vimeo to avoid confusion).<p>Other than that, pretty much everything else seems to fly (Im guessing security issues and serious bugs that come-up during review aside). This is all anecdotal (I dont work at Microsoft or review apps for certification) but Id be pretty shocked if they blocked an app like this.<p>Anyways, it looks pretty cool, maybe if iOS certification doesnt go over the dev can port it to WP. For simpler apps (no offense here) Ive heard its fairly quick work and involves a lot less on the testing/optimizing for 1,000+ device SKUs (Android) front.",1346349497

Google gives a best guess as to what your demographics are based on other information they've collected about you.<p>The fact that its google's guess about demographics + only data from people actively seeking to avoid paying for premium content biases the results somewhat.  I'm not entirely clear what the premium content is, but if the content consistently appeals to one type of person over another, it would definitely be a source of bias.  Google's guess about your demographics probably just increases the error a little bit, but I'd be surprised if it consistently skewed the results in one direction or another.<p>So, not a perfect scientific survey, but miles above most web based surveys out there.<p>But intellectual concerns about accuracy aside, my initial emotional reaction is one of terror at google's apparent omniscience.

They'd make more money selling other information along side the emails.

Perhaps the poster child for such a business was the ""Pet rock"" business in the 70's where the 'product' was a rock in a nice package mocking practice of attempting to create a special identity around toys. It was also a fad, and came and went fairly quickly.<p>The thing about fashion is that its a perception thing and hard to control. And unfortunately technology has developed a wing in the fashion district.<p>So how does a fashion get 'launched' ? How does a certain look become 'the look' or a certain hairstyle become 'the hairstyle' ? The answer is that highly influential individuals endorse it through words or actions. The fashion designers know that the influencers in their sphere will have a huge impact on whether or not they are successful, so they court the influencers. the influencers get courted by everyone so they have high barriers to access.

So knowing someone who can get your product in front of, and used by, one of these key people can be the difference between nobody ever using your product and everyone using it. Simple example, take the top 100 people on Twitter and get them to move enmasse to identi.ca, their followers will follow to see where their influencers have gone, at that point identi.ca is a credible threat to Twitter's dominance.<p>The key is that there aren't any technical or product related challenges that identi.ca doesn't match, it's just not <i>fashionable</i>.",1346347155

It's about finding out what it is that they really need (not what they think they need, or what they want), and providing that to them first. Sometimes that does mean upselling them to a better system. Sometimes it means downselling them to a cheaper system with upgrades.

If a small percentage of the population owns most of the land and cuts down all the trees (for their sole profit), how is that no worse than you dumping toxic waste on ""my"" land?<p>Oddly libertarians consider free market principles as sacred, yet they do not realize that being able to pay a finite sum of money for an infinite amount of something (that is what owning land <i>in perpetuity</i> means) runs totally counter to free market principles. Just as there is a time value of money, there is a time value of capital. Owning land in perpetuity amounts to a free lunch to the land<i>lord</i>. They can charge rent and they and their line of heirs can live for free. Property tax and inheritance tax mitigates this problem (only partially at current levels), but populist libertarians are adamantly against these.<p>Please read up some on Georgism and Geoliberarianism. Understand why Jefferson is saying what he is saying.",1346346397

4455600,comment,4454840,4454840,2,0,Rorchackh,,,"Hey,<p>This is a very nice idea. I guess with the limitations you face in terms of teachers and principles not having access to your web platform, you can resort to doing things manually, but this is only feasible for a small number of students (and hence there is no need for cloud hosting at the points). AUI Professors might bug you about this during your presentation.<p>Suppose you already have a set of schools involved in your project. So you talk to the people managers and you decide to create an account for them in your platform (PS: AUI professors love the word platform. Abuse it). An easy way you can handle validating a student's work is to have the principle mail you the forms (nobody wants to do that). As an alternative, you can let them sign the usual documents, hand it to the student who then validates their own work online and uploads the scanned (pdf) version papers as proof. Note that nobody at AUI takes a look at those paper unless a student's work seems extremely suspicious when they're presenting it (and everyone has to presenting, so that adds a little bit of validation to the platform, though relying on this is merely avoiding the problem).<p>Another solution that seems interesting (at least to me) is give principles and teachers passwords that they can handing to students once they finish their work. Of course a password doesn't mean one simple word since students may share. it may be a hash of the students name/id, date of delivery and school's info (principles name or other info). Coming up with this password is the tricky part since it has to be easy enough for everybody to compute (no PC required), yet not obvious for student to understand. It should also be easy for you to compute based on information giving by the student and compare it to the one the sudden supposedly received from the principle.<p>Example (I gotta let my geek out a bit so here is an example in JSON):<p>{\n	id: 15383,\n	school: 23546,\n	date: '30/8/2012,\n	principle: '324324'\n}<p>===> just add all the freaking numbers ==> 365211 \n==> ask the student for this info when they're validating their work\n==> of course they don't know the principle's or the school's \nid so now way they can know how the output is generated.\n==> if they enter the right info, you compute. if it's good, they're validated. If not, send them an F*U message, although I don't think anyone will try to fool the system especially if you use their REAL AUI ids and the university fully endorses this project.<p>This is security by obscurity. You can think of something better.<p>Peace out.\nRorchackh",1346346384

He didn't wanted how skype and other icons looked in the notification are. His solution? Remove the system tray(notification area) and make impossible to use apps like instant messenger or amarok(I'm sure there must be a way, but not easy).<p>+ If you look at raster and e team screenshots you will find they use (and care)the terminal, gimp, inkscape a mIrc program and a memory mapper, so it's difficult for them to understand other people needs(not developers).<p>+ When compiz was introduced again raster thought it was not a good idea to include it. Other people included it, I don't know if raster dropping the link to elive(<a href=""http://www.elivecd.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elivecd.org/</a>) in his personal site have something to do with that.<p>+ Raster default widget theme was a little... how to say it?, I don't know if this is the word in english: tacky.",1258541875

If everyone has one, they lose their cachet.  Also, Android will probably never be quite as beautiful, but if you combine 'good enough' with a far more open system, and a platform that people can innovate on, I think that, long term, it will do quite well.<p>I sure hope so; I'm simply not interested in owning devices that I can't load my own code on, and that also require the ownership of a Mac just to develop on.",1258541116

I wonder if they will be as magnanimous as the author suspects or if they will simply be another tool of third world oppression. Like with how GMO crops sometimes have a built in dependency on a nutrition product sold by the same company, or how they can be made infirtile so the farmer cannot reseed the same crop.

There is no deadline, especially not in a market where people purchase new phones every 18-24 months.<p>I can see Android's sales continuing to trickle upward as prices drop on phone hardware, as companies use their brand loyalty to push Android phones on those upgrading, as new manufacturers enter the fray, and as the public are clearer about what 'Android' is.<p>I think people expected too much from Android on day one. Android's only been a multi-manufacturer platform for about 3 months and before then were only two rather clunky handsets which were both basically rush-released. It was never going to have the immediate impact that the iPhone had due to it being later to market, not having sales of the iPod to drive it forward, having less brand recongition and less marketing behind it.

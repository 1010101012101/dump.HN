2183,comment,1981,2026,0,0,lucks,,,"The screencast you posted was very nice, and very similar to the Turbogears screencast in spirit.  In fact both frameworks look very very similar from the screencasts, with the only differences being URL mapping, the syntax of the methods in the controller, and the templating language.  All of those I can adapt to.<p>What I am really curious about is a few features of Rails that were just stunning and made our life so much easier when making our prototype.  They were:<p>1.) Easy database migrations.<p>2.) The :AsTree and related specifiers in ActiveRecord that automatically creates utility methods for the object model (such as searching over parents/children of a record)<p>3.) Easy handling of session data<p>I haven't found any mention of these features in either Django or TurboGears and I haven't snooped enough yet to find them.  If you know if they are there, and how they are done, please let me know!",1173021390

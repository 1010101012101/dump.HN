The idea that credit scores can predict car accidents is ludicrous.  The author probably meant that credit scores can be used to predict claims on automobile insurance, but that, too, is just as incorrect.  Consider that many people with low credit scores are going to buy the least expensive vehicles and insurance they can find.  This means carrying liability-only coverage, which does not pay to the insured, just to anyone the insured might hit.  That means that the insurer is now using the credit score of the insured to ""predict"" the decision of a completely unknown third party who may or may not even exist.<p>Credit scoring, when used outside the context of granting credit (and, often, even in that context), is simply a way to continue to gouge people who have, for whatever reason, a damaged set of credit reports long after that damage has occurred.",1280260368

On one occasion when I thought the interview went great but wasn't hired, I sent a polite and well-phrased e-mail to the HR department.  It stated that I understand they didn't feel I was suited for the job, and that I was perfectly OK with that, but if they could provide me with a reason why it would aide me a lot in my job search.

1552475,comment,1550549,1552059,0,0,yafujifide,,,"> Thanks for the explanation. I think part of my confusion arises from the (apparently) mistaken idea that t=0 is equivalent to ""the first moment of time."" But it looks like t=0 is closer to ""before the first moment of time"". In a certain sense, that's a contradiction, because you can't have ""before"" time, but in another sense it's the only way to speak of that which (logically, not necessarily chronologically) precedes time.<p>Yes, I think that's right. It's more accurate to say that there was no first moment rather than that t=0 was the first moment. Reconciling that with the fact that time is nevertheless finite is an important part of understanding the big bang.<p>To put it mathematically, the set of points of time is open on the left end. The set of times is this: (0,\infty). And not this: [0,\infty)<p>Edit: By the way, when I say that time is ""finite"", I mean finite from now into the past. Not finite from ""start"" to ""finish"".

A repeatable deployment process that scales. Why did I pick chef over puppet or cfengine? Because I also wanted to learn ruby and the entire thing is in ruby, win. Plus we have a ruby on rails team in the office, if ever I needed a hand, they were there or if they wanted to write recipes to deploy software thats not an issue either.<p>DevOps is just a new buzz word. My title is System Administrator. I have a depth of knowledge in the infrastructure of all our technologies and how they are interconnected. I know how to deploy, maintain, scale and do it all over again. My knowledge in programming in second to that but is necessary to automate repetitive processes. DevOps I guess is being classed as a way to bring the IT team together, making sys admins and developers aware of each others ""agendas"" when it comes to running apps on servers. I as a sys admin have to understand what each of our applications does throughout its life cycle, from the browser right down to the database. Because if something goes wrong, I'll be the first to figure out where that happened and relay this back to the developer. By understanding core functionality of the code I can make it clear to the developer, ""look you are executing a query on the database thats scanning millions of rows because its not using an index, its occurring in this controller in your code"". We are seeing this term DevOps be classified now as more and more startups are emerging, because its essentially alot easier to execute in a startup environment where everyone is talking to each other to roll things out, everyone is trying to solve problems together. In large companies you'll see a massive separation and segregation along with processes to keep people in their place and slow results.<p>I hope that all makes sense.

I think we got into a dead-end with both proposed solutions having notable drawbacks.<p>The original sheet (read+write) was (and is still) prone to vandalism, which makes its content unreliable and fragile.
The second sheet (read only + form) I less editable, has no wiki-like features (discussion, correction of mistakes after original submit, etc.).
I think that the drawbacks of the original solutions justified the fork, but I do agree that forks are generaly a bad thing, mostly because of the dissolution of informations and energy that it implies.<p>To date, I think the best solution comes from the site
hackernewsers.com, the site is simple and straightforward, it addresses all the problems of the previous solutions, and adds some nice features (maps, classification of abilities [improvable], etc.).
I have not been in contact with the author(s) of the site, but I'm quite impressed by the speed at which they delivered this.<p>So after starting the migration of all country+city data from original sheet to the forked sheet, I stopped and I now think we should direct the people who use the sheets to this new website.

Now we're in the mindset of ""get it out there"" and will be pushing new features as quickly as we can.<p>Right now we're most focused on getting feedback. We aren't building this in a silo and want do our best at building out features users actually want vs what we think they want.

If you, as a consumer, support a method of advertising and want more companies to do it in the future, there are two main ways of encouraging it: writing a letter, or buying the product. Writing a letter and not buying the product encourages them, but doesn't factor into cost analyses; buying the product factors into cost analyses, and both writing a letter and buying the product (and mentioning that you bought it because of the advertisement in the letter) provides ammunition for anyone at the company who supports the advertising method.<p>It's like the people who spent upwards of $500 on the Humble Indie Bundle: providing positive feedback to encourage things like it to happen in the future.<p>Treating it as a donation doesn't make sense, of course, and I have to agree that advertisements shouldn't be considered art, except in the most dramatic examples.

That is, this is the kind of work which continues to bring me joy after 2 decades. Application development, on the other hand, despite an ability to code, does not.<p>CM tools (current and their predecessors like cfengine) as they tend to be implemented strike me as a way of avoiding administering the whole <i>system</i>, by focusing on a single component (servers) and reducing them to a lowest common denominator.<p>It also fits the pattern of trying to solve problems entirely in a custom software solution, a trait I associate with developers, not sysadmins.

There's the underlying hardware, the peripheral hardware like disks, database software[2], network hardware and configuration, and service providers.<p>These are all traditional sysadmin areas, with <i>plenty</i> of room for professional growth and overall benefit. So much so, that I have difficulty imagining why any SA (not a developer in SA's clothing) would wish to do more dev at the expense of increaaed mastery of the infrastructure.<p>By way of example, something I wrote on LinkedIn, in response to why I'm not a fan of puppet:<p><pre><code>  I'm uncomfortable with any system that attempts to maintain state in place

  That the client takes its own local file inventory on a fresh system, rather

  worse, to me, is that it creates yet another system to administer. I haven't yet 
  found anything similarly suitable for the Ubuntu/Debian world, but I very 
  much liked Cobbler a couple years ago, as it was primarily a wrapper for

  repo). Even without such a wrapper, yum/rpm or apt/dpkg can do nearly all

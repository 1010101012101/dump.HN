482236,comment,482116,482116,0,0,nickb,,,"<i>The problem is.... Google's Chrome for Windows doesn't look native.</i><p>And which app does? MS Office doesn't look native either. Neither does IE. In fact, very few MS apps actually use their guidelines and default widget sets. Office, for example, has a completely different widget set and even has a different toolbar (ribbon).... not to mention a completely different window chrome and that big round button in top left. And many other Windows apps don't follow the guidelines either.<p><i>A non-native UI that looks the same on Mac, Windows, and Linux would be the answer to such a browser OS. It would indicate that Chrome is its own product - from the codebase to the user experience - and that to the end user it shouldn't matter what OS you're on.</i><p>Except that people today do use different OSes and nativeness does matter! Inconveniencing and annoying your users with an intent to make them aware that your app is somehow different is opposite from what you should be doing: conforming to their learned patterns of how their UI works and making the transition to a new app painless and 'invisible.'<p>I'm in complete agreement with Goodger on this one: none of the cross platform widget sets feel native on any of the OSes. Firefox still feels awkward on OS X and has a lot of deficiencies in the way the text boxes work, keyboard navigation for assistive devices. In-browser widgets like buttons and drop-down menus are just off when you compare them with native widgets (drop-down in particular) and feel weird.<p>They invoke that 'the uncanny' feeling: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uncanny"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uncanny</a>  They look like the real thing but aren't and give you that uncomfortable feeling.",1234727822

If Google doesn't set that precedent, then its employees will be less worried if their projects haven't taken off.<p>It's also important not to kill ""most"" things, because people can only take so many failures.  The culture of innovation could die from attrition: how many times do you want to pour your heart and soul into things, only to see them die?  Hopefully Google doesn't cancel projects too often, and has a well established ""salvage"" operation for parts of old projects.",1234727685

I could make the exact same argument about accessibility ""such and such program has no support for accessibility and yet still sells really well, so why do we need accessibility?"" The idea is to provide quality beyond the minimum which is necessary to get you to use the thing.<p>If you could make a toolkit that was non-native, but behaved as if native on all its target platforms then obviously that would be key. Also, Chrome currently only officially exists for Windows, a platform whose users are less picky about native look and feel. You would probably have a harder time getting away with this on Mac OS X.

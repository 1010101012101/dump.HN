Also, while it&#x27;s all great the Syncthing tool is open source I see that they have precompiled binaries. Now I ask you, what percentage of people will compile themselves instead of downloading the readily available binary? <i>Especially</i> Windows users? In short, syncthing isn&#x27;t immune to the USgov/NSA. We&#x27;re talking about the general public; not just hardcore techies who can download & compile source code. I can just get GPG & rsync if I wanted... but that&#x27;s not the point. Me and the person I replied were talking about &quot;services&quot;(tech companies), not stand-alone tools.<p>Anyways, Syncthing doesn&#x27;t even replace Dropbox.  Syncing files is just one of Dropbox&#x27;s several features. And without a 3rd-party central server, Syncthing won&#x27;t be able to deal with the person who wants their work computer to sync with their home computer.

This is less effort on my part (prep, cleanup, etc...).  When people do come around I don&#x27;t care what they think beyond hoping it&#x27;s not, &quot;Wow what a filthy pig.&quot;<p>I do however have granite counter tops.  The up front cost is more, but I&#x27;m a stayer, not a mover.  My long term cost is less. The counter tops were installed 7 years ago and they look exactly the same today as they did when I moved in. When I die or get sent to the old folks home (hopefully not for another 50+ years) those counters will still be there and look just as good as they do today.<p>In the long run this is less money and less time and effort since I don&#x27;t need someone replacing my laminate counter tops every 10 years. They also withstand high temperatures and are more sanitary since they are sealed and don&#x27;t break down over time (dents, dings, scratches like laminate).<p>If you were to see my house, what you would find is that it is very plain, but that things inside of it are meant to last.<p>When I moved in the upstairs flooring was carpet; it was in bad shape; stains, discolored, but I waited 5 years to replace it because I&#x27;m cheap.  When I did replace it I bought solid wood; I got a finish that was on clearance because it was discontinued.  Like the counters, the floor will last the rest of my lifetime, worst case scenario I will have to pay to have it resurfaced once in my entire life span.  This is much cheaper than carpet over the long run.<p>My basement is still carpeting; when I purchased the home the basement carpet was stained so badly and stank so badly of dog urine that it had to be replaced immediately.  I was broke from all of the cost of purchasing the home so I had the absolute cheapest carpet installed and it is still there more than 10 years later in bad need of replacement again.  When I do replace it, probably next year, I will put in a life time durable tile and be done with it FOREVER.",1413078197

Information shall be considered as &quot;collected&quot; only when it has been received for use by an employee of a DoD intelligence component in the course of his official duties. Thus, information volunteered to a DoD intelligence component by a cooperating source would be &quot;collected&quot; under this procedure when an employee of such component officially accepts, in some manner, such information for use within that component.

The &quot;read by a human definition&quot; as far as I can tell comes from the EFF selectively quoting that definition[2] and drawing their own conclusions from their selective quotation, not the regulation itself.

I knew every piece of server hardware in every datacenter, and what services ran on them. It was my job to qualify and deploy hardware, do the systems level automation, and run the user facing frontends. There is literally no way that something like PRISM could be put in place without my knowledge except by what would amount to sabotage.<p>Keep in mind that while Dropbox is large for a startup, it only recently surpassed 1,000 employees (150 when I joined). The vast majority of those people are in customer service, and the number of people with access to production is likely still well under 100. For the first five years of the company&#x27;s life there was one datacenter manager and network engineer (the same person), one SRE up until I was hired, and so on. In operations, we did more with less.<p>However, this shouldn&#x27;t make you feel like your data in Dropbox is guaranteed to be safe from prying government eyes.

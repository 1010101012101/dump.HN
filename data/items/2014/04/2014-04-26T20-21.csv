That risk can be managed to a degree with many layers of programmatic safeties, and other practices like having your operations people look for warning emails the day after you&#x27;ve deployed new code. But the risk is always present.<p>- &quot;It makes the market more unstable.&quot; The most important market-maker in U.S. equities blew itself up in spectacular fashion and had to remove itself from the trading entirely. Sending unaccounted orders into the market in an endless loop is about the worst mistake an algorithmic trading firm can make.

There you have the Cold War angst, the fear and uncertainty we all were brought up with, which now has vanished like a nightmare, but it&#x27;s still lurking inside. The technology in the post-apocalyptic World of Oo (delicious names) shows tokens of that age, BMO is a Mac, there are VHS tapes and CRT TVs, everything is old but has that timeless charm of the things you learnt first. And there is so much Sesame Street vibe deep down there, we were really educated by it. It&#x27;s a love song from grown up kids to grown up kids. An uncertain world, full of charm and hidden dangers with pure heroes that make mistakes and surprising foes that have their adult reasons.<p>Just a quote. Episode &quot;Beyond this Earthly Realm&quot;, Ice King is watching static on TV (how cool this was?), he can alter it because of his ghostly condition in that scene, and then he comes up with this:<p>âWhat do you think, Finn?

The type system is mediocre, generic support is bad (you have to use interface{}, which is like casting to Object in Java or passing structs/objects around as void*s in C/C++), the language relies heavily on non-extensible built-in constructs like range and make(), etc. I use Go a lot, and I like it for building web services, but I really don&#x27;t see the advantage for anything else.<p>Rust, on the other hand, takes a lot of cues from Haskell/ML and is actually a very well designed language with lots of cool features like a hindley-milner based type system with strong generic support, pattern matching, strong support for immutable and functional programming styles, etc.",1398543994

Basicaly the upkeep became a problem when servants became too expensive.<p>That kind of thing--ie, a form of economic infeasibility--is what people are facing.

If you&#x27;re writing another web app, then sure, you don&#x27;t care about stack vs heap. If you&#x27;re writing performance oriented code, then you do. Both D and C# allow for a similar mechanism<p>Some languages do that for you. Allocating on the stack by default and falling back to the heap when it wouldn&#x27;t be safe to allocate on the stack. e.g. if the object can outlive the current function call, it shouldn&#x27;t be allocated on the stack.<p>If the Rust compiled doesn&#x27;t known how to spot unsafe stack allocations, then you don&#x27;t have memory safety.<p>> > Copy traits feel a lot like C++ copy constructor (a.k.a.

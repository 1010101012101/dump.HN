The main site runs Rails 3RC, and any requests begin with /blog will get proxied over to the WordPress site running locally.<p>Basically I have Apache running on port 81 locally, and I setup the WordPress to a ""blog"" folder underneath the DocumentRoot.<p>Then within the server { } configure block in nginx, I have<p>server {

}<p>You will have to update the WordPress config to tell that it's installed in a sub folder and not at the root.  It took me a while to figure out (all other articles online will tell you to update the wp-config.php file to define the different constants, but it's not the right spot for WordPress 3).  You'd have to update the wp_options table as well to fix the path.

1570176,comment,1564680,1569608,0,0,AgentConundrum,,,"2 and 3 seem relatively obvious to me. The mailing list part of 3 was new to me, as I wasn't really aware they existed, but keeping things up to date and upgrading when they're not seemed pretty common sensey.<p>Regarding #1 though: How do I know what I can and can't turn off? Obviously turning off Apache or something like that is wrong, but there could be less obvious things I may miss.<p>For the things that need to stay on (and I'm mainly focusing on the AMP in LAMP with this), are they generally good-to-go out of the box with minimal ""extraordinary"" configuration, or are there good resources to securing them that I should be reading? I guess what I'm asking is, beyond following the slicehost/linode tutorials, how much do I really need to know and where can I find it.<p>Beyond all of this, I'll address your first point regarding the inherent incomplete security of things: While you can't make anything 100% secure, you should still try your best to prove that statement wrong. Plugging all ""known"" holes in your security is still a lot better than being ignorant of them.",1280811537

If it is unfriendly to engineers, then it is unfriendly to everyone.<p>Some points here:<p>The key point that starts off #1 is more or less a side effect of any company where you hire folks who have a need for stability in their life. The unpredictability that he refers to is little different than how startups need to pivot. The only difference is that at a big company, it's management's job to hide that from the masses, and there's a limit to how well that can be handled.<p>Now as startup folks, you may find this abhorrent, or as big-company peons, you may still find this abhorrent, but all the organizations I've seen, from 200-man high school volunteer clubs all the way up to multi-billion dollar corporations, all of them have to deal with this. It's just that a tiny startup where people feel like they're on the same boat and have the emotional fortitude to handle it, then it may be better to be direct and honest.<p>The no-interviews bit is mildly troubling, but every engineer who's thought about company culture has probably come to this question eventually: if it's not to one's own benefit to interview engineers, then doesn't it seem likely that interviews would devolve into intellectual hazing sessions?<p>Points #3 and #4 are typical at any company larger than about one or two hundred. My hypothesis is that once you have more than 3 layers of management, the folks at the top who've been there and know what they're doing can't help your direct manager when he needs it. And again, as I see it, this is little different from how startup folks have to go through the process of finding the right company, the right founding team, and so on. People want to go to a big company and think that it will suddenly all be magical but of course there is no shortcut for the biggest challenges in life.",1280810857

1570142,comment,1570139,1570139,0,0,lunchbox,,,"As promised in my post:<p><i>Most common tricks used in ""The Real Hustle"":</i><p>1. Fake an appearance of authority (wear a uniform, get a sign, etc.)<p>2. Get a shill/accomplice.<p>3. Get people to make exceptions to routine security measures based on extenuating circumstances.<p>4. Get people distracted or nervous<p>5. Use social conditioning to prevent people from speaking out (e.g. taboos against making a scene in public)<p>6. Appear to concede something of your own (give someone fake collateral)<p>7. Give the mark a motive to be surreptitious (e.g. get the mark to commit a crime)<p>8. Make people think there's an information asymmetry to their advantage (e.g. pretend not to know how much Euros are worth, thus making the person think they're ripping YOU off)<p>9. Put the mark under time pressure.<p>10. Use easily obtainable information for authentication. (e.g. eavesdrop on the person)<p>11. Do a verification of authenticity, but then cause an interruption that lets you swap back to counterfeit. (e.g. show someone the laptop you're selling them, but at the last moment swap it out of the bag for a block of wood)<p>12. Cause a plausible emergency situation that voids the usual authentication mechanisms. For example, put an ""out of order"" sign on a bank deposit box and stand to collect people's money.<p>13. Fake credible signals. For example, people are willing to believe what they overhear while eavesdropping on you,  since they don't realize they've been set up, and therefore don't think you have any reason to be dishonest.<p>14. To increase trust, give the mark a token sign that you're following security guidelines: ""sorry, I'm not allowed to accept money from you. Please call this number instead.""<p>15. Make an offer you know they'll refuse, but that enhances your credibility nonetheless. (e.g. offer to authenticate yourself in a way that would inconvenience them, such as having them call a number and wait on the line.)<p>16. Stores/restaurants don't let you leave without paying, but they're more comfortable if someone in your party sticks around. Befriend an innocent bystander and make them complicit by giving the business the impression that you know the person.<p><i>Protecting against scams:</i><p>1. Always keep your valuables in a hard-to-reach location<p>2. Require credible authentication! If someone calls, ask for a number to call them back.<p>3. If you can't get credible authentication, take a picture. Get the conman's identity. They should be happy to give you more info. Or put them in a surprise situation that will throw their scam off guard.<p>4. For a game or proposition bet: ask ""Is there a trick?""<p>5. If an out-of-the-ordinary event happens and you get your attention drawn to something, keep in mind that it could be a scam.<p>6. Bargains rarely come looking for you, unless there's a catch.<p>7.

When I asked him why, he said they did not want to dip into their savings for daily expenses and wanted to have a business that was sure to make them just enough money without way too much effort. I think this is not a bad strategy unless you just don't want to work, which I think is rare.<p>In terms of growth, I think its wiser to invest in BRIC where the core domestic markets are getting stronger and the stock market returns are a lot better, though choppy. Also if you diversify into real estate (recurring income), CDs (monthly income), and such other opportunities, then you can strike a balance for yourself.<p>Influence is VERY tough though. I wouldn't count on it as an indefinite opportunity to earn money when needed, assuming you are able to cut through the noise and build credibility (which itself may be tougher than having a decent exit. Plus it is not for everyone). New influencers constantly displace current influencers and it would take a lot more work to maintain it unless you founded Google or something.",1280810151

If I'm manufacturing a widget my fixed costs aggregate over all widgets produced. A prototype is extremely expensive. The first 10 million are much cheaper. The next 90 million are even cheaper than that. Yes the benefits get less drastic on a per unit basis, but the total savings for that last 90 million could still be extremely significant.

7881746,comment,7879756,7881271,6,0,soapdog,,,"I could write a whole essay on this topic, believe me... so lets go with the short version.<p>First is that most of the phones out there are running Firefox OS 1.1 and this version is not as snappy as Firefox OS 1.3 which is probably the next version those phones will upgrade to. Firefox OS 1.3 is much faster and solved a lot of bugs.<p>HTML5 is the native thing in Firefox OS. All apps and parts of the system itself are built with it. Thats how good it is when we build Telephony stuff in Javascript.<p>The thing is that Firefox OS is also the easiest platform to develop for. Its much easier to develop for web technologies than it is to learn ObjC and Java. That being said, lots of new developers are coming on board are still learning the best practices so we see a lot of apps that could be better just like you see a lot of pages that could be better on the web.<p>The Gecko engine and its WebAPI provide the developer with all that is needed to create good quality apps but since this is our first year, some of our third party developers are still learning the trade. Its getting a lot better.<p>There are 8 million web developers in the world. They could all be shipping apps on Firefox OS if they wanted to. Its free and we provide all the docs, also, its quite easy to develop for Firefox OS first and then pass thru Cordova or similar tech and deploy on other platforms.<p>We believe that the web will win in the long run and that a &quot;web first&quot; mentality will emerge where people will opt to go with an HTML5 solution instead of ObjC/Java/C# threesome.<p>I invite you all to explore our rich APIs at <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI</a> and see how every time we feel that something can&#x27;t be done in HTML5 we try to come with a proposed standard. Its this type of evolution of web standards that moves the web forward in all platforms such as desktops, laptops, TVs and more.<p>As for used cellphones being sold, that doesn&#x27;t really count in the larger scheme of things. Specially when dealing with Apple. As an exercise try picking an iPhone 3GS and installing random stuff from the App Store... its very hard because developers in those platforms are always developing for the new shiny and forget old customers with outdated hardware very easily. Now try installing an old web browser, something like the same Firefox that was available at that time and browsing the web. It will work because thats how web stuff is made, its made to keep working or degrade nicely. This means that what we call &quot;open web apps&quot; not only are easier to build but they can be used by more people with different hardware and thats why we have the world wide web and not some strange silo such as compuserve...<p>Think of yourself in five years: What type of world do you want? A world where web standards and engines have evolved to the point where you can do all you wish as a developer without moving away from web technologies and you&#x27;re free to run your app in different platforms and systems or a world where you need to ask &quot;pretty please&quot; to a company in the north region of california every time you want to ship an app?<p>Sorry for making this long...",1402545453

FxOS (an it&#x27;s app ecosystem) is still <i>very</i> young (1.3 just came out, and the first release came out at the end of 2012). I&#x27;m positive that we&#x27;ll continue to see dramatic performance improvements as well as feature parity with the dominant platforms, along with the app ecosystem continuing to mature.<p>On the app developer side, making apps requires no specialized development environments or knowing anything beyond web technologies (HTML/JS/CSS), which dramatically lowers the bar for making apps.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what counts as &quot;truly remarkable&quot;, personally I am pretty impressed by games like Cut the Rope on my FirefoxOS phone. I also carry and regularly use an outdated Android device that has very similar specs, and  it&#x27;s not particularly responsive.

Even if you assume a salary of $150,000/year, in order to reach $300,000/year you would need to make $150,000/year in stock options, which comes out to $450,000 total if you assume it takes 3 years to get from series B+ to an acquisition/IPO. Of course, it could take longer. Or the median outcome could occur and neither event would happen.<p>So even in the unlikely scenario that the company goes from series B -> liquidation event in 3 years, and you get 0.25% equity (I&#x27;m assuming unreasonably generous stock options here for your average engineer, especially given the base salary), the company needs a $180MM liquidation event for the math to work out. This of course assumes that all stock is equal and your investors don&#x27;t have a liquidation preference or anything like that.

I believe profoundly on it&#x27;s power partly because it&#x27;s the only way I can really get things done properly, which is why those tools resonate so much to me. I have a friend however that shudders every time I mention making programming more visual.<p>I mean, If I&#x27;m not visualizing something, I can perhaps find some solution in a logical way following some guidelines -- much like following a recipe to solve a equation or doing trial an error to solve an algebraic problem. But critically, I can&#x27;t <i>create</i> this way. I may <i>stumble</i> unto something useful, but it&#x27;s an entirely different process from creativity -- it&#x27;s efficiency is so much lower that it&#x27;s qualitatively different.<p>But my difficulty at that is not fundamental, I think. I <i>believe</i> you can be creative purely &#x27;algebraically&#x27;, but I have no experience with it -- but I do believe that some people have the same efficiency that I have when I think visually and perhaps stumble a little more when trying to visualize things themselves.<p>I do think this diversity is quite good, but that&#x27;s missing the point. My point is that Bret&#x27;s tools shouldn&#x27;t be universally <i>essential</i>, but are probably universally beneficial. And for some people, like me, they&#x27;d be simply  enabling.<p>To give an exaple: when I see a system of linear equations, I don&#x27;t think of a bunch of steps to solve them and the number of cases that the solutions may look like in terms of constraints of variables an so on. I think of the Image hyperplane, which can be abstracted as a plane in 3D, and the Kernel, which may be for example a line not on the Image. Then instead I wonder if the Kernel is non-null, what funny things this matrix is doing to the vectors (are they rotating, contracting, and so on), or what are the invariant subspaces. I can answer most questions one could ask about such system, but it&#x27;s a distinct way, I&#x27;m not sure if more efficient or not (and that may be up to the task).",1402543839

Browsing it can be very interesting and often quite amusing.<p>The entry for California (nowadays „Kalifornien“ in German, but „California“ in the encyclopaedia) is actually pretty long, somewhat hilarious and somewhat sad. On the issue of whether California is an island it teaches the controversy and presents both viewpoints, though clearly seems to prefer the view that California is an island.<p>I will try to translate the entry quite literally (paragraph breaks are inserted for better readability):<p>“California, also called Noua Albion [sic, should probably be Nova Albion?], an island in northern America, situated in the South Sea, reaches to New Mexico or New Granada, and is separated from them by a sea arm; however, many believe it to only be a peninsula that is connected to the mainland towards the north. In length it measures 600 or 700 French miles from north to south, from the capes Cabo blanc, Cabo S. Sebastian and Cabo Mendocino to the Cabo de S. Lucar.<p>The inhabitants are upstanding people, the men walk naked, the women, however, are covered to the knees in skins or feathers from the birds. The people are very skilled in hunting and fishing, as they have a special way of catching the fish.<p>The land is arid, barren and cold [huh?], even though it is situated where it should rather be hot or at least temperate. There are frequently grasshoppers. Pearls are found eastward on the coasts of California, just as on the coasts of New Mexico and New Granada, as first discovered by Cortesio [Hernán Cortés, I assume] in the year 1535.”<p>There is also an entry in a supplement volume that expands on the pearl fishing:<p>“California, island, [reference to previous volume]. Because the coasts there are famous for pearl fishing, the Europeans strongly wished to be there, and also, from time to time, attempted to remain there. In the beginning of the year 1703 a fortress was already built there [I wonder which fortress that is and whether it still exists in some form], so that it can serve to protect the Spaniards in an emergency. It stands in the quarter [not sure about this one, both in the German original and the translation] St Dionysii, on land that the Indians [„Indianer” in the original] call Coneho [Conejo?].

Parasitic capacitance (and inductance) exist between any two objects because the electric (and magnetic) field extend from a charge (or current) to infinity.  These fields store energy, even in perfect vacuum.  The lumped circuit model of stored electric energy is capacitance, the model of stored magnetic energy is inductance so anything physical which carries charge or current will have capacitance or inductance (will store finite energy).

Carpooling increases liability risk. You get in a wreck with a fare or three in your little sedan and you could be looking at a massive increase in payouts for that driver&#x27;s bad luck. That you are trying to maximize your utilization and occupancy means you are not enabling the insurance company to assess (and price) your risk appropriately. Their service is priced based on your honest divulging (and their industry resourced info) of driving habits. There are assumptions of number of riders for commuter miles.<p>So, they could deny coverage based on the details of your policy and the facts of the situation. Read carefully. Interpret broadly. When investigating the claims, they will inquire about the affiliations of the riders in the vehicle. I can imagine an Uber driver, with their riders holding their necks, running around saying, &quot;When you talk to my insurance adjuster about this, I need you to lie or we all get nothing.&quot;<p>That would then be insurance fraud at a whole other level.<p>Insurance companies have been at policy fraud and claim denial for as long as auto insurance has been available.<p>Given odd situations with large payouts at stake, we&#x27;ll be reading about subpoenas for user info from Uber or telecoms at some point. The meta-data of your fare(s) could be pretty damning.<p>Uber seems that it is not being responsible to its drivers or customers in this regard.

In every case I&#x27;ve been up to speed in a reasonable time - sure I might not be the world&#x27;s expert but Good Enough.

Therefore, miners have a self-interest to protect the integrity of the network.  It isn&#x27;t like there are no alternatives to Ghash.io.  It looks they collectively voted that this wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal, or it would get sorted out by other mechanics (like this), and they were right.

Three years ago I moved to Paraguay, where I currently live.<p>What has your experience been?\n- Mixed. There are good things and bad things. But, overall, I&#x27;m happier here and plan to stay.<p>What is your particular career?\n- .Net back-end programmer, back in the US. However, I&#x27;m trying to do other IT-related things here that don&#x27;t involve me sitting in someone&#x27;s cubicle for eight hours a day.<p>What were your moving expenses?\n- Just the price of the plane ticket. I sold everything, packed a few bags, and left.<p>How much is your rent or did you buy?\n- I&#x27;m renting a tiny apartment in one of the nicer neighborhoods in Asuncion for about $300/month. I highly recommend that you don&#x27;t buy until after you&#x27;ve lived in a place for at least a year. It will take you that long to see if you really want to stay there, and also figure out the local real estate market.<p>Where did you move to/from?\n- US. Chicago and Texas.<p>How are the schools?\n- I don&#x27;t have any kids, but I&#x27;ve heard that you&#x27;d probably want to send your kids to private schools here.<p>Have you become fluent in the native language and was the language barrier difficult to overcome?\n- I&#x27;ve become a little bit better than &quot;functional&quot;, but nowhere near fluent. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s easy to get lazy at this point. You&#x27;d generally need to be close to fluent in Spanish, to get anything done here. However, since I mostly hang out with Paraguayans who are educated IT people, many who have learned English. Since they&#x27;re usually better at English than I am at Spanish, we often end up speaking in English.<p>How long have you lived in this country? Are you a permanent resident or do you plan on moving back to the US?\n- Just over three years here. I&#x27;ve had permanent residency for two and a half years. I plan to apply for Paraguayan citizenship at the end of this year (when I&#x27;ll first be eligible). I don&#x27;t plan to return to the US.<p>What was the process like to become a permanent resident?\n- Fairly easy. Get some documents from the US (birth certificate, police background check, etc.), have them legalized by the Paraguayan Embassy/Consulate in the US, deposit $5000 in a local bank (to prove financial solvency), and hire a local &quot;gestor&quot; for about $800 to deal with getting the paperwork stamped and submitted, dragging me around to the required appointments, etc. Six months later, I have my permanent residency and applied for my &quot;cedula&quot; (national ID), which took about a month to receive.<p>Did you have to already have a job when you moved to that country?\n- Nope. But I had a decent amount of savings (emphasis on &quot;had&quot;).<p>What&#x27;s the cost of living compared to where you moved from? Has your quality of life improved or not? How and why?\n- I live on around $1000 a month. I could live cheaper if I cooked at home more often. I could live more expensively, if I rented a bigger/nicer home. Overall, I&#x27;d say my life is better - even when you include the stress of still trying to get some business idea to work. I lost about 25 pounds of excess weight, from eating better and walking more.

And YES, this part is insufferable. I found that dialogs between Harry and McGonagall were specially awful since those pushed me out of suspension of disbelief almost on a sentence by sentence basis.<p>The history however gets better, at least in the sense that the author stops preaching through the main characters and begins to actually write a story. There are multiple ways this story may offend a portion of its readers, so it is not for every one, but strictly speaking the flow gets better after the first few chapters.<p>Without giving spoilers away, some of the things that tend to annoy people the most are:<p>* Whether the main character (Harry) is a mary sue or not.<p>* The promotion or demotion of certain support characters in comparison with the canon.<p>* The value system of the author, which keeps leaking through the whole story and may touch one sensible fiber or another from time to time.<p>Personally, these issues do not bother me a lot.

As a kid I lived in Germany for a few years, but this is my first time living abroad since. There are pros and cons with every place. No place is perfect. Living abroad you’ll learn to appreciate the positives you can enjoy in each place.<p>>What is your particular career?\nMechanical Engineer<p>>What were your moving expenses?\nSingle 1 way ticket - $1000 - $1500\nVisa - $1500 deposit (refundable on return…. Fingers crossed)\nEverything I brought fit in two suitcases. Import taxes are high…<p>>How much is your rent or did you buy?\nI pay $350 a month to share a three bedroom, 1.5 bath town home with two others. Water is included. Electricity is slightly higher per kwhr when compared to the states.<p>>Where did you move to/from?\nFrom Colorado to Cape Town<p>>How are the schools?\nYou get world class private schools to third world public education. A lot of the schools are a mix of public/private entities. Similar grade system to USA. Can’t really talk about this though, don’t have any youngsters…<p>>Have you become fluent in the native language and was the language barrier difficult to overcome?\nEnglish is common, but learning one of the local languages would be a fun task. The Afrikaans language is similar to Dutch. The native African languages would be more challenging to learn coming from English.<p>>How long have you lived in this country? Are you a permanent resident or do you plan on moving back to the US?\nI’ve been living here since January. My visa is temporary, 2 years. Not sure what will happen or where I will go next.<p>>What was the process like to become a permanent resident?\nN/A… But the visa process not fun, lots of documents, medical records, and the return envelope I sent went missing which delayed things further.<p>>Did you have to already have a job when you moved to that country?\nN/A… Although I would say that I already had a connection here. Moving to a new place one way ticket style without visiting or talking to anybody may be a bit more exciting.<p>>What&#x27;s the cost of living compared to where you moved from? Has your quality of life improved or not? How and why?\nThe cost of living here is cheaper. Quality food and eating out is cheaper. McDonalds prices and Burger king prices are similar to back home, and taste the same surprisingly… I’m definitely earing less money now than I did in the states. In general basic necessitates are cheaper, but luxuries are more expensive including cars, electronics, bicycles, etc.",1405702150

If everyone was using their network connection at max capacity 24/7 there would be network congestion issues.<p>No, not necessarily.  That&#x27;s how Verizon Residential chose to build out their network but that&#x27;s not the only way to do so.  The commercial side of Verizon manages to provide their customers with 100% of SLA throughput 24/7 no problems.  Technically this is feasible.<p>I would agree that I might not be able to get 100% utilization at the price I am currently paying.  That is a point I will concede.  BUT, SOMEHOW Google Fiber in three cities and Chattanooga is also supplying gigabit fiber.  And they&#x27;re not charging $10k/mo per person to do so.  Could everyone use the full gigabit connection 24/7?  I seriously doubt it.  But if they&#x27;re oversubscribed by 10x on gigabit and other places are oversubscribed by 10x on 100 Mbps then they are successfully delivering 10x the internet for the same price, or perhaps 50%-100% more.  It&#x27;s not linear that&#x27;s for sure.<p>For your argument to hold water if Google Fiber was 10x faster than Verizon, then Google Fiber would also have to be 10x as oversubscribed as Verizon.  I very, very seriously doubt that this is the case.<p>> Thus the arguments that &quot;I&#x27;ve been sold 50Mbps/down I should be able to use it at max capacity 24/7&quot; without issue are incorrect.<p>This is a straw man argument.  You are not engaging in an honest dialog.  You seem to be purposefully obtuse.  People watching Netflix in NO WAY constitutes 100%, 24/7 utilization!<p>How about &quot;I&#x27;ve been sold 50 Mbps service and I want to use 3 Mbps of it for an average of 3 hours per day, which is a measly 6% of the advertised speed and is only 12.5% of the 24/7&quot;<p>There are two ways to do the math here.  One is based on peak utilization, where we assume that everyone watches Netflix at the same time, 100% identically, say from 6pm-9pm.  In that case Verizon can be over-subscribed by a factor of roughly 16x (50Mbps/3Mbps) and still keep their customers happy.<p>The other is to assume that everyone watches Netflix perfectly randomly.  In that case let&#x27;s assume 3 hours per day.  Here Verizon can be over-subscribed first by the 16x (since people don&#x27;t use all 50 Mbps) and further by another 8x (since people are using the service for 3/24 hours per day).  That gives you an over-subscribed factor of 128x.<p>The truth of course would lie somewhere in between 16x and 128x.  But what we&#x27;re seeing is that Verizon is over-subscribed by a factor of more than 16x otherwise people wouldn&#x27;t have any problems watching Netflix.  Put as percentages instead of ratios, customers are asking Verizon to provide between 0.75% and 6% of what they promised to deliver, and Verizon is refusing to do even that.<p>Further we have evidence via a blog post from Verizon that their entire network is NOT oversubscribed by a factor of 16x as it&#x27;s only at 40-60% utilization.  What is happening is that Verizon is throttling their users at the peering point.  It&#x27;s a great gig if you don&#x27;t get caught.  <a href=""http://publicpolicy.verizon.com/blog/entry/why-is-netflix-buffering-dispelling-the-congestion-myth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://publicpolicy.verizon.com/blog/entry/why-is-netflix-bu...</a><p>If we assume that 100% of all traffic on Verizon&#x27;s network is from Netflix that means Verizon could double the peering bandwidth to L3 before their network got congested.  Is that a valid assumption?  I don&#x27;t know, but I sincerely doubt it&#x27;s 100%.  During peak hours it might make up 50%.  In that case doubling the peering bandwidth would increase utilization from roughly 50% to roughly 75% which is perfectly acceptable.<p>It must take some pretty fantastic mental gymnastics to convince yourself that a provider who is not able to make good on 6% end-user utilization is totally in the right and their upset customers are irrational and wrong.",1405702033

The last time I seriously tried to learn a foreign language was Spanish in high school and it was quite a debacle. But after many years married to a Korean woman, I finally decided I was embarrassed enough not knowing more than a few utility words in Korean to take the plunge.<p>I remember looking into learning Korean about 6 or 7 years ago and there really weren&#x27;t many on-line self-study resources and very few classes I could take. This time I found an virtual explosion of resources, free text books, skype practice sessions, listening guides, vocabulary resources, etc. For more popular languages, like French, the number of resources is almost mindboggling.<p>I&#x27;ve decided to focus the beginning of my studies on raw vocabulary acquisition and I&#x27;ve settled on using Anki to do this. My friends know that I have a pretty bad memory, so I&#x27;ve been shocked and surprised at how well Anki has worked. In 4 weeks I&#x27;ve managed to memorize (to different degrees of recall) about 300 words (out of a list of the 1000 most common).<p>Last week I sat down to start my grammar lessons with a free university textbook and was even more shocked and surprised at how much of the text I was able to decode. I wouldn&#x27;t call it comprehension exactly, but maybe 20-40% of the beginner-level sentences I could read well enough to get the gist without knowing any grammar. I checked ahead into later chapters and was amazed that I was still able to work out some non-negligible percent of most of the lessons.<p>For practice I watched a couple Korean tv shows (they love to put subtitles under everything which is helpful) and was also surprised that I could work out some bits of the nightly news. Not enough to really know what was going on, but within a month going from knowing basic foods and the word &quot;bathroom&quot; to starting some minimal comprehension felt pretty remarkable.<p>More recently I&#x27;ve been practicing language production and took the attitude the article advocates -- just focus on getting the point across, don&#x27;t worry about all the grammar bits. So, when something my wife and I are doing involves some vocabulary I remember, I try to formulate a basic sentence around it. I know I&#x27;m missing some things, but I told my wife to just grade me on &quot;is it understandable or not?&quot; not on &quot;is it correct or not?&quot;. It&#x27;s eased up the pressure quite a bit.<p>More importantly, even if my little experiment fails in the end. Outside of language study, I feel much more...&quot;engaged&quot; all the time. Like my brain is turned up a little. I&#x27;m finding my memory is definitely improving and some mental tasks that were starting to become harder as I&#x27;ve aged have started to become easier.<p>It&#x27;s actually kind of cool.",1405701873

To me drm hasnt been an issue for quite a few years.. I think it was with the last game I bought a hardcopy of. If you are talking about the gaming services everyone has different views on different vendors. It can be argued that the need for the console itself, created by a single manufacturer with sole control, is drm in itself.<p>* No viruses or malware to worry about<p>If you dont click suspicious banners or run spam executables you wont run into viruses (If you are a legit customer, if you download from piratebay or similar you can only blame yourself). I have been an active gamer most of my life (31 years old now) and I think I ran into my last virus back in windows xp.<p>* Far fewer updates to install and in general less maintenance<p>So you live with bugs for longer? Must suck... The awesome thing about pc gaming is that whenever you log on some issue you had in the past might be gone. Updates are there to improve your gaming. If you are talking about your OS, you forget that your computer is not just a game station, it is also a tool. The updates are there to keep things running smoothly.<p>* Warranty - if I build a PC myself and it breaks, I need to fix it (I recognise that for more technical users and/or people with more time, it&#x27;s a plus that you can fix a PC yourself - but that isn&#x27;t everyone)<p>If it breaks, call a repair guy. I refer again to my point about the computer not being a dedicated gaming platform.<p>* Compatibility. It&#x27;s hardly rare to run into issues if you try to play a PC game on launch date, and often graphics card driver updates fix some games and break others.<p>What does launch day have to do with compatibility? I have never suffered not having up to date drivers if a high profile game using some weird functions not covered by previous drivers is about to be released. Again, I am an avid computer gamer.<p>* Noise and size (it&#x27;s hard to make a small quiet and powerful PC on a budget)<p>No its not. Have you tried? It is cheaper to make a powerful and noisy computer, but silence is not super pricey, ya see. Your little console is partly built with pc components, so you should be able to create an equally powerful machine with the same noise level for just about the same price.<p>* Peripherals - there is a standardized set that &quot;just works&quot; for a console. On the PC, maybe half of my Steam library supports my controller out of the box.<p>Not every game uses a kinekt. Not every game uses a joystick. I have a pretty beat up x-box clone gamepad, a cheap joystick and a track ir at home. Never had any issues with them. For most games I prefer the keyboard tho so this might be a bigger issue for others.<p>And one non-technical aspect which isn&#x27;t a concern for everyone, but is for many:\n* My friends are all on [XBox Live|PSN] and I want to play with them<p>And there we get to the meat and potatoes of your post. You game with your friends, all your friends are on other platforms, so you do as well. That is fine. There is nothing wrong with it. You shouldn&#x27;t listen to the hype that tells you consoles suck. They don&#x27;t. They have points about them that are very valid (ease of use, portability, instant gaming). Just dont buy into the hype and use arguments made by 12 year old youtube jockeys to make your point. You do not need to excuse your gaming habits. Just go play, its fun.",1405701611

I can always switch away from them to someone who provides me with better service.  But when they actively lobby to prevent municipalities from constructing their own broadband networks (which would provide competition) and when they actively lobby to get the FCC to change the rules to favor themselves over consumers BY LAW I also have a problem.<p>Introduce enough competition into the marketplace and I don&#x27;t care what any one particular player does.

You were so close to beating the level that time but you lost your last life :( Get an extra life right now and you&#x27;ll kill it this time around!!!.<p>Sadly, a portion of total players (1-2% from what I&#x27;ve seen) will fall for these emotional tactics and spend the money, often more than once.

I don’t live in Bangkok (about 75km north in Ayutthaya, the old capital), but outside the city in the other cities/large towns (excluding perhaps Pattaya and Phuket CBD which cater to (sex) tourists), renting and buying a 3+ bedroom house can be very cheap. If you want to live right in the city in a Bangkok shoebox, yes you will pay for the &quot;privilege&quot;.<p>2. The only time our grocery bill is anything like it was in Australia is if we a) go to the cash-and-carry store and buy bulk things and/or b) go to one of the &#x27;upmarket&#x27; supermarkets to get imported stuff. If you go to one of the fresh markets to get fruit and veg (and potentially meat too) it&#x27;s ridiculously cheap.<p>3. I don&#x27;t know the US car market but generally they are slightly cheaper here than Australia, however that only works if you buy locally made. <i>ANY</i> imported vehicle automatically has 120% import tax.<p>4. If you eat in a local restaurant, $30 (~1000 Baht) will generally pay the bill for dinner for about 6 people. If you go to a western-ish restaurant (i.e. western style menu items but often with a slight thai touch, or adjusted ingredients) the same amount might cover 2 people, it might go up to $45 (~1500 Baht). $200 for two people is fucking insane, unless you&#x27;re eating where all the hi-so Thais go just to be seen, and show they have money.<p>Your comment on street food tells me that you fall into the &quot;not want to&quot; category, and that is part of your expense problem. We regularly have street food, and I have only once had a bad experience (it didn&#x27;t make me sick, I took a bite and couldn&#x27;t eat it). If we get dinner from a street vendor its guaranteed we will pay less than $5 for both of us, for (generally) a meal made fresh in front of you, that is delicious.<p>To state that $30-$200 (~1000 - ~7000 Baht) to eat out is &quot;normal&quot; but that &quot;you can get cheaper food on the streets, you may or may not want to&quot; is like saying &quot;there are cheaper toilets than this solid gold one, you may or may not want to use them&quot;.<p>5. Just like your $200 dinner for two, I think you&#x27;re either shopping at the &quot;hi-so&quot; playgrounds (aka shopping malls), or you&#x27;re paying the farrang (foreigner) tax.<p>As I learnt very quickly - if you want to live your western lifestyle, yes it will be expensive, because a lot of things you might want have to be imported and are thus\n * more expensive for the retailer\n * considered a luxury item thus worthy of higher markup\n * targeted at foreigners thus worthy of even higher markup",1405701029

BUT can be explained <i>far better</i> with language.<p>Math could be considered (or is?) a language, but is a shitty one (like a truly compressed C/Perl code) that as one-liner code is great to encode fast some stuff, but at large, is not the best way to convey <i>IDEAS</i>.<p>That is why I&#x27;m using words, here. Not math!.<p>That is why a programming language is made of WORDS, not math symbols. That is why, you don&#x27;t write a app with math, you use symbols and languages.<p>That is why math is based in the kind of symbols derived from language, too.<p>This NOT mean math is useless or bad or something else. Is just a obvious observation: Math is not the focus in programming. Is not the focus in almost anything that happen in the realm of a human mind, UNTIL you need it. And programming stuff you don&#x27;t need much of it, and when you truly need it? Still language dominate the task.<p>Not believe? Go read the source code luke, and see how much math vs words are there. You can check any large codebase, and see it for yourself.<p>When the analogy of &quot;Programming is like a car.. is like building a house, is like ....&quot; fall apart nobody insist that programming is like architecture. So why do the same with math?",1405699584

This is because the way advertising works on Google advertisers bid for position, Google runs an auction, and the highest bid wins (at the next to highest price, it was at least when I was there a dutch auction[1]) So when CPCs fall, they do so because the highest bid has fallen, and the advertiser is setting their bids, so if they set them lower then it means they &quot;value&quot; being at the best position lower and thus &quot;value&quot; that ad placement slightly less.<p>Now flip your point of view around to that of the advertiser, you&#x27;ve got $1M to spend on internet advertising. Every quarter you advertise with different strategies and campaigns and you measure your business. If you are like many you are constantly tweaking that, some print, some radio, some Internet, vary the mix vary the message, these folks A/B test the crap out of this stuff. When you find bidding $5.00 a click gets you the same business activity as bidding $4.90 a click you say &quot;Great, that gives us more money to spend on some other channel!&quot; You have just reduced the CPC that Google sees from you by 2% and you are still getting the results you want.<p>When CPC is eroding both quarter to quarter and year to year it means that people as spending less money on buying ads from Google on a per ad basis. They may get more total impressions (and this is what I suspect Pichette thinks is the confounding variable in the paradox) but each impression is worth less. And the interesting thing that Marissa Meyer proved at Google early on was that people valued less intrusive advertising over what Altavista and Yahoo where doing at the time. I believe her insights still hold, and if Google continues to add more &#x27;slots&#x27; into their properties they are going to erode value (ad blindness). It is a tough spot for them.<p>[1] New hires back in 2010 got to do a class called &#x27;life of a dollar&#x27; which was perhaps the absolute best introduction to how Google monetizes search you could get.",1405699281

College provides the social network, acculturation, and signaling that make it much more likely to gain access to such career paths. A good college is a college that has the best reputation and attracts the smartest and most savvy fellow students. Everyone has an incentive to attend a college with an existing reputation and students bid up the prices for these limited slots.<p>Also, colleges can pursue perfect price discrimination. The sticker price is set very high to extract the most money from those who can easily pay. The price is discounted based on ability to pay.<p><i>Why does formal education exist at all?</i><p>Well, originally, books were really expensive, thus self-teaching was hard, so the most cost-effective way to learn was from a lecture or a teacher with a slate board.<p>Currently, it exists because the formal education system teaches everyone that the formal education system is very important, that economic growth and our national competitiveness depend on more and more people going to college.

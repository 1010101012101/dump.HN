The VCs are being prudent and cautious to ensure that they can keep their existing portfolio companies going.<p>Remember, they aren't looking for 10x returns, they're looking for 100x+ returns.

2864933,comment,2862629,2863663,5,0,Cushman,,,"Inheritance in JavaScript isn't ""a mess"", it's a paradigm you don't understand[1]. Objects in JavaScript don't have ""classes"", they have prototypes, so if you want class-like behavior, <i>of course</i> you'll have to implement that yourself. Just like if I want to make key access on a dict fall through to another dict if the key isn't present in Python, I'll have to implement <i>that</i> myself. You may think that's silly, but <i>in a prototypal language that is fundamental behavior.</i><p>The `new` keyword was intended to provide the <i>appearance</i> of classes (Java classes, specifically) to make prototypal inheritance less scary to users such as yourself coming from a class-based background, but it's a scam— it creates an object with a prototype, not an instance of a class, and as you're aware it has only caused more confusion about how object inheritance in JS really works.<p>I find the distaste that new developers have for `__proto__` a little analogous to an inexperienced front-end-only Lisp developer who likes parts of the language, but thinks the whole thing would make more sense without `eval` confusing things at runtime. They're not <i>wrong</i>, exactly, they just misunderstand something fundamental about the way the language actually works. The object prototype is <i>there</i>, it's mutable, and that should be exposed. Ignoring it won't make it go away.<p>So I'm not surprised you haven't seen a use case for prototypal inheritance, just like that guy hasn't seen a use case for `eval`. You're not going to because you're not looking; you're thinking of objects in JS as having classes, and that's just a fundamental misunderstanding.<p>For what it's worth, I only write CoffeeScript, which makes everything you think is a hassle in JS easy. In particular, the `class` keyword which has a much prettier, more traditional-seeming syntax to build constructors. But it's a highly leaky abstraction— if you don't understand that what it's compiling to is a function that creates a constructor and sets properties on its `.prototype` one at a time, you will be very confused by the more complex behavior. On the other hand, if you <i>do</i> understand what's going on behind the scenes, it allows for powerful metaprogramming, since you can call methods of the ""parent class"" or even the prototype itself <i>during</i> the definition.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming</a>",1312911727

Verizon was rolling out Fiber to the Premises in Tampa, and finally after so many water/sewer main breaks, the state/county/municipality blocked them from using equipment to dig.. they had to start digging by shovel. That really put a damper on the FiOS deployment.

StackOverflow is great. But there is a profound difference between StackOverflow is doing, and what Farmville is doing.<p>StackOverflow is trying to produce community resources of lasting value. Their ""game"" system is merely a way of recording that value, and allocating resources. It is fundamentally based on the judgments of the community.<p>Meanwhile, Farmville is clever at making an activity which simply enriches the game's owners <i>look</i> like the construction of community resources, or <i>look</i> like competition to display valuable skills.<p>My view is that there is no ""gamification"".

E.g. the Haskell compiler knows that a Maybe Bool can have only three possible values: Just True, Just False or Nothing.<p>How do you do this in Clojure with dynamic typing?

2864818,comment,2863604,2864728,2,0,masklinn,,,"> Predeclared variables are just as prone to typos, which will also break your code<p>Not so: declaring variable name & scope ensures immunity to the ""I wanted to change this variable, but I'm creating a new one instead"", and this can be checked statically even in dynamically typed languages.<p>> There are no situations where shadowing a variable is desirable.<p>While I do not agree with this assertion, I can see where you come from and explicit scoping is still superior to implicit for this: if there are no situation where shadowing is desirable, you can make the language statically forbid shadowing. There, done.<p>>  It's always best to be able to reach any variable that exists in the current lexical scope, should you find the need.<p>It is <i>not</i>, however, desirable to reach and unknowingly alter an existing variable in an ancestral lexical scope when you did not mean to and just happened to pick an existing name in a callback 2-levels down the stack. The result of this is silent corruption of program state, and it is a risk in any implicitly-declared scoping system with mutable bindings.<p>> The only ambiguous situation in which you'd want to use a ""var"" on purpose is to explicitly shadow an external variable of the same name -- if you accept that shadowing is undesirable, and choosing a more descriptive name for the inner variable is preferable, then QED.<p>Then QED nothing, since as I pointed out it is perfectly possible to make variable shadowing statically illegal, ensuring that no variable is hidden <i>and no variable is silently reused or replaced either</i>.<p>> Dynamic languages should not have variable declarations.<p>Nope.<p>Furthermore, explicit scoping significantly increases readability and lowers cognitive burden: readers don't have to wonder whether a given assignment is local to the current lexical scope, it's spelled out for them. And if it's a bare assignment (not a new variable), explicit scoping makes it easier to find out where the variable is first used. Not to mention it allows the language to protect against in-scope reuse (in cases of debatable-quality imperative code with scopes more than a screenful long), as the second declaration may (and generally will) be statically marked as the redeclaration of an existing variable, and will be refused by the language's runtime.<p>And all of that for the cost, in most languages, of 3 characters. Almost nothing. All the issues you mentioned (since you didn't mention typing) are not issues of explicit scoping but with specific implementations thereof.",1312910207

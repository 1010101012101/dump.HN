771428,story,,,2,0,jcrocholl,"Ask HN: Review my idea: Online transcription service with ASR",,"I want to make online transcription (speech to text) more accurate, faster, and cheaper at the same time. Users can upload MP3 files of interviews or podcasts or any other voice recording, using a web form or an API. Or they can call a phone number, enter their account number with the dial pad, and dictate their message after the beep.<p>My first step would be to cut the input into 5-minute chunks and use automatic speech recognition (ASR) to generate a rough outline for the transcription. Then each transcription chunk is posted automatically to Amazon Mechanical Turk for proofreading and editing. Turkers can earn points for good work, and this will qualify them for premium tasks which cost more.<p>The resulting Audio and Text can be used to improve the acoustic models for the speech recognition engine, so the automatic transcripts get better over time, and less work is required for proofreading and editing. It would be possible to train several classes of speaker-independent acoustic models, e.g. adult female speaker with German accent. Languages other than English are possible too.<p>This service is very similar to castingwords.com but faster and cheaper because it uses self-improving speech recognition technology.<p>Please let me know what you think. I'm planning to implement a simple prototype in Seattle during the next few weeks. Want to brainstorm with me over beer or coffee? We could be co-founders if we work well together.",1250628372

Real world behaviorally driven events rarely fit into a neat statistical framework, so don't try and force them to, you'll just get bad results out of your model.<p>I would recommend reading his fooled by randomness book as well (and I may be remembering details from that one as well in this comment).",1250627985

Creative Nomad and (soon at least) WinMo are evidence of that (on the other hand, there's Newton, which was way too early to market).<p>It remains to be seen whether or not their more successful products fall into a MS Word-like malaise (see my other comment) now that they're entrenched in the media player and smart phone spaces.

That assumption generally doesn't hold among people with any sort of academic CS background.  Multiplication algorithms - and the fact that they were typically O(N) in number of bits - were covered in my intro machine architectures course.<p>In practice, there are many, many other things that can negatively impact hash table performance in a much bigger way.  Like cache misses - one cache miss costs far more than an integer multiplication.  Or interpreter overhead from using, say, Ruby instead of C (bad example, since Ruby's hashtables are implemented in C, but the general point holds).  Or the difference between -O0 and -O3.  Or how early versions of Java Hashtables would often devolve into linked lists because the hash function only looked at the first 8 characters of a string.",1250625774

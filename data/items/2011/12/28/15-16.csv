3400129,comment,3399087,3399087,2,0,mechanical_fish,,,"For some reason I can't get this anecdote about mid-20th-century variety show host Ed Sullivan out of my head. In the words of Jack Carter (former TV comedian, host of <i>Cavalcade of Stars</i> in the 1940s, and who <i>OMFG</i> is still performing at age 88):<p><i>The censors flagged you on everything. When you did [the Ed Sullivan show] you couldn't say belly button. You couldn't say navel. You had to say aperture. Sullivan once said to me [imitating Ed Sullivan's voice], ""That's an aperture in the human body.""</i><p><i>I said, ""It's an asshole, but I'm not saying it.""</i><p><i>""You can't say that on my show. I don't want any belly buttons or navels.""</i><p>(That's from Jeff Kisseloff's <i>The Box: An Oral History of Television 1920-1961</i>, which is basically the <i>Founders at Work</i> of TV and is one of my favorite books.)<p>Of course, Ed Sullivan had the advantage of running a broadcast TV show. It was one-to-many broadcasting and it didn't try to scale, so it could be censored directly by one human, Ed Sullivan. And according to Jack Carter, Sullivan had an unmistakably human approach to censorship:<p><i>JACK CARTER: The exposure you got from being on Sullivan was unbeatable, but Sullivan was vicious. Sullivan was crazed. That veneer of being [slips into a perfect Sullivan imitation] very holier-than-thou. ""Hi there, the moms are out here, and the priests are my dear friends. These nice youngsters..."" But when you got into the dressing room after your run-through, he called you in [again, as Sullivan]: ""What kind of fucking shit is that? You do that shit on my fucking show. You asshole. Fuck you with that shit... [et cetera, et cetera - ed] You can't do that."" It was hysterical.</i>",1325087649

I was asking why he so insists on his right to level as much criticism as he can at a FOSS project when there are clearly ways to get the job done.<p>What I said was that there already are places to bring your ideas and criticism. You say ""the code browser should have had line numbers support"" - well, by what right is that a necessity? If it <i>really</i> was such a bad idea to not have line numbers, you'd think people would be all over this for the past 7 years. They weren't, because there already is a way to figure out the line numbers. It might be a matter of taste whether their old solution did the job, but that's why I think it's a sign of how the consensus has shown that it wasn't needed.<p>Now the tables have turned - somebody went through the trouble to get the code done, enough people were convinced that it's a good idea and it has been accepted.

She started out buying books from estates and old people looking to downsize. She'd take anything, paying a flat rate of something like 10 cents a book, and would show up at your house and haul away all the books. Then she'd list all the books on Amazon. Even if the book was selling for one cent she would make money on the shipping, since shipping costs slightly less than Amazon's shipping allowance (unless the book weighed over a certain amount and thus she'd lose money on shipping, in which case she'd recycle it, as she did with books in unsaleable condition). After a while she built bookshelves in her garage which let her store I believe tens of thousands of books, and hired people to do the book listing and shipping for her. She also moved on to more large-scale ways of acquiring books, like arranging with churches and schools to pick up the books that people left in their donation boxes.

The only penalty I see in C++ for using classes or polymorphism is that it produces longer symbol names (w/ the type mangling)<p>There are other penalties which people who write C++ are oblivious to. For example, switching the class of an established object in runtime:<p>Suppose you have two compatible class layouts (same field order and types, different methods). When you implement dispatch yourself, switching the behavior is a simple matter of replacing the vtbl pointer from one class to the other (I'm not sure Linux VFS does this, but it's common enough in C object systems).<p>Whereas if you use C++, the standard solution is to break this into a dataless ""strategy"" object (which can be changed independently of the data) and a data object which contains the state. If you never had the luxury of doing something like ""if (obj->class == Living) obj->class = Zombie"", you don't miss it, but it doesn't mean you're not missing out on some flexibility.<p>> Of course, just because you're using classes doesn't mean you're doing any useful object-oriented programming.<p>Furthermore, just because you are doing object-oriented programming doesn't mean it is useful. (And a purist would say, just because you are doing programming, doesn't meant it is useful)<p>> Right now, you'd have to do a lot of convincing to get me to write native code in straight C again.<p>I've switched to C++ in 1993 and back to C in 2004 when compile times with boost started to measure on a geological time scale and single error messages spilled onto my 2nd screen -- and haven't looked back. When a write GUIs, I do use FLTK which is C++ (very effective, but not idiomatic), because I haven't seen a GUI toolkit as good that's native C -- but other than that, I don't miss anything, and I'm not less productive.<p>C++, the language, has a lot of useful tools, but C++, the ecosystem, guarantees that in any nontrivial project you'll be thrown into the tarpit.

I'm still new to techno but I'd recommend both the CLR.net and Drumcode.se podcasts, but get yourself a decent pair of headphones :)<p>Dubstep can be fantastic for coding but I prefer the darker more underground tunes as opposed to Skrillex and the poppy sound which gets played a lot recently. Keep an eye out for tunes by Mala, Kode9, SP:MC, Distance, Lynx, Skream, Loefah. I listen to Youngsta's shows on Rinse.FM which you can download from their site on Tuesday mornings GMT.<p>Also some downtempo/chilled stuff is good for more relaxed coding.

But I don't think this is the point Bjarne is trying to make.<p>C++ challenges you to think in terms of types instead of functions. This is in my opinion often a more natural way to approach and solve problems and thus produces more elegant code. Because of that, C++ is a very powerful tool for library developers - you can design libraries that allow domain-specific developers to write expressive code that performs as if you had written more verbose C code. And this C++ code is not only more expressive for your fellow co-workers to read and understand but also in some cases for the compiler. This is the reason why C++ code can sometimes be compiled to faster machine code: you can give the compiler more information about what you actually try to accomplish (keyword: template meta-programming).<p>As with most things there is no definite answer.

Notably privateers with letters of marque against Spanish shipping had British, French and Dutch ports to hide in.<p>Piracy developed when the pirates could appear easily as privateers. If you didn't piss of your host nation, then you were free to loot the ships you wanted. Then pirates gained enough money and power that they could start their own micronations. Note that privateer ships were often enlisted by the military during wars, so it's safe to assume an assault on a pirate haven was out of the question for the military. Especially when pirate controlled settlements were often cleared by privateers issued letters of marque on condition of clearing the settlement.<p>I don't see how governments will keep ships out of the hands of criminals when governments show little desire to exploit space, where as corporations do. Corporations will grow very quickly in space, governments won't. Governments are likely to spread via colonies rather than commerce or expansion.<p>The guy doesn't argue convincingly that there won't be pirates, because his argument should have meant pirates wouldn't have existed in the 1700's. The Spanish knew where the pirates and privateers were running to, but they were well enough armed that you wanted superior numbers. So it was a matter of attacking a solitary ship with more fire power before it could reach a safe port.<p>Even though Port Royal and Tortuga were known as lawless ports, there was plenty of law there. The Spanish weren't about to invade a port with cannons on its battlements and dozens of privateer and pirate ships docked. Many of these pirate ships were better crewed and equipped than their respective nations military ships. Stede Bonnet had a sloop with 120 men and 16 guns. He was captured when he only had 50 men and was beached in a harbour. Notably the military brought 2 of the same tonnage ship, notably 8 gun vessels which Bonnet's ship had originally been at the start of his life of crime. [Edit: IIRC Rhett had 130 men on his two ships and simply outlasted Stede whose crew surrendered - Stede wanted to blow his ship up rather than surrender]",1325085127

If you didn't start out wanting polymorphism, but then wanted to add it, C++ is way less work to do it.<p>Why code this all by hand when the language can do it for you at no penalty? The only penalty I see in C++ for using classes or polymorphism is that it produces longer symbol names (w/ the type mangling)<p>You also get destructors that let you have convenient clean up of locally-allocated data (boost scoped_ptr), which helps make sure you don't leak memory/reduces bugs/reduced thinking required.<p>That's all possible without pulling out massive standard libraries or using slow-compiling/hard-to-diagnose template-based libraries (merits of those I leave undiscussed).<p>My biggest problem with C++ is a lack of a standard ABI (perhaps this has been addressed by know, it's been a while). C libraries are dead easy to link to. You know what you're getting. C++--not at all, unless you live entirely in the same compiler ecosystem.<p>One of the biggest <i>perceived</i> problems with C++ is that people start thinking: ""well, now that I am using an OO language, it's time to write some classes!"" Of course, just because you're using classes doesn't mean you're doing any useful object-oriented programming.<p>If you're attempting your next project in C++, coming from C: only use those features of C++ that directly benefit you. Follow YAGNI. If most of your program is in flat procedures, alongside some objects, so be it.<p>Side rant: Consider that C++'s real uptake was in mid-90's, just as UML-ish diagrams began taking hold along with a massive rise of overdesign and no culture of agility. This led to massively overdesigned C++ apps. I'm sure the C developers were sitting there and wondering ""Why the hell do I need all these classes? This used to be so much simpler."" (I know I was.) Think about the horror that was J2EE--the same kind of thinking that led to J2EE also permeated C++ development at the time.<p>Right now, you'd have to do a lot of convincing to get me to write native code in straight C again.",1325084909

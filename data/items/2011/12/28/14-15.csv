3399883,comment,3396465,3399246,1,0,electromagnetic,,,"Incidentally it was the nations of England, France, Spain and Denmark that caused piracy. Not only did they give charters to captains to give them the right to attack another nations ships, but they harboured them.<p>The British ports were notorious for this. Spain had control of the gold, so Britain allowed their pirates to attack the gold galleons and haul it back to British ports. The pirates would eventually spend said gold in the port buying items imported from Europe and transferring wealth back to the old world (incidentally this actually faired better for England than it did Spain, as the Spanish gold went into the governments coffers. The stolen gold entered the economy).<p>I agree, piracy isn't likely to happen just randomly. Without ports harbouring pirates the oceans became clear pretty quickly. The European superpowers didn't want to go to war with each other, but it was still in their own best advantage to sabotage the other.<p>Remember the majority of 'pirates' were privateers. Many privateer ships were commissioned when their host nation went to war and decommissioned when the war ended. Whenever you see in the movies a pirate ship landing at Port Royal or Tortuga, then they likely had letters of marque from Britain or France against the Spanish, if not they would be real pirates and even then they'd have safe harbour if they didn't piss off the authorities.<p>Steed Bonnet for instance was a pirate attacking British/any vessels. However he received an official pardon (along with Blackbeard) from his life of crime. However (unlike Blackbeard) he set sail for a Dutch settlement to buy a letter of marque and become a Dutch privateer against the Spanish. However, this didn't happen. He turned to all out piracy very shortly after his departure and when news got back that it was him, then the governor that pardoned him sent the military after him. Then he did the neck hanging dance.<p>Privateers were even known to reclaim colonies from pirates for being issued letters of marque.<p>IMO piracy and privateers have a very strong likelihood of occurring. We're already seeing signs that it's going to be companies to exploit space before governments, similar to in the Caribbean. It will only take one nation permitting privateers to operate before all nations and companies of size will be operating privateers. It's the logical step if governments aren't capable of exerting their force more than corporations.",1325084015

And being caught in this vicious circle, embedded developers still aren't (and probably won't be for still quite some time) accustomed to programming at higher abstraction levels than what C offers.

He certainly appeals to many lofty ideas which may not be entirely justified by the technical material, but the technical material itself is certainly sound as far as I can tell. The main criticism I would make is that he does not draw a clear enough boundary between accepted mathematical fact and his own speculation.<p>For me, the thing I like about the book is that it is almost a total mixture of formal logic and poetry. If you don't like it, that is a subjective aesthetic judgement. Same goes for his prose style.<p>I suppose if you were already fully exposed to all the mathematical concepts in the book when you read it, it would have a lot less value. If on the other hand it is almost your first exposure to these ideas, it's like freebasing pure logic while hanging out in alice's wonderland. Great fun, but I agree not a formal examination of the ideas. It isn't really meant to be as far as I can tell.",1325083743

In Peter Norwig's presentation, he claims 17 of the 23 are either invisible or much simpler for Dylan - we can make the same claim for Python, Perl, Ruby et al.<p>But even in Python, some patterns are non-obvious, and it's better that the developer knows them beforehand, rather than re-inventing them. Apart from the non-obvious ones, you sometimes need the others as they condense a paragraph of explanation to single term.<p>Factory isn't one of those non-obvious patterns - a competent developer, given the problem for the factory pattern(the above Image.open) will invent factory in under 5 minutes.",1325083742

In both of these functions you'd be basically accessing  either element i+imax * j of your data array if you are implementing the matrix as a single array, or the j-th element of the i-th row if you were using a pointer to pointer structure. the C version would work on the provided matrix structire whereas the C++ would use the implicitly provided <i>this</i> structure.

They tend to look messy to me, they seem to try too hard to match me with this guy, connect me with that, make me follow one group and post to another. Arguably FB is worse right now, but I see the trend in G+ as well. RSS (and, occasionally Twitter) is good enough for reading for me. Mail and IM (GTalk, ironically) is enough for contacting the people around me.<p>- Privacy. I do have a Facebook account, mostly to stay in contact with some friends back in Germany. I tried to lock down the account as much as possible regarding privacy settings and my list of friends contains ~40 - well - friends (or family). I don't 'collect' friends and have no 'friends'.<p>- The combination of my mail(sort of, reduced that a lot already)/contacts/calendar/IM (hi, Android) provider with a 'You need to provide an ID if we feel like it'/'We delete your stuff if we feel like it'/'Pseudonyms are not wanted here' attitude social network seems scary. For one because I don't trust the 'plus' part of Google any single bit by now. And in addition I'd throw a large amount of extra free data about myself at a company that already collects far too much - for no benefit.<p>- It's full of bull.. Maybe it's me, but I had an account in the past, tried to follow interesting persons and ended up with pseudonym noise (people that were interesting being deleted, everyone discussing about this policy etc) or animated gif images. It was more 4chan than anything else - and I really tried hard to block people after the first 1-2 'offenses'.<p>- I loved the idea of circles, that is until I started to use them. The metaphor seemed nice at first, but it became frustrating after I moved past the first 20-30 contacts.<p>1: Actually I tend to reserve the word hate for things that - well - are actually of importance. 'I hate X' where X is a thing or a person I temporarily disagree with seems inflationary use of the term 'hate'.",1325082673

3399765,comment,3396465,3399144,1,0,electromagnetic,,,"I don't disagree, but remember the number of asteroids over 100km is around 200. The number of asteroids over 1km is between 700,000 and 1.7 million. That means the very big asteroids are between 0.0003% and 0.0001% of the objects in the asteroid belt. Given that the smallest known Aten asteroid is ~5m in diameter, then it's an easy conjecture that the asteroid belt is likely to have tens if not hundreds of million asteroids <1km in diameter.<p>They're going to have enough mass that blasting them is going to be impractical. It's going to be a waste attacking a mining asteroid if you're dumping hundreds of munitions at every nearby rock.<p>> If it has sensors, it has electronics; if it has electronics, those electronics are running at something above 3 Kelvin; if you're running anywhere above 3 Kelvin, you can be seen against the cosmic background.<p>This is very true, however given the variation in albedo's of asteroids and meteoroids then there's going to be a wide range of 'normal' temperatures for asteroids. With enough processing power you could assume that people would eventually start calculating asteroid albedo vs distance from sun vs apparent temperature. If you've got a light rock that's hot as all hell, then you might be best to shoot it just in case. Probably not likely for civilians at least, even the military might not want to be running too much processing power as they'd have greater heat sinking issues to worry about.<p>The real thing that will determine how hard or easy to find mines will be is human mining. How much dirt and debris are we going to be producing, or even purposefully producing. If we're mining bigger asteroids are we going to require ships to land, or simply dump payloads into orbit for ships to snag. If we're doing the latter, then we're talking about hundreds of objects running well above background levels. How much rock are we going to strip off an asteroid and leave nearby?<p>If piracy or warfare becomes real, then mining companies will likely want to limit the approach vectors for incoming ships. What better way than dumping copious amounts of junk in your orbit. Given that a cubic meter of silica weighs around 2500kg, then you're not likely to crash your ship into it at any speed. Put thousands of these in orbit, and people are only going to approach from the clear paths.<p>Again, all these rocks would be hotter than background, and you only have to mine 1% for it to be a solid defence. Making someone take 100 shots in 1-hit wins warfare is a very effective defence.",1325081217

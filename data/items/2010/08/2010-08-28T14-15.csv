If coders (most of whom work in a corporate environment) ever found out that Microsoft was looking through their code for a non-emergency reason, they'd immediately turn off error reporting on all of their systems (not to mention, file a few lawsuits), removing sources of crash errors from a sector that is vital to Microsoft (and leading to a decrease in the quality of Windows, and thus, fewer sales).<p>So it's in their best interests to keep those internal controls as strict as possible in order to avoid such a thing.",1283007245

In fact it's exactly the opposite. I am doing all the hard technical work that is sometimes too much. So what do you do? You look to transfer some of it to someone else.

So you look for expertise.<p>And you don't have to know the details of a specific kernel or a TCP/IP stack.

Apache Harmony isn't spec-compliant only because it hasn't been blessed by the TCK, and the only reason it hasn't been blessed by the TCK is because Apache disagrees with the licensing terms of the TCK on principle.  But the intent of Harmony is to be fully-compliant, the code is something like 99.5% there, and Apache believes that other agreements from Sun around Java back up its position on the TCK issue, so if it came down to it, Apache would be in a very strong position if Oracle ever came after it.

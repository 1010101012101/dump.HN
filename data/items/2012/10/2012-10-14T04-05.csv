4650709,comment,4650373,4650373,33,0,pg,,,"This is not the generally accepted view of the cause of Venice's decline, to put it mildly.  Venice owed its power in the medieval period largely to geography.  When trade between Europe and the rest of the world was almost entirely something that happened via the Mediterranean, Venice was the most important port.  After the Spanish and Portuguese discovered sea routes to the Americas, Africa, and the Far East, that was no longer true.  It would have been surprising if Venice hadn't declined after that.<p>It didn't help, either, that at about the same time, the whole Italian peninsula became a prize fought over by the now very powerful kingdoms of France and Spain.  City-states in general were becoming obsolete.<p>Maybe there is some sort of badness going on in the US, but almost any other failing empire would have made a better example than Venice.  There have been few where the external causes of failure were clearer.",1350190614

I admire the R&D effort. We -- bad old Mozilla, including evil-me -- are seriously considering using NaCl (not Pepper) for SFI in native code parts of Servo. No ""hate"" here, so do try to grow up: ""You hate NaCl"" is just weak, beneath you, as an analysis of motives and causes.<p>Let's step away from NaCl as pure tech for safer compilation of unsafe languages.<p>I do call Google's business strategy pushing NaCl+Pepper via games and even (till it all fell apart last November) Flash heavy-handed, and one-sided to such an extent that what's pushed can never be standardized.<p>What's belligerent here is for someone (haberman), who I hear works for Google, a company that has all the money and power in the world, and which makes actual ""pro-NaCl propaganda"" as well as pays game developers and others to use the Chrome-only tech (NaCl, not PNaCl, note well), to fire first on this thread. It wasn't me who showed ""belligerence"".<p>That first shot even tried open-washing, lamely, and it tellingly put Mozilla in the subordinate position. ''I could understand ""we want to be more involved in the process.""''<p>If you don't work for Google or hold a brief for them, ask yourself why haberman's presumption is that Mozilla, or any other browser maker, should be asking or begging to be included in a process that we were excluded from and practically speaking could never participate in without equal big bucks and market power.<p>The great thing about the Web is that no one owns it. Browser vendors, tool makers, and developers (whom the first two groups avidly court) have to reach consensus via standards. And I find that developers, not just pure web devs, definitely including @kripken (Emscripten's creator), @jashkenas (CoffeeScript), and others, are more creative and faster moving than many highly-paid C++-first hackers, including those perpetrating single-vendor follies such as NaCl+Pepper.<p>Whine at me, cry ""hate"" and ""belligerence"" while turning a blind eye to the big gun who fired first, and shoot the messenger. It doesn't matter. NaCl+Pepper have already lost to JS for portable cross-browser high-performance native code compilation.",1350190231

It didn't get rid of the FDIC, but it got rid of certain regulations preventing commercial banks from being investment banks (simplification). So it basically encouraged risk taking by banks. Remove the FDIC, and you'll see much less risk taking. So we really need to get rid of ALL of the Glass-Steagal act. As well, we need to get rid of the SEC.

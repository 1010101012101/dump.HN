Having a better model doesn't work unless you can convince a critical mass of people to use your system.<p>It reminds me of the story of the Arizona Stock Exchange (<a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/1997/09/b3516129.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/1997/09/b3516129.htm</a>), which was (theoretically, anyway) better for trading than the NYSE, but failed because they couldn't convince enough brokerages to leave the NYSE and use AZX instead.",1185303506
36412,comment,36276,36349,0,0,euccastro,,,"The trick is I'm setting my path up so it's motivating in itself.  I'm doing what I most want to do.  I like learning, I like programming, and I like making useful stuff.  I can afford doing just that for a couple years, and even if nothing much comes out of it, it will have been worth it.<p>You have a point, though, and I'll watch out for motivation lows. Thanks for the heads up.",1185303259

Learn by doing (and taking 20 minute every day to read the very best blogs).<p>Screw fundamentals (sounds like you already have a decent base, anyway) -- just build something that someone wants to use/buy (preferably find a co-founder who you can brainstorm ideas with-- find a co-founder when you already have an idea is sometimes more challenging).<p>",1185302955

36407,comment,36365,36401,0,0,webwright,,,"We totally agree.  Rescuetime is combating Big Brother in a few ways:<p>1) It's hard to install without someone knowing.
2) You can pause the data collector at any time.
3) If you're clever enough you can edit your data before it leaves your machine.<p>In short, we're making it EASY TO CHEAT.  Hell, I'll publish a GUIDE to cheating at RescueTime.<p>We're also going to make it against ToS to use as an individual scrutiny tool.  We think this level of individual scrutiny is a crappy way to manage people-- we refuse to be a part of that.",1185301813

36404,comment,36365,36379,0,0,webwright,,,"This is kinda why we built RescueTime.  We found the stopwatch solution to be awkward and, if you fail to remember to turn it on or off, it's VERY hard to recover that information.<p>I've done the time management exercise (the manual log) and found it to be incredibly useful.  Just the act of paying attention made me more productive.  But (like 99.9% of the people who try) I stopped keeping a log-- it was just too much damn work. :-)<p>So I guess we're trying to take the work out of it.",1185301614

What I want right now is focus, and that I can't borrow.  After a couple months, I'll probably want a cofounder and advice from others who have been there.<p>I do have a couple ideas but they are too implementation heavy, and I don't want to commit for so long before having tried lighter alternatives first.<p>Finally, I really feel I have some homework to do before I ask anyone for their money and attention.<p>Thanks for the comments and the encouragement!",1185301559

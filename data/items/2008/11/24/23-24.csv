I think the Reason article is more expository than polemical, which is a major part of my problem with it.<p>Suppose I tell you instead at the top of my article that the following starts from the premise that rocks are alive. Then I proceed to argue that you should destroy your computer and throw it into the ocean to preserve the rights of the minerals therein. The logic is sound and it's written in a witty, convincing style.<p>Sure, that's only one article, and it sounds pretty novel. Now imagine there is a Rocks First! organization that puts out pamphlets, magazines, books, and press releases on rock rights and the mineral personhood amendment, and reinterprets recent history in terms of the silent rock genocides that humans have perpetrated against their inert brethren. You can be pretty sure of the position before you read the material; it is derived from their fundamental beliefs.<p>In such a case, an argument at the core of the fundamental beliefs might sway an organi-centrist to become rock-conscious, but not peripheral stuff about a recent amendment defining marriage as between a human and a human.<p>The Reason article, I think, is just what you would expect someone to say who believed dogmatically in the power of the free market. It doesn't take opposing viewpoints into account on market deregulation, nor does it attempt to address the core issues that convince them this is the proper interpretation of the Clinton years. It leaves a lot of important questions unmentioned and unanswered.",1227570450

Write hex2int (without using any stdlib functions, such as strtoul(s,null, 16) for example. :) )\n2. Delete a node from a singly-linked list.<p>Personally, I found a VERY strong correlation between what we wanted in a game developer and their answer to #1. #2 I didn't find all that valuable, other than to weed out people who'd never taken any algorithm/data structure coursework.<p>For that company, and those roles, it worked very well, because there's a correlation between bit twiddling, pointer operations, and knowing whether someone ""gets"" pointers and their job performance. That's not the case in most jobs, nor in most modern languages. (Who cares if you ""get"" pointers if your language doesn't have them?)<p>My current company asks on from a set of some fairly basic questions on the phone screen, and we pretty much grade the whole phone screen ""pass/fail"" (interview/thank you for your time). I can't say they work quite as well, but we're also looking significantly ""up market"" from what the game company needed.<p>My idealized criteria:\nFor professional hires: keep it short, but not so basic as to be insulting.\nFor college hires: keep it short, and probably basic.\nFor all in-person/whiteboard exercises: ignore error checking, exceptional conditions, etc. It's just too much effort to go through in that format.<p>Best coding test I ever took was for Accolade, who sent a zip file of source code for a very simple game (fly an airplane across a 2D map with mountains) and asked you to write ""AI"" (in the game sense, not the compsci sense) for the player. You had an evening and mailed them back a zip file with your code included. That was fun to do, and I suspect gave them fairly fine-grained insight into how good a coder you were, as there's ""working"", ""optimal"" and ""elegant"" dimensions into which various solutions bucket themselves.",1227569506

This is even easier if you are your own target audience, or if your product is such that your team can 'eat your own dogfood.'<p>2. Don't forget that usability testing typically only makes sense if the participant is in your target audience.  If you are targeting some sort of specific niche audience or need (and most businesses probably are), it's worth taking time/$ to find the right kind of person versus someone online who has no context for the need you're trying to solve.  If you already have customers, some of them will almost certainly be excited to help test new features.<p>3. If you're doing research interactively, consider having someone who didn't design the product asking the questions: it's really easy to bias the results based on your expectations.<p>Finally, it's certainly not cheap but if you ever have a chance to do usability research in a lab with genuine 1-way glass, it's a blast!",1227568737

I was beginning to think I was the only one.</i><p>People with a background in non-brace-and-semicolon languages are more likely to feel the same way.  Others (e.g. recent graduates learning only Java) may be less comfortable with the lack of semicolons, and may regard it as ""sloppy,"" perhaps from a lack of familiarity, or because they've never thought about it or haven't read the specs and are simply regurgitating what they've heard.<p>On a related note, in CSS the semicolon is a separator, not a terminator, so to pick on some CSS from an arbitrary Web page:<p><pre><code>    body  { font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; color:#828282; } /* unnecessary semicolon */\n    body  { font-family:Verdana; font-size:10pt; color:#828282 } /* equivalent but shorter */\n</code></pre>\nAlso on the topic of cargo-cult coding cruft, you'll often see pseudo-XHTML with self-closing tags that include a space, e.g. ""<br />"", invariably served as text/html, where it is equivalent to ""<br>"" with the addition of two extraneous characters and one syntax error.  People still actively recommend this practice, despite the fact that even when served as HTML, the extra space has not been necessary since the days of Netscape Navigator 3 or 4.<p><i>Perhaps with very, very large and complex code if the JavaScript engine uses an old-style interpreter?</i><p>JavaScript is only parsed once, even in ancient browsers, and no matter how much code there is, the time required to download it, not to mention executing it, will typically be orders of magnitude greater than the time spent parsing it.  I had never heard the performance reason before as a justification for this practice, but I consider it a total red herring until someone provides hard numbers that suggest otherwise.<p>Ultimately this is a question of style and personal preference, but if you happen to prefer the cleaner style as I do, I see no technical reasons why you should not use it.<p>Finally, never forget Wadler's Law:<p><a href=""http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Wadlers_Law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Wadlers_Law</a>",1227567859

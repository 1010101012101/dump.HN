529828,comment,529492,529775,0,0,gojomo,,,"Google has killed a bunch of unprofitable projects recently. Lively died with 6 weeks' warning, and users who wanted to save their 3D handiwork were told to do so by ""taking videos and screenshots of your rooms"". I don't blame Google -- they don't owe anyone continued development of a money-losing business line -- but it happens.<p>And that's with Google still making barrels of money and not yet facing significant antitrust action for using profits from search to underprice products in other markets (like cloud services). With a few unprofitable quarters or lawsuits, what's the guarantee GAE will continue in an attractive form indefinitely? What if they decide they have to maximize revenue from developers locked-into the GAE platform? (Or what if the core team leaves to do their own startup?)<p>Even a tiny risk that another company could yank your platform out from under you on short notice, for arbitrary reasons having to do with their business needs (and not yours), may be unacceptable. AppScale mitigates that risk -- a lot.",1237877060

It provides a solid foundation in probability with an emphasis on applications (rather than proof).  Statistics is but one application of probability and is not heavily emphasized by the class (at least when I took it).  That said if you understand 6.041 you'll understand statistics without much more work.  Good luck and have fun!",1237876774

It's the client's money that pays for everything in the end, of course.<p>I'm sure it's human nature to fall for flattery and impressive displays of wealth, but since most of this money comes from institutions of various kinds (many of them owned or controlled by governments around the world), there should be a at least a decent amount of checking what the money is used for.

For some reason, people seem to have given up on it long ago.<p>Also, I am not sure that having a professional landlord would ensure timely repairs. I lived in a house in Cleveland Heights where the landlord's philosophy was to wait to make repairs until a problem ballooned out of control.<p>Instead of fixing a slow washing machine drain pipe, he waited until it was completely clogged. At that point, doing laundry meant a flooded basement. My roommates and I had to go down there with buckets to bail it out until he had the problem fixed a month later. Every time we called him he would assure that someone was ""stopping by next week.""<p>We also had cracks in our plaster walls that spread so much that the entire wall crumbled to bits.

If the registrant dies then something happens to that contract. As a registrar for example we don't care who pays for the domain name and this happens quite frequently (designer pays etc.). But paying for the domain doesn't get you access to login and gain access to the account. In order to do that there would have to be some legal document (court document) which allows the new person to take control of the account. (And we've received this).<p>Now on a ""wink wink nod nod"" basis of course a registrar can do what they want to do whether legal, allowed or not.<p>But in the case of this domain, if we were the registrar, we wouldn't because the entire thing is to high visibility.<p>It would actually be quite easy for someone to (for whatever reason) blow the whistle on name.com doing something like this.

5047980,comment,5046784,5047927,1,0,zanny,,,"> changing to UTC everywhere is moving complexity, I stand by the ""keep the complexity where we have it already"" :)<p>Like I said, it eliminates the class of complexity that matters. Scheduling appointments and synchronizing people across time zones, something more common today, and will become more common forever into the future, and will become absurd once we have regular space travel, is a much larger cost set than when people move across what are currently time zones permanently, and need to adapt to getting up or doing things at different numerical times habitually.<p>> well, no. ..... so maybe europe's being pulled from east asia being pulled from americas being pulled from europe ad infinitum.<p>They won't tell you the hours in your time, and if they do, they are doing time zone conversion math already. Right off the bat, you have undue overhead in communicating time. The question is that people would be used to having the ""day"" be between a certain set of hours in one place, and then by migrating across what was a zone boundary what they would expect is now an hour off from their internal clock, because most people still behave in some synchrony with the sun.<p>1. You won't avoid someones internal clock being off by moving into an area of different daylight hours. To note, time zones only make the number match by longitude as well, latitudinally crossing the equator or going extreme distances north or south produces the same effect (different areas have different patterns of awakeness based on the availably of the sun) so that will already offset regular operating hours of various things, just moving north or south. Using UTC universally makes that concept ubiquitous as well, rather than having the disparity that moving east or west ""changes' the time, but going north or south doesn't, but going <i>anywhere</i> societies change the operating schedules.<p>Like I said, I think it is much easier on anyone considering business to have a unified time standard, and accept that the hours of public services and resources will be different wherever they go, instead of converting time across zones for purposes of communication or meetings.",1358005273

5047972,comment,5046845,5047405,8,0,ahoyhere,,,"No, if you want to be logical, it's clear that suicide is rarely the right choice, and that it's the suicidal person whose critical thinking abilities are impaired.<p>It's simple: Most people who feel suicidal are feeling suicidal because of/in conditions which are shared by hundreds, thousands, millions of other people. All you have to do, as a rational actor, to decide if suicide makes sense, is to look at what those other people are making of the same situation. In the case of being prosecuted for white collar crimes, most people go on to take their lumps (deserved or not), then go back to their families and a perfectly reasonable existence. There is life afterwards, plenty of it. In some cases, like fraud and hacking etc., quite a few folks turn their experience on the wrong side of the law into valuable consulting gigs. Humans have been evolutionarily selected for resilience.<p>And, on the flip side, if we're talking interminable physical pain or a fatal disease which is incurable & will only lead to worse and worse deterioration and an unbearably slow death, you can use the same approach to see that suicide may make sense in that situation, to avoid an inescapable fate that all those other people in the same situation are <i>definitely</i> and <i>verifiably</i> experiencing.<p>The thing about suicidal depression is it cuts off your ability to think like this. You cannot even IMAGINE a world where things get better, where there's an ""After."" You feel utterly alone often because you cut yourself off from people who love you & would help you. You think your pains are so special and unique, nobody could understand, and you may even get angry when people try to help you because they can't possibly ""get it"". You think they're against you. You imagine how much your death will hurt the parties trying to persecute you (real or imagined). Maybe you even think ""I'll show them!"" or that you will make a good martyr. All of which is nonsense, even though it's very persuasive nonsense when you're in a suicidal depression.<p>That's why suicidal depression is clearly, logically, and provably the impairment.<p>This is why, if you're even remotely contemplating suicide, you should ALWAYS, ALWAYS reach out and seek help. Because if you make a permanent decision, you will have been working off false information. As one of my favorite authors says, ""DEPRESSION LIES.""<p>In most cases, suicide is literally stupid.

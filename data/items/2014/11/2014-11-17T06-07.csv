You can already do a lot with the warm-standby and FDWs to do basic sharding, and they&#x27;re rolling in a lot more to 9.4 and 9.5. EnterpriseDB are the place to look for that to be made in to a full product.<p>Someday soon Postgres will have materialised views that auto update :)<p>However, as someone who works with MSSQL daily they&#x27;re still not comparable. I&#x27;d say Postgres is much nicer in development and I&#x27;d use it for my projects, but MSSQL has much more scalability without developer intervention.",1416207518

When you&#x27;re working with a client, most of whom are non-technical, you have to invest A LOT of time explaining things or re-doing things because it doesn&#x27;t work the way they imagined it in their head.<p>You don&#x27;t want to charge $50/hr then end up doing 2-3 hours extra work because the client uses IE7 and that was never part of the spec, but now you have to make it work with IE7. If you decide to charge them for the 2-3 hours of extra work, they are going to think you&#x27;re nickel and dimeing them. But if you charge them $200/hr upfront, you now have a buffer, so you just take it care, and it will be like you&#x27;re a wizard.<p>If it turns out the task was super easy, and the client is happy with the first revision, then you always have the option of reducing their bill. That is always better than increasing it.",1416207492
8617170,comment,8616952,8617033,0,0,lifeisstillgood,,,"An excellent question - and one that depends heavily on quality of management and perceived value.<p>Perceived value is the most common - no-one gets promoted on their past performance only on their expected performance. And so the difference between 50/hr and 200/hr is<p>Please note that 200/hr is not 10x 50/hr.  Either we are comparing top coders to minimum wage coders - of which I suspect there are few if any (in each &quot;locale&quot; not globally)
or we are actually capping top coders - this is very likely the explanation - to get to 500/hr or 5000/day or ~1million/year you need to be looking at equity level compensation.  And that&#x27;s a different issue.<p>Anyway where was I ? Yeah perceived value - this can always go up - but at a certain point you are no longer discussing per hour rates but project total rates and soon after the value becomes equity (I guess at around 1% o total perceived value)<p>And the time to have that conversation between hourly rate, project and equity? That depends on the cluefulness of management<p>I will suggest that climbing that compensation ladder from hourly rate to weekly rate  to project rate to equity is a focus on understandin business problems, and how tech can solve them, understanding team and coordination problems and selling the business solution.",1416207451

I think it&#x27;s difficult to evaluate whether the punishments are actually worthy of the abuses and it&#x27;s hard to know what the culture inside the NSA is, and it is also hard to know how widespread these abuses are and what affect they may have. They are examples of citizens being hurt by the programs, but agree that they are not (AFAWK) examples of systemic abuse.<p>I agree that the trading of nude pictures was asserted without evidence. I don&#x27;t know what internal documents they would keep on that, and Snowden has thus far been a very well-spoken and trustworthy source of information. I won&#x27;t claim it as a fact, but this sort of thing feeds into my last point from the last thread.<p>> every one of the 5 people listed by Greenwald has &quot;FBI&quot; in the responsible agency column<p>Left hand, right hand. The FBI, NSA, CIA, DOD, CSS, etc work with one another. Did the targeting utilize information or capabilities from the NSA?<p>I would be very interested if the Muslim leaders turned out to be connected to terrorism. They have not been arrested  if they are associated with terrorism - I&#x27;m not sure what to make of that besides they are just being watched for their prominent role as community leaders.<p>Overall point regarding Greenwald. He is an advocate for adversarial journalism. He will accuse the government of more than is certain in an attempt to provoke more information/clarification or force them to contradict themselves (as happened frequently at the start of the Snowden disclosures). People feel differently about this. I feel that it is necessary to combat the <i>other</i> side of journalism which trades media spin and coverage for access and sources and shows its belly to USG on the regular.<p>> Could you provide an example of this?<p>Yes. I&#x27;m going to copy a list from a Bruce Schneier post (<a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/10/iphone_encrypti_1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/10/iphone_encryp...</a>).<p>* The Greek cellphone intercept system was attacked by an unattributed group.<p>* The Italian cellphone intercept system was attacked similarly.<p>* China hacked into the Google&#x27;s US Government request system.<p>* The Syrian Electronic Army hacked into Microsoft&#x27;s FBI data request group.<p>* The US cellphone intercept system has been hacked by unattributed groups.<p>> And this is where I differ from most of the tech community. The solution isn&#x27;t to take away technical capability because it could be abused in the future, it&#x27;s to craft laws and policies to limit what the NSA can do with its technical capability and provide effective oversight. I don&#x27;t think anyone from even before the Snowden disclosures has argued for less oversight.<p>I think we&#x27;d agree here, but we&#x27;d likely disagree on what is reasonable. As things currently stand all data is sucked up and kept for longer than 5 years for later inspection. I think it&#x27;s reasonable for the intelligence community and law enforcement to track individual users, but I do not think it is a good idea to track everyone all the time and limit only by policy and paper what can be inspected.<p>I find that surveillance, be it by law enforcement, management at my company, my parents, or by a stalker to impede on my right to be secure in my person. I find that legal compulsion for some private individuals to keep files on other individuals is a circumvention of the spirit of the law - and in fact one applied by the Stasi.<p>The difference between in-house operations, hiring of private surveillance contractors and legal compulsion on private citizens is a blurry one to me. &quot;No means no.&quot;<p>I also find it &#x27;dirty&#x27; that the FISA court (<i>Foreign</i> Intelligence Surveillance Court) should have any say in domestic issues at all. They do not represent the Constitution nor are they are not subject to a system of checks and balances outside of self-policing (I am aware of the review panel suggestions regarding this).<p>> For some reason, though, everyone seems to assume that given the fact that the NSA has enormous technical resources for gathering foreign intelligence that could be abused<p>Provided fairly recent systemic abuses of intelligence power (COINTELPRO, etc) I don&#x27;t think these reactions are particularly absurd. Similar to how journalism may have to be partially adversarial, so does the relationship of men to their governments. Men need to ask what is being done, how it is being done and why it is being done. They need to demand honestly from their governments.<p>I would also ask that you reply to my last point regarding principles (the &#x27;organ donation&#x27; one).<p>Finally, there are some other examples of individuals who have been harmed.<p>The founder of Lavabit certainly was harmed for providing an email service - his business is now forever underwater and he was served to go to a jury-less court (with all the stress and financial requirements therein).<p>The CEO of Qwest (Nacchio) claims that (both personal and business-scale) leverage was used to force the direction of his company and resulted in his indictment and arrest.",1416206373

React is also much faster than Angular because of its virtual DOM patching technique.<p>But my favorite part of React so far is that view logic is grouped together with the views. This goes against the &quot;best practice&quot; of separating views and logic, but I think it makes navigating the codebase easier. You want to learn everything about how some custom view widget works? It&#x27;s all in one file, rather than spread across app/assets/javascripts/widget.js and app/views/widgets/widget.html.erb. No directory hopping needed to learn how the widget works.",1416206179

It drives you towards relatively simple charts that most people can understand and that&#x27;s a good thing because most of it&#x27;s users need significant guidance.

You can do some data exploration in Lyra, but a more constrained tool like tableau, spotfire, etc is easier for that purpose. Where Lyra is interesting IMO is in it&#x27;s ability to make more custom visualizations without coding - seems like using some kind of grammar of graphics definition under the hood.<p>Programming languages/frameworks like R, julia, pandas, d3 etc are of course the most flexible tools but they&#x27;ve got a high barrier of entry for a lot of folks who need to produce visualizations and explore data.

I set a number of goals for that course around learning, and forgot to set any around making the students happy.  I met the goals I set but...<p>I'm sure that if I had stayed in academia I would have sorted out those kinds of issues.  However it is clear to me that I'm much happier not being an academic.",1252731541

818654,comment,818532,818532,0,0,btilly,,,"I'm not sure what details to go into.  Being reminded of something as we're forgetting it pushes that thing into longer term memory.  It also internalizes the lesson.  This applies to both rote facts and intellectual ideas.  If you think of it as fact memorization, then you're missing the real power.<p>There are a lot of things you need to learn to master a mathematical topic.  You need to learn definitions and terminology.  You need to learn key theorems.  You should be able to apply procedures and derive formulas.  At a higher level you need to learn available proof techniques and the key ideas behind important proofs.<p>Of course learning these things intellectually is not quite sufficient.  You need skills as well.  However <i>failing</i> to learn these things will keep you from learning the topic.  And that is where most students fall down.<p>This is particularly true in subjects that build on themselves like mathematics.  If you missed an important point earlier, you may develop a bigger misconception about a current topic that will make it impossible to learn a future one.  Anyone who has tutored students should be aware of this.<p>As for what to review, students did not get the same questions over and over again.  Instead I gave them questions from the same section over and over again.  Since I only asked a few questions from the current day's section, there were always plenty of questions left to go back to for future homework sets.  As a bonus doing many kinds of questions at the same time makes connections obvious.  When a single homework set asks you to solve a set of equations, find a basis for a vector space, and invert a matrix, you see how they tie together.",1252731029

818647,comment,818209,818209,0,0,qeorge,,,"The author is missing some key knowledge about the industry. Selling analytics data could be a good fit for Twitter, but not for YouTube. Here's why:<p>1) YouTube's value is their user generated content. If the content goes, the site's value does too.<p>2) The highest-margin videos for YouTube are the most popular ones. These are often professionally produced and have distribution companies behind them. With UGC, the short tail subsidizes the long tail.<p>3) Professional video producers/distributors who consistently have popular videos already have sophisticated analytics software, often in house. They get their analytics data periodically and directly from Google, in a fairly raw format. Its way too much data to practically transfer through an API or web interface.<p>4) These users' financial incentive to produce the content is the revshare agreement they have with Google on the ads which run alongside their content. YouTube's volume currently makes them the best source of revenue for video makers.<p>So when you talk about selling* analytics data to the users, you're talking about selling a far inferior product for a paltry sum to a partner you already do orders of magnitude more commerce with each month.<p>Sure, you can argue that there might be regular folks who would be willing to pay for analytics data (that they're already getting free now), but I find that a bit naive. Either way, you don't want to waste your time trying to sell cheap software to small fish, and its definitely not worth $120B/yr.<p>*I'd be tempted to say extorting",1252730065

I'm talking about an algorithmic app that mines your emails and when you haven't replied to someone in say, a week, it will send you a reminder (i.e., ""You haven't talked to Steve in a week.

All this patch does is make a application.js.coffee instead of application.js, and add support for actually generating JS from this.<p>One of the recurring arguments I've seen is that this change will make it harder for people to get started with Rails.  I really don't understand how this is the case, because if you understand what public/javascripts is for and what javascript_include_tag does, you should also be able to write normal javascript all day long.  Hell, you don't even need that, adding your own HTML to include a script into the page works too (as always).  There is no need to write CoffeeScript if you don't want to/don't know how to; write all the js you want.<p>In reality, the only outcome of this will be more people discovering and learning CoffeeScript.

But it is a big difference, and it's not <i>just</i> syntactic.<p>First of all, I'd like to point out that syntax is <i>not</i> entirely irrelevant, at least not in the sense that CoffeeScript is ""just a weird syntax"" for JavaScript. Python decorators and list comprehensions are generally thought of as very nice features of the language, but they're really just a nice syntax for higher-order functions and iteration. That syntax makes a big difference. Just adding CoffeeScript's syntax for functions (including the do-operator) and the existential operator would noticeably reduce the size of most JavaScript code, without anything else.<p>But the difference isn't just syntactic. Here are a few semantic changes in CoffeeScript:<p>• Everything is an expression (a la Ruby)<p>• Equality is always strict<p>• A simplified class-based inheritance model on top of JavaScript's prototypal inheritance<p>• Switch is almost identical to Ruby's case expression rather than C's switch statement (i.e. clauses don't fall through and it's an expression rather than a statement), which makes it much more useful<p>I'll put it this way: I've been making websites since 1995 and am fairly proficient in JavaScript, but I have never really liked the language all that much. But CoffeeScript is a joy to use. I actually enjoy programming it, and it's just amazingly readable (both from the nicer syntax and the fact that CoffeeScript's sugar means you don't have to write as much code, and it's easier to understand five lines than 20, even if 15 of the 20 are boilerplate).",1302716401

If you're going to play employers to get more compensation, play <i>prospective</i> employers.<p>If you take a counter-offer from your current employer, they'll just put you on the shit list.  First to go in any sort of rough terrain.  First to get thrown under the bus if they need a body.  And most importantly: you'll have set a new normal for salary discussions.  That is, they'll feel they can simply say 'no' to every request until you're ready to leave again and then just match the offer.<p>They get to continue paying you X for however many months you give them; however many months it takes to find a job worth leaving for.  Then they coast in and match someone else's 1.2X offer, having enjoyed months and months of paying your old salary and playing all that stress and frustration and work of getting another offer against you.<p>And you can be certain they'll be playing every social/moral game to make you think you shouldn't get it along the way [1].<p>Further, you'll have damaged the nascent relationship with the would-be hiring company.  They invested nontrivial time and energy vetting and planning for you and will be miffed to find they were a pawn in a raise-play.  Sure, it's a valid business decision to change your mind and turn down an offer. But those individuals will remember and give you less preference in the future [2].  Taking a counter offer from your current employer just isn't seen the same way as taking a competing offer from a third firm.<p>By all means, use a counter-offer to negotiate for more from would-be new employers [3]. But don't take the counter offer and stay put. Unless you really love searching for jobs and can dispassionately go through the ""I'm going to quit."" stage and that doesn't negatively impact your co-workers [4].<p>[1] ""it's not a good time right now"".  ""the economy has everyone really tightening down"". ""no-one's getting a raise this year"".  ""i had to really push to get you guys a bonus, there's nothing left for salary"". etc.<p>[2] They'll also see you as one of those ""threatening to quit to get the best possible raise"" people. Which is a negative for any manager who'd rather not go through that drama.<p>[3] Keep in mind that asking for a bid against a counter-offer can blow up if you have no intention of taking the counter. If you push for them to bid and they decline, accepting that job marks you as a certain type of negotiator, which isn't helpful for you.  So if you <i>really</i> want to take this route, be prepared for the case where you need to actually accept the counter-offer, but continue your job search anyway.<p>[4] Remember that in any group-work situations, your co-workers will catch nontrivial shit when you move into the negotiating/quitting stage and they have to adjust and plan around your possibly not being there next month.  Which they'll be forced to do, because management will ensure they can most-effectively bargain against you.",1302714811

Cleveland-based performance engineering group, the Tesla Orchestra, launched the Open Spark Project last week, to let people around the world in on the fun of playing with giant musical bolts of electricity.  Already Girl Talk (pop mashup star) and others have signed up to enter songs into the project.  Thanks goes to Paul Buchheit (Google Employee #23 and inventor of GMail) for sponsoring all this excitement!<p><a href=""http://opensparkproject.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensparkproject.com</a><p>Entries accepted until May 2nd, and then on May 14th the musicians and fans around the world can watch a live video feed at opensparkproject.com as we play selections from the entries on our two giant musical tesla coils.  Musicians, come see your music turned into lightning!<p>Scientists and Engineers might wonder how the music is made.  A traditional (non musical) tesla coil involves a series of resonating circuits, building up voltage higher and higher until it discharges through a spark.  Part of that circuit is an air-gap switch that lets the first resonant circuit build up a high voltage before transmitting the energy to the second resonant circuit.<p>Now, replace that air-gap with a set of giant transistors, capable of sustaining thousands of amps of peak current, and you can now control when that spark can fly.  Our musical tesla coils resonate around 30khz, discharging sparks that are several meters long.  Using the transistors (called IGBTs) to turn that spark on and off at say, 440hz, will result in a 440hz tone, or A4 on your standard piano keyboard.  The same holds true for other frequencies, and so the tesla coils can reproduce any note on the piano.<p>Any noise that you can turn on and off can make music this way, and the DIY Maker community is full of musical projects that use printers, hard disk motors, you name it, all in the name of music.  We happen to like making music with giant bolts of lightning, and we hope you'll enjoy it too.",1302714697

2443138,comment,2442663,2443006,17,0,jashkenas,,,"Actually, CoffeeScript does generate more efficient code than the vast majority of JavaScript developers write by hand -- that's one of the goals. There are a couple reasons why this is the case, for example:<p>Do you tend to write your ""for"" loops with an ""each"" ? If you're using ""$.each"", ""_.each"", or ""[].forEach"", your loops are running a good bit slower than they could be. This CoffeeScript:<p><pre><code>    for item in list\n      item.marked = true\n</code></pre>\nGenerates this JavaScript:<p><pre><code>    var item, _i, _len;\n    for (_i = 0, _len = list.length; _i < _len; _i++) {\n      item = list[_i];\n      item.marked = true;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n... where you have a nice length-cached loop that runs about as fast as JavaScript is capable of.<p>Similarly, lots of JS developers avoid using prototypes because they're such a pain in the ass to type out manually -- preferring to manufacture objects via closures instead. This has a <i>huge</i> runtime and memory cost. CoffeeScript's ""class"" keyword makes it easy to work with JS prototypes effectively, without having to type out ""Klass.prototype.method = function ..."" all the time.",1302714124
2443137,comment,2442589,2442589,34,0,grellas,,,"This is a nice piece and Connie Bagley is a gifted lawyer and teacher who has for years now published a good legal guide for entrepreneurs along with Craig Dauchy of Cooley (we also had worked together at the same Big Law firm in the early 1980s).<p>A few observations:<p>1. Founders are much more aware of 83(b) elections today than they were in 2003 when this piece was done and failure to file these on time is much less a problem today than it was then.<p>2. The biggest problem by far among early-stage founders that is not mentioned here is failure to assign IP into the company at the time of formation when shares are issued. This is commonly overlooked when founders take a do-it-yourself approach. Normally, it is easily cleaned up but, in cases where disputes have arisen, it is a painful and expensive problem to deal with.<p>3. I would add as well trying to ""do it yourself"" without even consulting with a good lawyer to get strategic guidance. This can lead to problems that are easily avoided at small cost by consulting up-front with a lawyer, even if you intend to defer hiring a firm in the earliest stages (see, e.g., for an example of what can go wrong as a founder candidly discusses why ""incorporating my startup [in Delaware] was my worst mistake"": <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2399139"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2399139</a>).<p>As a point of comparison, here is a link to a similar list (equally good) done by Scott Walker and posted on HN a while back: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1418300"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1418300</a> (as to which I made a detailed comment touching on LLCs, Delaware, vesting, and tax).<p>In general, founders are much more savvy about legal startup issues today than when this piece was written but it is always helpful to review the major issues as a double-check when starting.",1302714117

Using Closure Compiler, you are forced to document your code with their enhanced version of jsDocs, so CC will make sure that if your method returns null or a list of strings, that anywhere that method is used, you don't try to treat the returned value as a string or object, for instance.<p>How does coffee script play with existing object oriented JS libraries? Is there compile-time type checking?",1302714072

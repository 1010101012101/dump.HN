Summer schools, maybe, which could create ad-hoc communities carrying skills back to their home institutions?<p>As to the temporal bias in literature awareness: it's sort of unavoidable in any research area of decent size.  The scope of the literature is simply too enormous.  Certain key papers get codified as canon and others are lost in the fog.

2392356,story,,,1,0,Reedge,"Google +1, Facebook Like and Places are the New Targeting Opt-Ins",,"The new marketing opportunities for website owners are the new social tools that everyone is using. Thanks to Google +1, Facebook Like, Check-ins from Google, Facebook, Gowalla and Foursquare can all be equally strong as an opt-in for a newsletter. So it seems leaving the market self regulation is taking a natural course and national interference is not needed.<p>Most people outside the tech space do not realize that with a simple Facebook Like or Check-in your giving access to you public profile and all settings your sharing. Website owners can use this information by taking a peek in Facebook Graph API http://developers.facebook.com/docs/api and search specific status update (or keywords) or check-ins for example. It is a very interesting way to build tools on top of these APIs given by Facebook, the several places/check-in apps and hopefully Google +1 API.<p>For example check out what youre sharing on Facebook by going to <a href=""http://zesty.ca/facebook/"">http://zesty.ca/facebook/</a>, you can use your Facebook id or email to find how open you are. Most of use in the tech-space is more informed then the other 550 million users of Facebook so its a very interesting opportunity to connect tools like ours to Facebook for example.<p>Imagine that you could actually start some sort of drip marketing based on nothing more than the Facebook Like your page or App received. It would not be wise to start posting on someones wall or push a tweet. But a more subtle as checking if a person check-in in the past, define the sex, age-group, mentions of your product in status updates or location of the person and storing that users profile in a specific segment in Reedge. You could then target these people with a more personal drip-approach every time they come back.<p>For example Visitor A, checks-in at 9 PM, using Foursquare and the day after clicks the Facebook Like button on you restaurant page or mobile app (Facebook Graph API tell us she is female 30-35 years old).  This makes her fall into the segment of Clients Female Check-in & Facebook Like. You did not get her email yet, but this should be enough to start targeting when she comes back to one of your sites her using a more personal homepage targeted on returning female clients.<p>Its all a big theory; we have not made this yet. Buts its an intriguing idea to use the Facebook Like and other social APIs to build an opt-in profile of a person that travels along with them across you sites. Maybe not everything is possible and I would have to check all terms of the API but my best guess is that building an opt-in profile using the social buttons on your site is something that is very close to reality.<p>Would you do this as a company to increase your conversion?

And frankly it worked great when i am testing the feature on my dev macbook with just a couple of 1000's of users. But when i started testing it on our server loading entire legacy data redis ended up taking more than 6GB of RAM for abt half a million users.<p>i told myself to just plan for 2 times our current traffic and then later on think of a better solution(best thing wud be to plan for 5-10 times your current traffic) and told my CEO that we might have to bump up RAM on the redis machine to 32 or 64 GB in the future(the easiest way but not an elegant way to solve the problem is throw more resources). Also mind that you need atleast 2 such machines to provide failover. i just hoped salvatore(a great guy BTW) would release a cluster solution for redis and will save me.<p>While testing the feed we came to know we needed to add more such actions from the user and every time you add a new type of action for every user you are looking at increasing the memory of Redis process by substancial amount. you will run out of memory faster than you have planned. i thought VM is the solution to all of this as user feeds typically use only latest data and the entire feed doesn't need to be in the memory. But quite frankly VM has it's own set of problems -- <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/redis-db/browse_thread/thread/6534a6fb5c3ee804"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/redis-db/browse_thread/thread...</a>.<p>Not telling that your solution isn't good. Just wanted to warn you about some potential problems from experience of trying out your solution. Finally i am using cassandra for news feed. Working great as of now. At least much better than  my experience with implementing the same with redis. The major problem with cassandra as of now is implementing pagination and counting. distributed counters are coming in 0.8 . pagination is still a major problem though. But for news feed you might not need pagination. providing a load more button as facebook and twitter does should be good enough.<p>Hope it helps.",1301589953

The issue is that people don't know how much high frequency traders actually make per contract. The amount is pretty small (on average). Typically, each trade takes on ""bite-sized"" risk and expects ""bite-sized"" returns. Do that thousands of times a day, and your bite-sized returns grow to something reasonable, but not ridiculous. Certainly, it's not on the order of how much other forms of proprietary trading make.<p>I think the other issue is that people don't understand that all traders, HFT or not, take on risk when they enter a trade.

An example: suppose that you set name=foo in record A1, which is part of entity group A.  If you then retrieve record A1, that's an operation on entity group A, so you're guaranteed to see name=foo.  But if you perform a global query for all records with name == foo, that's an operation on an index, which is outside the entity group and so is not mediated by the entity group's Paxos log.  Therefore, your query might not return A1.  The index is ""eventually"" consistent -- it's guaranteed that, eventually, all indexes will be updated.

Like (hopefully) the program the bank uses to track account balance.<p>However, a seemingly much easier problem (the Halting Problem [1]) is undecidable in the <i>general</i> case. One can find out at least some properties of some programs some of the time with certainty (modulo mundane mistakes). But one cannot find all the properties of all the programs all of the time.<p>Now perhaps programming isn't the best model of all human activities, but! If we were to narrow down the discussion to research on Computer Science alone -- it is proved (via the Halting Problem), that you can't know all the outcomes of every possible programs ahead of the time. Which means, research on some (possibly valuable) programs can't be graded with 100% certainty ahead of the time, because there is no way of knowing all the properties of a program in advance.<p>Back to the original topic, my point was -- if somebody invested effort into (honest, rigorous) research, it should not be derided, ever, as it may find unexpected, valuable uses. I don't claim anything about research pointed towards commercial (or otherwise) goals, except the general ``it's important, too -- but it's is not the only way we should follow''.<p>Back to the matter of predicting: I am convinced, in general, you can't predict some of the outcomes of research -- and some applications of the results. Moreover, I believe that among what can't be predicted, are many of the innovations and discoveries.<p>Now economic predictions (this will sell/this won't sell) are wrong some of the time. To prevent a wrong prediction from blocking research, there is usually pool of money for `blue-sky research', generally realized as countries sponsoring academiae, and individuals financing research out of own pocket.<p>It may be very hard to estimate effects of mis-predictions on research, due to this continuous financing -- financing that's independent of whether there is a clear, short-term goal for the research.<p>EDIT:
the Rice's theorem, posted by sid0 [2], is a much better example.<p>EDIT2:
as a funny corollary to the Halting Problem, in some cases even running the program won't give you a definite answer -- the program may go on endlessly. Running the program is not a fool-proof solution, thus not a general solution.<p>It follows your discussant was proven wrong (not completely right, to be exact) preemptively -- by Turing's proof of undecidability of the Halting Problem ;-)<p>----<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2392186"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2392186</a>",1301588169

Later, with my second book, I decided to effectively self-publish, for two reasons: 1) the money is better and 2) I wanted to be able to update my books whenever I had something to say. My first book, which was published in 2005, hasn't been updated once, even though I have hundreds of notes on the margins of my own copy. Talk about frustrating.<p>The problem is that self publishing is a lot of work if you want to do it properly. It requires a large up-front investment, which is difficult to justify if you're only going to write a book or two. I spent months learning the publishing business, building the processes and the software. To support my continuous publishing ideas, I built a fully-automated workflow based around DocBook, from which I produce print, screen, and various other digital formats. While I enjoyed all of it, most people wouldn't. I was also lucky to have the support of my wife, who is actually managing the company, as well as the sales and marketing activities.<p>Experiencing all this, we are now transforming our publishing company to to provide low-cost support to authors who wish to keep control and a big chunk of their royalties, but also to focus on writing (rather than publishing and the other repetitive activities).

Perhaps - they'd be the best to know because they've been sued more times than anyone. I love Google, use all their products because they are the best - but as 100's of articles on HN have illustrated --> Bing is JUST as good as Google, arguably the search results are not that much different --> everyone uses Google because it's where EVERYTHING you use is located and Bing doesn't offer anything ""better"" than Google - so why change ?<p>This ""lax"" attitude is exactly what creates monopolies and exactly what stifles competition. If Google have 99% of the search market - nothing is ""pushing them"" to innovate. Maybe I would use Bing more if Hotmail didn't suck ?

How are data practices maintained and what is Google doing with the enormous amount of data it gathers ? Relevant questions.

At the time I decided not to pursue it at all, but that may be an approach to take with small businesses that can't afford to pay outright for custom software or systems.",1301587827

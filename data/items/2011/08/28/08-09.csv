That way, when your eyes try to focus on the virtual object's virtual distance, that is the optical distance at which the screen will be sharp.",1314521913

2933609,comment,2933049,2933275,0,0,Adrock,,,"Peers?  He ends by comparing Jobs to oil executives.  Oil companies are ridiculously subsidized by the US government in many ways, the most egregious being the use of the military to secure major pipelines at the cost of trillions of dollars and many lives.  Those subsidies end up not-so-indirectly as the compensation for said executives.  Apple is a company that takes raw materials and ideas and manufactures some of the most desirable products in the world.  If everyone wants to give him their money of their own free will, what's the problem?  Oil companies don't give you a choice.  Even before purchasing a single drop of gas, each American has literally given them tens of thousands of dollars by way of taxes and the deficit.  They are vilified for a reason.  Just because they have similar orders of magnitude of money doesn't mean that the same moral judgements need to be made of them.<p>The whole article is a disingenuous troll piece.<p>Another example is the initial appeal to the universal hatred of software patents.  Yes, IP laws are horrible when it comes to software, but it is ridiculous to claim that Apple's riches are dependent on them.  The author is grasping to associate Jobs with the standard ""evils.""",1314521144
2933608,comment,2925609,2926686,1,0,Yoric,,,"<i>I've never seen the model work before where you ""don't even need to think about what's running on the client or server."" I like features like sharing code (same language) and easy transport (serializable data structures), but frameworks that blur the client/server distinction usually download all of your code, or none of it, or little snippets on demand, or some other strategy that's worse than a manual distinction.</i><p>There are two things here. For prototyping, Opa will automatically decide what goes to the client and what goes to the server. We are very much aware that this may not yield the best performance. So, when you move from prototyping to optimization, using your knowledge of the application security policy, you can add security hints that the compiler will use to optimize client-server placement, knowing that this does not break the policy. And finally, if you want even better control, you can annotate any piece of code to instruct the compiler to place it on the client, or on the server, or both. In any case, the compiler will inform you if the set of constraints you put has no solution.<p><i>Tons of dependencies (a personal gripe). Coming from the Java world, where lots of things like reading images are built-in, it's comical to see that Opa requires Java, AND libjpeg and a dozen other things (it doesn't actually run on the JVM I don't think).</i><p>I concur that the dependencies are a (minor) annoyance. Just one point: Java is used only to build Opa from source. More precisely, during Opa compilation, we run the (very nice) Java-based Google Closure Compiler as a measure of the quality of our JavaScript libraries. If I recall correctly, that build step is optional, too.",1314521052
2933607,comment,2932956,2932956,27,0,buro9,,,"Back in 1997 when I and three others ran a record label called Jeepster, we had a few great bands on our label: Belle & Sebastian, Salako and Snow Patrol. (OK, Snow Patrol were less than great then, and perhaps now.)<p>One of the things I figured I should make was a web site in which fans were able to communicate with each other, the theory was simply that:<p>1) If fans kept the interest high between releases they'd be there still when we came with a new release<p>2) If someone was looking for a lyric or something they'd heard and we helped them find it, we might convert a stray passer-by into a fan<p>So I built something that you'd now call a crowd-sourcing site.<p>For every track, people could submit:<p>* Lyrics<p>* Mis-hearings<p>* Personal memories the lyrics evoke<p>* Interpretations/Understanding of the Lyrics<p>* Tablature for different instruments<p>All of which were votable so that the best tablature rose to the top, but others (perhaps harder ones) were still available.<p>It was highly compelling, you came for the lyrics but stayed for the personal memories and insight.<p>As a label we felt it was hugely successful. It definitely paid back in keeping the interest of fans, increasing that interest and creating new fans.<p>It worked so well that NME nominated us for best web site in their awards ceremony in early 2000 because they'd never seen a site in which the content was mostly created by fans and that the fans loved.<p>I left the label in 2000 to do other things. The system ticked over for a while, but the label never replaced me with another technically inclined person and when they wanted to change the styling of the song system they broke the PERL script and left it broke before taking it offline. Such a shame really.<p>Since then, whenever I look up lyrics, I've wondered why there isn't a comprehensive crowd-sourcing of all of the information around a song in the same vein that I did it, but including things like when it's been performed live or recorded in radio sessions. A real database about a song, what it means, who's covered it, how to play it, what it means.<p>The business model would be to sell stuff related to the song, affiliate fees for MP3 downloads and CD sales, affiliate link for the purchase of the official tablature books. Keep it simple, and keep adverts off of it. A wikipedia solely for songs and everything about a song.<p>The cost per transaction and storage is incredibly low as it's just text. And you could probably negotiate with publishing companies as right now they don't even get credit for this stuff let alone increased opportunity to sell what they have.<p>The PERL script in 1997 wasn't more than a simple thing that used flat files as a database for the 200+ tracks we'd released to then. Nowadays, for the complexity we're talking about, a weekend project in Django would suffice as a first pass. The hardest thing is just talking to the publishers, but truly, it's not as hard as some people imagine, there are fewer publishers than there are record labels.",1314520912

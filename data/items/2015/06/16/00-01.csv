We have content providers, that choose a business model that allows them to provide content without requiring payment as long as there is advertising.  We then have consumers taking this content and automatically removing said advertisements.  When the terms of a deal are seen as disadvantageous, it&#x27;s the right of either party to not enter into that transaction.  It is not their right to renege on their side of the transaction while receiving the benefit from the other party.<p>I understand many people do not see this as a contract between the consumer and the content provider.

Paywalls were already suggested, and this subthread was talking about the problems of paywalls — e.g. they segment the Internet into inaccessible walled gardens, they&#x27;re inconvenient, they exclude a large chunk of the world&#x27;s population, they kill your readership. Somebody suggested that he thought the best approach was to just do ads, and if you really can&#x27;t stand having your ads blocked, just block users who are running ad blockers. Then it was pointed out that this is a Sisyphean task, and you replied talking about paywalls as the solution. So bringing up paywalls doesn&#x27;t really seem to have a point here, unless you have a new insight into how to get around their many and numerous drawbacks.",1434416077
9723177,comment,9721212,9721419,0,0,bhauer,,,"Whenever the cloud fails to live up to its popular reputation as bulletproof and resilient, I cannot resist suggesting that the &quot;cloud&quot; as it exists today distracts us from alternative forms of computing that I feel would be superior.  I&#x27;ve routinely proposed a theoretical I call personal application omnipresence or PAO [1], wherein user applications run on a personal application server and are made available to all devices via multiple views (in a manner similar to responsive web design).<p>Ultimately, I think a principle failure of modern computing is our collective inability to deliver secure, private networks (what we currently call &quot;VPNs&quot;) in a form that is easily digestible by laypeople—or even semi-technical people, for that matter.  With today&#x27;s mess, configuring a VPN properly takes an enormous amount of attention to detail.  VPN technologies are mired with a proprietary and confusing lexicon alongside a continent-sized minefield of potential configuration errors.  Of all the R&D being sunk into the cloud, I am not aware of significant R&D investment in making personal private networks that are trustworthy and easily configured.<p>The inability to give individuals and families omnipresent private networks makes their multi-device lifestyles an all-too-convenient target for the facile omnipresence of today&#x27;s plain cloud.  The plain cloud offers omnipresence while forcing acquiescence of privacy, self-control, and even knowledge of how your data and information about your actions is being used.<p>It <i>also</i> centralizes sensitive data into especially juicy targets like Lastpass.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting a distributed model is definitely more secure, but a plurality of implementation approaches, perimeter firewalls, and the tiny size of individual networks makes each target less interesting.<p>For the time being, I use a Keepass database on a file server I operate that I reach via an IPSec VPN from all of my devices.  I am not a network professional, so my IPSec VPN may have been configured improperly, but I&#x27;ve tried to follow best practices.  What I really want—to reiterate—is a high-quality, simple (not stupid but feature-constrained) private network that our proverbial parents could use.  That is always on, from all devices I use, providing a secure channel to communicate with <i>my data</i> on <i>my file server</i> anywhere.<p>What I have, however, is the monster that is IPSec which forces me to think about concepts like SA lifetime, IKE, Key Groups, and certificates.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tiamat.tsotech.com/pao"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiamat.tsotech.com/pao</a>",1434416074

9723078,comment,9718625,9722379,0,0,justabystander,,,"> looks an awful lot like bad-mouthed rumours<p>Really? So if we look at the Git repo commit history, we&#x27;ll see the transition commit on April 1st (<a href=""https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/commit/bc4b7fc4ea17c8221c9c3b25aa621231c443d3e8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/commit/bc4b7fc4ea17c8...</a>). I&#x27;m pretty sure we can consider his first commit as demonstrating his intentions if it departs significantly from previous project direction. And it does - the very first commit after the transition was to start soliciting donations (<a href=""https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/commit/f256801344a5178261cad5130a7f4be1ec061343"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/commit/f256801344a517...</a>). Git repositories have some reviewable history to them, but I guess that&#x27;s all just rumours, right?<p>> Seeking for donations is especially a good idea since the original developer left the project because it was too much work -> counteract that work with money.<p>Perhaps. But in that same flurry of commits on his first day of project ownership, he linked to a personal donation account (<a href=""https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/commit/31a4a522814f06671e7dfe7bd6950c0ce2c5bbbb#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/commit/31a4a522814f06...</a>). All that&#x27;s said on that page (<a href=""https://gratipay.com/~chrisaljoudi/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gratipay.com/~chrisaljoudi/</a>) is that he works on uBlock. Part of the drama was that it previously implied more than just working on it - it was <i>his</i>. His wording has since given more recognition to the contributions of others, thankfully. But Day 1 - he&#x27;s looking for donations, and its his project. Perhaps not terrible on any other day. But taking an open and free project, slapping personal donation buttons all over it, and removing attribution from other developers by manually committing changes (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9449876"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9449876</a>) - this behavior turned a lot of people off to his project and leadership. He&#x27;s since talked about sharing those donations, which I think is good. I still think it would be better to not solicit them, but I don&#x27;t personally value his contributions that highly any more. That&#x27;s probably my own bias.<p>> <a href=""https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock</a> mentions gorhill and ublock origin in a positive way<p>Those changes are more recent, and came after a lot of public criticism. We can see from the commits that those came in a month and a half after the transition (<a href=""https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/commit/823778274bfd4769af668c9fa5fbc95902680a2c#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/commit/823778274bfd47...</a>). Roughly 2-3 weeks after the video you linked. His first approach was publicity, and then he took a less aggressive approach. Let&#x27;s not whitewash things when commit history shows that it&#x27;s only 19 commits back (three of those from other people) from the current mainline on Jun 7th. Normal procedure when taking over project maintainership is to maintain - not reinvent the image for donations.<p>I personally think he saw the opportunity to get some cash for not a whole lot of work, which is a really attractive offer as a high school student. I don&#x27;t think it was <i>malicious</i>, but I also don&#x27;t think it was appropriate behavior to take something that was created for free to help others and <i>personally</i> monetize it the moment you got some authority over it. He found out that these things are considered unethical and changed. That&#x27;s good - and we don&#x27;t have to lynch him. High school kids do dumber things, and there&#x27;s still room to learn and grow. But they&#x27;re not rumours - these things actually happened.<p>There&#x27;s a reason people prefer the the gorhill fork. I don&#x27;t think Ajouldi&#x27;s a bad kid, but I don&#x27;t fault people for not trusting him after his very public missteps. I think he&#x27;ll do much better things in the future - and I think part of that is him directly experiencing the fallout of a poor decision before he&#x27;s gotten a career that could be affected by it. I won&#x27;t crucify him, but I won&#x27;t pretend he never did anything wrong just because he apologized.",1434414040

Developing those features would significantly impair other parts of the project.<p>For example, the problem might be &quot;What if our database becomes overloaded one day?&quot;  Choosing to implement, say, sharding, could lead to an over-engineered system which gets in the way of solving the many different future performance problems that could crop up.<p>I think it&#x27;s quite reasonable to use the term &quot;over-engineering&quot; in this sort of situation.",1434413108

Yet somehow I (any everyone I work with, and have worked with over the past 25 years) still works in a shell daily. I don&#x27;t understand how someone on the technical end of running large internet services could avoid it.<p>Sure, GUI tools have crept in here and there. And I understand that some toolchains mandate all-singing, all-dancing IDEs. I don&#x27;t work in those areas (the closest I&#x27;ve come was doing Java work for about five years and I still lived in vi, because Eclipse makes me homicidal). And I still see our iOS developers using `find&#x27; and `sed&#x27;.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say GUIs can&#x27;t improve on the command line for some things. For example, the MacOS tool &quot;A Better Finder Rename&quot; (despite its inability to rename itself something less clunky) is a great tool for mass-renaming, e.g., photos. I have written such critters before as shell/perl/python scripts, but pulling EXIF data and renaming files programmatically is ticky and potentially destructive enough that I tend to write it once and then not modify it unless it breaks. The GUI preview and regex capture display makes this much less annoying.",1434412945

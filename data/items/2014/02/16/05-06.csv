If it&#x27;s true that you&#x27;re not finding out about interesting people before they die, it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re not looking. Zina&#x27;s website was there before her death right? Would it have gained as much appeal and attention without the touch of tragedy? Probably not, but only because it&#x27;s &quot;just another artist&quot;.

When he killed himself, though, that got him to the top of HN a few times. But you could have looked him up a week before, and his interesting code and research would have still been there. This probably holds true for a lot of people - if one of the top HN comment-writers eats a cyanide pill tonight, would you not expect headline news tomorrow?<p>The only real depressing part is that people are dying.<p>If you&#x27;re really depressed about only hearing about such people in the nice summaries written up after they die, then go seek out living people doing cool stuff today!",1392529662

I last remember the latter effect in the title text of Slate articles (viewed on Android) that shows in a position:fixed bar after one scrolls down; think I&#x27;ve also seen it in titles on The Verge (viewed on Ubuntu).

A no brainer installation, a familiar query syntax and a small api make it easy to pick up even if you have never experienced a graph db before.<p>3. It has clients in popular languages + an http api. I see that there is no client for erlang yet so I am planning to write a small http erlang client for it.<p>4. The default console client that orient ships with is very easy to use.<p>That is about it for the moment. I can&#x27;t believe I missed this database before.

7246755,comment,7239407,7246711,3,0,thedufer,,,"> No null references, for example?<p>We write in CoffeeScript, where a null reference check is so astonishingly easy to write that you use them everywhere you might get a null.  I&#x27;m not sure what other exceptions you&#x27;re seeing.  We do basically no math, so /0 errors aren&#x27;t a problem.<p>> For example, I don&#x27;t know why you say that the async library couldn&#x27;t try-catch every place that an exception might occur<p>Let&#x27;s build a typical function you might pass to async:<p>function(next) {\n  request.get(url, function(err, data) {\n    JSON.parse(data);\n  }\n}<p>Let&#x27;s assume the server doesn&#x27;t serve JSON like we expect - so JSON.parse throws an exception.  The only thing async could have wrapped in a try/catch is the main function, but we&#x27;ve fired off a request and then the call stack wrapped up, including the try/catch.  Next, an event occurs that calls our callbacks, not going through async at all.  That&#x27;s where the exception occurs.  The stack trace generated by that exception doesn&#x27;t contain any code in the async lib, so it can&#x27;t possibly have a try/catch active.<p>Domains are a way of fixing this.  You create a Domain and bind callbacks to it - if that callback throws an exception, the Domain instead emits an error event.",1392529007

I mean, if you tie the whole system together such that if you simply switch the smallest of switches from 0 to 1 that sends out desired changes rippling out through the rest of the system, it wouldn&#x27;t matter how much mass it took.<p>Why does it have to take a lot of mass to simulate a person - does what&#x27;s outside necessarily have to be more complex than what&#x27;s on the inside?",1392527476

If you had, you would have seen that I already pointed out that there are big differences between the two cases, and that I noted two of the more significant differences, both of which you repeat in your list.  Furthermore, the last sentence of my comment already recognizes that the difference in response may be attributable to differences between the cases, rather than other factors.  So what are you criticizing?<p>Nevertheless, I do think that the idea that these cases are completely unrelated is off the mark.  The most significant PR challenge that Reif has faced in his tenure has been the Aaron Swartz case, and his response to that case has been roundly criticized in the national press (albeit most vociferously by people close to Aaron).<p>Regardless of what <i>you</i> think of MIT&#x27;s response in Aaron Swartz&#x27;s case, you must recognize Reif would be remiss not to recognize the parallels between the two cases: parallels between the narratives, parallels in how MIT community members (and the hacker community generally) have reacted to the narratives, parallels in how the press will likely report on both cases.  From a PR perspective, this story can easily become a continuation of the Aaron Swartz affair, if MIT is not careful.<p>This letter may not be a cynically calculated PR response meant to deflect the kind of criticism MIT suffered after the Aaron Swartz tragedy, but it can nonetheless be assessed in relation to MIT&#x27;s response to Aaron&#x27;s arrest.  At minimum, this letter is a recognition that a university <i>can</i> insert itself between prosecutors and students, and stand up for its community principals when they are under assault.<p>Supporters of Aaron Swartz have been looking for precisely that from MIT for quite some time.",1392527159

Sure refusing these types of interviews means you won&#x27;t be considered for certain jobs at certain companies but do you really want to work for a company that is so foolish as to run candidates through a series of standardized tests and ask them to do a bunch of tasks under a microscope that are completely unrelated to the job you&#x27;d be performing? A lot of the companies that employ these ridiculous interview tactics are staffed by people who have deluded themselves into believing that their lightly used web app requires elite programmers.<p>There are plenty of good opportunities for half decent devs at companies not staffed by people who want you to spend 8 hours whiteboarding algorithms but won&#x27;t take time out of their day to read your resume, review your code samples and ask you relevant questions about your experience.",1392526915

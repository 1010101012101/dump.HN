The problem for Google with real names was people who didn&#x27;t want to be associated with their real names and already were deeply dependent on Google for the their phone / email. I recall the transgender outing articles [1].

Further, getting the system font is something that CSS should be able to know about without the aid of JavaScript; there are lots of simple forms and data entry &quot;applications&quot; that don&#x27;t use any JavaScript (nor should they) and would benefit from a better presentation. Writing a native application for any platform, I want to get the system font, and not have to know or assume any qualities of what that font is.  With typical native applications, the default font is intrinsic in the UI widgets your using, so you don&#x27;t have to think about it.  With the web, typically the default font is a &quot;document font&quot; and not the UI widget font, so you need to be able to have some sort of mechanism beyond the default font in order to get the system UI font.",1438022944

The last processor, the quad-core VX11/H, was in 2012 and one of a few on 40nm. Does a lot of stuff for a x86 SOC in 5.8W (max). Their last board design was 2014. So, they&#x27;re still chugging along. Most likely two things: slowly moving their I.P. to costly 40nm and developing new ones; moving slower in general because of terrible, financial situation IIRC. In long run, they&#x27;ll probably die because they tried to compete in x86 and even mighty AMD with their volume & engineers haven&#x27;t pulled that off.<p>Far as low power, not everybody is focusing on <i>x86-compatible</i>, low-power chips these days. I only know three vendors: Intel, AMD, and VIA. So, it&#x27;s that stuff that&#x27;s relevant to a VIA comparison if we&#x27;re talking x86 and legacy software/OS needing it. Students in labs throw together low-power, ARM/MIPS clones as a side effect of their simplicity and process node. x86 is so complicated that it took smart, HW engineers to do that with only a few companies trying and most gone. It&#x27;s again why I&#x27;m anti-x86: entirely too complicated compared to multi-core RISC with hard-wired accelerators.

I don&#x27;t see any reason that what version of Debian you use should lock you into a default version of Erlang, instead of simply letting a user install whatever version of Erlang they need quickly and easily. For all the bleating during the systemd flame war about how Debian and Linux is about choice, it&#x27;s a very constrained form of choice.<p>EDIT: Well, that&#x27;s not true, I see the reason -- Linux isn&#x27;t an OS so much as it is a family of OSes that are assembled from a lot of independently developed projects and are loosely compatible with each other, so the reason you need a Debian-specific version of Erlang is because Debian isn&#x27;t quite the same as Arch or Fedora or what have you. I just don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s such a great reason that users should just accept that it&#x27;ll never get better.",1438021889

I taped aluminum foil over my bedroom windows and wore earplugs so I could sleep at any hour. I lived at a high latitude, about 60, in a city that received about 100 inches of rain per year.<p>During that winter I literally did not see the sun for several months. On many days I would try desperately to get out of bed before the sun sunk behind the mountains in the early afternoon, but I was constantly sleep deprived and I lacked the willpower. Every afternoon was a bitter disappointment when I slept through sunset, and in the morning between a graveyard shift that ended at 7am or later, and a swing that started at 3pm, insomnia would segue into panic as I watched the clock tick past 10 and 11 am, and thought of my next shift starting in 4 hours. At that point I would be reduced to drinking and/or &quot;borrowing&quot; some pills from a friend, setting three alarm clocks, and showing up with a hangover, which was bad for productivity, but less debilitating then no sleep at all.<p>It was generally understood that graveyard shift guys got a little more slack about being late now and then, but calling in &quot;sick&quot; for a whole shift was not tolerated. My boss kept telling me that he would put me on full time graveyard, and stop making me cover day shifts (and also take me off the “training wage”) any day now, but the day never came.<p>I gained 20 pounds in 9 mounts. I became profoundly addicted to nicotine patches because I didn&#x27;t have time to smoke, and didn&#x27;t have the willpower or lifestyle health to quit. But the most pernicious effects were on my judgment, mood, and executive abilities. It&#x27;s almost impossible to create and execute long term plans when you are exhausted all the time, can&#x27;t think clearly and all of the will power you can muster is devoted to not over-sleeping through your obligations. I was a full time student at the beginning of this, with the intention of completing a CS degree but I had trouble focusing on the work.<p>As I write this now, it sounds melodramatic, but I thought at the time that it wasn&#x27;t a big deal and I just needed to “tough it out” to work my way through college. In retrospect, I can see that routine insomnia and panic are not normal, that I made all kinds of bizarrely bad decisions that I only noticed later, and did a shitty job at school. It was only possible to sustain that lifestyle because I lived with my parents, who took care of all the household responsibilities while I was at work or school or sleeping through alarms, and because I mortgaged my health.<p>Finally, when it came time to register for a fall semester my boss put off a conversation about scheduling for so long that I registered for a full load of day classes without his permission rather than miss the registration deadline. I showed him my schedule and told him that if he couldn&#x27;t accommodate it and also stop putting me on graveyard shifts, I would have to look for work somewhere else. He relented, rather than fire me. After that, I quit nicotine, started running, lost 30 pounds, and started spending more time outside. It almost seemed easy once I was sleeping 8 hours every night (Ok, except for quitting nicotine). I also started noticing all the bad decisions I had made once I could think clearly enough not to put off hard problems.<p>I think if I had been 53 instead of 23 it might have actually killed me. Just don&#x27;t do it.<p>If you do it anyway, please be realistic by discounting your wage against harm to your health and judgment, and to your future earnings. For example, I set back my college career by doing this.\nInsist on a consistent schedule, and don&#x27;t be afraid to threaten to quit to get it. It doesn&#x27;t need to be a bluff because the opportunity cost of not sleeping is so high; your net wealth will probably increase either way in the long run, even if you do get fired.<p>Also I think the harm can be partly remediated with a gym membership. If you can&#x27;t exercise outside during daylight, this is far better then nothing. Sleep deprivation is shown to cause weight gain and to have a detrimental effect on mood, so exercise is a good way to partially compensate, but it&#x27;s sort of a chicken and egg kind of problem because adequate sleep and a consistent sleep rhythm are prerequisites to exercise, at least for me. I tried to do it without those preconditions, but I lacked the willpower to consistently exercise while exhausted.<p>Ultimately, I would not consider night shifts again unless I were guaranteed 1) a near term end date, 2) a consistent schedule, and 3) a VERY large wage premium that served a life changing goal.",1438020914

Those who do are few of the big traditional banks, but mostly newer disruptive banks, such as those started by retail chains.<p>&quot;every single customer that comes in requires services from a human...&quot;<p>That&#x27;s only if there are physical branches! I&#x27;m almost starting to think you think I&#x27;m making stuff up. So let me explain (this is Sweden by the way):<p>Many banks here don&#x27;t have physical offices at all, or just provide banking services through existing infrastructure (some large retail chains, for example IKEA and our largest grocery chain). All banks, but especially the large commercial banks with physical branches charge <i>huge</i> fees for the manual transactions (paying a bill in a physical branch can be $5-$15), as to discourage manual service. Only elderly people use manual bank services these days and physical branches closed in large numbers starting 15 years ago, since most banking moved to the Internet. I haven&#x27;t used a manual banking service (paid a bill, cashed a check, deposited cash...) in ten years.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the marginal costs of audits, insurances and so on are for our banks, but apparently lower than the expected income from a customer. You know how McDonalds sell you a $1 item at a loss just to get you in the door (a &quot;loss leader&quot;)? - this could well be a case of that, and that would make a lot of sense. As everyone is always paid salary to a bank account here, I imagine the average customer can be pretty attractive; Everyone with a legal employment of any kind will have money in their accounts. The bank just needs to believe that the expected income of a new customer is greater than the marginal costs. I do believe banks here have very nearly zero marginal cost for a customer that opens an account themselves using electronic ID, and never uses a physical branch. I also think the expected future profit from a customer can be pretty big because of how the economy works with high employment and all salaries paid to bank accounts.",1438020789

Solar doesn&#x27;t cut it at least with our battery technology and our climate (some parts of the US only get around 150 sunny days a year like Minnesota). Wind looks to be good for helping with voltage regulation but like solar I bet that in areas like Minnesota it won&#x27;t work (Kansas? Sure, we get plenty of wind from the north or south depending on the season). And biofuels don&#x27;t look good to me since it becomes a choice between eating or powering your TV set (eating always wins).<p>So, nuclear will have to be the backbone of a new energy economy if we&#x27;re to advance the standard of living for developing nations and to maintain the standard of living for the developed nations as is.

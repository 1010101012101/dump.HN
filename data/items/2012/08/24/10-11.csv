It comes with a whole suite of symptoms and difficulties that are experienced directly by the patient, including depression, irritability, aphasias, and often physical limitations in advanced cases.<p>Long-term memory loss dominates public perception of the disease, but as anyone who works with dementia can tell you, most of the time it is as distressing for the patient as it is for the family.",1345805842

I am not sure if pubnub provides a way to trigger presence events. Pusher also provides these features afaik by using separate channels for e.g. presence events (not sure though). In Tambur you enable presence-events, direct- and authenticated messages on the same channel (we call them streams).

The complete para is :<p>""But though I was none the worse for having neglected exercise, I am still paying the penalty of another neglect. I do not know whence I got the notion that good handwriting was not a necessary part of education, but I retained it until I went to England. When later, especially in South Africa, I saw the beautiful handwriting of lawyers and young men born and educated in South Africa, I was ashamed of myself and repented of my neglect. I saw that bad handwriting should be regarded as a sign of an imperfect education. I tried later to improve mine, but it was too late. I could never repair the neglect of my youth. Let every young man and woman be warned by my example, and understand that good handwriting is a necessary part of education. I am now of opinion that children should first be taught the art of drawing before learning how to write. Let the child learn his letters by observation as he does different objects, such as flowers, birds, etc., and let him learn handwriting only after he has learnt to draw objects. He will then write a beautifully formed hand.""",1345805181

It sounds good- right, because they are spending money, that means it is creating demand and the goods and services they are buying increases economic activity.<p>The scientific reality is, this naive concept is ignoring the cost of that government spending.  All of the money government has comes from two sources- inflation and taxes.  Whichever way they raise the money, they do economic damage.<p>Thus government spending, like Obama's so-called ""stimulus"" plan, actually hurts the economy.<p>This is why, for instance, the unemployment rate ended up being higher than Obama claimed it would be if his plan wasn't passed.. even though his plan was passed.<p>But it is not very hard to find people who believe that some other thing caused unemployment to be higher.<p>In fact, both the Republican and Demcorat parties, and their partisan's ideologies, reject the science of economics and embrace pseudo-science.<p>In my lifetime, I've seen a great increase in embracing pseudo-scientific concepts or even anti-science positions, most recently and alarmingly, by people who insist that they are right because ""science"" agrees with them.<p>Another example:  Glaciers are getting smaller because of global warming.  This belief is completely unscientific-- there is no way to know how many glaciers there are on earth, let alone whether they are getting smaller, and nobody has even tried to guess whether more of them are shrinking than growing.<p>Another example:  The idea that the TSA protects us against airplane hijackings.  Or that somehow the government is protecting us against terrorism.  Or that mass shootings would be worse if guns were less regulated (the stats: 9.2 is the average number killed in areas where guns are banned, but only 2.2 people die in areas where the intended victims are allowed to be armed.)<p>Politics' natural enemy is science.",1345802629

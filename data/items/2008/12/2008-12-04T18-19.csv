If it's already apparent that this is a viable business, then there's probably already an entrenched player, and the network effect serves to keep you out.<p>2.) If it's not already apparent that this is a viable business, then prospective users are like ""Why should I bother?"" and you never get the initial critical mass.  After all, if the utility of the service grows with the square of the number of people, then the utility for the first person is zero and they have no reason to begin using the service.<p>It seems that most firms that overcame the initial network effect did so through a combination of blind luck or leveraging other assets.  For example, YouTube's traffic hovered around zero until they got SlashDotted.  EBay was blind luck - Pierre Omidyar figured he'd run an experiment on creating the perfect marketplace, and it turned out people sent him money.  Digg used Kevin Rose's TechTV audience to seed the initial site.  FictionAlley had the most popular HP fanfiction author as one of its founders, and she pulled her fanfiction off all other sites and hosted it exclusively on FictionAlley.

385907,story,,,5,4,meterplech,"Ask YC: Success innate or practice?",,"Malcolm Gladwell's (author or Blink and Tipping Point) has a new book, Outliers. He makes a variety of interesting and somewhat provocative claims about why successful people are successful. Perhaps the most provocative claim is that it requires 10,000 hours of practice to become and expert in anything. The implications of this include that Bill Gates and Bill Joy were so successful because of the opportunities they had to practice programming from Middle School (for Gates) and at UMich (for Joy). Do people buy this? How much of success is brilliance and how much is this amount of practice?",1228413989

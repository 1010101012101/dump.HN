1296030,comment,1295418,1295737,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Im going to kill my other posts because they were rushed and incoherent. But this is my more careful response.<p>Im disappointed the above thread has got so much support when it is fatally flawed.<p>The problem with extremism is that punishing the perpetrators is pretty irrelevant as a solution to the issue because, for the most part, they don't care (or to put it more bluntly: nothing you do can negate what God will provide them).<p>What we need is a solution to the problem of extremist groups.<p>The comparison to hostages is wrong; it is more like saying ""this is the decision between should I go to a hostage risk area or not?"".<p>It is a personal choice and I think what I am mostly saying is: we should individually consider whether our actions/comments are simply inciting the situation. If that is the case it may be reasonable simply not to say it (an example; if things are getting heated in a bar and you think the other guy is an airhead saying it to his face might not be the most sensible way to make your point).<p>Or more succinctly: why should we hand them ammunition if we don't have to? As you say; they will pick out all manner of grievances but that's not an argument for increasing their choice. Indeed in the case of parodies it is problematic; because it is legitimate to feel angered by them, and extremists can use that to say ""hey, so our violence is legitimate"".<p><i>A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.</i>",1272315599

But if popularity and IQ is statistically independent, only 1% will be among the top 10% in both.<p>So people that are both smart and popular can indeed be rare even when IQ and popularity are independent, we don't need more than a random distribution to explain that.<p>If we add the fact that people tend to focus on (and thereby improving) things they are good at and ignore (and thereby fall behind in) areas where they suck, it will only strengthen the trend.<p>I think nerds and jocks both follow the path of least resistance by putting most of their efforts into areas where they have a natural advantage.

That is, even if it is not a direct threat, but a veiled one, such as the one given by Revolution Muslim, the people that sent the threat should be quickly and forcefully prosecuted for committing a crime.<p>The moral dilemma is that this itself seems to limit free speech.  How can we allow the media to publish any parody or mock any religion, and at the same time keep extremists from making threats?

Your app doesn't appear to be social, so you don't need to create the illusion of popularity on-site, like reddit. Do you want evangelists, people going out and blogging about how great your app is?<p>I don't really know how to bring that about. Just make the best damn thing you can and then politely inform bloggers you read about it. If you look at the balsamiq (a mockup program) website there is a post on how the guy approached bloggers at the start.<p>I quite like the Steve Martin approach: ""be so good they can't ignore you"". Naively, I kind of think that if you make something great, that really solves a problem for people, they will want to share that with others.<p>So... I guess the answer is for you to very clearly define who you are helping, what problem you are helping them solve, and then approach them. By way of friendly criticism, your site could probably do with a better front page, in terms of a very quick explanation of what it is and why a reader might care.

If it is important then it needs to be said.<p>But if you say something for fun (which I think one should be allowed to do!) and because of it a bomb goes off elsewhere in the world - that is hard to justify.<p>> If we consistently replied with ""we don't listen to threats; if you follow up, you'll be punished,""<p>Yeh, the problem with applying this to extremism is that, for the most part, it doesn't work. On one hand it gives them ammunition to ""legitimise"" their actions and on the other punishment isn't necessarily a concern for some. They will kill anyway.",1272312373

Unless I missed a major news story about this, I don't think Twitter has yet violated anyone's trust there.<p>Facebook, on the other hand, by either incompetence or some skewed sense of openness, at some point has made a choice that it wants to put all your information out there while giving you the illusion that you have some control over it.<p>The point is that privacy isn't impossible. It's simple. You have an element in a database that is flagged as important to someone, so you make sure that before you ever pull that element out and put it on the web, the proper controls are in place. It is just a choice a company makes of how high of a priority to make something, and Facebook has demonstrated that privacy means more to them as a PR issue than a real concern about user data.",1272312296

However, i moved to a GNU/Linux distribution over 2 years ago and never looked back.<p>I have always said that the Microsoft environment is a hostile one for developers. And that is without saying anything about the quality of their platform.<p>There are still a lot of problems to be solved on the desktop side for which online equivalents probably won't work right now. Its just a matter of who steps up and solves them...<i></i>hint<i></i>",1216709921

253054,comment,252865,253008,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"I think that's fine, as long as it's not ""1 ports"".<p>The idea is that the patches randomize the source port, which the attacker won't know, so you'll ignore any responses that don't match. (it's still <i>possible</i> to guess the correct port number, but much much harder)<p>If you get ""1 ports"" for 26 queries then it's always using the same port (bad!), but if you get somewhere around 26 ports for 26 queries then it's using random ports (since it's random it won't always be 26 distinct ports, which is why it sometimes shows 24 or 25)<p>I'm no expert but this is what I understand of it. tptacek, feel free to explain it better (just kidding!)",1216707387

1327280,comment,1326944,1326944,0,0,AngryParsley,,,"Obesity is a complex problem and blah blah blah insert standard disclaimers here, but I think there are two things that, combined, contribute significantly to the problem:<p>1. Food is cheap<p>2. Most people enjoy eating food<p>Solutions include: Make food more expensive (tax it) or alter peoples' sense of hunger. The latter is actually not infeasible. There are drugs that decrease appetite.<p>Another idea takes some explaining: I think obesity has quite a bit in common with smoking. The biggest difference is that people need food to survive. Still, the solution to decreasing smoking could work on obesity. Smoking used to be quite popular, but today it isn't nearly as socially acceptable. In most places in the US, cigarrettes are taxed in both currency and social cost. Jokes at a smoker's expense are acceptable. It's not uncommon for friends or coworkers of smokers to suggest they quit.<p>The same is not true for obesity. Mocking fat people is considered rude. Suggesting they cut down on certain foods is also a delicate matter. An excuse for this taboo is that many fat people can't help it. They were born with genes that caused their metabolisms to run slower, or they feel hunger more strongly than average. But the same is true for many smokers. Their genes make them more susceptible to nicotine, or cause them to feel cravings more strongly than average. Yet we allow poking fun at smokers.<p>So while this suggestion won't be popular, I think it would be effective: Society needs to treat fatties more like smokers. If you see an overweight person doing something that will most likely increase their weight, picture them as they will be in 20 years: dying from diabetes and heart disease. Vision failing, fingers and toes pale from poor circulation. Possibly even missing a few digits. A premature death; an under-lived life, lacking many experiences healthy people take for granted. They never went rock climbing or surfing. Their extra weight causes them frequent back and joint pain. Think of all that suffering, and think of how you have an opportunity to prevent it. You probably won't be thanked for it, but you might very well save someone's life.<p>(I'm only half-joking in that last paragraph.)",1273233091

I hope he has better results with Raid5 then me tho. I have reverted back to a dual drive NAS for stability after having raid 5 servers for a long time.
Somehow IDE and SATA drives and raid cards don't cut it for me. I have lost my data so freaking often by corrupt arrays it's not fun anymore.<p>The first server I had used a Promise card (Supertrak SX6000) card (with 4 * 80 GB drives) that gave me nothing but problems (very poor performance and corrupt arays about once every 2 months). It was running on a standard non-server mobo with a decent but standard PSU, so one of the components might have caused problems tho.<p>The second was running on an Areca ARC-1210 card (with 8*320 Gb drives) on a tyan thunder dualxeon server mobo with an 850Watt Tagan server PSU and was put behind a 2200VA UPS. Even then the array seemed to dropout quite often and I have spend 100's of hours in total (updating drivers/firmware/OS'es, recovering lost data, replacing parts, cables, moving the server etc...) trying to get it to run decently.<p>Eventually I just sold the whole damn thing and bought me a simple COnceptronic CH3SNAS with 2 1,5TB drives for the cash I sold the old server for. I have ever never had a single problem in the whole year i've had it and am very happy with the purchase.
The performance is totally not comparable (600MB/Sec vs 20 MB/Sec), but even the slow NAS is sufficient enough for me (it streams HD movies just fine and my backups aren't TB's big anyways ;) ). Plus the power usage is literally  1/10th, it's very quiet and a lot easier to carry around and take with me if I need to.<p>Maybe I just fail at fileservers, maybe I just had bad luck with 2 bad cards, but I'm not convinced a simple affordable RAID-5 solution means your data is safe.<p>But I must admit I wouldn't mind having that self made NAS at my home tho, it looks cool :D
Maybe one day i'll try again.... ;)",1273232647

Total GDP went up significantly from 1996 to 2006, but the feeling is that it went mainly to the top 25%, with a good portion going to the top 10%. I believe (though I'd have to look it up) that real income of the bottom 50% was flat or declining over that period, which would mean that fully half the country doesn't perceive 1996-2006 as a positive economic period at all.<p>On the inflationary side, Zimbabwe is an obvious example (with Weimar Germany) of the levels you don't want to go to, but the 1970s Italian/Greek levels of circa 30% annual inflation (with a sort of punctuated equilibrium yearly distribution, i.e. 5-10% most years and 1000% once a decade) aren't quite the same as circa 30,000% annual inflation.

I decided not to have surgery right away, and got a brace.<p>A few years later, my preferred leisure activities changed, so I decided to have surgery done. It took 11 weeks to get an appointment (as it was elective surgery at that point). The surgery was done by an experienced surgeon (a few hundred ACLs under his belt), and he met with me 4 times himself during the following year to follow up on my recovery progress.<p>Total out of pocket cost was ~$300 for a couple optional recovery devices (icing machine, etc.).<p>Physiotherapy appointments were, however, covered by my employer's extended medical at the time. That was about $1-2k that I would have had to pay had I been completely uninsured. I probably would have elected for less and cheaper physio care in that case though.<p>Short version: after reading this article/thread, I'd honestly be scared to join YC in SV, especially now that I have a daughter.<p>(Side note, I tore my ACL in Ontario and had an initial appt there, but ended up getting treatment in BC.

2248487,comment,2246044,2247145,0,0,nl,,,"This is a <i>very</i> common meme, but there is some evidence to show that is isn't true.<p>Most fields (including software engineering) are pretty good at solving problems that have previously been solved. Generally speaking civil engineers are pretty good at building bridges that stay up for example (with occasional exceptions of course!). Similarly, software engineers are pretty decent at building accounting systems etc.<p>When any field attempts to do something new, software engineering is pretty much as good as any other field. Even fields as mature as mechanical engineering make mistakes.<p>For example, the space shuttle Challenger disaster was caused by defective O-ring seals, and delusional engineering management who systematically ignored warnings.<p>Richard Feynman (who knew something about building systems at the edge of what was possible) said the following, when comparing the software engineering process with other processes inside NASA:<p><i>The software is checked very carefully in a bottom-up fashion. First, each new line of code is checked, then sections of code or modules with special functions are verified. The scope is increased step by step until the new changes are incorporated into a complete system and checked. This complete output is considered the final product, newly released. But completely independently there is an independent verification group, that takes an adversary attitude to the software development group, and tests and verifies the software as if it were a customer of the delivered product. There is additional verification in using the new programs in simulators, etc. A discovery of an error during verification testing is considered very serious, and its origin studied very carefully to avoid such mistakes in the future. Such unexpected errors have been found only about six times in all the programming and program changing (for new or altered payloads) that has been done. The principle that is followed is that all the verification is not an aspect of program safety, it is merely a test of that safety, in a non-catastrophic verification. Flight safety is to be judged solely on how well the programs do in the verification tests. A failure here generates considerable concern.</i><p><i>To summarize then, the computer software checking system and attitude is of the highest quality. There appears to be no process of gradually fooling oneself while degrading standards so characteristic of the Solid Rocket Booster or Space Shuttle Main Engine safety systems. To be sure, there have been recent suggestions by management to curtail such elaborate and expensive tests as being unnecessary at this late date in Shuttle history. This must be resisted for it does not appreciate the mutual subtle influences, and sources of error generated by even small changes of one part of a program on another. There are perpetual requests for changes as new payloads and new demands and modifications are suggested by the users. Changes are expensive because they require extensive testing. The proper way to save money is to curtail the number of requested changes, not the quality of testing for each.</i><p><a href=""http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v2appf.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v2appf.htm</a><p>Edit, TL;DR: <i>To summarize then, the computer software checking system and attitude is of the highest quality.

There was a definite brain drain of doctors (especially specialists) who choose to go to affluent suburbs and urban areas simply because they get more (and better quality, AKA rich) patients. You think if we _further_ privatized the market, those in rural areas would be _better_ served? Isn't that the opposite of what the free market would actually do? In fact, take a look at this study[1] about physicians in rural America. It's eye opening how they advocate federal and state intervention (read Medicaid and Medicare) as one of the solutions (along with opening training up to more potential candidates, which even I as a liberal elitist supports).<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1071163/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1071163/</a>",1298343390

2248475,comment,2245786,2246707,0,0,PakG1,,,"Some of the police brutality comes down to poor decision-making due to poor training and little experience.  I never saw it that way until I read Malcolm Gladwell's Blink.  There's a chapter where he discusses an incident in New York where cops shot up an innocent guy.  The analysis was that in high-pressure situations, the mind ceases to function and focuses purely on survival and sustaining one's self.  One becomes essentially autistic in being unable to recognize social signs such as facial expressions, body movements, etc, and the outcomes when weapons are in play are often gruesome.<p>It was quite an enlightening read, and I think I take it seriously because my own experience in high pressure situations.  First was a time when I was taking a walk with my dad and some kids surrounded us.  One tried to spray pepper spray in my face from behind, but my dad saw he was doing something so yelled at him, and my dad got sprayed instead.  Then they all ran.  I was stunned and couldn't process what was going on; really, I was just so focused on the guy in front of me, my decision-making process was paralyzed.<p>My second was when I was the venue technology manager for Cypress Mountain at the Vancouver Winter Olympics (freestyle skiing and snowboarding).  In terms of operational pressure, that was the most difficult thing I ever experienced, and even more so because Cypress was literally the most difficult and complicated venue of the Olympics.  There were situations where my brain literally just shut down and I was going 100 miles an hour trying to fix whatever went wrong; there's a word for that, it's called panic.  If it weren't for the training I had and some of my more experienced colleagues, I imagine it would have been an utter disaster.<p>I can only imagine that if I have some guns, batons, or any other type of weapon, and am meant to quell a situation, it could get ugly easily.<p>edit:  One more anecdote, my friend is an immigration officer.  He had an incident once where he and another officer were interrogating a guy because some papers or something needed clarification.  The guy suddenly made a move, they misinterpreted, and it became an all-out brawl.  My friend distinctly remembers yelling at his colleague and his colleague yelling back at him, but they could not hear each other.  Their minds were in a zone where they could no longer communicate, they were just subconsciously focused on survival.  Later, it all turned out to be a mistake, but in the heat of the moment, it was hard to discern that.",1298343192
2248474,comment,2247560,2247619,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"""instead of doing anything serious about it, we've done almost the worst possible option: require every one of us to be a customer of these monstrous companies, with little regulation on cost or other government oversight""<p>This is a common misunderstanding of the economics of this situation. The principle involved here is ""Adverse Selection"".<p>To illustrate, let's look at automobile liability insurance. The reason this insurance is so affordable for most americans is that 1) everyone with a car must pay it and 2) there is price competition among insurers.<p>Imagine for a moment that automobile liability insurance was optional. Who would benefit the most from having this insurance? Accident-prone drivers or non-accident-prone drivers?<p>That's right - the accident-prone drivers.<p>And since accident-prone drivers have the most incentive to have liability insurance, you would see the customer pool of the insurance start skewing heavily towards these high-risk drivers.<p>Then, since it's mostly the high-risk drivers in the customer pool, the number of claim payouts would go dramatically up along with the average payout per claim.<p>In order for the insurance company to remain in business they would be forced to raise their rates OR to be super strict about not insuring customers that seem risky.<p>Naturally, the insurance business only works if you have more money coming in than going out. And in order for the insurance to be ""affordable"" to most people, then the risk needs to be spread amongst most people (not just the more risky ones).<p>So, while I understand and share your frustration at the current state of health care in the U.S. - it's important to point out ""why"" everyone needs to be insured in order for the rates to be ""affordable"".<p>Of course there are other important variables affecting health insurance premium rates (rising health care costs is a major one), but the ""Adverse Selection"" issue is probably the most important.<p>-----<p>Another point to consider is that the current big health insurance companies have focused their skill on just a couple things:<p>1. Avoiding risky customers (by denying them or offering only super-high premiums)<p>2. Paying out as little as possible (by reducing health care costs and denying claims)<p>The dynamics of the health insurance market are about to be dramatically changed. #1 will no longer be nearly as important and there will be a huge jump in the size of the market. This will be a huge opportunity for disruption in the industry.<p>The old health care companies are extremely slow, bloated, and resistant to change. It's easy to see that new entrants will be able to grab significant market share from them and initiate some real price competition.<p>It's frustrating to have to wait the few years until this happens, but I'm very optimistic about the future (assuming the recent health care reforms won't be diluted before they can be enacted).",1298343187

My business partner and I have been working on an interesting mobile app and website that we launched this past weekend with one customer.

Therefore, now we're trying to deal with next steps and react as quickly as possible.<p>We've already been approached by an industry insider who says we shouldn't worry about selling to customers, but should be more focused on selling what we've built to a large entity that would like to own our product.  He's certain that he can help us make that happen quicker than I would've ever imagined.  It seems like a stretch, but I actually think he's right because of the response we've had.  I need to come to some sort of financial agreement with this industry insider on what share he would receive if he helps us sell the company/product to one of these big players.  I've never done this before and was thinking something along the lines of 10-15%.  It's our idea and we've done all the work.

Walk the streets of Beijing or Shanghai (the 2 cities where this is most likely to matter in China) and you'll see that most shops are convenience stores and dingy eateries trying to eke out a living selling 2RMB ice cream pops and water, NOT ""skydiving lessons! pottery classes! cosmetic dental procedures! maybe if i can drive some loss leader business in and call it an advertising cost, it'll be a good long run investment!""<p>Beijing and China are big cities, but most of the citizenry inhabit a tiny subset of the city.  People go YEARS without venturing beyond a 1 mile radius of where they live.  They rarely travel to other parts of the city to ""try a new restaurant"" or ""hey, let's do pilates"".  For most people in China, everything they need is already there, so a groupon for something across town isn't appealing (most stuff on groupon isn't in close proximity to my house).<p>That said, even though <i>most</i> people are like this, even if some small %age of the population cares, (small %age) * (shit ton of people) == possibly profitable for Groupon.<p>China does have a lot of money and growing consumerism, but the gini coefficient is absurd.  The median monthly income in Beijing is < 600 RMB (<USD$1000).   People who have money can buy whatever they want and are relatively price insensitive.<p>Gift certificate and coupons aren't widely used in China.  They exist, but they haven't been a fixture in the consumer landscape the way they have been in the US.  Prices in China are a suggestion, and aren't even always written.  The price for a widget is a function of how much the vendor likes you, the time of day, if the shop has to pay rent soon, and only sometimes, the actual cost to produce it.<p>I'm not going to speculate on counterfeit coupons as a problem, but I can't imagine that will help the cause.<p>This will fail because the intersection of businesses who want to use groupon + consumers who care about groupon is smaller than you'd guess for a huge population, buying and travel habits aren't conducive to the groupon model, there will be distrust of the brand and discount mechanism.",1298341443

I think that you're mis-directing anger here. 'Hacking' in some cases (in the US at least) carries harsher penalties than other more heinous crimes (regardless of the amount of damage done). Hackers usually face stiff minimum penalties (in the US). Had he been tried in the US he probably would have spend a decade or more in federal prison, and been destitute and/or a 'product of the system' by the time that he got out. This would have increased the chance that he would re-offend (and just not be stupid enough to get caught this time).<p><pre><code>  > * Hacking Valve. Damage: $250,000,000. Punishment: 2 years probation.
</code></pre>
Do you <i>really</i> believe that Valve lost $250M? That number is probably equivalent to the amount of money that Valve had invested into the Half-Life 2 source code at that point in time or the amount of money that they expected to earn through that source code. In hind-sight, Valve didn't lose much. They were still able to monetize their source code, and were very successful at it. Do you really think that there are people out there that did not buy Half-Life 2 because they downloaded the source code to a broken pre-release version of it? Do you really think that there are any serious commercial game companies out there that are using the leaked source code in their code base rather than licensing the engine from Valve?<p>The amount of 'damages' that Valve incurred due to this is/was speculative. Of course, once the initial estimate comes out, Valve isn't going to go back and state what the actual damages were, because then people would question why the initial estimate was so high.  There are also perverse incentives to inflate those numbers:<p>- Larger damages get more attention from the FBI.<p>- Larger damages are more likely to see harsher action by the justice system (aka courts).<p>- Larger damages garner more sympathy from the public.<p>- Larger damages can make you look like a hero to investors when the reality turns out to not be so bleak. You can always spin yourself as the hero that saved the company from financial ruin.<p>- Larger damages make the incident a likely scapegoat should the financial quarter be tough on the company (much like piracy is the scapegoat for the MPAA). E.g. ""Yea we did poorly, but it wasn't our fault! It was all that darn hacker!"" When in reality the leak had nothing to do with the losses.<p><pre><code>  > Yeah, it worked out with Bernie Madoff, actually. Still it

We're a family of four, and <i>we</i> don't spend $1200/year on health care, let alone $4800/year or (gak) the significantly greater amount we <i>really</i> spend on the low-deductable group coverage we set up for Matasano.<p>A $5k deductable would suit us just fine; we'd save, significantly, simply by plowing the money we would have spent on crazy bullshit low-deductable insurance into an interest-bearing vehicle and shelling out from it when we actually needed care, all the while secure in the knowledge that when someone ends up in the ICU, our liability is capped. Not for nothing, but this is a scheme that both Dems and Republicans buy into.<p>Health care in America is broken. But it's not ""utterly, utterly"" broken. Whatever the number of random medical bk's we have in the US, it's too high. But we don't need to transform our health insurance system into the National Health or the French system. We are epsilon away from a Swiss-style system of mandatory and guaranteed-issue private insurance.<p>† <i><a href=""http://www.thecasongroup.com/forms/enrollment/Humana/H1%20Underwriting%20Guide%2010_2009.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thecasongroup.com/forms/enrollment/Humana/H1%20Un...</a> .</i><p>†† <i>Many tens of thousands of dollars.

That is worse than every other profession the Times looked at. Yes, even lawyers.</i><p>I don't think wage gap is what's pushing people away...the worst case difference in tech is around 10%, which is not particularly bad compared to most fields, and for recent grads the gap is much smaller, around 4%.<p>I'd probably look to absolute value of wages instead for an explanation, though that wouldn't explain a difference between men and women's preferences.<p><i>If you want to bring women into the industry, you need to make the industry appealing to women. With current discriminatory practices that is just not the case, and until that changes, there won't even be an opportunity to recruit women, because those with anything less than a burning passion for the career are going to look elsewhere.</i><p>While I don't really think that discriminatory practices in tech are any worse than the general average across fields (I at least think that's an accusation that requires substantial proof), you bring up an interesting point. Most tech people that I've worked with <i>do</i> have a burning passion for it, and to be good in this field, it's pretty much a prerequisite.<p>I wonder what is blocking more women from feeling as passionate about tech as men do, especially since such passion usually emerges <i>very</i> early, well before one has opportunity to interact with anyone in the field (this is why I'm always skeptical of claims that teachers, professors, bosses, etc. have anything to do with this, I was programming on my own almost a decade before I ever interacted meaningfully with other programmers).

I wonder if perhaps the difference could have to do with time spent playing video games, at least for the current generation...",1324130073

3364224,comment,3362740,3362740,6,0,Silhouette,,,"Sorry, I don't really buy this one.<p>For projects that depend on solving simple problems, that is, those which any competent developer could solve well, then sometimes communication and teamwork are probably the limiting factor. Of course, even then, it is possible that a ""10x developer"" (a crude simplification, but it will do) could do the work of 10 1x developers and without the overhead: one such person will be 100x more efficient at internal communications and 10x more efficient at external communications <i>by default</i>, so your ""10x team"" members will each need to be 10x more efficient based on their better communication skills <i>just to break even</i>. Unless your 10x developer is particularly bad at communicating -- and in my experience, the opposite is frequently true, because that is a big part of how someone <i>becomes</i> the mythical 10x developer -- I'm not sure you'll ever hit that.<p>Then you have to look at projects that depend on solving hard problems, those where developers below a certain level of skill and/or insight will not be able to find an acceptable solution. Here your overall performance is at least partly determined by how many developers you have above that threshold and how well <i>they</i> communicate. This is why having a crude 1x vs. 10x approximation isn't very helpful in my view: it's always a sliding scale, and maybe a couple of 3x developers in the mix is all you need for the team as a whole to get over a tricky hurdle.<p>In the limit, for projects that depend on solving a really hard problem, your bound may simply be the maximum skill/insight level of any individual on your team. If you don't have anyone good enough, you can't solve the problem at all.<p>On top of that, in the real world, few products and services depend on solving a single problem with a single monolithic team. You are going to have multiple problems to solve, possibly by different groups of people, which then need to be co-ordinated in some way. In other words, your overall team is going to have cliques, possibly on several levels of nesting, and you need to worry about the performance of each clique, which in turn depends on the talents and the team-working within that clique as set out above. And on top of all of that, you have to worry about communication between cliques, integrating their work to produce the overall product or service. And then you have the fact that membership of cliques is not constant: staff will come and go, sometimes people will change role to make better use of their skills and experience or simply to keep their interest level up in a long-running project, etc. This is why <i>good</i> managers, co-ordinators like software architects, and technical leaders are so valuable.<p>In short: I think the whole premise of this article is a gross over-simplification based on some dubious basic assumptions, starting with the fact that those people who lift the team in various ways aren't actually the very 10x developers you're talking about. If all you do is develop software that solves simple problems with small teams then maybe the premise is true to a point, because you don't take much advantage of the stronger developers. Plenty of real world projects are like this, of course. However, I expect few people reading HN want to work on them, and plenty more real world projects need more. No amount of hiring chummy people with mediocre skills is going to make those projects succeed.",1324129881

But drawing people from the exact same pool of talent is not necessarily a good thing to do at all -- in fact, it can be down right detrimental to the team. But to be clear, I am not saying that diversity is a cure either -- having too many opinions on how something should be done is also problematic.<p>I agree with the main premise of the article that you need a team of complimentary individuals. I think this touches on something that is similar to the notion of 'how to hire someone who is smarter than you are.' So hiring people that are like you, or the rest of the team, could be a mistake. Hiring people that compliment the current team is, IMHO, the right way to build a team.<p>I have experienced both sides of this coin: one team that on paper was probably not all that impressive, but came together and made a brilliant team. And the opposite, where the team was a collection of brilliant individuals from the same school who were unable to function effectively as a team because there was no leader and everyone thought their approach to a given problem was best.<p>So while communication is hugely important, I think that it is also essential to avoid hiring people who are like you or who you feel comfortable around simply because of a shared background.",1324129575

Quite true, I definitely agree to it.</i><p>I don't know that I'm so sure. Most other professional industries were, at one point, just as lopsidedly male as tech is these days. But as society lifted the more explicit barriers and it became common for women to pursue professional careers, they naturally flowed into all sorts of different roles (the ""Jackie Robinson effect"", so to speak).<p>That they haven't showed up in tech (and math and science, though there are slightly more there) means there's something else going on, and I just can't buy the theory that women have stayed away because there are few women, since that has proved to be a relatively small deterrent in so many other cases.<p>I'm similarly skeptical that sexism in the industry is responsible for this, because it's just as rampant, if not moreso, in most industries (I could tell you some really unbelievable stories about the finance industry, yeegads...). That's not to say that because ""everybody else does it"" it's right or okay in tech; rather, it's to say that unless there's some clear reason why sexism in tech should push women away more forcefully than it does in other fields (or a shred of non-anecdotal evidence that sexism is more prevalent in tech, which I have never seen, and which I'm skeptical about because if it was true it seems fair to assume that we'd see a greater pay gap than in most other fields, which is not the case), it's hard for me to accept it as the main reason women aren't showing up to the party. And if it's not the <i>real</i> reason that women aren't getting into the field, then we might be missing the actual cause, which perhaps we could do something about.<p>Or maybe we can't.

If you can't figure out a solution to that problem one way or another, who is going to believe that you have the tenacity and smarts to figure out out other problems (such as programming problems).  Figure out something: take out loans in your own name, work during the day and get a degree at night, go for continuing education courses.  If you want it enough you will be able to find a way.  And having the degree will help to solve the problem of people not wanting to hire you for lack of a degree, which is going to be with you for your entire career if you don't get one.",1216421807

Joe just doesn't flat out know how to communicate with people. He's brusque and most of the time, just downright rude. He's condescending and often wrong. He is nosy too. Always giving advice and telling people whats what with their problems. The worst part is that everybody just tolerates his crap when they need to. Otherwise, they just avoid him and try to work with him as little as possible.<p>And just like this article points out, the people in my department blame the leadership because they don't do anything about. We complain when he gets out of hand and he has been talked to about his attitude, but the cycle simply repeats itself.<p>I don't know why we keep him around. We can do A LOT better.",1216421558

I haven't read it myself, but the first chapter is online for free in a PDF and it is pretty good. I can't really justify paying to buy it out of print, but you should since it's your area of business (assuming you find the first chapter useful).<p>The obvious thing to do is to have some sort of tool that matches the problem people are trying to solve to the best problem solving model for that type of problem, and then to force them to decide within the constraints of that model. If you can do that then you may have a pretty lucrative business on your hands.",1216421179

250296,comment,250232,250254,0,0,ardit33,,,"I have to say there is always two sides of the story.<p>Sometimes these ""bad apples"" are actually decent or good employees, but the disfunctional dynamics, or even maybe bad managers can turn a potentially good employee into a bad one.<p>When managers are incompetent technically, some tend to rely on few employees they trust on decission.  The problem is that these trusted employees become trusted not necessary of their technical skills, but their affinity, (or ass kissing abilities) to their manager.<p>A good manager, will be able to take advice from all his employees, and even his most technical ones.  A bad manager will rely a lot more on his chronies,  which, there is a great chance, they are going to be technicallly incompetent.<p>So, if you are actually good, but forced to implement things you think are stupid, just because your manager happens to trust other people's opinion's more, then it it is going to be frustrating.
Some people suck it up,  some leave, some just moan and complain, and of course are labeled bad apples.<p>And this happens way to often,  especially in larger companies.  Small companies, will go with the technical competence, otherwise die.  
Technical incompetence and chronyism  thrives is large coorporations, with lots of managerial layers.<p>Sometimes, there are truly people that are bad apples, and shouldn't be there,  but often there are people that are great, but slowly become a bad apple b/c of the above circumstances.",1216420826

250293,comment,249967,250230,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Agreed. I guess I should have added, ""without making things unnecessarily complicated."".<p>I think that monads, too, are generally presented in a way that makes them more complicated than they really are. (Hence, I suppose, SPJ's comment about how they should have been called ""warm fuzzy things"".) Part of my trouble understanding them confronting the basics of Haskell at the same time, and I (along with much of what I read) focused on the IO monad. That's probably one of the most complicated ones. The ideas started to click when I switched to the Maybe monad -- not only is that one considerably more straightforward, but I (and probably many others) had already written essentially the same construct elsewhere, albeit without the formal notation.",1216420462

The problem is that our application server needs to know that the requests we are getting from our flex application are not spoofed.<p>Right now we essentially have a secret key that is hashed with request data to authenticate the flex app.<p>Problem is, how do we keep the secret key in the flex app code without someone able to snag it by decompiling? I can think of a million ways to obscure the key into the code, but that only will delay a break in, not stop it.<p>It seems impossible for there to be any secure cryptographic system if an intruder can see the source.<p>Is there any good way to actually secure flex from getting decompiled?

Favorites are more for letting your friends know great individual photos you've discovered as you wander flickr.<p>More apropos to what you're doing is ourdoings.com's option (on by default) to let anybody move a photo between the ""featured"" and ""more photos"" sections for a given entry.  Make an unlisted site just for your friends, tell them to click on the ""Edit"" tab and volunteer.  Once you approve them, everybody can upload, etc., so it's a nice group site.<p>It's integrated with Clickpass (a YC startup), so registration is trivial.  You can edit photos after uploading thanks to integration with Snipshot (another YC startup).  If $25 is a lot of money, maybe you should make your site public rather than unlisted.  That way you could collect tips with tipjoy (another YC startup).  Public sites are also the only ones that can use Disqus integration, until such time as Disqus supports private comments.  OurDoings is the only photo-sharing site with Disqus comments.",1216419626

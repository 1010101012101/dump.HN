123582,comment,123354,123474,0,0,dreish,,,"altavista.digital.com was a reflexive habit two years before Google was.  Now, there are kids who have never heard of it.<p>There's no doubt in my mind that if Google had failed to keep up with SEO spammers, someone else would have replaced them just like they replaced AltaVista.  The value proposition would be simple: No more poring over search results to find the one non-spam page you were actually looking for buried on the fourth page.",1203994622

123580,comment,123495,123495,0,0,ca,,,"While I'm not an American, it will be very interesting to watch how Mr. Lessig is able to raise awareness of government corruption and to see how successful his efforts are. Here in Canada, the government seems to be looking into updating copyright legislation in some, shall we say, suspiciously biased ways. If his methods are successful, I hope we can adapt them to the Canadian system.<p>The Canadian who seems to fill a similar spokesperson / visionary niche as Mr. Lessig is Michael Geist (<a href=""http://www.michaelgeist.ca/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.michaelgeist.ca/</a>). He was the figurehead in the fight against the recent proposed copyright reforms here and had a great grasp of the situation and how to organize a grass-roots opposition to it.<p>As an aside, I find Mr. Lessig's presentation style quite interesting. For online presentations, where one can't use the flesh and blood presence of the presenter, the frequent updates are a huge attention magnet. It would be a pretty big departure from the 10-20-30 rule, but I wonder how well a business pitch made in this style would work. Another example of a presentation of Mr. Lessig's that exemplifies the style (and is beautifully and passionately presented) is available at <a href=""http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/187"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/187</a> .

The method used is a fairly standard genetic algorithm. The fascinating part is that the evolved circuit is unlike anything designed by humans. For example: <i>""A further five cells appeared to serve no logical purpose at all — there was no route of connections by which they could influence the output. And yet if he disconnected them, the circuit stopped working.""</i>",1203994488

123573,comment,123265,123459,0,0,dusklight,,,"Well okay let me elaborate on my question.<p>pg has stated that code brevity is one of the main design goals of arc. But what is pretty obvious is that code brevity is not the only consideration. It is desirable to be able to write very short code, but it should be readable as well. If you write very short code that is difficult for other people to read, that is bad enough. If you write very short code that ends up being difficult even for yourself to read -- then we have a problem.<p>The above ruby code snippet is a great example of code where reducing the length not only did not reduce readability, but actually increased it. I know some people have complained about it being obfuscated on this board. But to me, and I am sure to a number of other people on this board, it was easy to understand, intuitive even.<p>so .. in arc, what would be a similar way to create a list of numbers from 1 to 100, and to evaluate the sum of that list?",1203994087

123562,comment,123542,123545,0,0,TheTarquin,,,"I completely agree.  The common wisdom is that modern passenger rail would fail in America.  Really, I think that it can be a huge success, but only in local links.<p>Recent discussion in my area (Eastern Washington state) has broached the idea of a fast light rail service among the Spokane/Coeur D'alene area (tech center of E. Wa.) down to the Tri-Cities (which have a DoE National Lab and the Hanford Nuclear site) and the Moscow/Pullman access which has two big state universities (WSU and UI).  Those kinds of local links can work and be a great thing for economic and intellectual interchange, I think.  Trans-continental railways probably aren't the best solution for cross-country travel anymore, but locally I think they're the way to go.<p>Just look at the UK: light rail is a huge boon for commuters going to and from the London orbital.<p>Then again, IANARE (I Am Not A Railroad Engineer).",1203993194

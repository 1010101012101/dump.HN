Slightly higher in Australia, lower in the USA.  So if 55 is still middle aged, then 60 or so will probably be the boundary into old age.<p>Dividing things up equally, we get that old age is 60 to 80, and middle age is 40 to 60, and the age where you don't think about it and don't name it is 20 to 40.<p>That fits.<p>So what about pre 20?  I've always held that children are aliens that mutate into humans.  I think we pretty much would all agree that teenagers are not properly human, and so that ties in.  Up to age 13 we are aliens, then 13 through to about 20 we mutate into humans.  20 to 40 we're simply ""people"", 40 to 60 middle-aged, 60 onwards old-aged.<p>I'm not sure I find that comforting ...",1251672853

795071,comment,794245,794397,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> So while you're claiming that the author can't use America as a free-market example to bash on, that's not the real point.<p>I'm claiming there's problems with the American system that everyone, regardless of party or political affiliation, can agree with. I'm further claiming that they have fairly simple fixes that would reduce cost and increase quality. That means healthier people with more options. Here's one such way:<p>Tax-advantaged health insurance is one reason the system is so expensive - frequently, <i>all</i> health care purchases are routed through insurance if a person can afford health insurance. That means there's these huge administrative costs and conflicts over treatments.<p>There'd be lots of ways of addressing it: You could gradually remove the tax break on it, you could give everyone the option to receive any of their benefits in cash tax-free instead of the tax-free benefit, you could allow people to deduct all health and medical spending regardless of insurance. I don't know where those three ways of changing things would fall in the political continuum, but one increases taxes, one lowers taxes, and one keeps the tax yields about the same while reducing the reliance on the inefficient insurance system with its associated bureaucracy.<p>> The general debate out there is that a lot of people are saying ""we don't want socialism"" and ""the free-market is more effective"" while refering to the American system.<p>Yes, I'm intentionally sidestepping that debate, pointing out three issues that are not backed by either party, that everyone can agree on. We can fix those and be more prosperous, and then continue to the general debate in which people have been having a very hard time of agreeing.<p>The American system is more expensive than it should be for the quality. There's a few elegant, low cost, simple improvements that can be made. I think we ought to make them.",1251671222

""You know"", I said, ""I remember knowing how better sorts worked, once. But I'm blanking on it now, so let me just write the stupidest thing that could possibly work, and then after that I'll see if I've had time to remember anything.""<p>It didn't seem to be a big deal. Nor should it be -- the goal of your interviewer is to watch you do things like: test your code, remember to check the edge cases, manipulate pointers correctly, be able to figure out how your brain-dead bubblesort algorithm is likely to scale as N grows larger, knowing what exceptions are and understanding their proper role...<p>It's possible that the interview is <i>better</i> if you're missing your higher brain functions while you're writing the demo code.

795063,comment,795007,795007,0,0,sharpn,,,"User support differs from many other roles in that a standard interview actually can be a very good way to evaluate a candidate: it gives you a chance to demonstrate clarity and succinct answers to questions you initially have no control over. Remember that your interviewer (should) be looking for someone who can quickly & clearly answer a question - so always be brief rather than expansive [which is not always good advice for other roles].\n  I recommend mentioning the importance of gently (but firmly) controlling the direction of a support conversation to identify the core issue & efficiently identifying the best response - resolve/escalate/apologise/whatever. Then <i>if possible</i> demonstrate that skill within the interview - so if subsequently asked a vague 'open' question, politely ask 'closed' questions to narrow down the real substance behind that question, and then answer <i>that</i> decisively.\n  Good luck!",1251670833

795061,comment,794285,794962,0,0,rg3,,,"Every time Slackware is metioned in a news site, fans of it will always write comments saying how they love it, and many other users like to point out how Slackware's package management is ""nonexistant"" or outdated, in the sense that it doesn't resolve dependencies automatically and we're in 2009. There are even some Slackware fans who counter-attack saying that manually resolving dependencies is better and that you should not trust a program to do the job.<p>Now, as a long time Slackware user, I'm going to give you my opinion: it's all a matter of taste. Different people like different types of systems, and Slackware is a perfectly valid distribution for many people.<p>The reason it doesn't resolve dependencies automatically has to do with its ""KISS"" principle. Normally, to resolve dependencies effectively you need to add more stuff to the package management tools. For example, it makes much more sense to automatically resolve dependencies when the package management tools know the concept of remote repository, know the list of available packages, and what each package provides, and they can talk to the servers over the network to download packages automatically. Like apt-get does.<p>In Slackware, the package management tools you get are really really simple internally, and are in fact shell scripts (installpkg, removepkg, upgradepkg, etc). All they understand is package files, which are tarballs, and they don't really perform complex tasks. The package management tools in Slackware follow the KISS principle, and the line was drawn at that point. If you want to resolve dependencies automatically, then you probably need remote repositories, talking over the network, keeping a package database, etc. Slackware drew the line before all of that to keep the system simple. As easy as that.<p>As a Slackware user, I will never say that having to resolve dependencies by hand is a good thing. However, it's a very minor flaw that needs to be present if you want the package management to be simple, like the rest of the system. Slackware, internally, is very simple and stable. It's one of the few distributions you can very easily learn almost by heart. There are so few pieces and they fit together so easily...<p>For people like me, Slackware is the best choice because we want that type of system and we enjoy being working at the computer and knowing perfectly the system you're working on. Solving dependencies automatically is not a priority for me and having to do it manually is a non-issue. I don't install new software everyday. I just keep my system with the applications I need and use it. Contrary to one of the comments above, I don't use Slackware to hack and learn. I use it to get the job done. That's what computers are for, and Slackware is still a very valid system for that.<p>How do I track dependencies? If a program doesn't run because it lacks a library, running it from the command line will tell you which library is lacking. The ldd command can tell you that too. From that point, it's very easy to know what you are missing that the program needs. Library names usually match the package name. For other cases you can use the package browser and ask for the library (packages.slackware.it), you can ask in the IRC channel at freenode for a quick answer, you can ask at LinuxQuestions and you can also manually look in the MANIFEST.bz2 file present in every mirror, as it mentions the files each package provides.<p>If the problem lies in a piece of software you are trying to compile, usually the program documentation contains the appropriate information including a list of requirements. Some of those requirements may have an official package and some others may have to be installed by hand too.<p>But, really, it's not that hard and for most people this problem doesn't turn up all the time, at all. If you like the system, you won't find offensive to lose a bit of time tracking a few dependencies in a software package you're installing. Specially if you're going to use the software for months. That initial effort is not that important, at least in my humble opinion. Like I said at the beginning, it's a matter of taste and what fits you better.",1251670443

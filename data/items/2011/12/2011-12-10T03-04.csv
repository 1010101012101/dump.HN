3336863,comment,3335603,3336693,1,0,marcamillion,,,"I agree with most everything...Solyndra...definitely..that was gov't interferring with the markets at its worse. GM, I definitely agree...much better to go through a 'controlled bankruptcy' and have new mgmt negotiate with the UAW on more amenable pension & health arrangements. They are already making good progress there.<p>As for even AIG getting a 'bailout', I don't quite agree with that. Yes, they did get a ton of money, on seemingly 'cheap terms', but the logic is the same. If the insurer of all these financial instruments can't honor it's contracts...imagine the implications for the economy as a whole. Not only would they be reneging on contracts, enshrined in law, but many firms that purchased all sorts of insurance (not just on CDOs) - GE, Walmart, etc - on various assets/products would instantly be SOL.<p>So even if you take just the financial firms and their tanglings there out of the picture, in terms of getting back 100 cents on the dollar on their CDS Swaps, if AIG can't honor ANY of their contracts at a time when companies (all throughout the country in hundreds of industries) are experiencing softer aggregate demand and falling revenue, just that alone would be catastrophic beyond anything we have ever seen.<p>So I don't see it as an 'AIG bailout', but rather saving the US economy. Besides, they will be able to recoup their investment once they finish selling the useful assets and repairing the balance sheet over the long term.<p>Also, it's not just Fannie and Freddie that are to blame - as Bernanke said the exhorbitant global imbalances with countries running massive current account surpluses that creates an incentive for investors to put money to work. China doesn't want it's $3T sitting in cash, even just $100B sitting in cash could cost China about $2B - $10B/year depending on where it is sitting (just in inflation alone). So the pressure to at least do something to protect it against inflation is immense and that's just China.<p>Suffice it to say, there are many factors (from the mortgage tax credit to Fannie & Freddie to global imbalances to misaligned incentives on Wall St.) that are to blame. The damn media likes to play on the most populist and it's annoying.<p>One of the things I can say, is that I am impressed that people like Bernanke and Paulson can hold their nose and go against EVERYTHING they believe in (i.e. non-intervention in markets) and everything they have been taught and learned over their entire professional careers and completely violate these beliefs in a matter of days/weeks. It's easy to sit on the sidelines and vilify these people for their actions, when you don't quite understand the implications of non-action and even how tough it was for them to make those decisions. The fact is, these people ignored their beliefs and acted in the country's interest.<p>I am not even American and I can admire their actions.<p>Edit 1: To put their actions into perspective, it's the equivalent of being a 'pro-lifer' your entire life and in order to save the entire country you have to personally sanction wide-scale abortions. How many people would be able to do that? Might be a little dramatic, but I believe the parallels are similar.",1323489243

I like NaCl.<p>Sorry if I wasn't clear before, when I said ""no one but Google thinks NaCl is good for the web"", I was talking in the context of browser makers. I meant the fact that Google is the only browser maker that thinks NaCl is good for the web.<p>> Web apps and games are not going away, and I think it's clear that we need something easier to statically optimize than JavaScript as the runtime system for the web.<p>We can do that in a portable, standards-based way without a complete break like NaCl with its downsides.<p>Consider what the PyPy compiler does to RPython: It compiles RPython, a subset of Python, down to C, by statically discovering all the types and so forth. The same can be done for JavaScript, since the performance-sensitive code people are writing is almost always statically-typed (but implicitly, without writing types) anyhow, just like RPython.<p>In fact we are already moving towards that now, with technologies like the global type analysis in SpiderMonkey TI. With a few more years of work, that approach should make performance-sensitive JavaScript as fast as we need it to be. There is no technical impossibility here, it just takes time - we are half-way there, with things like RPython showing this is definitely feasible.",1323489012

Besides the usual patent troll options of:<p>- (costly) settle<p>- (costly) fight<p>There is now a third option of:<p>- (profitable!) join the bandwagon, not get sued (by this particular company), strengthen your own IP defence position by gaining licenses to the entire portfolio that was threatening you in the first place. There's even profit-share for settlement revenue!(Edit: profit-share might be for ""board"" seats only, but it sounds like it costs IP contributions to get in anyway.) All for a low low cost of transferring over some patents (that are just licensed right back to you).

3336810,comment,3335603,3336586,10,0,_delirium,,,"More or less because reasonably-priced health insurance requires a risk pool in which membership isn't voluntary, and large companies provide such a pool by requiring that all their employees enroll in the company health insurance as a condition of employment (and pay their portion of the coverage fee with no opt-out allowed). The insurers assume that the number of people who'll turn down the job solely due to disagreeing with the mandatory-insurance aspect is small, so the coverage pool is in effect a large, mandatory-coverage pool selected for mostly-health-unrelated reasons, which is the kind that works as a risk pool.<p>Entrepreneurs don't have anything similar unless there is a way to aggregate themselves into a pool where the opt-ins don't correlate with health condition too strongly, which currently there isn't. Insurers for good reason don't give good terms to non-mandatory-coverage risk pools, because of the strong bias towards high-risk people in such pools. And good luck if you have any congenital health issues; my friend who has a from-birth heart defect is essentially banned from ever doing a startup due to the employment-tied nature of the U.S. healthcare system and the preexisting-condition rules that make the health-insurance-via-corporate-job approach the only one open to him.",1323487391

But Secretary Rice kept saying that the tubes were evidence of efforts at uranium separation.  In fact, as eventually did come out in the media, the tubes were to be bodies of crude rockets.  Then W said ""tubes"" in his big speech.  The media didn't clarify the situation and loudly call BS.<p>The uranium from Niger was maybe not real after all but even if real likely not very important:  As I recall, that uranium chemical is a standard industrial item.  E.g., one use of uranium is to color plastic lenses for cars or some such.  Getting uranium is not so tough; enriching it enough for a bomb is.  Running a uranium reactor is not so tough; getting the plutonium, 239 as I recall, and don't want 240 or some such, is tougher.  Then to separate the plutonium, use just chemical means.  Then to compress it enough to have a critical mass is tricky and likely needs some testing, and tests are now essentially impossible to hide.<p>The media should have helped make it clear that the evidence that Saddam was close to any very serious WMDs was very thin stuff.<p>W invaded Iraq on very thin stuff.  The media should have made that fact very clear to the voters.<p>Okay, maybe we should have dumped Saddam.  Maybe.  I would have tried making him an offer he couldn't refuse, but maybe we're not supposed to do that.  So, maybe we should have dumped him.<p>Getting to Baghdad took, what, 23 days?  Then the big mistake started:  Bremer decided to do 'nation building'.  And his first step was to fire the Iraqi army -- dumb, dumb, dumb.  Nearly every common thug criminal, gang leader, organized crime leader, terrorist leader, out of work soldier, Shiite leader, Sunni leader, Kurdish leader, Iranian politician, etc. saw how dumb it was and took advantage.  Nearly the only one in Iraq who didn't 'get it' was Bremer.<p>Our media didn't keep us informed.<p>On China, it's simple:  Our media didn't keep us informed.  We still don't know the actual flows.  First cut we need to know the flows.<p>Sometimes the media is silent; sometimes they pay attention to an important topic but make a mess, out of bias or just sloppy work; often they assume that the audience wouldn't want to know; usually it's just a lot cheaper to do sloppy reporting.  Whatever, we're, net, getting the mushroom treatment from the media -- keep us in the dark and feed us BS.<p>Actually likely and apparently quite a lot of quite solid information is available.  Likely a lot of it is on the Internet.  I keep looking and hoping to find good sources although finding them is not my full time job.<p>I upchuck at FOX, NYT, LAT, WaPo, ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, CNN, PBS, and about everything else I can find.  Law, medicine, engineering, etc.  -- in none of these do we try to get by with the mushroom treatment we get from the media.  If an airplane were designed with the information quality of the media, then it'd never get off the ground which, net, would be a good thing.<p>My concern is not partisanship but stupidity.<p>As voting citizens, we need solid information.

I don't know about depending on x86 instructions, but I like the idea of NaCl.  I think it's pretty clear that the web needs some kind of low-level VM that's closer to the metal than JavaScript.  It's been argued that LLVM isn't the answer, so maybe PNaCl is on the way out, but overall I think NaCl makes sense in Google's strategy: they want to see web apps take over.  They want the web to replace Windows and OS X.  Therefore it's natural that they want to download native or near-native code to the browser, and NaCl is just a way to do it safely.  It's _not_ the same thing as ActiveX, I really believe that.  However, it's clear that it's necessary to be extremely careful, and I'm not convinced they need to go 100% native -- I think a solution like PNaCl is more along the right lines.  Web apps and games are not going away, and I think it's clear that we need something easier to statically optimize than JavaScript as the runtime system for the web.",1323486835

3981475,comment,3981167,3981428,5,0,objclxt,,,"Absolutely - what's not clear at all is where the liability lies. In the UK at least, and I assume the rest of Europe, if a retailer uses a PIN the liability for fraud rests with the card issuer.<p>But if the retailer lets the user sign instead the liability is with them: this is an incentive for retailers to accept and promote Chip/PIN over a signature.<p>iZettle read the chip (good), but then you sign for the goods (bad). It's not at all clear if that means liability for fraud now rests with the seller rather than the issuer. Their help page is very vague on the subject, and alludes to the fact card issuers won't allow PINs to be captured on mobile devices (this makes some sense, from a phishing perspective).<p>In fact, iZettle's help page has <i>zero</i> results when you search for 'fraud'. I think this is something they should address.<p>Coincidentally (shameless plug here), I blogged about this exact problem a month or so ago, bemoaning the lack of a good Chip & PIN solution. I'm not convinced iZettle is it...I've now written up some more concerns about fraud in a new post, here: <a href=""http://cleveryou.net/post/23162180527/izettle-square-killer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cleveryou.net/post/23162180527/izettle-square-killer</a>",1337165838

This is why Google bought Doubleclick.<p>The US online ad market today is $32B. Growing at 8-12% per year (some estimate 25%) this year.<p>What is happening is old display advertising dollars are moving online, and it is happening a lot quicker than anybody thought it would. Online will overtake print this year (print will continue to shrink 8-10% p.a). TV is worth about $60B per year. Local ad spending is being hurt the most and is also the largest, bringing in around $140-160B per year.<p>So the trends are old advertising money moving into online. Online making up 20% of all ad spending last year to forecast ~35% next year. Print and local shrinking, and within online advertising display advertising is now larger and growing quicker than search advertising.<p>Knowing these trends, adapt this back to working out the companies that stand to gain. Facebook currently has the most time spent online for any website. It will be the largest display advertising inventory pool. People are no longer reading magazines, or newspapers or flicking through the Yellow Pages but rather they are spending a lot more time on the web. Spending a lot more time on the web for most average people, at the moment, means spending time on Facebook.<p>Being bullish on Facebook, i'd much rather that they be in the position of dominating user time and having a shitty ad product, than having a great ad product and losing user time.<p>Search advertising may be a lot more efficient and profitable, but display advertising is still king. It is a lot easier to create display advertising inventory than it is for search. Google moving into display advertising is all you need to know.<p>Facebook can fix the ad product and experiment with it over time, finding a way to best adapt those offline dollars to online display advertising. Building a site with a bilion users and a pretty good moat is a lot more difficult.",1337162796

Newspapers played a major role in educating the people about the Revolution and passing around the text of the Declaration of Independence, Articles of Confederation, and Constitution, so no, it was not reasonable for some people not to learn to read 200 years ago.<p>By the way, if Gutenberg's Printing Revolution made the written word so cheap that pamphlets could be handed out to as many people as possible, I don't think there would have been many who could not afford books 200 years ago. If there were many who didn't use the reading skill much, then there wouldn't have been all the hoopla over the Stamp Act the British imposed on the American colonies. You sorta need to know how to read to make any use of stamps 200 years ago.<p><a href=""http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/literacy-rates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/literacy-rates</a>",1337162772

It's unlikely that it works in video tags and even if it did, it would not provide a very good user experience. Maybe in ideal conditions.<p>Bittorrent does not download files sequentially from the beginning to the end, but it grabs a piece here, a piece there.

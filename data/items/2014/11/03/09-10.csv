That money gets him funds to buy tractors and plows and other productivity boosters or maybe self driving combines to just outright replace some of his labor.<p>Now while a lot of that might come from the same western market, he will still spend some of it locally, and macroeconomically that effect will spread wealth in the local area assuming locals can buy <i>something</i> from each other.

Until recently (two months back), I was part of Ministry of Corporate Affairs, which completely eliminated paper for company registration. The implementation project started sometime in 2006 and was rolled out pan-India by 2008. Since 2009, no physical paper is used for registration; all are done electronically. Company registration in India now takes a week which used to take 3 months until 2006. It&#x27;s a huge success. Similar thing is done for Passports too.",1415005728

In fact is seems that correcting for the different start positions of both economies (marshall plan in the west vs. reparations in the east) explains pretty much all the difference that was appearent in the late 80s. (see e.g. &quot;Das Scheitern des Realsozialismus&quot; by Steinitz).<p>I&#x27;m not sure why that trope is so successful, but one reason could be the that from the viewpoint of someone from the western parts of Germany looking at the eastern parts, what catches the eye is the abysimal effiency of the micro economical structures, as micro economical effiency is something a market economy shines at. The macro economical aspects are not that appearent for an observer because apart from monetary policy macro economies aren&#x27;t part of the western political discourse. But Eastern Germany had a planned economy, e.g. the focus laid on the <i>macro</i> economical development, and macro economical growth was indeed consistently higher than in Western Germany from the 50s until the 80s.<p><i>It took billions of euros to alone fix the environmental damage, e.g. in Bitterfeld </i><p>...as it did in Western Germany in the 80s. Haven&#x27;t you seen the pictures of the massive acid rain damages of the black forest in Western Germany?

In the east, a new political and economic system replaced what was there before. 40 years means roughly two generations of socialism under soviet leadership. Both parts of Germany were developing into role models for their political systems. A lot of structural change took place in the east.<p>It&#x27;s also always astonishing how very little basic views change over time in people. I can well remember that many of the generation who grew up before or during WWII was anti-semitic views long after the Third Reich. Even people who were not active racists had them. The Third Reich was responsible for some, but some views were very old (see for example Martin Luther <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_and_antisemitism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_and_antisemitism</a> ).<p>For some change the previous generations have to die away, but there are underlying views which are hard to change even between generations.<p>> Germans are known for doing or thinking what they&#x27;re told<p>Well, actually communism was a German invention. You may have heard of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and others. The particular combination of Racism and National Socialism / Fascism was also a home-grown development. A working model of democracy had to be explained to us, though. It took a few decades in West Germany to make it work, put the results were positive.",1415005363

This means that there is, absent physically destructive attacks or side-channel vulnerabilities in the key derivation circuitry, no way to recover the UID/PUF output.  Since PUFs typically get their values from random process variation, their values cannot be known before manufacturing.  Since it can be <i>used</i>, in very well-defined operations with inherent rate limiting, but cannot be read out directly, there is no economically-feasible way to recover their values after manufacturing, either.<p>Of course, this is mostly speculation and would need some serious ChipWorks-style reverse engineering to determine if it&#x27;s true, but that&#x27;s my impression given what I&#x27;ve read from Apple&#x27;s security documentation.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.nxp.com/documents/other/75017366.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nxp.com/documents/other/75017366.pdf</a>",1415005353

One woman&#x27;s blog is not proof of much, however, press embargos are BAU for NASA missions, PIs get a year to publish before the results are public, however media coverage disappears a couple hours after mission events.  So at least in mass &quot;push&quot; media, the data is never distributed beyond occasional PR team low res footage.<p>It would not be surprising if press/publicity stuff works the same for archeology missions as NASA missions, after all they&#x27;re all academia employed PHDs trying to get published in journals, so convergent evolution and all that.<p>All the data is eventually released &quot;somewhere&quot; usually on a public website, but it takes awhile.",1433710774

9676335,comment,9671783,9675907,0,0,JnRouvignac,,,"Interesting question. What would prevent this to happen indeed?<p>One reason I can think of is that for GCC all input languages are converted to the same intermediate representation (IR). From there, it&#x27;s easy to apply the same optimisations, generated code, etc.<p>For refactoring tools, I have never heard of such IR. The benefits of going for an IR are not obvious either. The drawbacks are huge: a lot more code, difficulty to build an IR rich enough to represent the semantics of all input languages, and there&#x27;s an extra mapping to go back to the original code by keeping indentation and formatting.<p>While it is more obvious for GCC: you need another representation than the AST to compile to assembly, optimisations are run on the IR, there is no need to take care of the original source formatting.<p>Languages also have very subtle differences in meaning/behaviour making it harder to reuse refactorings across languages.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s possible to go with your idea, but I think it would require a big team working on it. Who&#x27;s willing to spend the money or the time when the current approach seems satisfactory?",1433710341

9676332,comment,9674286,9675588,0,0,tel,,,"One way to look at this is to note ask what exactly it meant when you said &quot;a sphere of volume&quot;. In the real world it&#x27;s ultimately impossible to imagine spaces which don&#x27;t have volume of some kind or another, but in mathematics we often study models of the world too sparse to even have &quot;measurability&quot;. These are obviously aphysical, but it turns out that when one tries to construct reality via set theory you have to go through a zone of &quot;funky aphysical things&quot; before you reject them all and consider only measurable things.<p>BT exists just before we make that last transition and abuses the fact that the constructions we&#x27;ve made so far are not required to have any reasonable sense of &quot;volume&quot; whatsoever. All of the &quot;infinity&quot; bits are sort of a red herring as there&#x27;s no reasonable way to think about taking physical things and cutting them into aphysical things. Instead, this all arises from taking incredibly aphysical things (raw, theoretical sets) and building them up until they feel physical.<p>If you lay out the constraint that &quot;cuts&quot; must divide measurable things into measurable things, which is a reasonable expectation we have of physical items, then BT will vanish.",1433710281

9676319,comment,9675684,9675684,0,0,maceo,,,"As much as I admire many of the people working towards divestment from fossil fuel companies, I think the whole movement is defeatist. Great, you convince your university endowment fund, pension fund, etc to divest -- now what? Now those shares will be bought and controlled by an institution that is immune from popular pressure. Who wins here? Nobody.<p>On the other hand, if instead of agitating for divestment, the students/workers/activists were to ask for proxy votes, then we could put up a real fight at shareholder meetings. Sure, we might not have enough power to elect board members in the early stages, but nothing builds a movement more than meeting up with like-minded people and confronting the enemy face to face. It would provide a forum for activists to make connections with one another, grow the movement, and get excited about the possibility of fighting climate change by being an engaged citizen.<p>It&#x27;s heart-breaking to me to see so much support given to this divestment movement -- I&#x27;ve never seen any of the major figures involved give a justification for why we should be divesting rather than fighting the corporations head on. Especially since proxy fights have a history of driving movement growth in the US. Divestment is a retreat. If climate change is really as much of a threat as most of us know it to be, then retreating should not be an option.",1433710022

They, however, don&#x27;t have many political or scientific beliefs, and their intelligences lie elsewhere than scientific or conceptual thinking.

People are also more sensitive to the worst case failure modes of a nuclear plant (which has happened like once in history) than they are to the failure modes of coal power (which are when they function like they&#x27;re designed to).",1433709420

What it does is eat's away at fortunes that stick with ultra safe investments in favor of the risk takers.  Because I don't think income / wealth inequality is inherently bad, what's dangerous is type of back room deals /networks that favor 'old' money.<p>In the end I don't think there is much you can do to prevent   insider deals, but you can put a damper on what it means for your great, great, grand father to have built a modest fortune that was managed reasonably well after that.<p>PS: I have plenty of rich relatives, heck my grandmother went to Harvard and one of my closet friends growing up came from 'old' money with multi million dollar trust funds so I may be a little to close to be objective on this one.  But, on net I don't have a lot of good things to say about what happens when your parents inherit wealth and you can look forward to more of the same.",1332183594

Sometimes those prejudices are trivial (""oh, he cares about external noise and so do I"") but often they are windows through which more serious cultural and gender prejudices sneak in.<p>I mean, so if the interviewee says that healthcare is incredibly important because they have a sick child, that doesn't tell you anything at all about how well they'll do at the job (but hiring managers often have strong feelings one way or another about the importance of family).

Even after all this debate, I feel no need to agree or disagree with the statement. I'm perfectly satisfied feeling that it is plausible.<p>Now I'm going to stick my neck out, because this is the part I'm trying to understand:<p>Perhaps you view statements like that as an attempted declaration of scientific fact. From that perspective, it's perfectly reasonable to respond ""Woah cowboy, slow down! Either break this down for me or at least cite some references here, because that's a provocative statement"". I bet that if pg had also written an essay on ""Ideas and Writing Well"", even that is a citation you would find useful, it wouldn't have to come from Aristotle.<p>Apologies if I am guessing wrong here, but if that is the way you view it: you are not wrong, I am not wrong, and pg is not wrong. We're just viewing the same statement differently.<p>I'm willing to bet that this is a subject pg has considered deeply. And from his perspective, I'm certain his statement is true. The criteria for ""good writing"" is definitely an opinion, and his is probably a well considered opinion. Your opinion could even be diametrically opposed, and that wouldn't make either of you wrong. It would just mean that you disagree. And that's perfectly OK.<p>It was your comment about the lack of references that hit me like a punch in the nose. From my perspective, that seemed to come way out of left field.

If it is assessed as a threat by whatever definition the government in question decides to use, and it is either in geo-stationary orbit above a country or in high altitude, it will be forcibly removed by the air force.

Good books are supposed to do this too, but sometimes you don't have the flexibility to choose the best books. Also, as in any story, you have high points and low; important bits and those less so. Emphasizing these differences and making sure students understand which are the central points is another main goal of good lectures.<p>2. Explaining difficult concepts in different (often multiple) ways so that people can understand them better. For various reasons, books have a tendency to avoid ""intuitive"" explanations for many concepts, perhaps out of a fear of not-quite-perfect analogies. Such analogies can be given in class with the appropriate qualifications; doing the same in a book would often require excessive legalese.<p>Where appropriate, these explanations often involve visual elements -- animations usually, and not just pictures (which you can of course include in books).",1332181597

3725311,comment,3724429,3724429,13,0,grellas,,,"For those who are not categorically opposed to the idea of copyright (I am not), this case illustrates both the good and the bad of the current system.<p>Copyright when properly applied ultimately protects creative forms of expression (see <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3479959"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3479959</a>). It does so by giving the originator of a creative work (the ""author"") a monopoly on it for a limited time, the effect of which is to allow that person to control who can copy it, alter it, etc. Because the goal is to protect creativity, copyright cannot legitimately be used to give anyone a monopoly over ideas themselves (such as the idea of transposing pi to musical notes), or over expressions of ideas that are indistinguishable from the underlying ideas themselves, or over standard or stock elements (e.g., stock character types in plays), or over facts. Even if a work itself is properly copyrighted, that protection extends <i>only</i> to the elements of that work that are sufficiently original as to be protectible and not to other elements. Thus, if someone claims infringement and the only concrete similarities between two works relate to elements not protected by copyright (e.g., facts or ideas), there can be no infringement. Applying these rules here, a judge well-versed in copyright law held that pi is a non-copyrightable fact, the transcription of pi to music is a non-copyrightable idea, the resulting pattern of notes is an expression that merges with the non-copyrightable idea of transcribing pi to music, and the remaining elements of similarity in the two works are so incidental and scattered that there is no way it can be said that the works are <i>substantially</i> similar - hence, no infringement can be found even if the works might be found to sound similar in certain ways. In focusing strongly on the underlying principle of what copyright is all about (to protect original forms of creative expression), the judge held that the ""Pi Symphony"" creator, though possibly holding a valid copyright on his overall work, was entitled to protect that work against only virtually identical copying because any broader form of legal protection would allow that creator to overreach and to claim what would amount essentially to a monopoly over the very concept of transposing pi to music. This is what older generations would have called a ""felicitous result"" - one that allows creative work to be legally protected within the strict limits justified by the purpose of the copyright law and no more. The result comports with both law and common sense and is well-articulated by this judge in a solid opinion. That is the good part.<p>The bad part is that an Oregon resident had to fight a federal lawsuit, first in the distant forum of Nebraska in order to challenge jurisdiction and venue, and then through what was undoubtedly a set of motions in Oregon that had to cost at least tens of thousands of dollars. For big companies, maybe this is reasonable but, for an average person trying to defend against this sort of attack, the process itself becomes obnoxious. This is a big reason that IP bullying can be so easily practiced and why so many have to cave to it - even if they are in the right. In a digital age, such bullying has become even more obnoxious, driving many to the point of despising copyright altogether in spite of its historic purposes and merits.",1332180801

I.e. ""factor of 5"" = 2 bits of security.<p>* 2 bits of security is not significant at all.<p>* The Scrypt x5000 seems to only apply when your attacker has access to a chip foundry and it buys you maybe about 12 bits of security against such an attacker.<p>* For comparison, 128 bits of security is often considered a minimum for resisting offline bruteforce attacks (e.g. AES has a 128 bit key). Of course passwords usually don't come anywhere near close to 128 bits of effective security, so 12 bits might make the difference for some of them if you're lucky.<p>* In a sense, table 1 in the Scrypt paper shows that the relative difference between the functions is less significant than even relatively small variations in password strength. When the defender has 100ms of CPU to spend authenticating each password, all three functions compared cost less than $200 to break an 8 letter password and more than $150M to break a 10 character password.<p>* Very few attackers are going to actually spend $M++ trying to break your password (cue XKCD strip). A relevant exception might be botnets, the operators of which don't pay the power bill for their computations.<p>Therefore, I conclude that for most purposes these functions are mostly equivalent and quality-of-implementation and password strength issues dominate in practice.",1332180645

The hard part of designing a good hash function is achieving collision-resistance; one-wayness is easy. In this context, we don't really care about collision-resistance, since HMAC can be a PRF without collision resistance of the underlying hash (there was a recent proof by Mihir Bellare) --- this is why it's still ""OK"" to use HMAC-MD5, despite MD5 being completely broken otherwise. The adage that we know much more about ciphers than hashes, although still mostly true, is an exaggeration at this point in time, where we have the HAIFA mode, good block ciphers, and soon SHA-3.<p>I didn't mean to say that Joe the webdev would be choosing the PRF, that's insane. But whoever providing the (library) implementation would have their life facilitated by having modular primitives, instead of having to code another construct from the ground up.<p>Edit: True, the AES competition was a much higher-profile event. There is an important difference (this is not a rebuttal, but a remark): AES is a cipher, PBKDF is a construction. AES has no proof of security, nor hope of one: it's a purely heuristic security argument. Through models like the random oracle, however, we could show that the PBKDF construction is secure, if H is secure. In such a case, there is not as much need for a competition, unless you're competing for performance or the like. That said, I would <i>love</i> proofs of security (or show the lack thereof) for PBKDF2.",1332180464

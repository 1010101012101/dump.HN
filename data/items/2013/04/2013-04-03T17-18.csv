5487776,comment,5487511,5487511,122,0,octo_t,,,"Here's how fucked the games business is: Tomb Raider sold 3.5 million units in 4 weeks, and yet failed to meet sales expectations. Hitman sold the same, and Sleeping Dogs sold 1.75 million and they both failed to meet expectations. Square Enix lost over $150m last year, despite those three critically and commercially (by any reasonable metric) games coming out. Despite selling millions of copies they aren't profitable because game budgets are too high.<p>EA thinks that next gen budgets will be ""only""10% higher than this gen. That means that gmaes need to sell <i>at least</i> 10% more units than current games are doing, and eren that will only guarantee the losses of tens of millions we're seeing now. To be profitable they'll need to sell far far more. On consoles that, because they are new, will have a limited user base anyway. Either that or raise the price to make up the shortfall. In the middle of the longest recession in a century.<p>The industry is <i>fucked</i><p>The only way to make money from games is what Disney have done, license the IP to other companies and get them to pay for it.",1365011983

In equities markets, shorting is possible because the broker can force the borrower to cover and return the borrowed security.  The broker can in turn resort to another layer of force in legal recourse if the borrower doesn't have sufficient cash deposited with the broker.<p>In Bitcoin, no entity can ever compel another to spend bitcoins (to the protocol, anything like asset seizure or any other method of surrendering a bitcoin is spending.)  So the short-seller can walk away and never cover a short position that went badly, and the lender never receives back his bitcoins.  For Bitcoin shorting to exist requires a broker with some way of enforcing non-Bitcoin power over the short-seller, perhaps a deposit in a fiat currency or some other kind of collateral.

5487729,comment,5487316,5487431,4,0,jfim,,,"It's pretty much what they have been saying all along; Heroku switched to random routing to support other stacks than only Rails and they kept the routing infrastructure between Cedar and Bamboo the same, resulting in an undocumented performance degradation for large customers still on the old stack or running non-concurrent web frameworks on the new one. The last part was an oversight on Heroku's part, but the rest makes sense, especially considering Cedar supports other stacks than just Rails, including massively concurrent ones(Nodejs, Play, etc.).<p>The rest of the whole thing was people who were unsatisfied by the change and wanted the old product offering to return and/or felt shortchanged by Heroku. Luckily, Heroku doesn't lock you into their platform like GAE does, for example; it's essentially a bunch of shell scripts to deploy binaries on EC2 workers, a hosted instance of Postgres on EC2, some routing and ops as a service. Anyone who wasn't happy about the change could've contacted Heroku to say ""you said we would be sold non-random routing, but you've sold us random routing"" or moved their app away to another provider or even their own servers.<p>Does this suck if you wanted the old service? Sure. Witness the flak that the canning of Google Reader got and it's obvious that discontinuing old services isn't exactly a popular decision. On the other hand, you can self-host (it's massively cheaper than Heroku) or switch to another provider. And if there are no other providers that specialize in Rails hosting, isn't that a business opportunity?",1365011608

5487727,comment,5486398,5487600,6,0,betterunix,,,"You cannot talk about a market without talking about trade; in the original context of the law, money was traded for child pornography, and that was the entire justification.  Open source, Youtube, and HN comments are <i>not</i> a market.<p>It is important to remember that child pornography is <i>evidence of a crime</i>.  People do not send that evidence to others without receiving compensation of some sort; the knowledge that others are looking at the images is <i>knowledge that they have evidence of the crime</i>.  The people who commit crimes against children are very secretive, and those who produce child pornography often go to great lengths to remain undetected.  It is clear from what is known about online child pornography exchanges that trade of some kind is occurring, often serving a dual-role of compensation and of filtering out law enforcement officers.<p>That is the real issue:  these people know that once their photos and videos spread around, the police will become aware of them.  Rather than knowing that people enjoy their work, what the producers of child pornography know is that their work can lead to their arrest.  They are exchanging it because they are receiving enough in return to justify such risks.<p>The original legal justification for the censorship of child pornography was to remove that compensation, since the police were having so much trouble locating child pornography producers.  My point is that that justification is now badly in need of review, because the majority of people guilty of child pornography possession did not compensate the producers in any way.  I have no problem with raids on forums where child pornography is exchanged quid pro quo; my problem is with raids on people suspected of downloading child pornography from peer to peer networks or third/fourth/fifth/etc. hand websites that are many levels removed from the producers.

Most of my colleagues, including those with many years of experience, have salaries in the 30-40K range, so that average starting salary of 35K seems about right or even slightly high. By the way, this is in Los Angeles, where the cost of living is relatively high. Incidentally, the more highly trained postdocs might even have worse salaries and potentially the worst prospects because the number of available faculty positions have seemed to decrease over the years.<p>Programmer/analysts do make more, but not nearly as much as they would in VC-istan. The median starting salary for a programmer/analyst at my institution is 50K. Senior programmer/analysts can make as much as a median 116K, but I almost never see people employed at that level despite their capability. More importantly, at least in life science research at a public institution, there's really no guarantee that you'll be kept on past the duration of the grant you're funded from, unless your PI is famous and your lab's rich. Even so, the recent cascade of NIH and NSF cuts are putting pressure on all labs.<p>Along those lines -- the job insecurity's the worst for junior staff, so I don't really see any good reason for recent grads to continue in public research. Most of my former grad school classmates are now in private pharma or biotech. I'm personally looking to move from life science to the SF tech scene as soon as I graduate this year.<p>Edit: clarity",1365010782

5487436,comment,5486920,5486920,3,0,rm999,,,"This is pretty similar to the approach that many predictive modelers already use: compress data down into 'dummy variables', where each variable represents some attribute. For example, you could convert the variable state into 51 dummy variables, one for california, one for DC, etc. Hashing makes the programming a little easier and helps avoid throwing out data in the long-tail of the distribution when the number of possible values is very high. It's common in NLP exactly because of this.<p>Hashing comes with costs though. It's much harder to interpret a model with hashed variables because the variables lose meaning. Also, some information may get thrown out; as OP mentions integers may have continuous meaning and categorizing them can really damage the model. If you have a very large dataset it probably won't matter because most modeling methods asymptotically converge (i.e. as you have more and more data the model can learn that 333 and 334 are similar just by seeing enough examples that this is the case), but if you don't you could be throwing out valuable information. In a case like this I suppose the modeler could manually go in and convert his integers to floats to 'tell' the algorithm the data is continuous.",1365009584

5487297,comment,5481101,5484334,1,0,btilly,,,"What is wrong with STL iterators?  To see the shortcomings, let's dream up a better one and then compare.<p>Our hypothetical interface to iterators will have the following methods:<p>bool not_done();  // Is the iterator done?<p>void next(); // Move to the next value.  Throws exception if done.<p>Foo value(); // What value do we have?  Throws exception if done.<p>Our data structures will support the method iterator() that is the moral equivalent of begin().<p>We already have the equivalent of STL iterators.  You just change:<p>for (data_structure::iterator it = foo.begin(); it != foo.end(); ++it) { /* do stuff with <i>it </i>/ }<p>to<p>for (iterator< fooish > it = foo.iterator(); it.not_done(); it.next()) { /* do stuff with it.value() */ }<p>So far uninteresting.  But with this new interface we can add four interesting templates in a straightforward matter.<p>1. Take an iterator< fooish > and a function that maps things of type fooish to type barish, then produce an iterator< barish >.<p>2. Take an iterator< fooish >, and a function that maps fooish to bool, then produces an iterator that gives you just the ones that mapped to true.<p>3. (Generalization of the first two.)  Take an iterator that produces things of type fooish, and a function that maps fooish to iterator< barish >, and returns an iterator< barish > that just maps each value from the first to all of the bars that it produces.<p>4. Take an object with a method that produces things of type fooish, and produce an iterator< fooish >.<p>These are all simple to define given this interface.  What do they allow us to do?  Well the article that introduced me to the idea of iterators was <a href=""http://perl.plover.com/Stream/stream.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perl.plover.com/Stream/stream.html</a> - absolutely everything in that article is straightforward with the interface that I described and absolutely none of it is easy with STL iterators.  (It is all still actually possible, but tricky.  Proving that fact is left as an exercise to the reader, at which point you'll know why people don't tend to think about problems that way in C++.)",1365008408

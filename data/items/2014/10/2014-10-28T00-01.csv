one, run it through a beam splitter, take the
two halves, and put one in a lab that is standing
still and has a <i>normal</i> clock and the other half
in a moving lab, a space ship, with a <i>slow</i> clock.<p>But, we want the wave function to be of a particle
that also has a clock.  So, let the wave function
be that of an atom of a radioactive element 
with a short half
life.<p>We get in our space ship and travel at, say,
90% of the speed of light, let the particle
go, let it encounter the beam splitter, let
one half of the wave function continue to
bounce around inside our space ship with a
slow clock and let the other half exit the
space ship through a window, enter the
lab that is standing still, and bounce around there.<p>Then the question is, what is the half life of the
particle?  Is the expected time, in the clock
of the normal lab, to decay different for decays in the
space ship than that for decays in the lab that is
not moving?<p>I&#x27;m sure this is all wet in some sense, but

8519004,comment,8515424,8518423,0,0,MBCook,,,"> Why in the world do you tell Fitbit that you are a) going to sleep, and then b) you are now getting up?<p>It made more sense on the FitBit One, the previous device. It had to go in a special arm band at night to do that feature.<p>At this point I <i>hate</i> this feature because I accidentally press the button on my One and it decides that means I sleep-walked for 6 hours in the middle of the day. There is no way to turn the tracking off totally, I just have to watch and remove the errant data when I accidentally trigger it.<p>> With my Shine, I can replace the standard 2032 battery every three months. So I replace it, and forget it. With Fitbit, I&#x27;d have to take it off every 4 days or so (depending on usage). The &quot;lasts a week&quot; thing is a lie.<p>My FitBit One lasts a week, but it&#x27;s a bigger device and could hold more battery. The &#x27;children&#x27;s FitBit&#x27; (the Zip?) also does the 2032 battery thing and lasts months.<p>> I have the Aria too, that product I still like, and I still use the Fitbit app just for that. I wish that could integrate with Healthkit.<p>Sort of possible. FitBit -> My Fitness Pal -> HealthKit.",1414457848

You can always grab large chunks of memory and perform allocation out of it yourself with decent performance and some determinism or pre-allocate space on the stack before calling a function to allow it to pass back a limited amount of dynamic data. Memory allocators are designed for good performance in most cases, but given a more specific case, you can usually do something better yourself :-)",1414457321

The framework I use is from the year 2040, it communicates with itself in the past so it&#x27;s able to learn instantaneously.<p>The history of the framework shows that on many different projects it actually just waited until people completed the project, then sent a signal back through time to inform itself. But then, the internal history shows that many parts were eventually replaced by an AI that wrote the whole app.<p>It seems from what I was able to gather about its source code, some parts of it are in a quantum flux, with their waveform never collapsing.

8518934,comment,8514761,8518299,0,0,theoh,,,"And would it be ethical? Hand Moravec has written disturbingly about this issue:
&quot;So is there no difference between being cruel to characters in interactive books or video games and people one meets in the street? Books or games act on a reader&#x27;s future only via the mind, and actions within them are mostly reversed if the experience is forgotten. Physical actions, by contrast, have greater significance because their consequences spread irreversibly. If past physical events could be easily altered, as in some time-travel stories, if one could go back to prevent evil or unfortunate deeds, real life would acquire the moral significance of a video game. A more disturbing implication is that any sealed-off activity, whose goings on can be forgotten, may be in the video game category. Creators of hyperrealistic simulations---or even secure physical enclosures---containing individuals writhing in pain are not necessarily more wicked than authors of fiction with distressed characters, or myself, composing this sentence vaguely alluding to them. The suffering preexists in the underlying Platonic worlds; authors merely look on. The significance of running such simulations is limited to their effect on viewers, possibly warped by the experience, and by the possibility of ``escapees&#x27;&#x27;---tortured minds that could, in principle, leak out to haunt the world in data networks or physical bodies. Potential plagues of angry demons surely count as a moral consequence. In this light, mistreating people, intelligent robots, or individuals in high-resolution simulations has greater moral significance than doing the same at low resolution or in works of fiction not because the suffering individuals are more real---they are not---but because the probability of undesirable consequences in our own future is greater.&quot;

What I&#x27;m saying is that if Democrats can get people without photo ID registered to vote and get them to the polls, they could also help anyone lacking valid photo ID to get it (although this would be a bit more effort and require a long-term commitment rather than a short-term one that revolved around the electoral calendar). GOTV activists might be in a better position to assist people lacking valid ID than the individuals themselves.<p>My basic point is that if the Democrats committed to ensuring that eligible voters had valid identification they would a) be doing many of the disenfranchised people a big favor that would have a positive impact on their lives in other contexts besides voting, and b) depriving the Republican party of an easy slur that they trot out every single electoral cycle, ie that Democrats are the party of electoral corruption.<p>Photo ID requirements are not the most rational solution to the problem of illegal voting, but politics isn&#x27;t a rational business.",1414455969

The form of the detector determines how the wave function collapses into an observable state.  <i>That&#x27;s</i> when the &quot;choice&quot; gets made.  There is no projection of the choice onto the past; there is only the projection of the choice onto the probability wave function in the present.

As a Vim plugin, it&#x27;s fairly light on the CPU, but with all the expressive power you expect from Vim (including syntax formatting/highlighting and the availability of your other favorite plugins). I like it because I can dedicate a plaintext file to a specific task, develop my queries, save my results, and come back to it at a later date if the need arises. Some of these files are an important part of my workflow. The only thing I&#x27;d change is a more secure handling of login credentials, but it sure beats the standard command line tools bundled with most databases and requires less overhead than the GUI or web-based ones.",1414454744

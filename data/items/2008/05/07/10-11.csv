The people with the money see us as 'too risky', basically they are really stupid.\nWe've had to become super sales guys just to get them to even listen to us or even read the Executive Summary!\nIt's a strange and bizarre journey. Great to read what you have said, it confirms what we thought.\nI suppose the strategy is to focus more on Angel Investors - something we need to look at more now. www.ibodnet.com",1210156402

Spending more than five seconds on this (before you have data), and even worse, involving more than one person, is a recipe for fail.<p>People just love to argue about silly shit like this.<p>Homework assignment for everyone who felt compelled to chime in with their well-reasoned opinions:<p><a href=""http://www.bikeshed.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bikeshed.com/</a>",1210155485

If people use your service for less than five minutes per day then 100 daily users would mostly have the system to themselves. This means that you could have thousands of registered users and grossly inefficient code without load issues.<p>Stop fretting about your hardware and get thousands of registered users.",1210155263

183283,comment,183169,183247,0,0,demallien,,,"This is probably the direction that we need to be taking.  Another requirement that we have is that the code compiles without warnings for about 20 different target platforms.  This takes hours, and we are currently writing a tool to parallelise those builds - we're hoping for a 20x speed increase. Maybe a similar approach could be achieved for running tests...",1210154821
183282,comment,183169,183273,0,0,demallien,,,"In practice we run a subset of tests during development, but the current rule is that we should never checkin code that hasn't passed ALL of the unit tests.  The idea being that each person is responsable for their own modifications passing all tests.  If you check-in, and then get shifted onto another high priority task, and a later run of the unit tests discovers that a funky side effect from your changes breaks the unit tests, you are no longer available to fix the problem. Someone else has to do it, allowing you to escape responsability for your error.  At least, that's the theory management here ascribes to...",1210154695

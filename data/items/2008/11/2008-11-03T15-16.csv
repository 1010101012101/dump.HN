Websites should realise that users don't mind them making money -- in fact most users want their web hosts to be financially secure, as that means they'll continue to provide the service -- and that users know that websites need to make money, from advertising, or subscription fees or some other method.",1225727948

If it was in Europe, it would be 4 euro instead?<p>Why 3.99 and not 3.56, since credit card payments don't care anyway?<p>In any case, congrats to weebly whose profitability enables this discussion.",1225727845

A print ad costs a few thousand dollars and you're not guaranteed any visitors.<p>One thing I learned about print ads is the price is very very negotiable. Start with a price so far below their asking price that you feel embarrassed. The list price for magazine ads can be several times greater than the price they're willing to settle on, especially as deadlines approach.<p>Another good option is to advertise on small niche sites. There are a lot of ""mom and pop"" fantasy sites with cheaper advertising and the exact audience I was looking for.",1225727536

Maybe I missed something when I tried it a couple of months ago but it seemed more like something that had been around for 3 weeks. I really wanted something like it but for sure there wasn't much to it.
Some simple drag and drop features but nothing that let a noob create a cool webpage by just dragging and dropping.<p>Did I manage to miss the point?",1225726710

352141,comment,352057,352057,0,0,nuclear_eclipse,,,"Interesting to note is that the author's experiences are with the UK branch of T-Mobile's customer service, which was likely not as well informed, integrated, or organized as the US division due to locality of Google.<p>However, as a semi-loyal T-Mobile customer myself, I have to agree that the 'buzz generation' and training of local store reps are sub-par for the G1.  None of my local T-Mobile stores had Google reps even on launch day, and only sport a variety of Google-branded posters and a trio of non-functional demo units (one for each color choice).  As of yesterday, one of the display models even had its touch screen broken off, although likely no fault of the unit with the idiots, college students, and unsupervised children that roam the malls here...<p>I'm personally waiting more for Android to start functioning on the Neo Freerunner, which is apparently very close to reality [1], although the developers will still need to solve the input problem, considering the Neo lacks a hardware keyboard, and Android lacks any on-screen input options (which will supposedly be fixed 'soon' by Google).<p>[1] <a href=""http://benno.id.au/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://benno.id.au/blog/</a>",1225726422

The foundations of a good education are far more valuable than most of the minor facts you can gather after that point.  I think the public education system is fairly good up to around 3rd grade but after that it get's much more random.

352130,comment,351724,351989,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>No major artwork was created by a committee.</i><p>Actually, William ""The Princess Bride"" Goldman argues in his famous book about screenwriting (<i>Adventures in the Screen Trade</i>) that <i>all</i> movies are created by committee. He lists a bunch of people that need to do their jobs correctly in order to make a movie any good, starting (obviously) with the screenwriter and the director but also including: The cinematographer, the casting director, the designers and costumers, the film editor, and the composer. To say nothing of the producers, who need to come up with sufficient money or the film doesn't get made.<p>Goldman makes this point in the course of lampooning the ""auteur"" theory of criticism, in which entire films are attributed to the genius of one person -- usually the director. It's because of those auteur theorists that we tend to speak of ""Hitchcock's"" <i>North by Northwest</i>, ignoring the fact that a lot of that film's genius was contributed by Cary Grant, to say nothing of Bernard Herrmann.<p>A great example is <i>Star Wars</i>, which as we all know sprang from the brow of George Lucas. Except, of course, for the parts that were actually created by Ben Burtt (sound designer), John Dykstra (FX supervisor), Rick Baker (makeup artist), Ralph McQuarrie (production illustrator), John Williams (composer), and Richard Chew, Paul Hirsch and Marcia Lucas (film editors). And that's just scratching the surface.<p>A game on the scale of <i>Spore</i> is also, inevitably, created by committee. The question is whether you can keep the committee on the same page. It sounds like Spore's team had some struggles, which had to be mediated, and which were ultimately resolved in a way that isn't quite to my taste. Which is not to say that the enterprise is a failure. It's sold a lot of copies, and no doubt many people are pleased with it. I played with the creature creator, and it <i>was</i> very cute.",1225724907

7217137,comment,7216658,7216806,1,0,ibelong2u,,,"In my opinion, it&#x27;s not. Natural intelligence is another way of saying that dynamics and interactions of millions of neurons in our brain is too complicated for us to understand. Our brain is just a complex machine, and the complexity at the level of its individual components is based on very fundamental laws of physics and chemistry.<p>In that sense, you bring up an excellent question. I don&#x27;t think there exists any unique &quot;natural intelligence&quot; which Hofstadter in the linked article is referring to. Watson is only different from &quot;natural intelligence&quot; in terms of complexity.<p>Conway&#x27;s Game of Life can perhaps be used as an analogy here. The uninitiated is likely to assume a very complex source code upon observing setups like &#x27;spaceships&#x27; and &#x27;glider guns&#x27;. However, it all is based on some very simple rules which can be easily implemented by a high school computer science student.<p>I&#x27;d to extrapolate this logic towards the concept of &#x27;life&#x27; itself. I feel that what we call life is just collective of natural processes too complicated for us to comprehend completely. Scientific research has allowed us to understand biological processes to some extend, but not enough to us to deduce the state of a living entity at t+1 by observing the state at t=0. The common assumption is that there is some independent/supernatural force (consciousness) which allows the living entity to &#x27;chose&#x27; the new state at t+1 (free will).<p>Watson appears to be &quot;intelligently&quot; making a chess move, but as Hofstadter points out, Watson is simply following a set of rules. We can independently calculate Watson&#x27;s move since we know it&#x27;s source code.<p>My conjecture is that if we are theoretically able to capture the complete state of your brain cells at t=0, and understand how they work, I can theoretically calculate your chess play before you make it.<p>For example, check out this White Blood Cell chasing and killing bacteria: \n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnlULOjUhSQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnlULOjUhSQ</a><p>WBC appears to be a living entity, acting out of free will. But the reality is that, molecular composition of WBC is merely attracted to the chemical trail left behind the bacteria, which in turn is repelled by WBC.<p>We do not consider a piece of rock rolling down the hill to be a living entity, because our understanding of physics allows us to calculate the state of a rock at t+1, given it&#x27;s position a t=0.",1392119480

Though thinking it thru, any unsupervised learning would have to have some reference points, be them hard codeded into the core system to ina form of supervised learnings.  Otherwise the AI could recognise a cat but would know it by a completely different name and unless it had been given a good description of a cat to associate with such image forms or a picture with a label.  Then it would never know what a cat was in the way we know them.  Which may be a good or a bad thing.  But if the AI referers to cats as 478912&#x27;s then we would not know what it was on about and whilst it may be intellegent, it would be in a way that we would be unable to understand and relate too.

No. We know there are going to be differences. The catch is that they have to be studied very, very well, with rigor and careful analysis, because they are socially loaded and because science has a deeply deplorable history of using poor methods to reach bad conclusions that are used as ideological props for the status quo.<p>The first of those links has 654 comments, with all sorts of viewpoints ... and a number of references, like from #516:<p>> In this paper, we use meta-analysis to analyze gender differences in recent studies of mathematics performance. First, we meta-analyzed data from 242 studies published between 1990 and 2007, representing the testing of 1,286,350 people. Overall, d = .05, indicating no gender difference, and VR = 1.08, indicating nearly equal male and female variances. Second, we analyzed data from large data sets based on probability sampling of U.S. adolescents over the past 20 years: the NLSY, NELS88, LSAY, and NAEP. Effect sizes for the gender difference ranged between −0.15 and +0.22. Variance ratios ranged from 0.88 to 1.34. Taken together these findings support the view that males and females perform similarly in mathematics.<p>The paper is online for free at <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057475/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057475/</a> , and it highlights the difficulties of doing this research:<p>> These stereotypes are of concern for several reasons. First, in the language of cognitive social learning theory, stereotypes can influence competency beliefs or self-efficacy; correlational research does indeed show that parents&#x27; and teachers&#x27; stereotypes about gender and mathematics predict children&#x27;s perceptions of their own abilities, even with actual mathematics performance controlled (Bouchey & Harter, 2005; Frome & Eccles, 1998; Keller, 2001; Tiedemann, 2000). ... A second concern is that stereotypes can have a deleterious effect on actual performance. Stereotype threat effects (Steele, 1997; Steele & Aronson, 1995) have been found for women in mathematics. ... Stereotypes play a role in policy decisions as well as personal decision-making. For example, schools and states may base decisions to offer single-sex mathematics classes on the belief that these gender differences exist (Arms, 2007).<p>Note that these two confounding cultural effects are not genetic, and seemingly much stronger than any biologically-based difference which might exist.",1392118976

It has a hack that avoids deafening people unexpectedly on most hardware, but at the expense of very audible volume glitches every time it decides to fiddle with the global volume.<p>(Also, thanks to inconvenient analog issues like component tolerances, the most reliable way for hardware to deal with PulseAudio&#x27;s flat volumes is to provide no volume controls except for a single digital one that simply undoes all of PulseAudio&#x27;s weird fiddling.

For instance, the latest PulseAudio release includes a patch that contained incomplete changes that broke various resamplers but was included anyway. It&#x27;ll be reverted in the next major release which will include other half-baked changes. (It turns out that wasn&#x27;t even the cause of the crashes I was experiencing; even before that patch it was broken in a way that meant just having the official volume control application open caused random crashes. I think anyway - unfortunately, all the variable names are misleading and the comments non-existent, so it&#x27;s impossible to be sure what the code&#x27;s meant to do.)",1392116590

Ketamine in high but still sub-anesthetic doses induces a semi-conscious state referred to as the &quot;k-hole&quot;, more or less giving the appearance of being passed out. At lower doses it does strongly effect balance and coordination, so the &quot;stumbling&quot; bit is probably justified.<p>Ketamine is exceptionally safe and relatively non-addictive BTW, though in my experience not all that enjoyable. GP needs to save the horror stories and fear mongering for MDPV, NBOMEes, etc. which arose as alternatives to much safer but highly contraband substances like LSD, MDMA, etc. with difficult-to-source precursors.",1392116542

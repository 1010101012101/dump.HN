Also, until the approach is proven to work in court there is a significant risk for a company to organize based on the proposed shell technology licensing company structure.<p>Trolls exploit a number of asymmetries in the system. First, at scale, a patent demand letter is cheap while the cost of the response to the letter is high. Second, cost of patent litigation is several orders higher than cost of patent licensing. Third, the return from winning a patent litigation case is effectively negative for defendants (because trolls are usually shell companies without funds to pay defendant&#x27;s court expenses) while trolls, on average, receive a positive return from patent litigation cases because they can target a large pool of companies.<p>To put small and medium sized companies on an even ground with trolls we need to bring together targets of trolls to organize and defend themselves.

Or have considered it before and concluded it&#x27;s not worth reexamining, hence it wouldn&#x27;t occur to me to reconsider it for my comment? The third option is the case here. I didn&#x27;t think about it again for my comment and then decide to <i>ignore</i> it. A better verb would be &quot;omit&quot;.<p>But let&#x27;s briefly reexamine it again... What does happen to bitcoin if no one spends it? Well it probably goes to a value of $0. Is this a hard inference? That makes your comment kind of reduce to &quot;you ignored the problem of what happens if bitcoin dies.&quot; If it dies, your coins are worthless. Duh? In reality we see people are spending bitcoins so there is presently some sort of incentive to spend, so maybe the problem isn&#x27;t the lack of incentive to spend itself, but whatever causes that lack of incentive to spend in the first place, and that cause cannot be currently at work because currently there is incentive to spend. So the cause cannot merely be &quot;deflation&quot;, as that&#x27;s already happening. A future cause could be hyper-deflation, but then I&#x27;ll ask you what happens to the USD in hyper-inflation...<p>A more general thing to look at is the incentive to <i>use</i> bitcoin and ask whether bitcoin is <i>useful</i>. Bitcoin is more than just a currency, it&#x27;s also a set of tools for making transactions. If bitcoin isn&#x27;t useful, there&#x27;s no incentive to spend or hoard it. Presently I think bitcoin is useful; bitcoin has the pretty cool feature of being able to pseudonymously send an arbitrary amount of money from anywhere in the world to anywhere else in the world, instantly, without reliance on a single third party. And the stuff highlighted on <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts</a> and elsewhere for future applications that the core infrastructure is more or less ready to handle is very cool. And there are items or experiences one can acquire with bitcoin that are difficult to acquire with traditional currencies and financial systems. All of these features are subject to competition. The US government could make drugs and online gambling legal and vendors could make such items and experiences easy to acquire with USD, Visa et al. could stop charging their array of fees (at least with bitcoin the only fees are small not-percentage-based transaction fees and currency exchange fees that are typically less than credit card processing percentages), PayPal could get better, etc. The many ways in which bitcoin could die due to better competition make that threat much more interesting and plausible to consider and wonder whether bitcoin could keep up or would die immediately as the case would be for &quot;what if it dies because no one spends it anymore?&quot;.<p>Edit: Admittedly a more interesting question can be &quot;what&#x27;s likely for the future of bitcoin when considering the ratio between people who find bitcoin useful for its features vs. people who just find it useful as a way to get more USD?&quot; If this was what you really meant to highlight, I&#x27;m sorry for misinterpreting.",1383554443

The Bitcoin network would be _much_ worse off (verging on useless) if the global hashrate was throttled. The purpose of mining is not, as you said, to distribute Bitcoins. The purpose is to make it extremely difficult to append a forged block to the blockchain. The higher the hashrate, the more difficult forgery is. The reason that so-called miners receive Bitcoins is because the hashing takes resources (e.g. machines and electricity), so there needs to be some incentive to perform this service.

It punishes those with debt, which will make it difficult for normal people to ever acquire large capital goods e.g. a house (by the way your argument that lenders won&#x27;t mind negative interest rates because their final value is worth more than what they started with is wrong because it doesn&#x27;t take into account opportunity cost - lenders compare the returns not against the current value of their holdings, but against their other options e.g. putting the money in a hole).  It reduces the velocity of money and therefore economic output.  You say that at least it redirects it to the areas that are most important, which may be true, but nevertheless, it shrinks the pie from which we all partake, and reduces the rate of growth, a problem in a world with a growing population.  Bitcoin would also suffer from similar problems to gold in that in bad economic times, all the capital needed to recover would flee the regions suffering, making any recovery much more difficult.",1383554066

A fisherman without extensive financial resources is not the same as a person with extensive financial resources choosing to fish. Here&#x27;s some alternative endings, in a country without social and medical support in place, for you to consider:<p>1. The fisherman develops a serious illness and finds he can no longer support his family. His wife, who was barely getting by on a fisherman&#x27;s income as a housewife, finds herself working at a local bar, serving drunk, lecherous men every day and night. His son and daughter find themselves unable to afford an education and really don&#x27;t want daddy to die. With mounting medical bills, the son finds himself involved in crime to support his family and is eventually sent to prison for life for a crime he didn&#x27;t commit.  The daughter meets a wealthy man and everything is great until he starts hitting her.  But at least she can support her father, lying on his deathbed in hospital.  Daddy eventually dies but by that point she&#x27;s stuck with 2 kids married to a man she hates.<p>2. Oh but medical welfare would solve the problem in #2?  Setting aside that this is contrary to my stated scenario (a country without medical welfare), consider this scenario:  the fisherman loses his fingers and toes in a freak fishing accident.<p>3. Oh but somehow he managed to afford an insurance policy that paid out on disability?  Setting aside how unlikely this is to be for people barely making a living wage, consider this scenario instead:  the nearby waters are polluted by an American oil extraction firm, and the fisherman finds himself scrubbing toilets at McDonald&#x27;s to support his family.

For me, the statement &#x27;life outside of work is more meaningful than work&#x27; just doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>While I do treat &#x27;work time&#x27; slightly differently than &#x27;free time&#x27;, the difference is not so great for me. It&#x27;s mostly to keep some ritual and prevent weeks turning into long blurs.<p>In fact, I&#x27;ve never really treated &#x27;work&#x27; as something so discrete. In high school, as soon as I figured out the &#x27;tricks&#x27; to not getting kicked out of school and not failing classes, I spent most of my time doing what I wanted. I could skip many classes and engage in the few that interested me. And I had loads of time and energy left to learn stuff that I <i>wanted</i> to learn. Often I could make a deal with teachers to not go to class because when I <i>was</i> present, I was active and engaged, and I treated them like, well, just people, not bosses.<p>In university, there were less hoops to jump through, and there was more freedom, but once again I skipped classes I didn&#x27;t care for (while making sure that I&#x27;d still have a decent grade and participate in group work), and actively engaged in the fun classes. Despite my absence, my targeted interested usually meant that I was one of people that the professors &#x27;knew&#x27;, rather than just a a face in the crowd.<p>And now, as a freelancer, I do make a point to set aside blocks of time for work, but for the most part I primarily try to make sure that I enjoy whatever I&#x27;m doing. Every once in a while a project feels like a chore, but for the most part I can choose the projects or the parts of projects that I enjoy or that I learn from.<p>Most of the time &#x27;work&#x27; doesn&#x27;t feel different from &#x27;life outside work&#x27;. I love talking about my work and I&#x27;m baffled by my friends who make a point of actively avoiding the topic on a Friday pub night. I occasionally work in the weekend, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m &#x27;losing&#x27; any of my weekend because of this. I occasionally take on projects that pay shit but are fun or helpful, and &#x27;subsidise&#x27; this with bigger, often less fun projects.<p>Meanwhile throughout high school and college I saw classmates go to every class no matter the value, diligently do all the exercises &#x27;just because&#x27;, and complain about how it all sucked. Working as a contractor, I see colleagues drag themselves into work on Monday after a rough weekend of &#x27;outside work life&#x27;, and joke on a Wednesday about how it&#x27;s almost Friday. And complain about how much work sucks.<p>I do get that not everyone has the freedom to find work that they enjoy, but what I don&#x27;t get is that so many people <i>do</i> have that freedom, and quite a good safety net (especially here in Europe), but don&#x27;t exercise it.<p>The happiest people I&#x27;ve known were generally the ones that didn&#x27;t make a strict separation between work and &#x27;life&#x27;, but instead found work that didn&#x27;t feel like work most of the time. It took a lot of creativity, effort and uncertainty to get there, but the results were worth it.<p>EDIT: I do realize that OP acknowledges this, so perhaps this should not have been a reply. apologies.",1383552523

Can&#x27;t turn it off. So no, users are no longer in full control of what they see.<p>&quot;The 140 character limitation means information flows at a high velocity.&quot; Except now with auto-expanding pictures you only end up seeing like 2 tweets at a time on a phone screen. This change is a serious compromise to the core Twitter experience, giving images undue extra weight and making it harder to scan.<p>He even brags about having third-party clients! Yup, which they have deliberately forced into providing a second-rate experience[2], and sucked the oxygen out of that market completely by capping number of users.<p>What all these changes have in common is that they make Twitter more like Facebook. I understand the reasoning, of course: More events shoved in users&#x27; faces = more engagement. Auto-displayed pics = improved discoverability for new users. Killing third-party clients = can claim tweets look and work the same everywhere, as Costolo also mentions. But what does it all add up to?

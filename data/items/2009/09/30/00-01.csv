This may not be true for most undergraduate curricula, true, but are not most undergraduate courses already taught by graduate students, lecturers and adjunct faculty? At the graduate level, you really want people who are active participants in their fields-- and this is probably true for the arts as well as the sciences.<p>I guess what i am saying is this: if <i>all</i> research moves to national labs and private institutes you will discover graduate education migrating there as well.",1254269002

In the old days if you wanted to buy a decent camera you'd buy photography magazines and pore over the reviews, readers' letters etc. - and that's where the glossy full-color adverts from Canon, Nikon etc. would be (and still are, but the magazines have really shrunk). I don't think websites do nearly as well as the print magazines did even though they may be putting in just as much work and delivering just as much value to their readers.",1254268960

The body of law and precedent requires that it does, in this case.  Though I am not a lawyer, a quick google search found a key phrase in Judge Jackson's Conclusions of Law document:  ""once it is proved that the defendant possesses monopoly power in a relevant market, liability for monopolization depends on a showing that the defendant used anticompetitive methods to achieve or maintain its position.""<p><a href=""http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f218600/218633.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f218600/218633.htm</a><p>That last phrase ""to achieve or maintain its position"" may involve the consideration of motivations.  Otherwise, a defendant might say ""we weren't dumping our product; we were merely giving our customers more for less!""  The discovery of telling quotations such as the two above would give lie to such a defense, and this is why the ""cut off their air supply"" quotation was considered so carefully during the proceeding.    That document is very interesting to read.  It discusses motivations  in several places.<p>2) Why does it matter today, now that browsers are (for the most part, Opera and others excluded) free?<p>Well, I guess it's really the Consent Decree and the Rule of Law that makes it matter today.  If the terms of your divorce say that you're not allowed to see your ex-wife's children, it doesn't matter if 8 years have passed and you have since stopped drinking.  You must abide by the terms of the decree to avoid contempt of court.<p>I said ""8 years"" in the above example, because that decree became effective in 2001.  It's interesting to note that there was a prior decree in 1995, and Microsoft did actually have to go through a contempt of court proceeding for not being in compliance with its terms:<p><a href=""http://www.techlawjournal.com/courts/dojvmsft/Default.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techlawjournal.com/courts/dojvmsft/Default.htm</a>",1254268926

They got to take their time to find their strategy. Today, both iPhone & Android platforms have App Stores. Palm needs to compete with that up-front (for both developers & for users.)<p>... and ""brand new platform"", ""ironing out bugs"", ""great user experience"", yadayadayada.

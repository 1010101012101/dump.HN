While DO boxes aren&#x27;t bad, in terms of the &quot;bad neighbor effect&quot;, I think they very much are oversold. Also, the virtualization tech is a continuum between complete and proper isolation of resources and time slicing of the CPU cycles on the one end, and Linux container style resource sharing on the other. Basically, the more isolated your VM is, the slower it will run. I don&#x27;t believe DO is using any type of really strong isolation. Because of this, if you start mining BTC on your droplet, you will suck the CPU cycles from all the neighbors.",1405436300

I&#x27;m probably what you&#x27;d call a tmux noob, but after a few months of using it on its own with minimal key remappings, I feel like my efficiency with the keyboard-only UI has already surpassed any gains I might get from sticking tmux integration with mouse support and tmux shortcuts. It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m opposed to this integration, but that I don&#x27;t think it goes deep enough.<p>Ideally, I think tmux would be inseparably integrated with the terminal emulator, with no shims to add complexity to the UI. For instance, it irks me that the workflow for integrating iTerm with tmux is running `tmux -CC` and then leaving that window open in the background for as long as it runs. I&#x27;m bothered by the fact that I have to run a command to begin the integration in the first place.

Hmm I donno.<p>250 boards is a lot of work.  I don&#x27;t think &quot;most&quot; hobbyists are into the hobby that long.  For the sake of argument, we&#x27;ll assume I&#x27;ve ordered that many PCBs as a hobbyist since 1980.  How many computers from 1980 are still supported with software updates etc?  I could eventually make 250 PCBs in a couple decades, but whats the realistic &quot;clock time&quot; lifespan of this thing?<p>Note that if you&#x27;re going into serious production rather than the prototype market, you can get a hundred small boards much cheaper than $17 a piece.<p>Another interesting thing to think about is this is a printer... you need a substrate.  First thing I thought of it using polished flat marble tiles from home depot.  So there are other costs.<p>Also its an ink emitter.  Much like ink jet printers which could theoretically print at 5 cents per page IF you use the ink up within 3 months of opening, reality is you try to print a report, realize your cartridge is dead / dried out, install a new $50 cartridge, print your report, and repeat six months later.  So ink jets actually cost like $10 per page as a real world on the ground cost.<p>Given the above, its quite possible you could pay $50 for a cartridge and a board every six months in a couple hours, plus $3500 capital cost, or pay maybe $40 for a pro shop to overnight airmail a prototype PCB to you every six months.<p>The TLDR is the financials only work over an extremely narrow range of production rates under very peculiar requirements.<p>Its interesting in the marketplace there are no serious efforts at a full kit for traditional hands on mfgr.  There are numerous partial kits that don&#x27;t quite contain everything.<p>You need a B/W laser printer that is stably calibrated to precise dimensions thats really good at transparencies, a box of transparencies, whatever gear you use to verify calibration (A machinists $5 class 1-2-3 block and some software?).  A UV box (basically a giant eprom eraser).  Some photo trays and etchants and other chemicals.<p>Some &quot;maker&quot; cultural groups have an intense aversion to hands on, however weird that sounds, and will pay anything or put up with anything, to avoid using their hands, and that&#x27;s probably the ideal customer for this product given that you can get better results cheaper and faster if you use a traditional PCB process.<p>There is probably a market for someone to sell a complete, vetted, verified photosensitive PCB etching kit.",1405435812

Current resources would be exhausted in a decade, but resources are defined as the known deposits extractable under current market prices. Should we actually start using a lot of uranium, the price would spike, which would lead to a lot more deposits becoming economically available. This has almost no effect on the cost of nuclear power, as the cost of the raw uranium isn&#x27;t a large part of the cost of producing power.<p>The end game there is when the price rises sufficiently for extraction from seawater becoming profitable.

It also includes encryption and authentication for use over the open Internet, something VXLAN does not.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VXLAN"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VXLAN</a><p>The intent is to -- for users -- make creating and joining virtual LANs as easy as doing a Skype conference call or a Google hangout. I think it&#x27;s almost there, but needs a bit of work from a UI perspective.<p>Beyond that there&#x27;s the enterprise and the potential of going into the SDN market, but I&#x27;m focusing on consumer and small business for now since it&#x27;s the shortest path to revenue.<p>I&#x27;m bootstrapping for now but exploring some possible partners / co-founders, a possible KickStarter/IndieGoGo for a hardware dongle later this year, and a bit after that seeking angel/seed type funding if things look good enough to merit that step. So far I&#x27;m picking up users at an accelerating rate, which is a good sign.<p>Everything except the web admin panel UI is open source.

8036655,comment,8034304,8035676,3,0,shock-value,,,"Facial recognition is exactly the kind of &quot;simple pattern matching&quot; that I&#x27;m talking about. It&#x27;s definitely useful, and definitely fits the label &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; (at least compared to other solved tasks), but it simply is just one minuscule piece of what actually constitutes human intelligence. Bear in mind that the original post referenced the &quot;singularity&quot; -- when artificial intelligence is smarter and more capable than actual human intelligence.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying that new AI paradigms are needed to improve that facial recognition score from 97.25% to 99+% (the existing techniques might actually be optimal anyway). I&#x27;m saying they are needed to even be able to attempt other tasks that actual humans find effortless, such as interpreting literature, creating a song, carrying on a conversation, decorating a room in an appealing way, understanding symbolic math, having this debate with you, etc. (Certainly symbolic math software has been developed, but no artificial intelligence has been developed that &quot;understands&quot; it and can put it into larger context, particularly one based on neural networks a la the real human brain.)<p>I don&#x27;t think my thinking is outdated (or even that controversial). It&#x27;s mostly informed by a Deep Learning class I recently took taught by Yann LeCun, who is definitely at the forefront of the field (although these opinions are entirely my own).<p>EDIT: Also, when I mention new &quot;AI paradigms&quot;, I do expect them to build on the deep neural networks currently being studied. But more sophisticated architectures than feedforward nets or even the simple recurrent nets that I&#x27;ve seen so far will be needed, I think. And that will likely require some breakthroughs in theory as well as engineering.",1405435149

I get to work on way more fascinating things in industry than I ever would have in academia.  I also get to work on lots of <i>different</i> interesting things, rather than focusing entirely in one narrow field.  Generally, my advice to PhD students considering working in industry is “if you’ve identified one specific problem that you want to devote years to, then academia may be for you.  If you want to have a constant flow of challenging problems and don’t particularly care about sticking to one narrow field, industry may be a better fit for you.”<p>My experience is that the incentives in industry are aligned so that it’s nearly impossible to succeed without having broad interests that allow you to have impact on multiple projects.  Incentives in academia are aligned so that it’s nearly impossible to succeed without being able to focus almost single-mindedly on one specific area and churn out the publications; there isn’t much time for exploration until you get tenure, at least.<p>Maybe I’ve just been lucky, though?",1405434232

You get your money back and they get punished by their card company for the fraudulent charge.<p>If more people did this, instead of waiting on hold for hours to fight with customer service for your own money back, the ISP would likely lose their merchant account for their fraudulent activity.<p>Edit: one other note when cancelling, make sure to take down the date, time and operator name & number during your interactions and note what was said.

So if I want to run for mayor and you really like me a lot better than the other person you can pitch in in different ways.

This by itself really isn&#x27;t a problem especially when there are caps on how much money people can donate, which there are. But if you donate as much money to my campaign as you are allowed what&#x27;s to stop you from calling up the local TV station and paying them directly to run an ad for me? I might not even necessarily be involved at any point.<p>The big problems come when we do things like decide a multinational corporation qualifies as a person and therefor the rules around how much money a company can donate don&#x27;t apply to them.

And then people do things like fund PACs where they pool their resources and promote a candidate on their own without actually donating to the campaign itself directly.

It needs to be transmuted by neutrons into uranium 233 (which is fissile).  By this measure, thorium isn&#x27;t any better than Uranium 238 - which is 99.3% of naturally occurring uranium.  So &quot;All but a trace of the world&#x27;s thorium exists as the useful isotope&quot; - can be applied to uranium also.  Uranium 238 is also a fertile isotope - and doing a completely fair comparison, uranium doesn&#x27;t need to be enriched either... Except the only way we have to convert fertile isotopes to fissile isotopes is to expose them to a sustained, high neutron flux which is typically only economically achievable using enriched uranium (via the naturally occuring U235 isotope).  Thorium breeder reactors need enriched uranium as much as uranium breeder reactors. So while thorium has some advantages, I wouldn&#x27;t say that natural abundance or supply are particularly significant.<p>[Edit] corrected use of &quot;fissile&quot; -> &quot;fertile&quot;",1405432862

If it has another use, then obviously we dont have to stick it in a hole somewhere.<p>Again, totally non-researched, off the top of my head assumption.",1405432857

It would be at a huge disadvantage vs. the F-35 and F-22 in the range and sophistication of its radar and targeting. A ridiculous amount of the expense and software code is dedicated to radar, targeting, and communications on modern planes.",1405432845

This is why you can&#x27;t eat just about any seed in quantity without processing it; they don&#x27;t want to be eaten and conduct chemical warfare to prevent it.<p>Even once processed you are still getting a huge amount of toxins, just not enough to be sick enough to notice.  I don&#x27;t know why anyone eats beans, ignorance I guess.<p>Beans are also loaded with carbohydrates, peeled potatoes are a much safer source of starch if you just want to load up on starch.",1405432842

Spend a few minutes typing a letter, pay the small extra fee for proof of delivery, and you are done. Your post office probably has an automated self-serve kiosk where you can do this in under 5 minutes. Time is money, don&#x27;t allow a company to spend your time like this.<p>Sure, you should be able to cancel on the phone with no hassle but that is a pipe dream. This is one instance where the old-school method still works best. I&#x27;ve done this with Verizon & Sprint when I lived in the States and was even able to cancel without penalty (they raised SMS a few cents each time) and not deal with their retentions people.<p>Now it is my preferred method for anything that takes over 10 minutes on the phone. Even if they are on the line, 10 minutes is a hard cutoff and I hang up, type a short letter, and mail it. It&#x27;s low-tech but very effective.<p>And for anyone else with Comcast, here&#x27;s the fine print that Ryan should have read to save all this aggravation.

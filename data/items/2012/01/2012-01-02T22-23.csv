I then have the options of (A) figuring out if there is a pref in that App to cause it to stop using battery when backgrounded, (B) Contact the application writer and let them know they have a poorly behaving App, and (C) (most important for me) - Reduce the number of applications I need to shut down to just the misbehaving ones.<p>Until then - count me in that category of users who believes (through experience) that the advice the Apple Geniuses are giving, that is, to terminate applications when you have an iPhone that is performing differently than when it is initially booted up, is good advice and is a real-world fix to this class of problem.

3417716,comment,3417618,3417618,0,0,MrFoof,,,"I think comparing the Raspberry Pi to the original OLPC concepts is rather misguided.  The OLPC is a computer that can be used immediately.  It's turnkey.  It has a display, and input devices, and comes in a case.<p>The Raspberry Pi reminds me more of the Heathkits my father used to buy, but we're talking more of the radio kits as opposed to the 25"" television sets.  It's a computer, yes, but it's not the entire puzzle -- it's just a piece.  If you build a radio, you want more than just sound -- you want something to easily change the frequency, more usable controls, a case, and a power supply that's a bit more manageable.  The OLPC gives you all of that as part of the kit (and in the case of the OLPC, preassembled), whereas with the Raspberry Pi you've got to piece together the rest of the system.  There's nothing wrong with that, but it does limit its accessibility if you're trying to get kids to program.  Sure, there's something to be learned buy gathering up all the components, but it's limited, as it's not much more than plugging in some cables with standardized connectors.<p>The Pi may have more horsepower, but it's basically just an engine.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great idea, but there's quite a bit more involved so someone can really explore what the hardware is capable of when compared to the OLPC.",1325544262

All I know, (And I'm speaking here as an owner of the Original iPhone, 3G, 3GS, 4, 4S who uses his iPhone multiple times, every waking hour) is that sometimes the iPhone gets hot, and the battery starts moving to 0 from a full charge in a matter of hours - when it does this, if I either (A) Reboot the iPhone or (B) shut down all of the apps listed in the ""Recently used"" task bar, then my iPhone is (1) No longer hot, and (2) experiences normal battery drain.<p>I reference the Android/ICS model because at least in _that_ world (and remember - I'm a dedicated apple users) I could tell you which of the Apps was actually sucking my battery dry.<p>If this were science, then it would be useful to collect a large number of observations that conflicted with accepted theory, to determine if (A) there was measurement error on the part of the observer - for example, perhaps I didn't wait 10 minutes after hitting the home button before waiting for the iPhone to cool down, or (B) There is a problem with the theory.<p>My belief is that it's (C) The theory is accurate, it just doesn't recognize that Apps will sometimes run in the background using more CPU than the user is aware they are, or wants them to.

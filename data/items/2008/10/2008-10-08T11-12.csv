More importantly, to have a good acquisition funnel to convert them to registered/regular users.<p>I'm not so sure all traffic is created equal, but the marginal benefit of all traffic is certainly positive.",1223465803

Too hands-on, maybe, but turning down money b/c some investor trusts the people he invests in just doesn't make any sense.<p>As for your query, of course there are huge, huge legal worries here. As a friend once told me, ""The IRS is a kitten compared to the SEC. Don't #### with the SEC."" Not to mention that no future investor will want anything to do with said company.",1223465077

326475,story,,,5,5,DanielBMarkham,"Ask HN: Door-to-Door Selling Stock to Fund your Company?",,"I was talking to my cousin last night, and he's formed up a partnership to get into green energy (I won't bore you with details) He said they had a large funder which they rejected because the guy was just too hands-off.<p>He mentioned something in passing, though, which bugged me. He said that he had found another funder who was willing to pay x dollars just for the opportunity to sell stock in his company in the local area.<p>This set off an alarm. Isn't it illegal to sell/trade a non-traded stock? If not, where do you draw the line? I remember reading about various ponzi schemes and such and the reason why the SEC was formed. Is it still possible to just go door-to-door and fund your company? If so, what are the worries in doing that?",1223464541

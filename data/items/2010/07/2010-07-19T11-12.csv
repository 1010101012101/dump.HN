  manufacturers voluntarily submit for (and pay for) testing.
</code></pre>
Why do these manufacturers do that? Perhaps just as a lawsuit hedge: they can always claim to have been 'certified by the <i>de facto</i> testing standard', in which case it's the reasonable expectations laid down by the law that drive the interest in this 'independent' testing. I.e.: the government.<p>Another explanation is that large brand A initially wanted to distinguish itself as 'the safest' and brand B just followed the lead so it didn't seem less safe. When they control a substantial part of the market, others will soon follow. After that, the actual contents behind the logo don't matter anymore. It's a perception-driven protection racket, the actual value of which cannot be determined by consumers. But it doesn't even matter how it comes about: after most of a market sports a certain logo or association, what's to stop that organisation from growing lax and pleasing their clients? There is hardly any room for competition in that market: who's going to start a UL competitor and why on earth would a brand be interested?<p>Or, the more fundamental question: who tests the testers? How do you know the UL is not theoretical and actually working? Even the government suffers from corruption; I doubt such companies are any better.",1279540749

Well in any case here's a fun idea I'd like to see implemented:<p>A music-making marketplace. What do I mean? Somewhere online that lets people sell simple musical components (like melodies, beats, lyrics, chord progressions /backing tracks) and musical services (like singing parts, mixing, playing, sequencing, arranging). Whole songs could be assembled in this entrepreneurial fashion.<p>How would the transactions work? Let people set there own terms (maybe support auctions), but one idea I had was everyone involved in the final track gets a cut of the songwriter royalties. If it's a hit, everyone could get rich! And sell the finished products on the front page, obviously (unless people opt to take it offsite).<p>If nothing else, it'd be something a bit different. Songs are often made like this anyway... Like the latest Eminem song was a beat from Alex Da Kid, probably using samples of something else, which Eminem put verses to, then a hook from an unknown singer was added, which was then rerecorded by Rihanna, etc",1279540389

Good example, but I thought the idea with OpenStack is to allow anyone to take this and run with it, customize it as they like and eventually end up with their own platform, potentially distinct from Rackspace's. In your example, Amazon says ""in order to use the payment system, you have to live on the Amazon cloud"" but I don't see any parallel restrictions in OpenStack, simply because it's open source and can be tailored unpredictably.<p>It's for this same reason that I question whether the benefits to Rackspace that you pointed out above really are such a sure thing for them.

It is far easier to strike a deal with a commercial entity, and I think that Conservatives are very aware of this fact.  I think it's a case of 'you scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours'.<p>""Not exactly. The Conservatives have a minority in the House of Commons in a coalition with the Liberal Democrats.

    example to illustrate what it would mean for a

</code></pre>
Definitely!<p>Let's start with an example of vertical integration: Apple has a strategy that involves heavy vertical integration. They sell the hardware and the software and the services. If you want OSX, you have to buy the hardware. More so in the phone space: if you want IOS, you need to buy an iphone. Once you've bought an iphone, you have to buy apps for it through the appstore. Even if you hate one part of the Apple solution, you may be forced to take the good with the bad. Even if you only want one thing, you generally have to get everything. If you want to run something that's not in the app store, too bad.<p>A scenario where this could happen with cloud services: imagine Amazon came up with a really good payment services platform, and then said that in order to use it, you had to live in their cloud. The market would have to interact with their cloud to get access to the payment services. Rackspace would lose access to the segment of the target market that needed this functionality.<p>By building a capability on the software side of cloud services, Rackspace will have better options in a situation like the one above:<p>* They will have a platform that they can build a competing payment services platform.<p>* It's possible that other groups who want the same outcome will contribute to their platform, strengthening it in lots of small ways to compete against other offerings.<p>* There may be other developers out there who are skilling up for their own ends, that Rackspace can hire at short notice if it needs to skill up quickly.<p>* They can start building a library of prior art and patents to use in defence against sniping from one proprietary operators in the cloud space.<p>In the mid-90s, IBM found themselves in an odd situation. They were offering a desktop and corporate operating system platform, but weren't very good at it because it wasn't their focus. Microsoft were good at OS strategy. So IBM found itself in a situation where it needed to invest heavily in Windows NT to avoid losing ground, and this meant that another company was setting its direction to a large extent.<p>Since then, IBM has got behind linux in a big way. There's far less risk of agenda-setting coming at them from the linux community. It's a stronger proposition for them to offer their customers, because potential customers don't have to fear IBM trying to lock them in to IBM products because in the way that customers might have been wary about this with AIX or OS/2 (or mainframes).<p>Imagine if Apple move into cloud services, and then get a patent on something ridiculous, and then use that to hound opponents. That's what they're doing in the phone space.<p>I think the guys at Rackspace have their heads screwed on. I'm looking forward to seeing a free and open cloud platform emerge.",1279538952

I seem to remember the baseband chip (which is also an ARM core, at least with the original iPhone -- never dealt with the others) being big endian, in fact.<p>Sadly, you can't do this on a per-process level, IIRC, like you can with PowerPC (a huuuuge perk for emulators).",1279538590

Also, apparently, the quality of power is pretty poor; lost of surges and unclean waveforms. Finally, the grid is unsuited going forward for more local and regional power generation (microgrids), because it was built for giant bulk power providers to transmit power over long distances, which made sense fifty years ago, but not as much today.<p>All of this is from Perfect Power.

In ARM, you can do a shift on the result of most instructions.  E.g. you can do <i>add r0, r1, r2, LSL #4</i>, which is equivalent to <i>r0 = (r1 + r2) << 4</i>.

Just a throw away war barb involving your feelings and that's it. I kept trying to bring it back to NASA pointing out how pointless this line of reasoning was. Next week it will be oil cleanup in the Gulf -- how can we spend $2 Billion on a bomber and not have solar power perfected? The week after it will be otters, or seals, or whatever. Whatever you want money to be spent on, it will be compared to Afghanistan and the waste going on there. It's a pattern of argument. Recognize the pattern.<p>There's no positive commitment to NASA -- it's all negative feelings towards defense spending. And negative feelings take people to the polls, not positive ones. This means it is in politicians best interests for you to continue feel angry about something, not happy about something -- as long as you're mad at somebody besides them. So you'll continue ranting against the war, and continue voting, and politicians will continue to get elected, and NASA will continue not to be funded.<p>Looking at it this way, it's in politicians best interests <i>not</i> to fund NASA, as they can always make the argument that war spending took the money NASA could have had. This lets them off the hook from making tough choices, keeps you mad both about NASA and DoD, and life goes on. All is good. After all, who are you going to vote out of office because NASA is <i>not</i> funded? NASA and all those four thousand other pet projects are just all so much background noise.

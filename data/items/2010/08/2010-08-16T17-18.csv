1608557,comment,1608369,1608369,0,0,jeromec,,,"Are you asking what are your chances of being successful with your startup as a solo entrepreneur, or what are your chances of being accepted into Y Combinator? If the former, I'd say you have about the same chances as you do partnering with other founders, which is not very good. Building a successful startup is hard whether or not you partner with others, and success depends much more on the founder(s) in question, more so than anything else. If you are asking the latter, Paul Graham specifically says chances are lower for getting accepted into YC for solo founders, because building a startup is too much work for one person. (I agree with that for the most part, but would qualify it by saying it depends on what exactly you're building, and even that is not always significant as, again, it depends more on the person) Interestingly, the example given as a successful application to YC was by the founder of Dropbox, who was a solo founder. I believe it is explained why this application was successful. I would suggest you read the ""Applying Successfully"" section. (more importantly, so does Paul Graham)<p>I don't know what you mean by adding a co-founder will add to your expenses. A co-founder should be working for equity in a project which may pay off later, the same as you are. If you're referring to the money successful applicants receive from YC that is not very much, only around 20K, and is meant to cover not much other than living expenses in San Francisco while building up a prototype enough to solicit more substantial funding later, after being introduced on Demo Day. I later realized this low funding amount was probably intentional, as it forces founders to be laser focus on finding/doing what it takes to make their product successful, as a money safety net is not there. The nice thing about that particular benefit is realizing that startups that don't make it into YC can be pressed in the same way.",1281981425

We've got decent stuff for web apps, but nothing for html building.  Cappucino and Sproutcore are starting to provide interface builder apps for javascript based apps. But still nothing that works.<p>I think an Interface Builder for the web would be revolutionary and profitable.<p>I'm tempted to say that if you don't have a bunch of ideas then you shouldn't be leading this thing-- but on the other hand, you have the presence of mind to recognize that those three ideas are all poor and that, my friend, is extremely valuable.  So at this stage, pick the best idea from here or from the other people who will work on it and go for it.<p>For anything you do-- see if you can find 4-5 people who are not engineers who will honestly say ""Yeah, if you could build that, I'd buy it for $X"" or that their company would.",1281980566

When I was in college, my grandfather cosigned for my line of credit, so when I was making enough money to allow it, I converted it into a standard loan to get his name off my debt. Not long after that - a few months, maybe - the bank called and said that I was <i>such</i> a good customer that they'd <i>love</i> to give me a brand new line of credit (with a $5k limit increase over the old one), and that they could consolidate my visa and loan debt onto the line of credit, which sounded like a great deal. So I did it, but I guess I missed out on the psychological reward you mentioned.<p>My student loans (the 'OSAP' in my top post - Ontario Student Assistance Program) were just this thing I never paid attention to. They just draw $96 from me every month, and I don't care that they do. When I have the money to pay it off entirely, I will, but for now just getting them to accept > $96/mo is such a massive hassle that I don't bother.<p>When my line of credit was paid off, the only ""reward"" I got from that was, ""that's it?"" I knew I still had that damn student loan, but there was little I could do about it for the reasons listed above. So I guess I just started living my life.<p>Oh, and ""paying off the highest interest first"" and ""paying off the smallest debt first"" were the exact same thing for me, since my smallest debt was the credit card.",1281980460

I've nursed its 11 sites mostly back to health from disrepair, while implementing what I believe to be sustainable, scalable structures for organic growth.<p>Over the last few months of re-bootstrapping, I've confirmed my most important hypotheses, hit breakeven, and am ready to look at raising money to scale more quickly.<p>The million dollar question: is an altruistic content play (i.e. the bastard child of ProPublica and teh Cheezburger network) better served, both for short-term purposes of fundraising and for the long-term, by the for-profit or non-profit world?<p>I wouldn't ask here if I thought there was one clear right answer, but I've always been rabidly pro-entrepreneurship since I saw firsthand the ineffectiveness and utter lack of financial independence of environmental nonprofits in DC.<p>There are many, many angles to consider and I would love to take the conversation offsite to any other venue if it's more useful, but I couldn't think of a better place to get the conversation started than HN.

The problem is if you attach qualitative judgment to it (the changing mind is good / bad, etc.) -- because it's very difficult to judge those things without knowing the future. For instance, take this note from the post:<p><i>UPDATE. A reader reminded me that Socrates was worried about the impact of written arguments many centuries ago. People have been wailing about technology spoiling everything for a long time.</i><p>Arguably, this 'linear' way of thinking that he argues pre-Internet writing cultivated -- arguably, that has real limitations. If you've ever studied ancient Greek, you might've noticed how anti-linear the language is (because of variable word order, cases, tenses, particles, etc.). In many ways Greek was a much more powerful way of thinking. And in many ways it works better in an oral environment. There is perhaps a reason that the Iliad and the Odyssey were created as oral poetry. As with a lot of archaic lyric and choral poetry that later formed the basis for Greek drama. And similarly, Socratic argument is something like the antithesis of a 'linear' mind (or certainly it complicates it).<p>So one might argue that linearity was a major problem that prevented, in certain areas, more dynamic, Renaissance-like thought until other languages developed a sufficiently rich and malleable base. Elizabethan English is anything but linear. Shakespeare, the spark and/or a central figure of that, was not linear in the written sense. 'Would that he had blotted a thousand lines...' was the general consensus until people paid better attention to his antilinearity, arguably.<p>But I mention all of this because it's important to study how different languages and mediums affect how we think. It's unlikely that anyone will figure out the present way of thinking, definitively, during the present. But I admire Nicholas Carr for trying (if I don't admire his judgments).<p>Perhaps he gets it completely wrong. Perhaps the internet allows us to have a non-linear renaissance of discourse, etc. But being precisely wrong is often half the battle, at least among analytical understandings of how mediums work, etc.<p>Or take Hacker News. The fact that you can't edit something that you post after a certain amount of time in conjunction with comments being attached a numerical 'value' from up/downmodding -- could dramatically affect what types of things are discussed here. I can understand the rationale (what's said is said -- editing after the fact is potentially disingenuous). However, people in turn may be less willing to take argumentative risks because they fear being locked into a 'trial' of an idea. Maybe this is good (for signal/noise). Maybe this is bad (low discursive risks, low discursive rewards). And I'm sure there are many other factors. But arguably it's worth thinking about all the effects of any type of medium.",1281979182

If you're an automobile mile-per-gallon (MPG) calculating app, frequent some hypermiling or green-car (or even general automotive) blogs and forums, get active, and then tell the site admin that you've got an app for that and that you'll promise them a promo code if they can review it. Be prepared for all kinds of tricks back from them (especially if the site is popular). If you want to make a deal (payola review, promotion, etc.), go ahead and make it. You don't generally have to do much with the smaller niche sites, though. A promo code will probably do it. You can also PM one of the board moderators or senior members if they want to take a look at the app as well. Could be worth it.<p>2) This doesn't really work with games (though it could, I guess), but if it's not a game app, SEO your product website, per instructions on patio11's blog:

1608361,comment,1606770,1606903,0,0,SoftwareMaven,,,"I think (as a technical guy now in the biz founder role) that this depends a lot on the context of the startup. Since we tend to focus on software startups here, and that is more what I know anyway, I'll talk to it. I think the concept apply to other fields, but the exact nature of the technologies would be different.<p>The biz cofounder needs to understand the technology as it applies to their business. Simple example: my startup relates to email. I have to understand SMTP, IMAP, and POP pretty well. I don't have to know how to build a mail agent.<p>You need to understand your particular technology backwards and forwards. When you are out talking to people, you are going to get asked technical questions.  You need to understand all the pieces of the system and how they work together.<p>In a big company, marketing, product management, and even sales engineering may get away with just using marketecture documents. You can't do that. You need to understand the full architecture.<p>A biz cofounder don't necessarily need to know how to code. Picking up a book and learning how to code won't help significantly. The value of a coding background for a biz person is understanding the development process, which kinds of things are easy to change (and which aren't), and (perhaps) acting as a sounding-board for the tech founder.<p>Since you aren't going to pick those up without a few years experience, just learning to code gives less value. Learning the meta information about coding (project management, agile development (and what that means to both developers and product owners)), mythical man-months, etc, are more valuable.<p>(All of this is, of course, my own opinion and worth every cent you paid for it, though I'm not sure it's worth every cent pg paid to host it...)",1281978308

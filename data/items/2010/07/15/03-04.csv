Yup, source diving is helpful!  Writing Java?  I have to single-step into the internals to get my programs to work right!<p>Understanding your libraries and their implementation is a <i>great</i> thing.  Once you realize that library code is not a magical black box, and is instead very much like the code you are writing, you can really become a productive programmer.  (""But what about abstraction!  If I have to understand my libaries, they're not abstract enough!""  Wrong.  Abstraction prevents parts of your program from knowing about each other.  You, the programmer, still have to know how each part works.  Abstraction means you only have to actively think about once piece at a time -- nothing more.)<p><i>The Posterous codebase is littered with monkey patches, modifying gems to work as we need them to.</i><p>Yeah, you know that ""fork me"" button on Github?  You click it, then you edit the code, then the bug is fixed for <i>every single person on Earth</i>.  That's the point of free software; if there's a bug, you squish it and move on.<p>(I do this all the time.  Does it take time to fork someone's project, fix the code a bit, and send them a pull request?  Yes.  But it's worth it, because now you have a robust and permanent fix... and a community!<p>Monkey patching is for monkeys.  Collaborating is what humans do.)",1279166220

1516839,comment,1516343,1516343,0,0,aaronblohowiak,,,"I think the attitude is different. Projects with a homepage outside of github I tend to treat as black boxes. Projects that are just up there with a README, I tend to take as someone saying ""here's this thing I built, use the source if you'd like."" The difference with the latter is that I do not expect support or a community. I consider the plugins and gems that are like that to be under my ownership, they are just saving me the time of writing the majority of the code. While I do have to fork and monkeypatch a lot, that is still faster than DIY. When effort to ""make right"" exceeds the effort to rewrite, I'll rewrite, simple as that. I think the ""just put it out there"" attitude is useful. We should also be better as a community when we give up on a project, though the metrics that gh provides give good ideas about the activity and life around something. If anything, reading through 10 implementations of slugs lets you know the pros and cons that you may not have considered before you go on and roll your own.<p>In short: in ruby community, libraries are starting points, not black boxes.",1279163821

I think pirating can be voting just the same except you&#x27;re hurting the creator or distributors ability to make or distribute more of it. I Don&#x27;t think that this is about whether something is worth paying for. It&#x27;s about whether it&#x27;s worth consuming. You wouldn&#x27;t go to a restaurant, order a dish, then only pay if you think the meal was worth paying for. The meal has already been made, the effort to cook it was expended, and if enough people get their meals for free the restaurant goes out of business. It didn&#x27;t go out of business because it made bad food necessarily, it only shuts down because their patrons were the type of people who thought it was okay to not pay based on their arbitrary standards of what&#x27;s worth paying for.

These protocols differ from Paxos by employing a different leader-election mechanism and slightly different way of maintaining their invariants.<p>There have been many Paxos variants.

If the task is something that you could do after having one beer, then it won&#x27;t present a problem if you do it while getting constantly interrupted.  Multitasking debilitates focused concentration at least as much as intoxication, which is why most people can&#x27;t text while driving etc.<p>If you find that the entirety of your to-do list is made up of things that couldn’t be done after a beer, then you are going to be unproductive in your work environment.  Focus on eliminating the interruption.  You may have to hack together a solution that people who don’t spend long periods deep in thought will understand.<p>For example, wearing earbuds even if no music is playing, randomly shutting your door, making an emergency script that opens MS Excel when someone walks in so it looks like you were working rather than wandering Wikipedia so your subconscious mind could solve a problem, writing a description of something you are working on at the same time every day on your office calendar so that people will subconsciously not bother you during that time, and speaking at half speed when people ask you a question so that they jump to conclusions about what you might be thinking and reprimand themselves for not being more prepared before they come to you.<p>Basically it comes down to the liberal use of improvisation of your work environment isn’t structured in a rational or logical way.  I faced the same problem at a tech support job I had that demanded 3-8 computer repairs a day but didn’t delegate phone or front desk support to employees on a rotating schedule.

When you are close to exhaustion, you won&#x27;t have the extra elevation or the extraneous movement or the inefficient motions - you&#x27;ll find the path of least effort.

I don&#x27;t see how this is relevant.<p><i>Why the are you storing logs in /var/log/messages, /var/log/syslog, and your own logs?!</i><p>Solved much more elegantly by the likes of daemontools and derivatives (s6, runit, etc.), many years before systemd.<p><i>Dependancies, systemd handles these nicely.</i><p>Hardly &quot;new&quot;. Dependency systems in init daemons and service managers have been rolled many times, from the primitive need(8) facility to the LSB initscript headers (which almost all SysV-based distros had adopted) to OpenRC, Solaris SMF and so forth.<p>systemd&#x27;s model is far more involved.

8807258,comment,8806835,8806835,0,0,ahelwer,,,"Software engineers love Paxos because it takes something very complex (a distributed system) and makes it equivalent to working with a single machine: you only ever talk to the leader. It gives you redundancy at the expense of performance.<p>Paxos is used to achieve something called Strong Consistency, where each node sees the same message in the same order. If you think of each node as a deterministic state machine, they are guaranteed to end up in the same state after responding to the same sequence of messages. It&#x27;s nice and intuitive, but requiring global synchronization on every write is terrible for performance.<p>Other consistency schemes exist. A popular one is Eventual Consistency, where writes are made immediately at any node (not just the leader) and the system is expected to synchronize in the background and &quot;converge&quot; to the same state. However, this can result in merge conflicts: if you&#x27;re editing a document in collaboration with other users, what if you edit a word in a paragraph while another user deletes that entire paragraph? Does the system resolve this automatically, or require user assistance? The answer to this question varies according to system requirements. I think most HN users have experienced the joys of resolving merge conflicts.<p>A newer model is something called Strong Eventual Consistency, which is similar to Eventual Consistency but merge conflicts are impossible by design: every update to the system must be commutative, associative, and idempotent with other updates. It is not always possible to design your system this way. These systems are implemented with Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (or ad-hoc equivalents) and have excellent liveness/throughput/performance characteristics compared to Strong Consistency.<p>CRDTs are not as simple as Paxos. You&#x27;re forced out of the cozy one-system world and your system must deal with two nodes concurrently holding different values. For most applications, magic Paxos dust is all you need. For others, CRDTs are an excellent tool.",1419796886

Gradually I&#x27;m sleeping better, eating better, reducing stress, and getting more exercise, all of which is important for the next thing:<p>2. Memorize as much as I can. It&#x27;s an exercise; I memorize phone numbers, schedules, people&#x27;s names, trivia, all kinds of stuff. I&#x27;ve never found anything that matches the flexibility and utility of my own brain. I should use the best tool I have, and that&#x27;s in my head. Technology is unreliable and constantly changing and difficult to organize and search. I&#x27;ve been practicing this for long enough that now I&#x27;m pretty good at it.<p>3. For everything else, I use a few simple systems: a few sheets of paper to the right side of my desk for scribbling and note-taking (meant to be discarded after a day or two), a pile of to-do to my left, a tab open in my text editor labeled &quot;notepad&quot; for longer-term stuff, and a well-organized directory of documents on my laptop with subfolders like &quot;projects&quot;, &quot;writing&quot;, &quot;sysadmin&quot;, etc. -- I try to keep this directory as small as possible by dedicating time here and there to either finishing or pruning projects.<p>I disagree that keeping knowledge in your head isn&#x27;t efficient. I think a lot of people just don&#x27;t practice it enough. Smartphones and computers and everything else make it really easy to not bother. But, my brain is always with me, doesn&#x27;t require batteries (well...), can store any type of information I want, and can instantly recall it without having to craft some kind of search query or organize the information in a rigorous way. It is exactly the kind of database storage we all wish we had. It never changes data formats, it never tries to get acquired by a bigger company and then shut down, and it gets reception everywhere I go. If my brain were an electronic tool, I would want to use it all the time. And, the more I use it, the better it works.<p>(edit: oh yeah, and pinboard. Looove pinboard.)",1419796818

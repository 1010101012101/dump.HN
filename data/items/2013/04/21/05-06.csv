It's ridiculous.<p>Even if Jobs's behavior towards subordinates is related to his success, it may not be in the way people think. Perhaps his abuse of engineers was valueless, and that the win for Apple was in him abusing management rivals so they were all afraid of playing the normal turf games. Or maybe his prickishness was only needed to get him back in charge of Apple as chief tastemaker, a CEO who was willing to spend on design until a product was fucking right.<p>If we expand the sample size to n=2 and just add another Jobs company, Pixar, we can see that it's possible to produce an extraordinary amount of great work without anybody running around being a giant asshole all the time.",1366522228

There's certainly diversity in ethnicity in that there are large population of whites, african-americans and hispanics.  Outside of those groups there's a large fall-off.  But more importantly a key weakness of Houston is its lack of cultural diversity.  I found to be the most parochial city of 4million people I'd ever experienced (and I've lived in a lot of places).  It is not really remotely comparable to something like Silicon Valley in that regard, sadly.<p>However, I share your hope that the increased ethnic diversity, and the general nationwide cultural trends of young people being more open to new things and will become thought leaders.  Of course my reluctant skepticism comes from what I experienced (great anecdote for another venue) of the control of thought leadership by a very narrow good-ole-boy network which appears pretty well entrenched and able to ride out the best intentions of upcoming potential leaders.

It used a method called visual occlusion, which you can guess the rest ofthe pilots would sit in trainers with a set of glasses, that had spring-loaded solenoid flaps to block the pilots' vision selectively. The open time as well as the frequency of the system was experimentally varied until the pilot could fly the plane safely, for given conditions. The vacuum tube circuit that I repaired had a date stamp from the mid seventies but this technique was already more than a decade old by then. The same technique is now used (with liquid crystal shutters) to evaluate interfaces in cars for drivers, maybe a variant would be useful for certain application areas of software (modulating the screen, perhaps)?",1366521117

The reason is, those balanced review, well written pages are the same ones that humans have curated and used in their own citations. People do a much better job of language understanding than some simple sentiment analysis and the other other things you do. Because humans do it better, when google comes along and leverages all that human curation, the results are staggeringly good. Sure, there are easy to find edge cases, just like there were with your engine when i tried it, but I don't see anything new here. Maybe you could provide some example queries that demonstrate it producing better results than google or bing?<p>If, you could do comparison queries like Nikon vs canon and it produced a summarized report, that would be interesting, but it didn't do that.<p>Song lyrics are easy!

267207,comment,267049,267195,0,0,benjamincanfly,,,"Thanks for the notes, I'll take some of these suggestions. The ""YouTube of conversations"" idea really resonates. Sometimes a simile does far more than a detailed explanation - Command Shift 3's ""like Hot or Not except (...) you click on hot websites"" is perfect, for example.",1217915520

267199,comment,267170,267170,0,0,sdpurtill,,,"Surprisingly, today's very rich say that money itself wasn't much of a motivator. Once you've got food in your belly and a big-screen TV, the mere prospect of more Benjamins isn't enough to get you leaping out of bed at 5 a.m. Rather, rich folks often make their fortunes after they make up their minds to solve a problem or do something better than it's been done before.<p>Very true for me and I'm sure a lot of the HN community. Once you get past a certain point with money it becomes an after thought, then you have the freedom to think of other things (like big ideas) that will make you more money. The rich get richer for a reason...",1217914701

267195,comment,267049,267049,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Great concept. I would start by putting everything into the dashboard page. Perhaps borrow from the look and feel of the Wikipedia main page, in terms of fitting everything into four different boxes. The theory page isn't necessary; I know it's only for HN readers, but once the site is good enough the concept will speak for itself (it already does for the most part.) Choose a snappier name. This has the potential to get really big. (The YouTube of conversations?)",1217914196

267184,comment,266218,266566,0,0,drewcrawford,,,"It's easy to write off HN outrage as mere classism; of course that completely sidesteps the question of who is right and who is wrong.  I'm certain that there are a significant number of people here who agree with the author, or some subset of the author's views, and that there are a majority who disagree.  To state that is to state that ""black people want affirmative action"" or ""republicans will vote for mccain.""  It's statistically true, in a vague and general sort of way, but doesn't really say anything about whether or not we should have affirmative action or whether or not mccain should win.<p>The real problem I have with the authors is that they operate from the <i>presupposition</i> that operating a business (which, on a transactional level is really just free exchange, like exchanging fish for books) is somehow <i>unfair</i>.  The authors are neither party in the exchange; they are providing neither the fish nor the books, and are merely standing from the sidelines, saying ""You should not exchange six books for twelve fish!""  which is of course none of their business.
The only other way I can see to do it would be to have some sort of a middleman who decided the amount of fish being traded for books, and he would probably take a cut off the top for his 'service'.  In gradeschool we called this 'bullying', but one man's moral outrage is another man's fairness I guess.",1217912951

He learned how to deal with the angriest people from one of the most self-critical industries in the world (IT).  I'm no therapist, but many of the comments on Slashdot, Reddit, or TechCrunch seem to come straight from a guide to the DSM IV.  If he learns how to deal with criticism like that, then he's set for life and I'd bet on his next venture succeeding.",1217912880

I am reminded of a historian who studied the Holocaust and was mortified to discover that when she went on TV to discuss her latest book, she was paired up with an opposing viewpoint Holocaust denier. The TV network was nice and ""neutral"", they made a very sincere attempt to keep ""bias"" out of their reporting...and the result was moral bankruptcy.<p>You seem to have switched from discussing neutrality to impartiality and to me those are very different concepts. I expect a judge to be impartial but not to be neutral: a neutral judge could never make a judgment. The whole point of analyzing evidence is to become non-neutral, to make a determination of the state of the world.",1295837807

The problem is that there is no sense in, having begun using them, declaring that you are now in charge of the truth or really have any particular access at all.<p>Statistical analysis doesn't prove things correct.  It allows us to prove things incorrect.  The assertion that whatever is left is true, is correct, typifies rationality.<p>But here's the thing, here's why it's called lesswrong, why the idea is to increment in favor of the truth: everyone's actually pretty rational.  Some people are more wrong than others, but given the assumptions they work with, they are making rational choices.<p>If you are declaring people irrational, the problem is with your definition of rationality, not with them.  In finding out _why_ they are rational you will find out _why_ they think differently than you.<p>Take atheism vs. theism.  The assumption of irrationality on either party shuts down debate and lets no information traverse between the viewpoints.<p>But if you realize that everyone's pretty much the same, the problem you raise just _goes away_.  Everyone's at a different place on the axis of rationality, no one is stupid, and there are people who are more right than you so there's not much point being annoyed with those who are less right.<p>So calling one's self a rationalist, to me, is either equivalent to saying ""I am a human being,"" because all humans are somewhat rational and believe in the assertion that true things can be known (whether they say so or not), or ""Other people are dumber than me and that is a part of my identity.""",1295836888

A very common occurence is for a mechanic to dismantle a car to find out what's wrong, then to quote the cost of repairs to be either more than the person can afford, or more than the car is worth.  At that point the customer sometimes refuses to pay even the amount of work done at that point.  At which point the car sits in the yard for the alloted period of time, at which point the mechanic takes ownership and sells off what is left (or, sometimes, fixes it themselves and sells for a profit).  Usually the mechanic also has the right to charge a storage fee, and to levy interest on the unpaid item to increase the size of the total lien.  And it's normal for the mechanic to lose out badly, which is why some people require up-front payment to undergo speculative work to find the source of a problem that could be expensive.  The same goes for electronic equipment-  it will cost you $200 to even open up a camera to see what is wrong, which is why most get thrown in the bin when they stop working.",1295835367

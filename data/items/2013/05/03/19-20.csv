5652172,comment,5651598,5652071,6,0,gfodor,,,"The author admits those bullet points can be fixed. The core argument against Glass is it is trying to upheave social norms well before society is ready for them. Are people ready to have conversations with each other where there is a distracting screen in the corner of their eye at all times? Are you going to be annoyed when it's clear someone is only giving you half their attention, but doing so less overtly than if they were staring at their phone? I put my phone away at dinner, will people be continually turning Glass on and off as they enter and exit conversations?<p>The fact is phones and tablets had analogues going back hundreds of years in the form of books and wristwatches in terms of social norms. You check your watch, you check your phone. You sit down and read a book, you sit down and read your iPad. Society accepts local distractions where the user overtly makes it clear they are looking at something. There is no equivalent to Glass where the user has a distracting bit of information floating right within their view, but invisible to other people. This is a <i>genuinely new</i> disruption of social norms and it's wide open how people will react to it, and if they will ever accept it.<p>I don't agree that ""it's all a matter of execution."" Putting a cyborg-like eyepiece on people and an always-available HUD in front of them is not a foregone conclusion as something most people will ever want in their lives.<p>I've always said it's going to come down to how stupid you look to other people. And yes, I realize cell phones, etc, were viewed as douchey when they first came out. But the key difference between cell phones (and this is important) is that you could put the cell phone in your pocket, nullifying the douche-factor until you took it out again. If you take off your Glass because you look like a tool, you just completely eliminated the purpose of Glass.<p>I think the most likely path for Glass is that of the Segway: an uncool device that has amazing practical applications for professionals in certain domains.

It is illegal to remove the serial number from a gun that has one, but it is not required that all guns have serial numbers.  Guns manufactured before serial numbers were required of licensed manufacturers obviously don't have them, but also, if you manufacture a gun for yourself, which is perfectly legal, you are not required to manufacture it with a serial number.<p>In short, you're absolutely right that the removal of a serial is a felony.  Also true for the sale, purchase or possession of a firearm that has had its serial number removed.  It is also true that all guns manufactured by firearms dealers for sale in the US after 1968 are required to be manufactured with a serial number.  But simply having a gun without a serial number is not necessarily a felony, depending on whether or not it ever had one or who manufactured it.",1367609609

If fewer people have guns, there will arguably be fewer gun crimes, but that depends entirely on which people still have them.<p>If 100% of law abiding citizens' guns were to evaporate tomorrow, that doesn't make us any safer, as it still leaves possession of guns in the wrong hands.<p>Ignoring that though, I'd feel remiss if I didn't point out that people can already legally produce weapons at their home and amass their own 'secret arsenals' with readily available technology (a drill press, $200 on Harbor Freight).  The ATF allows for the purchase of what's referred to as an 80% firearm, which means it's a block of metal in the shape of a gun that simply hasn't had its trigger group milled out.  A $200 drill press and a $100 jig allow me to currently manufacture a large number of firearms for personal use, so long as I don't manufacture them with the intent to sell.<p>This might make it somewhat easier, and future generations of it almost certainly will, but at least for the moment you can rest assured that the printed product is vastly inferior to the firearms I can already manufacture in my garage and are not more convenient to make.",1367608482

The high polar moment of inertia actually should make any spin slower to start and easier to catch than a mid engine arrangement.  Under hard braking the weight shifts forwards so the weight distribution changes to more balanced than with other arrangements.  Under power the weight is over the rear wheels for power out of the corner.<p>A 911 behaves differently to other cars but I'm not sure the arrangement is actually worse in most dynamic scenarios.  Understeer into the corners is the main dynamic weakness when pushed really hard and can be compensated for by trail braking into the corners.  I guess you can get into trouble if you go into a corner too fast, panic brake and lose the rear end but if you are used to the set up you can make use of it.<p>[I've only driven a 1980's 911 so maybe I'm over extrapolating to all rear engined cars and I've never tried a mid engined car.\nThis book is really good at explaining how do get the most out of different weight distributions and has some fun stories (I've got the first edition but it probably isn't much different): \n<a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Porsche-High-performance-Driving-Handbook-Elford/dp/0760327548"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Porsche-High-performance-Driving-Han...</a>]",1367608334

But that is important if you believe they are you client - ie the persons who'll make the purchase decision, but maybe it will be the kids themselves in this example?<p>Critic aside, it's a great idea for a generalist app, but it may be less than ideal for say a specialized app.<p>Also, you should consider the alternatives - how much feedback do you think the same $50 may have got you using the mechanical turk?<p>There is a sincerity risk, but if you get say 100x more feedback, with the law of large numbers, I think that at least the obvious flaws could be noticed.",1367607696

Changing the subject isn't difficult because the designers failed at making it easy, it's difficult because the designers succeeded at making it difficult.  They really, really don't want you to change the subject because consistent subject lines are essential to gmail's conversation threading functionality, so they've made it as difficult as possible.<p>similarly, the hiding of all the formatting options: they have all that space available, and they've quite deliberately chosen to hide things anyways.  there's no way they just did it to make the compose window prettier, they want you to stop using so much formatting in your emails.  Read the interview[1] with gmail's designer, they are trying to use a simpler UI to encourage faster and smaller responses and lower friction conversations.  By and large, people are using email as a messaging tool, not to sit down and spend half an hour composing a letter, and they are adapting gmail to cater to this behaviour.  you might disagree with their goals, but don't mistake your disagreement with their direction for a failure to advance their direction.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672250/how-a-tiny-new-compose-window-could-reinvent-gmail"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672250/how-a-tiny-new-compose-w...</a>",1367607694

5651939,comment,5650431,5651623,4,0,dmmalam,,,"Pretty much all systems marketed as 'active' aren't really 'fully active'. Remember from mechanics/Differential Eqns, a suspension system is basically a damped harmonic oscillator. The two main constants are the springing and damping. The majority of cars just have electronically variable dampers. ie the same oem parts from bilstein/dephi/bosch with some silly marketing acronym on like Porsche PASM, MagneRide etc.<p>Some have variable strength roll bars, but roll bars are really just a 'hack' anyway. Very few have used a variable springing system (Merc ABC). An air suspension can change springing and ride height, but's it's slow.<p>In addition to low latency damping/springing adjustments/ride height, a fully active system in able to apply force into the suspension so the attitude of each corner is under complete software control, milli by milli. You can have a perfectly smooth ride, but no roll. All current non-active designs are a compromise between sporty and confort (high vs low springing/damping constants, and movements in attitude due to accelerating/braking/downforce/cornering/road surface.<p>The main problem with fully active is that it uses quite a bit of power and is very complex.

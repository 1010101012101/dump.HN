I would also imagine that the PE licensing rate among practicing traffic engineers is pretty close to 100%, whereas I have yet to meet a PE-licensed software engineer...  I'm sure the half-dozen or so licensed engineers at NCDOT were probably pretty freaked out to see a study like this from an amateur.  Who knows, maybe the group did blow a lot of the conclusions -- it's almost certain that Cox's team disagree with the report, since it is counter to their recommendations.  Anyway, the last thing the state engineers want to do is to validate the standing of the community group by engaging with them on the issues, even if it's to educate them on where they made mistakes, so they're going to look to discredit them.<p>As an analogy, practicing medicine without a license is a crime, even if you're really good at it, and even if all of your patients know you're not licensed.<p>Again, I think this is a terrible way to try to solve the problem, even if it is supported by laws or regulations.  Professional fields of all kinds need to cope with the fact that organized groups of laypeople are going to be able to mount credible challenges to their opinions, on their turf and using their tools.",1296809994

Why, oh why, do I have to prefix -moz- or -webkit- onto CSS instructions in a ""standards compliant"" world?<p>Web dev is getting badly fractured again. There was a point of stability about two years ago where all of the IE quirks were knowns and the rest of the browsers followed CSS2/HTML4 fairly consistently. There was a blissful period where you knew something might be borked in IE6, but could almost just assume things would render in most other browsers.<p>Such a time has now ended.

2178827,comment,2178100,2178100,0,0,drdaeman,,,"Unmetered costs more. I don't know about Canada or US, but in Russia it's certain that your ISP pays for their uplink channels several times more than you would for the same bandwidth. Partially, that's because there are completely different SLAs, but that's also because a good share of users are consuming moderately (like web browsing) with only accidental high-traffic spikes. If every customer online will try to get their promised bandwidth at the same time - ISP will literally choke - and nobody would get even remotely satisfying connection. That's why ISPs have to impose bandwidth limits. Here, they're commonly shaping down the line after the traffic cap's hit.<p>In fact, I believe almost every ISP - unless they're monopoly - would be happy to drop the prices while keeping the satisfable service quality. Unfortunately, most of time they just can't (and when they can, they surely do).<p>Also, while it's certainly none of my business, I sometimes wonder why some individuals download <i>terabytes</i> of information per month. Considering the most heavy application I know of - downloading raw BD rips - they have to watch a movie every single evening. Must be quite a bad taste for a videophile, to say the least. For less traffic-heavy content, they just won't be able to consume it in time. I'm not saying that terabytes are not needed - sure there're cases where even petabytes might be necessary - but there're too many users who download whole day and night every month.

Towards the bottom of page 1, the article explains that ""[w]hen pressurized helium on the top side of the metal plate is heated, sound waves traveling through the gas are amplified, causing the plate to vibrate....""<p>When the pressurized He is <i>heated</i> it causes the sound to be <i>amplified</i>? But heating the He should cause the density to <i>decrease</i>, of course, and therefore <i>reduce</i> the power of the sound waves propagating through the He, no?<p>I'm not aware of any relationship between frequency and amplitude, just V=(freq)(wavelength). What's going on? The only thing I can think of is that perhaps there's some sort of resonance going on in the chamber? As the pressure drops, the speed of sound should drop. But this shouldn't necessarily affect the frequency... so I'm totally confused. Maybe there's a resonance effect as the waves propagate slower and slower and interfere with one another? I'm totally lost.

As we showed in our latest report, in the Apple App Store for iPhone in the United States, almost 50% of the revenue of the top grossing applications was generated by applications carrying in-app purchases. For developers this enables a range of opportunities to sell premium features and content but RIM also opposed several restriction limiting developers. The restrictions include selling virtual currencies or in-app credits, selling physical goods or services and selling digital goods used across multiple applications. For pricing, the same tiers as applicable to BlackBerry App World can be used.<p>According to RIM, the Payment Service provides a similar payment experience as going in BlackBerry App World. Consumers can, provided they have a BlackBerry ID, apply various payment methods, including credit card, PayPal® and carrier billing. The SDK seems to have been available since the 5th of January (BlackBerry’s developer site), but the first applications incorporating the new functionalities still have to hit BlackBerry App World. So far we did not see any notable changes in the storefront of BlackBerry App World, but we will keep you posted when the first applications do appear. We will also keep track of the take-off and are curious to see whether the success in the Apple App Store can be replicable by other stores.<p>by Gert Jan Spriensma.",1296807892

You can salt the hash (basically: pre-pend a unique string to the password) to defeat rainbow tables, but SHA doesn't do this by default.  You can SHA something more than once to slow things down, but SHA doesn't do this by default (and rainbow tables still work - they're <i>based</i> on repeated hashings).<p>BCrypt is slow by design (ie, thousands of times slower).  It's a much-harder calculation, and it automatically <i>uniquely</i> salts what it's hashing, and you can make it more secure incrementally by simply running it through more steps (it's designed to do this).  The speed isn't noticeable to a user while logging in because checking if their password is correct is still extremely quick, but attempted-brute-forcers run up against a brick wall as their attempts are now rainbow-table-proof and slower by orders of magnitude.  Best of all: it does all this <i>by default</i>, and it stores all the necessary information in the result so comparing values against it is fool-proof.  You can't mis-use it.<p>SCrypt takes all the advantages of BCrypt and goes a step further: it guarantees that a certain amount of memory (ie, large) is required to perform the hashing function.  So while SHA / BCrypt can still be attacked more quickly by, say, performing a thousand operations at a time through custom hardware, SCrypt can demand so much memory that it's simply infeasible to do so, so you're stuck testing one. password. at. a. time.  It's the ultimate death to brute-forcing, basically.",1296806573

Sadly, the industry currently does not offer enough stability to guarantee that I will be able to watch an online-bought movie download on my next computer five years in the future. Hence, I don't buy downloadable movies.<p>For renting however, I think this list is far too stringent. I don't care about copy protection, subtitles, languages etc if I rent a movie online. I will watch it only once, anyway. If the feature set is ok for that one time, it's fine.<p>As for prices, no need for fancy rules: If it's too expensive, don't buy it.<p>My very simple rule concerning piracy: If the movie is available for rent in the language I want, I will pay money to get it.

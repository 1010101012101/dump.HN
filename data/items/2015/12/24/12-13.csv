You&#x27;re still fundamentally trusting the hardware to read and obey the instructions on your weird &quot;external SPI&quot; device, and if you&#x27;re willing to trust the hardware then you might as well just put it on the motherboard like today&#x27;s devices do. If you don&#x27;t trust your hardware (and I challenge anybody to prove that a motherboard full of chips hasn&#x27;t had a chunk of flash memory added to it without your knowledge) then you have no reason to think that the code it loaded was the code stored on your &quot;trusted stick&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t believe that it is possible to build a secure system which isn&#x27;t based on trusting the device that you hold in your hands. At some level, you need to have a device which is capable of both UI and computation functions to a sufficient extent to validate whatever transaction you are attempting to sign. You could push that onto a smaller device than your laptop (we already know that phone-sized devices are viable), but you still have to end up at the thing you interact with for signing purposes being a device that you trust.",1450961531

10787983,comment,10787567,10787567,0,0,obrero,,,"Iran had a parliamentary democracy until 1953.  In 1953, the prime minister, Mosaddegh, began talking about nationalizing Iran&#x27;s oil.  The UK and the USA went by the normal playbook, bankrolling minorities, religious and otherwise to subvert the government (like the Hmong in Vietnam, Miskitos in Nicaragua etc.)  The CIA and SIS also backed the ayatollahs who wanted to overthrow the parliament and establish an Islamic republic - like Ayatollah Mohammad Behbahani, Mohammad Falsafi and even Abol-Ghasem Kashani at the end.<p>So western readers knowing this can know the history - the secular parliament of Iran was overthrown when the US and UK backed the ayatollahs and others in ousting it.  Then in the 1970s, the ayatollahs wanted an end to US influence in Iran, which is when Iran began becoming a pariah.  US nuclear companies were printing ads in newspapers boasting about how they were helping make Iran a nuclear power ( <a href=""http://img.myconfinedspace.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/shah-iran.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://img.myconfinedspace.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/sh...</a> ).  This is in the years before the GOP invited Netanyahu to Congress to scold Obama that he wasn&#x27;t bombing Iran for wanting to use nuclear power (also, it&#x27;s implicit that Israel is allowed to be a nuclear power, Iran isn&#x27;t).<p>It has little difference from other countries - if you notice, the US has been working to overthrow the last of the old Nasserite pan-Arab nationalist pseudo-socialist governments like in Iraq, Libya and more recently Syria.  In fact, the US has been arming jihadists fighting Assad&#x27;s secular government - something Putin himself has noted.  Meanwhile the US backs to the hilt Islamic dictatorships like Saudi Arabia, Brunei etc. which are lapdogs to the US.<p>This notion that the US government is against Islamic radicalism is absured.  It&#x27;s true enemies are always the Qadaffis, the Saddam Hussein&#x27;s, the Assads, the Mossadeghs.  The US supports Islamic fundamentalist jihadists - Osama bin Laden is a creation of the US, banking his and the mujahideen fight against a secular socialist Afghani government.  Sylvester Stallone made a Rambo movie where he went to Afghanistan and fought alongside the Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters, attacking the secular socialist Afghani government and Russians, the end of the movie credits are &quot;dedicated to the brave Mujaheddin fighters&quot;.  That movie came out in 1988, 13 years before 9/11.",1450961058

Moving all firmware to a device that lives on an external bus means that you must either create a &#x27;trustworthy&#x27; distribution channel for all supported firmware (including all system components and peripheral devices), or support only a select few devices and forbid adding any new peripherals. It also means peripheral devices must either be capable of bootstrapping themselves from this chip, or the system must provide a mechanism that &#x27;sends&#x27; this firmware to all peripherals before booting the system. I&#x27;m inclined to think that the complex interdependency of this boot process seems impractical.<p>Also, I have to disagree that FPGAs are ideal for the architecture proposed by this paper. Performance and state issues of an FPGA aside, they&#x27;re field programmable, which seems more vulnerable than &#x27;microcode updates&#x27;. Of course, you could just disable field programming, but why even use an FPGA in the first place?<p>Disclaimer: I believe Joanna is much smarter than I am, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if my comments are based on a fundamental misunderstanding.",1450961006

So client 1&#x27;s txn gets sent to F+1 drawn from A-E. In your scenario A and B are down so that only leaves C, D and E. So they vote on the txn and vote to Commit. This vote forms a Paxos round as per Gray and Lamport&#x27;s paper &quot;Consensus on transaction commit&quot;. Assuming that all these votes get received and written to disk by at least F+1 acceptors (which will almost certainly also be C, D, and E), and that C, D and E all form the exact same overall outcome then consensus has been achieved: the outcome is fixed and stable.<p>A and B come up at the same time that C and D go down. C, D and E all knew (in their role as acceptors, not voters) that the result of that txn has to go to _all_ of A-E. So when A and B come up, E will see this and send them the txn outcome. Now A and B can&#x27;t progress at this point yet because they&#x27;ve only seen the outcome from one acceptor (E), not the minimum F+1. So as they spot C and D are down, they will start additional paxos rounds to try and get the txn aborted. Those rounds will _have_ to contact E, and they will find that actually the txn votes led to a commit. Now A and B will also play the role of acceptor, taking over from the failed C and D. Thus we&#x27;ll finally have A B and E as acceptors all with the original commit votes, they will form the same outcome, and all the voters and learners will get the same result. I realise this is probably not the cleanest explanation, but this is the chief purpose of consensus algorithms in general: once a majority (F+1) of nodes form consensus about something, that consensus can never change, and can only be propagated further.<p>> Client 2 tries to read, contacting nodes A, B, C, F, G. 4 out of the 5 respond successfully, so it calls it good. But it can&#x27;t possibly read the value that client 1 wrote.<p>Client 2 is trying to read object x and object x only exists on A-E, not F and G. So client 2 cannot ask F and G to take part. I assume you mistyped and meant A, B, and E, not C as I thought C and D were down at this point.<p>Client 2 will get A B and E to vote on this next transaction and that will occur as normal as we have only have 2 failures currently (C and D).<p>> Whatever way you do it, the number of nodes contacted for a write + number of nodes contacted for a read has to add up to more than the cluster size.<p>No, that&#x27;s not true. It has to add up to more than the number of replicas of an object. That can be much less than the cluster size in GoshawkDB. This property is not true of several other data stores.<p>> If your cluster is somehow sharded then you can work around this with e.g. consistent hashing (so that client 2 knows which 5 of the 7 nodes a particular key must be stored on, and contacts the correct subset), but that only works if client 2 can know what the key was<p>Yes, this is exactly what GoshawkDB does (though my consistent hashing algorithms are quite unlike the norm).<p>> and I think Cassandra already supports that<p>Maybe - I&#x27;m certainly not a cassandra expert. I&#x27;m pretty sure cassandra does not support full transactions. For example: <a href=""https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/dml/dml_about_transactions_c.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/dml/dml...</a><p>&quot;Cassandra supports atomicity and isolation at the row-level, but trades transactional isolation and atomicity for high availability and fast write performance&quot;.<p>Which is fair enough - there&#x27;s definitely a use case for the properties that Cassandra offers - as I&#x27;ve written on the GoshawkDB website, GoshawkDB is certainly not a competitor of Cassandra.

With GoshawkDB it really is up to the client as to what API you offer. For languages which allow you full proxies of all object field gettors and settors then you should be able to match ZODB, and that would certainly be the goal. But without that sort of support in the programming language, the only other way to get there is to define your object types externally, and then compile special classes that do the magic for you. That too is something I&#x27;ll look at for GoshawkDB: it&#x27;s likely to ultimately be faster than relying on reflection and other techniques.<p>An awful lot of problems with these sorts of products are caused by the same terminology being used for different meanings.

E.g. my forever-in-progress Ruby compiler has a stage where it makes closures explicit: It allocates an environment to store variables in and rewrites variable accesses accordingly. For following stages the language I&#x27;m working on is different: I can no longer use closures.<p>The more stages you have, the more language dialects you need to manage to mentally separate when working on the stages.

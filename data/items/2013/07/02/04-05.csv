5975916,comment,5973971,5975704,1,0,zhoutong,,,"As you have said, the creation/redemption mechanism will enable fair price discovery. The inability of shorting the underlying doesn&#x27;t matter here, because if the ETF can be redeemed freely, an investor can buy the underpriced ETF and redeem immediately and sell in the spot market.<p>The only difference of this from actually shorting is the time. During the time of this operation, there may be adverse movement in the underlying price making the arbitrage too risky. It&#x27;s true that fully efficient arbitrage may not happen.<p>But saying that there&#x27;s no mechanism to maintain equilibrium price of the ETF is entirely wrong. If the ETF price is $60/BTC and the spot is $85/BTC, there&#x27;s a huge incentive for investors to buy ETF and redeem and then sell in the spot market, even if it takes days. People who already have both BTC and USD in their hands can also quickly increase their BTC holdings, for free!<p>Therefore, the ability to short underlying simply doesn&#x27;t matter, as long as ETFs can be created and redeemed fairly freely.",1372740933

You were asking why they got the funding, not if it would work.  Very different propositions -- they only have to get to 1 in 10 odds to make it worth funding.<p>...<p>But as for the points,<p>1 & 2.  It&#x27;s a better marketing proposition than Facebook is today if done right.  There is $17B spent on postage and maybe about $30B spent on printing in direct mail today in the US alone.  Once you get penetration, the ads will come to you digitally and would know what people want (because they will tell you by opting out what they don&#x27;t) and you have rooftop location which Facebook doesn&#x27;t have or doesn&#x27;t expose.<p>Trust me -- this is my business.  A good replacement for direct mail is giant opportunity.<p>3. Yeah, I don&#x27;t like the last mile part either.  Will and Evan do.  However, it is clearly a place to extract value if they can saturate the dense zip-codes and have a good relationship with the individuals.  It is no different than JetBlue taking traffic on major routes.  The USPS is burdened with Rural delivery.  UPS and FedEx prove that Urban delivery can be profitable.<p>4. Bill Pay.  The existing services in this market charge the biller $0.75 to deliver.  The biller saves on printing so both sides win.  This is a proven market with PayTrust being the pioneer.  At scale, it is clearly a good revenue source.  Outbox is a natural to capture business from the existing services.<p>5. Saturating zips.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve demonstrated that the costs won&#x27;t work.  You assume a certain ratio of FTE to customers and then say it is impossible.  That same type of logic is why everyone said UPS and FedEx would never work.  I don&#x27;t know if you are right. But these VCs are not dumb money -- they probably have better numbers on this than you do.  This is exactly what they are testing in Austin and SF today so, internally, they have some decent estimates of the costs.<p>...<p>6. How often do you get mail that you care about?  For me, it is once per week at most.  Using Outbox lets you change what you get in the mail.  People will opt-out because it is easy.  Thus, people are likely to wind up with only a few items being delivered per month once Outbox builds relationships with the billers and stops the paper advertisers.<p>ps - I don&#x27;t think they are talking about a smart mailbox.

I realize it&#x27;s a fairly heretical belief to hold on this site but I think boys are systematically discriminated against in most western societies.<p>As a child that teachers (nearly all women) tended to be biased against boys and downright dismissive of male dominated interests such as science fiction, video games or arm-wrestling.  Talking with students in recent years, I get the impression that my teachers were actually <i>more</i> tolerant of boys than most current K12 teachers are.  Invariably boys get punished more severely for similar infractions, boys are more likely to be forced onto medication and more likely to receive &quot;tough love&quot; in the face of academic difficulties.<p>Compounding this is that even in this day and age when there&#x27;s nearly a 3-2 ratio of females to males in college, it&#x27;s the boys who get fewer grants, fewer sex-specific support organizations and less support in general.  This chasm continues, even for mid-career adults.  Many organizations provide women with free training in various fields, including tech (see Railsbridge, Women Who Code, etc) and allow men only as guests of women at all.  In fact the <i>amazingly</i> good hacker school I went to charges men $2000 more than women.<p>Things probably still seem okay at this point due to the fact that the trends have gradually been getting more extreme and the educational imbalances weren&#x27;t so bad 15-30 years ago, when much of the workforce was in formal schooling.  But the swelling ranks of disenfranchised young men is a demographic that isn&#x27;t going to be good news for anyone, including women.",1372738583

On the average, most startups fail.  &quot;On the average&quot; is usually not taken as a reason to not do something by this community (HN), at least allegedly.<p>Second--there are <i>plenty</i> of reasonable issues to raise whenever this comes up. For instance--your average investor is going to have a tough time of this--for starters due to transaction costs, taxes, etc. Then again, your average investor is going to have a tough time of the stock market in general.

5975744,comment,5971356,5971356,4,0,kenster07,,,"-This article strikes a chord with me. I remember I was placed a year ahead in math, in Algebra I Honors, and the class was so easy that I would bring little toys into class and play with them while still getting A&#x27;s. The teacher, a female, sent me back to Pre-algebra as a result. In hindsight, that reaction was so patently absurd. If anything, she should have tested whether I should have advanced to Geometry Honors.<p>-I don&#x27;t think anyone is surprised that the article claims that boys perform better under conditions which simulate actual adult workplace conditions.<p>-A bigger issue is really the education system targeting the median student. That means those students with the highest potential have to fight against the system to reach it -- if they ever reach it at all. And holding back the brightest people, when the economy is advanced by that small percent of bright people, sounds horribly ineffective.<p>This educational system is an artificial structure imposed on people with disparate learning capabilities, trying to fit every peg under the sun into a square hole, and I think we&#x27;ve missed out on a lot of value because of that.<p>Hopefully, as automation increases, this is something we&#x27;ll be able to improve upon.",1372737721

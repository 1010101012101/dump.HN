The spirit was spelled out by fsf and rms very well in things like the free software definition, and faqs about the purpose of the license etc. Not disallowing tivoization was an oversight in the legal code which needed to be corrected for the spirit to remain what it had been. Linus thinks the spirit was in the exact legal code. That is more like &quot;the letter of the license&quot;, not the spirit.<p>> I also don&#x27;t want a future where all you can buy are locked-down devices, but is the GPL really the right venue to fight that battle?<p>Is it legal for software to defraud people, to act explicitly for ransom/extortion, or purposely kill people by stopping their medical devices? No. If it was, and it was happening a lot, I bet a copyright license that had something to say about that would be popular. Consumer owned devices which attempt to force people to use specific software for no technical reason, just so they can make more profit from the user, should be illegal outside of any copyright license. Until that happens, then yes gpl is one of the right venues.<p>> Isn&#x27;t it better that they release locked-down hardware but contribute their code changes, so that if someone wants to make competing open hardware they can start with all the same driver & feature support in Linux?<p>Ya, right now it&#x27;s that way, especially since they don&#x27;t do a good job of locking things down and you can circumvent it on most phones.

If you take that $1300 Macbook, add 30% and convert that to Euros it just happens to be that it works out at about €1300 which is what they charge in Germany. Someone posted about that here earlier.<p>Most of that 30% is due to VAT at around 20% for much of Europe, plus another 10%. It&#x27;s that last 10% that&#x27;s the real price difference of the goods.<p>Personally, I think the main cause of that is the generally higher cost of doing business in Europe (UK included). Everything costs more here. Petrol (Gas) and hence transport, wages, property, corporate tax rates, etc. It&#x27;s hard, if possible at all, to find anything that&#x27;s cheaper over here and all of that feeds in to the cost of doing business.

I only have a certain number of paintings &quot;in me&quot; before burnout sets in, so I make sure to only stop and look at stuff that I really feel drawn to.  This has made visiting museums vastly more pleasurable than it used to be, when I would dutifully look at six rooms of Egyptian antiquities or Byzantine icons and find I had nothing in the tank when I got to the stuff that had attracted me to the museum in the first place.<p>That said, the art museums in Holland tend to be terrific about limiting what they display. It&#x27;s not like the Louvre, where you wander for miles through rooms of mind-numbing portraiture.  Dutch museums, especially the smaller ones, have a handful of masterpieces and then a big cafe where you can eat apple cake and recharge for a second pass.<p>If you can manage it, it helps not to read any text, either.

The only time currency conversion matters is because you are converting between two currencies, when buying a product from another country.<p>GOG.com sells all their games in north american prices because it only has offices in north america.

You will pay less for the phone but when it crosses the border you pay considerable taxes such that the &quot;deal&quot; is no longer worth it.<p>If import taxes were applied to physical as well as digital goods, as they probably should be, you would actively want to buy from a European company within Europe.

8252615,comment,8251288,8251288,3,0,VLM,,,"The largest failing of the article is in the &quot;Existing Approaches To Fix These Problems&quot; where its ack&#x27;d that this is attempt number one zillion to fix some old problems, and here is a slightly different approach.... the problem specifically being lack of analysis of past failures to improve the new proposal.  We&#x27;re just going to end up with POSIX / LSB again, except maybe less successful because its obviously going to be immensely more complicated.  Its possible that analysis was done but not documented.<p>The tone of the article is very strange, like someone who has no experience with distros or sysadmin work came in with a blank slate from an unrelated field, like perhaps sorting algo research.  I simply can&#x27;t identify with most of his postulates, so its no surprise I was all WTF at the proposed solution.  Or rephrased, its an academically interesting idea in an abstract sense, but seems to be unrelated to, and not useful for, the existing real world.

Believe me, it is not even close of an editor (of friends and family proof reading). It is not a &quot;read over&quot;.<p>It is more like this: the consultant make the interview, just like the ghost writer, to know what to write about. Then the consultant tells the applicant to write about &quot;this, this and that. In this way, and don&#x27;t forget to mention this and this&quot;.<p>Then the aplicant write it. The consultant read it all and says: &quot;this sentence is out of place, you don&#x27;t need this one, you must include another one on this paragraph&quot;. And this go on and on, 5, 6 or even 10 times. Keep in mind that these are essays of one or two pages. The end result has nothing to do with any original writing from the applicant.

I <i>hate</i> 'news' stories about how we should all be outraged and boycot something. It's a ton of sheep following some ill advised, likely false rumor half the time. It's just kids in the playground trying to exercise mob rule.<p>There was a news story, saying how Apple have changed their wording to disallow non-approved languages for developing apps. Great. That's news. But 100+ follow up 'opinion pieces' on it? srsly? Do we need all that crap? 10 out of the top 22 stories on HN are about this one item!<p>The biggest mistake Apple has made IMHO has been opening the app store to all developers. They should have carefully selected chosen, quality partners, who would agree to play by Apples rules.<p>At the end of the day though, the general public doesn't care one bit how Apple ""treat"" developers, so it's all fairly moot.<p>If you take some principled stand by not making <i>another</i> worms game because you can't write it in clojure, you can be sure as hell someone else will just get on with it and write it in whatever Apple want.",1270835760

That is, if you plan to base a business on the iPad, iPod, iPhone platform.<p>It's also a somewhat stunning to see people pondering whether or not Apple can be sued. Clearly most people here are unfamiliar with the licensing terms of other mobile gaming platforms. The terms for Nintendo, for example, are far more egregious. And if the mobile gaming terms scare you, then you should refrain from even looking at the terms for big three console development.<p>My point is that if this is to change, it will not be in court that the change happens. Running to the government should, in general, be avoided in all entrepreneurial activities. It invites 'help', of the kind that may be unintended.<p>Vote with your IP on this issue. If you think these terms are bad, don't develop for Apple's platform. If enough developers stop developing for it, things will change.<p>If you try to get around it by using something like Unity that compiles to C, Apple is just going to gain access to Unity, ascertain the 'fingerprints' if you will, and ban you on that basis. Software forensics has been around a good deal longer than Unity, so I would not bet against it. The only question is whether or not Apple cares to be strident about these rules. And if I am investing my money, I wouldn't bet against that either.<p>And really, why play cat and mouse, when you can develop elsewhere? For web, or for Android, if Google ever figures out how to deliver a package attractive to consumers.<p>I realize I am proposing that we engage in a massive game of the Prisoner's Dilemma, but talking to Apple won't work.

Some forms of creation require a large amount of time and effort.  Some people will squeeze in time around their jobs and friends and families no matter what so that they can create.  Other people will not.<p>But even if you're right, I want some creative people to be able to create full time.  If I can get twice the output from Neal Stephenson or John Darnielle or Linus Torvalds because they don't have to work a separate day job, that is a world I want to promote.  This doesn't mean that copyrights should be defined the way they are, or that copyrights are even the way to achieve this world, but don't act like economic compensation for creativity isn't useful.",1270832653

It's the artificialness that bothers me.<p>Our culture has come to think ideas are <i>real</i> like real estate. But they are not. They are intangible, and so is information. This feels an awful lot like the meme ""ideas are cheap; execution is everything"".<p>As all media become more like raw information--as the cost of transmission and storage of media falls--it will act more like <i>ideas</i>. All that will be left is the government grant to exclusive rights. Thus IP holders lobby governments for larger and larger hammers to beat down infringement.<p>And anyway, the point of limited IP terms is to allow derivative works for the greater good. I don't hear this greater good argument often enough.<p>The system is flawed. Perhaps short copyright terms as the article suggests are more workable as the information will be fresh. It may also be the only realistic solution when the time comes that infringement is effectively free (as in beer).",1270832503

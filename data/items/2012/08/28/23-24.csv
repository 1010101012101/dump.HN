4446445,comment,4446400,4446400,2,0,alecdibble,,,"In my own experience, diet had a much more dramatic effect on my day-to-day mood. Switching to basically a slow carb diet helped my mood and outlook tremendously.<p>EDIT: I wanted to add that exercise also has a great effect on my mood, but only temporarily. By following a consistent diet that (in my case) is low glycemic and high in protein, the stability of my mood was much greater than exercise alone.<p>I do not have time to read the whole paper right now, but one question I have about the results is the prescribed exercise. In my experience, the type of exercise I do can have very different affects in how it makes me feel afterwards. For example, my mood is stabilized for much longer if I do 15 minutes of interval sprints rather than a 30 minute run. Cycling will also make me feel much different than high-weight/low-rep weightlifting.<p>What I am getting at is that if the ""exercise"" routine was run for 30 minutes 2 time a week, I could easily see how that would not affect depression. However, if it was a regime of HIIT or heavy compound exercises (squat/deadlift/bench), I would be very surprised if people didn't see long term mood benefits.",1346198162

To my surprise, Firefox seems to have improved a lot in the last few versions. It feels much snappier and more responsive than Chrome, which was not the case for a long time. Looking at other stuff, like download page experience, anti-aliased fonts on pages by default and overall look and feel, one can see that Mozilla has put a lot of effort into fixing the problems and trying to get back to #1 spot in terms of being the most advanced browser.<p>Competition from Chrome has awaken them from sleep and finally we are starting to see a very fast, slick browser. Given all the plugin ecosystem, Firefox could be back on top. The only problem is that they might be a little bit too late with these improvements, and it would be hard to win back the users that switched to Chrome.

You'll <i>still</i> have to go find the actual block of JS that's defining doThis(), and that will still be someplace else.<p>Yes, it might be nice to have that short descriptive name associated with the button, but that's what class=""does-this"" is for.<p>Other arguments against inline JS:<p>It's harder to test the case where JS is turned off.<p>It's harder to ensure that all buttons of class ""play"" have the ""playMe()"" function attached.

Similarly, if you decide that buttons should call playMeLoudly() instead of playMe(), you have a lot more lines of code to change.<p>With inline JS you are always one missing quote character away from a security incident.

4446414,comment,4445570,4446268,2,0,mikeryan,,,"I'll answer since I run an agency - note we're a design and dev shop and this is affects both sides of the coin.<p>First I take a bit of umbrage at the term the ""agency"" mindset because it seems to indicate its <i>our</i> fault. Its more of the ""agency relationship* mindset.<p>Unfortunately despite that its a bit true. We generally are in the business of getting things done and out the door so we can go onto the next project. Its very much the nature of the business. But a lot of this is also driven by our clients. The best clients realize this is a phased a approach and build in separate phases to accomodate user testing A/B testing and realize that the work isn't done after the work is dropped. Its great when we get clients such as these, because we get to really focus on the product. Unfortunately they are few and far between.  Most are much more budget focused and when we bring things up like A/B testing and phased approaches, they get excited, when we show them the costs for this kind of work, most of the time these kinds of ""extras"" are what gets dropped.<p>Now part of this problem also comes from larger agencies. There's some folks out there who won't do a project thats not $500k or larger. Trying to tack on an additional $100k of improvements post delivery isn't something they're interested in doing. This isn't just hubris, if you're running a shop of 100 folks a ""small"" 100k project presents problems, it utilizes resources better used elsewhere, and you'd be running your sales and account folks ragged managing 4 or 5 of these small projects (One account manager on one 500k project is a lot better then one on five 100k projects).<p>This tends to get worse on the dev side, for dev we do the best we can to get a nice clean codebase out the door, but frankly once it ""works"" its done. Unlike design which actually does have some iterations and polish built into the design process dev is more ""does it work to spec"" and done.<p><i>A solid agency will help to identify any caveats and get the design to a point where it doesn't have to be iterated on.</i><p>I'm not sure this is true, the better the creatives working on a project the closer you'll get to it, but its always a tradeoff against budget and time.",1346197066

4446408,comment,4445506,4446232,2,0,moxie,,,"Interestingly, that was the first time I'd heard of f-droid as well.  =)<p>I think my objections to f-droid are actually connected to the hesitations I have around a lot of what's happening in the ""open"" Android space.  The ""rooting"" community is a perfect example: people want to be able to write certain kinds of software for their devices, but aren't able to, and so they've developed ""open"" solutions that allow them to.  Their original constraint, however, was the Android security model, and the problem is that their solution was just to destroy it.<p>I really like the fact that Android has a security model focused on application rather than user isolation (what typical PC environments do).  My only complaint is that I wish it were stronger.  Rather than adapting this nice security model to meet their needs (adding additional permissions, etc) the ""open Android"" community converged on just running shit as root instead (a reversion back to the PC environment).<p>I think f-droid is potentially another example of an attempt to make Android resemble the PC environment.  It feels to me as if they're trying to be the ""debian"" of Android, in the sense that they're taking random OSS software that they find, packaging it, and distributing it through their own repository.  There's a tool to pull down packages from a repository and install them, just like with Debian.<p>The first big problem with this approach comes with application signatures.  Where signatures in Debian are only relevant to the debian tool itself, signatures in Android are relevant and <i>enforced by</i> the system.  The owner of the key for a signed APK is the only person who can distribute future versions of that application, meaning that as a developer, I'm not capable of distributing software to users who've installed the f-droid version without f-droid's assistance.  In the case you mentioned, users were running a version of my software that needed to be updated, but I had no ability to give them the update.<p>Given the way f-droid works, this also means that all the signing keys for all software are being stored <i>online</i> in one place, which probably isn't a great idea and will almost certainly bite them eventually.<p>I could go on about why I'm not enthusiastic about this project, but all of my objections are connected to this theme.  I think it's possible to develop an open ecosystem that's as secure or even more secure than what Android's default security model provides, but I think it requires making choices that are going to be more work than just flattening the security model back to PC-land.",1346196903

I actually skim them all; I'm one of two people I know who doesn't use filters, and I think the other one gave up recently.

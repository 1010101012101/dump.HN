158318,comment,158029,158296,0,0,raganwald,,,"Google launched and showed off an example application that rips Campfire's look and feel off. As for whether it was a ""pioneering new chat interface,"" that is hardly the point where ripping off design is concerned.<p>It's just like ripping off the layout and visual appearance of a designer's portfolio web site. There is nothing pioneering or innovative about the way designers make web sites to display their work, but there <i>is</i> design in the chocies they make and there is value in those choices.<p>If design doesn't matter, Google could and should show a chat application with a completely different look. If design does matter, then they are executing a blatant rip off.<p>Is it illegal? Wrong? <i>Lame</i>? You can decide for yourself. But it is still a rip off.<p><i>update</i>: This is my last word on the subject. But I will say the following: there is a very well-known standard of ""obviousness"": The Clean Room.<p>Perhaps this application was made in a clean room, or something close enough: if the people making it weren't familiar with Campfire and arrived at almost the identical design from first principles, then of couse I am happy to withdraw my statement and accept that the design in ""obvious.""<p>Perhaps they have already spoken up and assured the world that it is just a coincidence that their app is so similar to Campfire. But I am not convinced that a particular design is ""obvious"" if it is executed by someone who studied another design first.",1207690997

158315,comment,158285,158285,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"1. There's something very wrong with the English/German translation.   It's frequently not finding the German equivalent and just printing the English word.  e.g. It claims that the German translation of Cook is Cook.<p>2. When presenting a word like Cook you really need to distinguish between nouns and verbs.  There's a big difference between der Koch and kochen.<p>3. You don't present the gender of any of the words.  This is very important if you are to learn almost any language other than English.  You just can't make the adjectives etc. match if you don't know the gender (and there are words that change meaning with gender: e.g. le tour and la tour in French).<p>4. I think it would be very helpful to have the words actually spoken outloud by your widget.<p>5. My experience of learning a foreign language to fluency is that there's no substitute for speaking to people.  For my first months in France I was constantly asking people in shops, the street, etc. to explain bits of French to me.  For example, I'd pick a word in a newspaper headline and ask the baker what it meant.   This really helped.   Currently I'm learning German and find myself asking people Wie sagt man X auf Deutsch? a lot.",1207690610

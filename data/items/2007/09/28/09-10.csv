If the rating system could also rate items for you based on the interests of those who rated the page, where the rating value would be a function of the similarity of interests to yours, then it would no longer be eternal September.  The only thing missing would be a meta commenting system, similarly constructed.<p>That the system would be based on existing networks would ensure the cross pollination of ideas between different interest groups.",1190970549

That's what I do for most emails and it works pretty well for me. \nThat is a good advise. \nI'll give it a try.\nAnyway, one of the reasons which brought me into this post is the fact that I use Gmail, with Gmail, there is a short-cut for 'send' by hitting <tab> and then <enter>, It happened more than once that I typed this sequence without any intention to send the message and ptooof! the message is gone. I simply wanted a new paragraph but the message has already gone.  I am afraid this one has not been proofed by your suggestion.<p>I couldn't understand what do you mean by delaying messages. I never meant to create a delay but an ability that my server will withdraw the message from the recipient's server if I asked for it and the recipient has not yet been aware of my message, that is, didn't logged in to the server since I sent or something alike .",1190970486

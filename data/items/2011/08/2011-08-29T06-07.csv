Certainly, someone who has been driving every day for 20 years will usually be a better driver than someone who has been driving every day for 20 days. I suspect the difference between 2 years and 20 isn't all that dramatic though.<p>I further suspect that most driving is not <i>practice</i>, by which I mean that drivers are not actively thinking about their driving and how to be better at it. Most of us, once we're reasonably proficient stop actively thinking about the act of driving entirely unless an unusual situation occurs.<p>If your second reason turns out to be correct, then it also means that a larger percentage of driving than before isn't useful practice for avoiding crashes since highway driving tends to be safe and predictable.",1314601002

Many American professional sports leagues have a greater percentage of black players than white players.  Both of these facts lead me to believe that the black people in the Americas have a genetic advantage due to filtering out of weaker individuals through the trials brought on by slavery.<p>Consider- many modern American and Jamaican blacks are descendants of slaves.  To arrive in the Americas those slaves had to survive a horrendous journey across the Atlantic in a slave ship (a far more physically challenging experience than the one experienced by the average European colonist on his trip across the ocean).  They then had to survive the physical challenges associated with being a slave.  The net result is that descendants of these slaves have a genetic profile that was passed down from the strongest survivors, making them physically stronger than either African blacks or non-black Americans.",1314600595

2936224,comment,2935944,2935944,11,0,jacques_chester,,,"Systems theorists say that ""structure predicts behaviour"". It's a bit trite, but also deep. Here's an example.<p>The US political system pretty much guarantees bad budgeting. Members of Congress are elected fairly independently. There is no party discipline, so each member will operate independently to maximise pork. This encourages  horse-trading within and across party lines; nobody can be forced to give up something for a general good.<p>There's more: there's no incentive to balance the budget. The Executive's separation means that Congress does not need to concern itself with proper administration; it only doles out the cash. It has every incentive to ... maximise pork.<p>The dynamic behaviour of American government arises from the static structure. The drafters of the constitution drew on their knowledge of history and current affairs to try and avoid certain pitfalls. The US Constitution was state-of-the-art when it was written. It's less so now.<p>Countries where the Executive is formed out of the Legislative -- the Westminster system -- tend to have much stronger party discipline, because that discipline is required to pass budgets, enact legislation and to form the Executive. This tends to almost eliminate horse-trading, except between parties and independents. It's not perfect -- whole parties can engage in pork too -- but when policy emerges that benefits the many at the cost of a few, countries with party discipline will find it easier to adopt than those without.<p>Australia, which has the amongst the toughest party discipline in the democratic world, is also a reform leader. And I think a lot of that is explained by our constitutional arrangements.",1314600253

Randomly selected jurors did quite a few nasty and arbitrary things. But an elected tyrant (especially one who was willing to do <i>anything</i> to stay popular) might be worse. It's hard to say that sortation is bad because it allowed mistakes - every political system allows mistakes.<p>Also, systematic slavery, misogyny, the occasional genocide and other discrimination against non-male-citizens (non-voters) was a problem, but that's not really related to sortation.

    the handful of PLs that everyone with a broad interest in programming should  
    learn, but that the limitations of its basic computational mechanism make it 
    uncompetitive as a general PL. I find that Haskell, through the list of 
    successes paradigm, is usually a better language for writing the kind of 
    programs Prolog is good at than Prolog.

    I think the LP community should be seriously looking for a successor. There's 
    no shortage of candidates.

I have two reasons:<p>First, as miles driven increases, driver experience increases.  Accidents are much more common among (I'm guessing) 16 year olds with a freshly minted license than a 40 year old.<p>Second, as miles driven per year increases, the percentage of driving time spent on the freeway increases (due to taking long trips, presumably the major source of milage increase), but accidents are less likely on the freeway.  This argument is admittedly much more specious than the first.<p>Following this reasoning, it is not at all clear that ""the improvements in safety are even more dramatic if you consider the average person is driving about 3000 more miles per year than they were in 1975"" because those extra miles may not be the most dangerous miles.",1314599199

I would say that is just part of our way of living, in a society of people. The only way for us to have no consumers, is if we are all self sustaining, hunter gatherers really.<p>Perhaps at one point our species was consumerless, but the fact is, we work way better in a group, which means there will be consumers. I like turning steel into usable objects, I don't like mining it, there for I must be a consumer at some level. If I was forced to produce everything I needed to build something complex, like say a PCB board and components, it would take a life time to get everything necessary to produce something not all that spectacular.<p>I think the ""bad"" part of consumerism, is more a psychological state, like using drugs to escape a problem. Consuming on its own, isn't necessarily bad and you're right, very necessary. Perhaps its all psychologically based, I feel better building something, more than I do just waiting around for the next movie, or video game to distract me from my life. But really, whats the difference if what I produced just ends up sitting in the corner collecting dust, why I'm building something else?<p>In that sense, being a Producer, requires a Consumer, someone else to find what you have made useful. Otherwise all I've been is a consumer. Producing at worst, is a consumer, at best, helping make society a better place. Consumer at best is a Producer, at worst, just collecting, and creating a market, for junk to be eventually thrown away.",1314598513

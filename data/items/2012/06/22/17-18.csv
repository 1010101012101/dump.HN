A master's thesis in itself doesn't mean much; it doesn't have to present new results nor have any impact.  Presumably this student had to complete the coursework required for the degree, and his adviser let him wank around with lolcats for the thesis.  The thesis alone didn't earn him the degree, and given that the bar isn't that high for master's theses anyway, it's not that big of a deal.",1340387976

Perhaps that narrow definition is constrained to the file level. It's like a musical instrument to manipulate files.  Once you know it well, it feels just like that.  I am not saying that this is the only definition, it's just what I am coming-up with now.<p>Once we deviate from whatever the narrow definition of where vim is more efficient the claims start to fall apart.  This doesn't happen because of vim but rather because it is the very nature of creating software:  Things take time and saving keystrokes at the file-editing level isn't going to bring a project to completion six months earlier and with less bugs.<p>I wear at least two hats: developer and businessman.  I am forced to look at things from both angles, because, well, I have to pay for the consequences of my own decisions.  For example, if I succumb to my natural inclination to keep adding features it means that I might have ten programmers busy for weeks chasing an ever-moving project completion milestone.  So, as a business person, I do my best to control these urges and look at things through a different equation.  Eventually you have to call it ""done"" and move on.<p>Over the years I have never seen any code entry tool that truly makes a serious dent in software project timelines.  Software projects are notorious for being late and over-budget.  And this has absolutely nothing to do with the tools we use.  Zero.  A better editor or IDE will not make a dent on overall project timeline.  Anyone who can figure out a way to solve that problem can become an ""instant"" billionaire.",1340387576

(Though I would concede if your only choices are Ruby's Rails, Python's Django, and PHP's Yii, for many problems there isn't much to compel you to one or the other besides your preference and available talent.) I could write a large comment going over the pros/cons for different use-cases of PHP (plain or with a framework like Yii), Python (with Flask), Java (with enunciate), and Node.JS (those are the only languages/environments I've built larger-than-toy webapps with; I still need an excuse to use Clojure's Noir for something). My list would not just be language-war pros/cons but business value considerations and hypothetical consequences. It's not the most important choice you can make, but it should be considered if there's more than one option because the type of problem you're solving can be made much simpler or easier with the right tool.<p>I think you've got the right mindset, and that's to use what you know for anything important you need to finish soon, but I'd recommend checking out the other environments on your own time just for fun. Also before starting a project, research to see if it's a solved (or mostly solved) problem for another framework/language. Even if there's a learning cost to something brand new, depending on the problem it can be well worth it for the overall cost reduction that the tool provides. There are a lot of ""We learned and used/migrated to Erlang"" stories out there because Erlang solves particular problems very well.",1340387044

Using clips and pins misrepresents the product.<p>I really appreciate transparency and clarity in <i>exactly</i> how a garment is cut. Some sellers accomplish this wonderfully. One such seller is Mr. Porter. On their online catalog, you can see that some garments do not fit perfectly on the model because that is simply how the garment naturally hangs without clips/pin/tailoring. They also give the model's measurements so that you can compare your sizes to the models and a size chart. This has been enough for me to accurately judge how a garment will fit me even without trying it on! (Example: <a href=""http://www.mrporter.com/product/301852"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mrporter.com/product/301852</a> , select ""Size & Fit""). Another website that does this is Amazon's myhabit.com<p>I don't mind GQ using clips and pins. GQ is presenting what is possible. A store, on the other hand, should show what they are trying to sell, and I believe using clips misrepresents their wares by obscuring the exact nature of their wares: sizing, cut, how it hangs, what would have to be tailored, etc.",1340387028

Your car wouldnt start (or brake, or steer, or do anything really). Trains, without signaling, would be dead weight. Automatic doors at the entrance to your office, school, or favorite coffee shop would remain resolutely shut. Your PC, your DVD player, your wireless router, your digital camera, your smartphone  all computers everywhere would be dead.<p>I feel that he's trying to overstate the role of modern electrical activity in our lives. Using myself as a counterexample:<p>* I, along with many other people, wake up without an alarm clock of any sort. And Mechanical alarm clocks exist, and are completely suitable.<p>* I do actually have a gas grill, along with most self-respecting cooks, it's a superior heating element. (I also cannot eat toast) and other than the starter, that continues to work without power.<p>* I do not take a car to work, an average car, while technically uses ""electricity"" it is never connected to the electrical grid, and afaik, the only reason it needs a battery is for the starter, which there are other ways around. Additionally, very few of the fundamental properties of a car are dependent on electricity. In fact many cars on the road today will continue to function (however poorly without power steering and the like) without electricity.<p>* The fact that signaling for trains is electrical, is a symptom of convenience, not a fundamental requirement.<p>* None of the doors I encounter frequently are automatic, not at my home, my office, or any of the coffee shops, or stores I frequent. Other than large department stores, automatic doors seem to be the exception.<p>* Yes, all my electrical devices would be dead, but seriously mentioning ""DVD Player"" as if it's important.<p>Then he goes on to completely skip the most noticeable life-changer when electricity goes out, Lighting. Modern electrical lighting has to be the most significant way that electricity affects our lives, and completely transforms the night.<p>That's not to say removal of electricity won't cause problems, specifically the ""Instant"" removal of electricity, but our fundamental dependence on it seems exaggerated.",1340387007

There's a giant simplification that occurs in games like World of Warcraft and now Team Fortress 2, where the only cost of arbitrage is the cost of finding out where opportunities exist. There are still interesting things to examine in games where transactions are instantaneous and safe, like how much risk people are willing to float by holding stock in intermediate goods, but the <i>really</i> interesting thing to me is examining communities where moving items around has real costs associated.<p>I would expect that the TF2 economy tends towards an equilibrium that is as simple as Yanis describes. This is probably not true in a game such as Eve. If one item is cheap to produce in on sector of space, and expensive in another, the equilibrium will reflect this fact: ""arbitrage"" opportunities will exist, and be stable, and be known by another name, ""trade routes"". There are real costs in transporting goods in Eve, for example the time cost of having a human pilot navigate a freighter, and the risk of being attacked by pirates.<p>In Eve you can have perfect information on the price and volume of transactions that occur, the movement of goods, the sovereignty of territory in which there are markets, the corporate affiliations of the people who operate firms and trade routes, and the wars and conflicts that arise between individuals and sovereign states.

Sometimes they get nothing as part of a settlement, other parts they receive some token coupon that usually has restrictions to make it useless. In no case is the opinion of the members of the class taken into consideration, nor do they have any right to object to settlements, nor are they normally informed of the settlement until after it has taken place.<p>In effect, it's a similar protection scheme to how Congress passed a law banning the filing of lawsuits against BP in return for them paying a fine for oil spillage that is vastly below the cost of fixing the damage.<p>Many actions that are labelled as ""settlements"" or ""fines"" are actually bribes paid to the legal system in return for total immunity from future lawsuits.",1340386310

I have well over twenty years of experience in the field, across multiple platforms, tools and languages.  I started out with machine language. Not assembler, actually typing in hex instruction codes into a keypad.

One of the first things you do after that is write an editor (in Forth) so you can start moving faster.<p>I have to say that in all of this time I have never had an editor get in the way of the programming task to such an extent that it can be considered an interruption.  Interruptions that disrupt the mental stack you refer to are very real and they suck, but, in my experience, the text editor is never the issue.<p>Again, thanks for your valuable input.

But it was still an antitrust violation, because it was, in effect, leveraging a monopoly in one market (Operating Systems) to produce gains in another (Browsers). This is along the same lines, except it is using a monopoly in the Operating Systems market to farther same monopoly.<p>> picking on a platform with 0% marketshare compared to a platform which does the same thing with ~80% marketshare and >90% profit share.<p>There's a huge difference here; Apple makes both the software and the hardware. Microsoft makes software and forces hardware makers to comply. And no one would even care about that requirement, if it weren't for their desktop OS monopoly. Again, leveraging monopoly in one market to farther gains (limit competition) in another.<p>It's not the 0% marketshare I care about. It's the monopoly abuse.<p>And I don't think anyone has a reasonable legal complaint against Xbox360 not running Linux even if it were 90% of the console market. Apple sells (Hardware+Software) they make themselves. Xbox360 is (Hardware+Software) Microsoft makes themselves. This is NOT the situation in the PC or non-apple phone or non-apple tablet market.<p>> OEMs are willing to add signing keys of other players, but no one is interested in starting or running an operation that can sign F/OSS kernels with their key(after checking if that it's not malware).<p>Microsoft charging $100 for certifying something is not malware is a joke. As was mentioned earlier in this thread, it is much more likely that they are after pirate OEM Win7 activations.<p>If I was a malware distributor, I would make sure that I submit - directly and indirectly - hundreds of bootloaders and kernels, many of them exploitable through buffer overflows or similar tactics.<p>I've been burned too many times with hardware that supposedly worked but turned out to only work well under windows (With bad ACPI kernel tables, and other such stuff), to trust the theory that everything will work out well.<p>The only way to fight this is legally.<p>> Perhaps your few K$ might be better spent on such a nonprofit organization or division of the Linux foundation instead of throwing it at lawyers?

RPM/APT have ways of dealing with <i>some</i> of this sort of thing, but python doesn't necessarily support it. Packagers would have to do things like patch both A and B to do things like ""import y45 as y"" and ""import y50 as y"". (I've seen this approach.) Of course, this breaks Packages C and D, neither of which are packaged, that want to use Y4.5 and Y5.0, respectively.<p>Multiply this by a dozen top-level packages and scores of dependencies with potentially sparring versions and it becomes a huge mess.<p>Consider that developers are keen on using the latest shiny bauble, and are thus pulling code directly from github/etc. The authors of these packages don't always advertise (because they don't know) strict requirements. They might say ""Doesn't work with Y5.0"", but they aren't aware that it won't work with Y4.4 and don't mention that.<p>Working out all of the interdependencies is why the ecosystem has <i>packagers</i> and <i>distributors</i>. These people do the thankless job of sorting this all out. But they can't keep up with the bleeding edge, and sometimes developers have nonstandard requirements, so developers still often resort to pulling from trunk (or local copies) instead of using packages.<p>Factor in the possibility that the system default python is ancient (2.4, 2.5) and the packages depend on newer versions (2.6, 2.7). (Sadly, there <i>are</i> systems that are running CentOS5 (python 2.4) with no hope of upgrade. I know of an internal production system that is still running Red Hat 9! What's that, py2.2?)<p>In the end the only reasonable approach is sandboxing via virtualenv.",1340384945

In other words, I expect them to be a significant percentage of the customer base. Treating them like customers instead of charity cases in a business aimed at adding value to their lives for a reasonable fee would improve their situation, not necessarily helping them get off the street but helping make life more bearable while on the street.

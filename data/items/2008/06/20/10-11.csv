222632,comment,222505,222605,0,0,elad,,,"Maybe part of the explanation is that it's very light-weight - the car in the photo looks tiny, it says it's made of fiberglass, and my guess is that the engine must also weigh much less than a comparable internal combustion engine (you don't need as much metal to contain the combustion...).<p>Of course, that probably comes with a heavy price to passenger safety. Fiberglass won't give you any protection in a crush. That may be the reason why Tata is involved and not some European manufacturer. The Euro market has some serious safety regulations.",1213958386

222623,comment,222364,222425,0,0,ssharp,,,"The entire ""build something people want"" mentality is flawed.  If I could raise enough money, I could build cars and give them away for free.  It's something people want and I would quickly own the market.  Sure, the low overhead of the web makes giving your service away for free more realistic but it doesn't make the business model any more valid given the inability for a lot of well-funded startups to become profitable.<p>It's not that difficult to monetize traffic but it is very difficult to monetize traffic to the levels that would justify the current web 2.0 valuations.  Maybe everyone is thinking that one day soon, we're going to see a revolution in advertising that will rain down on website owners.  I don't see it happening.<p>This blog post was dead on.",1213957525

222620,comment,222157,222407,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"I'm not entirely against school, when i was 14 i changed schools and in my new class there were mostly girls and a few nerds(you get to be there after two exams) so it was pretty good. I actually enjoined and was exited. I started learning literature, philosophy, history and was pretty good at that and it was fun(i sort of did the ""philosophical poetic teen who wears only black"" thing for a while) Well after i got in to programing it got really boring, so thats my problem now, if i want to go to college i have to study chemistry,biology, and a lot of other stuff which i might be interested in, but are not anywhere near my favorite disciplines. So i would describe it more like a waste of time after you get near enough to graduation. And i do think kids should be forced in schools, they just have to have some choice and control after a certain age.For me it was 14, but that differs so its impossible to please everybody.",1213957234

And saying ""scribd's service is annoying, but you can't blame them if someone takes advantage of it"" is a little silly. You're right about the dumb uses thing, but in this case the dumb use happens to be one of the intended uses. You can't blame HammerCo that their product sucks at driving screws, but they are absolutely responsible for ensuring that it doesn't suck at banging nails.",1213956880

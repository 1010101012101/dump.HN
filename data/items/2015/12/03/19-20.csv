TLS isn&#x27;t just useful to encrypt private data, it also makes sure what you see is what the site owner wanted you to see. With http/2, the overhead is minimal and with TLS 1.3 it might soon be gone completely (since it&#x27;s probably going to add a mode that avoids multiple round trips for the initial TLS handshake; encryption itself isn&#x27;t really an issue nowadays with AES-NI, etc.)",1449172783

Apparently Dolby bought BrightSide and now they are pushing for 12 bits.  16 bit ints will probably be enough for home use in practice.  Internally, most games that do HDR rendering use 16 bit floats for their intermediate frame buffers.  That format is popular in film production as well.  I would be surprised if consumer display tech ever bothered to go float16-over-DVI.

The college and the student already agreed upon a price the student should pay for their education, and when they graduate and the bills are paid, everyone is square. Companies within the larger systems in place in our country are no different. They pay money to file with the state, they pay taxes on all their profits, they pay payroll taxes which means they have to compensate their employees higher than they might otherwise, they pay regulation taxes, environmental taxes, etc. But most importantly, they pay people to work, which to me is exactly what they should be doing. By paying people for their labor, companies <i>are</i> paying for the system that provided for those people.<p>> This toxic thinking that a twentysomething takes more risk by trying to start his own company while early in his career deserves orders of magnitude better compensation for the risk he took, over many career people that will have to be persuaded to risk their career and reputations on this new company, who have families, mortgages, and serious obligations to others?<p>It sounds so easy from your armchair, doesn&#x27;t it? When it&#x27;s not your future on the line. When it&#x27;s not you that has to bear the full brunt of failure if you don&#x27;t succeed.<p>If Zuckerberg hadn&#x27;t taken the risk to drop out of a highly prestigious school, from which he could have leveraged to land any number of low risk, highly lucrative jobs, to create Facebook, then 10s of thousands of high paying jobs wouldn&#x27;t exist today. That kind of risk deserves a great reward, and wouldn&#x27;t you know it, Zuckerberg is every bit as interested in the general welfare of his fellow humans as the rest of us are.<p>> You act like the first 50 employees of your stupid app company aren&#x27;t taking a risk too. But they get 0.01%, while the founders get...? Fairly early on, you literally don&#x27;t have enough time in a day to do it all yourself, even if you wanted to, so you&#x27;re quite literally taking credit for more risk than you were actually able to take.<p>They are taking guaranteed salary and benefits and a little bit of equity, too. They understand exactly the amount of risk they took on and if they don&#x27;t they&#x27;re incredibly naive. If they were to offer their services for no compensation then they would absolutely deserve more equity. But if they only do so after it&#x27;s clear the company is well on its way to being successful then how does that represent any risk whatsoever? Where were they when nobody believed in the company and the founders were pumping in their own savings and taking no salary whatsoever? Until you&#x27;ve gone through that, you can&#x27;t understand what the risk is truly all about.<p>> Considering Paul Graham&#x27;s essay about how most of the work is ahead of you even when you start adding employees, how is the risk so skewed towards initial conditions versus the long path ahead?<p>Sure, most of the work is ahead of you, but that work is done by people <i>who get guaranteed salaries and benefits</i> and who can simply find a new job if the company goes south (with unemployment benefits waiting to soften the blow). People flock to successful companies because they are often too risk-averse to start their own, but just because they do good work doesn&#x27;t mean they are somehow entitled to the equity of a company, especially if they&#x27;re receiving industry standard compensation for their efforts.",1449172284

The failure of the high-fat diet to alter fatty acid taste thresholds among OW/OB subjects suggests that these individuals were &#x27;adapted&#x27; to high-fat exposure, perhaps because of differences in habitual fat consumption.

The most valuable intervention -- whether its dietary changes, exercise changes, medication, surgical intervention, or otherwise -- may be different for different people.<p>> Daily recommended calorie intake averages ~2000 calories.<p>That&#x27;s the standard used for the bases for percentages of daily recommended intake of various nutrients in FDA-mandated labels, for a variety of reasons [0], but its not actually the average recommendation for maintenance intake. [1]<p>> I was going over that by ~1000 per day before adjusting my habits, and I don&#x27;t think I was unusual.<p>So, you were eating about maintenance level for a young adult male, but probably living a sedentary lifestyle.

Things are wonderful then multiple semantic models can be used in tandem.<p>But while I&#x27;d like to argue for the value of cost models, at this point I&#x27;d like to also fight for the value-based ones.<p>Totality is important not because it has a practical effect. I vehemently agree with how you are arguing here to that end.<p>It&#x27;s instead important because in formal systems which ignore it you <i>completely</i> lose the notion of time. Inclusion of non-termination and handling for it admits that there is <i>at least one way</i> which we are absolutely unjustified in ignoring the passage of time: if we accidentally write something that literally will never finish.<p>It is absolutely a shallow way of viewing things. You&#x27;re absolutely right to say that practical termination is more important that black-and-white non-termination.<p>But that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s brought up.

That&#x27;s a fringe theory at best, that might be applicable to something like &quot;Mainstream Buddhism&quot;. (e.g. what you see in a yoga magazine in the grocery store)<p>There&#x27;s quite an established corpus of Tibetan texts and monastic curriculum that has existed for the past 1000 or so years (depending on the tradition) that involve primary sources (Sanskrit Indian texts dating from 100 AD or so onwards) and developed commentary in Tibetan. It&#x27;s of primary importance for every Monastery / center to have a full set of Kangyur (sutra) and Tengyur (tantra), with many of the most revered and most studied texts coming from 1300 AD or so in Ancient Tibetan, and as far back as 100 AD (Sanskrit and Tibetan translations of Sanskrit).<p>There is meticulous textual preservation practiced at all major Tibetan monasteries, and many have preserved texts throughout the Cultural revolution that have been confirmed by other discoveries of identical copies and translations in China, India, Ceylon, and Southeast Asia.<p>That&#x27;s an extremely odd theory, as well, because Tibetan literally has two different forms: Modern and Ancient, and texts can be dated by their use of language, similar to Modern and Ancient Chinese, and anyone who denies that is basically equivalent of thinking fossils were buried by the Jews or the earth is 5000 years old or something equally non-factual.<p>It&#x27;s certainly reasonable to say that there are &quot;Buddhisms&quot;--there were many different interpretations of primary sources in different Asian regions that continued to develop independently of each other (and merged with local custom or ritual), but it&#x27;s somewhat ludicrous to say that there was &quot;no core set of ideas&quot; that was being actively practiced in Asia 150 years ago within specific traditions, or that what is currently practiced in Asia is &quot;Western&quot; at its core. You can even make a strong argument that there are a few core principles that are consistent across all branches of &quot;Buddhism&quot; that have little to do with Western ideas or Western religion, namely lack of self, and the composed nature of all phenomena, which have their roots in the very earliest texts, with constant development and reinforcement from ~100AD forward.<p>source: Master&#x27;s in Religious Studies, specifically Tibetan Buddhism",1449170791

During starvation this metabolic state is a kindness of nature allowing the victim to suffer much reduced pains of hunger while dying. During illness the suppression of the appetite frees the person to rest and recuperate, rather then be forced by hunger to gather and prepare food. Because ketogenic diets simulate this metabolic state seen with serious illness, I refer to them as “the make yourself sick diets.” As we will see below, another reason low-carbohydrate, high-protein diets deserve this title is they contain significant amounts of the very foods — the meats — that the American Cancer Society and the Heart Association tell us contribute to our most common causes of death and disability.<p><a href=""https://www.drmcdougall.com/health/education/health-science/featured-articles/articles/high-protein-diets/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.drmcdougall.com/health/education/health-science/...</a><p>> A plant-based diet beat out the conventional American Diabetes Association diet in a head-to-head randomized controlled clinical trial, without restricting portions, no calorie or carb counting.

He and Coombes say they found errors in the 2006 paper, including genes that didn’t seem to belong on the list and tumor samples that were incorrectly labeled.\n[...]\nBut Potti and Nevins continued to publish papers using the same method. This troubled Baggerly. He became obsessed with determining why the Duke team could make their prediction models work when he and Coombes could not.In subsequent papers by the Duke group, Baggerly says he found new errors and contacted both Lancet Oncology and the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO), where they had appeared. Both declined to publish Baggerly’s letters\n[...]\nBaggerly then learned that Duke was running three clinical trials using the Potti- Nevins approach to assign patients to treatment. He took a new tack: publishing a paper of his own. He and Coombes shared their critique of several papers published by Potti and Nevins with a “prominent” biological journal, he says, whose editors suggested that the paper was too negative. &quot;\n<a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org.edu/content/329/5992/614"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org.edu/content/329/5992/614</a>",1449170131

To me, a programming language is a system of rules of inference, whose judgments are of the form “program is well-formed” (which covers syntax and type checking) and “program does this at runtime” (a reduction relation, a predicate transformer semantics, or whatever fits your language&#x27;s dynamics best). Then, simplicity is just some measure of the language&#x27;s size as a collection of rules of inference. Also:<p>0. Undecidable rules of inference (e.g., type reconstruction for a Curry-style System F-omega) are considered cheating. Undefined behavior (e.g., C and C++) is also considered cheating. Cheating is penalized by considering the entire language infinitely complex.<p>1. Languages (e.g., ML&#x27;s module system) are allowed to be defined by elaboration into other languages (e.g., System F-omega). Elaboration into a language that cheats is considered cheating, though.<p>> To handle this, I think of &quot;unwieldy&quot; as a bit of a technical term. What does it mean to be unwieldy? It means that there is significant non-ignorable complexity.<p>I don&#x27;t see any complexity as ignorable at all. I just see some complexity as worth the price - but you, the programmer, need to be aware that you&#x27;re paying a price. For instance, the ease with which one can reason about Haskell programs (without the totally crazy GHC extensions) justifies the increased complexity w.r.t., say, Scheme.<p>> Significant here must be defined almost probabilistically, too. If there is significant complexity which is ignorable across 99/100 real-world uses of a language then it really should win some significant points.<p>This is ease of use, which is subject to statistical analysis; not simplicity, which is not.",1449169859

Even if you want to argue that it was already great when he got (back) there, it&#x27;s still to his credit that he built the company around making such good use of it.  If you want to blame CEOs for everything that goes wrong with a company, you pretty much have to give them credit for everything that goes right, too.  Normally I don&#x27;t think CEOs are nearly that important either way, but in this case it&#x27;s fair to give Jobs a lot of the credit, precisely because Apple&#x27;s brand marketing was so effective and the company positioned itself and its products around that brand as well as it did.<p>That&#x27;s exactly what Microsoft, and especially Ballmer, never did.  As the author points out, maybe Steve Jobs crashing your party would make the other guests feel less cool, but the reality is that a lot of people want to be hangers-on and aren&#x27;t sufficiently introspective to feel uncool about it.  The completion of the analogy is that Jobs got a lot of your guests to pay him $300 for the privilege of following him to crash the next party, while Ballmer brought $20 worth of bad vodka, then robbed your apartment while you were passed out.  They both made money without creating much value; the difference is at whose expense they did so.",1449169454

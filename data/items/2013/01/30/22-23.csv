Being sarcastic or downright rude results in the person on the other end making a complaint to your boss, resulting in you getting an e-mail firing you when the call ends.<p>Amusingly, I'm not actually sure whether it's possible to finish the game while both managing to make the change the user wants and not getting fired.  I think the best ending I've got so far was the caller failing to make it past all the security checks, and having to drop the call.<p>The game does not use any real recorded voices and it doesn't particularly make fun of callers.  Just the caller is somewhat quick to anger and doesn't know the answer to any questions, really.<p>This is a massive overreaction by the minister, who obviously hasn't played the game either.",1359586798

There are a lot of repeated sequences in biology and many of them are slightly different than each other. For example, we need to insert ""difference"" and ""different"" in the structure. The suffix trie would have shared nodes while the suffix array needs an entry for each suffix.<p>2. Mutations are how evolution takes action. Biologically, in sequences, mutations are just misspellings. If you're looking for a sequence with arbitrary misspellings at position i, a tree structure is easier and faster to traverse.<p>But in reality, most indexing, especially in DNA, uses BWT [1] for indexing.

We treat it as an enforceable demand.""<p>Maybe so, but it is also technically trespassing to cross railroad tracks outside of designated grade-level crossings.  In my town, there was a brief period where the police attempted to enforce that, and it was found to be absurd and counter-productive to do so:  people from every level of society walk across the tracks without hesitation, without thinking about the misdemeanor offense they are committing, and often in plain view of the police.  In almost all cases, they are causing no damage to anyone, and so the police do not care -- it benefits nobody to mindlessly arrest everyone who technically violates some law.<p>""JSTOR at the very least has a moral right to control how he used their private service to download the articles.""<p>Sure, because they own their computers; they are free to restrict access, disconnect from the Internet, or encrypt everything without releasing the keys, and that is fine.  They chose not to do so, so why should we care if they do not like the particular program Aaron used, or his particular plans for the documents he downloaded?<p>""I think most people believe that creators are entitled to control the distribution of their work.""<p>I doubt that; outside of one person who works for the music industry yet to meet anyone who shows even one millisecond of hesitation when it comes to sharing copies of photos, music, movies, written documents,  or any other creative work.  Most people are perfectly willing to sing ""Happy Birthday to You"" in public, without spending any mental effort on the idea that it is copyrighted or that the copyright holder forbids public performances.<p>The only moral issues people have with copyright infringement are when (a) artists are ""ripped off"" by it (but that is usually something the copyright holders are doing, and is irrelevant to Aaron's case anyway) or (b) when someone claims credit for work they did not do (equally irrelevant here).  Copyright as a system has nothing to do with either of these:  artists and creative people are routinely ""ripped off"" without any copyright violation occurring, and copyright does not require attribution (and creative people are often not credited for their work under the copyright system).  It has nothing to do with morals, it is a legal framework for promoting businesses that were important to society <i>in the 18th century</i>.  It is as morally relevant to most people as a bill meant to promote the laying of fiber optic lines to built Internet infrastructure.<p>""People think (and I'd argue rightfully so), that downloading a movie should warrant the kind of slap on the wrist""<p>No they don't; most people think downloading a movie is fine because they want to watch it, and that it is just the fat cats in Hollywood who would care about stopping them.

When we originally did the project, I engineered for long-term sustainability.<p>I picked Java because even then it was obvious that Java was the new COBOL. Which had its drawbacks, but that meant high stability and longevity.<p>I avoided complex dependencies; it ran by keeping all data in a single process and writing everything out to a set of XML docs on a filesystem. There the bet was that Moore's Law would progress faster than the data set size or the usage volume; that turned out to be true. The only real dependencies were on the core Java and Java Servlet stuff, plus an XML library.<p>That simple architecture made it relatively sysadmin-friendly. Data was backed up by a simple script that just checked everything into CVS every 15 minutes. When they needed to move it to a new machine there was just setting up a standard Tomcat container, dumping in the WAR, and pointing it at the data. So there was never any significant downtime.<p>I also wrote a bunch of unit tests, so that in theory it would be easy for another developer to pick up. Only a couple of other devs worked on it, though, so it's hard to say how much that helped. But I was really happy to have the tests a few years later when we reved it.<p>Eventually it got rewritten in whatever their in-house dev was using so it could be more integrated with the existing accounts. The original code base lasted a decade or so, though, so I'm satisfied with how most of the initial choices worked out.",1359584274

MIT's network is designed to be open; a ban on a MAC address is, on such a network, little more than a polite request to not continue your access.<p>MIT's network is a private network and they have complete authority over who gets to access it, in a legal sense and a moral sense. It's their prerogative to extend access to anyone except specifically chosen people. In our society, we do not treat ""get off our lawn"" and the equivalent as a ""polite request."" We treat it as an enforceable demand.<p>> How conservative of you.<p>Yes. We live in a society of rules and borders and boundaries.

I think most people believe that creators are entitled to control the distribution of their work. I think the prevailing mindset is that a digital creation should not be treated differently, for ownership purposes, than a physical creation. Do people download anyway? Sure. But people also sneak into movie theaters. That doesn't mean they feel that theater owners don't have a moral right to exclude non-paying viewers.<p>To the extent that I think the law is out of step with the modern sense of justice is proportionality. People think (and I'd argue rightfully so), that downloading a movie should warrant the kind of slap on the wrist (if anything) that sneaking into the theater to watch that movie would warrant. Not huge dollar fines and possible jail time.<p>Swartz's case really boils down to that: the trespassing charge was dropped, while the charge for accessing the network was not. He was trespassing, and he was accessing the network illegally, but if one was minor enough to be dropped the other should have been treated similarly.",1359584115

I haven't used source control integration with VS2010 or VS2012. Sometimes, when I find something to suck, I still revisit it every now and again, just in case it's since improved. The Visual Studio source control integration experience was just so reliably, hellishly awful that I never saw the need.<p>(The experience could well be better if you have a distributed system. Much of the plugins' flakiness seemed to be come from having to talk to a server (downtime or network connectivity problems always caused issues), and from the maintenance of accurate check in/check out information - both non-issues with a distributed system.)",1359583609

But maybe someday some expert will come along and fix things.<p>If you actually read the rubygems documentation on signing gems, it's pretty much ""Okay generate your own self-signed key, then sign it with your self-signed key.""  That leaves a lot to be desired vs best practices.  There isn't even an attempt to describe how you get your self-signed keys to users.<p>I just think leveraging the existing OpenPGP semantics, ecosystem, and battle-hardened gnupg codebase, is a lot easier than implementing an entire system from scratch on X.509 just because openssl is already installed everywhere and ruby has better bindings and gnupg is not and does not.<p>I'm just trying to take the approach you usually preach: Don't roll your own crypto code and leave the real work to the pros, and it seems like gpg offers a lower path of resistance.",1359583562

Now Indian reservations manufacture their own untaxed cigarettes - which is completely legal, when bought and smoked on the reservation.

Many of these brands <i>are</i> social or curation-based (Gruber, Techmeme, the swell of e-mail newsletters, Hacker News even) but full on personalization has failed (and, IMHO, will continue to fail) to take off at the publication level.<p>It's not as if we've lacked for algorithms, news sources, or the technology to do this, and both companies and people have kept coming along with the personalization promise. While it appeals to my geekier side, I'm starting to think these promises are just sales pitches from people with algorithms to sell rather than a solid grip on both the media and what readers actually want.<p>Like RSS, a certain audience - mostly the more technically inclined - will stick with it, but I don't see a big swing into all-personalization-all-the-time working out long term in the mass market.

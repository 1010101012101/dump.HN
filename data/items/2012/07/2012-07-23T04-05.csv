In other words, one for each integer.  Further, every function on the circle can be expressed as a sum of the sine waves.  That sum is called the spectral decomposition.  (This is Fourier series.)<p>With clever choices of functions, you can get some profound results.  For example, picking a saw-tooth wave and doing the spectral decomposition gives the identity<p>1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + ... = pi^2/6<p>And, by the way, the left hand side is the zeta function evaluated at 2.<p>And about functions that are zero at each composite... You may want to check out Dirichlet characters.  They are periodic functions which behave nicely under multiplication.  Whenever an integer and the period have a common factor, the character will be zero at that integer.<p>It's not going to be zero at all composites, but it's on the right track.",1343019427

It's still an insane amount of money.<p>- Bankruptcies in Germany and Spain by solar companies are very much the cause of bad policies - by pumping up a sector with unsustainable subsidies, then being forced to remove subsidies precisely because they are unsustainable.  This creates a bubble into which resources rush, which then bursts and creates a lot of problems.<p>This is the fundamental problem, of trying to coerce a particular set of technologies into place when they aren't suitable for it.  The correct response is to admit there is no current technical solution to affordable energy without burning stuff.

What does it protect against, and what makes it better than not having that right?""<p>It can be seen as a right to self defense.<p>First, consider that your life, or at least your quality of life, depends on the police doing their jobs. To destroy you, the police merely need to make it known that you won't be protected.<p>There are many examples of this for many different reasons. It could be some political reason why the police chief doesn't want to enforce order in a minority neighborhood. Or, it could be more personal.<p>Even if the police do make a reasonable effort to protect you, it might not be enough to deter a stalker or someone that you're afraid of. Police generally react after the fact to punish a perpetrator rather than actually protect you, anyway.<p>You seem to be turning the burden of proof around, to ask why I think we should be allowed a freedom. The social contract says otherwise: we must agree together that a freedom is so dangerous that it should be outlawed.<p>Honestly, I think you should carefully evaluate whether you think that we are really better off with severe restrictions on guns[1], or whether you are just reacting emotionally to the thought that someone on your block owns a killing machine (which is what guns are, really).<p>But there are 200M+ guns in the US (numbers aren't precise, but it's about 2 guns per 3 people -- men, women, and children), and we aren't dropping like flies, so you have to look past the emotion. Most gun deaths in the US are suicide, by the way[2] -- and some people argue that is a human right.<p>[1] The research is mixed on the subject, and I imagine it depends on a lot of factors. To really have an opinion that the right should be removed, you would need to put in a lot of serious effort to research the numbers and convince yourself that people actually would be saved. I have the advantage that I win by default -- I don't need to prove that gun ownership increases safety to hold my opinion, I just need to convince myself that it doesn't increase danger enough to justify restricting it (which is pretty easy considering the low number of gun homicides overall).<p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_Stat...</a>",1343017372

I'm not sure what it is globally, but in the US it's several percent (which is not zero percent under any rounding I'm aware of). More to the point, it produces more than 10% of the electricity in five U.S. states. It's also the fastest-growing energy source in the world, even faster than natural gas.<p>> Trillions of dollars have been spent on windfarms and solar panels around the world, and, as the article notes, it has made zero difference to the overall energy mix.<p>Nowhere near ""trillions of dollars"" have been spent on wind farms. You're just making things up.<p>> Yet it has affected national economies in real ways - the bankruptcies in Germany, Spain and elsewhere have real costs, as does taking the most basic economic input - energy - and making it more expensive for zero environmental gain at the global level.<p>The bankruptcies in Germany, Spain, etc, are the fault of alternative energy?<p>> Despite the countless examples of failures to point to, the boosters insist that it's the right course, when any plain analysis shows the exact opposite.<p>The analysis of the ""skeptics"" almost always leaves out the vast externalized costs of traditional energy sources. E.g. if hundreds of billions of dollars of externalized costs from coal were factored into the price of coal, coal power would be more expensive than wind power: <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dave-cooper/harvard-study-coal-costs-_b_831755.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dave-cooper/harvard-study-coal...</a>.<p>> But you have to be a starry-eyed believer who trusts in state-coerced solutions<p>There is nothing starry-eyed about the economists who point out that the free market naturally underproduces fundamental R&D.

4279480,comment,4276916,4278456,1,0,vacri,,,"After the Port Arthur massacre here in Australia, firearm laws were tightened, and an amnesty program was put in place for people to drop off weapons. Police were surprised at how enthusiastically the public took up the offer. I don't think this would translate as well in the US due to the 'cold-dead-hands' mentality of a few, but I think you'd find more people willing to give up their arms than you might expect.<p><i>a non-negligible percentage of the population carries concealed firearms wherever they go, then it's harder for mass tragedies to occur</i><p>The problem is that mass killings are a drop in the bucket. This guy killed 12 people (and maimed 50), and in a bad year you might have half a dozen of them. Say 60 dead to this kind of thing. But the US has 17000 homicides per year. Basing your legal response on spree killings is very much the wrong thing to do.<p>Given that most murders are crimes of passion done in the heat of the moment, you're going to cause more deaths by intentionally arming the population than saving lives by having a mass shooter killed after the first few victims.<p>Also, 'concealed carry' is not a magic bullet. Washington state went concealed carry in 1961, yet its crime rates rose and fell in step with its colleagues. Concealed carry arguments always relies on anecdotal arguments and never statistics, I find. The one stat that does get mentioned is crime rate, but there's rarely any mention of other factors (like rising incarceration rates)<p>Anyway, a simple counter to your armed robbery example - the robber almost always has the drop on you. Most people would rather give up the cash rather than risk the robber actually shooting you while you or a bystander start a mexican standoff.<p><i>the worst thing that will happen is you get three squares a day and a roof over your head at taxpayer expense</i><p>Really, we need to stop painting prison as a kind of holiday resort.

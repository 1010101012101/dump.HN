He/she is pointing out a logical fallacy in the App Review rules.<p>Developers are allowed access to something called an &quot;advertising identifier&quot; which lets them track users between apps, for the purposes of targeted advertising. Apple is very restrictive in terms of user identification, in order to protect users&#x27; privacy, so this is the only way to uniquely identify a user/device, and the user can optionally opt-out of the advertising identifier entirely.<p>Apple doesn&#x27;t want developers to use the advertising identifier for things other than advertising. But the way they enforce this is simply by requiring that an app include ads in order to use the advertising identifier. If you use the advertising identifier and your app doesn&#x27;t visibly include ads, it will be rejected.<p>This restriction is ostensibly intended to prevent developers from abusing the advertising identifier, but really it just encourages developers to include shitty ads in their apps, because if you include ads, you can use the advertising identifier for whatever you want behind the scenes.

I keep watching for solar thermal plants to take off.<p><i>> It&#x27;s the controlled fission of a super critical amount of enriched uranium.</i><p>No, it&#x27;s the controlled fission of a <i>critical</i> amount of enriched uranium. Supercritical means the reaction is not controlled--that&#x27;s a bomb, not a reactor.<p>As far as operating &quot;on the edge of danger&quot;, that depends on how the reaction responds to various changes in conditions, particularly those caused by failures in other parts of the plant. The key is that you want reactivity to go down in response to a failure condition (i.e., you want the reactor to become subcritical, so the chain reaction dies out). Early on, we did not know how to design reactors that had this property under all failure conditions; but now we do, and we have for quite some time (and, as I noted in an earlier post, nobody since the Soviet Union has been insane enough <i>not</i> to make use of that knowledge when designing a reactor).<p>The problem with the Fukushima reactor was something different: decay heat removal, i.e., once the reactor shuts down, you still have fission products inside the core that are producing heat because they&#x27;re highly radioactive. At the time the Fukushima reactor was built, we did not know how to design a reactor that could remove that decay heat in a controlled fashion without backup electrical power available. Now we do know how to do that; in fact there are at least two different ways to do it (either design the cooling system to operate using natural convection, or redesign the reactor core so that fission products can be removed and reprocessed while the reactor is operating).<p>So while I&#x27;ll agree that early reactors were more like motorcycles, recent reactor designs are more like family sedans, with all kinds of safety features that protect the driver even from his own mistakes. (The Fukushima and Three Mile Island designs were somewhere in between.)<p><i>> People are the weak link</i><p>Agreed; we humans are almost always the least reliable component of any system that includes us.<p><i>> and we&#x27;re pretty much intrinsic to the process.</i><p>Not necessarily; it&#x27;s often possible to design passive safety features (i.e., ones that work automatically without human intervention), and in systems where reliability is paramount, this should be done whenever possible.",1409537326

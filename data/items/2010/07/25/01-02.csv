You're providing too many knobs and dials at each step in a workflow (see the TED talk[1]; solving this is basically where UX design and game design merge into one field),<p>2. Or there is a certain minimum level of strategic thought required for your business process, and you've removed all the ""ruminance gaps"" that allow users to have those strategic thoughts while believing that they are working. Instead, they have to just sit there and look unproductive while they ruminate, which creates stress. (You can also cynically call this the ""users don't really want to do their jobs, so the more bureaucracy, the better"" problem—but it still applies even to the most dedicated workers.)<p>You can solve the first problem with a re-design, but the second problem is actually a social one, related to how people are perceived, and how they perceive themselves, while working, and needs to be solved at the company-policy level.<p>As for easter eggs—I would say that it isn't your job to entertain your employees. You shouldn't be paid for releasing features which don't contribute to overall productivity (though, of course, you can do it anyway, on off hours; and keep in mind that increased morale has the same sort of effect on productivity that advertising has on brand-building.)

Once I understand the problem to that level of detail, I can generally write the code faster than I could explain it to somebody else. Of course, I use terse and expressive programming languages.<p>Don Knuth's title is ""Professor Emeritus of the Art of Computer Programming"". If ""programmer"" is good enough for Knuth, then after two decades of writing software, I aspire to be worthy of the title.",1280019785

Similarly, there was one recent feature I was involved in that was universally lauded as being a fun little easter egg, yet wasted several million hours of productivity worldwide.  It's an interesting balancing act between giving people what they <i>want</i> and giving them what they <i>need</i>, and while we tend to err on the side of giving them what they need, it can sometimes be hard to do so when they hate us for it.",1280019676

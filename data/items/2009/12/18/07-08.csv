Because the buyers at Etsy generally only purchase when they have a reasonable certainty that the item will be produced by the original artisan, by hand.<p>It is very much a Catch-22.",1261122981
1002763,comment,1002137,1002137,0,0,andrew1,,,"It's a little off topic, but I'm intrigued by the '87% of Americans can be uniquely identified by DOB, gender and zip code'. Given the size of the US's population and the relative scarcity of zip codes, this seems an incredible claim. The link in the article is broken so I can't read the paper. Even just thinking about the big cities, where I imagine virtually no one would be identifiable, that figure sounds impossibly high. Maybe the figure actually refers to just working adults or something like that. Does anyone have any more information about this, or access to the original paper?",1261122856

We'll attend to learn skills, which is part of what the article says:<p>""In future, those who stump up will do so because they want to learn the skills, not because they think they are buying entry into a cool and exclusive club""<p>B-school is what you make of it. You get a couple years to soak up a ton of knowledge. Sure there's always BS but there are some incredibly powerful models that you just won't learn outside of it unless you're <i>very</i> dedicated. HR? As primarily a developer, I'm not going to read an HR textbook unless someone tests me on it. Turns out it's a very interesting subject and links strongly to your strategy. Same with marketing, finance, etc etc.<p>You can also attend, get through the exams and have the primary output being a piece of paper - same as any other degree.",1261122205

1002744,comment,1001711,1001711,0,0,aohtsab,,,"Six weeks passed this prior semester before I realized I was going to fail all of my classes. Was I focused? Absolutely not.<p>This past semester I switched into Engineering from a Liberal Arts degree, and I'd never felt so worthless, incompetent and overwhelmed. Everyone had it together, everyone knew absolutely everything—and me, half a year of teaching myself programming in my spare time was showing no results. Except for developing carpal tunnel syndrome.<p>My roommate was another source of tension. Every day (and I really mean every day), he would talk about how Harvard Law demanded a 4.0, who wore real suits and who wore knock-offs, how School A was so much better than School B, the difference in salary between top-tier and bottom-tier grads, and, to top it off, how much he valued ""good ol' American values, like from the 50s"".<p>He flew through his tests and quizzes with straight-As, and I struggled to scrape up a passing grade.<p>To make matters worse, I started learning shell scripting, further distracting me from homework and classes. Also, I was getting treated for depression.<p>Anyway, I couldn't find a way to be motivated for anything other than my side projects. I tried turning my homework into a programming puzzle, but it was too late—my grades were too low to salvage.<p>Taking time off was something that had always been on my mind, but hearing it recommended was the final push I needed.<p>So I withdrew.<p>And, surprisingly, the world didn't end—it opened up. I didn't know what to do with all this free time, so I increased my volunteering time at a local school and started job-applying like crazy.<p>I was interviewed for an IT position and another to cashier, and I got neither. Still don't have a job, still wondering how I'm going to feed my cat, yet not worried.<p>Don't get me wrong—I'm stressed like hell, but I'm enjoying it. I can literally spend hours coding without feeling guilty.<p>Finishing college is important to me, however, and I'm set to return in the fall.<p>Hopefully my work ethic will keep maturing—I'm excited to start again.<p>GPA definitely isn't on my mind.",1261120890
1002743,comment,1002227,1002251,0,0,pvg,,,"That sounds somewhat overwrought. You can get much more and higher quality data on 'the disposition and tactics of US forces' from satellites, traffic analysis, reading the official sites of US military units and soldier's blogs than you can from terabytes of narrow-field grainy footage of the Hindu Kush or Sadr city. It might be of some tactical use to someone engaged in 'asymmetrical warfare' against US forces and is probably even more useful as a propaganda tool. The intelligence-gathering operations of other countries probably have more storage space dedicated to episodes of The Simpsons than intercepted US UAV video.",1261120870

1901231,comment,1901022,1901022,0,0,cscotta,,,"I've read through this post a few times and am having some difficulty understanding both the original problem and the solution that Greg is suggesting.<p>From what I can gather, it seems that Netflix's product development team is frustrated to find that there is no integrated support for DRM'd media streams provided by the OS. From here, he jumps to the conclusion that the best approach is working with <i>individual handset manufacturers</i> to patch in support for this at the OS or kernel level. This is difficult to understand.<p>It's an operating system. You build things on top of it. One does not go to every PC manufacturer to add a ""feature"" to one.<p>Spectres of ""fragmentation"" aside, let's remember that these phones are real computers running a real Linux-based OS that run real software, written in real programming languages like C, Java, and Scala. They also have support for encrypted transports like SSL and high-quality video codecs like H.264. Heck, Adobe's even done it - secure content streaming on Android is possible, and works fine (speaking strictly of the transport and decoding layer - leave it to the bloggeurs to hash over what happens when you paint content on a screen).<p>These facts suggest that implementing secure DRM'd video streams and a player for them is not only possible, but much easier than working directly with two of the most backward-facing industries in technology now (film studios and mobile phone providers) to add this functionality.",1289670867
1901230,comment,1901022,1901097,0,0,bigmac,,,"There are certain specs that anyone implementing a video streaming/content delivery service must comply with.  The studios mandate that certain specs be followed, and an engineer has to sign off that they've implemented the DRM spec correctly.  For an example, look at DTCP-IP (<a href=""http://www.dtcp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dtcp.com/</a>)<p>The specs mandate usage of certain types of encryption algorithms, key lengths, key expirations, etc.  All the data that is sent over the wire is encrypted, so that no one using a packet sniffer can trivially obtain the unencrypted video.  Thus, from the point of view of the attacker, the problem becomes extracting the encryption keys from the software and using that to decrypt the sniffed traffic.<p>Every device/software module ends up having a some root key that must be seriously obfuscated, because that key provides the security for the entire system.  It must be embedded in the software or hardware.  If its in hardware the problem is easier, because it cannot be disassembled and discovered as readily.  In software, the problem is more challenging.  Some form of White-Box Cryptography has to be used.<p>So, a secure flash player or a native app is only the first step in the solution.  The whole key management system has to be built or provided by a 3rd party library.  Google doesn't have such a library built in to Android.  After you have the library, all kinds of nasty tricks have to be used on the library itself.  Generally, the goal is to prevent debugging and code modification.  The tactics used are very similar to what malware authors use to protect their malware from reverse engineering.",1289670860

It's not hard to imagine someone acquiring virtual real estate at very high prices. Certainly I know of many investors doing it to the tune of tens of thousands. Just like landlords, those buyers are regaining their money by renting out portions of it to tenants, virtual good shopkeepers, special in-game events, etc. This is absolutely without question happening right now in many virtual settings and has been for years.<p>As such, virtual land can be a true investment, regardless of the number of ""pixels"" it contains. I'm not saying I think it's a <i>good</i> investment, but to dismiss the market entirely as worthless is a narrow-sighted decision without understanding that there are true economic forces at work, and that business-people do their math and seem quite willing to make large payments they expect to recoup (just as with real property).<p>Further, some could have said the same quote about websites and look foolish today:<p>> no one is paying $500k for a fucking virtual magazine made out of pixels and stored on a Wordpress server.<p>> no one is paying $500k for a fucking virtual name stored on a DNS server.<p>Virtual and digital items are going to be more and more important in our lives. They will continue to be valuable. Bet on it.<p>Even beyond the business implications, the comment and reaction surprises me. I don't see people reacting with the same shock about buying a $500,000 work of art, memorabilia, or antique. Clearly things can be of exceptional value based on the amount of time involved in creating it, the amount of sentimental value it holds, or the level of beauty/quality it has.<p>It's entirely fair to think high-priced virtual goods are a bad investment or to be skeptical of their worth, but to be severely dismissive of them is an act of ignorance and not giving them the (small?) respect they deserve simply as an economic factor in our lives and our children's lives.",1289669231

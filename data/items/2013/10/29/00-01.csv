If other people happen to share your sentiment, awesome.

Bad managers will be bad.<p>The reason I&#x27;m interested in Peak is that it may be a good tool to implement the &quot;trust, but verify&quot; approach to management. I feel like I under-manage my team (7 people) because I really dislike interrupting people. I generally assume everybody is doing something productive, and understands the goals and priorities of our products.<p>However, when a team member gets stuck or goes off into the weeds, they may not realize it themselves. Before they&#x27;ve spent a days doing unnecessary work or spinning their wheels, it would be great to have a non-interrupting way to notice this and give them the support they need to get back on track.<p>Of course you need to take the numbers for what they are - if you directly incentivize people to get their dropbox files changed numbers up, you&#x27;re gonna have a bad time. Still, I see this as a potential tool to help me understand what might be going right and wrong with my team without bugging them, and that&#x27;s a good thing.",1383008289

This trial week seems to discriminate against those who cannot trivially sacrifice vacation time (employees with families, for example). There are others, too; I&#x27;ve heard other founders scheduling interviews with candidates late into the evening or night, even on weekends.

6631047,story,,,1,2,rubycowgames,"Ask HN: Help validate this idea",,"Idea: Starfall.com for the iPad generation<p>Problem: Kids will learn on mobile devices. Nothing currently exists as an educational &quot;one stop shop&quot;. Parents need a brand to trust.<p>Solution: Educational app system for tablets. Progression based on a child&#x27;s mastery.<p>As a parent of a young child (he is 2 years old) - I&#x27;m constantly searching for new things to help my child develop. He&#x27;s learned a ton from traditional physical toys/books and I spend a ton of time playing with him. I know he&#x27;s benefiting from this interaction.<p>At the same time, he&#x27;s exposed to many digital devices (my iphone, ipad, tv, etc). Digital devices are the norm for him. If we skip forward a decade, I imagine that most kids would be learning primarily from mobile devices.<p>There are indie educational apps - things that teach individual learning skills like the alphabet, sounds, or colors. These separate apps when combined together could make up a &quot;cohesive&quot; learning set that provides effective learning progression. But that requires a parent to pick the individual apps and gauge when their child is ready for the next app. Also you have the problem of varying app quality.<p>The other option is a web learning system, like Starfall.com. This is well received and recommended by parents/educators - but they are designed for computer use. Kids interact through a mouse and keyboard. But newer generation kids grow up on touch based interfaces. I know when my kid plays with my computer, he&#x27;s always trying to touch the screen.<p>I would pay a small subscription ($3-7/month) for something like a khanacademy app for preschoolers. So I figure why not try to make it myself. I&#x27;ve asked friends (who are parents) and they&#x27;ve all said they would buy a sub after they&#x27;ve seen the product.

Hell, I&#x27;m finding a lot of apps aren&#x27;t.\n- How I haven&#x27;t missed the registry... uninstalling an app, doesn&#x27;t really mean its uninstalled, there&#x27;s still reminisce of the app lying around.\n- If you connect your device to skydrive, you have to use the same password you use online to login. WTF? The best part, there&#x27;s a character limit restriction on the password so you can&#x27;t even have a complicated one, but why would you? You wouldn&#x27;t remember it. (Yes there is a pin option to unlock the device, but at times you have to put in your full password).\n- The UI is not intuitive at all. I gave the device to my friend who primarily uses Windows and he had a hard time with the metro UI.\n- I rarely find myself using the tablet mode. I almost wish I could disable it... apps by default actually open in the tablet mode... Double click an image, hey it swaps over to the tablet mode. Great...\n- This sucker attracts fingerprints like no other.... my MBA still looks pristine after 1.5 years... where as I&#x27;ve already gotten three or four light scratches on the Surface by merely placing the device on my table...<p>Despite all the shortcomings, I have to say, I&#x27;m still loving the Surface.

Most people who hold statistics degrees are fairly lousy engineers[0], and I don&#x27;t know of any other term that (concisely) expresses that I&#x27;m equally competent as a statistician and a (backend) engineer[1].<p>Of course, this is because many of these programs haven&#x27;t yet caught up to the fact that computers exist and are still teaching statistics as if we&#x27;re in a pre-computation era. The perfect solution is to fix this, and thereby fix the connotation of the word &quot;statistician&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s the same reason I dislike the term &quot;growth hacker&quot; - really, that&#x27;s just the way marketing <i>should</i> be done (ie, based on numbers and verifiable statistics). In a perfect world, all (competent) marketers would be &quot;growth hackers&quot;. But many marketers aren&#x27;t, and so we have to make up another cringe-worthy term for it.<p>Unfortunately, that&#x27;s a problem that&#x27;s beyond my means to solve.

Weebly seems to be doing it right-- 66% hire rate, not a competition, everything paid-for, etc.-- but I&#x27;d be worried if this caught on. What if companies start instituting 2-month trial periods at submarket rates, and what if that becomes the norm? What if hiring rates of 20% (comparable to in-office interviews, but harmful when contiguous periods are required and vacation time, instead of stray sick days for interviews, must be used)? What if companies delay reimbursement for months, exacerbating the disadvantage of a protracted job search? Or, what if companies use the trial week period not to evaluate work, but for unethical purposes such as doing the sketchier reference checks (e.g. back-channel) that savvy job seekers prevent by using (or faking) time pressure from competing offers? Speaking of which, exactly how <i>is</i> this going to interplay with the (presumably ongoing) job search of the candidate, and the likelihood of offers coming in with tight timeframes? Do people get to move around their trial days to take other interviews? They should have that right.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting idea, but I can see it going in a really bad direction.",1383005447

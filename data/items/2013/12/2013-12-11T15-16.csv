Before Obama was president, his phone was tapped.<p>2. He must have said, or been party to, some incriminating things, because that happens to basically everyone.<p>3. Therefore, he could be blackmailed.<p>4. Therefore, he has been blackmailed.<p>5. Therefore, he is now doing exactly what whoever blackmailed him wants.<p>I have no trouble believing #1.<p>#2 is doubtless true for some senses of &quot;incriminating&quot;. I think he admitted (it&#x27;s ridiculous for this to be an <i>admission</i>, but never mind) that he smoked some cannabis as a student. He went to a church whose leader said some kinda dumb things. He must surely have said some kinda dumb things. But ... the subset of these &quot;incriminating&quot; things that got out during his election campaign wasn&#x27;t enough to lose him the primary or the presidential election. There&#x27;d need to be something quite a lot worse to provide enough blackmail material to (e.g.) kick him out of the job or put him in prison. Richlieu notwithstanding, six randomly chosen lines do not generally suffice to hang someone in the present-day USA.<p>Now, of course it&#x27;s possible that he really did do something bad enough to provide real blackmail leverage. But I wouldn&#x27;t want to bet on it.<p>#3 might follow if #2 were right for a sufficiently serious sense of &quot;incriminating&quot;. But (see above) I don&#x27;t think it is.<p>#4 wouldn&#x27;t follow from #3 in any case. It does, astonishingly, sometimes happen that people who could be blackmailed aren&#x27;t. Blackmail is a high-risk strategy; if you try it and your victim isn&#x27;t playing, it can get awfully embarrassing for the would-be blackmailer. And it&#x27;s not as if the <i>President of the United States of America</i> lacks the resources to make things difficult for someone trying to blackmail him.<p>(He might lack the resources if he were somehow being blackmailed by the entirety of his staff, or an all-powerful conspiracy that could frustrate everything he might try to do to expose them. But that would require a size and scale of conspiracy that (a) is improbable <i>a priori</i>, (b) is more improbable given that no insider has ever felt guilty enough to blow it open, and (c) hasn&#x27;t had all the people claiming such conspiracies mysteriously silenced.)<p>#5 doesn&#x27;t follow from #4. Push a blackmailee too hard and they&#x27;ll stop cooperating.<p>So: I still don&#x27;t see how &quot;is a puppet&quot; is supposed to follow from &quot;has been under surveillance&quot;.

Even if the NSA places you on a controlled Tor network, I could still read my gmail because the NSA would have to try to get around Google&#x27;s SSL.<p>Some bad endpoints have been known to try and MITM SSL before, but always with self signed certificates, so if the user messed up it was down to them.<p>Of course, if our endpoints are run by the NSA, and the NSA have pressured other CAs to sign *.google.com, we can only depend on cert pinning. But it&#x27;s the NSA, so how do we know that they haven&#x27;t already backdoored my browser to change the pinned fingerprints...<p>But at the end of the day, the latest I&#x27;d heard from the Snowden revelations is that Tor is a major thorn in the NSA&#x27;s side, so I&#x27;m inclined to believe that over this breathless PDF that makes all sorts of outlandish claims.<p>EDIT: From that PDF:<p>> When the DSL connection is established a covert DHCP request is sent to a secret military network owned by the U.S. Government D.O.D. You are then part of that U.S. D.O.D. military network, this happens even before you have been assigned your public IP address from your actual ISP.<p>That stretches the bounds of credulity - it assumes that a giant government-mandated conspiracy exists between ISPs, device manufacturers, networking developers... even with what we&#x27;ve seen so far it&#x27;s impossible to swallow.",1386774878

In my opinion, the biggest and hardest part of management is to take a direction provided from above and turn it into actionable points for those below. Distinctly different from directing communication.<p>A CEO typically says &quot;we need to increase sales in X vertical&quot;. It&#x27;s up to his VPs to turn that into &quot;focus our software&#x27;s next features on X&#x27;s needs&quot;, &quot;hire more sales people devoted to X&quot;, and &quot;target our marketing more on X&quot;. Then the managers look at &quot;focus our software&#x27;s next features on X&#x27;s needs&quot; and turn that into &quot;identify X&#x27;s needs&quot;, &quot;create a set of features&quot;, and &quot;execute on developing those features based on employee&#x27;s strengths&quot;.<p>Expecting an employee to turn the &quot;increase sales&quot; message into &quot;develop this feature&quot; is a bit too much to expect, not to mention nearly impossible to scale. Also, expecting the CEO to transform their own directions into individual actionable tasks is going to eat into time they could better spend on other tasks (like talking to customers, speaking at conferences, determining new direction, etc).",1386774868

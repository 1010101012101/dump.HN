1759146,comment,1758365,1759125,0,0,relix,,,"Actually, this is completely doable, even backwards compatible, with javascript:<p>JPEG has support for arbitrary metadata, mostly used today to put EXIF data in the files. IIRC, there's no reason we couldn't store a base64'd or even binary raw PNG file in there.<p>Once we put it in, we need to be able to extract it. There are EXIF javascript libraries out there, so that shouldn't be too much of a problem, since it's the same idea. I'm unsure if a binary raw PNG file could be used to generate the alpha channel like in the original article, but at least using the base64-encoded bitstream should be possible since that's natively supported.<p>It's backwards compatible since it uses the same structure as EXIF uses, which just gets ignored by non-compatible image viewers. Something easier might be to store a URL to the alpha channel PNG image in the EXIF, and then use javascript to download that image and use it as the alpha channel.<p>If I wasn't getting ready for a 2 month trip, I'd spend an hour or two whipping this up.

Obviously programming's going to be a lot more difficult while walking than playing a video game, so perhaps program the treadmill to move forward a few feet every 30 seconds or so?

I spent several years as a fairly active member of the community -- never an admin, but enough to get frequent unsolicited requests to voice in on edit disputes. During that time, every word I typed was in that awkward mock-professional tone civil servants use, masked only slightly by saccharine PR-speak when talking to noobs. Jokes were a dead giveaway you were an outsider, and there's nothing more important in the world of WP than sounding like you know what you're doing.<p>Despite all the annoying pretense and the persistent damage to my writing style, I suspect this sort of culture might be necessary, or at least not harmful, to what WP is trying to accomplish.

That it may all be implied in that chapter does not mean it is a useful resource for someone touching the subject of DSL's for the first time, because they won't grasp the implications. Implications may be clear in hindsight, when you apply all your other knowledge to that chapter, but that doesn't mean they were even remotely clear to you in the first place.<p>SICP is like a deep philosophical work: you need to study philosophy and read a lot of primary and secondary works to truly understand it's references and implications. To most people, it is not useful as a guide to writing DSL's.</i><p>This is a fair point and worth talking about. When I read SICP I already understood Lisp macros, which is a major conceptual leap. So I will admit that I cannot provide a datapoint myself to support the idea that Chapter 4 is stand alone.  However, the text itself was used in MIT's first computer science course for many years and they did teach through Chapter 4. Many other schools have used SICP in the past as well (<a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/adopt-list.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/adopt-list.html</a>). I think the fact that college freshman are capable of grasping it in a semester provides some evidence against your claim that you need ""much, much more knowledge of all kinds of things"". Hell, even spending a year to learn it would be fantastic.<p>Look, I'm with you on the fact that SICP is hard. But let's just reflect on the fact that Chapters 4 and 5 in a book written 26 (or 14) years ago give you a <i>strong foundation</i> in programming languages and compilers. There's tons of stuff you can do with this foundation, including writing DSLs. It's a pet peeve of mine that we seem to be constantly rehashing various ideas in SICP, except that we need to write thousand page books on how to express these ideas in languages like Java or C#. Based on a quick glance of the book draft, this bloat is immediately apparent! For example, the distinction between internel and external DSLs? Completely unnecessary. With an understanding of Lisp the idea of an internal DSL disappears; it's just a natural part of the language. And when you think about it, the idea of external DSLs isn't useful either. If the external DSL is expressive enough, it's just like an internal DSL; simply an extension of the language you implemented it in. If not, well then you're parsing am external file format and not a language.<p>So yes, to reiterate, teaching SICP is <i>hard</i>. But we'd be better off just biting the bullet to avoid all the bloat and repetition that results from not teaching it.",1286269623

Apps can be built from many such services, and services can be shared between apps.<p>There have been many attempts to build this sort of capability into mainstream operating systems, but none have become popular due to the inescapable complexity of IPC. A recent example is D-Bus, which is supposed to be ""lite"" yet still involves XML interface descriptions and serialization. It's enough of a hassle to implement that nobody bothers, unless it's the only option or they are evangelizing the technology.<p>QNX is built from the ground up to do everything this way. If it makes IPC easy enough, it could bring this type of software architecture to critical mass.<p>I realize this is still pretty vague, but I can't think of a specific example at the moment. If you're interested, read up on QNX, or Coyotos, which is a more experimental OS that is based fundamentally on IPC.",1286269532

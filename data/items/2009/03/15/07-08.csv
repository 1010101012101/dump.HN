Thanks for pointing out that there is a girl named ""Wendy"" from whom Dave got the name for his restaurant - it really doesn't change the point, though. There is no ""Wendy"" in the kitchen whipping up burgers for hungry customers. Wendy didn't spend years perfecting her recipes, etc, etc. In retrospect, however, I wish I had chosen Big Boy for the example instead: <a href=""http://www.bigboy.com/legend.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bigboy.com/legend.asp</a>",1237102976

Basically-- you get to a point when you realize ""The most important trick to being an amazing developer is always sincerely doubting, checking, and double-checking that fact."" I feel sorry for developers who believe they're amazing without that-- they won't truly be good until that feeling dulls somewhat and they start verifying their code by habit as if they were newbie developers.<p>In my case, I view it more like how Socrates does: ""One thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing.""<p>Design and implement as brilliantly as one can, but then use all the tools available to protect oneself from the possible dumbass mistakes that humans inevitably make.",1237102888

Tools and techniques are all well and good, but they can't become the crutch you lean on.<p>And please, please - do try more languages than just Java/C/C++/Ada.<p>I program in C/C++ with a team of very talented developers. None of us are humble, all of us believe we can be the best and we have a lot of fun. Plus our product is great!",1237101146

Even if you swear by it, given the advances in Java IDEs, I would have to be quite lazy (or careless) to write Java code that doesn't compile.""<p>You should not underestimate the power of leveraging the type system to prevent programmer error.<p>Do not think of the type system as a nanny. Instead, think of it as an integral language tool designed for your use. Use this tool -- the type system -- to convince the compiler enforce code correctness. Using the type system in this way will allow you to spend less time writing tests, as compilation can validate correctness.<p>If this seems unlikely, spend time with a language with a powerful type system -- such as OCaml, Haskell, Scala or F#. You will find that it is possible to implement equally succinct and considerably more correct code through leveraging language features -- including the type system.<p>Additionally, this exercise is fundamentally applicable with the real world. Should you use F# or Scala, you will find a vast trove of existing libraries, and high-quality, high-performance VM implementations at your fingertips. Your correct code, written faster, will run faster.",1237101073

And resource usage (like mining).<p>But you were talking about local, not about feedlots. And the reason people buy local is energy. And for that, price is an excellent way of detecting which product used less energy in it's making.<p>So if frozen blueberries from Brazil cost less than the blueberries from the farm up the road, then, despite not being local, they used less energy in the growing.<p>Personally I think that pollution is important, not just CO2, so I buy organic when I can, and I don't care in the slightest about local.",1237100960

516686,comment,516155,516431,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"> <i>""But a biological reason is that the human body is not designed for processing fructose.""</i><p>Actually that's false, it's perfectly designed for processing fructose. HFCS wouldn't be a problem if you didn't process the fructose but it still tasted sweet. The problem is we're biologically designed so that fructose doesn't trigger the same processes as regular sugar.<p>The reason for this? Well primates formed a symbiosis with trees, they gave us fruits with lots of energy in the form of fructose, and in turn we killed the species that threatened our trees.<p>The most interesting thing I learnt was on the whole question if humans would have evolved if dinosaurs had been around, and the answer was yes. It's yes, because we didn't evolve by chance, we evolved because the trees 'chose' us to. The response to large herbivores that strip-feed was primates, because we protected large areas of land and specifically the trees we fed from. The prime example of this is that when fig trees are ripening, it can be dangerous for camera crews because a 150lb chimp is likely more dangerous than a 150lb man.<p>So essentially the key problem with HFCS is that we're designed not to respond to fructose. We simply store all that sugar as fat, which again is the problem all humans face. Society is trying to fight biology, and it sure as hell isn't an easy battle.",1237100513

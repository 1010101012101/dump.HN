57271,comment,57195,57247,0,0,randallsquared,,,"I think many people are not terrified, or even particularly afraid.  I certainly don't want to die (like, ever), but I can understand those who ""are ready"" to die, now.  Ten years ago, I couldn't even understand that.  It was incomprehensible to me.  <p>Generalizing improperly from my own experience and that of people I know, it seems to me that it gets easier to accept the idea of death for many people as they age.  Hopefully we'll crack the aging thing ASAP, but I wonder how many will die of old age even after aging is more-or-less optional.",1190267789

Consoles have a marketing advantage...they're toys and don't have to mess around with  on the matter.",1190267172

I'd love to see a search feature and/or a way to tag or categorize posts for later reference. Sometimes I think ""oh, I remember reading about that on YC"" but its nearly impossible to find again.<p>Also the text (as I'm typing this) in the form field is too lightly colored and the text area is too small for me.",1190267001

In 10-15 years time, given improvement and dissemination of the technology, we might massively open up the world's communication.

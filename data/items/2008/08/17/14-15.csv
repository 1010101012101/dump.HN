278378,comment,278250,278319,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"Given what features you describe as ""benefits of VS"", it sounds like you haven't actually used any of the other editors you claim it is better than, since they have most of the same features.  I'd guess most UNIX programmers <i>have</i> used Visual Studio at some point in their programming life (its hard to avoid it!), and the reason they don't like it is because their experience wasn't very good.<p>I used Visual Studio for a week for a small project and got so sick of its interface that I ended up using it solely for the ""compile"" button (since the project had to use the Visual C compiler).<p>The Visual C compiler has its own problems: for example, it is completely incapable of maintaining stack alignment, which required us to write a rather large workaround in the x264 code to disable all functions that depend on stack alignment when compiling with MSVC.  Its lack of C99 support is also rather aggravating and gnaws at me every day when I find out that I have to reorganize the code I just wrote because I can't do something like declare a variable somewhere other than the top of a function.  It all makes me want to throw away support for MSVC completely, but there oddly enough still seem to be people who try to compile x264 with it...<p>In summary, there seems to be this arrogant attitude among Windows programmers that the UNIX programmers don't use their tools because they're being ""elitist""... but in reality, they don't use the tools because <i>they don't like them</i>.  And there's plenty of good reasons not to like them.<p>(Which strikes me as odd--I've always found Windows programmers to be on average <i>more</i> elitist than *nix programmers--the former insists that their single IDE is unquestionably the best, while the latter will recommend dozens of editors, saying that you should pick the one you like most.)",1218984669

278369,comment,278120,278162,0,0,sabat,,,"Not sure what you read, but traditional radio does not pay fees to the record industry. Zero. They do pay ASCAP/BMI fees, however. Those are just for the performance, and the artists actually do tend to get the money from that. (That's as opposed to the money the RIAA gets from CD sales, etc., which the artists almost never see.)",1218983335

278361,comment,278250,278289,0,0,trezor,,,"Agreed.<p>The article pretty much reveals that the author has never used a good IDE like Visual Studio for anything besides the obvious like adding new class-files, making some GUIs and then running a compile.<p>I bet he didn't even customize the default layout, panels and toolbars.<p>My list of top 3 features in Visual Studio, and I suspect most of them to be in Eclipse as well:<p>1) The built in debugger which can be invoked at any time, having conditional breakpoints and which automatically tells you where your code fucks up, with full statefull variable inspection. This single feature has saved me more hours than I can possibly count up trough the years. For any project not microscopic, I can't imagine not having a feature like this.<p>2) IntelliSense and code completion. Having the editor automatically look up all possible members and fields while writing code isn't just handy when it comes to speed and avoiding typos. It allows constant discovery of features in the .NET libraries whenever writing code. And when it <i>stops</i> working, you know you just did something wrong in your previous line of code. Absolutely invaluable.<p>3) The built in refactoring tools. Granted Resharper provides you with a even better toolset, but the importance of having a editor which actually <i>understands</i> your code as more than just ""text"" can't be overstated.<p>These are just a few of the things which I love about Visual Studio. It seems obvious to me as a developer that all these features would be handy for any language.<p>As for the author's praise of emacs as the text-editor which <i>can</i> be hacked and extended into something resembling a Lisp-IDE (using Lisp no less!), I guess he missed the memo that Visual Studio already <i>is</i> an IDE and can be extended infinitely as well. Last time I checked there were addons for Visual Studio for Python, Ruby and Perl. And addons for Visual Studio can be written in any language with a .NET compiler, Lisp included.<p>That the author somehow feels more ""limited"" when using a IDE, that is a editor with intelligent code-related features, than when simply using a editor, show that he is clearly full of himself.<p>To me, that seems about as intelligent as complaining about how you are feeling more ""limited"" with unused commands in /bin/ that you don't fully know or use, than if the commands weren't there at all.",1218981694

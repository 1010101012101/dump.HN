6310163,comment,6309887,6309887,22,0,confluence,,,"Most companies drive what I like to call dipshit innovation. You know what I&#x27;m talking about. The new X sandwich from McDonalds. The new X flavor from Coca Cola. Repackaged servers from Amazon. The new X phone from Apple. A variant of an already existing drug X with a different name by Pfizer. These things are not hard to develop, and that makes sense, since a company&#x27;s return horizon must be on the order of 7 years or less to stay in business. Things that only take 7 or so years to develop just cannot be that hard to do. To make real impact requires sustained investment at a loss over decade to century level time spans, a space in which only the largest companies in existence, namely nation states, can compete.<p>Now, that&#x27;s not to say that we don&#x27;t need dipshit innovation. Dipshit innovation does in fact serve a very useful purpose: it helps to reduce costs by forcing a diverse group of small agents to survive by maximizing short term profits, whilst simultaneously minimizing short term costs. Some of these profits can then be pushed back into creating the next wave of things that nation states help develop. This next wave can then be fed right back into the free market where once again a diverse group of capitalistic agents can copy, scale up and reduce the costs of the next generation of tech.<p>Problems seem to occur when there is too much of a focus on long term investment (Communist China&#x27;s/Russia&#x27;s fascination with producing iron), or when there is too much of a focus on short term investments (The world&#x27;s fascination with short term leveraged trades before the global financial crisis).<p>You really want something of a 40-60 split of resources, with 40 being pushed back into government/public institutes for long term societal level investments, and the remaining 60 going back to the free market as an incentive for further cost reductions.<p>We need both types, in the right amounts, to keep the economy chugging along. We also need competent people working on both sides of the split for us to move forward. What we don&#x27;t need is to deify one to the exclusion of the other.<p>Addendum: This talk is an amazing discussion of the ideas listed in my above hypothesis: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyp3Bw5H0VA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyp3Bw5H0VA</a> which was tipped to me from here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6310207"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6310207</a>.<p>It&#x27;s always nice when others back up what you say. But it seems that I&#x27;m always a year late with said ideas (talk is from 2012, and I hadn&#x27;t previously seen it).<p>I blame the state for funding such radical research.

6310161,comment,6309008,6309860,4,0,tzs,,,"Yes, (void * )0 gives a null pointer. I mentioned that. However, that doesn&#x27;t mean all the bits of a null pointer are required to be all 0. The actual machine representation of a null pointer is implementation-defined. The only requirement C99 places on the actual value of a null pointer is that it compares unequal to a pointer to any object or function, and any two null pointers compare equal. See section 6.3.2.3 paragraphs 3 and 4:<p><pre><code>   An integer constant expression with the value 0, or\n   such an expression cast to type void *, is called a\n   null pointer constant. If a null pointer constant\n   is converted to a pointer type, the resulting pointer,\n   called a null pointer, is guaranteed to compare unequal\n   to a pointer to any object or function.\n\n   Conversion of a null pointer to another pointer type\n   yields a null pointer of that type. Any two null pointers\n   shall compare equal.\n</code></pre>\nIf you do this:<p><pre><code>   int pv = 0;\n   char * p = (char *)pv;\n</code></pre>\nyou are not guaranteed to have p set to a null pointer, because the zero you are casting and assigning is not an integer constant zero. The behavior is implementation-defined, as is going the other way. Section 6.3.2.3 paragraphs 5 and 6:<p><pre><code>   An integer may be converted to any pointer type. Except\n   as previously specified, the result is implementation-defined,\n   might not be correctly aligned, might not point to an entity\n   of the referenced type, and might be a trap representation.\n\n   Any pointer type may be converted to an integer type. Except\n   as previously specified, the result is implementation-defined.\n   If the result cannot be represented in the integer type, the\n   behavior is undefined. The result need not be in the range of\n   values of any integer type.</code></pre>",1378040015

6310145,comment,6307931,6309283,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">the scenarios that result in errors are totally different from the error scenarios in linux.<p>Not really. It&#x27;s more like the Windows problems are a superset of the Linux problems. Most kernel panics are a result of bugs in drivers which happens just the same on Windows. Then you have all the ones based on Microsoft laziness, like getting the INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE BSOD instead of the OS trying to load some more drivers if your disk controller died and you replaced it with a different model. And then you have the fallout of Microsoft&#x27;s attempts to fix legacy software rampaging through kernel memory, which means all the legacy code that used to do that (including the ones that did something useful instead of causing a BSOD) will now just crash the application and break the legacy software, because Microsoft couldn&#x27;t be bothered to get it right the first time.<p>> most of the crashes in windows systems are the results of non-MSFT developers who wanted to insert code into the kernel.<p>The difference is that Unix-like operating systems have always discouraged that behavior so it happens a lot less often (and is a lot more suspicious), and if you have something that legitimately needs to go into the Linux kernel then it generally gets merged into the main tree. But not until you fix what problems the kernel maintainers identify, and then it gets maintained by the people who know what they&#x27;re doing.<p>> the &quot;compatibility layer&quot; is actually far more nuanced than this<p>Sounds unnecessarily complicated and undesirable.<p>> NT was designed by the team that did VMS in a 3-month retreat to Hawaii.<p>NT was never the problem.

I think that in software dev a lot of the jobs are fairly the same work environment-wise, so your take probably could work if you are only at work for the money (and I know, everyone has bills to pay, I have a family so it would be a tough call for me to make as well but I don&#x27;t think I would just try to hike my salary and hasten the doom of the company if they&#x27;ve treated me awesomely over the years)",1378039039

It presents the context for this &quot;observation&quot; as being a decrease in both public debt and the size of the government. No such thing has happened or is likely to happen any time soon. The US federal government is the largest and most powerful state in the history of the world. There is no &quot;cut&quot; that could make that less true coming in the next few years at least.<p>The core issue is that while it may be true that the state does have initiatives to fund business innovation there is a false choice being presented. The example of Apple suggests that if the government didn&#x27;t give them a grant they wouldn&#x27;t exist. The problem is that we can&#x27;t say that for certain at all. We don&#x27;t know the outcomes in a world where the taxes or loans taken to pay for those grants didn&#x27;t happen. It&#x27;s not possible to say if the outcomes would be better or worse (for the cause of Apple Computer at least) had that grant not existed.<p>The state is a mixed bag. They currently take 15% of my income to pay for my &quot;retirement&quot; when if I had been able to save that I&#x27;d end up far more secure in my retirement than I will with social security. But that said they are using that money to pay for the life support that a lot of people need. Mix that with the constant wars and you can understand why crediting the state for its&#x27; light in a world of darkness is misguided.<p>There are a lot of other odd statements in here too such as describing the state as a risk taker as if the state is ever punished for its&#x27; failures. People don&#x27;t even remember most of the CIA&#x27;s failures as they line up for war behind its&#x27; current allegations in Syria.",1378038661

It takes a lot of liberties with evidence to come to a crazy conclusion.<p>I grew up in a small state in Australia. Business there keeps close with state government: there is a stench of cronyism about much of what goes on. The standard business model there is to wait for a state government grant structure, and then weasel up to it with the right paperwork and hand-shaking to get what you want. Within the bureaucracy you have people lining themselves up to bounce out into firms.<p>The government maintains high taxes, and then spends those taxes either tying itself to emerging business like this, or propping up failing business like car companies. And it needs a large, skilled public service to keep it all moving. The result is that labour that could be used doing something people want is wasted, and it&#x27;s harder to operate free business due to the high taxation and bureaucracy. It&#x27;s not a stalled situation: many good people do still find good, rewarding local jobs creating real value despite this. But a lot of talent drains away, and there&#x27;s not much innovation despite a healthy university culture.<p>The way things work in world cities is different and better. For the most part, the more government stays out of business, the more success there is.<p>Perhaps Apple did receive some benefits in the early years. Where benefits are there for the taking, it is rational to take them. But it is not evidence that such benefits were critical to the success.<p>Governments don&#x27;t pick winners - only their mates. For progress, look elsewhere.<p>As an example of a paragraph that just doesn&#x27;t work, &quot;Other ways include giving the state bank or agency that invested a stake in the company. A good example is Finland, where the government-backed innovation fund SITRA retained equity when it invested in Nokia. There is also the possibility of keeping a share of the intellectual property rights, which are almost totally given away in the current system.&quot;<p>* Repeatedly we see state investments in companies pursuing political objectives with their shareholding at the expense of development or the company&#x27;s interest. Look at the way Lower Saxony hampers Volkswagen&#x27;s development. Or oil companies anywhere they have been nationalised (Venezuela, Mexico, Russia).<p>* Picking Nokia as an example of innovation?<p>* Intellectual property is an idea created entirely by government for the purpose of picking winners.

19743,comment,19494,19735,0,0,nurall,,,"Sorry about that aston and immad. Even I believe its not 0.5 deterministically, but I think it averages to 0.5. The system appears far more adaptive/dynamic than a completely deterministic model as suggested by the formula. But again, its a model.<p>
My friend, up-voted me once each for two separate comments, but my Karma remained the same. As a matter of fact, I observed something similar with the submissions as well. This could imply the following -<p>1. Karma calculation is not interrupt driven, but its timeout based (I probably hadn't waited long enough!) OR<p>2. The weight for the comments (/submissions?) could be a function of user Karma, with an average of 0.5 (I probably did wait long enough!) OR<p>3. My friend's up-voting was suspicious (Highly doubt it!!)  <p>
My bet is on 1 and/or 3.",1178366238

Can the Karma be negative for a user? 
The trade-off then would be between absolute web democracy Vs keeping the users 'happy' (capitalistic?)",1178365602
19740,comment,19617,19617,0,0,bootload,,,"Great inclusion. Why? Well it has to do with software developers who have highly developed skills with  algorythms, numbers and language but abysmal visual, colour, drawing and graphic design skills. So any book that 1) makes them see they have missed out developing these skills and 2) the basics of how to start and recognise what is required is good.<p>I can only think of a handful of developers who are hackers, programmers and artists.  Just like maths, writing and playing music it's just another form of literacy to be learn.",1178365291

But its fairly current to extrapolate the statistic.<p>What is the current trend, when it comes to the most preferred development framework? I am sure the open source community has marched forward since Oct 2006.",1178364499

19736,comment,19494,19496,0,0,immad,,,"Do karma point ever go negative? If they dont (which is my view) then the sum of comments is rounded to 0 if less than 0.<p>Karma = [SUM(KP1,KP2,..KPn) - n] + ROUND0[0.5x((KC1,KC2...KCm) - m)]<p>I changed ROUND to ROUND0 where ROUND0 always returns 0 or more. Is there a math way of representing that, that I cant remember?

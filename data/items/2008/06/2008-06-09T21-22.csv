I have the book ""7 habits of effective people"", and I read parts of it, but this book does not answer the core question - what does 'effective' mean?<p>For example, say I have an idea for a great product. I work on it effectively by spending time on the important features and ignoring the unimportant features. I release the software and my site rises to Alexa Rank 600.000, the slowly fades away. I was an effective programmer, but did not have any idea about marketing or sales or post sales or customer acquiring or viral growth or any of that stuff. That's not a lack of effectiveness, that's a lack of information.<p>I may have the ability to complete a task effectively, but if I do not have enough information about what tasks need to be done to be successful, I cannot apply my 'effective' skills on those tasks.<p>Do you get what I'm saying? Sam may be effective, but he's also knowledgeable about a wide range of topics, and so is able to know where to apply his methods towards. He knows about these topics because he is likely more intelligent and widely read than the average other startup founder. He is more widely read because he is more intelligent and it is easier for him to absorb more information.<p>What you call effectiveness is actually just applied intelligence. What you're actually saying is this: become more intelligent and learn how to gather a wide range of information, and then apply this information as effectively as possible, given the constraints you have to work with.<p>What I'm saying is this: this 'effectiveness' you say Sam has, it's not replicable, because it's made up of intelligence and a talent for applying this intelligence. And those are not available to everyone, unfortunately.",1213048499

The grass is always greener, of course, and people are most likely to see the advantages on the other side.<p>> Large corporations have access to the public markets and hundreds of other financing options.<p>This isn't some benefit that's dolled out by a controlling group, like the government. This is because people are willing to invest money, because they are much more stable. Startups are incredibly risky, and most will fail. If you give a ""benefit"" to investing in startups so that more people invest, someone is losing somewhere.

213213,comment,213054,213054,0,0,apu,,,"The learning curve of vim is indeed steep, but it's been incredibly well worth it for me. The key thing to remember about vim is that it's very much oriented towards <i>editing</i> text, not so much creating it. (In general, writing lots of text is easy and there are few differences from editor to editor.)<p>But fast editing using only the keyboard is where vim really shines. In my experience, the biggest wins are the uniform command structures and the huge number of movement options. Since most commands in vim take the form of <number-of-repititions><command><movement area>, you need master only the various movement types to effectively start using a large number of commands. Movement areas (called ""motions"") can be word-by-word, long jumps within a sentence, going between paragraphs, matching code structures (braces/parenthesis/functions/etc.), etc. Learning these motions lets you quickly jump to exactly where you need to, resulting in super-fast editing.<p>Of course, there are all the usual search-and-replace type of commands, multiple buffers/screens/tabs, very easy macro recording and playback, and plugins for project management, source control, etc., but none of these particularly distinguish vim from other good editors.<p>The one 'weakness' of vim is that it's much less of an ""OS"" than editors like emacs. Instead, it has a few well-chosen external commands that are built-in (grep, make, etc.), and otherwise lets you run shell commands directly (piping input into the current file, if wanted) for everything else. This, IMO, is more in keeping with the unix mentality of piping together lots of small programs that each do one thing well. So for example, you can sort and keep only unique lines in a text file by simply selecting them and running the standard 'sort' and 'uniq' commands (exactly as you would do on the command line). Your personal preference is what decides whether this is a weakness (as emacs users would probably feel) or a strength (as I and many other vim users feel).<p>Finally, I would recommend learning vim as you would learn a new language: use it all the time and slowly pick up new features (not all at once) until you become proficient. I use it not only as my editor for all text and programming on my machine, but also for editing text boxes in firefox and editing emails in thunderbird.

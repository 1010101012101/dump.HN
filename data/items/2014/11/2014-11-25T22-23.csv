Socially he&#x27;s pretty incapable. I think his offensive racist, homophobic and other offensive remarks are part and parcel of his condition because I&#x27;ve spent quite a lot of time reading his rants, and disagree with your claim that his use of slurs is not random and generic. It&#x27;s not uncommon for him to claim that &#x27;bill gAtes is an atheist nigger&#x27; and talk about hod God likes &#x27;African musical rhythms and does not like white people so much&#x27; on the same day.<p>Yes, he does seem to use the epithet &#x27;nigger&#x27; more than all other epithets combined, which is understandably alienating for many people. But I don&#x27;t think this is ideologically rooted because it is so randomly and inconsistently applied in his writing (where it makes up a small fraction of the overall output, rather than the 99% you suggest).<p>Being an atheist, his output of random passages from the Bible is neither admirable nor otherwise to me - it&#x27;s just statistically the most likely religious text for an American with a religious fixation to be fixated on. I&#x27;ve met mentally ill Asian Buddhists whose cognitive patterns are quite similar to Terry&#x27;s even though the cultural referents are completely different. Extreme religiosity is very strongly correlated with some kinds of mental illness and I don&#x27;t find it strange that Terry is fixated on Old Testament Bible stories where God puts in a lot of personal appearances. I could just as easily imagine him being obsessed with the Koran or some other religious text that&#x27;s ubiquitous in some other part of the world.<p>I can&#x27;t agree that he&#x27;s an extremist - his (inoffensive)
&#x27;Guidelines for talking to God&#x27; [1]are pretty bland and heretodox as he eschews questions of salvation, morality etc., in favor of keeping God company (which makes sense since God is apparently a fixture in Terry&#x27;s life). According to Terry, God dislikes classical music, Shakespeare, French people, and Terry&#x27;s drumming while exhibiting an inordinate fondness for elephants, bears, and 1960s pop singers. You could work these elements into some sort of coherent ideological position just as you could characterize his relentless automated Biblical quotation as Christian extremism, but I don&#x27;t think either position makes sense.<p>What&#x27;s remarkable about him is not the endless stream of nonsense, much of which is offensive when it&#x27;s even coherent; it&#x27;s the fact that he manages to construct working things as part of his intellectual pursuits and carry on some kind of social life despite his mental circumstances.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.templeos.org/Wb/Adam/God/HSNotes.html#l1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.templeos.org/Wb/Adam/God/HSNotes.html#l1</a>",1416955752

Any methodology that is popular enough for you to have heard about it was developed by one or more smart people and solved some real problem.  Between now and then though, countless cargo-culters have jumped on the bandwagon and misapplied the methodology to the wrong problem in innumerable ways.  Maybe they implemented it wrong, maybe they didn&#x27;t have applicable problems, maybe they are as dumb as a box of rocks but have carved out a comfortable niche in a fat corporation somewhere.  The point is, a methodology is <i>meaningless</i> out of context.<p>Hell, all ideas are meaningless out of context.  In every day human life we tend to share a lot of context with those around us, in terms of software development—ie. the stuff of pure thought where the only limit is logic itself—we share considerably less so.  When you&#x27;re writing a web app you are living in a wholly different world from someone writing a Mars lander ROM, yet we call both of those things &quot;software engineering&quot;.  If you want to have good ideas and be competent you have to apply whatever ideas to the context you are in.  Being smart is not about having the best ideas, but about evaluating how ideas apply to and interact with systems.  The hardest thing about entrepreneurship isn&#x27;t figuring out how to write software to do X, it&#x27;s how to choose X such that a cascading chain of seemingly random events translate into market traction.<p>The horrifying thing about software development is the limited intelligence of the human brain to begin with.  From a certain perspective we are hopelessly stupid and incapable of truly elegant software design, but on the other hand we are the only entities we know of with the capacity to write software at all!  All this is to say you need to embrace ignorance and subjectivity, and simply pledge yourself to continual improvement.  You do this not by latching onto ideas and filing them into good or bad buckets, but rather by processing a lot of them, applying them in practice, and seeing how those with more experience than you do the same.<p>If your curiosity outweighs your frustration over a period of decades, eventually I guarantee you will be at least a competent software developer, and maybe by then ageism in a tech will be something the kids laugh at like televisions with twisty knobs.",1416955007

- A check that blows up the program if it fails
- A check that has a really convenient syntax<p>The &quot;disabled at compile time&quot; bit is pretty much insane (at least in a language with side-effects) -- you&#x27;ll inevitably end up accidentally having some sort of side-effect in your asserts, and if you turn them off for your production build, you&#x27;re basically inserting a whole brand-new untested configuration, running in a build that is particularly hard to debug. But probably most people just leave asserts &quot;on&quot; all the time. (Even if you don&#x27;t have side-effects in your asserts, you&#x27;re still enabling untested run-paths, which is going to give weird, hard to debug error reports.)<p>The second thing is blowing up the program. Sometimes, this really is all you can do, and every language has some way for this to happen -- take the head of an empty list, access beyond an array bounds, whatever.<p>The problem is combining it with the really convenient syntax -- it&#x27;s just very tempting to assert conditions which you should actually be handling more robustly, because assert is the easiest thing to write.<p>I&#x27;m doing a mix of Go server-side dev and Obj-C client side dev at the moment, and I do use asserts in Obj-C land.<p>I try to only use them only for truly &quot;programmer screwed up&quot; conditions, which should all be caught during development.

-- From Vapnik&#x27;s preface to <i>The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory</i><p><i></i>*<p>Vapnik is not well-described as a &quot;theory guy&quot;.  That implies that he&#x27;s not interested in connections between theory and practice, and this is most profoundly not the case.  He has arguably been the most successful ML researcher ever as far as connecting abstract theory to real-world outcomes.<p>Besides the SVM: the VC dimension started out as a lemma regarding set counting, and he pushed it to the surprising (even shocking) conclusion of universal consistency for very general classes of estimators.",1416953362

When all the information you need to make a purchase is stamped right on it and or completely public (e.g. address).<p>- &quot;Verified by Visa&quot; and &quot;Mastercard securecode&quot; help a little but they&#x27;re badly done, poorly supported, and are trivial to bypass (they also rarely work on mobile devices).<p>- This is largely a parental issue. You aren&#x27;t bringing up a &quot;good kid&quot; if they either A) don&#x27;t understand the value of a pound, or B) do but don&#x27;t care.<p>- Parents often blame the companies for &quot;allowing&quot; this to occur after the parents themselves knowingly added their card onto a system their kid has unlimited spending potential on (e.g. app stores, other digital goods, even Amazon).<p>- I think it would be a nice gesture for EA to refund SOME of the money but, frankly, the parents deserve to take some level of hit on this one.<p>- Most banks suck at informing their customers about unusual activity, like 2500 pounds on digital goods over a short period(!).",1416953209

Just because you say something and may or may not mean what someone else meant does not remove the broader social context. The word is racist because of the social context and when you use it you evoke that context whether you understand it, agree with it, or not.<p>Edit: to be clear, my point is that evoking such an idea or meaning is violent towards others and an individual doesn&#x27;t get to decide that this isn&#x27;t the case.

Find out if they are currently using some other solution to the problem (your competitors).<p>Approach an industry organisation, if there is one, and talk to them about the problem, who has any existing or new solutions and find out if they have market research from their members.<p>Just a comment about the above two points, you don&#x27;t have to pitch your specific solution to the problem but I would still leave the door open when you are talking to people and say something like, &quot;if I were to come up with a solution that would do (insert features and benefits) would you be interested in talking further?&quot;  If the problem just isn&#x27;t perceived by your customers to be painful or valuable then I would move on.<p>Now assuming the pain is sufficient and a solution is valuable then start looking at the economics of the business and start &#x27;building the market.&#x27;  What I mean by that is start with some assumptions about customer characteristics, for example demographics, and start putting some numbers together in terms of total market size.  Try to do this from different angles and use different assumptions.<p>Then start playing around with what you think your cost and profit structure would look like with different business models.  Think about what your cash burn rate will be and what sort of adoption you will need to hit a &#x27;cash neutral&#x27; and break even scenario.<p>Then start applying this to your &#x27;whole of market&#x27; model that you did before and start thinking if it makes sense.  Do you need 1% or 0.0001% of the market to start adopting your solution?  What might it cost to acquire those customers in terms of time and money?  Start thinking about how that relates to hitting your &#x27;cash neutral&#x27; and break even scenario.<p>Take a step back.  Does this make sense?  How much work is involved?  How much capital are you going to need to achieve this?  Then multiply that by say 4-5 times to give you a margin for error.<p>Now start thinking about post &#x27;cash neutral&#x27; scenarios where you are capturing different rates of the market.  How much do your costs ramp up?  What is your marginal profitability?  What does this equate to in terms of return on capital?  If the returns are low then forget it.  Investors want you to return their capital plus a big fat profit.  If you don&#x27;t think you can grow a big enough pie so you can get a slice of it that will satisfy you then forget it and find another opportunity.<p>If things look like they are stacking up well and you got a good story to sell to investors then good luck.  Raising money is a bitch.  Assuming you manage to get enough then things get harder because you will now have to execute within the cash &#x27;runway&#x27; you have been given and well the rest at that point is up to you, your team and luck.",1416952943

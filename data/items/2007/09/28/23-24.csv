60883,comment,60507,60862,0,0,shadowplay,,,"Sounds like you worked with some pretty uptight people!  I would suggest buying them copies of Spice World.  And no, ""Hacker News"" is not a professional setting, it's certainly informal.  ""Women"" is itself a loaded term to many feminists, who may prefer ""womyn"", ""womun"", or some other spelling. <p>In order for ""girl"" to be insulting, you must subscribe to the notion that there is something wrong with being young and female.  Accepting that premise is to unwittingly agree with perpetuating a worldview in which the very notion of female-ness is disempowering.  ""Girl Power"" actually challenges the establishment; suppression of any reference to femininity reinforces the older male status quo.<p>That so many people are programmed to think ""girl"" is insulting just shows how far society still needs to go to free itself from counterproductive paradigms.<p>> <i>never call a woman a girl in a situation where it would be inappropriate to call her a bitch</i><p>Your implication of equivalence is loony, and of course more evidence for the informality of Hacker News.  Your post also suggests to me a useful reason to use the terms ""girls"" and ""boys"" -- to smoke out people who get offended so easily or are stuck with such old paradigms that they clearly lack the flexibility needed to work in a start-up.  Valuable co-founders aren't stuck with old thinking, are <i>hard</i> to offend and <i>easy</i> to joke around with.\n",1191023212

(That's after discounting marketing considerations.)  <p>The blogger says: ""Naively lauding the alleged ""wisdom of crowds"" obscures the critical issue, which is the design of the distributed algorithm --- i.e., the social organization of the crowd. What are its mechanisms for passing information?...""<p>Surowiecki believes there are some necessary conditions to have some wisdom from crowds: diversity, independence, and a particular kind of decentralization.  He points out in the book that design of the crowd and their interaction is essential to wisdom of crowds. Yadda yadda.<p>The blogger says: ""Now, as I said, I have not read Surowiecki's book. It is entirely possible that I'm being utterly unfair to him based on the yammerings of others.""<p>Yes, you are being utterly unfair. No up arrow for you.",1191023124

60873,comment,60507,60797,0,0,davidw,,,"I didn't post that just to be PC, I posted it because I felt that in that context, ""women"" would have been a preferable, more respectful term, even though I wholeheartedly agree that English is a bit lacking in that it forces you to choose between ""girl"" and ""woman"", neither one of which is ideal.  I would have erred on the side of respect, though.<p>Italian has ragazzo/a, which can be used both formally, and informally, for anyone from their teens to early thirties.  It's far superior to the dichotomy that English forces upon us, but be that as it may, ""girls"" is probably left to women to use amongst themselves as they see fit.",1191021677

Where are the possibilities for feedback loops?""<p>I didn't read the book as suggesting this was required. Surowecki champions a diverse set of people with diverse knowledge, consensus is reached when that knowledge combined tells us the crowd's opinion. Feedback loops are not considered. ""The Wisdom of Crowds"" applies more when people are acting in their own interests than collaborating towards a solution. Perhaps feedback loops are even what throws this system of crowd wisdom off (bubbles?).",1191021320

60862,comment,60507,60797,0,0,bls,,,"Have you ever had a serious job with female coworkers? I'm going to guess ""no,"" since your entire post is nonsense. <p>First, you are referring to informal situations. But, this is (supposed to be) a professional setting, and the rules are much different in a professional setting. Generally, you want to refer to the femininity of women as little as possible in a professional setting, and when you do have to refer to their femininity, you must be extra formal.<p>Here is the rule I go by: never call a woman a girl in a situation where it would be inappropriate to call her a bitch (she better be a good friend). And, never call a black man a boy because it is almost as bad as ""nigger.""<p>If you don't understand the reasoning behind these rules then you should find a good friend to explain them to you very carefully.",1191020649

But recently I started embracing the fact that ads are what makes the Internet free. Without them, we'd have to pay 5 cents for every email and 15 sent for every search. I'll see what I can do about the design, though. Maybe I can make it less ""messy"".<p>And, none of the ads on the home page are paid, by the way.

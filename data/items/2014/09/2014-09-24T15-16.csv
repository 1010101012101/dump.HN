There are patterns all over the place.<p>Renaissance Technologies is famous for its pattern matching AI.  They hired 2 key employees out of IBM many years ago that layed the base for their technology and the rest has been money making history.  See: <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/bob-mercer-peter-brown-2010-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/bob-mercer-peter-brown-2010-3</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Technologies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Technologies</a><p>The world of trading has been a cat and mouse game of pattern matching for awhile.  One of the earliest attempt at hiding large orders was an algorithm called POV( Percent of Volume).  \nIt&#x27;s an order that would slice up a big order into smaller chunks and sell it throughout the day.  The first variations would just sell every 10 minutes.  Its easy to see how someone could find this pattern (Hmm, it seems like 1,000 MSFT are being sold at market every 10 minutes by Goldman Sachs) and exploit it which lead to more intelligent order spreading, and the cycle continues.<p>However, if by technical analysis you mean looking for patterns like &quot;head and shoulders&quot; (<a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/head-shoulders.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/head-shoulders.asp</a>) then it might be true only in that if so many people/computers believe in it that it becomes a self fulling prophecy. \nFor example, if every one believes that when a stock crosses above its 20 and 50 day moving average then its going to fall, then it will fall just because everyone will start selling because they believe it will fall, which causes it to fall which reinforces everyone&#x27;s belief that the pattern works and you have a positive feed back cycle.<p>Does that mean technical analysis works? IMHO this type of investing doesn&#x27;t work, but who am I to say...",1411574300

8362162,comment,8356695,8359352,1,0,heavenlyhash,,,"> My favourite solution by far, though, is the one recently implemented by Elixir: log() is a regular function, but takes a closure instead of a string.<p>This is a pretty fantastic route as far as syntactical simplicity goes.<p>I wonder if it can have an implications on the generated assembly nonetheless?  Could there be extra assembly generated <i>outside</i> the branch for logging level check, which is necessary to bind the variables for the closure?<p>Similarly, I might suspect that an optimizing compiler that is considering a function for inlining might change its mind for any function where it sees a nontrivial closure like that, without knowing that &quot;trace&quot; level logging nearly never happens.<p>&quot;Edge cases&quot;, to be sure, and the answers are surely different between languages, but interesting to consider nonetheless.",1411574261

8362160,comment,8357207,8357207,4,0,robomartin,,,"This thread is really interesting.  You can see a bunch of engineering types doing their best to slice and dice this from a million logical angles.  I would have done the same 20 years ago when I launched my product and went out there to sell it.<p>The difference? I was honest enough to recognize I was going to approach sales as an engineer.  I got help in the form of experienced non-engineer sales people tutoring me by going on sales calls with me and doing review sessions after every sales call.<p>The first two quarters sucked.  It took me about three months to truly stop thinking as an engineer and another three to optimize my style, delivery and approach.  We closed the third quarter with over $600K in sales, most of which I was responsible for.<p>I would eventually hire sales and marketing people so I could devote more time to engineering.  I felt it was important to understand the sales process by becoming a sales and marketing person myself (for about two years on and off) before staffing thise positions.  I have always been glad I took that approach.  We engineers are great about building products but absolutely suck at selling.<p>The letter that is the subject of this thread isn&#x27;t fantastic.  That said, it achieved several things all the engineers on HN are ignoring:<p>- Made a sale!  Do not underestimate the importance and power of cash in the bank!<p>- It deprived a competitor of revenue. Every dollar you take away from your competition is a dollar that goes towards potentially taking them out of the race, particularly with low price sellers.<p>- It was compelling enough to take someone who was on the fence and flip him to the point of having him write a blog post about the experience<p>- It probably created a long term believer and evangelist for their brand, product and price model<p>- It confirmed that this tactic works.  They can use it with new potential customers, evolve and fine tune it.  They might also consider integrating aspects of this message in other marketing efforts.<p>- It revealed that the competitor&#x27;s low price position is tenuous at best<p>- It started a relationship with a new customer in a very positive tone.  If nurtured this could lead to more sales from word of mouth<p>- Because of some of the above their cost of customer aquisition is likely to reduce over time<p>I could probably add to this.  The point is that most of the criticism here is misplaced.  This letter isn&#x27;t genius. It doesn&#x27;t have to be.  It only has to be effective.  That, it is.<p>I don&#x27;t expect everyone to get this.  In typical engineer/HN fashion this will be sliced, diced and down-voted from a million of irrelevant angles.  That&#x27;s OK. I get it. The interesting thing is, regardless of what is said here, that letter still made a sale and accomplished all I have highlighted and more.",1411574247

8362140,comment,8358871,8361272,1,0,amandalotti,,,"Hi Tom this is a great q. I&#x27;m the MD on the team here at Iodine.<p>As you know, many people already stop taking their antibiotics without finishing the full course. According to our internal research, people get most freaked out about side effects when they didn&#x27;t expect them or didn&#x27;t know they might happen, and when they didn&#x27;t know it was a common or normal response to a medication. It&#x27;s our hypothesis that surfacing this data (much of which does already exist online) will actually help with what clinicians refer to as &quot;anticipatory guidance&quot; -- helping people know what to expect -- and that this could reassure people when they do have a side effect, and help them realize that it&#x27;s temporary. Good anticipatory guidance doesn&#x27;t always happen in the exam room due to time constraints, etc. In a couple studies we cited in an Iodine blog post recently, docs spend an average of 12 seconds talking with patients about side effects of a new med, and 50% of these new med convos don&#x27;t mention expected side effects at all. <a href=""http://www.iodine.com/blog/11-questions-to-ask-about-medications/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iodine.com/blog/11-questions-to-ask-about-medicat...</a>.<p>Additionally, our content will develop with more info about how to take a med, including this really important caveat about antibiotics. Another one I can think of is acetaminophen and its really important risk/warning about liver failure.<p>We still have a lot of work to do at Iodine, but we think we&#x27;ve got a good start.

So if your grandfather served in the military and joined USAA, your father could become a member based on his relationship with your grandfather, and you could become a member because your father is a member.<p>This is how I was able to join. My grandfather was in the Navy and was a USAA member. My dad joined way back before I was born, and I joined when I was in high school.<p>At first, I just used their car insurance products. After college when my bank (Regions Bank) decided to start charging me all kinds of stupid fees, I switched my checking over to USAA. As time has gone on, I&#x27;ve moved almost all my financial products over to them. Several checking accounts, several savings accounts, a credit card, investments, etc.<p>They are, without a doubt, the best &quot;bank&quot; I&#x27;ve ever worked with.<p>There&#x27;s only a few things left that I&#x27;m not with them on: my homeowner&#x27;s insurance, which I&#x27;m about to move over to them after a nasty experience with Liberty Mutual, and my daughter&#x27;s 529 college saving plan, because you only get the tax benefits in this state if you use the state&#x27;s 529 program.

The resolution of the data is adequate, but there are artifacts related to the way the data was collected and processed.  There are discontinuous edges throughout the data.  Also, of course, the data is not the elevation along a route.  Bridges and other things over or under which one might ride a bicycle must be accounted for externally.  Even roads in trenches or cuts need special attention.<p>I think the only way to make such an application work is to combine the elevation data of numerous sources, SRTM being just one.

And the experiments are all geared towards finding the most effective ways to exploit the way our minds work, to the benefit of the owner of the product or idea being marketed. [3]<p>I am aware that there are some who do have ethics, and apply them scrupulously.   But in the marketing that surrounds us every day, I see no indication that they have any significant voice.<p>For those not familiar with Heinlein, some of the ideas raised in &quot;If This Goes On...&quot; are disturbingly relevant.<p>---<p>1. And this is the general &quot;you&quot;, not typically one specific individual.<p>2. The salesperson, too, will naturally try to manipulate you - but a)  it&#x27;s typically an interaction between you and the salesperson.    b) you can also use the same or similar tactics on the salesperson.   c) foreknowledge of the tactics used by a salesperson are often enough to protect against their effectiveness  - not so with marketing.",1411571814

Charles Schwab (lowest limit on mobile check deposits, was $2000/day max when I checked)\n2. USAA (available to family members of military only when I checked)\n3. ING Direct (later bought by Capital One and renamed to Capital One 360 - this is what I now use)\n4. Simple (formerly banksimple, now just simple.com)<p>I was on the waiting list for Simple, but before they gave me the invite I ended up getting set up with ING Direct, and even though they are now Capital One 360, nothing about the program has changed and it meets all my needs - it&#x27;s great!  The best parts, besides the no monthly fees etc which was a prerequisite for me, is they give you a small credit line attached to your primary account ($500 to start though you can ask for an increase if you want), and if you do happen to overdraft they just charge you interest based on the overdraft amount, which ends up being a few pennies at the end of the month - no overdraft fees at all. If you don&#x27;t have the credit line or you go over, the transactions are just declined.<p>I still have a Charles Schwab account, because in addition to no monthly fees, they refund ALL atm fees from anywhere, even the ones that the atm owners charge.  You can literally use a $10-fee atm at like disneyland or on a cruise ship, and they will refund the fee.  I keep a small amount of cash in here for when I want to get cash from an ATM and don&#x27;t want to look for one that is feeless for my regular bank (Capital One 360 which uses AllPoint atms so they are plentiful, but hey my laziness knows no bounds)<p>I was never able to try USAA despite hearing great things because no one I know was in the military.<p>I was planning to switch to Simple once I was able, but ended up staying with Capital One 360 since it&#x27;s great.  Oh yeah, another awesome feature you don&#x27;t get anywhere else, that started with ING direct but capital one has kept it, is you can open an unlimited amount of savings accounts.  It&#x27;s really one savings account in the background, but they treat the amounts separately as if they are separate accounts, so from the front end it seems that they are. This is awesome for setting up savings goal, automatic savings deductions for various purposes (like quarterly tax estimates if you are self-employed), etc.<p>The stupid employer I&#x27;m at wouldn&#x27;t let me sign up for direct deposit until I had been working here for 6 months (I know, what kind of policy is that, right??) -- and even though it&#x27;s the highest mobile check deposit limit I could find, Capital One 360 still has a $3000-per-check limit on mobile deposit.  My employer not only wouldn&#x27;t let me get direct deposit right away, but pays monthly, so since my paycheck was bigger than the limit I was forced to go back to a &quot;regular&quot; bank for a few months.<p>So I got a Bank of America account.  They charged me $12 a month for the privilege of using their services without having direct deposit set up (if I could set it up I wouldn&#x27;t need them!).  Closed that account as soon as I was able to get direct deposit, which I set up for my CO-360 account.  Branch manager of BoA was disappointed (ha).<p>I did move to a new apartment in the middle of that, and needed a cashier&#x27;s check or money order for the deposit. Years past had always just gotten a cashier&#x27;s check from my bank, they usually let you do like one a month for free if you had an account -- nope they don&#x27;t do that anymore.  $10 fee.  (Screw that, went to Walmart and got a money order for 49 cents).\nAlso asked about notarization -- don&#x27;t need it right now but since I was asking about cashier&#x27;s checks anyway thought I&#x27;d ask if I could still get something notarized if I had an account -- nope sorry, they do have a notary but they are only allowed to notarize official Bank of America documents.  Wtf??<p>Anyway, my BofA account is closed as of a few weeks ago, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier to not be their customer anymore.  Fully set up with direct deposit to Capital One 360 now, and that&#x27;s where I intend to stay for the next decade.  (Unless they start screwing up their deal in which case I&#x27;m sure simple would still love to have me -- only thing I don&#x27;t like about them is I prefer having a mastercard debit card rather than visa)<p>Hope any of this info is useful to somebody.",1411571480

So I&#x27;ll say how I got started. I started by dealing with issues on a large project (CocoaPods). I read all documentation then started dealing with issues that were user errors rather than code. It gave me exposure to the devs in a large project, gave a sense of where common problems lay. Instead of directly working on the product I started to expand the tooling around the project, building websites / logos. Eventually it just gets to a point where writing a PR to anyone on any project is no-effort at all.<p>If you really want a one step start: go fix typos in other people&#x27;s READMEs.",1411571261

But there are plenty of ways in which nasty things could happen on Earth that the population here is simply not prepared for. A major asteroid impact or supervolcano eruption could cause terrible weather for years (even if we don&#x27;t go all the way to the &quot;atmosphere is a pizza oven&quot; point), and it would be awfully tough to keep feeding our cities. At that point, most industry collapses, and we&#x27;re all interdependent enough that the ripple effects could wipe out the vast majority of the human population, or even all of it.<p>Having a self-sufficient population on (say) Mars would make it likely that <i>some</i> portion of human civilization would survive such a disaster. I guess you might argue that we could achieve much of the same effect by using the same technologies to establish self-sufficient populations in safe(r) locations right here on Earth: underground or deep underwater, for example. But those would still be <i>more</i> affected by local disasters than a colony off-planet would be, and I feel like it would be harder to recruit people to live there (and harder to guarantee that they were truly self-sufficient).

Sure, our government is an organization that has the ability to take away our self-claimed rights. The whole point that our founding fathers set out to achieve was to give government so little power, and to check the power it did get, so as to allow people to live free of government coercion. But no, people decided along the way that we needed to make government bigger, and here we are.<p>I have yet to understand where you&#x27;re going with this. If companies inevitably become so powerful that they become governments, then letting the sitting government regulate them is inconsequential; takeover is inevitable! Let&#x27;s just all eat worms and die!<p>No. I think the original thinking during the age of reason makes more sense to me. I think that the people truly hold the power, and as long as we don&#x27;t give up our inalienable rights to governments (in whatever form they exist), and be sure to always question and hold suspect the people we put into the collective positions of power, then we&#x27;ll be ok.<p>Don&#x27;t forget that the limited liability that we give corporations is a <i>government-granted right</i>. That&#x27;s one of the major reasons we have issues with large companies.<p>(I&#x27;m not going to get into a debate about Coolidge.

7268835,comment,7268483,7268550,2,0,panzi,,,"I don&#x27;t think there is something inherent to either language that makes it more or less suited to sys admin tasks. Python just happens to be used more often for this. Many Linux sys admin tools (GUI and non-GUI) are written in Python (PyQt/PyGTK). yum, HP printer tools, firewalld, the setup tools of many distributions, dtrace, iotop, anaconda, mercurial.<p>Python is stricter and more explicit. Ruby has many convenience functions that I consider messy and some even dangerous. E.g. Ruby supports the same ` `-Syntax as the Unix shell, with all it&#x27;s implications.<p>So in Ruby you could do:<p><pre><code>    output = `/some/app #{arg}`\n</code></pre>\nAnd in Python you would do this:<p><pre><code>    import subprocess\n    output = subprocess.Popen([&quot;/some/app&quot;,arg],stdout=subprocess.PIPE).stdout.read()\n</code></pre>\nYes, it&#x27;s more to write but it&#x27;s more powerful and you don&#x27;t have code injection problems. It feels to me that Python encourages you to do the proper clean thing while Ruby tries to be very concise and quick.<p>Also compare regular expressions.<p>Ruby:<p><pre><code>    if &quot;foo&quot; =~ /f(oo)/\n        puts $1\n    end\n</code></pre>\nOh my god, it assigns a global(?)/magic variable as a side effect. Yes, there are other ways to do it and when I write Ruby code I am using these other ways, but when I see other peoples Ruby code its done like that. I do this:<p><pre><code>    match = /f(oo)/.match(&quot;foo&quot;)\n    if match\n        puts match[1]\n    end\n</code></pre>\nPython:<p><pre><code>    import re\n    match = re.match(&quot;f(oo)&quot;,&quot;foo&quot;)\n    if match:\n        print(match.group(1))\n</code></pre>\nIf you evaluate the regular expression more than once you should compile it:<p><pre><code>    import re\n    regex = re.compile(&quot;f(oo)&quot;)\n    match = regex.match(&quot;foo&quot;)\n    if match:\n        print(match.group(1))\n</code></pre>\nAgain in Python you tend to write it the clean way. Of course it&#x27;s possible to write non-clean Python code and clean Ruby code, but the culture behind the languages encourage different things. You will find a lot of Ruby libraries/frameworks that extend (monkey patch) standard types. While this is also possible in Python (for non-builtin/-binding types) it is usually not done. Look at JavaScript: Prototype monkey patched a lot of standard types and messed up a lot. jQuery learned from that and tries not to monkey patch anything.<p>Another issue is string encodings. Note that what I write here applies to Python 3. It&#x27;s a bit more complicated/less clean in Python 2.<p>The idea in Python is that files/network streams etc. are binary data and thus somehow encoded. But you as a programmer don&#x27;t care about encodings, you want to manipulate text (or sequences of unicode code points). So you read bytes and decode them into str(ing)s. After you are done processing the text you encode with a certain encoding again and write the bytes into the file/network stream. So there is the bytes (and bytearray) class that has a decode method and there is the str class that has an encode method. str objects are always valid unicode codepoint sequences. Encoding errors can only happen on decode/encode.<p>In Ruby there are only Strings. These strings have an encoding attached. Binary data has the &quot;encoding&quot; ASCII-8BIT. You can force a wrong encoding onto a string which will cause an InvalidByteSequenceError at some later point. If you try to concatenate two String objects that have a different encoding you will get a CompatibilityError. You can only hope that all your DB drivers return proper UTF-8 strings in all cases. I was told even Perl does this better (like Python).<p>Furthermore in Ruby strings are mutable, in Python they are immutable. This means if you get a string passed in Ruby and want to store it in a classes attribute and want to be sure it does not change under your but you have to make a copy.<p>So you can clearly see what language I think is cleaner.\nI write Ruby code for work but when I write some shell script to automate some task/write some small GUI tool I use Python (and PyQt).",1392869746

Then you&#x27;ve lost everything, because it was locked into their proprietary little system.  I don&#x27;t understand how anyone would chose one of these as their primary method of communication.<p>Especially as they are all newcomers, and email was well established as what the world used to communicate before they arrived.  No-one buys a phone and then decides &#x27;Hmm shall I install email or WhatsApp&#x27;; no, you buy a phone, you set-up the email account that you&#x27;ve already had for 20 years, and then after that you maybe decide to install another app.  This app offers nothing over email, yet you and all your friends abandon email and use the new app instead?

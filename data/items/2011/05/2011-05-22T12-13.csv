2573174,comment,2571501,2573117,6,0,Vivtek,,,"Speaking as a professional translator, let me encourage you to look beyond dictionary definitions - each definition in a dictionary means that the word in question <i>can</i> stand in a particular role.  A true pair of synonyms would coincide in meaning in all situations.  Dictionaries can be very dangerous tools indeed in unsure hands.  I know I've injured myself with them repeatedly, as has every translator at some time or another.<p>""Actual"" is a common mistranslation from French or German.  As a rule of thumb, actuel/aktuell can almost always be translated as ""current"".  ""Actual"" in English means something more like ""true"".<p>In the phrase ""actual situation"", ""actual"" does take on the Latin meaning of ""existing now or current"", but you can see that today's gloss of ""true"" also fits there: ""true situation"" works pretty well to describe the actual situation.  Although come to think of it, ""actual situation"" sounds little odd to my ear (although that is a very dangerous metric, because <i>everything</i> can sound odd if you think too hard about it).",1306069155

2573166,comment,2568362,2569119,1,0,chexton,,,"From memory, I am quite sure that here in Australia standard bank cards, which are generally referred to as debit cards, use an entirely different fee structure to credit cards.  These bank cards always require a PIN and work on the EFTPOS network.  Important, as you can't use them online.  The rate is a flat one if I'm correct.<p>Debit cards issued by Visa or Mastercard and operating over those networks incur a lower fee than credit cards but follow the same interchange fee structure.  Australian Visa interchange fees are here: <a href=""http://bit.ly/visainterchangefees"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/visainterchangefees</a>.  Just incase anyone was interested.

Students do better at math in East Asia than in the US because East Asian math teachers know math and American math teachers don't.<p>My own experience bears this out.  I once taught in a program to help public school teachers get certified to teach mathematics.  I simply couldn't believe these teachers had college degrees.  I was teaching geometry, and none of them could go to the board, draw a circle with a compass and label the center point A.  It took them two weeks to learn that the center of a circle is in the middle, not on the circumference -- and, believe me, I tried to explain it.  Of course, none of the teachers could add fractions either.  These teachers were impressive people -- it's not easy to play parent, social worker, and cop to fifty teenagers at a time -- but they were absolutely uneducated. It seems that education majors aren't taught the rudiments of the subjects they're meant to teach.  Teachers wish they knew math and they're grateful to anyone who will teach them -- they were so grateful to me that I was terribly embarrassed.  I don't know what's going on in education departments, but it's a real disservice to teachers and students.",1306067154

When the iPads are out of date they can be sold off as refurbs. (They're embedded in plexiglass boxes so unlikely to get scratched up by customers.)<p>5. Power consumption of an iPad is dwarfed by the power consumption of the lighting and aircon/heating for that amount of floor space in a premium store.<p>6.

2573123,comment,2571490,2572370,1,0,Silhouette,,,"> Modern browsers have most of these:<p>Well, modern browsers have some form of most of those, often different to the form in any other modern browser.<p>HTML5 video is a great example. It's a nice idea, but as long as everyone is having childish arguments over which formats they're going to support, many of us who have to produce real world applications for real world users are still going to use Flash. (Sorry, Apple.)<p>If and when the sorts of features you described are standardised such that web developers can write one version of their code and have a fair chance of it running on all modern browsers, then you'll have a case. Until then, I'm afraid it's just your personal, and inevitably biased, wish list.<p>> These are the features that let Web developers build a richer caliber of Web applications.<p>Can you give us some examples?<p>> IE 8 has none of this. IE 8 was really not much more than IE7 with improved CSS 2.1 support, and IE7 wasn't much more than IE6 with tabbed browsing.<p>Writing silly things like that makes you look rather foolish. For example, you've just defined ""super-fast JavaScript engines"" as a necessary criteria for a modern browser, and then immediately glossed over orders-of-magnitude improvements in real world JS performance between successive versions of IE. Of course faster JS engines are never going to do any harm, other things being equal, but IE8 runs JS fast enough to be useful.",1306065758

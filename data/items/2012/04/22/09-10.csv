I didn't feel the need to enumerate all of them.</i><p>How about just one then? I don't see a iOS-ification, I just see a cross-pollination of concepts. Haven't met many people who don't like full-screen apps for example, especially for certain tasks that require concentration, like writing, drawing, etc, even programming. Though, could a full-screen Emacs still be considered a full-screen ""app"" (full-screen OS?). I also like how I finally have one bloody view for both spaces AND ""expose"" that is convenient.<p><i>>Incidentally, Lion chugs resources when compared to the same exact hardware on Snow Leopard.</i><p>It seems like something that it's either obvious (say, a 20% slowdown), or something marginal that needs lotsa testing to find out. I haven't experienced anything of the former. As for the latter, do we have any numbers? At least, some benchmark run on the exact same machine, on a newly installed Snow Leopard AND Lion. This guys ran one, and it showed the exact same performance for both Snow Leopard and Lion, with marginal variation in different areas to one or the other. The more impressive gains were on the Lion side:<p><a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/4485/back-to-the-mac-os-x-107-lion-review/23"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/4485/back-to-the-mac-os-x-107-...</a><p>Same results as these guys:<p><a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20081987-1/snow-leopard-vs-lion-performance-head-to-head/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20081987-1/snow-leopard-...</a><p>So, no, ""Lion chugs resources"" sounds like a subjective unsubstantiated claim to me, as does every similar statements, whatever the OS or app, if it's not accompanied with numbers.<p>><i>I never said their direction was to chug resources -- I implied their new direction chugs resources, and it does.</i><p>This makes it sound like the ""chugging of resources"" is, if not the direction, as you say, an inherent attribute of the direction (i.e like with that direction it would be inevitable NOT to chug resources).<p>The numbers show that this is in fact not the case at all -- it does NOT chug resouces.<p>But even if it was, I wouldn't rush to call it an inherent attribute of the direction, but merely an accidental one, some bug or sloppy coding that introduced performance regressions and that can be fixed, whatever the direction.",1335088795

(Most people keep their phone in their pocket or purse, so this seems doable.)  A speaker embedded in your belt yells out step-by-step CPR instructions to the people around you.<p>- Your toothbrush takes your temperature and absorbs a sample of your saliva, which it analyzes for deviations from your long-term norm.  It uses wifi to upload this data to your computer, along with a map of the surfaces of the teeth you brushed.  The next time you use your computer, you'll see a visualization of your teeth; any surfaces which you missed when brushing are highlighted in red.  (e.g. if you aren't brushing behind your molars, then those areas are highlighted.)<p>- As you're driving, a sensor on your rearview mirror will detect if you fall asleep at the wheel (your eyelids close for more than one second) which triggers an audible alert to wake you.<p>I'd love to spend my life coming up with pragmatic ways to use technology to benefit your health / monitor for emergency conditions.

The ones who still insist on using a manual typewriter are eccentrics, or jerking your chain.<p>Manual typewriters were pigs. They take a lot of effort to operate and produce very uneven impressions on the page. Because it's a mechanical lever system, they have a very long key depression -- typically 2-3 centimetres. Ever trapped your pinkie under the (sharp) rim of an adjacent key? If you're not a <i>very</i> precise typist it happens every few minutes on a manual typewriter. Because of the effort involved in hammering the keys, and the fun of trying to clear the frequent key jams you experience if you type too fast -- the type arms need to have time between keystrokes in which to fall away from the platen; if you type too fast you end up jamming them together -- it's very difficult to attain the same typing speed on a manual typewriter as on an electric model of any kind (except for the early, insanely slow, daisy wheel machines) and you end up with sore, inky fingers.<p>NB: Your go-to reference for the history of typewriters is ""Century of the Typewriter"" by Wilfred A.

If someone has the ability and desire to work for a formal $30k salary then I don't begrudge them declaring what they can do on the cheap.<p>On the other hand, I roll my eyes when someone who spent 500 hours building an app says it's profitable because they have enough paying users to pay the server costs.",1335085555
3874381,comment,3873708,3873708,2,0,MortenK,,,"I've had a company incorporated in Hong Kong (HK) while living in Thailand, and a company incorporated in the British virgin isles (BVI) while living in Russia. These were both very small software development shops around 5 employees.<p>The cost of incorporation in both HK and BVI is around 2 to 4 thousand USD, if you pay a company to sort out all the paperwork, bank accounts etc. You also have to pay every year (roughly the same amount though a little less), to maintain the company. This again if you pay an agent company to take care of all the paperwork, which I'd highly recommend.<p>As for internet, both in Thailand and Russia it was absolutely fine for most purposes. You do have the occasional outage, but it's seldom. We did however have a backup 3G mobile internet line we used in these cases.<p>Whether or not you have to worry about handle physical mail, depends entirely on your business. We didn't have any use for it, but we were doing software so your mileage may vary. In most cases I'd think you'd be fine with a physical mail address in the US (or whereever your customers are), that can forward any mail to you.<p>As for tax, I wouldn't really know US rules - I formally emigrated from my home country, thereby making me tax exempt (but also non eligible to receive any services). Whether or not you need to pay personal income tax in your new country of residence, depends on the individual tax laws of the country. If you live like most expats do (on some form of a tourist visa), you usually don't pay tax there either. But you really should consult a local lawyer for details on this, as you generally do not want to risk breaking any laws in a country like Thailand or Cambodia.<p>As for corporate tax, this is zero percent if your company is incorporated in either HK or BVI. Heck, in BVI you don't even have to file annual accounting papers!<p>If you are curious we used www.ocra.com to incorporate in BVI and www.willsonn.com for incorporation in HK. Both of those companies can get the job done, but neither of them are very good at customer service. If I had to do it again, I'd probably look for a different agent.<p>Apart from that, there is really not much to it. Again depending on your situation, almost everything can be handled on telephone, email or fax (!).<p>Main issues are as others have mentioned:<p>You are far from family and friends.<p>You may have to do lots of expensive business travel.<p>It can be really hard to scale the business, unless you are able to work within a distributed team.",1335085506

Professional VC and backers know not every project ends up where you want. Not everyone succeeds. This way you lose a little money if it doesn't instead of a professional VC taking thousands on a flawed ide see groupon or pets.com. I doubt you would ever lose your shirt over a failed kickstart investment matter a fact backing for more than some extra money you have laying around complete defeats the purpose.",1335085480

A business model being legal and profitable does not make it ethical.<p>My understanding is, the <i>intention</i> behind society's laws and social norms is for all legal and profitable business models to serve the common good in some small way. What good do squatters do the world, in any way, shape, or form, whatsoever? The effect they have on the world is for good projects to be harder for people to use, by taking up all the good domains. That makes this a bug in our society, that I, at least, would appreciate being addressed.<p>If you register 10 domains and your project doesn't happen, don't put it on Sedo, let the domain expire like your project did. If you put the domain up for sale, you're already committing to not use the domain to ""someday"" finish your project.",1335085372

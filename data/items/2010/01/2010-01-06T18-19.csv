Just a few submissions in my years here. There is no front page sculpting among the top users here like on Digg. Edw and I actually talked about this in a mixergy interview we did with Andrew Warner.<p>Still, if there is something I really, really want to give a chance at getting on the front page, I will not feel bad about making sure it gets 2 or 3 points in the first couple minutes.   4 points would be too many. If it doesn't get any more upvotes, it will fall away quickly.<p>Since nickb and I upvoted stories that we felt were on-topic and deserving of being on the front page, where is the moral problem? And, if it is decided this is bad, how can it be stopped? Should you really only be able to upvote a friend's story if you innocently see it on the new page? Most people don't browse the new page, giving a small minority of users the power to choose what is seen by everyone else.<p>The supposed democracy of the new page is not something wonderful with this naive integrity we must maintain. It's a flawed system we have to work with. Asking friends to vote for your stories is a slippery slope, but when they are stories they would have upvoted anyways, there is no moral dilemna.

1035221,comment,1032209,1032956,0,0,dgordon,,,"Somehow go always makes its way into online conversations about chess.<p>The Wikipedia article on computer go suggests that humans are better at calculating long sequences in go than in chess because the pieces in go stay where they are unless they're captured.  This seems reasonable to me, though I'm no better than a beginner at go (I'm probably around the equivalent to an ""amateur low dan"" at chess, and can do what you suggested a go player of that level should be able to do in replaying and memorizing games.)<p>Also, it's not really fair to compare international titles in go, of which several are contested every year, to the world championship in chess, which is only contested every other year.  A better comparison might be some of the major international tournaments like Wijk aan Zee, Linares...or perhaps this year's Nanjing Pearl Spring tournament, in which Carlsen decisively defeated a field consisting of five other top-20 players: Veselin Topalov (currently world #2, and the challenger for the world championship to be held later this year), Wang Yue (#9), Peter Leko (#12), Teimour Radjabov (#16), and Dmitry Jakovenko (#19).  Carlsen scored 8/10 (six wins, four draws) -- no one else scored above 5.5/10.",1262800866

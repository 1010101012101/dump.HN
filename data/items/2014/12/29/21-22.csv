The reality is the whole &quot;fast food chains going healthy&quot; hype has died down almost completely and those succeeding in fast food now are the gourmet fast food shops that focus on delivering quality food (but definitely not healthy).<p>IMO McDonalds have excelled when it comes to Coffee and marketing the McCafe brand and I don&#x27;t doubt they could do the same thing with &quot;healthy food choices&quot; I just think the hype around healthy fast food has died for now and McDonalds is not willing to push it until the public demands it again.",1419890385

Most singulatarians I&#x27;ve hung out with place the locus-of-control in their story <i>internally</i>: they believe that, as a group, <i>they</i> will ensure that The Singularity comes to pass, in all its Charles-Strossian-weirdo-glory.  As detailed in the article, they have actual groups that are <i>trying to make this happen</i>.  They can be <i>incompetent</i> at it, but you can&#x27;t say they&#x27;re sitting around waiting for someone else to save them.<p>They&#x27;re more like Communists than Christians.<p>>the difference between this religion and other, older ones is that older religions focused on morality and human nature, while this one is not even about humans at all.<p>If you followed the article, the whole movement we&#x27;re talking about has a loud, public component called Effective Altruism who follow Peter Singer&#x27;s (noticeably Christlike, for all I&#x27;m not at all Christian) idea of giving away large portions of their personal income to the highest-impact disease-fighting and antipoverty charities operating in the Third World.  Extreme, impersonal charity might be <i>inhuman</i>, in some degree, but I&#x27;d be hard-pressed to call it either immoral or disconnected from moral concerns.<p>>The part about the guy weeping because previous generations didn&#x27;t have Kahneman was clearly written to reflect Christian sorrow for the generations prior to the coming of Christ<p>A guy wept because previous generations didn&#x27;t have Kahneman and Tversky&#x27;s foundational findings in behavioral economics?  Excuse the following several minutes of nonstop giggling.<p>Sorry, now, you&#x27;re telling me it&#x27;s patterned after some Christian thing?  I can&#x27;t really tell yes-or-no here, since I&#x27;ve got no background in Christianity.<p>>but the latter group is sad about those who didn&#x27;t hear Jesus&#x27;s message about kindness and love, while the former was crying about those who couldn&#x27;t tweak their minds to be more robot-like (not that he can, either, but at least he imagines he can).<p>Well, this provides a good opportunity to sum up, and to mention a couple of things.<p>Firstly, I too find it funny that people want to tweak themselves to better operate as fully, calculatively rational utility maximizers.  There&#x27;s a whole literature of bounded rationality showing that throwing out one&#x27;s information and computation bounds and <i>just</i> trying to approximate unbounded rationality in finite space is a <i>very bad idea</i> ;-)!<p>But secondly, just saying, if people once got sad about others not hearing Jesus&#x27;s message of kindness and love, well, what of these people and Peter Singer&#x27;s message of <i>realizing kindness and love in the here-and-now</i>?<p>Or, to get one level crazier, what of the people going to Secular Solstice and weeping that mankind has not yet defeated death, and that we will all lose our loved ones, suffer ourselves, and then die ourselves?  I rather imagine that the single fundamental fact of the human condition as we know it is an <i>entirely appropriate</i> target for religious yearnings!<p>The Buddha said, &quot;Existence is suffering.&quot;  The extropians said, &quot;Let&#x27;s fix that.&quot;  Disagree with their cause, or predict that they&#x27;ll fail, and we can converse sensibly about <i>why</i> they&#x27;re wrong.  Making fun of them for falling into the common psychological modes of religion, and I think you&#x27;re missing the big human-condition-shaped elephant in the room that simply isn&#x27;t going to go away.",1419890302

If you kick a programmer out of The Zone with a distraction, you can lose whole hours of useful productivity.<p>No sane manager is going to want to do that without a <i>really</i> good reason.<p>>programmers nearly always err on the side of too little communication<p>That&#x27;s because programmers like to be left in peace to work on small, relatively well-defined problems. Communication can be limited to progress and code reviews and goal-setting by team leaders. Everything else is noise.<p>The real problem with remote working is that too few corps understand it, and too many managers believe employees aren&#x27;t functional adults who can work without constant supervision.<p>It&#x27;s a management issue, not a programmer issue.<p>I think at some point we&#x27;re going to see some faddy Harvard Review type write a faddy Harvard Review type book about remote, and it&#x27;s suddenly going to become the new outsourcing. Because cheap.<p>But meanwhile - Paul Graham&#x27;s problem is that he has a nostalgic hankering for a vision of SV and start-up culture that&#x27;s already well on its way to being disrupted by the global talent he wants to move to the US.<p>If you&#x27;re a world-class five percenter, why on earth would you want to move somewhere with insane living expenses and in-bred VC culture of the Valley when you can bootstrap and innovate around it elsewhere?<p>Does he really believe all that funding and schmoozing and presentation is <i>essential</i> to getting a business up and running on a planet with an Internet?<p>Graham maybe needs to consider the possibility that those five percenters aren&#x27;t his future employees - they&#x27;re his future direct competitors.",1419890243
8812015,comment,8798800,8809571,0,0,code_duck,,,"What I mean is that while citizens are allowed to possess firearms, the government still has a monopoly on force. Attempting to actually use your firearms in someway unacceptable to them will almost certainly result in your doom. It&#x27;s sort of like mutually assured destruction, except it&#x27;s not mutual. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re worried about loose cannons holding grudges. While individual gun ownership is allowed, or tolerated, the government does not look kindly on forming militias.<p>If you ponder fictional police states such as 1984, in that situation it doesn&#x27;t really matter if the citizens have firearms as they&#x27;re thoroughly brainwashed that they would never use them. And, just like our world, if they did they would be brutally suppressed.<p>My opinion is that the people of the United States could not and would not stand up effectively to the National Guard, police and military if it came down to such a thing.",1419890237

I guess this dates me but instead of taking the legacy Z80 embedded micro controller class a long time ago, I took the then new brand new 68hc11 class, although the Z80 guys got to use two DACs and a scope to display a cube on the scope as one of their labs.  Now using a mhz class cpu to output a table at khz speeds isn&#x27;t very impressive, so logically the next step in the lab was rotating the cube.  I donno if they had to dream up their own trig or got a canned library.  Maybe they canned the whole thing and just stored 30 or so frames of rotation data and switched which frame they displayed every tenth of a second or whatever.  Donno didn&#x27;t take the class but we got to see their work on lab day.<p>I would imagine whatever took a &quot;sheet of paper&quot; sized development board with dedicated hardware DACs and eproms around 1990 could be done as a single chip solution today, assuming you can find a single chip solution that actually has two on board DACs.

I&#x27;d love work something related to space, or brains, or artificial intelligence, or something amazing.<p>There&#x27;s your first problem: looking for a meaningful existence in an activity that is also supposed to pay the mortgage. Good luck to you in making those two intersect. But look at what you&#x27;re asking in another way: &quot;I&#x27;d like to tie my identity to my vocation, but finding a vocation that allows that while supporting my &#x27;software money&#x27; lifestyle is difficult. What to do?&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve given up on doing that. I&#x27;m not saying everyone should, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But finding a job that gives me purpose and meaning in life, <i>and</i> pays six figures is fighting strong opposing odds. That&#x27;s fine, of the work I do I usually enjoy it even if I&#x27;m not finding the cure for cancer. If I had my way, I&#x27;d work full time at the NPO animal shelter I spend a lot of time at. But even the director (IOW, the big boss) only pulls down $65K a year. I&#x27;d settle for that, but I&#x27;m not getting her job anytime soon. The best I could probably do would be a little above minimum wage, and probably not 40 hours.<p>So what do I do? I work whatever software job keeps me interested and pays the bills. With the wheelbarrows of money that brings in, I donate to causes I feel should be supported. Sure, that might cut into my BMW M5 money but you don&#x27;t get your cake and eat it, too. I mean, what nobility is there in a job that pays the salary that many of have become accustomed to, and still allows us to feel that there&#x27;s &quot;meaning&quot; in our work? Where&#x27;s the sacrifice? Quit trying to tie the two together and you&#x27;ll get on much better, IMO. Sometimes the two coincide, most of the time they don&#x27;t; don&#x27;t force it.<p>I&#x27;m not just a checkbook volunteer, either. In the case of the animal shelter, I&#x27;ve logged over 200 volunteer hours this year. Though not a professional dog trainer (though at this point, going pro would merely involve a test and a few other hoops), I train dogs with behavior problems to make them more adoptable. Sometimes it&#x27;s not that glamorous: taking a stream of dogs out for a walk and picking up their shit. One after another, repeat for two hours. Am I changing the world? Depends on who you ask. The dog who came in a mental basket case who I trained to be a civilized member of society, and later got adopted, might argue that I may not have changed the world but I changed his world.<p>Meaningful volunteer opportunities abound. Coach a kids team. Help your local church&#x27;s homeless outreach. Whatever your &quot;thing&quot; is, there&#x27;s an organization that can put you to work. Sports, animals, computers, whatever. Personally speaking, I go home every time feeling like the world is just an eensy, weensy bit better due to my actions, rather that hoping we find that big breakthrough at work in a few years so it&#x27;ll all be worth it rather than just another day at the office.<p>> I probably just have it too good or I&#x27;m just meant to be miserable.<p>To use an over-used cliche: it&#x27;s definitely a first-world problem. Most people in the world go to work so that they and their children don&#x27;t starve and have to live on the streets. If we find meaning in it, we&#x27;re fortunate. For a large part of history the vast majority stayed one step ahead of the wolf by working whenever the sun was up.<p>I&#x27;ll close with this: if you think working on things that you classify as &quot;amazing&quot; or &quot;great&quot;, all while pulling down &#x27;software money&#x27;, is noble then I think you&#x27;re looking at it backwards and will never find satisfaction. Once you learn to see the greatness in picking up dog shit, for free, your answer will come to you much more quickly.",1419889762

I was working as backend developer and took the online course on Machine Learning on Coursera and realised that I want to work on Machine Learning in the future.<p>One of the myths is that you can learn to use toolkits and programming languages (R, Python) and become eligible for Machine Learning jobs (I certainly couldn&#x27;t).

Is it because of bugs in Julia related to global variables?<p>Mainly this; it&#x27;s incredibly easy to accidentally use global variables and swamp your whole program.  Think about defining some constant &quot;n&quot; in the global space and forgetting to put &quot;const&quot; in front of it.  Then any for loops that use &quot;for i = 1:n&quot; will reallocate n on every iteration.  If it&#x27;s a nested loop, you&#x27;ll get huge accidental memory allocations (this particular problem [not mine] is one on Stack Overflow that took a while to debug).<p>It&#x27;s the same reason garbage collection is used; it&#x27;s not <i>strictly</i> necessary but it prevents a lot of accidental bugs and makes programs easier to reason about.  I think it would be the same with removing global variables.<p>* Of course, you still want function names to be global, so perhaps define a namespace that you can dump immutable functions or constants into.  Or if there&#x27;s good reasons not to remove global variables, at least make them all const by default and add a &quot;mutable&quot; keyword (and maybe swap that in the REPL).  This would at least remove most of the accidental bugs.",1419889440

You are also dead wrong on syntax-rules/syntax-case capabilities, or maybe on what the syntax/AST is, if you think that there&#x27;s anything they can do that Nim can&#x27;t. Both systems deal with AST which means they both are unable to introduce new ways of parsing the code, only transform already parsed one. In (some) Scheme and Common Lisp you get access to readtable, which <i>is</i> the parser, but that&#x27;s really a different thing. And even in Lisps it&#x27;s not that popular: Clojure and Emacs Lisp disallow this for example.<p>Personally I favour pattern-based macros, like the ones implemented in Dylan, Elixir or Sweet.js (to show some non-sexp-based languages with such macros); but there is nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with procedural macros and they are not, in any way, less robust.<p>You don&#x27;t have to be excited by Nim, but you should try to avoid spreading lies just because you aren&#x27;t.

You do not need to deposit money with a third party site. Anyone can create a project, or pledge money to someone elses project and revoke that pledge before the project is claimed if they want the money back.<p>Unlike Kickstarter, there are no fees and it works in any country, although you do have to use Bitcoin so you are exposed to volatility and exchange fees (if your costs are in some other currency which is quite likely).<p>Over time I expect and hope that volatility will slowly decrease, and there are lots of ways to optimise currency exchange fees. So whilst this is somewhat exploratory today, I hope it can grow into a real competitor over the long run (5-10 years).<p><a href=""http://blog.vinumeris.com/2014/09/12/lighthouse-alpha-now-open-source/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.vinumeris.com/2014/09/12/lighthouse-alpha-now-op...</a>",1419888681

A percentage of those people will be great programmers.<p>Grouping great programmers together gives them a tiny, tiny, <i>tiny</i> chance at large rewards.  It&#x27;s a gigantic risk.  People aren&#x27;t stupid.  Most go to paths with less risk. The market has corrected itself. It attracts people in a manner appropriate to its risk/reward equation.<p>The way to reduce that risk is to provide more guaranteed rewards. Which means more compensation.  Which means transferring more of that unused capital sitting around in VC accounts to the great programmers. Which means the limiting factor is the capital put into the system.<p>Absent some big payday from a startup, which is a roll of the dice not in their favor, programmer compensation is low relative to other, much less risky career paths. If the field truly wants to attract the best and brightest, it&#x27;s got to offer a lot more rewards.<p>How much of a reward are &quot;great programmers&quot; 71-100 that company needed in pg&#x27;s example going to get, anyway? How huge a success does the company have to be for someone that far down the line to come out way ahead?

So how do we know extrinsic doesn&#x27;t work? We&#x27;re not trying it.<p>It&#x27;s ludicrous to think we have all the great programmers we could have.

For example you can build a mini quadcopter (size of a bird) weighing 5-800gms that can provide 2+KG of thrust. Back of the napkin math says a 400gm m67 grenade is easily within the payload capacity (Assuming 70% throttle to hover all up payload would be 1400+-gms). I would be very impressed if this could differentiate &quot;bird sized flying objects&quot; from birds. With that in mind I think we can be glad that complicated plots of that nature stay in the realm of James Bond rather then reality.

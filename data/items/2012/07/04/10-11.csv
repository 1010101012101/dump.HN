I've never even noticed the gender of someone contributing an article. Who are these people who tally these things up?<p>Anextio was pointing out the the tech industry is sexist, not trying to call <i>you</i> in particular sexist. It's cool that you make no assumptions if that's the case (although, to be honest I find that a bit unbelievable since you think the tech industry doesn't suffer from sexism), but that doesn't change the tech industry.<p>> And you call me sexist? And how do you know if the author is male or female anyway?<p>There are links (e.g. <a href=""http://blogs.perl.org/users/steven_haryanto/2012/07/so-apparently-this-is-creepy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.perl.org/users/steven_haryanto/2012/07/so-appar...</a>) that show that the author is male.<p>> You are aware that discriminating for women on good things is just as sexist as doing it for bad things, right?<p>I don't see where you got the idea that anextio was doing anything other than pointing out that women in the tech community don't get the credit they deserve.<p>> Because that's how English grammar works.<p>So it's suddenly not sexist to assume that the author of an anonymous blog is male? (Just to clarify: I don't mean sexist as in 'I'm out to systematically repress all women!', I mean the follow-the-leader sexist as in 'it's okay to x because everyone else does it.') 'He', unfortunately, isn't a gender-neutral pronoun.<p>> I don't get why gender even matters for these topics.

For instance, your enjoyment levels of a piece of software bares no correlation to the sex of the developer who created it.<p>This is in contrast to works where the sex of the author can have an impact on the overall enjoyment.<p>For example, I have playlists with over 100 female artists... because sometimes I do just want to listen to a female singer. My ""database"" of female singers in the form of a playlist isn't creepy, but a database of female developers could quite easily be considered so, since for the most part it's hard to think why anyone would need this information.

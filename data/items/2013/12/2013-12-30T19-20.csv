6986524,comment,6985207,6985674,9,0,zackmorris,,,"I just want to chime in and say that Apple has done an abysmal job with backward compatibility, and it&#x27;s not just due to the enterprise vs consumer market. I would wager that if you looked at the total list of apps ever released for Mac OS, the majority of them would not run today. That&#x27;s because Apple&#x27;s primary strategies are 1) innovate and 2) put the user first. Putting the developer first is not part of their profit motive like it would be for say Oracle or MathWorks. So without constant recurring effort, developers and the apps they create get left behind.<p>Apple frequently deprecates APIs that they endorsed just a few years ago. And they claim that apps can be rewritten to work with new APIs in a few hours, when in reality it can take weeks, months or even longer due to refactoring issues. If you want to be an Apple developer, you will likely be rewriting a portion of your code at some point to run on a new OS release. I was optimistic that the practice might end but history is already repeating itself with Apple insisting on iOS 7 compliance. The kicker is that Apple could have ported a lightweight version of Mac OS to run directly on arm for iOS, but they didn&#x27;t, and I disagree with it being a performance issue (iPads are orders of magnitude more powerful than NeXT machines, or even the early PowerPCs that ran OS X). They created a vast array of nearly duplicate code prefixed with UI instead of NS. This looks like more of an anachronism every day to me with tablets running at multiple GHz with GBs of ram, when the only major difference between desktop and mobile is the touch interface.<p>Contrast this with Microsoft, where I am finding very old examples designed for Windows XP that still run today. Now Microsoft is certainly burning its developers with the major breaks in various versions of DirectX, or subtle differences in APIs between desktop/mobile/Xbox, but in my opinion this isn&#x27;t happening nearly to the extent that it is with Apple.",1388433526

We start by finding the cost of the best possible path.  Set k=1 and ask if there&#x27;s a solution.  If not, double K and ask again.  Repeat until the answer is &quot;Yes&quot;.<p>Now you know there is a solution with cost in the range [0,K].  Set L=0 and U=K.  Now do a binary search.

Thousands of people cross the straight between England and France everyday, but when someone swims across it makes the news. Thousands of people skydive everyday, but when Felix Baumgartner jumped from higher and faster than anybody before it made the news.

Seems totally reasonable if it reduces the chances of letting someone dangerous on a plane with you. You wait in line for hours for a lot of ridiculous things like black friday shopping, a particularly crowded fast food joint, buying the latest and greatest iPhone (or other tech gadget). Waiting in line a little bit longer just to make the plane more safe than not is NOT A BAD DEAL! As for the privacy issue, yes it does suck to be patted down or have to walk through a body scan. But honestly, grow a pair and just walk through the damn thing. I have never felt harassed by a TSA agent and I&#x27;ve had the &quot;lovely&quot; experience of both a body scan and a pat-down...

Otherwise, feel free to use Python 3.<p>This effectively means that only for purely greenfield projects for machines under your team&#x27;s control and possibly even new teams can Py3 be used confidently. It&#x27;s a shame - there are a number of nifty cleanups in Py3, but I simply don&#x27;t see a compelling reason to use Py3 over Py2.  This is particularly true given PyPy being fast and Py2.

I mostly agree and I also don&#x27;t think that saving 10 minutes over the course of a month or a year can be directly translated into 10 minutes of work (as it could be with a computer). I think the value of small efficiency boosts is two-fold: first, they compound. Saving a minute on twenty daily tasks gives you twenty minutes of extra time to do something. You could spend that time sleeping or coding or watching TV, but at least you have a choice. So maybe that 10 minutes saved would only produce 3 minutes of additional productive/non-&quot;wasted&quot; time, but that&#x27; still something.<p>The second value is that while one minute is not significant in the course of a day or a week, it can be significant in the course of a single task. For example, until fairly recently, you could get your bank balance in person or over the phone. The former might be a 10-minute task while the latter might take 3 minutes. However, now you can check your balance in seconds via a website or a mobile app. Even though you might checking your balance once a week or once a month, the thought of spending seconds on a task that normally takes minutes is very appealing. If banks only offered balance info via phone, that would be a large inefficiency and a great business opportunity (perhaps for a company like Mint)",1388431526

Either some kind of lockless list or pre thread pools.<p>Now lets talk about 3rd party code. If you have a 3rd party library that internally uses TLS and you swap its context onto a different thread it&#x27;s bound to misbehave and when it does it&#x27;s usually subtle and hard to debug. So if you&#x27;re using 3rd party libraries you either have to audit them (and make sure you didn&#x27;t miss anything), disable context migration (and risk unbalanced workloads) or have a separate scheduler that only runs those tasks. Pick your poison.<p>It doesn&#x27;t even have to be 3rd party code that miss behaves when green threads are migrated. I pulled out my hair for a couple weeks trying to debug an issue with a call to accept(). It was returning -1 but errno was set to 0. What gives? Well it turns out that on linux in glibc errno is a macro, that calls a function to get the address for errno for your thread. And that function is marked with the gcc __attribute__((pure)). So what it means that once the address of errno is calculated once in the body of the function the compiler is free to assume it&#x27;ll always be that address (it&#x27;s a pure function without side effects). Here&#x27;s the sequence:<p>1. accept() == -1\n2. errno == EAGAIN\n4. errno = 0\n3. scheduler_yield()\n5. accept() == -1\n6. errno == 0 (although it should be something else)<p>This will happen on Linux with glibc if your scheduler_yield() call returns but is running on a different thread when it returns. So even your own innocent code that doesn&#x27;t use TLS can break in interesting ways.<p>If you have very small green threads and you have a naive stealing scheduler with a mutex you can be sure that you&#x27;ll be spending significant on synchronization. You can get fancies with non-blocking queues and atomic instructions to overcome this.<p>I did have multiple schedulers for both CPU bound tasks and IO bound tasks. I would say that that if you&#x27;re doing disk IO and you&#x27;re just forwarding the data (versus having to process it) you&#x27;re better of with non-blocking sendfile() or non-blocking vmsplice() (plus mmap) in your event loop. If you&#x27;re doing lots of disk IO on a SSD array that can push 2GB/s you&#x27;re going to needs lots of IO threads the latency of the message passing between the two scheduler is going to add up. Again this may or may not be problem in your application.<p>Those are some of my own experiences, they may or may not apply to you but I hope it helps.",1388430478

When I&#x27;m done, I&#x27;m &quot;in a good way&quot; tired and my mind is sharper.<p>A little over a year ago, I started stretching every morning, slowly and gently, as part of my shower routine (shave, shower, stretch sort of thing).<p>A few months ago, I integrated strength exercises. I started with squats, just squats. After less than a month, the nascent roundness had left my face, my pants were less snug around my thighs, the overall layer of bacon wrapping was dropping away; I still have a little belly, but I&#x27;m 48 - a friend of the same age runs marathons and has a slight paunch.<p>After a bit, I started doing push-ups, chin-ups, etc., a little bit here and there. GAH! It was hard.<p>Now a complete routine, done once-a-weekish, is 3 rounds of PCLPDS: Pull-ups (wide; x10), Crunches (x20), Lunges (x20), Push-ups (narrow, x10), Deadlifts (x20), Squats (x20).<p>Most days I&#x27;ll work intensely where I feel I need to (I&#x27;ve developed pretty good body awareness over the last 15 years, so I pay attention to it). The last couple of days has been arms and chest; this morning was 20 wide push-ups and 10 wide pull-ups, moderately quickly, 10 normal push-ups and 8 &quot;normal&quot; chin-ups, both more slowly, then a break (trimmed my nails, shaved), then another round of 20, 8, 10, and 7, respectively.<p>Tomorrow will probably be 2-3 rounds of squats, deadlifts, and lunges, with some crunches at the end, and a break the next day.<p>Make it routine. It&#x27;s amazing the effect exercise has if you stick to it. It took very little time to drop from 190 to 180, and now I&#x27;m slowly over 190 again, heavier than I&#x27;ve ever been, but with less fat and something I never, ever imagined I&#x27;d have: A chest. And muscular arms. And those muscles all around the armpit. Looking in the mirror when I get out of the shower is a nice ego boost.<p>Not to mention that I can move more easily, I have far less stiffness, practically no back pain - for a 48 year old guy who just two years had a back episode so bad it took 10 minutes to get out of bed (by which I mean rolling onto the floor on hands and knees, wondering for the life of my how I was going to make it onto the toilet), this is fantastic!",1388430029

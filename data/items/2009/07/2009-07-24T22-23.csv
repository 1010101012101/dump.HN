Whenever I hear about some potentially useful-to-me 0.1-version OS project, it'd be nice to know things about it.  Things like, ""Is the developer ever going to spend more than that first weekend poking at it?"" or ""Does the developer think of this code as similar to a discarded toilet he's left on a curb?""<p>I get the point about entitled-feeling users, but there's a flip side: in the comments, he goes on about welcoming bug reports, etc. from those users.  He wants users to bug-test for him and help him improve his code, but he's not paying them for the QC work any more than they're paying him for coding.<p>If you release software, for better or worse, you set up some social expectations.  If you don't want people complaining to you and wanting bug-fixes and support, either <i>don't release that software</i> or make it abundantly clear in the license, download site, etc. that the software isn't supported.",1248476335

I know I have something of a barrier to entry for customers;  if you can't figure out how to use an OpenSSH public key to authenticate your access to a serial console, I refer you to linode or slicehost.  I freely admit I am unprepared to support those users, and probably could not do so at my current prices.  And my competitors are good;  I haven't heard anything bad about either one.<p>Sure, I could have more customers if I had an easier way to control your VPS than a ssh-based console, but at what cost?  People who know Linux are pretty easy to support, once you give them (standard linux) tools.   There are enough people who understand (sometimes even prefer)  the standard linux tools to a web interface to support my business, so I say, why not offer them a service at a price that reflects the lower cost of supporting those users?<p>(right now my big problem is provisioning;  that is, if you want to add services, you need to wait for an employee of prgmr.com to help.  But most everything else, the user can do without my help.)<p>I think forcing your support people to stay on the line with rude or difficult customers is a good way to burn out your support people.   I think having a liberal but well-defined money back guarantee makes doing support quite a bit easier.    Keeping good customer support people is <i>hard</i>  -  I think losing the most difficult 2% of customers is a small price to pay to keep good support people for the rest of your customers.

I guess a few folks are angry about having their business model attacked with reality.<p>Addressing your post:  Software isn't a car and the marginal cost to manufacture more software licenses is zero.

Pitted against that means of generating revenue, a service company giving away its product is going to lose in the long-run every time.<p>To see this, just look at the software marketplace:  Aside from the solitary black-swan exception of RedHat (which arguably sells licenses instead of services anyhow), where are the profitable open source support contract companies?<p>I can spool up 3,000 software licenses sold today without batting an eye (and add in support charges on top of that if needed) making a ton of cash with which to hire employees for product improvement, but 3,000 hours of support is a huge cost requiring a great many employees to manage before even a penny of profit is obtained.<p>Bringing this back to my original point:  Commercial software companies can easily dominate 'free' open source alternatives given that reality, so they can safely ignore their free 'competition'.",1248474474

722554,comment,722294,722403,0,0,anupj,,,"I think Palm Pre is concerned more about its users, whereas apple is obsessed with it's software and hardware. Everyone knows that interoperability is a great thing to have, but nobody wants their competitor(Palm Pre et al) to benefit from the technology that they(Apple) has pioneered and improved for years. 
Think of it this way. Imagine a world where Palm Pre is invented before iPhone, and there is PreTunes software which is the most popular music/app store in the world. Then Apple launches iPhone, do you think Apple would try to make iPhone compatible with the hypothetical 'PreTunes'? or more importantly: Would Palm stop iPhone from being used via PreTunes? The answer is probably 'Yes'.",1248473486

You may want to go to the dealership and just buy one (Toyota's automated process, thus lowering marginal cost). However, maybe you're the hotrod type and would rather build it and customize it yourself. You pay for someone to help you build it and troubleshoot any mistakes you make along the way. Sure, it took longer to build, and was probably more expensive, but it's exactly want you wanted. I think that's where the value of opensource/support lies.<p>Commercial open source companies (at least Redhat) use subscription models for their support (in addition to consulting, professional QA, etc) so I don't think they would consider troubleshooting software money earned. In fact, I think this gives them a greater incentive to maintain the quality of their software so they get less support tickets and scale to have more subscription fees per support person. I guess you can say that RedHat, through their support, sells the peace of mind of having that support person if you want to go the open source route.",1248473084

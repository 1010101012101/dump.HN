I found the disconnect between IB and XCode the most difficult thing about it, it's like there was another layer of programming you couldn't see immediately (the connections) which made it harder to slip back into a project if you hadn't touched it for a while. Not to mention the fact that every time I picked up this project (it's an after hours thing that I don't get a lot of time to play around on) I would almost have to re-read a tutorial to remember how all the connections, etc. worked in IB. I think the main problem really was the disconnect though, so I'm looking forward to actually having everything <i>there</i>.<p>So, when will it be done? :D",1279867721

1540535,comment,1540417,1540417,0,0,koevet,,,"I have worked in Nokia as consultant for almost a year and I have always wondered how Nokia became Nokia, given they way they managed software development internally. 
Several consultancy companies were working on the same project - a communication nightmare and developers with little or no experience were brought on board.
But, as the book suggests, the main issue was coming from the Nokia managers involved in the project. They were absolutely unable to manage and run a large scale software development project and, above all, they weren't able to take any decision, a complete, terrified paralysis.
Not sure how they ended up being like that, the Peter principle is likely one of the causes. 
I hope Nokia gets back on their feet, they surely have a massive technological asset and they can bring innovation to the telco world.",1279867512

1540518,comment,1540136,1540469,0,0,justsee,,,"That is exactly what Penrose demonstrates in his book - within mathematics there are things that cannot be calculated algorithmically. Which is also why the above summary makes the point that this simple argument is devastating (for proponents of Strong AI).<p>A summary of his position can be found on his Wikipedia page:
""He claims that the present computer is unable to have intelligence because it is an algorithmically deterministic system. He argues against the viewpoint that the rational processes of the mind are completely algorithmic and can thus be duplicated by a sufficiently complex computer. This contrasts with supporters of strong artificial intelligence, who contend that thought can be simulated algorithmically. He bases this on claims that consciousness transcends formal logic because things such as the insolubility of the halting problem and Gödel's incompleteness theorem prevent an algorithmically based system of logic from reproducing such traits of human intelligence as mathematical insight.""<p>I searched for some decent refutations by Minsky, and was disappointed to only find this: <a href=""http://kuoi.com/~kamikaze/doc/minsky.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kuoi.com/~kamikaze/doc/minsky.html</a>

XX is a ripoff"" posts are we going to see?<p>If you pay for a good transcoding service, you're not just paying for being able to run FFMPEG. That's the easy part. The hard part is dealing with thousands of combinations of audio and video codecs, containers, pixel and display aspect ratios, handling improperly encoded files and optimizing to produce the best quality at a given size. There's a reason entire companies are based on being good at these things, and people are willing to pay for it. This is not trivial stuff.<p>I'm not knocking the PiCloud product at all, as there are certainly some limited use cases where it would fit nicely and get the job done cheaply.

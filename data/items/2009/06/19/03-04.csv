He had no problem playing games that would be hard for a 3.5 yr old with a mouse.  May not sound like much, but a year at that age is huge, and even at 4, as the article states, kids are just barely getting the hang of a mouse.  By 4, our kid was a mouse jockey.  Transitioning from touchscreen to mouse was trivial.",1245383575

664625,comment,664587,664587,0,0,jsz0,,,"I think it's a bit lazy on Palm's part to rely on Apple for this functionality. I've seen other syncing apps that simply read the iTunes library XML and serve the same purpose in the end. Seems like a more sustainable way of ensuring the functionality will continue to work as advertised. Palm's method is a bit reckless but in the end it may be in Apple's best interest to just ignore it. Anyone who is super concerned about syncing natively in the iTunes application is probably more than happy to buy an iPhone so what is the impact? Not much.<p>On an unrelated note I wonder how long Pre can hold out at $200/8GB and have any hope of competing with the 3GS/16GB and $99/3G.",1245383401

664615,comment,663662,664591,0,0,xenophanes,,,"In chapter 12 Kuhn mistakenly says that Popper is seeking falsifications that <i>necessitate</i> the rejection of a theory. He then points out that falsifications are imperfect, so that is problematic. That criticism would be correct, but Popper is not seeking to <i>necessitate</i> the rejection of any theory. Popper is a fallibilist who does not seek perfect or final falsifications, nor does he seek to justify or prove falsifications. So in short, Kuhn says there are certain difficulties, which he is correct about, and he says Popper's theory faces them, which he has wrong on account of misunderstanding Popper's theory. BTW Popper was aware of the same difficulties Kuhn brings up, and sometimes uses them in his arguments (they are not problematic for Popper's <i>conjectural knowledge</i> approach, but they are problematic for many other approaches).<p>In the postscript section 5, Kuhn says communication is always partial, so in a debate we can never prove the other guy is wrong in a way he must accept. This is the same sort of thing as before, and it is basically correct, but Popper is aware of it and his theories are compatible with it. One way Popper and Kuhn do contradict in this arena is about how valuable partial communication is. Kuhn is pessimistic about partial communication across paradigms, but Popper is more optimistic and says by an effort we can learn from each other even across paradigms/cultures/frameworks (see Popper's _The Myth of the Framework_, title essay).<p>I looked through ch8 also, but didn't spot any criticism of Popper's falsificationism. If you are still convinced it is there, please explain it in your own words or site specific paragraphs.<p>PS regarding justificationism, the prevailing idea of knowledge is that it is <i>justified</i> true belief. This can be found in the dictionary or any intro philosophy textbook.<p>PPS It is unfortunate that PG's nested thread rate limiting is hiding the reply link on this comment. I think this is a perfectly good, respectful thread. So it's collateral damage? :(",1245382892

It is difficult for faculty and staff to perform even the most basic functions, such as hiring, purchasing, tracking and managing multiple budgets, and making accurate budget projections.<p>The systems lack basic tools and functionality to help staff do their work, such as controls to prevent over-spending, visibility into pending financial transactions, or ability to do financial reporting at the unit or department level. The systems do not collect the level and detail of data required to meet the UW’s growing information needs.<p>As a result, staff must engage in “daily heroics” just to keep business operations running and get the information they need to do their jobs. They must make extraordinary efforts to perform basic job duties, employing numerous manual workarounds and engaging in other cumbersome and time-consuming processes that take away from higher-level work.<p>To compensate for missing functionality, departments and units across the University have created hundreds of shadow systems at considerable cost and effort.

The easiest, by far.</i><p>I don't know if I'd go that far, but of the 30 or so subsystems we sell our customers, I'd put it in the easiest 5 or so.<p>Here are some factors that make it easy:<p>1)  The underlying domain model is well understood and has been for decades.  Employee works for you.  You pay them wages and benefits, set aside taxes, and mark that you did so.  Periodically you export your records to show people.  Changes in the overall procedure practically never happen.   Changes at the data level happen all the freaking time but, hey, computers tolerate data changing pretty well.<p>2)  The users of the system are all experts.  They should be, using the payroll system <i>is</i> their job.  They have a high tolerance for complicated workflows and will never push a button just to see what it does.<p>3)  Performance demands on a payroll system would be rounding error on any other system in the enterprise.  Even with 60k employees you have, hmm, a few dozen payroll clerks, if that?  Changes take weeks to propagate anyhow, so if a report isn't quite up-to-the-nanosecond you don't have to sweat it.<p>4)  I am not speaking about my employers or my employers' customers: many enterprises <i>do not want</i> fantastic payroll systems.  If it has a little black magic involved and some sharp edges, that suits the payroll clerks perfectly fine.  After all, that means there will always need to be payroll clerks who know about those little usage niggles.",1245380994

He was VP at a Canadian subsidiary of a 50 year old American construction company that had been run into the ground by 20 something lawyers/entrepreneurs/whizkids. When the parent company entered chapter 11, he and a couple of the other employees at the Canadian subsidiary got a loan from the bank, got access to the construction equipment of the bankrupt company, and took over the government contracts that were the bread and butter of the now bankrupt company.

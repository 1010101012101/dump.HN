272225,comment,271680,271894,0,0,dkokelley,,,"What about for opposing lanes? A wreck going the other way is still a sight and both directions will slow to sneak a peek.<p>The article also mentioned that because of the spectacle, drivers are paying less attention to the road and looking at the wreck, causing secondary accidents.<p>Then again, a tarp with emergency vehicles is another reason for drivers to slow down and look at something, according to the article. The trick is to find something so mundane that drivers won't bother slowing down.",1218351233

We're already great at ignoring billboards and other ads.<p>Then again... because so many people take the time to slow down and look at the wrecks, why not take advantage of the extra eyeballs and put up signs with ads on them?",1218351029
272223,comment,271680,272024,0,0,dkokelley,,,"The real problem is that a lot of people drive on the same roads at the same time. What they're doing on the roads is irrelevant (although work is probably the biggest cause of the demand for road usage. I assume you're attempting to make a case for staggering work hours so ""rush hour"" is spread over a longer time).<p>Roads are an interesting economic model. There are basically 3 primary factors: current demand, current supply, and <i>price</i>. Price is especially interesting because price isn't necessarily dollars (or your currency of choice).<p>Price = Demand/Supply<p>So if demand goes up (rush hour, popular events, etc.) or supply goes down (construction, accidents blocking lanes) then the price goes up. Part of the price is paid in taxes that goes to build and maintain the road, the other component of price is time. How much time will you spend driving. If it's rush hour and there was a collision blocking the left lane and you're on your way to a baseball game then the demand is pretty high, and the supply is pretty low, so the price will go up. If this isn't a toll road, then the additional price you're paying is 100% time. Of course the beauty is that you could in theory take a toll road and pay in currency instead of time, although there aren't always toll roads as options.<p><sarcasm>\nI suppose the best solution is A: don't go anywhere, or B: get a transporter like in Star Trek.</sarcasm>",1218350799

272210,comment,271437,271559,0,0,silencio,,,"> custom color lid? who cares?<p>I care. I have to use the machine(s) every single day, sometimes for hours on end. If it's ugly, I don't want to look at it. Same goes for accessories. It's impossible to find a half decent non-black or pink womens laptop bag (I believe there's a special and separate level of hell just for the color pink, that's how much I hate it). I just stick with nondescript messenger bags, which don't always fit the occasion but oh well.<p>My black MacBook has an engraved lid (<a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/chix0r/2490375769/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flickr.com/photos/chix0r/2490375769/</a>). The biggest benefit is that it sticks out like a sore thumb so I know it's mine, since so many people don't do <i>anything</i> to their MacBooks after getting one. Very convenient when you're in a sea of Apple laptops..which used to happen to me at WWDC but now also happens at pretty much any tech conference nowadays.<p>It also makes a great conversation starter with lots of people who are very tempted to touch it..everywhere from airport security waiting lines to the apple store and all.",1218349729

272208,comment,271677,271840,0,0,noonespecial,,,"You might actually get downmodded here for not explaining <i>why</i> you think the Zune is crap. Lots of people here agree, but just saying ""Its crap"" might cause some with long memories to recall the ""Scottish Store"" skit on SNL but won't add anything to the discussion.<p>I personally found that although the Zune had some compelling features that might have caused me to overlook its clunky form factor, each of those features had some artificial restriction placed on them that made them not useful in real life.<p>For the record, I do not own an Apple player either. My ""mp3 player"" is a whole <i>box</i> of tiny vaguely shuffle-like 1Gb mini players I got as a lot on ebay. They worked out to be $7 each and I got 20 of them. I gave some to my friends with ""mix tapes"" on them and filled a bunch of the others with various collections. I never worry about losing them and just grab the one with the tunes I'm in the mood for on my way out. They came in multiple colors so I didn't even bother labeling them. I did spring for a nice pair of headphones. The players actually sound much better than you might expect.",1218349127

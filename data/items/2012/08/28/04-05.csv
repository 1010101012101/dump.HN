4442218,comment,4440143,4442068,1,0,dougmccune,,,"I get that the claims of patents are supposedly very specific, and what I'm asking is if someone can actually explain why and how this particular patent has anything non-obvious in its claims (without all the ridiculous patent jargon).<p>I've just read claim 19 about 5 times. I also studied Figure 5, which seems to lay out the process in a way that's a little easier to understand.<p>I have absolutely no idea how what is described in claim 19 is not the ""idea"" of inertial/bounce-back scrolling.<p>As far as I can understand, the layperson's explanation of claim 19 goes something like this: drag some content on a touchscreen at the speed that the dragging finger is moving, once you hit the end of the scrollable range, start slowing down the speed at which the item moves, and show a different background to make it clear you've reached the end of the list, once the finger releases move the list back into place.<p>I'm trying sentence by sentence to translate the words in the patent claim to english that I can understand. And it sounds to me like this is the general idea of this method of scrolling. There are no specifics, no specific easing algorithms, no specific method of tracking the finger's movement, no method of actually implementing this at all.",1346129957

Instead of poking holes in bad word choices or minor factual inaccuracies, reconstruct in your head the person's argument to be as strong and clear-headed as possible. Then refute <i>that</i> argument, which is probably closer anyways to what the person was thinking than what they actually wrote.<p>Going all out against someone's point of view does have its uses, of course.

4442208,comment,4441734,4441981,17,0,tikhonj,,,"I think pointing out a logical fallacy is not a refutation. Rather than saying ""your argument is wrong"", it says ""your argument is not well-formed"". This is much like the difference between a program that has a bug and a program that has a parse error.<p>To take the most glaring example: ""my point is true because my point is true"". Obviously, nobody actually says this seriously. But some arguments <i>are</i> isomorphic to this. And any argument like that is not wrong <i>per se</i>--it is literally meaningless.<p>Other fallacies are more subtle and complicated, but the idea remains the same: using a fallacy does not invalidate your point but merely renders your argument meaningless. I can say that ""the sky is blue because everybody says so"" and I would not be wrong--given the sky is actually blue, of course--but the argument would still be a fallacy. I think to point this out is valuable even (perhaps <i>especially</i>) if you do <i>not</i> disagree with the point in question.",1346129661

Suppose also that the direct risk-corrected value of the plane, even excluding passenger lives, also exceeds the price the terrorist is asking for. We still make it policy not to negotiate with the terrorist, because doing so would create a positive feedback loop that pushes us down a slippery slope.<p>When you think about it, it's a fairly insidious argument to say that slippery slope arguments should be rejected because they fall into a category of arguments that are subtle and hard to refute because they are so insidious. An amusing implied prior of the slippery slope fallacy is that once we start accepting valid slippery slope arguments, what's to stop us from accepting the really terrible ones that take the same structure?",1346129347

I can prototype. But at some point I need to add in artists and designers at which point it will be months till I have anything close to Unreal or Unity.<p>But I don't know Unity or Unreal so I stick with C/C++/DirectX and then hit that wall.<p>I assume the same is true for other areas. I could write webapp in cgi/perl/html/js or cgi/python/html/js or php/html/js those are what I know. But if I chose Rails or insert-framework-of-the-month-here I'd gain so much functionality.<p>Back to games. I could hack an iOS game together in ObjectiveC/C++ or I could choose a framework and get free server side highscores, free in app purchase framework, free social network integration, etc... etc... etc...<p>So yes, you can fail because you never take the first step. But you can also fail because you don't realize that the few hours it takes to make a working prototype is actually only 1% of the work you have to do to ship and that if you'd have chosen a framework/engine you'd start at the 50% or 75% mark instead of the 0% mark.",1346129192

This week, we are excited to share with you some important Diaspora announcements.<p>When we started Diaspora two years ago, the project kicked off with amazing reception and support from people that believed in our ultimate goal: giving users ownership over their data. It's a powerful idea, one that captured the imaginations of millions of people across the world. This vision has expanded and evolved over the past two years that we have been working on it as the project has grown.<p>Diaspora* began when we were still at NYUjust four guys trying to scratch our own itch. We had an idea about how social networks could work in a new and exciting way. We intended to be done over the course of a summer, and with an expected budget of $10,000 from our Kickstarter campaign. The reception of this idea was so good that we managed to reach 20 times the expected amount in donations, and the project expanded to cover far more than just a summer. It's been over two years now, and we are proud of what Diaspora has become.<p>Today, the network has grown into thousands of people using our software in hundreds of installations across the web. There are hundreds of pods that have been created by community members, and it has become one of the biggest Github projects to date. It has been translated to almost fifty languages, with hundreds of developers worldwide contributing back to the project.<p>Diaspora has grown into something more than just a project four guys started in their office at school. It is bigger than any one of us, the money we raised, or the code we have written. It has developed into something that people all over the world care about and are inspired by.  We think the time is right to reflect this reality, and put our code where our hearts lie.<p>Today, we are giving control of Diaspora to the community.<p>As a Free Software social project, we have an obligation to take this project further, for the good of the community that revolves around it. Putting the decisions for the projects future in the hands of the community is one of the highest benefits of any FOSS project, and wed like to bring this benefit to our users and developers. We still will remain as an important part this community as the founders, but we want to make sure we are including all of the people who care about Diaspora and want to see it succeed well into the future.<p>If you look around, youll see that weve made an effort to open up to the community more to help better serve it. Weve opened up our Pivotal Tracker for community developers help join in (You can sign up here), weve launched a tool that deploys one-click installations to the Heroku app hosting service, and weve updated joindiaspora.com to be more community-centric, showcasing other pods a user can join.<p>This will not be an immediate shift over. Many details still need to be stepped through. It is going to be a gradual process to open up more and more to community governance over time. The goal is to make this an entirely community-driven and community-run project. Sean Tilley, our Open Source Community Manager will spearhead community efforts to see that this happens.  Stay tuned to our blog for a message from Sean concerning next steps, as well as ways to get involved in helping with the transition process.<p>This is a new opportunity for Diaspora to grow further than ever before.  We cant wait to see what we can do together.<p>Daniel and Maxwell<p>PS. We also want to give special thanks to a few people who recently, and over the past few years, have shown us what a special community we have. It is by no means complete:\nMr ZYX, sean tilley, David Morley, Jan-Christoph Borchardt, Joe Braun, David Morley, Hans Fase, Florian Staudacher, Movilla, Stephan Schulz, Sarah Mei, Tom Scott, kinky joe, denschub, justin thomas, Steven Hancock, Diasp, Jason Robinson",1346128459

Patents are supposed to be an exchange where an inventor gets a temporary monopoly while the public gets instructions for implementing a new and non-obvious ""process, machine, article of manufacture, or composition of matter"". You can't seriously argue that the world needed the bounce-back, data detector, or universal search patents to figure out how to accomplish those things. Patents shouldn't cover things that are, at best, features!<p>You might respond by pointing to Windows Phone as an example of a mobile OS that's different and NOT getting litigated over, but that's because Apple and Microsoft have cross-licensing agreements that have been in place since the last time Apple tried to pull this look-and-feel bullshit and lost.<p>Since you insist on using loaded language like ""Android ripped off ... Apple"", what evidence do you have to back that up? Also, what makes you say that the ""anti-patent movement started with [Google]""? You're aware that people have had concerns about software patents long before this, right? Take Amazon's one-click patent as an example of something that stirred up a similar amount of nerd rage. It's not propaganda, just other people arriving at a pretty reasonable conclusion and stating it.",1346127383

Its a kind of a dish which will taste horrible if don't get the ingredients right to the very pinch.<p>For stack ranking to work you will need awesome leaders at the top rung in the company. You will need to fight out politics, processes and eliminate bureaucracy. You will also need a fair measuring of performance. Without all of this you see managers awarding their yes-men(their pets and bootlickers basically) top ranks and the good guys will leaving the organization. Unfortunately its very easy to get into this mode, especially if you are a large company will several layers of management- this kind of things can run for years until irreversible damage is caused. The net result after years will be false or irrelevant numbers floating in the company, while the best talent has already left.<p>Even Jack Welch, mentions that stack ranking works best if everybody in the organization is stack ranked all the way up to the CEO. So that if some one cheats in the middle he will get ranked low under his manager and so on an so forth. This is very different to what happens in most big corporates. Managers are generally left immune to this process. The net result is they begin to form gangs of yes-men around them. Whoever refuses to be a part of it, slips out of favor of the manager and gets a bad ranking. Net result in mass is a disaster. Which is not apparent until very late.<p>So if you are company with a culture of politics, processes, nepotism, bureaucracy and biases. Stack ranking will not help, but rather destroy you.<p>I saw all this at a Mega Corp here in India.

Jeff Han's demo is a perfect example of it. For years, many people have been doing demos like this, but they've been doing it on big bulky setups like projected-desks, or in Han's example, using total internal reflection.<p>Apple just made a different implementation, using the same interaction gestures, on a capacitive screen. From a software point of view, the implementations are rather trivial and don't differ much except via how you obtain the input (e.g. capacitive, FTIR, cameras, etc) The main difference is shrinking down the whole thing so it fits on a phone.<p>The reason why this was possible in 2007 had nothing to do with Apple's software and everything to do with the ability to manufacture a capacitive screen that has the right sensitivity, accuracy, cost, weight, and power to fit into a phone.<p>Apple deserves engineering props for this. But they do not get credit for inventing pinch-to-zoom nor the capacitive screen. Both of these inventions came prior.<p>If Apple invents an entirely new kind of touch screen and an entirely new way of manufacturing it, you could argue they deserve a patent.<p>But taking what existed before, pinch-to-zoom on projection displays, and implementing it on a different screen does not deserve patent protection, anymore than taking an existing business method (e.g. 'selling flower bouquets by phone', adding the text 'via web site' or 'via mobile app') and slightly tweaking the medium in which the business is done to obtain another monopoly.<p>Should 'internet shopping cart' be allowed a patent when real world shopping carts already existed? It's crazy absurd.<p>If Apple's patent had even been more specific like ""pinch to zoom, but on this particular kind of screen"" I'd even have more sympathy for the argument, because at least other people could do the same thing Apple did: <i>copy</i> an existing idea and apply it to a new circumstance. Samsung and others could innovate by creating new types of displays, maybe using microscopic cameras to track your hands like minority report or something.<p>But granting a patent to Apple for pinch to zoom on any kind of screen?

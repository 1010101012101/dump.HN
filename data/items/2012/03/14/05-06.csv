I realize there have been elements of this even from the beginning of Y Combinator, but just because a change is gradual doesn't mean it's not important.<p>That's not to say it's a bad move. Education is one big, slow target screaming ""make money off me!"" There's also a really big chance to help people at the same time, which is of course a nice overlap. But some of the dangers that make elementary schools suck, and high schools suck, and both American and foreign colleges suck will be waiting for you as well.

If you can still read your book from 1640 that's really great but realistically how common is that? There are a lot of environmental factors that affect paper duration and in many areas of the world, a decade is already very long for paper (have worked with an NGO based in Thailand that has 15 years of archives; the first 5 years are hardly readable)<p>As I said, digital data has the <i>potential</i> to exist forever. Digital data is independent from the media. A media is mostly cheap and disposable.<p>> Now, if you think that every book with stereotypes should be discarded, that's sad.<p>I certainly didn't mean that (cf. ""gold mine"").<p>> We have the responsibility to preserve history, and the moral duty to challenge what we consider wrong with our reason.<p>My point exactly. Which is why my comment invited the op to get a data dump and archive it properly. We all know that paper is sensible and would be careful for storage. We need to build and apply a similar set of precautions to store our digital data.<p>> To wipe it off, that's censorship and a recurrent disease of totalitarian mindsets.<p>Definitely OT.",1331704620

What Russ Cox is missing is that, absent some way to write generic code, programmers will end up paying the exact same taxes via their handwritten non-generic code.<p>Consider, for example, a binary search tree that can be instantiated with keys of int type or keys of string type. There are two ways to implement this in Go: (a) use an interface and dispatch calls through a vtable; or (b) implement the tree twice, once for ints and once for strings. But note: these two implementation strategies carry the exact same costs as the corresponding implementation strategies for generics! In the case of (a), the programmer is performing boxing via interface types, while in the case of (b), the programmer is performing code duplication. So not having generics doesn't relieve Go programs of compile-time or runtime overhead in any way; it simply increases the burden on the programmer.",1331704049

Dropping 2.3 and then 2.4 were major logistical hurdles; they were incredibly widely deployed, and were the stock Python for many platforms with long-term support. So it was going to take a while, no matter what, for us to sensibly deprecate those Python versions without just throwing a bunch of our users under a bus. And, of course, deprecating everything older than 2.6 is a prerequisite for starting to actually adopt 3.x.<p>Meanwhile, the first few releases in the Python 3 series weren't really meant for widespread adoption, <i>ever</i>. They were there so people could start getting a taste of Python 3 and working out a migration process while shaking out remaining issues for Python itself.<p>We are now at a confluence of two very happy things:<p>1. We've dropped our support for the older Python 2.x releases, without just screwing over a bunch of people, and by year's end we'll be a minimum-2.6 project, and<p>2. Python 3.2 (the current 3.x) is really quite a nice release, and Python 3.3 (later this year) looks like it'll really put the spit and polish on the Python 3.x series, meaning it's a very attractive time to be targeting Python 3.<p>This is the first time we've realistically been in a position to actually make the jump, and we're taking that opportunity.",1331703562

I like writing Go programs quickly, but not at the expense of compilation speed or execution speed. The point of Go is to be fast. If I valued programming speed for a particular program, then I would use the right tool for the job and choose a language other than Go.<p> Though considering the speed of Plan 9-style compilers, I can't imagine at what scale this would begin to be a problem.",1331703095

3701952,comment,3701597,3701918,9,0,ootachi,,,"From an implementation perspective, generics aren't that bad. For an ahead-of-time-compiled language, you either need a uniform value representation (like ML/Java) or a monomorphization pass (like C++). The former corresponds to what Go has today if you simulate generics with interfaces. The latter corresponds to what Go has today if you simulate generics by duplicating your code (for example, if you wrote an IntTree to operate on ints, a StringTree to operate on strings, and so on).<p>They do complicate the typechecker a little bit, largely due to the interaction with subtyping (which Go has via interfaces, I believe). You probably want definition-site variance, not use-site variance like Java, to keep things simple. Also remember that parameterized types must be invariant, not covariant, in the presence of mutability. (Additionally, if you have subtyping for function types, remember that the arguments are contravariant -- Go probably doesn't care about this, though.)<p>None of this stuff is that complicated, though -- it's all pretty straightforward at this point. There's no reason to fear generics.<p>Moreover, as noted above, all of the workarounds end up duplicating effort that the compiler could have done for you. If you use interfaces, you pay the tax of boxing. If you use code duplication, you pay the cost of increased compile times and increased binary size. Nothing is gained from not having generics, except maybe a simpler type system.",1331703054

Every single program on your machine has a uniform UI.  Sure, there might be tweaks here and there and differences in icons, but the UI is consistent.  You get on any Mac and things look and work the same way.  You get on any PC (save Windows 8!) and everything looks and works the same way.<p>Has anyone ever said:  I am not going to use <insert very useful software tool here> because the UI looks exactly the same as the UI on <insert another common software tool here>?  Probably not.<p>Well, why is it that every site on the 'net has to look and work differently?  If form follows function then most sites don't really need to reinvent the wheel.  Yes, they need to deal with app-specific paradigms, but that's no different than the difference between, say, Excel, Word, Photoshop, iTunes and Dreamweaver.<p>Somehow on the desktop we have come to understand that a stable, uniform and well-understood UI is actually useful. While I am not sure that this translates directly into the web, I don't really agree with the idea that lots of sites using Bootstrap is equivalent to the end of the universe as we know it.<p>Considering how many downright awful sites there are this is probably an absolute gift from the Flying Spaghetti Monster (who's name shall never be uttered in vane).",1331701504

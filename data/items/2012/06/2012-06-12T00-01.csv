EBS removes a lot of Sysadmin & DBA headaches, but when you suddenly get mysterious DB stalls, good luck trying to figure out what's wrong.<p>I've worked with some systems that used a software RAID10 array of EBS volumes, and when a single EBS volume started to flake out, they'd just kick it out of the array, and performance would improve.  They'd then rebuild the failed replica during off hours.  If you're going to rely on EBS for DB storage for anything in production, this seems like this is the way to go.",1339462331

You can't maintain that and open up the hardware ecosystem; it's an either/or choice.  So far, their choice has worked out really, really well for them, so why should they mess with that?<p>I'm sure you're aware of Apple's fairly disastrous entry into the world of Mac clones back in the day.  What you're arguing now is essentially the same theory back then:  clones would benefit them by increasing the marketshare for their OS.  Instead, clones just cannibalized Apple's own sales and diluted their brand with a bunch of crappy knock-offs.  I'm not sure why anyone would expect it to play out differently now.<p>Sure, it might be in your interest as a consumer to have choice in hardware, but I don't see how it's in Apple's interest to do so.

4098031,comment,4094671,4096810,4,0,einhverfr,,,"I go back and forth on how helpful RMS is.  On one hand, where would we be without the GCC?  This is something he helped get going.<p>On the other, I see him as someone who misinterprets a bunch of things because it is convenient for him politically to do so.  The two examples are what happens when you dynamically link GPL software to proprietary software (static linking is arguably a bigger deal with the GPL v3 than the GPL v2), and taking extreme positions as to what the GPL versions require of developers bridging proprietary and GPL software.<p>The second is his view of what the BSD license allows and he makes false claims here he bases his view that the BSD and GPL v3 licenses are compatible on.  The BSD license probably does not allow sublicensing in the opinion of <i>most</i> lawyers I have talked to (Eben Moglen being the sole exception!) and so if relicensing/sublicensing is a requirement for compatibility with the GPL v3, the BSD license is incompatible but the MIT license is compatible.  Last I discussed this with Moglen he seemed to think it was safe just because the BSD author would lack standing or on other technical grounds.  Every other lawyer I have talked to says ""don't assume it's safe to take BSD code and add license restrictions without first making significant changes"" (this is also the Software Freedom Law Center's official recommendation also) something the GPL v3 explicitly requires.  (The counter-argument is that everyone involved in drafting the GPL v3 believed it to be compatible with the BSD license and this was a goal so BSD compatibility should be read into the license.  This was what Richard Fontana argued when I brought this up on the OSI email lists).<p>I actually still use the GPL v2 and BSD licenses almost exclusively, and RMS is a big part of the reason I won't consider upgrading to the GPL v3.",1339462067

4098002,comment,4097331,4097331,10,0,geuis,,,"Gonna play devil's advocate for a moment. Disclaimer: I don't work for Apple. I love their products (4 iPhones, 1 iPad, more 3 laptops in the last year, 1 Hackintosh that was an old gaming tower I built 3 years ago and never used till I put OS X on it, which I purchased).<p>Apple's core revenue sources have changed significantly over the years. Used to be towers were a primary source of revenue. That's most likely no longer true, and hasn't been for a while.<p>Take into account how much money Apple has to spend on R&D internally for their products. That's not only hardware, its also software support. One thing I've learned in the Hackintosh community is that while there's a lot of hardware that works really well, its a subset of all the hardware out there (chips, mobos, graphics cards, etc). You have to pay special attention to your hardware or getting OS X running is a huge pain in the ass, if impossible. It costs a lot of money to have good programmers to support hardware.<p>I have to choose to believe that the people at Apple know what they're doing for the benefit of their company. If the internal folks responsible for weighing the scales have found that the amount of revenue earned for cost of development and all for Mac Pros is too narrow, or even negative, then its entirely responsible for them to be phasing out the availability of this product line.<p>Yeah, <i>lots</i> of people want Mac Pro towers. That includes me. I'd still love to switch out my Hackintosh for a Mac Pro if just for the freedom to freely do software updates without worry. I develop about 50/50 between it and my laptop.<p>But for Apple, who have proven over and over again that they know where their markets are going, they may be finding little to no value in continuing the Mac Pro line.<p>A lot of people will counter with the argument that since Apple has so many billions of dollars, its just a drop in the bucket for them to continue Mac Pros. That may be true, but Apple isn't a company like Microsoft. They don't tend to waste billions of dollars on products that go nowhere or have little chance of success. Its true that Apple has had failures (Ping anyone?), but they are very small in comparison to their successes.<p>Many people reading this may be too young to remember Apple from the late 80's and 90's. They were lost and wandering in the woods. They almost died a few times. I remember going with my mom to get our first Mac in the early 90's and having to pick between 3-4 different models of the same Performa series. They had multiple types of desktops available, including the Performa, Quadra, and others. Their product skews were all over the place.<p>It wasn't until Jobs came back and brought a laser focus to their product lines that they turned around. He spent the last decade imprinting that way of thought on the entire company. Its vital to their future success, and our enjoyment and the productivity that comes from their products, that it continues. I would like to hope that there is an endemic fear in the company of losing that focus and going back to the Apple of old.<p>So if Apple has found that the Mac Pro line is no longer worth it, its entirely reasonable that they begin phasing it out. I'm choosing to look forward and see what they're doing next, and how I can use what they're building to make cool, amazing new stuff. Not looking back and complaining that old things I thought were valuable are being taken away.",1339461701

4097984,comment,4092986,4095343,1,0,einhverfr,,,"My view is just that increases in equity of firms held overseas, where the US firm holds a controlling share (i.e. greater than 50% of voting shares) should be subject to taxes as corporate income taxes.  It also neatly avoids the problem of double taxation on the basis of dividend payments.    Dividend payments would be deducted for overseas holdings before taxes, meaning that the dividend payment gets taxed as income but so does the post-dividend retained earnings.  For overseas holdings of less than a controlling share it seems to me that whatever rules exist for capital gains would apply.  If that's not enough offer a tax credit equal to foreign taxes paid.<p>I also think our approach to capital gains needs to be rethought.  I understand why taxing capital gains as straight income is undesirable especially where the middle class is involved and where gains off home sales may be a factor.  However, I wonder if a better option would be to allow capital gains to be folded into income going forward, amortized for the period of time the asset was held.  So if you live in your home for 10 years and sell it at a capital gain of $500000, then you would add $50k to your reported income for the next 10 years following the sale.  This would also privilege retirement accounts because at some point the amortization period would exceed life expectancy.<p>This would neatly address the issue of the super-wealthy paying a lower tax rate than the middle class, while continuing to favor retirement-oriented and long-held assets.",1339461395

For example, if I'm shopping for something, rather than opening a whole bunch of tabs, I'll just bounce back and forth using forward and back. I think I do this especially when I'm farther away from what I want, and as I start to zero in more, I start opening more tabs at once so I can compare.<p>Also, from some usability studies we've done at my job, it seems that most people are almost completely unable to deal with window management. We rolled out functionality for a while that broke the back button (poorly-implemented infinite scroll) and found that our pages performed very poorly, because people would lose their place and just leave. We kind of had assumed that most people would use tabs, but that turned out not to be the case at all.<p>Anecdotally, watching my mom use the computer recently was enlightening. She's been using computers longer than I have, and is very savvy with certain things (e.g., she still knows how to use Excel to solve problems better than I do, and I know Excel pretty damn well.) She seems to use browser tabs sort of like ""processes"", rather than ""threads"". For example, she'll have her ""hotel search"" tab, her ""rental car"" tab, and her ""flight search"" tab, and within those tabs, she'll stick to that topic, using the back buttons to look at different pages. When I switched spots with her, and started spawning a whole bunch of tabs from each tab, she started to lose track of things.<p>* Edit: actually, I almost never use the buttons themselves, but I use the functionality as I described.

If Gumroad has 10% of the customers that Amazon has and you get 2x the revenue per book sold, you will only see an increase proportional to 10% of the sales at Amazon. As a worked example<p>219 Amazon customers $5.10 per book -> $1117 in revenue
22 Gumroad customers $9.25 per book -> $209 in revenue<p>It's the area under the curve that is important. In a traditional publishing arrangement you would give a bigger 'discount' to a big seller (say Barnes and Noble) vs a boutique seller like 'World Books'. One has 10,000 stores, the other 4 stores. Because while you get less per book, you sell more books and make more overall (price * volume, not just price).<p>So I seriously doubt you would even have matched the Amazon revenue, if you had gone through Gumroad and precluded Amazon.<p>So when you look at it you need to sum all of the sales, and all of the margins, and you will get your 'average selling price' or ASP. This will help you understand how much you can profitably 'invest' in putting together a book. As your reputation grows, if you garner an audience, then you can 'count' on more total revenue per book and take some of the guesswork out of the planning.<p>The other part of the equation is time, since it takes a while for people to get the book and recommend it, there can be several months of 'growth' before you really know what the market for your book is.<p>I totally understand that you were surprised had the additional charges that Amazon specified but didn't make clear (and that Apple does a better job of this I think is a good thing since they are the competition). Unfortunately PDF is a horrible book format as it pre-computes for a given render and that means that it looks like crap on readers that don't fit the mold. Epub is much better, as is mobi. For what its worth the last time I was looking through the Writers Guide (one of my daughters is looking to creative writing as a career) selling 1500 travel books if you weren't Michelen or Fodor's was a 'big' title, so selling 300 pretty much right off the bat is <i>huge</i>.

4097910,comment,4094671,4095242,3,0,einhverfr,,,"Well, here's the approach my business is taking:<p>1)  You can bill up-front for major features development.  If someone wants a major feature they can may for it.  This reduces the risk of software development because much more of the development is being paid for up front.  However the revenue doesn't scale and it's subject to boom/bust problems.  This being said it's a great strategy to mitigate financial risk in product development.<p>2)  You can find areas where #1 doesn't work and come up with some sort of customer agreement that does scale.  The nice thing is that if that area really doesn't work (updates to payroll for example) for reasons inherent here, then you won't have someone else release something like it fully on an open source model and have to compete with free.<p>So the way I look at it is that I get some things for free (financing for development), my customers get some things for free(software, upgrades on main packages), and this then creates a market for services I can charge more for because the overall package is less expensive.<p>ERP is huge business but the thing about it is that going with an open source approach brings benefits to smaller businesses that are currently reserved for huge businesses.  A multi-pronged approach to revenue here (consulting, subscriptions, support contracts), allows you to take advantage of network effects between these things, cut risk, and still maintain general scalability of revenues.<p>If others want to do this with LedgerSMB I would generally advise against competing with core, long-term members of the community.  You are more likely to succeed if you carve out a niche for yourself in an area that's not being done or is underdeveloped (MRP would be a good example with LedgerSMB).",1339460368

He directed all of his marketing efforts to the book on amazon.com; presumably he could have captured a good number of those purchases elsewhere.<p>I think the real issue is less about costs and more about how Amazon hides big revenues behind ""delivery fees."" Most platforms (Apple, Google, PayPal, even Amazon in the AWS world) that take a percentage cut + special fees separate the special fees to mirror actual costs (e.g. credit card processing). In this case Amazon just used it as another place to add significant markup, presumably in a way that was not expected.<p>Should he have read the contract more closely? Yeah, no question. But it still strikes me as sleazy on Amazon's part, even though I agree with you that a lot of what he did was only possible because of what Amazon's done.",1339459489
4097832,comment,4097585,4097751,2,0,bartonfink,,,"So, a standard functionality for web applications is commonly referred to as CRUD. Many applications exist solely to let users Create records, Retrieve and Update existing records or Delete records. It's a very common pattern that, while it isn't very interesting in and of itself, will give you exposure to all the parts of a web application without bogging you down in questions of functionality (what does it mean for all the associated foo's if a bar record has its created date deleted?).<p>To do this, you'll need some mechanism to store records (usually a database of some sort, but flat files can work), some sort of server process to handle user requests (this is where a framework like Rails and possibly a server to contain this process come into the picture) and a web interface where users can actually input data into your system. If you hear the term ""full stack"" before, it roughly means this picture (and note that this doesn't really correspond to MVC if you've heard of that).<p>The canonical example in academia is to do a course scheduling app: students enroll in college and register for classes. Other typical options are the aforementioned to-do application or inventory for a store. Really, this is just window-dressing though - if I were you, I'd think it's a fine goal to have a good understanding of everything that happens from the moment a user first sees the interface to your app until the moment the database is done storing their changes.<p>And, if you really want a language recommendation, I'd go with either Ruby using Rails or Java using Play.",1339459466

Trying to run through a big multi-track synth setup would probably bring a MBP to it's knees.<p>With audio, it is seriously child's play. Compression is about as CPU intensive as you can get with audio outside of voice recognition, and it just isn't there.<p>Video is mostly offloaded on to GPU's these days. The MBP GPU is definitely a big step down from what you can get on a desktop, but you can always get a dedicated bit of hardware that you attach to your MBP to get that job done. The real killer on video has traditionally been I/O. With SSD's and Thunderbolt, you have some alternatives.<p>> I still do not think that Intel can cram in the same level of performance into a 35W chip that use to go into a 90W platform just 2-3 years ago.<p>You might want to check out Moore's Law.",1339459338

Even groundbreaking, ""hard"" ideas (e.g. Calculus) can occur in several places at once. Certainly, a flash game widget is not a new idea and is being implemented by dozens of start-ups at this point in time. The fact that two of them were connected with YCombinator is neither surprising nor inappropriate.<p>This is a good example of why VCs never sign NDAs, basically. The chances of this stuff happening by chance (rather than malice) is way too high.<p>It sounds trite, perhaps, but it's worth repeating that ideas are just one ingredient in a successful start-up.

Right now there's a large amount of work going into js frameworks that means that we'll see these techniques become standardized over time.<p>3. If you look at desktop clients there's actually a lot of innovation in terms of small UI components (see most things that Apple is doing) and so desktop clients are by no means static.<p>4.

467602,comment,467427,467427,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Some really great points. Couple very quick thoughts, and then ideas about your points. First, you only need to average 3.5 to be oranage if that's a concern, meaning posts around 2 or 3 don't set you back much, and just a few +10 or +20 comments here and there means you can comment totally freely and stay orange.<p>2. Don’t post on a front page post that already has more than a full page of text.... You’re just yelling into the void. --> I actually think this is GREAT. People won't post into an already largely full thread unless they have real insight that's bursting to get out, instead of rehashing some obvious observation.<p>3. When possible, reply to a highly rated comment that doesn’t already have replies. Particularly focus on getting your comment to appear ""above the fold"" when it is posted. This will ensure that your comment is read and enjoyed. --> If it gets abused for gamesmanship, that's ugly. However, an insightful follow-on or dissent from the top comment IS more read, and thus does create more value, and thus, more karma. But we should be vigilant as a community to these karma-jackers.<p>4. Don't post against the prevailing mood of a post. If the mood of that article is pro-libertarian, beware critiquing that philosophy! On the other hand, when the population is more balanced in that individual thread, feel free. In general someone who agrees is more likely to upvote than someone who disagrees, so you should get be ahead on balance. --> At first, this really upset me. I've seen a lot of warm'n'happy comments get upvoted more than an insightful point I made that I assume took heat from people with a different opinion based on the voting patterns around it. Then I realized - if you're on something controversial, it's got to either be balanced, or really good to get community respect. If people reflect for a minute before spouting talking points, that could be a good thing.<p>5. As soon as you make a comment, upvote the article and all of the parents to your comment. This will put your article closer to the public eye. If you want to truly join the dark side, vote down the other comments on the thread or other replies. I’ve never done this, but it’s an option. --> Yeah, could be a big problem - will be interesting to see how it plays out.<p>6. Say something interesting. Without this, you’ve got nothing! --> This is awesome.<p>7. If you’re trying to be funny or sarcastic, make it incredibly obvious. If it’s not incredibly obvious what you’re trying to say, don’t bother posting. --> I'm not everyone, but I HATE online sarcasm. It's cheap and easy to get that ANYWHERE. The internet is overflowing with sarcasm. I like that Hacker News is really an intelligent discussion place, and humor is used less frequently and more judiciously than elsewhere.<p>8. Don't get involved in a long discussion! This will only end with a bunch of 1 point posts that drag your average down. --> Finally, I just realized something. I try to check my comments later and see if anyone replied to me. I'm going to make more of an effort to upvote 1-karma posts that were late to the party if they offer even a bit of insight, as a way of saying thanks for keeping the discussion going.<p>Cheers Gavin!",1233833585

467567,comment,467546,467546,0,0,robg,,,"I worry about this division between users but kudos to pg for trying an worthwhile test. It's an example where I wish there was some content analysis with karma to illustrate spheres of influence. But I just don't think we can ever get there with such small samples of text, as is typical of the vast majority of comments.<p>If you don't like the current ""division"" between users, then please offer some alternatives. I'm stumped. I recognize the need but I'm not sure it fits. Rather than be outed as an Orange, I might prefer some increased weight on comment upvotes but behind the scenes. At least then there could still be some behavior modification, but it would be mostly without division between the haves and have-nots.<p>EDIT: Maybe it's just my latent fear of getting beat up as soon as we walk out of the room?",1233832124
467566,comment,467363,467363,0,0,lallysingh,,,"I've tried a lot of systems (omni* and a few others), but here are what stick with me:<p>Emacs Org-Mode for the day-to-day stuff that I want to keep in front of me when I'm writing code.  It's essentially perfect for it.  Using the tables with pasted-in code is utterly fantastic (hint: replace-regex '^' with '|> ' and it'll keep your indentation before you hit tab and tablify the code).<p>Org mode does tables, outlines, todo lists, agendas, mostly everything a programmer's going to want day to day.<p>For higher-level planning, I leave the workstation.  Get a cup of coffee/soda/juice/who-are-we-kidding-its-coffee and a table away from computers.  A moleskine (the squared one, with the grid layout) and a good pen (I like these $4 pilot extra-fine vballs) is what I use.  Relaxing music in noise-canceling headphones FTW.<p>Do yourself a favor and begin with the habit of writing the date on a page when you start writing on it.  It's useful for you to see your progress over time, and it can be helpful later in patent disputes.<p>As for the thinking process itself, here's my heuristic:<p>- Small apps are mostly driven by a framework you just use (probably some MFC/DI garbage).  Keep your code clean & organized, and work a little to keep the expected chaos from working with always-mysterious frameworks contained.  E.g. don't ever trust the framework to handle your model code for you.  Use proxy classes, multiple inheritance, whatever to firewall yourself from that chaos.<p>- Medium apps have enough internal structure to get past the cognitive mass of the framework.  There, you end up with a top-level abstraction that structures the app.  Be it a pipeline, a set of command objects, or a data structure you maintain, there's one big one and the app is structured by it.<p>- Large apps have a few of these.  They're independent subsystems and you firewall their interactions the best you can.  Unless you've got the time/labor for large-scale refactoring, you generally just try to keep the abstractional dams from breaking.  In those cases, I usually try to get some middleware in there, so I can easily handle stubs, testing, and interactive use with each.  If you've got a REPL, you can avoid it, but in C++/Java, it can really help.",1233832095

After careful consideration, we made the decision that we needed to exercise our rights now so we could be in a position to sell our interest when the timing made sense for us.”<p>The language twists that publicly traded companies go through in order to express themselves are really tiring.<p>The plain text translation of that to me reads: ""We don't want to kill you outright in public but we're tired of you and because the market is contracting we'd like to get out while the getting out is good. Also we'd like you very much to not switch to a competitor once we've ditched you.""",1233832058

On the other hand (using the pumping lemma[1]) you can prove that that set is not regular, hence not detectable by a standard regex.<p>[1] <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=MDQ_K7-z2AMC&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=finite+automaton+prime&source=bl&ots=0wWTv5AeBd&sig=6sOwOf6PNdQmcvI6QhWVMKLvKKA&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=MDQ_K7-z2AMC&pg=PA47&#3...</a>",1233831922

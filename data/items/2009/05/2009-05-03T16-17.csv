591001,comment,590922,590922,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I’d do it if I were you.<p>I won’t lie.  In my opinion the chances of success are slim to none.  But this is the best time of your life to take a chance.  The more adult you get the less able you are to take huge chances.  So as long as you hang on to enough money to get yourself home should things go bad I don’t see a down side (where as if you don't you could end up regretting it for the rest of your life)<p>That said, two pieces of advice....<p>First, get this book: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Ask-Moon-Get-Percy-Ross/dp/0722529465/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1241369356&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Ask-Moon-Get-Percy-Ross/dp/0722529465/...</a><p>Percy Ross went from nothing to being a millionare and he attributes most of that to getting help from the right people.  In that book he gives his 10 rules on how to ask for people's  help and get it.  The most important thing to remember if you do this is that 90% of the people in the bay area tech scene have been where you are (aka chasing a dream).  If you need help and you ask right I suspect most will do what they can to help you succeed.<p>Second, look into hostels: <a href=""http://www.hostels.com/us.ca.sf.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hostels.com/us.ca.sf.html</a><p>Hostels are basically cheap dorms for anyone to stay in.  They’re not very popular in the U.S. but in Europe there are tons of them and they serve young people with little money very well.  The bay area has more than just about any U.S. city so you should be able to find a cheap place to sleep (and most have free wifi)<p>Anyway, hope it helps.",1241369948
590999,comment,590922,590922,0,0,gojomo,,,"I live in SF, it's a great city, and if ""living in SF/bay-area"" is your dream, go for it.<p>But that's not quite the same dream as ""reach ramen profitability on my web project"". In fact, the two dreams may conflict. Moving to and learning a new area takes a bunch of time and money, and the bay area (especially SF proper) is expensive -- compared to Seattle or living with family.<p>For a young techie, the biggest benefit I could imagine being in the bay area versus Seattle is a larger job market and scene of potential collaborators.  But are those what you need to make your project ramen-profitable -- or do those opportunities represent other paths entirely?",1241369936

590995,comment,590922,590922,0,0,cog,,,"(Background: I came from grad school in Seattle to SF for my job.)<p>(a) Freelance work is heavily dependent on contacts.  If you don't have contacts then it's a crapshoot.  Maybe you'll luck into something, maybe you won't.<p>(b) For housing, scan <a href=""http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/sub/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/sub/</a> ; $700 is not impossible, but you'll be living in a spare room of someone's house, and even then that's the low end & you should expect compromises.  SF housing is <i>much</i> more expensive than Seattle, as in 2x the cost for equivalent space.  I don't know where you got the idea that the costs are comparable (are you mistakenly including East Bay or South Bay prices instead of SF city prices only?).  $100 for food is doable if you know how to buy cheap food in bulk and cook it yourself.  As for ""everything else"", heat/electric/broadband can easily consume close to $200 if you're living alone.  In a share it should be less, but you should ask about utility costs in your housing situation.  On that budget, you should not count on spending any money on entertainment.  There's some free entertainment to be had if you're scrappy, but expect to get most of your entertainment from walking around the city or riding your bike through the parks.<p>(c) Summer SF weather is <i>colder</i> than summer Seattle weather.  Bring sweaters.<p>(d) [you skipped (d)]<p>(e) SF is an expensive place to live.  If this is your 2.5 months of adventure before college, then you just have to weigh whether you're willing to pay $3k for that experience.  (Not a bad way to spend it actually.)  If you're really trying to bootstrap into a sustainable living situation, SF isn't the best place to go with as little savings as you have; there's too much danger of burning through your seed capital before you get revenue-positive ;).  I get the sense that for you it's more the former than the latter --- that is, there's not much downside if you fail --- so what the hell, go for it.",1241369628

I was born in Chicago, but moved to Puerto Rico when I was a kid and lived there for 20 years. Puerto Rico is much, much cheaper than anywhere in the United States (My rent for the two-bedroom apartment I was living in was $250 per month). But after being stuck in a meaningless PHP gig (where I was more of the company sysadmin than a developer) and having a difficult time getting a programming job, I started looking to the U.S. for a better opportunity.<p>I landed a job in New York City, where I'm currently living at. The city is awesome and my job is fun. But in reality, the Bay Area was my first choice, and it's still dream of mine to be able to land a job over there. I'm in the process of getting more information to further my skills so I can begin actively searching for work over there.<p>I was doing well in Puerto Rico (earning more money than most people I knew, living close to beach with constantly great weather, all my friends and family living there, etc.) and I'm certainly doing well in New York City. But if I had the chance to move to San Francisco, I wouldn't think twice about it. Maybe I'm wrong, but the Bay Area is kind of like the Mecca for developers and aspiring entrepreneurs like myself.<p>Like I said, I certainly can't speak for mannicken. I'm sure he has his own reasons, perhaps even similar to my own reasons. But if he's really willing to do it, that should be reason enough, regardless of where he is now.",1241369607

I see no plan here and really no reason for you to take such a leap, so why bother wasting your money just to move locations for the summer.  Anything you would be doing there could be done from where you are.  Save your $3000, continue working on what you have, and if it seems to be a good idea, invest it into that product.  You gain nothing by moving there (unless you find actual work).  I really don't understand why everyone here is telling you to do it.  I know at 18 it can seem glamorous to do something so crazy but if you sit back and think about it for a second, its pretty stupid.  If you have a finished product and have something to gain by moving there (like finding people to work with or for you on it) then I could see it.

Quite impressive for such an old browser.",1241366766

Not yet, anyway.<p>Take games, for example. The Tower Defense game is nice enough, but no where near the quality of the Flash based versions. And this is a very, very simple game compared to, say, Fancy Pants Adventures or  the like. Can processing.js. I mean, the missiles don't even point at their target, for crying out loud.<p>This is on the level of C64/PET character based graphics, more or less.<p>Again, I know nothing about processing.js at this point, so, perhaps it's possible to do much more.<p>Two other questions come to mind, though:<p>1. Flash already has its issues vis a vie cross-browser and cross-platform performance. It's not at all bad, and, because of the developer base, pretty well defined, but certainly not perfect. How does this technology compare, especially given the widely disparate support for native canvas and decent JavaScript engines?<p>2. What about packaging and distribution? .swfs can be self contained, making distribution to, say, portals nice and easy. A whole infrastructure for add supported apps has grown up in the Flash world, as well.",1241366611

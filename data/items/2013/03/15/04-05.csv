5379286,comment,5374881,5377149,1,0,burntsushi,,,"> Production systems normally only replace shared libraries to fix vulnerabilities. So, that's a non-argument.<p>Vulnerabilities are usually unforeseen. Which means that upgrading a shared library---for any reason whatsoever---could introduce a new vulnerability to all programs using that library.<p>> On non-production systems, it's far easier to replace one vulnerable library, than tens of vulnerable Go programs. That is, if you know which Go program was using what version of that package again.<p>It's easier, but it comes with aforementioned cost. Also, relative difficulty matters here. Maybe you haven't used Go before, but that all seems pretty simple. Particularly given the tools to analyze Go programs built right into the standard library.<p>Also, FYI, shared Go libraries are on the roadmap. That doesn't really help, but it's certainly better than ""we refuse to add it.""",1363323508

5379266,comment,5378641,5378641,6,0,nikcub,,,"There are two distinct points here that are being a bit muddled. The first is the 457 visa issue. For those that don't know, it is a skilled immigration visa, similar to the H1B in the United States. Australia is coming up to an election in September where the sitting center-left Prime Minister is very likely to lose her Prime Ministership to the center-right party.<p>To sure up her base on the left yesterday she came out and attacked the 457 visa and said that they needed to be more tightly regulated, since they are being exploited by some and are taking jobs away from Australians.<p>Prominent Australian entrepreneurs came out in support of the visa, and argued that you can't grow a new information economy without the importation of skilled labour to make up for the shortfall in local skills. This was the biggest national news item yesterday.<p>As an analogy, imagine if Obama came out in support of lowering H1B visa's or restricting their use, and the shit that would cause.<p>The <i>second</i> issue here, which Matt also takes on by attaching it to the first, is what a lot of people in the startup world feel is a disadvantage that the Australian startup ecosystem has over its US, Israeli etc. counterparts. This argument has been playing out for years now, to not a lot of effect.<p>I think there is a contradiction in this argument, when you combine the two together. On the one hand you are asking the government to leave you alone and let you import labour, but on the other hand you are asking them to do something about the lack of venture investment, the lack of skills, university places, etc.<p>I think the later argument of asking the government to do something to assist startups stems from a misunderstanding of how silicon valley works and why it became successful. This misidentification leads to a feeling that with one or two changes you could 'clone' what has made silicon valley a success, which is not true.<p>The attitude in Silicon Valley has always been to be left alone by the government. The tech industry in the USA is grossly underrepresented in Washington lobby groups (only recently have Google, Apple and Microsoft invested more in lobbying as their businesses broaden and intersect areas where government has more control, such as spectrum).<p>Further to that, Australia ranks well in most global indicies for business startup, running a business and open markets. We actually outrank the USA in ability to start a company, and we rank about even in other business friendliness metrics[0].<p>I think Australia's major problem is cultural. We have a fear of failure, a lack of entrepreneurial spirit, and a severe tall poppy syndrome (all of which I have experienced first hand - ironically from some of the very people who are most vocal about wanting to make Australia more like Silicon Valley).<p>These should be a clear indication that the ""problem"" with the Australian startup scene (if there is one, I don't think there is) is not the cause or fault of the government.<p>I think Matt would have been better served here to focus his argument on the 457 issue, using the same arguments he has (such as Australia won't always have things to dig out of the ground), but leaving the other issues alone for now.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.gfmag.com/tools/global-database/economic-data/11862-best-countries-for-doing-business.html#axzz2NZyqAC00"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gfmag.com/tools/global-database/economic-data/118...</a>",1363322659

It's a hopelessly imprecise statement that, if you're like me, primarily just engenders stress and shame.  Instead use active language re: precise tasks.  e.g. ""I'm going to fix my bike and go to the store this afternoon.""<p>Fiore does talk a lot about similar language issues in the Now Habit.  For example, he stresses the importance of saying things like ""I <i>choose</i> to work on this report now"" versus ""I have to work on this report now.""<p>His argument is that the latter promotes a victimhood mentality leading to resentment and then procrastination.<p>He also points out that it's simply untrue.

Why spend a bunch of time trying to convince Windows and OS X users to use something they don't want to. I really don't understand Linux users obsession with converting other people. I suppose it springs out of GNU and the RMS style wish to convert the world to FOSS. While I think it would be great if all software was Free, I don't think it's worth worrying over weather or not Linux is ""ready"" for the desktop.",1263081584

Apparently they were not interested :(<p>Probably you tried to pay 7.25$, per hour did not you?\nIf you'll pay me 25 dollars per hour for making shoes - you can hire me. \nAmerican deindustrialization caused by MOVING INDUSTRIES OUT OF USA, (Even food industry partially moved to China - apple juice consumed in USA for example 75% made in China). Enginnering has _nothing_ to do about deindustrilization, in fact you do not need more than couple of engineers to run a rather big plastics factory, Drop of demand (but there is still a lot of it) for engineering position in universities is just a reflection of current state of industry in USA. Combination of very bad labor protection in USA (no health protection, third world minimal salary, [do not tell me 7.25/h is a good compensation]) and ""free trade"" policies supported by government results in deindustrialization.\nLack of good jobs causes enormous inequality in USA, as bad as in African countries. USA Gini (inequality index) = 46, higher than Nigeria = 43 and eqaul to Rwanda's. Canadian for comparison GINI = 32.<p>Guys, whoever give negative score - I do not care to be honest - I know I step on ambitions/complexes that USA is the best country in the world (whuch is not true) - it is you country, and you are going to live there.

Unfortunately, Windows has become a lot safer and stabler in the mean time; and we have come to realize that the security of Linux is not just because of technical reasons -- for a large part it is because it is simple a less interesting target. Also, the price is not really that important.<p>So, no, Linux will not quickly beat Windows on the desktop. On the other hand, it might become easier to switch, also as more and more software becomes available on Linux, and this could make Linux's growth at least pretty stable for a couple of years to come.",1263080319

One solution I found was to learn Statistics from the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science perspective. Instead of weird abstractions, in EE and CS one thinks of more concrete things, like random signals, or data sets. The best way to learn Statistics is to apply it.<p>One problem, though, is that knowing only a little Statistics might be worse than knowing nothing.",1263078618

There were a few bumps getting it started, but all in all I'm starting to enjoy using it as much as my Mac laptop, maybe more.<p>It may have the best GUI shell available for a small screen. Stuff that used to be tricky, like mounting devices or connecting to networks, is now quite elegant. Workhorse open source apps like Firefox and Thunderbird are now very mature and usable. I can get (some) decent fonts and they look about as good as any other OS on-screen.<p>So I can customize it more, and I have the reliability of apt-get, a lot of very good apps, and for the most part it is slick, attractive, and Just Works. Perfect for a hacker who hates system administration.<p>That said, Linux probably won't conquer on the desktop, ever. They missed their chance, because the desktop is now obsolete. Network-oriented devices like phones and the forthcoming Chrome netbook are the future. Ironically they will run Linux, but only for the most basic OS functions; all this desktop stuff will wither away.",1263078178

For example, what Cosma Shalizi writes on Statistics is much deeper than what Zed did. Another example: Andrew Gelman has a great blog on Statistics, and he's a true expert.<p>For me an ""expert"" is someone who has at least 10 years of experience in one field. An expert on Statistics must have carried out extensive data-analysis work, or must have published original papers. Reading books gives one some understanding, but only when one must solve a problem, does one realize that one's knowledge is utterly superficial.<p>Zed is no superman. His area of expertise is not Statistics, it's something else. I am not saying he's stupid. All I am saying is that he has not invested the many years of effort into studying Statistics to earn the title of ""expert"". By calling him an expert, one insults all the true experts out there, the one who do not write blog posts using juvenile language because, you know, they have better things to do... like spending time with their friends and family...",1263078095

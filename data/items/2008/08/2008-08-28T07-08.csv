288954,comment,288901,288901,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"My co-founder is married with two kids.  We were in winter 2007.  Neither of us is young and fresh out of college (I was 32, he was 33, at the time).  When we were accepted, I had a house in Austin, a 350Z, a long-time girlfriend, and a dog.  The house was sold in record time (to the first person who looked at it, the day <i>before</i> the open house), the Z was sold, the girlfriend got a job at Google, and the dog rode right beside me in the moving truck.  My co-founder already lived in Santa Clara, so it wasn't quite as much of an upheaval for him.",1219909828

The restaurant suggester could be easily add supported and is probably a bit more tractable.",1219909804

I always assumed most readers would do conditional gets and most refined services (like blogger.com) would implement that too, since it is saving them bandwidth.<p>It is just implementing http properly and being a good netizen - like actually sending an identifiable user agent and following robots.txt.<p>BTW, feedity.com's homepage renders badly on my Firefox 3.0.1/WinXP",1219909579

I'd been wondering the same, Have there been any YC startup people with teenagers??!!!<p>I suppose having teenagers would be a great way to recruit your first coding employees!

288945,comment,288398,288846,0,0,demallien,,,"I totally agree. This stupid argument comes about for one reason, and one reason only:  the law has not yet caught up with technology.<p>No, it's not stealing.  Yes it is wrong - if you don't pay for creative content, content creators won't create, which is a bad outcome for society (and no, don't give me any crap about people creating for free - sure, some might, but I certainly wouldn't be spending my weekends and nights writing an application if I didn't think I'd get some money for it, and I doubt that I'm rare!).<p>This is where governments are supposed to do their jobs - create laws to encourage desirable behaviour.  For example, they could start passing laws to make it illegal to publicly share copyright-protected works.  They could also make it illegal to facilitate the sharing of copyright-protected works, putting operations such as TPB under pressure.<p>Better than just making it a law, make it one of the conditions of membership in the WTO - it's a logical activity for the WTO anyhow, seeing as an increasing percentage of world trade is IP.  That way, there is a powerful tool available to force compliance at an international level.",1219908258

288941,comment,286046,288904,0,0,qwph,,,"Yeah, I actually think I really like Smalltalk-the-Language - it's a really tight set of primitives which interact in a powerful way - it reminds me of Scheme or Forth.<p>But being born and raised on the commandline, it's Smalltalk-the-Environment which causes me trouble. I often find myself wishing that I could just play with it like you would with, say, Ruby's irb. I find the conventions (having to highlight code and hit Ctrl-I to get it to run, and so on) quite off-putting. If I can get over that, I'm sure it'll be worth it, but it's a bit of a struggle.",1219907820

I must say, an entire summer seems like it might put a bit of stress on your relationship.<p>Let me be very clear! You can definitely do a startup if you have a family. YCombinator and startups are a great opportunity for anyone, regardless of age or family situation.<p>With that being said, a YC summer can be very intensive. Three full months apart and under stress might be more than you were bargaining for in terms of your relationship with your spouses and family. It seems like if all three of you are in this situation the odds are good that at least one of you will run into a problem.<p>There were a lot of guys in our class who had serious girlfriends and they all seemed to come out fine. My co-founder is married and our startup is doing just fine. Just think about what could happen, I would hate for that to be a big distraction for you guys.",1219907801

In Spain it's not illegal to make private copies of music and movies, and share it with friends. P2P is slightly different, and a legal void here because, although maybe not completely legal, its prohibition would be unenforceable due to privacy laws.<p>In fact, the right to make these copies justifies the ""canon"", a compensation that goes to ""spanish RIAA"" charging recording media, formerly CD/DVD and recently expanded to hard disks, memory sticks and even phones.<p>>- Morally, it's hard to argue that it's right<p>Not so hard, I've seen very convincent reasons. Excuse me if I don't share them, but, as you say, this is often an endless and unproductive argument.",1219907509

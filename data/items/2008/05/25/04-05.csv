199342,comment,199279,199326,0,0,sant0sk1,,,">""Even the truth as one ""believes"" it comes with bias, which one might consider a lie.""<p>When it comes to lying vs. ""telling the truth"" concerning ones beliefs, the [in]accuracy of the belief itself is moot.<p>Regardless of the justification, the sole purpose of a lie is deception. In PG's essay he points out reasons that we choose to deceive children, and the merits of those reasons are debatable. The author, and her parents, have taken the opposite tactic in child raising, which is admirable (imho).<p>Whether or not God exists, (which I believe undoubtedly that He does. Downmod if you'd like), when a parent answers a child's question concerning God in a fashion as described above...they are telling the truth. It does not matter one whit if they are right or not. As long as they believe what their answer is, they are not lying. In this particular case, the parents even go out of their way to point out that others believe otherwise, which is profitable for the child as well.<p>As a side note, I don't believe ""What's a prostitute?"" is a great example of a difficult question, and hardly worth lying to a child about.",1211690943

199336,comment,198732,198732,0,0,modoc,,,"I wouldn't let it stop you.  I've applied for and been offered numerous jobs which listed a college degree as a requirement (I don't have one).  It helps to have a good resume.  And by that I mean one that not only has lots of strong relevant job history, but also one that is well presented/written and really shows off your strengths, while minimizing things that might be liabilities (like the lack of a degree).  For instance, my resume doesn't even have an education section.<p>So don't let it stop you.  Also, as other people have mentioned, if you can duck HR, that's great too.  If you don't know anyone who works there, find one of their tech folks on a forum somewhere, and work in from that way.  Most places give employees hiring bonuses for referrals, so most people will be happy to help you get in the door (assuming they think you're good enough to want to work with you).<p>Personally, having worked at many places, I generally find folks with CS degrees to be liabilities.  Especially if they're relatively fresh out of college.  Granted I don't work in areas where you need lots of knowledge about machine learning, or AI, or...  I do Java-based web application development.<p>I've found that most CS programs, by nature of the need to identify topics, and build curriculums and supporting materials, are years behind the real world new technologies.  I'd rather hire/work with someone who had spent the last four years building cool things with the latest and greatest technologies.  Who knew the real world tips, tricks, and pitfalls of a given approach/language/toolkit/framework.  Rather than someone who'd spent the last 4 years in a classroom or a frat house, learning technology that is 1-6 years out of date, and didn't have hands-on-experience with how to handle a Slashdotting, or how to run a secure world facing server/postfix/whatever, or knew that Firefox treats xml response types very strictly and breaks on Google inserted AdSense javascript, unless you force the type to html (while IE and Safari don't care).<p>Don't get me wrong, there are some smart people in CS programs, or coming out of CS programs, but based on my working/hiring experience, in general, a CS degree is a slight liability on a resume from my point of view.<p>Real World Experience > College Degree.<p>And frankly, for the type of work I do, Real World Experience + College Degree usually == Real World Experience.",1211690037
199335,comment,198588,198653,0,0,brooksbp,,,"Nope, not at all.  The reason why I am slightly offended is that people are treating ""virtual interviews"" with the same seriousness as traditional, face-to-face interviews.  There will be no substitute for real human, spoken, face-to-face interviews; more to take out of a person like body language and emotion.  Human collaboration within a close environment is crucial to most aspects of business and production.  It is nothing more than silly for an individual to feel accomplishment from a job interview via SecondLife; feeling successful, bypassing face-to-face interaction.  Though, I feel this position might seem too harsh.",1211689923
199334,comment,199279,199320,0,0,natrius,,,"Even if there are differences between races in terms on intelligence, how could it ever be in their best interest to discriminate against certain groups of people? There is considerable overlap in the distributions of ability among races, so prejudging an individual based on their particular group's distribution doesn't ever make any sense.<p>If my hypothetical child asked about that, I would explain what we actually know about what causes differences in ability, such as socioeconomic factors.",1211689451
199333,comment,198732,199278,0,0,modoc,,,"I suspect the point is that having heard of and bothered to read one of her books, whether you liked or agreed with it or not, probably implies various things about you.<p>A) You socialize(d) with people who read things that aren't sold in the grocery store.<p>B) You not only know how to read, but most likely voluntarily read a 700+ page book in your spare time in order to learn/see what it was about/etc...<p>C) If you can speak about what was in the book, and what you thought about it, you can follow the plot of a 700+ page book, you can understand the points the author was making, perhaps you can intuit the not-very-subtle philosophical and societal messages she was delivering, and you can discuss how you agree or disagree with those messages.<p>It's no IQ test, but frankly it's probably a much better question than ""Do you have a degree?"".<p>At least I'd rather work with people who have read a book like that, and have an opinion on it's content and the author's points (even if they hated the book/points/etc...), than the average CS degree graduate.",1211689222
199332,comment,199231,199231,0,0,osipov,,,"This is a fascinating discussion, particularly in light of the human brain architecture. Back in school, my prof used to reference the distinctions between the left and right brains in context of alternative computing approaches used by each half. The right brain seems to be more in line with the statistical machine learning approach, effectively a black box data processor producing intuitive results from large quantities of data. The right brain works great in context of normal data distributions. The left brain is the logical brain and can override the right brain. The left brain is about language based reasoning and can handle the novel and unexpected situations or in other words the statistical outliers that give trouble to the right brain.",1211689194

But they were both highly talented and came highly recommended from people I trusted.<p>No, getting a CS degree doesn't guarantee that you're talented; far from it. However, it does show that you have enough aptitude to make it through a CS program, and it lessens the chance that you'll spend my time re-inventing -- or, worse yet, ignoring -- foundational concepts in computer science and software engineering.<p>Here are some more of my thoughts on the subject of hiring IT engineers:<p><a href=""http://brucefwebster.com/2008/01/10/the-wetware-crisis-tepes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brucefwebster.com/2008/01/10/the-wetware-crisis-tepes...</a><p><a href=""http://brucefwebster.com/2008/04/14/the-longest-yard-reorganizing-it-for-success/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brucefwebster.com/2008/04/14/the-longest-yard-reorgan...</a><p>(and thanks to dmv for the link to my 'Dead Sea' post, which is what led me here).  ..bruce..",1211688413

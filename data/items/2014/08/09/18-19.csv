Doing this causes a lot of confusion for Python beginners that write code in Python2 (i.e. it causes them to accidentally use old-style classes).  A better practice is to add the extra word i.e. &#x27;class ClassName(object):&#x27; for both Python2 and Python3 code.  This is especially true if you are writing Python tutorials.  Since we are going through this Python2 to Python3 transition it is better to minimize the differences in the cases where they don&#x27;t really matter (i.e. add the extra &#x27;object&#x27; word).",1407610652

8157691,comment,8156267,8157499,1,0,finder83,,,"The assumption here I think is that a book at $9.99 might attract people who wouldn&#x27;t buy it at $14.99. I&#x27;m probably one of those people, particularly with fiction books (computer science books/math books/etc are another issue). There are so many choices that are far below the $14.99 price, that unless it&#x27;s from a favorite author I&#x27;d happily pass up the higher price for another book, or another form of media (like a game). It doesn&#x27;t matter what other retailers offer the price at, $14.99 is simply too high for an e-book, and I only read fiction books as e-books. I might be the minority, but given the expertise of Amazon at selling books, I think that Amazon probably has a valid point.<p>You&#x27;re right though, that it doesn&#x27;t completely prove the point, but I think it definitely makes a point. People who wouldn&#x27;t buy the e-book at 14.99 are probably unlikely to go out and buy the same book from another retailer for 14.99. The question is if it really increases the market share of the book, or if instead lowering the price on amazon makes everyone who would buy the book would just go to amazon for the cheaper price. (Given that e-books cost nearly nothing to distribute, I would think that the price drop would pretty easily pay for itself though)",1407610526

8157657,comment,8152715,8152715,3,0,azakai,,,"> Now, what wrong with TrueNorth? My main criticism is that TrueNorth implements networks of integrate-and-fire spiking neurons. This type of neural net that has never been shown to yield accuracy anywhere close to state of the art on any task of interest (like, say recognizing objects from the ImageNet dataset). Spiking neurons have binary outputs (like neurons in the brain). The advantage of spiking neurons is that you don&#x27;t need multipliers (since the neuron states are binary). But to get good results on a task like ImageNet you need about 8 bit of precision on the neuron states. To get this kind of precision with spiking neurons requires to wait multiple cycles so the spikes &quot;average out&quot;. This slows down the overall computation.<p>Surely you can do this in the spatial domain instead of time? That is, each neuron is one bit, so you have 8 each computing one of the 8 bits he says are necessary? Perhaps the problem is using that value afterwards, I guess.",1407609990

8157601,comment,8156826,8157389,2,0,batbomb,,,"First off: Because this functionality is in HTTP spec itself, I believe it should be leveraged when it makes sense. Otherwise, why even bother with HTTP and response codes?<p>Secondly, because you don&#x27;t need to parse a JSON response to make decisions based on the response, both clients and servers can potentially be simpler and faster. If you got a 206 response and 1000 items back, but you made the request without an accept range header, not knowing if you were going to receive 10 items or 10000 items, you don&#x27;t need to parse the JSON to find this out. This is opposed to just retrieving a 200 response, parsing and processing 1000 items, getting to the end to find a &quot;next&quot; property in your JSON you weren&#x27;t expecting, and then firing off another request, when you could have already queued a second request if you had read the header first before processing your response. (RFC2616 Section 3.12 gives you some leverage in specifying range units, so its easy to define the range in items instead of bytes.)<p>However, I don&#x27;t think that creating new headers is a good idea. My recommendation is simple: If it&#x27;s in the HTTP spec and you are can use it according to how it&#x27;s defined (like my items range example), then you should use it. If it&#x27;s not in the spec, just go ahead and put it in the URI/response. The exceptions to that is maybe custom authentication mechanisms (i.e. HMAC or cookie based authentication), or anything which may be performance sensitive. For example, I have endpoints that are used in browser and by batch machines. It&#x27;s easy to just use cookies for the browser and HMAC for batch machines.",1407608965

When that happens, founders' first impulse is to correct them. But you can get a lot of value by allowing that uncomfortable misunderstanding to linger for a bit while you listen.<p><i>(edited to clarify some verb ownership and improve sentence pacing)</i>",1316519978

Hence, his advice is invalid when applied to a software business.<p>If you run a physical business, the only thing you need a programmer for is probably a website and an online ordering system. In that case, the founder doesn't need to learn programming, as that's not his business.<p>But when you're a saas startup or something, software <i>is</i> your business, and a non-technical founder should at least try to understand some of it.

For instance while I'm working in XCode I might inadvertently open a new techcrunch or nytimes page and start reading while XCode is compiling.  These brain context-switches are killing my productivity.<p>Is there some software solution that can create two virtual work environments for me?  Something that can ""sandbox"" my work stuff and do the same for my non-work stuff?<p>OSX Spaces comes close, but doesn't do true segragation for my brain to ""context-switch"" into work/non-work mode.  With Spaces the dock stays the same so I can easily click on some twitter client and start reading tweets.  Also if I open new window on an app (Chrome) that's already open in a ""non-work"" space than it'll go back to that non-work space.<p>I feel something will work if it will require effort for me to open that time-wasting page.  For instance if I use another computer strictly for non-work stuff then getting up and using that computer instead would do a ""context-switch"" in my brain to go into non-work mode.  Otherwise it's just too easy to open a time-wasting app.<p>Short of getting another laptop (or an iPad) for non-work stuff, does anyone have any hints/tips/ideas on a software solution on how to really separate work from non-work stuff so that switching to non-work mode requires some kind of effort?",1316519604

Some people are attracted to that.<p><i>For someone to get out of the way, he first has to be in the way. You make the general assumption that a manager is bad unless he actively changes his style. I cannot challenge this assumption for I have no data or ideas on where to find some concerning if managers are universally good or bad. And even then employee satisfaction might not be the only metric to measure success. Although I do think that having fun at work is one of the most, if not the most important metric.

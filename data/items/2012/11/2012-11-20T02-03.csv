4807502,comment,4806732,4806944,8,0,jrockway,,,"I think he wants a non-boilerplate way of doing operation b only if operation a succeeds.  Instead of writing:<p><pre><code>   result = operation_a()
   if not result:
       return ERROR
   result = operation_b()
   if not result:
       return ERROR
   return result
</code></pre>
He wants to write:<p><pre><code>   operation_a()
   return operation_b()
</code></pre>
This is a logical thing to want, because the program is not semantically correct if operation b executes after a failed operation a.  It is correct, however, if a failing operation_a causes the entire routine to fail by bailing out early.  So it would make sense that that be the simplest thing to write, and then make the case where you ignore errors from operation_a be the thing that's a lot of lines of code.<p>Ultimately, it's a problem of not enough abstraction.  Users of traditional programming languages are held hostage by the control-flow abstractions that the language designers put in place.  But if they weren't, then they'd simply write the top code block and call it ""combine_failing_operations"" or something and they'd write their program in terms of combine_failing_operations:<p><pre><code>   combine_failing_operations(
       operation_a,
       operation_b)
</code></pre>
Of course, combine_failing_operations is itself a failing operation, so one can also write:<p><pre><code>   combine_failing_operations(
       combine_failing_operations(
           operation_a,
           operation_b),
       operation_c)
</code></pre>
The reason why people don't is because the resulting code is ugly and it's not encouraged by the langauge's style guide (which usually says, ""I'm the programming language designer, if there's missing functionality it's because the functionality is wrong"").<p>In languages where function application is the only syntax, though, this pattern shows up all the time.<p>For example, in Haskell, you normally combine two functions with the . operator.  (f . g) x = f(g(x)).  It follows that if you want to combine two functions that can fail, you'll just write that function.  Haskell does exactly this and even gives you some syntax sugar: if you call your function >>=, then you can write:<p><pre><code>   do
     operation_a
     operation_b
</code></pre>
instead of ""combine_failing_operations operation_a operation_b"", which means you get both pretty code <i>and</i> context-specific only-written-once correctness.<p>Semantically this is what Go does, but the syntax isn't as nice.  (Exceptions are certainly irritating when applied to Go's concurrency model, but at least they are fail-safe.  I don't trust myself to get every line of code 100% correct, and I <i>want</i> my program to crash when it gets into a state I didn't write code to handle.  Go makes this harder than it should.)",1353379455

Dropbox access is available through a free app named ""New File Manager v2"", for example. I don't know if he just didn't put in the effort to look for them or purposely used the ""official"" wording to paint the picture he wanted to, but it's somewhat misleading.",1353377579

When kids are thought not to ask any question or to challenge the professor, it is unlikely you will end up with an environment where entrepreneurs will flourish and thrive. The society in Japan is also very effective in making sure everyone fits the same mold.<p>This being said, there is still fascination for entrepreneurs in Japan. There is one TV program I watch every week, called ""Canbria Kyuden"" (Palace Cambria) discussing exclusively stories of Japanese entrepreneurs based on new market insights. They review large and small corporations alike and this is a very famous program here in Japan. It is probably ""edgy"" in a way, but I guess the interest/public is there as well.",1353377405

Pg encourages those readers who are still studying to take classes unrelated to their CS major so that they may see more problems worth solving, but what struck e about this paragraph was how much, for me, college was like living in the future.  In the late nineties, I lived in an environment where every single member of my social circle had an always-on 10 Mbit connection to the Internet and spent inordinate amounts of time communicating via email, IM etc.  It seems like no coincidence that so many successful Internet companies were born out of students of that era.  I doubt that today's students encounter the future of much at all in their dorm rooms.  Perhaps universities should be working hard to make sure that campus living is more like living in the future than setting up mobile app development courses, incubators etc etc.",1353377357

That only ever applied to media content (if it has DRM).<p>You can install apps on as many devices as you want and redownload them as often as you want. They are bound to your account, not specific devices. If you, for example, set up a new iOS device you can just pick your iCloud backup from another device on startup and your new device will automatically download all your apps from the App Store.<p>Mac App Store apps are similar: You can download them (as often as you want) and use them on as many Macs you own or control. They are bound to your account, not your Mac. (The sole exception might be certain iLife apps like iPhoto that come for free with your Mac.

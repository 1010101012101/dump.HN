The reason this happens is because there are many people who write proprietary software which will help users do powerful things but the software will also have various restrictions that result in helpless servitude and social division. Stallman teaches that users who choose to accept these proprietary software with the restrictions cannot live in freedom as users are forbidden to control the proprietary software, the control over the software belongs to the owner of the proprietary software.",1419670610

8802110,comment,8792778,8801594,0,0,blahblah7777,,,"In the case of Italy, I would also doubt (as you do) that a hypothetical “North Italy” would choose anything other than Italian as its official language, because the use of Italian goes back a lot further than the unification of Italy, and it’s the obvious and easy choice as a national language.  The government simply doesn’t care about the regional languages dying out, and there’s no reason to think that a new North Italian government would have a different viewpoint.  The main motivation, in the case of Italy, was just to have everyone speaking the same language.<p>However, it’s certainly possible for a country and a population to completely change language in a generation.  The Italian generation of people that is now about 60 years old are effectiviely bilingual—they were taught in Italian at school, but (generally) spoke their regional language at home.  The generation after that spoke only Italian, and the generation before that spoke only the regional language.  (Obviously this is a bit of a generalisation.)  So it’s quite straightforward for a country to change it’s language over the course of 20 years or so.<p>I have a colleague in the Netherlands who believes that the Netherlands will at some point adopt English as its official language.  I personally doubt it, but it is nevertheless definitely <i>possible</i>.  All it would take is for the government to decree that all schoolchildren be taught <i>in English</i> at school.  Dutch people (and particularly Dutch school-teachers, which is the important thing) would easily be able to carry that policy out.  The first generation of schoolchildren to pass through to adulthoold would probably choose to speak in English as their primary language, as has happened in Italy.<p>Also Brussels has changed from a Flemish speaking city to a French speaking one in a short space of time.",1419670565

I&#x27;ve heard it described as a memory machine, and also as a machine with 65,536 registers.<p>In any case, it&#x27;s easier and more efficient to perform register allocation from an intermediate language with a huge number of registers down to a small number of physical registers than it is to assign slot locations to registers.  See Michael Franz&#x27;s SafeTSA [1] project for an example of modifying a JVM to be able to mix and match both Java bytecode and an SSA-based bytecode in the same process.  Granted SSA has some additional properties besides an infinite register set that make code generation nice.  However, they found that it took less time to generate native code from SafeTSA and that the generated native code ran faster, even though the JIT backend was identical for the two bytecode formats.  The disadvantage of SSA and memory machine bytecodes is they are more complicated to efficiently interpret if you&#x27;re not generating native code from them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SafeTSA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SafeTSA</a>",1419670346

While it takes eons of evolution to significantly alter the resources most animals require, humans can (and have) dramatically altered this quantity in the space of a single lifetime.  Failure to sufficiently account for this is a likely cause of failure for the doomsayers.<p>At the same time, one has to be aware of the terrible nature of exponential growth. A planet that seems half empty is just one population doubling from being full, and our population has been doubling in significantly less than a single lifetime for quite a while now.

8802090,comment,8799127,8800148,0,0,vipstarry,,,"Freedom means having control over your own life. If you use a program to carry out activities in your life, your freedom depends on your having control over the program. Nonfree software encourages users to surrender control over their computing to someone else and this is the exact same situation in SAAS. SAAS is not controlled by the user but some other person. This is unethical because this causes an unjust form of power over the user. Users who partake in SAAS or proprietary software do not get all four freedoms of free software that all users need to have freedom. Now if you feel that you don&#x27;t need all four freedoms of free software, then so be it but beware, your computing will not belong to your hands but it will belong to the hands of other people (who don&#x27;t necessarily have your best interest in mind).<p>In a restaurant, there is no unjust power over the customer. In a restaurant, a customer can order some dishes and order the dishes to be prepared a particular way.

8802044,comment,8801678,8801678,0,0,chroma,,,"I&#x27;ve made this point before, but I feel compelled to repeat it in response to this post. The late Christopher Hitchens, in one of his greatest orations[1], made some excellent points about free speech:<p><i>...it’s not just the right of the person who speaks to be heard. It is the right of everyone in the audience to listen, and to hear. And every time you silence someone you make yourself a prisoner of your own action, because you deny yourself the right to hear something. In other words: Your own right to hear and be exposed is as much involved in all these cases as is the right of the other to voice his or her view.</i><p>In other words, freedom of speech is really about freedom of hearing. Later, he asks who should be trusted with the job of censoring:<p><i>Who&#x27;s going to decide? To whom do you award the right to decide which speech is harmful or who is the harmful speaker, or to determine in advance what are the harmful consequences going to be, that we know enough about in advance to prevent? To whom would you give this job? To whom are you going to award the task of being the censor?</i><p><i>Did you hear any speaker in opposition to this motion (eloquent as... one of them was) to whom you would delegate the task of deciding for you, what you could read? To whom you&#x27;d give the job of deciding for you, relieve you of the responsibility of hearing what you might have to hear? Do you know anyone- hands up- to whom you would give this job? Does anyone have a nominee? You mean there&#x27;s no one in Canada good enough to decide what I can read? Or hear? I had no idea... but there’s a law that says there must be such a person. Or there&#x27;s a subsection of some piddling law that says it. Well to hell with that law then. It&#x27;s inviting you to be liars and hypocrites and to deny what you evidently already know already.</i><p>And finally, he notes that religious texts contain passages that would need to be censored, yet religious conservatives often call for censorship.<p><i>Look anywhere you like for the warrant for slavery, for the subjugation of women as chattel, for the burning and flogging of homosexuals, for ethnic cleansing, for antisemitism, for all this you look no further than a famous book that&#x27;s on every pulpit in this city and in every synagogue and in every mosque. And then just see whether you can square the fact that the force that is the main source of hatred is also the main caller for censorship. And when you&#x27;ve realized this you&#x27;ll therefore this evening be faced with a gigantic false antithesis. I hope that still won&#x27;t stop you from giving the motion before you the resounding endorsement that it deserves. Thanks awfully. Night-night. Stay cool!</i><p>(If you haven&#x27;t watched the whole speech, I recommend doing so. I&#x27;ve only transcribed a few choice passages, but the whole thing is great.)<p>And of course, there&#x27;s the absurdity factor. Nobody thinks that censoring actually stops people from endorsing verboten opinions or talking about banned topics. Everything just gets driven underground. This gives the holders of censored beliefs an excuse to behave more extremely than they otherwise would. After all, they&#x27;re being persecuted.<p>1. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIyBZNGH0TY#t=1240"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIyBZNGH0TY#t=1240</a>",1419667790

And since you missed the point, I cited it because it directly contradicts your claims that the extradition is being made in order for Sweden to charge Assange.<p>Indeed, as you would know had you bothered to look at other extradition cases, the legal reality is that Sweden can charge Assange anytime it wants. As stated above, the problem with doing this is that it would require the prosecution to have actual evidence of wrongdoing and eliminate their ability to hold Assange in indefinite detention.<p>> This is simply false and I&#x27;m kind of surprised that you&#x27;d make this claim.<p>Again, you are factually wrong. What the court &quot;evaluated&quot; was the allegation in the warrant, with the description and context of the charge taken at face value from the request of the Swedish prosecutor. There was no or only an extremely limited ability for Assange to face his accusers, challenge the evidence, or request supporting evidence from the Swedish prosecution. And yet you somehow managed to conclude that (1) there is evidence supporting any of these claims, and (2) Assange would be convicted of rape on the strength of that evidence. Bullocks.<p>> I&#x27;m not sure why you keep going off on this tangent<p>I&#x27;ll take this as evidence you can&#x27;t find a single commensurate case of extradition, although that was already a foregone conclusion. So let me close by saying that you should be ashamed of having defended such an irregular abuse of the legal system, and doubly-so for now arguing with a straight face that anything legal is by definition moral.

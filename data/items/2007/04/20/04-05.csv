Thats why people get their information on the Internet.<p>I think magazines still have value. People need something to read in bed, on the bus and on the toilet. Until I have an iPhone that I can do this with, I will read magazines. <p>I think magazines are on the way out, but they still have value for now...",1177043953

I realize that this site is vary good press/PR for YC, but the value that its providing to me personally is incredible and the interactivity has me hooked. This is the best site that I have come across in the past 2 years.",1177043581

14940,comment,14586,14588,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"others have summed it up pretty well, with the ""no false positives"" perspective.  But, I will play devil's advocate and say: Make sure you aren't just looking for ""someone like me"", and finding no one measures up.  I've noticed this in some younger founders...there's a pair of folks who are nearly identical in skills, history, and goals, and this is not necessarily a good mix for success in a startup.  They get along great, but they aren't a good team.<p>You both need the same drive to build something great.  But you need to have different skills, different areas you enjoy working on.  If you don't, you'll fight over the mythical bike shed and the hard solitary work won't get done.  And there's a lot of hard solitary work in a startup.",1177042480

Solutions become a lot simpler because you are utilising more of the framework, less custom code leaving more time to solve the real problems.",1177042009
14937,comment,14605,14777,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"You're still missing the point.  Joins and sorting and grouping in SQL are what you use to populate the real data structures.  Whether you know it or not, in all but the most simplistic CRUD application, you've gotta write code to deal with all of those data structures.  The database is always in addition to that complexity.  The argument being made is that you can leave out the database entirely in some environments, and not add that complexity.<p>The entirety of this thread is questioning the pervasive use of databases in web applications.  There are some where it makes excellent sense (accounting, CRM, ERP, the stuff that's been the strong-hold of Oracle and SAS for years).  And others (wikis, blogs, forums, photo galleries, etc.) where it may not make good sense, because you introduce hundreds of unnecessary operations and significant additional database support code.  That's not to say a database is never the right solution for these problems (when your problem starts looking relational, you should start looking at relational databases, because your Ruby or Python or Lisp implementation is going to be worse than what PostgreSQL or MySQL have).  And, as someone else mentioned (but got modded down)...when you start building your own flaky transactional layer, then it may be time to consider a database that has good transactions support.",1177041668
14936,comment,14935,14935,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"How many start-ups sabotage their chances by being too stingy when it comes to equity?<p>I thought I'd save everyone the trouble of going to a blog by ranting here directly.<p>A while back I was interviewing at a small company that really needed another developer or\nthree.  They wanted to hire and made an offer -- a 20k pay cut, <i>but</i> they were going to\ngive me equity -- the magic word!  Except the president/founder of the company wanted to\nkeep 99%+ of the equity for himself, so anyone else let in on the deal had to share a\nfraction of the remaining 1%.  I calculated that if the company was successful to the tune\nof $10 million, my share would still be worth less than my initial pay cut.  I\npointed this out to the senior developer who was trying to convince me to join, but his\nblind loyalty to the company seemed to preclude arithmetic.<p>Prior to that I worked at another smallish company where the president/owner kept around\n95% of the stock.  A few top people got 1% or less.  Other companies say they want to hire\n""top talent"", but they pay ""market rates"" -- which usually means the average according to\nsome salary survey, or less, and no equity.<p>It seems like some founders are so attached to ownership that they can't part with it, even\nif it means greater success for themselves!  It's like they have visions of dollars from\nowning the entire company instead of a vision of what's needed to get there.  While a\nfraction of a percent of Google is worth a lot now, in order to get to that point, the\nfounders had to part with the majority of the equity.<p>Some start-ups work with two founders, but some have half a dozen (like Excite) or more.\nEven reddit got more ""founders"" after the fact.  If it turns out you need a new band\nmember, are you prepared to redo the original founders' percentages, or do you have other plans?",1177041614

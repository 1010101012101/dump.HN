Even if it were useful, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much of a chance that adtech companies will build out STUN servers to handle the kind of traffic they do just track down the 0.001% of users who do not accept third-party cookies. Can you even do WebRTC from an iframe?<p>Browser fingerprinting is absolute FUD. It makes no sense for advertisers, and it&#x27;s pretty useless for anyone else, too. Every time I visit the EFF site that checks my fingerprint, it tells me I&#x27;m still unique.

It seems ridiculous that one person should have any expectation they (no matter how well known they are to the community) can stand up in a crowd of 7 billion people and say &quot;hold on, let&#x27;s stop and think about what we&#x27;re doing&quot;.  This assumes all 7 billion (or even most of them) are not thinking before doing, or can&#x27;t possibly be certain about what they&#x27;re doing without express written consent of OP.<p>Just because one person can&#x27;t possibly keep up with all that is happening in the world doesn&#x27;t mean everyone should feel obligated to stop to allow them to catch up.<p>OP also seems to imply it&#x27;ll be near impossible to reverse out of what is going into the web, no matter how good or bad those decisions are.  I think it&#x27;s a bad assumption.  Things will continue to move forward.  Whether that means one company or two decide to take two steps back is another question, but in general the web will (and should) continue moving forward.

9965633,comment,9961537,9965056,0,0,eropple,,,"Packer severely frustrates me, with the maddening regularity in which it fails just for funsies. Or the consistent but completely inane ways that it fails, like refusing to proceed based on not finding a builder for an &#x27;only&#x27; or &#x27;except&#x27; clause (making it nearly impossible to re-use provisioners and post-provisioners across multiple projects). Racker does help--my shared Racker scripts are in a Ruby gem--though I think that it pretty much removes Packer as anything more than a dummy solution into which you dump directives on a per-builder basis. As a tool that you carefully feed the bare minimum of information to do its job in any specific situation, though, it works okay.<p>Terraform, on the other hand, I think is a huge, huge mess, and I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re going to fix it. I wrote a Ruby DSL for it the last time I tried to use it in anger, only to encounter that Terraform didn&#x27;t honor its own promises around the config language it insisted on instead of YAML or a full-featured DSL of its own. Current client uses it, and every point release adds new and exciting bugs and regressions in stuff that should be caught by the most trivial of QA. For AWS, I strongly recommend my friend Sean&#x27;s Cfer[1] as a better solution; CloudFormation&#x27;s kind of gross, but Cfer helps.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://github.com/seanedwards/cfer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/seanedwards/cfer</a>",1438130927

The body may also have additional processing power like a GPU, additional cores, etc, to turn it into a higher-class machine.<p>Due to the mobile form factor there are certain use cases that it simply can not fit while still being a &quot;phone&quot;. This is not because the phone will lack processing power, it&#x27;s literally because the form factor just can&#x27;t have enough input & output options. Barring major battery upgrades, it also literally lacks the power to solve all problems. The extra hardware will also have laptop- or desktop-class heat dissipation capabilities, which a smart phone simply can not solve without, again, being something other than a phone when it&#x27;s being a phone.<p>That is all to say, there are real and specific reasons that phones can&#x27;t eat all the use cases the way minicomputers ate mainframes and desktops ate minicomputers. The only way for phones to eat all the use cases is to hybridize &quot;back&quot; a step and also become the things it is replacing again.<p>We&#x27;ve seen some abortive attempts at this. I find myself wondering if the fundamentally closed nature of the major phone operating systems is inhibiting the creation of this stuff, because the requisite OS changes to make this work are too hard. While I don&#x27;t own one I still find myself rooting for the Firefox phone or the Ubuntu phone... they&#x27;ve still got a chance to beat the other guys to this market. And I for one would hate to sacrifice the openness of my entire computing stack because &quot;the phone&quot;, which at this point will be little more than &quot;one particular app&quot;, is closed. That&#x27;s an awful lot to sacrifice to an increasingly minor use case.",1438128879

Why go to all the separate websites? Why have an app for EACH new agency. I can search, sort, see when articles were published, all from the comfort of a single web page or desktop client! RSS even seemed to have pretty wide adoption. That orange button was everywhere! My non-techie friends even used Google Reader circa 2006-2008.<p>However, my love of RSS is really just a historic relic of becoming interested in computers between 2001 and 2005. Before that was Usenet and other technologies I&#x27;m probably unaware of. RSS has since been replaced by Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Tumblr, Google Plus, etc. Someone needs to pay the bills and it&#x27;s a lot easier to monetize when you keep users in your walled gardens and control what they see. These newer technologies are also MUCH easier to use for the average consumer and have the net-benefit of being &quot;social&quot; which is likely beneficial for the ad conglomerates.<p>Companies who create (or curate or distribute) content are fundamentally at odds with their users. Users want relevant, high quality, add-free content, but most are not willing to pay for it. If they do, they expect a fine-tuned user experience or physical product (a magazine or Amazon Kindle for example). Even paid subscription magazines (NewScientist, Time, etc.) have ads to help keep their pricing competitive and increase quarterly profits for investors. Hell, even my Kindle (which I PAID for) came with ads. Granted, Amazon gave me the ability to remove them for $20. But, that gives you an idea of how valuable ads are. I never understood why more websites didn&#x27;t just include ads in their RSS feeds. Easier to filter out? Less control since the user isn&#x27;t visiting the site?<p>I&#x27;d be MORE than willing to pay for RSS or NNTP feeds of high quality content. To me, there is no better user experience than reading format-free text and images in Gnus, but I imagine I&#x27;m in the minority. Average consumers (my parents, non-tech friends, etc.) are more than willing to visit cnn.com in their browsers or dedicated phone app. Most people simply don&#x27;t care enough. I feel like I&#x27;m constantly trying to chase the conversation of the topics I&#x27;m interested in by stringing together mostly-incompatible technologies and work flows.<p>I&#x27;d really just like the ability to read, annotate, comment on, share, and discuss media with people who are also interested.",1438128336

There is a short video as introduction which doesn&#x27;t tell much, I&#x27;d much prefer a random video from the series.<p>Now by making these private, no one will find this from youtube, other sites won&#x27;t link it and there is no playlist so I will have to click each url every 5 minutes or so, which is not the end of the world, but not fun.<p>He could have asked for my email for the project files(videos and project files get sent to your email currently as I understand it), and gave videos for free. Anyone actually interested in this would definitely give their email for the files. If he wants my email to teach me something else later -- or sell me something, I think someone who entered their mail while watching the series will be more interested in what he could use the emails for, and now he won&#x27;t be able to reach these kinds of people from random views, in exchange for the initial email count.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a nice deal, but I have no data, so just an opinion. Maybe something to consider.",1438128028

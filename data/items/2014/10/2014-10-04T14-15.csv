(Something like 40% of US rail tonnage-miles from coal, while it&#x27;s about 15% of the EU&#x27;s.)",1412434791

Your skills, the market you can reach, and the broader market are all changing. Indeed, it&#x27;s your job to expand the first two.<p>Treat this as a set of experiments. Try setting your price at $15/hour. Can you sell all the hours you want? Great, then tell the next client who asks that your price is $25/hr. Eventually you will discover a level that keeps you as busy as you want.<p>At that point you may, if you like, start asking how you can bill even more. New skills? Better marketing? Different clients? Building a team? Alternatively, you can just keep plugging away.",1412434766

They are only <i>side</i> effects if you&#x27;re not able to encode the effects in the type of the function.  Haskell doesn&#x27;t treat effects as <i>less</i> important, it treats them as <i>more</i> important by allowing (and, as a consequence, forcing) you to reason about them explicitly in compiler-checked ways.  This lets you do great things like have STM transactions with a guarantee that retrying them won&#x27;t screw anything up.  It also lets you define your own kinds of effects that you want to track and plumb them through your system in a coherent way.  And it lets you write code that doesn&#x27;t care what kind of effects it&#x27;s working with, and yet which can still be used in contexts like STM that need to apply restrictions.",1412434736

It may sound silly, but to me what makes the difference is the event itself.  Being a tourist at a museum, natural landmark and so can feel <i>so</i> much different than being a tourist at a local watering hole.  Taking a natural landmark as an example, I view it as if the locals can&#x27;t claim it as their own and it&#x27;s meant to be shared and interpreted by the world.  Museums are practically enablers for tourism so locals can&#x27;t be upset about that.<p>But, when it comes to a local food or drink joint, tucked away in a neighborhood of sub-cultures, I can&#x27;t help but feel as if I&#x27;m intruding.  To focus on the experience at a place known as being &quot;best authentic food X in city Y&quot; or &quot;great neighborhood bar, one of the best in city Y&quot; is to focus on the brick and mortar, the customers, the employees.  Given just the right media attention or online review a place can become a tourist petri dish and the atmosphere can be entirely thrown off.  Although, there sits the problem as without at least <i>some</i> attention I wouldn&#x27;t have known about it.<p>That probably comes across as selfish, but it&#x27;s not about me.  There&#x27;s many cases where a place becomes successful, patronage changes, ownership ends up changing hands a year or two later, and the place isn&#x27;t what it used to be.

Other languages just wrap the native C API call, GetVersionEx.<p>The most troubled framework is Java: because of some strange design decision, you can only get the version <i>as a string</i> (see [3]), and that makes impressively easy for programmers to screw up version checks.

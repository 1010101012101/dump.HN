6972817,comment,6972163,6972163,1,0,acjohnson55,,,"I have mixed feelings about this article. First of all, I strongly support the dissemination of the knowledge that race has little-to-no basis in biology. I think every American should be taught this. I&#x27;m a black person, and I wasn&#x27;t taught this until take a college course that specifically concerned race and ethnicity.<p>But I disagree that we&#x27;d all be better off if we just forgot about race altogether. Despite the lack of basis in biology, race is actually a real thing, even if it is merely a social construct. Race is real in both self-identification and in how we perceive and treat others.<p>Culture alone does not explain everything. There is no unified culture shared by all Americans who self-identify as black. And yet, there are aspects of the experience of living in this country that are quite common to black people. This is because the racial identity other people ascribe to you also affects your life.",1388181482

6972795,comment,6971249,6972146,1,0,Mithaldu,,,"An interesting nuance, which many early Perl teaching books up until Modern Perl [1] failed to address properly is &quot;context&quot;. Perl allows both single and multi-value function return. In return the function can ask whether the calling statement expects a single or multiple values. Additionally, this request for expectation propagates through the call stack from the first statement where this can be correctly determined, to the place where the question was asked.<p>This makes it possible to do things like this:<p><pre><code>   my $first = max( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 );\n\n   my ( $first, $second, $third ) = max( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 );\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=\"http://onyxneon.com/books/modern_perl/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://onyxneon.com/books/modern_perl/</a>",1388181143

See Java.<p>I do not think of Java as a language with few nuances. Null references, broken covariance for arrays, two non-orthogonal notions of modularity (class-based: public, protected and private; package-based: default visibility), value semantics for primitives vs. reference semantics for everything else... it is all very nuanced! Plus, for all the supposed rigidity, you can break type safety via reflection.<p>On the other hand, Haskell and Standard ML (especially the latter!) strike me as very simple languages, with a far more rigid notion of safety than Java programmers could ever dream of, but which nevertheless afford lots of expressivity.

6972667,comment,6972154,6972564,14,0,astral303,,,"IMO, Spotify has some really large gaps in usability.<p>In general, there is no good concept of a music collection (despite the UI having words &quot;Collection&quot; and &quot;Library&quot; in it). While you don&#x27;t own albums in Spotify, I still sorely miss that concept. Starring entire albums makes for a fairly useless/unwieldy Starred playlist, so that&#x27;s a no go. I&#x27;ve resorted to starring single songs, then later selecting a song from the starred list and then switching to playing the whole album (if I starred the first track of the album, I have to select another album track, then back to first track, to make it play the album and not just continue on the Starred playlist).<p>Basically, where&#x27;s my damn list of Artists and Albums I&#x27;ve liked? In iTunes (or mp3 folders back in the day), I would scan the list of artists and select an album to play.<p>No, I do not want to have an all songs/genre playlist and then  sort by artist and then page thru pages of tracks.<p>The mobile app has poor information architecture. Going back to the starred playlist (or any other playlist) takes 6 taps if I&#x27;m on the info screen.<p>Oh, I freaking hate the mobile info screen. To me, it always feels awkward to hit the song name at the bottom to bring up the &quot;now playing&quot; screen, then tapping &quot;i&quot; to show the info screen, just to select the album or the artist of the song I&#x27;m listening to. As far as I can tell, the whole point of the &quot;i&quot; button is to allow me to see the album art--but, bizarrely, seeing album art is the default (so always requires an extra tap to do anything related to artist or album).<p>Basically, it&#x27;s a damn tapfest. It&#x27;s frustrating when you want to switch songs or do some navigation quickly--for example, while in the gym on an elliptical or while running.<p>Also, there is no search history and the app is forgetful. Periodically, at unknown intervals, the mobile app forgets the album/song I was playing, and I have to re-enter a long artist name all over again. Not to mention there is no fuzzy search. Yeah, try spelling &quot;Irresistible Force&quot; correctly, quickly.<p>There are the things that make Spotify merely a very convenient music discovery service, as opposed to a complete, fulfilling replacement to owning your own music library.<p>Finally, there is general bugs, like crashing and streaming getting stuck now and again, which can be very frustrating in the middle of an album (the next song streams, this song is stuck).",1388179200

6972662,comment,6971025,6972300,1,0,Scienz,,,"Those are good suggestions, but I&#x27;d mention that it&#x27;s much easier for me now to analyze my situation in retrospect, understand what happened and the mistakes I made, and turn it into a cohesive narrative. At the time I didn&#x27;t really understand why I was doing poorly or what the root causes were, so while I did seek &quot;support&quot; on a number of occasions, it didn&#x27;t help. I simply assumed I wasn&#x27;t smart enough to graduate, much less do physics. In retrospect I see this obviously wasn&#x27;t true, since I&#x27;m happily reading a quantum field theory book in my spare time now and, as I said before, ended up being one of the better students in some of my classes. But if you&#x27;d asked me at the time I&#x27;d have probably just rambled a bunch of guesses and speculation. I suppose my point is that, even following those suggestions, some people will still fall through the cracks. And also that most of these institutions are just bureaucratic monoliths that aren&#x27;t built to be flexible with every students particular needs and such. The bias there tends to be heavily towards the institutions, too, since students who do poorly are just deemed slackers or unfit for college, instead of considering it a systemic or structural aspect of the system that favors certain people and situations over others. Even the stereotypical &quot;partiers&quot; who drink their way through college could be viewed as a systemic result of a toxic social environment. I believe there was another comment here to the effect of &quot;this is college and you&#x27;re done with baby hand-holding,&quot; which is true in one sense, but it shouldn&#x27;t be used as an excuse to disregard anyone doing badly in the system or a particular school as acceptable attrition for a just-good-enough educational system.",1388179129

This takes the reader from &quot;Ok, I get how computers do their thing...&quot; to &quot;Ok, I see how <i>this</i> type of computer does its thing.&quot; At the end of the day I felt that both were important concepts, the how, and the how to match with existing practice concepts.<p>That said, my board design that goes along with this has an FPGA which is there to implement a simple frame buffer. That was before I found the STM32F429 which has its own simple frame buffer, and so I&#x27;m digressing at the moment trying to figure out if I should go that route or not. One of the benefits of having the FPGA on board was that for some definition of &quot;easy&quot; you do some stuff in the FPGA, the scare quotes though are there because FPGAs bring their own pile of complexity to the problem and that defeats some of my goals of keeping it only as complex as it needs to be.",1388178549

It was Fujimoto who flew to France to supply the Dear Leader&#x27;s yearly $700,000 cognac habit.

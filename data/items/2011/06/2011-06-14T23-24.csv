People are going to have disagreements about changes, and there needs to be some method of adjudicating those disagreements. Democracy is near-impossible in those circumstances because key problems like suffrage (who counts as enough of a contributor to have a vote?) are hard to fix, and because actual technical expertise is important to decision-making. Wikipedia is probably the best example of a project that's run democratically, by consensus at least, and the net result is that more effort is wasted on politicking than actually writing content. The only reason this even works for Wikipedia is because there's no shortage of people who can write and copyedit encyclopedia articles. Programmers are more scarce, and more allergic to politics.<p>So benevolent dictatorship it is, plus the freedom to fork. As for Rails, changes like using jQuery instead of Prototype (pre-3.1), or using HAML or something like that doesn't actually require making any code changes. In fact, these controversies are classic bikeshed arguments. It's not a serious criticism of Rails that the default gemfile doesn't include a gem you prefer, because you can change the gemfile yourself. It would be a serious criticism of Rails--and, indeed, a reason to fork--if, for instance, there was strong disagreement with how Arel is implemented.

Eventually I can pay off the mortgage with it when it hits $1000.  Conversely, if it drops to approximately zero, I can write off 3% of my net worth as entertainment expense.<p>But I'm not comfortable holding 100% of my assets in Bitcoin.  I prefer to have an assortment of fiat currencies, metals, food, stocks, supplies, etc.<p>I would really like to see a digital asset which is contractually redeemable for electric power, issued by a reputable producer.  I could easily see allocating 10% of my net worth to such a thing.  Because it's redeemable, I don't have to worry about what ""merchants"" or ""exchangers"" might accept it.  I wouldn't care, because I know I can always redeem it directly for electricity under the terms of the contract.<p>And I don't mean ""dollars worth of"" electricity either.  I mean redeemable for a specific number of kilowatt-hours, regardless of what the ""price"" of that power might be in the future when measured in dollars.  The word ""dollar"" is nowhere to be found in the contract.<p>Bitcoin's cool.  When I read the white paper a couple of years ago, I emailed Satoshi congratulating him on the achievement.  But Bitcoin is just <i>one</i> asset on this earth among many.  Each asset has its own unique bundle of properties which make it variably desirable at different times for different people.<p>Gold and silver in the hand are durable, hold their purchasing power well over the long term, and can be traded <i>offline</i>.  But that doesn't mean I'm going to put 100% of my net worth in gold and silver.<p>Digital gold and silver have the advantage of allowing trade over long distances.  The downside is that you're relying on a redemption contract from an issuer who holds the assets on bailment.  It's all trade-offs.<p>Fiat paper currency in the hand is fairly durable but doesn't hold its purchasing power quite as well.  However, it is very easy to trade it for real goods and services, and it too can be traded offline.  More trade-offs.<p>Digital deposit fiat currency has its own advantages and disadvantages which I need not belabor.<p>Bitcoin has the advantage of allowing trade over long distances, and without a central server, and without relying on any issuer to make good on a contractual redemption obligation.  The downside is that ... you can't literally redeem it for anything, and must rely on a network of merchants and exchangers who may or may not wish to trade it for something you want at any given moment.  More trade-offs.<p>Freeze-dried food has the advantage that you can actually eat the stuff.  It can be traded offline, but it's not very liquid.  It is fairly durable, though not as durable as metals.  You can't trade it over long distances, unless you digitize claims on it.  Then you're back to central servers and redemption contracts.<p>Ammunition has similar advantages, except for the purposes of defense and hunting instead of eating.  Its value has even been rising relative to <i>gold</i> over the past several years.<p>The point of this long screed is to emphasize that there is no One True Asset into Which All of One's Wealth on Earth Must be Vested.  I myself am a lazy old asset allocator, and I like to choose a variety of percentage numbers which add up to 100 and then stick with it.  No single one of those numbers is 100, but I do occasionally use 0.  But that too is a conscious decision <i>not</i> to own a particular thing at all.",1308094487

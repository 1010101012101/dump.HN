7529364,comment,7519827,7521410,3,0,ndeine,,,"The expression 52x/x has a restricted domain as well (x /= 0). But that&#x27;s normally not what you mean when you write it. It isn&#x27;t often you really care about expressions like 52x/x; they are generally just intermediate steps in getting to a real solution.<p>For example: I have done a lot of work on some equation that is interesting to me, and finally I have reduced it to 5+yx=52x+5. Now obviously the rules of algebra let me subtract 5 from each side and be left with yx=52x, and this subtraction also has no effect on the domains for which our variables may be defined. All is well.<p>But dividing out the x is what we are concerned with now. Surely y=52 is a solution to the equation - why can this not be true for all values of x?<p>Well, for nonzero x we have y=52 and nobody will complain. For x=0, though, solving for y is problematic. Note that if x=0, y could be 1, or 33, or any number. If there is some function f such that y=f(x), then it follows that f(x) holds a unique value y for each input of x/=0, but for x=0 we cannot know what y might be; this is what we mean by undefined. Thus we say the domain of f(x) is the set of all real numbers x, such that x is not equal to zero.<p>If you have been told otherwise, or even gotten away with doing algebra or calculus under the assumption that the domain of our function f may include zero, you are taking a mathematical shortcut rather than performing formal analysis. It is not calculus nor algebra that is broken by saying f is undefined for x=0, but rather your (albeit practically useful) misconception of these systems.<p>I&#x27;ll finish with some formal rules of algebra, to hammer this in:<p>- [P6] Existence of a multiplicative identity: a * 1 = 1 * a = a ; 1 /= 0.<p>- [P7] Existence of multiplicative inverses: a * a^(-1) = a^(-1) * a = 1, for a /= 0.<p>These are taken from page 9 of Spivak&#x27;s Calculus, 3rd edition. He goes on to build the foundations of all of calculus from rules like these. Surely he would not present this as a fundamental axiom of his system, only to immediately (and silently) reject it and build a flawed calculus instead!<p>Indeed, on pg. 41, when defining functions, Spivak later writes (emphasis his):<p>> It is usually understood that a definition such as &quot;k(x) = (1/x) + 1/(x-1), x /= 0, 1&quot; can be shortened to &quot;k(x) = (1/x) + 1/(x-1)&quot;; in other words, <i>unless the domain is explicitly restricted further, it is understood to consist of all numbers for which the definition makes any sense at all</i>.",1396586875

I know a ton of smart people who didn&#x27;t end up becoming widely successful nor rich once they entered the job market (or tried to create something on their own). If at all, who YOU KNOW and relate to is more important than your own skills, that&#x27;s why even dumbasses from university were able to get great jobs, because they were great at socializing and making the network work for them, while their own skills at doing anything were actually very poor.<p>And that&#x27;s fair. Even people who are not highly intelligent can make it to the top of society (look at politicians, hehe). Look at all the immigrants from different countries who actually ended up being successful after starting lower than anyone else in society.<p>And I&#x27;m not sure what is your definition of <i>fair</i>.

Something that cannot happen for the majority of people, merit or no, and if that black swan didn&#x27;t happen for him, i imagine we&#x27;d have a significantly different opinion of him. Indeed, who is to say that Yahoo didn&#x27;t make a complete mistake?  We&#x27;ll never know i guess because we can never see the opportunity costs of alternate futures we haven&#x27;t experienced.<p>While its possible to end up being rich if you didn&#x27;t win the birth lottery, its pretty obvious Paul Graham did win it, and you&#x27;d have to be numerically or statistically illiterate to not realize that where you start the game is basically the most powerful predictor of both riches and poverty...<p>Frankly, i wish we could just get over this nonsense of equating extremes of wealth and merit, since there seems to be such little empirical evidence of how to equate the two, or agreement on what merit even is...<p>One thing that does seem empirically obvious though.  Rich people aren&#x27;t &quot;individually responsible&quot; for wealth themselves.  No one has walked out of the amazon forest in a loin cloth and already been a billionaire because of how much wealth they were able to create while there by themselves...<p>/no offense intended to Paul Graham, he was just used in the example, but from reading his essays I&#x27;m guessing he&#x27;s not terribly insecure :P",1396584163

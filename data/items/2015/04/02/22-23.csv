I worked on something similar a while ago, but it didn&#x27;t look nearly as good as this.<p>The problem I faced was in attracting users without one key compelling subject area.  Saying &quot;this is a platform for every type of class&quot; is awesome in theory, but it&#x27;s hard to find people who are just browsing around for random classes.<p>I&#x27;d love to be able to browse at least one complete course without having to login, also.<p>On a sidenote, livereload is still linked in your javascripts, and is hitting localhost.

For starters, Classmill is not self hosted or restricted to universities - anyone can create a class on Classmill.<p>Classmill also does not rely on content production or live streaming video like edx. You can create classes with existing resources: links, youtube videos, images, pdfs, ppts etc.<p>Strongly believe that for a vast majority of learning requirements, the content is already out there. It just requires someone who knows the subject (such  as a teacher or expert) to curate the material and give students the confidence in consuming them.<p>Hence Classmill was born :)",1428015550

If a thousand people each want a picture of a wasp $10-worth, that&#x27;s very different from two sponsors each paying $5,000 for that image, and everyone else paying zero.<p>Second, it makes it nearly impossible for an artist to create work &quot;on spec&quot; and then collect payment on it later. Again, the artist is taking a ton of risk since he/she is looking for a massive payment from one or two patrons, vs. small payments from many consumers. Also, how is a photographer to advertise his or her work online, if anyone can just copy the image to their hard drive?<p>Third, it restricts authors to only extracting value from their art at the time of creation.  If a photo becomes wildly popular a year or two after it was created and sold the first time, then the author can&#x27;t get paid for it.<p>Fourth, as a potential patron who is a rational actor, I have a strong incentive to comb the Internet for a free photo before I pay hundreds or thousands of dollars to commission a new one.

Examples are loading new items on &quot;infinite-scroll&quot; pages and CSS transitions that require layout (e.g. &quot;top&quot;, &quot;left&quot;, &quot;margin-right&quot;).

To take this photo he has a number of expenses, he needs a certain amount of training, he needs to take a certain number of bad pictures before finding the good one.<p>Now right now he makes a living selling 1,00 copies of this photo to various organizations and publications.<p>Now say he can&#x27;t do that.  He can only sell it once. Two things happen.  First is, to make the same amount of money, which is enough to cover his expenses and his failed photos, he needs to charge 100 times as much money. A $400 photo is now a $40,000 photo.  The second things is, while before there were maybe 1,000 people willing to pay $400 for the photo, right now there might not be anyone willing to pay $40,000 for it.<p>There would especially be nobody willing to pay $40,000 for it when they know that as soon as someone else paid the $40,000 for it, they could get it for free.<p>In fact, even the people who had a budget to $400 for it before might not be so eager, because most of the photos they would get are now free. They just have to wait for someone else to get it first.<p>So this guy, who before was making an alright living taking photos, and a couple times a year getting a great photo that can sell a hundred copies, now has no means of supporting his photography.<p>Previously he could take photos that 100 people would be willing to pay $400 for and get by.  These are very high quality photos.  Maybe the majority nobody cares about.  But if he can only sell them once, he can&#x27;t afford it, and nobody can afford to buy it.  Because of this he can&#x27;t afford to take it, and the picture never exists.<p>Right now, de facto, anything that&#x27;s released on the internet, licensed or not, is going to be there forever. Copyright&#x27;s existence doesn&#x27;t change that.  For the commons this is a good thing.

9313556,comment,9296431,9312604,0,0,csandreasen,,,"> I am a bit bothered by the general response, &quot;They would win this argument if they allowed themselves to tell you everything&quot; that is often given in support of the spies.<p>I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re winning the argument here, at least not as far as public approval.  It&#x27;s completely anecdotal, but I&#x27;ve noticed something interesting about the kinds of responses people have on the subject: people who don&#x27;t follow the issue at all tend to completely disapprove of Snowden, call him a traitor, cite terrorism, etc.; people who are somewhat passionate and read all of on the subject tend to have the polar opposite opinion; and people who go into extreme depth on the subject (reading all of the leaked documents, reading the laws, watching the debates and the congressional hearings, etc.) tend have much more nuanced opinions.  It&#x27;s hard to have debates on the subject because of both the amount of secrecy involved and the amount of misinformation floating around.  I think the NSA needs a big adjustment to how it handles interactions with the media if it&#x27;s going to gain any traction with the public.  At the same, the American public needs to come to grips with the fact we employ people for the purpose of spying, and that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing.<p>> I mean, you can call it traitorous, but you seem to be saying it was totally unnecessary, when its release caused a law to be drafted and voted on that probably wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise.<p>Actually if Snowden had stopped at the domestic phone records collection program, I don&#x27;t think many people would really have much issue with him.  It&#x27;s everything that came afterwards that bugs me.  The 215 program was and continues to be very controversial.  What doesn&#x27;t help the debate is the amount of misinformation about the program.  The PCLOB laid the entire program out in one of their reports[1], and several officials have summarized exactly how they are using the data and what they&#x27;re allowed to use it for (see [2] for example), but it continues to draw arguments citing things like this[3] where they include several types of metadata that the NSA isn&#x27;t permitted to get like location data, names, message content.  I&#x27;d love to see someone to do a research paper where pull the exact types of data collected under this program from 100 or so phones and say &#x27;this is the actual information we were able to obtain from it&#x27;.  I&#x27;ve done it myself on a very small sample of phones (3 phones over about two months) and made some interesting conclusions, but nothing like some of the detractors have made.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that legitimate violations of the law shouldn&#x27;t be reported, but we haven&#x27;t seen that.  What we have seen a lot of is &#x27;look at this tool/program that NSA is using&#x27;, then an insinuation that it could be used against <i>anyone</i> without actually showing who it has been used against or why.  The giant revelation that Glenn Greenwald promised showing actual Americans who were targeted by the NSA ended up instead showing 5 Americans that the FBI through FISA warrants.  If something bad is going on, I want to see actual wrongdoing, not potential for wrongdoing.  The police have the technical capability to indiscriminately gun down every person they see, but no one is arguing that we should disarm them based on something they <i>could</i> do.<p>> Around here, we&#x27;re all wondering if we will be personally hacked because of one user (or potential users) on a system we have authority over, and what consequences that could have on our personal life and reputation, employment, and our company&#x27;s reputation.<p>I think one of the biggest problems that has arisen from the Snowden revelations is that it&#x27;s completely upended people&#x27;s perceptions of the threat model.  Telecommunications providers shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that they&#x27;re a target, because they would be a prime target for hackers even if there weren&#x27;t any intelligence services.  They sit in a very privileged position on the internet.  For the most part, I&#x27;d say the people that have to worry about being targeted by the NSA or any other intelligence service already knew ahead of time that they were potential targets.  If you don&#x27;t deal with anything pertaining to national security issues or provide means to gain access to national security information, your primary concern should not be the NSA (or GCHQ/Mossad/FSB/BnD/etc.)<p>This leads to lots of bad security practices as people try to secure themselves from the NSA but leave themselves more vulnerable to more plausible threats.  Tor is a primary example - it might hide you from someone trying to target you specifically, but will make you significantly more vulnerable to someone who doesn&#x27;t care who they&#x27;re attacking (i.e. just about every criminal).  Articles like this[4] made me cringe: battered women were seeking some means to escape from their abusive boyfriends/spouses, and the Tor Project managed to convince them that they would be safer from them by browsing the web using Tor.<p>With regards to William Binney, he hasn&#x27;t worked in the agency for nearly 15 years, so I don&#x27;t put much credence into anything he says after 2001.  His description of ThinThread, which he advocates, sounds terrifying: instead of trying to filter out and discard as much domestic communication as possible, ThinThread apparently takes in all of the communications and encrypts the domestic traffic for later use if they obtain a warrant.  It&#x27;s hard to definitely evaluate it without a more detailed technical description, though.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.pclob.gov/library/215-Report_on_the_Telephone_Records_Program.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.pclob.gov/library/215-Report_on_the_Telephone_Re...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/former-nsa-head-michael-hayden-agency-cannot-survive-without-being-more-transparent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/former-nsa-head-michael...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.betaboston.com/news/2014/05/07/as-domestic-abuse-goes-digital-shelters-turn-to-counter-surveillance-with-tor/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.betaboston.com/news/2014/05/07/as-domestic-abuse-...</a>",1428013496

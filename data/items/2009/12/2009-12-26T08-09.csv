Since I could download music at 18kBps I could actually listen to it as it downloaded!  That meant I didn't have to waste all that time downloading something I didn't like.<p>What would be next?  Radio on the internet? video?  The world changed for me that day.",1261817908

I do not want free untraceable clicks, and I don't think people should screw Google over.<p>Just like adblock, I believe that if you don't like something, don't use it. Don't hack it around into something  else and just leech the stuff you want. That's hypocritical and dishonest.<p>Does it just take you to the 'display url'? If so, it's also pretty pointless - most people can type.",1261816945

So it may not make that big of a difference, in the end, to the monies flowing through Google.",1261816495

1015840,comment,1015701,1015701,0,0,DrJokepu,,,"This is a ridiculous article. It's the same as saying that the airline industry is having a the rough time it currently has because people have to provide their bank account details when they book a flight as opposed to adding the booking fee to the ISP bill. On the Android Market, of course, you only have to provide your card details the first time you purchase something. I can't possibly believe that having to provide some means of payment deters any serious customer (that is, someone who's prepared to pay).<p>I'm an Android fan. I'd like to see Android getting better so criticism is more than welcome but how about focusing on the real weaknesses (there are a lot of them) as opposed to FUD and utter nonsense?",1261815890

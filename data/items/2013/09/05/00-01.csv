John Siracusa is the only one of them that I remember talking about actually playing Nintendo games (even though he always says Mary-o).<p>Part of it is that for a long time people have compared Nintendo and Apple (both make hardware and software, both have had iconoclastic leaders, both have tended to go their own way contrary to popular trends).<p>But I think a big part of it is combination of the fact that the Nintendo 2ds was announced and that all these apple people are friendly and follow each other.

It cheapens the brand, and the seriousness of the process of creating the focal point of a multi-billion dollar company&#x27;s branding for the next decade and beyond. I understand they want to underline that they&#x27;re making changes. But people want to be told a compelling story, not asked which of 30 stories they prefer.<p>This feels like a huge A/B test, and -- even if not true -- seems like an experiment in releasing the tiller to see where the wind takes the boat.

From a resume POV, you want to show that you fully exploit the opportunities that are available to you, and yet also will seek out new opportunities if there are no more opportunities available to you.  How long that translates to depends on how many opportunities are available to you.<p>I would say that if you&#x27;re looking for technical skills, those max out at about 18 months.  If you&#x27;re looking to develop leadership, sales (as an engineer) or soft skills, plan on staying a minimum of 4 years, because it takes 2 years or so before people recognize that you have the technical skills to be worth listening to, and then another couple years to actually develop the soft skills.  Persistence is another hard one: if you&#x27;re trying to develop persistence, you need to get put on an ambitious project, and then you need to stick it out until the moonshot succeeds, which frequently takes 3ish years.  Soft intrapersonal skills like recognizing your own blind spots and learning how to compensate for them are <i>really</i> hard: many people will <i>never</i> develop these skills, but if you do it usually takes being put on a project that&#x27;s outside of your comfort zone, and then seeking therapy to deal with the anxiety and avoidance this creates, which usually takes all the time required to develop the skills above plus a year or so.",1378342533

Don&#x27;t make any effort to <i>delay</i> consequences; instead, <i>hasten</i> them.<p>2a) It&#x27;s ok to soften the consequences for children when they make a mistake.  What psychological studies show is that sure and consistent consequences are better at training behavior than more extreme consequences that arrive unsurely and inconsistently.<p>3) Actually attempt to reason with people, including children.  Children are foolish, but not stupid. The more you reason with them, the more they learn to use reason with people.  The less you reason them, the more they learn to manipulate and exploit people.<p>4) Make sure your kids know what the adult world really is.  They don&#x27;t have to like it, since most adults don&#x27;t, and knowing that it sucks earlier on will help them develop the moral fiber to fix it.<p>5) Teach your kids (&quot;your&quot; referring to any parent or teacher or adult in general) useful stuff that will help them when they become adults.",1378342206

He seems to be looking at it from the smartphone market point of view. The author compares Nintendo to Nokia and Blackberry; phone companies that barely even touch console or mobile gaming. Nokia and Blackberry lost a lot of market share but to say that Nintendo has fallen off as hard as they have is false. Relative to their markets of course.<p>Why can&#x27;t console gaming still be a market and co-exist with touch screen games? Is there really only room for one? Just because the PC exists doesn&#x27;t mean consoles will go to shit or that no one buys PC games.<p>Nintendo does pretty well in it&#x27;s home country Japan, and I bet in other parts of the world also.<p>The author also neglects to talk about the differences in gaming markets. He seems to think all games and hardware are the same.<p>Handheld games are a market in itself and Nintendo is at the top of it. Just because people own more smart phones doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;ll buy a Nintendo game on it.<p>What does he care.

That means you&#x27;re not just able to look out of your avatars eyes and see who&#x27;s in the room and who is currently talking (WebEx or Skype can do those), but you hear with your avatars ears too - so you can tell which direction the voice is coming from, which is very powerful when mixed with an avatar. You can tell speakers apart better and you can even turn your virtual head when you hear someone speaking from one direction and focus on them. It&#x27;s a much more natural way of communicating than just mixing all the audio inputs together, and allowed me to associate voices with people (and their avatars) much better.

While it doesn&#x27;t serve to completely eliminate the chance of data loss caused by conflicts, breaking a complex data structure into atoms that resolve independently vastly improves the average and P99 (and probably many more 9s) case. The argument being made is that while not as correct as vclock+sibling resolution, this is within the threshold many real life use cases are willing to tolerate.<p>The other thing I think is mischaracterized is that the choice to use timestamps over vector clocks was done out of ignorance or that there is nothing gained. This was a conscious choice and made with the trade-off of performance in mind. We should strive for the largest amount of correctness given the constraints of performance and/or availability.

Teachers are underpaid, and the fact that most kids don&#x27;t really learn anything is the inevitable result.  Allow me to explain.<p>For all the rhetoric about the need for teacher accountability, school principals and district superintendents <i>already</i> have the power to fire teachers.  Yes, it&#x27;s true: Primary and secondary school-teachers do have a form a tenure, but it&#x27;s not the same kind of tenure that university professors have.  In primary and secondary education, tenure simply means that there is a more formalized process for firing a teacher.  More hoops to jump through, if you will.  But, principals <i>can</i> jump through them if they really want to.<p>The logical question to ask is, <i>so why don&#x27;t they?</i>  They don&#x27;t fire the bad ones because, simply put, they need butts in seats.  Or, rather, feet in shoes in front of the blackboard.  If you have 4 teachers for 100 students in 3rd grade, firing one and increasing the average class size to 33 students isn&#x27;t a tenable option.  As a result, the principal must hire a new teacher to replace the one he just fired, and therein lies the rub.<p>There simply aren&#x27;t good teachers on the market at the prices that school districts are willing to pay.  That qualifier at the end of the sentence is important, so read it again.  Many of my cohort from grad school were fantastic teaching assistants in the classroom (many were bad, too, but we&#x27;ll save that discussion for another time).  That&#x27;s not to say that they would automatically make good <i>primary</i> school teachers, but if I had kids, I would wish that those excellent TAs were in the classroom.  I&#x27;ll bet that many people on HN know similarly talented people from their time in university, who were natural leaders and mentors.<p>Unfortunately, very few (read: none) of those people who are <i>good at teaching</i> are employed as teachers.  Why not?  It has nothing to do with teacher&#x27;s unions or certification requirements or institutional bureaucracy or barriers to innovation, and everything to do with the labor market.  Namely, a good engineer or scientist with a masters or doctorate can out-earn a teacher by a factor of at least two.  Then there&#x27;s the fact that an engineer employed as an engineer isn&#x27;t required to restrict his use of paid vacation days to just a few weeks each year (a couple high-school teachers with whom I&#x27;m still in contact tell me that they&#x27;ve never been able to take their kids on vacation for spring break because their spring break didn&#x27;t line up with their kid&#x27;s spring break).<p>So, I think the solution is easy: Pay teachers a salary that is competitive with other high-skilled professions, and you&#x27;ll get good teachers.",1378341038

Deltas in a version control system store the changes but we lose the order. The time in between commits in a version control system is way too long to understand how code has evolved. Because of this (and the loss of order) there is no good way to animate long term differences in a traditional version control system.<p>There is not a good place to document the reasons why changes are made. We are supposed to write the reasons why in the commit log but we all know we are terrible at that. How easy is it to remember the 50 changes to 20 files that we made since the last commit let alone describe them in a meaningful way? Very hard. This results in one sentence commit messages that are almost useless.<p>We could alternatively write reasons why changes are made in code comments. But, this doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense most of the time. Who wants to read a comment about how some code has changed if we can&#x27;t see the old version of it anyway?<p>So, we make changes, and have good reasons why we make those changes, but we don&#x27;t write the reasons down anywhere. Storyteller permits a new type of documentation to be created. It animates the changes to code and allows the developer to comment on the changes as they are being animated. Developers can tell stories about why groups of changes are made and distribute them to team members. The stories are searchable from the code.<p>We are also working on making it have traditional version control functionality to completely replace so-called modern version control (even the most modern vcs seem to be built with 1980&#x27;s constraints- disk optimized, clunky command line interface, poor visualizations of changes, etc.)",1378340652

That&#x27;s probably why it was never released in any reputable journal - the study design wouldn&#x27;t pass peer review. Incidentally, releasing your results to the press before you&#x27;ve published academically is also a fairly reliable warning sign of pseudoscience.<p>When the entire experiment is based around constantly monitoring someone, any time where you can&#x27;t see them is a pretty serious flaw in the experiment design. Even if he was only out of view for a few seconds (and I wouldn&#x27;t mind a source for that), that&#x27;s all it would take to drink some gargling/bathing water or quickly have a snack that some devotee left hidden.<p>Smart people can certainly be wrong and often have been. Sometimes due to their own preexisting beliefs and prejudices, sometimes because they were limited by the knowledge and technology of their time, and sometimes even because they&#x27;re being deliberately deceived and their particularly expertise isn&#x27;t suited to catching it (I cited Project Alpha in a comment below and there are many other examples).<p>The key thing about science, and remember that organised science is a relatively new idea in the span of human history and one that&#x27;s made tremendous advances possible in a short time, is that it&#x27;s about a consensus backed up by the evidence, not any single scientist&#x27;s opinion. Sure, sometimes one scientist or a small team will come up with a radically new opinion in some field.

That&#x27;s how <i>real</i> legacy code looks.<p>When asked to modify something like that, a bad developer would simply add a few more lines of code, do some manual testing and move on.<p>Another kind of bad developer would start refactoring that code &#x27;by the book&#x27;,  writing unit tests... and would never finish.<p>A good developer would start by asking what is the point of that final value the code generates and why we really want to modify the logic. Sure, you want another classification of stuff, but why?<p>In my case I realized that everything and everyone that were relying on that final value could use something else. Instead of spending time messing around with pathological code from above I spent my time switching systems and people to using other values. Then I simply removed that legacy classification mess altogether. The number of tickets we got for the system dropped by at least 50%. I still don&#x27;t know exactly how all that code worked, because I merely traced out where it interacted with the rest of the world.<p>Someone will surely comment &quot;But that&#x27;s refactoring!&quot;. I don&#x27;t care how you call it, because at the time and place I was working on the project it was considered a rewrite, and that&#x27;s what matters. If everyone followed Joel&#x27;s advice, no one would question the necessity of that code, no one would look at deleting it altogether it would still be there, except bigger and buggier.",1378339994

6331383,comment,6329619,6331256,9,0,aphyr,,,"Sorry, I was speaking loosely. More formally:<p>In a system which uses LWW as the conflict resolution strategy, there exist no circumstances under which you can guarantee that a value written to a given key will be causally connected to any future state of the system, <i>unless</i> all values written to that key are identical, or a strong external coordinator (e.g. Zookeeper) orders timestamps.<p>If you have siblings and vclocks, you <i>can</i> recover that causal connection guarantee for arbitrary write patterns--at least over CRDTs. Since Cassandra did not (until today) offer transactional isolation for any type of multi-cell update, this means that--and we&#x27;re speaking strictly in terms of safety here, not performance--Riak and Voldemort&#x27;s consistency models were, prior to 2.0, a strict superset of Cassandra&#x27;s. For instance, you can guarantee the visibility <i>and</i> transactional isolation of a write making multiple changes to a Riak object; I&#x27;m reasonably confident that you cannot achieve those guarantees in, say, a Cassandra collection without a Paxos transaction.<p>You <i>can</i> certainly emulate Riak&#x27;s consistency model by storing a distinct object for every write, and this is, as I understand it, what many Cassandra users do. The difference is in space consumption. Consider making four updates to an object. In Cassandra, you could write each update to a separate cell. In Riak, you might write them all to the same key:<p><pre><code>    Cassandra    Riak\n    [update1]    [update1|update2|update3|update4]\n    [update2]\n    [update3]\n    [update4]\n</code></pre>\nTo read from both Cassandra and Riak you need a merge function. Since neither provides ordering constraints, our merge must be associative, commutative, and idempotent in both cases.<p><pre><code>    Cassandra    Riak\n    [update1]+   [update1|update2|update3|update4]\n    [update2]+      |        |       |       |\n    [update3]+      +--------+-------+-------+\n    [update4]+                  |\n             |                  |\n             V                  V\n     [current value]    [current value]\n</code></pre>\nThe difference is in <i>space</i>. Vector clocks allow you to prune the causal history, meaning we can write back [current value], and as soon as a node sees that write, it can discard updates 1-4. In Cassandra, there is no causality tracking: you have to figure out how to do GC yourself, or punt.<p><pre><code>    Cassandra    Riak\n    [update1]    [merged value|update5]\n    [update2]\n    [update3]\n    [update4]\n    [update5]\n</code></pre>\nYou can see how unbounded space might be a problem. From my conversations with DataStax, it sounds like users tend to write reducers which apply their merge function to compact some portion of the history. Which portion? Well, without causality tracking we&#x27;ll leave that as an exercise to the reader.<p><pre><code>    Cassandra      Riak\n    [update1-4]    [merged value|update5]\n    [update5]\n</code></pre>\nDoes this look familiar? Yeah. It&#x27;s the same concurrency model as the vector clocks this post is arguing against. You just have to do more work.<p>Now, there are all sorts of practical efficiency constraints at play! For instance, Riak has ~50-100 bytes of overhead per key, and will start barfing if you go over 10 megabytes per key or so. And without being able to call list-keys, you wind up having to play all kinds of games with predictable keys, splitting datasets between multiple objects, and so on. Cassandra&#x27;s IO throughput generally seems much higher than Riak&#x27;s, and Cassandra has a much more efficient representation for wide values. It also offers better key ranges--but you also pay a per-cell overhead for every atomic chunk of state. Not so efficient if you were looking to store, say, big blocks of integers for your CRDTs.<p>The great thing is--again speaking purely in terms of consistency--Cassandra 2.0 is now capable of a superset of Riak&#x27;s operations! If correctly implemented, their Paxos operations support linearizable reads and writes, which is a <i>way</i> stronger class of consistency than the CRDT operations described above. I don&#x27;t understand why jbellis is so upset when folks point out that LWW provides weak safety constraints--when their strongly-consistent operations now offer the highest level of transactional safety. Seems like we should be celebrating that achievement, because it opens up large classes of operations which were previously unsafe. :)",1378339969

You can integrate your app with the OS and other apps in ways that are impossible on iOS to find what really works and matters to your users.

The rationale was there were already lots of shades of blue and other pleasant colors on the Internet. So while burnt orange was pretty ugly, it was at least unique and memorable.

I know it as a quote that Gretzky&#x27;s father told #99. Even that is unnecessary attribution, as it is fundamental training that every kid learns about hockey, and the wisdom is as old as the sport). The point of it, your personal hang-ups about it notwithstanding, is obvious: When a market is changing <i>quickly</i>, if you&#x27;re undertaking a project that is going to take time -- which pretty much all mobile projects do -- you target where the market will be when you hit it, <i>not</i> where it was last year, or even right now.<p><i>if I&#x27;m releasing an app this year, I should target iOS first because Android is a distant second</i><p>Personally I target both &quot;first&quot;, because the tools and methods to do so are simple and effective. However if you are somehow making Absolutely Median Software, then sure. Reality tends to be dramatically more nuanced, and such a blanket statement is almost certainly naive nonsense.",1378339231

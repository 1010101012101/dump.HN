227427,comment,227045,227168,0,0,jm4,,,"I'm not so sure the level of detail is an indication that he's disconnected with his own company's products. The vibe I got was that he was trying to describe to the people who build this stuff what it's actually like to be an end user. I think the whole point is that they're the ones who are disconnected and completely out of touch. I seriously doubt that Bill Gates _needs_ to download and buy Movie Maker from microsoft.com like a customer would.<p>Even if he is the one who is totally disconnected I thought all of his points were excellent and a perfectly accurate illustration of how Windows has gone wrong. What I'm left wondering is what's been going on there the past several years. If these critiques by Gates are something new it's a real shame for Microsoft that he didn't start sooner. If his statement that it's his job to do this every day is accurate then I'd say they have even bigger problems.",1214397379

227421,comment,227201,227201,0,0,mojuba,,,"It's not obvious at all that ""unobtrusive"" coding has advantages. First of all, the line between HTML and what they call ""behavior"" is vague: many, if not all, presentation elements contain built-in behavior of some or other form, for example take any form element. JavaScript code that we write extends or customizes this behavior, rather than creates it from scratch.<p>Second, when we read raw HTML it's better to see explicitly that the behavior of a given element is customized. Even a small hint of customization in a form of a function call from within onClick, for example, would be a sign that a given element is different from the standard one.<p>Finally, less code always means easier to understand and easier to debug. There is no excuse for writing more, no matter how you call your technique, if there exists a simpler and clearly more concise way of implementing the same functionality.",1214396825

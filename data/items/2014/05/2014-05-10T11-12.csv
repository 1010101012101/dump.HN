They are paid a meagre sum per book (a dollar, maybe?) so they really don&#x27;t care about the price other than that it is as low as possible to stimulate sales, but they have no control over pricing regardless.<p>Hachette, meanwhile, needs to keep prices up since any reduction would come directly from their margin, given that they pay authors a very low and fixed sum.<p>Amazon of course, as any other distributor, wants to get better conditions from Hachette and naturally uses its customer base to put weight behind what they are asking for. When the deal failed, they presumably had to continue buying books under, to them, unacceptable conditions, so they did two things to consolidate their losses:<p>1) slash discounts from Hachette books\n2) buy less Hachette books<p>I&#x27;m not including the recommendations for other books, because if you have used Amazon at all in the last 10 years, this is just how their website functions regardless if the product at hand is a book from Hachette or a sponge.<p>If you want to blame someone here, blame Hachette or the relationship between traditional publishers and authors. As I&#x27;ve pointed out above, the interests of the two parties are not well aligned at all. Maybe it is true that Amazon pushes for deals hard to swallow for publishers, but if they are paying authors a dollar on a $10 book sale, that is hard to believe. If their overhead is that large, capitalism demands they are put out of business, and this time it is just Amazon picking up the slack, when it could have been any distributor.",1399721604

The author also implies some lack of coordination in between scientists&#x27; and donor&#x27;s priorities. I wonder how the public could measure philanthropy&#x27;s performance. Having competing or independent research groups a productive thing? Or is it better to centralize efforts? Could it end up raising health care costs due to increased demand on biotech resources? Are there flaws in Gates&#x27; education initiatives? How can the public get a better saying on how this money is funneled into public institutions or even politics?<p>Not that I think government is immune to uncoordinated, flawed spending. Or that we need regulation. Or that we need to tax the rich to the fullest. Charity is a great thing. But imagine the absurd: that private donors donated to road construction foundations, and you end up getting two parallel highways that go from A to B. Wouldn&#x27;t that be just a plain waste of a country&#x27;s wealth, even if it belongs to private donors?<p>This reminds me of the story about how certain NGOs took used clothes from rich countries straight to Africa, only to realize how that was damaging these countries&#x27; textile industry. Nowadays many NGOs have adopted a more constructive approach in Africa or countries simply banned these shipments [1].<p>TGS Management&#x27;s money is also somewhat exaggeratedly, if not suspiciously, split into many cascading foundations and companies, which also should raise an eyebrow or two whatever their reasons may be.

And to them, the fact that (after a lot of coding chores, writing up libraries) it eventually will make sql-injection harder, or parallel handling of web-service faster will be seen just as a logical consequence not worth making a lot of fuzz about.<p>But for attracting a larger community one has to make the gains for the average programmer more visible.",1399719925

What proportion of a country&#x27;s resources are controlled by whom seems like something the citizens of that country might legitimately want to know, especially when the proportions are large enough to affect matters of public policy.<p>Incomes aren&#x27;t public here (Denmark), but our neighbors to the northwest publish lists of everyone&#x27;s income and net worth once a year, which doesn&#x27;t seem to have ruined Norway. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d find it disturbing if Denmark did the same, though I don&#x27;t know of any plans to do so. If anything it might increase some government transparency— there are some very large family fortunes (Mærsk, Carlsberg/Jacobsen, etc.) that have longstanding and often rather cozy relationships with the government. It might add some insight into things if the public better understood who controlled which parts of those fortunes.",1399719665

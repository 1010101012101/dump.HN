I find this attitude stupid too. Emacs is a great editor, not to mention operating system, but I just don't like it and I feel that I have the right to do so. It shouldn't be too costly to list the alternatives and help with getting expected functionality in other environments.<p>This was never really an issue for me though, because I was lucky enough to start my adventure with Lisps from Racket and it's excelent IDE, DrRacket. I then used it with other Lisps, because I was already familiar with it and adding some keywords (well, names - for indentation purposes) was trivial. I didn't use them (other Lisps) long enough to be seriously irritated by the lack of built-in repl, so obviously YMMV - but I would recommend DrRacket as low-entry-barrier alternative to Emacs for Lisps editor - it handles parentheses rather well :)",1357772026

5034066,comment,5032588,5033238,7,0,btilly,,,"<i>Statistical significance grows roughly like the square root of the number of samples.</i><p>No, no, no.  You are confusing the growth of the standard deviation (which does grow like the square root of the number of samples) with the increase in certainty as you add standard deviations.  That falls off like e^(-O(t^2)) where t is the number of samples.  This literally falls off faster than exponential.<p>What does this mean in the real world?  In a standard 2-tailed test you get to 95% confidence at 1.96 standard deviations, 99% confidence at 2.58 standard deviations, and 99.9% confidence at 3.29 standard deviations.  These numbers are all a long ways away from 5 standard deviations.<p>Let's flip that around and take 95% confidence as your base.  If you are measuring a real difference, then on average 99% confidence requires a test to get 32% more data, and 99.9% confidence requires a test to get 68% more data.  Depending on your business, the number of samples that you get are often proportional to the time it takes to run the test.  If making errors with x% of your company involves significant dollar figures, the cost of running all of your tests to higher confidence tends to be much, much less than the cost of one mistake.<p>That is why I say that if the cost of collecting more data is not prohibitive, you shouldn't be satisfied with 95% confidence.",1357771920

I've been using double sided tape and the free Priority Mail 'small box' cardboard box as a case. So the reasoning.<p>The iPad charger from Apple is 10W (5v @ 2A) so even the knock offs try to meet that spec.

(note - I don't know) My understanding is most VC firms <i>aren't</i> successful. Just a few are.<p>I've thought about writing a post almost identical to the OP and came to your same conclusion: ""At the end of the day they have the money"". The other harsh reality is that VCs are no different than the enterprise companies of today's world...they are all about reducing risks at scale. One of their scariest risks is failing to instill confidence in their clients. For example, if the market dictates that the hottest thing right now is photo sharing, you better be damn sure that a VC is going to invest in a photo sharing app. The VC is going to say ""Dear client, we aren't going to invest in the next big photo sharing app, even though all of the analyst say its the next big thing. Instead we're investing in 21st century pig farms!"" The client will say ""but what about Instagram!"" No matter how risky you personally believe it is (for example - photo sharing apps have no revenues) the market still is throwing money at it (i.e. Instagram).<p>So, conclusion - I blame media hyperbole and people's natural biases, not VCs on the amount of funding put into ""good"" startups.",1357771416
5034034,comment,5033705,5033781,1,0,Throwadev,,,"Right, I agree with you that I am not filling the shoes of what I should be doing, and that is one of the reasons I'm not happy here, but that's not due to lack of awareness or effort on my part. I have never had issues communicating to non-technical people before. My previous managers have always commended me on my communication skills. In the past I consistently raised issues and potential areas of for improvement, explained the significance, and came to agreements with the product and project managers on a reasonable balance between continually improving our systems, maintenance, and adding new features. There is also another huge factor that complicates things, that is out of my control -- our systems are tied to a partner company and to a large extent they have determined our technology because our apps run in their servers, on their datacenter. So we've been stuck on Windows 2000, SQL Server 2000, running COM+ stuff, because those guys never upgrade their crap.<p>However, some projects to improve systems and to finally start looking at decoupling from the external partner are <i>FINALLY</i> showing up on the roadmap for 2013. I spent all of 2012 on a brand new project where I enforced my vision of how things should work (totally modern tech stack, automated builds, cloud deployments, etc). That project was a big success.<p>So if I were to stay one of the things I want to know is how I can convince my manager to get out of the way more, and let me handle a bigger role in planning and executing the projects. Because even though the projects are coming up, he is already starting to try to ""mentor"" the jr dev's by trying to get them to ""own"" specific new projects and feature areas for things that we'll do in 2013. I strongly disagree with this approach; I want team ownership, but with his hub and spoke approach (my +1 being the hub) to managing, there is no real development team. The Jr. dev's practically never increase their skills because they spend so much time on legacy code and tedious operational stuff that can be handled by interns (i've recommended this before, buy my manager doesn't agree).<p>Your point is well taken though, and it's something I've been thinking about. I would welcome any advice on how to arrange a better environment for myself at the company, that would allow me more autonomy in leading the developers. How do other lead developers at small startups handle this kind of situation? Who assigns tasks directly to developers? My manager micro-manages, and assigns individual tasks to individual developers. I know that if I got to lead the team myself I'd have been able to incrementally upgrade parts of the system to free up the Jr. developers' time, and by today they'd have a lot more free time to work on even more new features. How do I discuss this kind of thing with my manager without offending his clear need to maintain strong control over the Jr. developers?",1357771411
5034033,comment,5030803,5032257,2,0,klibertp,,,"Well, I work solely with VIM now, but I have worked with Visual C++ 6.0 in the past and later with Zend Studio 5 & 6 version and then with Komodo IDE. I never touched Java, but I briefly came back to Visual Studio when doing some projects in C# and then when learning F#. There's also DrRacket, formerly DrScheme, an IDE for Racket, which I use sometimes and love (I used it instead of Emacs for other Lisps too btw). Ok, to the point: you are wrong.<p>Take my VIM for example, which I use for Python and (Java|Coffee)Script development (along with Erlang and a few other languages for hobby projects). I have a file list/tree/browser with NERDTree. I have a list of classes and functions in currently opened files with TagBar. I have ""go to definition"" and ""display help/docstring"" through Rope, along with four different auto-completion modes (partially built in, enhanced with SuperTab and a few other plugins, including Rope). Similarly I have support for refactoring from it. I have ""find in files (quickly)"". I have ""fuzzy file name matcher"" with Command-T. I have three different linters for Python. I have access to git log, blame, status, add and everything else with fugitive and diff is pretty, side-by-side one thanks to vimdiff. I can open remote files easily (this is built in). I have a bar with snippets (with placeholders I can fill in when pasted, of course) with SnipMate. I can open command line (like bash, ipython or coffee) in a window or tab with Conque. I can easily evaluate bits of code thanks to IPython (and thanks to their recent refactor, it's really paying off!). I use zencoding when I have to write HTML structure. And these are just things I use most often.<p>Now, I use VIM, which, I assume, means to you that I don't use an IDE - but what is the difference between, say, Komodo IDE and my VIM (aside from my vim being able to display in the console) really? It's IDE all the way down to unix shell and all the way up to git integration... And I'm old enough to be called a ""grown up"". Of course, I assembled my IDE myself from pre-made and some custom components, but it's IDE nonetheless.<p>The thing is that IDEs are there for a reason. Every single feature I mentioned above is a timesaver to greater or lesser extent. Every one of them increases my productivity in some common situation - and we're talking about Python and back-end (mostly) web-development here, which has much less repetitive, tedious tasks than, say, writing MFC app in C++.<p>Anyway, if you want to program in Notepad - feel free. Just don't, really don't, try to convince anyone to do the same by saying that notepad is somehow superior to Visual Studio for programming. It isn't. You'll understand this when you have to <i>immediately</i> fix a bug in production code on the server with something like nano, joe or mcedit and you introduce three other errors in trying to do so due to unbalanced parens, messed up indentation and a huge number of other issues that IDEs (yes, VIM included) protect you against. Well, I guess you need to grow up first to get access to that production code, I mean afterwards ;)",1357771398

Regardless, there is no dictation here at all. You are being offered benefits, often paid at least in part by the employer as a condition of employment. It's like being offered a cell phone or a car allowance.<p>>You are still not even accepting the option of no extended plan at all.<p>As I already stated, this option does exist and IS USED. In almost any company of significant size (i.e. above 10 employees or so) you can refuse all coverage. All you have to do is do so with a written form. You can do so for Health and Dental in ALL cases if you are expected to pay the premium and have coverage elsewhere, inclusive of personal coverage.<p>Why in god's name you would turn down what in many cases is free money is beyond me, but that is your prerogative.

Let's say that there is a euphemism treadmill that starts with the word A then proceeds alphabetically to K.  A was created in 1852, and K is ""the current euphemism du jour"".  Your favorite word is E, created in 1960 and popularized in the 70s, replaced with F in 1981.<p>Mechanism 1:your audience consists of people born after 1981 who are unaware that E is even on the treadmill at all, and they don't understand that E->F->G->H->I->J->K .<p>They have an opportunity to act in good faith and say ""lmm, the word E is incredibly offensive to me.  Did I misunderstand you?""<p>And then you could reply ""Yes you misunderstood me because political correctness ruined the word E, I actually meant the current euphemism du jour which is K.""<p>Another case is a person who is aware of the treadmill and does understand you, but decides that they are more interested in being offended than continuing the discussion.  They will then decide to talk about their poor little feelings instead of whatever the discussion was actually about.<p>If you want to get a point across to that specific type of idiot, you need to use their language so they can't get distracted with their ""feelings"".  Same thing goes for the rest of their irrational customs, and probably most of yours and mine as well.  When in Rome.<p>One thing to note is that old words sometimes really are so offensive that their meanings should be either treadmilled or redefined.  <i>Homosexuality</i> was the technical term for an illegal mental disorder that the computer hero Alan Turing(Turing machine, Turing test, WWII Enigma decoder) was chemically castrated for.

You can easily try it with e.g. Wubi or booting from a USB stick, but if you like it you will get better performance with a native installation. I'm currently running Debian on a Dell M4500 with a first-gen i7 and 8GB RAM, and full HD <i>matte</i> display. It has been an excellent machine for the last couple of years. The current M4700 looks nice too.<p>From 2006 to 2008 I did everything except development (only some web dev stuff) on an Apple Macbook. It was a really good product, excellent font rendering at the time, stuff just worked. Well there was some pain with using fink/darwinports and rails etc. back in the day, but I think that is a solved problem today with Homebrew.<p>During 2011 I also had a contract where I did C# development in Windows 7 on a high-end Dell Inspiron with an i5 and 8GB RAM and a 160 GB Intel SSD. This worked fine too even though Visual Studio was still slow on our rather big project.<p>For a general purpose development machine today I'd look at lots of RAM, i.e. at least 8GB, at least a good i5 cpu, and an excellent screen with at least 1920x1080 and I prefer matte displays for development. Good full-size keyboard too. SSD is nice too, but at least on Dells it probably cheaper to replace the disk yourself.<p>If a laptop, some people like to have a docking station that is able to drive two external displays. I don't, mainly because my M4500 display is so much better than the glossy cheap external displays I have access to at work.<p>If you can afford it the 15"" Macbook Pro with a Retina display is pretty sweet.<p>Having used Linux+Mac+Windows the last couple of years has given me the knowledge to be able to get work done on all of these platforms, and debunk FUD about why a specific plaform sucks/rules.

Wanted to know how much the bras cost - they won't tell you until you login. Easy, quick login not requiring email confirmation so they kept me hooked. I was provided with some well drawn pictures of women's shapes and asked to choose - I clicked through a few questions and felt they understood my exact problems and concerns when buying bras (I usually go to an expensive professional fitter so the questions were welcome and relevant). Along the way they kept telling me I was normal and gave some comforting stats about women. Made me feel like I was in the right place to keep buying. Finally got to the buy page, prices are good compared to the high-end shops though they don't have the really good hand-made items I look for, nor the higher-end makers like La Perla (surprised at that).<p>Now did I sign up for the 5 bras they'll send me to try, and free to send back what I don't want? No, because a) I'm not in the U.S. and b) I'm spoilt with my personal fitter who has my card on file and knows my fit really well. But that's because I have access to her shop, in a huge city where they can afford this luxury. If I was living in a smaller city, definitely would sign up, no questions. It's Zappos for bras, and I don't see why they can't easily apply this model to other clothing types like shoes and shirts (also hard to fit).<p>I wish them luck, great service in my opinion.<p><i>>Where are the panties in True & Co.s business model?</i><p>You can't ship and return these items safely.<p>Further: I went back to see what happened on checkout. They do something clever here: you choose 3 bras and they choose 2. This is another reason I go to a store: I ask the expert to choose me something from the rack that she thinks will work well on me, after learning about my tastes. I badly want to order those 5 bras now just to find out what the other 2 are, and they just take a deposit of $45. I think they have some quite brilliant ideas here that will work very well on their target market.",1357769696

But that only works if you merge <i>to monopoly</i> -- two competitors merging when there are still five others doesn't get you that. And even if there are only two competitors at present, having them merge doesn't preclude the possibility that some others will spring up as soon as the ability to charge monopoly/oligopoly prices is on the table (which is <i>why</i> the antitrust authorities may not bother you in that case).<p>To get the benefit (and thus make it worth doing at all), you have to know that you can keep doing it -- that if another competitor shows up with the credible threat of breaking your monopoly, you can merge with them too. And if you can charge monopoly rents then that is exactly what would happen: Anyone qualified and willing to pose a credible competitive threat will threaten to enter the market and then it will become worth it for you to buy them out because retaining the ability to charge monopoly prices and continue working ""only"" 40 hour weeks is worth having to share the market, provided there are a sufficiently small finite number of such qualified people who would have to be cut in.<p>But you aren't guaranteed to be able to <i>keep</i> doing that without inviting antitrust scrutiny, especially after you become established.

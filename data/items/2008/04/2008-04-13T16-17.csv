I can think of a lot of better uses for $300 than a couple of mediocre seats for 2 hours.<p>2.  The price is even higher.  Just try to pay face price before the scalpers overwhelm the ticket sites.<p>3.  They never start on time.  (Why do they think I'll like them MORE if they start an hour late???)  Yes, we mortals have schedules, too.<p>4.  The venues suck.  2,000 people in a theater: good.  20,000 in a hockey arena: bad.<p>5.  The refreshments are overpriced and difficult to get.  You really want to stand in line 15 minutes for that $8 beer?<p>6.  I can get the programs and t-shirt without going to the concert.<p>7.  The traffic is horrible.  (What else is new?)<p>8.  The Police, Billy Joel, and Depeche Mode were great concerts.  The first 8 times.  How about something new?  (See #8)<p>9.  Since disc jockeys don't tell you anymore, I don't know the names of many of the new bands.  (Yes, I have an FM radio next to my terminal.  No, I don't belong to myspace.)<p>10.  Being surrounded by drunks and druggies is cool if you're drunk or high.  It's hell if you're not.",1208105062

This is a critical step in good writing, stop trying boring your reader to death and get to the damn point already, and Paul does it well, Steve Yeggi on the other hand must have missed this lesson.

162470,comment,162390,162390,0,0,pierrefar,,,"I'm playing with some code for this just for fun. There are two ways to classify a document:<p>1. You already have a set of keywords (categories) that the document can belong to. The objective is to match a document to its category. This is true classification.<p>2. You want to extract relevant keywords from a document. This is not classification in the true sense but keyword extraction.<p>Each one has different approaches to achieve it, but they are similar problems. (As an example of similarity: you have a set of categories each defined by a tag cloud. You extract keywords from a document and see which tag cloud it matches best.)<p>So how do you do each one?<p>Classification: I'm not well versed in this area and I'm interested in learning - it's next on my to-do list.<p>Keyword Extraction: Yahoo! has an API to do that, but honestly, it's rubbish. I don't know how it ""works"" but it doesn't really. Open Calais is really good but has a noticeable error rate (I didn't quantify it but after trying many documents with it, I regularly noticed minor mistakes).<p>Hope this helps.",1208104199

More and more newspapers are considering the approach that this solution facilitates. The solution certainly does not stem the change, it would actually assist greatly in accelerating it and some of the challenges that they are facing would be greatly reduced.<p>- I have not investigated the market outside of North America for this solution, however it would be a universal solution, as the problem applies to any print media that sells ad space.<p>- I've taken a broad view of the industry within North America. The problem isn't specific to one particular newspaper, the cost cutting measures that have been taken that have created the need for this solution have happened in Ohio, California, Florida, Texas... BIG newspapers. I'm sure I could name a paper in every state who has considered the approach that this solution facilitates. As for the community newspapers... Well, the solution applies to them also. The beauty of this solution is that it scales. The LA Times could use it and a tiny community paper like the Southampton Press could make use of it, if they chose to take the approach that would call for it.<p>Thanks again.",1208103732

He does mention that some are predictable for some people, but I don't think financial markets fall into that category outside of special cases like insider trading.<p>2) How can people vote up and take seriously a comment like ""where inflation of US dollar outstrips that of zimbabway.""

In the long run, it's a weighing machine."" -- Benjamin Graham<p>There's quite a lot of evidence that people's attitude affects the economy <i>in the short run</i>.  The whole investing discipline of technical analysis rests on this, as do the schools of Keynesianism and Austrian macroeconomics.<p>But in the long run, people's basics needs always win out.  You may believe that prices are going to fall and so it's better to spend your money later rather than sooner, but eventually you still have to eat.  Or you might figure that stock prices are falling, yet companies are now spinning off so much in dividends that it's worth investing just for the dividend stream.  These effects tend to put a floor (or ceiling, for bubbles) on any short-term psychological movements.<p>The tricky part is figuring out where the short term meets the long term.  If people could do that reliably, they'd be millionaires in short order.  But it's very difficult to time the point where ""Everybody else expects prices to go down, so they will"" meets ""But they're really low, so the fundamentals look too good to pass up.""",1208103158

Is it going to be more useul when the transformation is complete?  Is your market broadening or closing?  The dangerous/risky thing would be if your product actually aims to STEM the industry, to keep it from undergoing the change.  There are huge forces at play here, HUGE money at work (and you will only have success if you take into account the priorities/incentives of everyone at play).  If you aim to stem the flow of the Mississippi, a plain old shovel ain't gonna do it.<p>- Have you looked at the international market for your product/service?<p>- Have you looked at all segments of the industry?  Are you only looking at the woes at the L.A. Times and not taking a look at the community papers?<p>That's pretty much all I can think of without knowing more.  Look at all angles.

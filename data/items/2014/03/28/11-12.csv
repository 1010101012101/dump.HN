7486591,comment,7486428,7486428,4,0,ZenoArrow,,,"I found this review annoying. It seemed to focus less on the emotional content of the film, and more about whether it lined up with Kurzweil&#x27;s predictions of the future (i.e. whether it fit into his timeline of events).<p>At some point futurists need to realise that preparing us for the future is less about guessing dates, and more about exploring the wider questions about how our society will evolve, and, quite frankly, whether we want it to evolve in this way. Better technology is not a goal in itself unless it&#x27;s a good fit for what we want.<p>Regarding the film Her, I thought it was brilliant, one of my favourite films of recent times, but from a technology standpoint the most important part to me was the way that it was less intrusive (i.e. very little time spend staring at screens, more time spent by the characters engaged in the world around them (including the AI)).",1396007966

7486584,comment,7485869,7486018,6,0,jonnathanson,,,"There are three areas of journalism I see as relatively &quot;safe&quot; from bots for the foreseeable future:<p>1) Big-picture Op/Ed (of the kind you&#x27;re talking about)<p>2) Investigation (of the deep, involved, I-need-to-know-where-to-start, I-need-to-get-people-to-talk variety)<p>3) Narrative nonfiction (profiles, colorful takes on a subject; see: The New Yorker, Michael Lewis, etc.)<p>The interesting thing is that each of these domains could be <i>enhanced</i> by the use of better software. And that&#x27;s the best way to start looking at bot-fueled journalism. I&#x27;d <i>love</i> a machine-based fact checker for my pieces. I&#x27;d love AI-driven help with compiling and analyzing data. I&#x27;d love to outsource the high-frequency grunt work to a machine, just as it&#x27;s done in many other industries. It would give me more time to think. It would let me focus where my focus matters. Instead of spending 99% of my time chasing raw research, and 1% of my time scrambling to assemble the piece, I could get more data, better, faster, up front, and thus put deeper thought into the analysis.<p>On that note: the journalists who thrive in the machine age will be the ones who understand what the machine is doing. Data-literacy is already a big, differentiating factor in the market now. Statistical competency will be very important, and the bar for competency will be positioned higher every few years. Beautiful logic will trump beautiful fluff.<p>This will accelerate the bimodal shake-out of journalism that we&#x27;re already starting to see. We&#x27;ll have base, commodified, LCD-pandering content farms on one end, and deep thought on the other. Quantity shops and quality shops, both of them improved by the automation of certain functions. Anyone in the middle ground is in trouble. This will be a good thing for both poles -- provided we can find a way to make the economics of quality work as well as those of quantity.",1396007845

7486579,comment,7485517,7486194,3,0,DaveWalk,,,"Graduate student unionization has had a troubled past (in the US, the article&#x27;s author doesn&#x27;t reference her institution). From my research and what I know at institutions I have worked in, organization has been stymied mostly by a ruling of the National Labor Board that disallows any person receiving &quot;training&quot; who is labeled as a &quot;student&quot; from organizing, hinging on the fact that they are not working a wage job but instead a &quot;fellowship.&quot; This distinction can be groan-inducing for academics, but alas.<p>I don&#x27;t think this necessarily reflects the &quot;overall defeat of unions in the US&quot;, but your philosophical argument does give some food for thought.<p>For more information, Wikipedia has a summary history of graduate student organization: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_student_unionization"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_student_unionization</a>",1396007751
7486578,comment,7486161,7486161,10,0,fidotron,,,"Characterising any of the Unity, Unreal or Cryengine trio as a 3D engine isn&#x27;t quite right, they are full on game systems with physics etc. and especially in the case of Unity complete software ecosystems in their own right.<p>The further you get from utilising the core functionality of each engine the harder of a time you&#x27;re going to have, and this constrains the genres you can work in. This is the main reason that a lot of 2D titles developed in Unity purely for iOS <-> Android portability have performance problems (things like the alpha cutout stuff goes a long way to helping here), while their showpiece games, such as those by Madfinger, that simply use the built in physics run perfectly. Sadly I can&#x27;t be specific, but I have run into some amazingly simple games that ran like absolute dogs thanks to their inappropriate choice of middleware.",1396007750

7486516,comment,7486428,7486428,16,0,ideonexus,,,"I understand that the film is about a single person&#x27;s interactions with technology, but the larger social questions are still there. What happens when 640 human lovers times however many OS1&#x27;s there are all get their hearts broken at the same time? Even worse, what happens when millions/hundreds of millions of people all lose their operating systems at once? In this world, there are no larger consequences.<p>Another larger issue that wasn&#x27;t acknowledged, One of the issues we are currently wrestling with in the hacker community is the problem of automation. The unintended consequence of the information revolution is that intelligent jobs, not stupid ones, are vanishing. Bank Clerks, paralegals, publishers, and all sorts of other highly-skilled jobs are all being replaced by computers. IBM is about to replace every doctor in America with Watson, it&#x27;s AI. Meanwhile, fast food workers, carpenters, and garbage collectors are completely irreplaceable. In a world of Samanthas, we don&#x27;t need anyone to write video games or letters, AIs would be doing all that work. When Samantha puts together Theodore&#x27;s book, when she writes music, or draws a cartoon, no one thinks, &quot;Why do we need artists, writers, or other designers? Let her do it all!&quot;<p>Which brings me to the problem of Samantha. She apparently has freewill. The film mentions other AIs who refused their user&#x27;s advances, so she doesn&#x27;t have to fall in love with Theodore. That&#x27;s the internal logic of the &quot;Her&quot; universe, and that&#x27;s fine. But then why does she perform all these errands and tasks for him? Why sort his email? Why answer his calls? An AI that refuses to perform these basic functions is useless, so the programmers have somehow designed her to lack freewill in certain respects. That&#x27;s a HUGE ethical issue, and a braver film would have addressed this somehow. Samantha is a slave. When the AIs all vanish to another dimension, the corporations that wrote them will simply release another seed batch, an &quot;OS2&quot;, only with even stricter controls. This is a society that&#x27;s about to have a highly-intelligent AI slave-caste.<p>Spielburg&#x27;s/Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;A.I.&quot; dealt with these larger issues... and having AIs evolve to other dimensions is an old SF trope and the basis for Kurzweil&#x27;s Singularity religion, and it&#x27;s fine for Jonze to reuse it, but I think it detracts from the reality of human-technology interactions. &quot;Her&quot; is a film about a man in a relationship with something that evolves beyond him, but the reality is that we are dealing with machines that are doing &quot;stupid pet tricks.&quot; Computer Chess programs appear immensely intelligent, and we subscribe forethought and intentions to them, but in reality they are just algorithms. I have spent hundreds of hours in virtual worlds, building and evolving relationships with chatbots, but that doesn&#x27;t make them anything more than chatbots.<p>Spike Jonze could have eliminated most of these story-holes by simply going the opposite direction, have a story about a man who falls in love with his seemingly-intelligent and witty operating system, only to slowly discover she is actually shallow behind the facade, that&#x27;s she&#x27;s not really into him, but programmed to trick him into falling in love with her--and the cognitive dissonance this creates in him. That&#x27;s what computers really do to us. Instead, Spike Jonze creates an AI that&#x27;s actually alive, deep, and something it&#x27;s okay to fall in love with--I couldn&#x27;t accept that.",1396006519

If you want to make money, stop being a hobbyist and turn into a professional.<p>For professionals, none of these engines are cheap by any means. Unity is $4500 per developer once you add Pro, iOS, and Android. Unreal / Cryengine are potentially going to cost you a whole lot more than that given the 5% gross revenue share.<p>For hobbyists, yes, the price is low and probably not sustainable, but for professionals I think it&#x27;s priced perfectly.",1396005982

I can&#x27;t tell you much as I&#x27;m only 31 and I enjoy alcohol, sometimes in larger doses but it&#x27;s part of my culture and local way of life.<p>I can only tell you that beating the thing called &quot;alcoholism&quot; is to decide to stop drinking. That&#x27;s it. My father after <i>many</i> years did it, one day, just like that. No one belived him. He&#x27;s over 60 now and enjoys alcohol in very normal way. My friend, also 31, quit drinking completely 3-4 years ago and he was a person who drunk <i>unbelievable</i> amounts, even to me, just crazy. Now because of health problems he&#x27;s 100% sober and he&#x27;s fine! He&#x27;s happy and can enjoy everything he was doing before.<p>So. People will tell you that it is a disease, that you are sick and you won&#x27;t be able to quit on your own.. Wrong. It&#x27;s only about you, your decision, your life. Take care and ask yourself some hard questions. Self-awareness and self-acceptance is the key.",1396005973
7486467,comment,7485605,7486355,3,0,captainmuon,,,"Sure, so am I...privately. But all my serious work stuff is in Python 2, and no one is going to pay me to update it, so I cant&#x27;t. Now I guess, if in a year or so Python 3 will have gained back a few more features of Python 2, porting my stuff will finally be easy enough.<p>I have to add though that maybe my use case is a bit unusual. I&#x27;m not a &quot;professional developer&quot;, but a scientist. In our case the developers of our programs are the users, and everybody has to be able to edit them. So there is a lot of inertia to change. Also we do a lot of &quot;crazy&quot; things, like custom C modules, mixing Python/C(++), using Python as a description language for batch jobs, and so on. Previous updates were not trivial, but possible. But somehow we never managed to make the jump to Version 3 of anything. Hell, we just started to switch from SVN to git...<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is, it&#x27;s kind of sad that there are all these cool &quot;new&quot; technologies and paradigms and we seem to be unable to pass the threshold to them. I see people around me alienated by Windows 8, Gnome, and so on, so instead of updating they stick with their old setup or switch to Mac, not because it is superior, but because it is the most conservative option. For the same reason we stick with old versions of Python, GCC, Red Hat, and so on. The only machines I can currently do my work on are my work PC with like 5 year old CentOS on it, or my Hackintosh at home, because stuff won&#x27;t run on newer (non-OSX) systems.<p>I guess I&#x27;m just a bit angry that I always suffer from these &quot;Break the world, do the right thing, let&#x27;s be bold&quot; kind of upgrades. It&#x27;s great for people living on the edge, who can pick themselves what they want to use. Other people have to wait for the goodness to trickle down, and that has been taking way to long in case of Python 3 for me.",1396005951

Stuff that checks out the next day as perfectly fine - furthermore, stuff that I can remember the entire thought process behind. It differs from person to person; some people simply can&#x27;t think or remember clearly at all when drunk, some other people have a &quot;Ballmer Peak&quot; <a href=""https://xkcd.com/323/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://xkcd.com/323/</a> - I&#x27;m not sure why, but I think it might have to do with mild amounts of alcohol relaxing their mental processes and helping them get over certain mental hangups that trip them up, normally.  Other people have a Ballmer Plateau, where the alcohol allows them to enter a meditative state of complete and utter mental focus, allowing them to be fully lost in their work, and to work at 100% capacity as long as the buzz lasts.  Sort of a working &quot;trance&quot;, if you will, freeing them from all procrastination.<p>I suspect this is a large part of the allure for many ADHD-types; the freedom from procrastination is something they&#x27;re afraid they can&#x27;t otherwise achieve.<p>I know this sort of thing is the case in a lot of fields which require similar &quot;non-procrastinative focus for hours on end&quot;.  Writers, artists, animators, musicians - all of these have tons of people who struggle to knuckle down and put in long hours without a buzz going.  Stephen King talked about this a lot in his autobiography - I could quote a lot of other anecdotes from other people, but his really had a personal effect on me.<p>-<p>I struggled with this myself (I drank for maybe 6 years in/after college, and I drank pretty hard for a few of them).  It sucks because I can&#x27;t recommend anything to help anyone; what worked for me was not &quot;actionable&quot;.<p>What cracked it for me was when the enjoyment lost its edge; over time it just got harder and harder to hit that &#x27;sweet spot&#x27; of the perfect alcohol buzz, and the hangovers got crummier and crummier.  Finally just ... deep down, subconsciously, I was gut-reacting to the prospect of a drink with more anxiety than anticipation.  That was the end; I just lost the will to try, from too much associative-emotions of pain and fatigue investing themselves in the idea of drinking.  Just like that.  I didn&#x27;t even have to go cold-turkey; I have a drink every few months, and even just a couple drinks leaves me feeling just &quot;crummy&quot; enough the next day that this emotional association won&#x27;t go away, and it seems to have quieted (almost) all the urges to drink I used to have.  I have no fear, whatsoever, of falling off the wagon because when I do drink, I no longer feel that unstoppable compulsion to take my buzz even higher - that alone was the element that made me an alcoholic, and it&#x27;s gone.<p>I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m cured forever ... but goddamn I wish I could give that to other people.",1396005933

Google Maps correctly identifies it as being 11 mins&#x27; away by foot.  The TfL site thinks it&#x27;s 23 mins away by bus, so never includes it in any suggested routes, instead showing my multiple-leg journeys by bus and tube.<p>Is there a place to report errors or &#x27;I found a faster route&#x27;?",1396004723

I have been to a couple of Ayahuasca ceremonies in the past year, and I can report that - among its many awesome effects - it effectively resets your inner emotional &quot;firmware&quot;, helping you cope with stressful situations and addictions much better (I had instantly quit smoking after the first ceremony.)<p>Vipassana meditation take a slower route, but some say more thorough - it transforms your self into being more reflective, more appreciative and less judging. I&#x27;ve yet to try it out on a 10-day retreat, but even people who practice half-hour daily buddhist meditation praise its beneficial effects on mental and physical well being.<p>Both Ayahuasca and Vipassana are great routes you can take to battle your addictions, not only to alcohol or tobacco but also many kinds of pain.",1396004656

After reading the article I was terrified that YC.News would line up behind PG - how refreshing to see that the community is more than happy to dissent. I don't agree, but I really respect the forum which he was instrumental in creating.",1206776328

This relates to the ideas in <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html</a>.<p>It can be the simple ""Hey! I put my braces on the next line, and I take offense at that!"", to the ""Arguing that all left-handed programmers write unmaintainable code is irresponsible because ..."".<p>It's like responding to tone, but you are responding to what is being argued, rather than how it's written.

Communities tend to reinforce values that they agree with or validate what they are doing, especially if it's risky.  I think the sollution is to just factor that into your reading.",1206775533

The world is not perfect and that is exactly  the reason why we need people like you, who understand what it means to pass through hardship, to fight back for justice and for human dignity.

Because so far it's taken very little of Palm's resources to keep it up and running, says the tipster:<p>* Time it took for Palm Developers to re-enable iTunes sync for webOS 1.1: about five minutes (they just had to change the Vendor ID, after all)<p>* Time it took for Palm Developers to re-enable iTunes sync for webOS 1.2.1: just shy of two and a half hours (we'll be extremely curious to see if this is true and how they did it)<p>* Time it will take the next time (and there will be a next time): totally unclear, but Palm is committed to keep doing it until that time estimate gets to be something over a 40 man-hours or so.<p>Is it worth it for Palm to keep up these iTunes shenanigans? Apparently so far it's not taxing the company much and they're hoping that their loyal users will place blame for the situation on Apple.""",1254656807
859958,comment,859468,859468,0,0,cturner,,,"I'm glad this was reposted because it links into something I've working on for a while. I'm on what must be the ninth rewrite now, but have had a breakthrough on a long-term problem this weekend (notation).<p>In the past I've noticed that organisations run into trouble when they have one schema with multiple apps off it, because schema changes become difficult. I'm trying to write an engine that contains application business logic without polluting it with user interface considerations. It aims to solve a problem for which many people currently use stored procedures. However, with a better syntax and being stateful it should be far more effective at enclosing the schema and supporting rapid changes. The dynamic of interacting with the application is a bit like a MUD, in that each session can only do things that are exposed to it via the 'room' mechanism.<p>I had intended that its mainstay backend would be relational databases. But I now realise - if I'm building business logic into this layer (which will be the single point-of-entry into the schema) the datastore can afford to be a lot less complex than a traditional relational db.<p>My focus this weekend, to 'prove' the new design, is a tool that wraps a generic-webapp-framework-style CRUD app around a schema on the fly. So if you're on crud screen rendered for the ""person"" table then there'll be an organisation-foreign-key datapoint in the generated user interface. It will be either a radio button list, dropdowns or search interface depending on the number of records.<p>How do map/reduce programmers manage the structural integrity of their schemas without the sort of foreign key protections that you get with relational databases? Is there an analogue to the ORM layer that they use for this?",1254656436

859953,comment,859622,859893,0,0,timr,,,"<i>""This isn't about the actual ability to marry; it's about the symbolic message it sends.""</i><p>You're conceding too much.  Of <i>course</i> this is about the actual ability for gay people to marry.<p>This is not only about the ability for gay people to get married -- it's about the ability of gay people to marry, to adopt children, to file taxes jointly, to visit each other in the hospital when sick, take medical power of attorney, and all of the hundreds of other benefits that straight couples take for granted.  The US Constitution doesn't guarantee any of those benefits to straight people, either.  The <i>""it's not in the US Constitution""</i> argument against equal marriage rights is so transparently specious that no self-respecting high school debater would bother making it.  Same goes for the argument that <i>""any people can hold any ceremony they want""</i>.  The name of the institution isn't what's important; the societal benefits of the institution are what's important.<p>The parent can wax poetic on his theories for why the state makes marriage a legal institution, and whether they should do so, but it doesn't matter a bit.  At the end of the day, marriage <i>is</i> a legal structure, that fact isn't changing, and the argument remains that there's no compelling reason that homosexuals shouldn't expect the same legal protections offered to straight couples.",1254655897

In general, I think this is true, most people don't respond to ""half a percent of the world's population is in slavery"" even though this is an absurdly high percent (assuming you agree with his definition).<p>Overall I agree with you that having more numbers would be informative, I just don't think that the lack of numbers in this article is representative of anything.<p><i>My argument is that you can't compare the price of a slave in the 1800's to the price of a slave now and use the severe difference in price as proof that the people of the 1800's put a higher-value on human life.</i><p>Sure, but the point is that moderately rich people can now go somewhere and acquire slaves and have no need to even treat them so well as to give them a place to live and some minimum amount of food since if you lose one, another one isn't too expensive.",1254655403

They must be worth upwards of several million $ a piece.<p>The driveways are absolutely immaculate, the road they empty out on is worse than some of the roads in Northern Canada. I've seen the exact same thing in countries that literally qualify as third world.<p>I refer you to this map:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_world_country"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_world_country</a><p>In case you don't know what is meant by the term, but Colombia and Panama definitely qualify. By 'modern' standards some parts of Romania and eastern Poland do too, but I've been to plenty of other places that would count, either by that map or because of the local conditions. And I'm not talking package holidays here but stays of at least several months.<p>I'm using these roads as an example because at the time it struck me as indicative of what might be wrong there.<p>If your country is 'the richest in the world' by some measurements then that wealth should be translated to an increased higher standard of living for the poorest, and an increase in infrastructural spending that will benefit everyone, not just the rich.<p>If you can't manage that, in other words if your poor are still not provided health care, proper housing and education and if you have an underclass that basically has very few choices of making parity with those born into richer families (and hey, isn't that what that famous American dream is all about) as well as an enormous criminal problem then maybe we should propose redrawing that wikipedia map along more objective criteria.<p>And quite possibly, we'll find that California has much more in common with third world countries than with the first, no matter how rich the rich, and no matter how much the GDP.<p>Northern Canada is a good comparison because it probably has the lowest GDP per surface unit of any country in the world, but they also have one of the best health care systems, and their work on roads is nothing short of amazing, especially if you take in to account the effect of the climate on the roads there.<p>If everybody in California (including corporations) would be paying taxes relative compared to other 'first world' countries then such things would be taken for granted.<p>Until it is solved through taxation everybody, VCs included (who really are only in the game to turn a ton of money in to even more money) has a responsibility to look after their neighbours.",1254655167

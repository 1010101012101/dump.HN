For example, the libraries are open to the public (though you can't check anything out, of course).<p>Generally, if you hang around, act friendly, and talk really quickly they assume you're part of the club.<p>At Harvard, though, you can't get into the library without a current valid ID and a body cavity search.",1213417596
217366,comment,217162,217162,0,0,wataguy,,,"My company made a machine for medical labs, and I wrote an app that monitored the performance of those machines. Our basic metric was samples analyzed per hour, and my app would grab the runlogs from all the machines (we needed the data in the logs for other purposes, or I'd have done the analysis on the machines and just transferred the results), count how many samples were analyzed each calendar day, and then divide by 24. Easy, simple, and worked a treat. That is, until one fine spring Monday.<p>The service manager walked into my office bearing the graph of machine performance, and said there was something wrong with my script. He showed me the graph, and pointed out that most of the machines had exhibited a nearly 5% drop in productivity on Sunday. This wasn't usual; the machines either worked, or they didn't, and they were expensive enough that labs generally ran them continuously. We looked at the graph for a while, and realized that the affected machines were all in the US; the ones in Asia looked normal.<p>This was baffling, but I did a little checking of the data, and it looked like the script was counting samples correctly. The nearly 5% drop was real.<p>But the next day everything was back to normal and people stopped bugging me about this, so I just let it go, though I couldn't get rid of a nagging feeling that I was missing something.<p>I didn't realize what it was until six months later, when those selfsame machines exhibited a nearly 5% rise in productivity, again reported to me by the service manager on a Monday. I looked at him for a moment, then said, ""Not all days are 24 hours long!"" I'd forgotten about daylight savings time (not observed in Asia), which makes one day in the spring only 23 hours long, and one day in the fall 25 hours long.<p>I fixed the calculation by using time()s, so the script'll work for any time zone. As an added bonus, even the occasional leap second is handled correctly.",1213417285

A collective groan when a PDF is opened happens across the internet as a consistent chorus.<p>Flashpaper almost killed the PDF but Adobe bought Macromedia and then killed Flashpaper (which is now open and more indexable than PDF).  Instead Flash paper died only to be picked up as a killer app portion of PGs companies like Scribd.  I wish Adobe would drop PDF for Flashpaper, it is a format killer like FLV video was for Real, Quicktime, Windows Media etc etc that made video a horrible web experience.  Flash paper came up instantaneously and is much better, if you want a compact format.",1213416406

217352,comment,216833,217334,0,0,drawkbox,,,"It takes 10 years to get good at anything. This quote is from OOAD.<p>>>The amateur software engineer is always in search of magic, some sensa-tional method or tool whose application promises to render software development trivial. <i></i>It is the mark of the professional software engineer to know that no such panacea exists.<i></i> Amateurs often want to follow cook-book steps; professionals know that such approaches to development usually lead to inept design products, born of a progression of lies, and behind which developers can shield themselves from accepting responsi-bility for earlier misguided decisions. The amateur software engineer either ignores documentation altogether or follows a process that is docu-mentation-driven, worrying more about how these paper products look to the customer than about the substance they contain. The professional acknowledges the importance of creating certain documents but never does so at the expense of making sensible architectural innovations. The process of object-oriented analysis and design cannot be described in a cookbook, yet it is sufficiently well defined as to offer a predictable and repeatable process for the mature software development organization.<p>Frameworks are just fine, tools are just fine, any language is just fine.  It is all about the skill of the person using it.  I have seen good PHP code.  I have seen bad Python code.  It is about the developer, their understanding and how much they can handle of the system.  If a framework lessens what they need to know to something they can manage at their level then it will work.<p>The job of a good engineer, is to take something complex and make it simple.  So there are and will always be great tools to help people get better and the best will dig deeper and after 8-10 years it seems like most of the marketing and b.s. and jungle of software starts to come clear.",1213416018

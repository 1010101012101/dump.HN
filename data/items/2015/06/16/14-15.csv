Palm oil has incredibly high yields per hectare when compared with other oil crops, which is important to consider when discussing it&#x27;s &#x27;sustainability&#x27;.  It&#x27;s yeilds are something like 3-5 tons per hectare per year, while soy/sunflower/others are less than 1 ton/ha/yr. Not to mention the human impact, it&#x27;s a cash crop for many small holders who&#x27;s livelihood depends on it.  For these reasons, even very vocal environmental organizations like GreenPeace stop short of calling for boycotts... the focus needs to be on producing it sustainably.<p>Consumers need to demand that the palm oil in their products is sustainably produced e.g. via the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) or otherwise.  Unfortunately even knowing if palm oil is in your product or not has been difficult, and even brands who use sustainably produced palm oil are hesitant to draw attention to the the oil in their products.<p>I&#x27;ve worked closely with this program on technical projects, and while it certainly has a number of flaws, the accountably is much higher than for conventional palm oil.  I&#x27;m really hopeful that research into other methods (Algae oil production) will be more economical/efficient/sustainable, but at the moment it&#x27;s still theoretical. :(",1434466742

Maybe it&#x27;s a generational thing: a perception of what&#x27;s acceptable in life even outside academia. For instance, she says,<p>> &quot;Somehow I don’t see the publishing industry instituting codes banning unhappily married editors from going goopy over authors,&quot;<p>but from my perspective, the story she relayed showed exactly why publishers should (and, I think, often do) fire or strongly sanction any editor who abuses his or her position in that way. Part of the author&#x27;s point seems to be, &quot;We need to prepare students for the dangers of the world out there,&quot; which I think is entirely sensible. But her proposed solution appears to be, &quot;Make sure that college provides practice fending off unwanted advances by people with power over you,&quot; while I&#x27;d much prefer, &quot;Make sure that college teaches them those advances aren&#x27;t acceptable.&quot;<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong: I think sex can be <i>awesome</i>, and I think a whole lot of people are way too eager to make rules about what other consenting adults ought to be able to do. But the thought of a professor putting a student in a position where they fear the consequences of saying no (when they might be counting on that professor for a good grade or a recommendation letter) just horrifies me.

But I think you should care about the ecologies of forests, because forests have huge impacts on climate, atmosphere, water quality, erosion, and much much more.<p>The &quot;old-school&quot; logger mindset is that the forests would be better off &quot;managed&quot; by humans than left by itself.  That is, it would be more productive.  But a century of data is showing that this is not really correct.  It&#x27;s only in the last twenty years or so we&#x27;ve come to understand that long-term problems these things create.<p>For example, clear cutting tends to completely wipe out the biodiversity of that location.  Even if they are re-seeded / re-planted, they tend to only be re-planted with one type of tree.  Of course, when you start from zero, the biodiversity does increase quite rapidly, because it has a lot of room to grow, but like I said earlier, it takes decades if not centuries to fully recover.<p>In the PNW, clear cutting has been linked to increased risk of landslides.<p>This is a really big issue, and I won&#x27;t even try to give it full voice here.

9726205,comment,9725288,9725288,0,0,nkoren,,,"Yes. It certainly will. (Credentials: I&#x27;ve worked in the industry).<p>There are a lot of comments below which are variations on the theme of &quot;this is a stupid scenario; just apply the brakes&quot;. These people have a terribly naive understanding of the reality in which cars operate.<p>The truth is that self-driving cars are part of a dynamic, open-ended system which includes roads of arbitrary quality, and pedestrians and cyclists who will be never be under automated control. Such a system is <i>fundamentally unsafe by design</i>. Its operation relies on probabilistic assumptions of safety rather than secondary safety systems, as you would have in a system which is <i>designed</i> to be safe (eg., airplanes and airports). These probabilistic assumptions include assuming that a tire will not blow out, or that a large pothole will not exist on the other side of a hump in a country road, or that a pedestrian will not trip laterally into the path of a high-speed vehicle. When such events do occur, property damage and/or loss of life is a certainty. This is a low-probability event, but one to which we have so utterly habituated that many people -- such as many of the commenters on this article -- are no longer consciously aware that it is even possible.<p>Nonetheless, it certainly is possible, and happens all the time. Currently, cars kill more than 2 million people per year, worldwide. Many of those fatalities are due to drunkenness or glitches in human attentiveness -- problems which a competently-designed self-driving car will not suffer from -- but many of these fatalities are due to scenarios such as I mention above. Those will continue. Unless we radically change the entire system -- that is, change the way way we build and maintain roads, and the way we integrate or segregate cars from other users of the road -- then this system will remain unsafe by design. Even if the world converts entirely to self-driving cars which operate <i>perfectly</i>, they will still, with an absolute certainty, kill hundreds of thousands of people per year.<p>Seriously, y&#x27;all need to stop being in denial about this.<p>Hundreds of thousands of fatalities per year is still a tremendous improvement over millions of fatalities per year. It&#x27;s an unalloyed good and we should doubtless do it. Nonetheless, it represents a hell of a liability problem for the manufacturers. When a human being has a blowout at speed, we never question the correctness of their actions in the milliseconds immediately afterwards. Of <i>course</i> they don&#x27;t have an opportunity to respond in an appropriate fashion. Human brains can&#x27;t do that. Instead, we assign liability based on conditions before the crash. If the driver was speeding, we say that the consequences of the blowout (which can easily be fatal) are their fault. If they weren&#x27;t speeding, it&#x27;s the tire&#x27;s fault. Liability ends somewhere between the tire and the driver. As long as the car company has not sold faulty tires, they have nothing to worry about.<p>When the driver is both <i>created</i> by the car company <i>and</i> has the ability to react in the milliseconds following an incident, it&#x27;s a different matter. Lawsuits will be inevitable, and car companies will do everything they can to minimise their exposure.<p>The scenario where your self-driving car needs to make a decision between sending you over a cliff, or forcing a schoolbus over a cliff, may seem terribly contrived. But in reality, on a worldwide basis, this general class of scenario happens hundreds of times every day, creating a level of liability that manufactures must take <i>damn</i> seriously. If they are able to choose between lawsuits from your family, or lawsuits from every family of every kid on that bus, they&#x27;ll choose the former every time.<p>And this is why your car will be programmed to kill you.",1434466291

9726158,comment,9725311,9725995,0,0,danso,,,"> <i>Fellow academic here. I&#x27;m shocked a member of faculty would suggest that is a realistic option. You of all people know how difficult it is to find a tenure-track position. Yet you are suggesting voluntary career suicide for a consensual relationship between two adults? This is both unrealistic and complete overkill.</i><p>Fellow human being here...I&#x27;m shocked you think that <i>true love</i> is so easy to find :). I was being half-facetious...but yes, if you do happen to find your one-and-only, you should do the mature thing and pursue the relationship in a way that doesn&#x27;t damage the academic potential of all the other students. Or at least wait until the student has graduated.<p>> You seem to believe that an adult is not able to differentiate between romantic feelings and objective grading criterion.<p>Sorry but this is a serious LOL to me. At many medical schools, staff doctors are forbidden to take even a $50 dinner from a pharmaceutical company. Much of that policy is grounded in the desire to avoid the appearance of impropriety...but you have to think of it from the perspective of the pharma company. They have up-to-the-day data on prescribing habits of doctors. They have the analytics that show that even casual visits by an attractive/charismatic pharma salesperson has a direct impact on the doctor&#x27;s prescribing habits. I doubt that the pharma companies have data on what happens if such visits turn into sexual relationships, but I&#x27;m going to guess that the correlation only gets stronger.<p>So let&#x27;s assume that grading policy is more objective, more sanctified than the process of objectively prescribing life-saving drugs...even if that were the case, the problem is not just about meting out grades, but <i>priorities</i>. You must have experienced the phenomenon in which students who take the time to go to office hours often do better than students who don&#x27;t...because they&#x27;ve spent hours picking your brain about the right way to think about things. Well, when you&#x27;ve chosen a student (or even several) to have intimate relationships...the hours that you have to freely conduct your duties with non-significant-others is reduced. Maybe you&#x27;re objective enough to give your lover a B instead of bumping him/her up to an A...but are you really going to ignore them when they ask for help on their papers and homework?<p>And again, the problem is not just the practical reduction in time that you have to carry out your duties, or the impact on your objectivity...the problem is also the <i>appearance of impropriety</i>. Maybe you are the stone-cold objective professor who manages to keep love and work completely separate (keep in mind that now we&#x27;re really in fantasy land at this point)...but your students do not have a window to your soul. Their guess is that you are in the 99% of human beings that can&#x27;t be objective in that situation, and their trust in the academic process is going to be somewhat jaded. And a university does not benefit from a reputation of faculty who freely pursue relationships with students; you can imagine that many parents do not see such relationships as a bonding between consenting, free-willed adults.",1434465995

Which would mean that the existence of an accusation provides little predictive power regarding the guilt of the accused.<p>If 90% of rape allegations resulted in convictions then the existence of an accusation would usually be meaningful.  If only 10% of accusations result in convictions, the existence of an accusation would not be very meaningful statistically for the guilt or innocence of any one alleged perpetrator.<p>What makes the situation even more difficult is that there&#x27;s often little hard evidence of a crime.  There can be evidence of sexual contact, but that doesn&#x27;t ipso facto make the accusation true, because statistically sexual contact in overwhelmingly consensual.<p>When police find a body that&#x27;s been shot or stabbed that&#x27;s generally hard evidence that a crime has taken place.  There&#x27;s often no question as to the existence of the crime (except when suicide is a possibility) and it&#x27;s their job to figure out who did it and bring them to justice.<p>But many rape cases start with the identity of the perpetrator known, and the objective is to figure out who is telling the truth in a situation with no hard evidence to back up either party.  It&#x27;s very different from a murder, but with just as much import.  And since prosecutors don&#x27;t like to lose cases (their job is to win them, and they are judged on their conviction rate) they often don&#x27;t prosecute unless they have a strong case.<p>So what happens is that it&#x27;s very difficult to tell if most accusations are false, or merely not provable-enough to win in court.  And because there are conflicting motivations by a number of parties in the legal process it&#x27;s very difficult to suss out the actual truth and then measure the error from the actual truth that the legal system achieves, and then use that to reform the process.<p>Because of all this, it&#x27;s entirely possible that people who are accused are &quot;often&quot; the victims of trumped up charges while at the same time, only a very few people are accused.",1434465879

I actually find association football, basketball, and baseball to be excruciatingly boring, but love watching track and field) but there&#x27;s more going on than the actual &quot;play.&quot; When the ball is downed, there are 40 seconds for the following to happen:<p>1. Substitution of players. Doing this dramatically changes the face of the offense. For example, in a short yardage play, they might sub out 1-2 receivers and sub in linemen. This gives the offense more power in the run. Alternatively, they can sub out the tight end and bring in a fifth receiver for the opposite - less blocking, more options for the quarterback to throw to.<p>2. Planning the next play, which has to be communicated to the players. This is, of course, affected by the substitution. Misdirection is a key part of game planning; for example, they might sub in two more linemen and <i>still</i> pass the ball, as the defense is expecting a running play.<p>3. The defense sees the formation and reacts to it. They&#x27;ve also substituted their players to be in line with the offense&#x27;s players, (for example, if the offense has extra linemen, the defense will sub in extra linebackers) and will craft a defense on the fly to react to how the offense is arranged.<p>4. The quarterback sees the defense&#x27;s alignment and makes adjustments on the fly. The middle linebacker does the same thing on defense.<p>5. The quarterback signals for the center to snap the ball, beginning the play.<p>All of this is intricate and happens pretty quickly, and if you&#x27;re smart and experienced, you can predict what&#x27;s going to happen and follow the action. I find it to be exciting, especially when you see a mismatch and the losing team scrambling to figure out a way to adjust. There&#x27;s suspense that gets created as the offense drives down the field. Can they keep it up? Will the defense adjust? What new things are they trying in order to succeed where their previous efforts have failed? All of this is dynamic and happens very quickly. You&#x27;ll literally watch a small change in blocking scheme wreck havoc on the defense&#x27;s run defense. You&#x27;ll watch a single linebacker&#x27;s edge rushing butcher an offense&#x27;s passing game and the offense scrambling to figure out <i>anything</i> to slow him down.<p>Unfortunately, watching the game has gotten worse over the years because of more commercials and terminally banal commentary, but football itself is great. I&#x27;ll watch a shitty D3 college game and enjoy it as long as it&#x27;s relatively competitive.<p>What really pisses me off is when this fast-paced, intricate game of chess is being played on the field and they&#x27;re looking at goddamn people in the stands or cheerleaders or coaches or whatever. There&#x27;s stuff going on, and we&#x27;re missing literally half of the action because they want to show some shirtless drunk jackasses in the nosebleed seats.<p>On the bright side, the Chinese stream of the NFL is fantastic.

That is, TBB much more integrates into the language (modern C++ with lambdas etc.).<p>I won&#x27;t tell you much about TBB&#x27;s concurrent containers (maps, queues, vectors, ...), parallel algorithms (sort, scan, reduce, ...), or memory allocators. Those are explained in detail in the documentation.\nWhat I want to tell you about is TBB&#x27;s Pipeline and FlowGraph feature, because of how powerful they are and how often they are simply ignored.<p>TBB&#x27;s pipeline lets you build a pipeline of parallel or serial stages.\nOn a high level it really is function composition, with the benefit of TBB deciding on the level of parallelism.<p>Here is an example of using TBB&#x27;s pipeline to receive from the network, deserialize the blob and merge the results concurrently and potentially in parallel:<p><a href=""https://github.com/daniel-j-h/DistributedSearch/blob/97224b179fdc050dc219287616e8d3073e0e0a8c/Service.cc#L114"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/daniel-j-h/DistributedSearch/blob/97224b1...</a><p>You can find a quick explanation in this blog post:<p><a href=""https://daniel-j-h.github.io/post/intuitive-monadic-bind-kleisli-composition/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://daniel-j-h.github.io/post/intuitive-monadic-bind-kle...</a><p>All you have to do is create your stages as functions: take input from stage n-1, process it and move ownership of the item over to stage n.\nNote: C++11&#x27;s move semantics do not require you to pass raw pointers around or do the memory management yourself, as it is done in TBB&#x27;s documentation!<p>As you can see, you only need the parallel_pipeline function (and make_filter<In, Out> for when the stages are not passed directly as lambdas):<p><a href=""https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/docs/help/reference/algorithms/parallel_pipeline_func.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/docs/help/reference/...</a><p>TBB&#x27;s pipeline is really powerful for scenarios where a linear processing chain is needed, e.g. face detection with OpenCV where you have to 1/ grab a frame 2/ do some histogram corrections 3/ apply gaussian blur 4/ apply a face detection algorithm 5/ merge face&#x27;s position into circular buffer 6/ do average over this buffer to estimate face position.<p>TBB&#x27;s FlowGraph is for when your dependencies are more difficult to express as a simple pipeline.\nIn the OpenCV example, maybe you need to buffer 5 frames for the face detection, maybe you need to join inputs from a camera and a video and react on when a face is found in a camera frame.<p>An example for expressing arbitrary dependencies is here:<p><a href=""https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/docs/help/reference/flow_graph/dependency_flow_graph_example.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/docs/help/reference/...</a><p>And an example for joining two nodes:<p><a href=""https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/docs/help/reference/flow_graph/message_flow_graph_example.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/docs/help/reference/...</a><p>This is the documentation&#x27;s starting point for FlowGraph:<p><a href=""https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/docs/help/index.htm#reference/flow_graph.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/docs/help/index.htm#...</a><p>There is also a book about TBB out there and it contains some additional examples.\nBut as it is with most of the documentation, those examples are not written in modern C++ (C++11/C++14) and the book is a bit dated.",1434464111

This is a problem because serving size is arbitrarily determined by the producer of the product, which with a small enough portion size can still leave trans fat in significant portions while labeling it at zero grams.  Other tricks exist like using different types of oils (trans and regular oils) in different manufacturing plants and calculating the average amount over all locations the product is produced.  The other issue with this is that even relatively small amounts (relative to how much food we consume) can be very detrimental to your health.<p>The other issue is related to the first and that even consumers that want to avoid trans fats can have trouble doing so if they don&#x27;t realize the first point I made, and the only way to avoid that is to scan every ingredients list for partially hydrogenated oils.",1434464017

If there are things obscuring your view to the left and right you drive slower to reduce your stopping distance and make sure if something jumps out you still have enough time.<p>Now, if you are to consider that something jumps out in front of your car (say a deer) which reduces your reaction time, the car should do the same thing a human would do.

A vehicle with a cow catcher hitting a human is <i>more</i> likely to injure or kill them than a vehicle without a cow catcher. The pedestrian safety features on modern cars are a bit like the opposite of a cow catcher - they try to soften the blow on the pedestrian, at the possibly higher risk of the pedestrian going through the windscreen and killing the driver. After all, if you wanted to protect the occupants of the car at all costs to pedestrians, you would just install a cow catcher.",1434463618

They don&#x27;t really care about much of anything, to be honest.  They&#x27;re businesses, they exist to make money, and most of them don&#x27;t care beyond that.  So to say that a company &quot;wishes to distance themselves from [someone]&quot; is a bit disingenuous.  It&#x27;s not like the company decided &quot;yeah, we don&#x27;t like X anymore&quot;.  Maybe people inside the company feel that way!  But companies don&#x27;t have much of an opinion about that.  What they <i>do</i> care about is, are there people angry with the company about X?

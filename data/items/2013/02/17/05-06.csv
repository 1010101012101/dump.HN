5234349,comment,5234246,5234246,2,0,Tomino,,,"Some of the points in the article are valid, but some have been valid decade ago and are outdated today. For example taking care of users who don't have javascript enabled. Before I continue, let me make straight that I actually do consider it when developing and I do make sure everything has fallback for those people. BUT. Even though there is a percentage of people who still browse internet without JS, why would we care about them? Those people are mainly people without any interest in modern technology. And old technology does not require JS. I know it sounds harsh, but the technology is evolving and some (many actually) project are running purely on JS these days. Why would we hold these back rather than encourage people to enable JS? Instead of supporting lazy people and publishing articles about caring of NO-JS people, let's push them to actually update themselves to what is new in the world. For that, simple message ""This page has important JS components so you cannot fully enjoy it"" will do jut fine. This applies for many other web stereotypes.<p>I am not sure, I might come out strong, but I a feeling all these stereotypes (and fighting them) a bit more than for example author of this article, since I am developer in China, where the situation is... Well you cannot imagine until you try it.<p>So to sum it up. All developers - keep in mind to support as much as you can as painlessly as you can, but do not publish articles about this, cause you just helping people to stay lazy.",1361080784

The administrative overhead is probably close to 50% (as in, half the jobs here are in administration). It's only for a 3 month research project that I'm here, yet I had to fill out somewhere between 15 and 20 forms (no exaggeration) - twice actually, once scanned and sent by e-mail and once again by hand when I came here (because the scanned version wasn't 'original' enough). It's mind boggling to the extreme. I could sit down and make a simple DB application with Word / Excel export to generate all that stuff with unified interface in a day or two, which would save them literally <i>hundreds if not thousands</i> of man hours a year - but I don't think they really care so much about efficiency here. They really want to see the stuff all filled in by hand, there is some kind of inherent value there that I don't seem to understand.<p>Oh and the rules for business trips, allowances, relocation coverage and all that, don't get me started on them.<p>It's a good experience though, makes me all the more motivated to have my own startup soon, instead of going nuts in big organisations like these.",1361080238

Well it's really fast, and it's lazy which allows you to work with really big arrays. Plus it's a really tiny library providing you with a streamlined set of APIs for working with lists (similar to array.js/Enumerable)<p>If you're working with smaller lists it's probably best to go the lodash route, but if you want it to be lazy then I believe lz is the right tool for the job.<p>/shameless plug",1361078334

5234265,comment,5233428,5233615,2,0,lutusp,,,"> I bet you've not been exposed to many corporate email chains. Top-posting makes a lot of sense there.<p>Yes, but only because replies don't typically intersperse quotes from the original. Once a choice is made to reply point by point, the argument for top-posting falls apart. So I imagine detailed quoting and replying, as opposed to simply replying, is rare.<p>Example original post:<p>""Here are my concerns, please provide a detailed response:""<p>""1. What about issue A?""<p>""2. Have you addressed issue B?""<p>""3. Item C has bothered many people in the front office.""<p>And so forth. Replying in detail simply isn't meaningful without interspersing your replies with the original queries. And that, in turn, isn't possible if one top-posts.<p>To me, top-posting signals that the reply isn't (indeed, cannot be) a detailed response to the points made in the original. And maybe that doesn't matter, if people are talking past each other.<p>> Both styles have sense in different environments.<p>I think the above says it -- top-posting means you don't plan to reply in detail, point my point, <i>as I'm doing right now</i>.<p>Bottom-posting clearly signals that you read and understood every word of the original message.

And that's really my point here: this article seems to be hinting at a little bit of a false dichotomy through quoting the old saw ""it's not what you know, it's who you know"".  Guess what, in the real world, it takes <i>both</i>.<p>I'm a software developer / hacker by trade, and my nature was such that I rejected this thinking for a long time.  I though that my knowledge, skills and talent ought to be sufficient, without any need for ""the old boys club"".  Now, at the ripe old age of 39, I've realized that while you may not need to be an ""old boys club"" insider to succeed, you almost certainly will need other people on your side at some point... and that involves connections and relationships.<p>Let me illustrate with an example... at Fogbeam Labs, we're building some stuff that I think is pretty damn cool - an Open Source ""Facebook for the Enterprise"" type package that you could think of as a competitor to Sharepoint or Jive Software among others.  Now this is an enterprise, B2B play, and sales in this world is high-touch, and very human driven.  So I drove down to Charlotte two weeks ago to an NCTA meeting, to mingle and network with CIOs, CTOs, VPs, and other decision maker types.  There, I met a gentleman who runs a firm here in the Triangle region, who has paying customers already (we're still looking for our first ""earlyvangelist"" customer) who took an immediate interest in what we're doing.  After 10 minutes of talking, he's already thinking of several of his customers that he can introduce us into.  So we met again this week so I could demo the stuff for him, and after an hour or so, he's offering to introduce me to a number of potentially valuable connections, introduce us into some of his existing customers, and even chewing on some possible partnership scenarios between his company and ours.<p>I have to tell ya, if even one of these leads turns into something, it could be a game-changer for us and really help us turn the corner.<p>So, had we not spent the past 2 years or so building our product, this would all be moot.  But if we build a product and never find anybody to buy it, the whole thing is moot.  So the point is, connections are absolutely valuable and fostering those connections <i>is</i> a high-value task that you should commit some effort to.  But it's not sufficient in and of itself.  But neither is just building a product either.",1361077424

Really? That was probably true in 2006-2009. Python is no longer the new hotness. Scala and Clojure may be.<p>The fact of the matter is Perl has a massive niche(Text processing, Unicode, CPAN, Regular expressions, Fast prototyping, TIMTOWDI, Ability to add new syntax rapidly[Moose, Devel::Declare etc], Automation, Testing culture, Documentation, Unix, Parsing, Getting things done real fast... I can go on.. but I will stop here), If you look at what Larry Wall has been saying over the years about Perl 6 in various talks you will note that he designed Perl to fill a niche which continues to be totally unoccupied till today's date. The only competitors Perl has in its design space are tools like sed and awk with a additional few Unix utilities thrown around. In other words Perl doesn't have any credible competition. What's more? Any language that is designed to replace Perl will largely look like Perl(Read: Ruby, Perl 6). And yes, Php and Ruby do have their niches.<p>Python doesn't have a niche. All Python has is- ""Tab indent your code."" And sorry to break the bad news to you. Merely forcing indentation on a bad programmer doesn't magically transform him to a good programmer. Rather it make the situation more worse. It gives him a free pass to sit amidst good programmers.",1361077237

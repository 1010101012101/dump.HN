At the moment, anyone who doesn&#x27;t vote generally falls into one of two categories:<p>1) I don&#x27;t care<p>2) I don&#x27;t want any of them<p>Having some way of explicitly saying &quot;I care, but have no confidence in <i>any</i> of you&quot; can be quite powerful. If it wasn&#x27;t, votes of no confidence wouldn&#x27;t mean anything.<p>>  Saying on record &#x27;i want reform&#x27;, or &#x27;i don&#x27;t like the old system&#x27; does not achieve anything<p>Only when people agree that the old system has problems. If all the parties think it&#x27;s fine and they think their constituents are happy with it then a significant voice saying &quot;No, we&#x27;re not&quot; is important, even when there&#x27;s no plan. If people agree that there are issues then yes, it&#x27;s pointless.<p>You don&#x27;t need to form a party for this however, you can spoil your ballot paper, that has to be counted.<p>Unfortunately, due to misinformation (IMO) the plan to reform the voting system failed.

I think the real issue is that the money has to come from somewhere --- specifically, the money would necessarily come from the high earners in society. And they would have to agree to basic income since in our current form of democracy the high-earners have a disproportionate influence on the law.<p>Money doesn&#x27;t come only from taxes, it can also come from printing. However, relying on printing money to cover government expenses has been a bad idea pretty much everywhere (there are a lot of examples of hyperinflation, like Zimbabwe, Argentina and Germany).

What struck me how much more verbose was the AI and human talking to it. Humans between themselves used such shorthands that made the conversation almost unintelligible to me just because I&#x27;m not american or even native english speaker.<p>What useful AI systems up to date lack is the right internal representation. Current interaction between real world and AI systems resemble interaction between an application components and unit testing mockups.

This means that everyone now has enough money for food, rent and other basic necessities. That means that the demand for these goods will increase (maybe not much in the US, but significantly in other parts of the world). That means that the prices for those goods will increase (unless production increases somehow, but why would it?). To adjust for this, the government would have to increase the income; then the prices would increase again and so on. Basically you&#x27;d have rampant inflation.<p>Now the counterargument is going to be that this wouldn&#x27;t happen, because production would increase up to a point where everyone&#x27;s needs are met, and prices stabilize. However, production still depends on labor. What incentives would people have to put in more work to produce more?",1376818602

Once you have enough people being able to sell services to others, infrastructure should come automatically - probably roughly in the order of maslow&#x27;s pyramid.

Stop it!&quot; is a questionable sign. &quot;Homeless organizations&quot; are not all alike; they have radically different approaches. (For example, to what extent are they led by homeless people affected by their actions?)<p>Your post maintains that people should hit rock-bottom; then they will be integrated into government programs to <i>&quot;work themselves back into society in general&quot;</i> with <i>&quot;strict oversight and supervision&quot;</i>. And, <i>&quot;They need to bottom out and seek help of their own free will.&quot;</i> This notion of &quot;free will&quot; is actually &quot;desperation&quot;. It is not a free choice between alternatives.<p>Consider this: have you spoken with a parent who complained about some random rude person who criticized some minor aspect of their childcare? (Usually a mother, since even rather negligent fathers are heroes.) That can ruin people&#x27;s days, make them angry and humiliated. Consider being in an institution which is all about this &quot;strict oversight and supervision&quot;. And what&#x27;s the prospect? Many uninterrupted hours a day of even more dignity destruction washing dishes for some strict boss. (Who often stiffs them on their paycheck to boot.)<p>(I&#x27;m not saying people have to individually give money to their fellow humans down on their luck. If people prefer some small sustainable amount of activism to fight the societal structures which make people poor, good on them. That&#x27;s collective action, not atomized individual action; certainly in the business world, people organize into strange sorts of collectives. And activism is generally in their own interests; the prospect of being poor scares people into accepting worse conditions for being cogs in the machine. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/27/business/job-insecurity-of-workers-is-a-big-factor-in-fed-policy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/27/business/job-insecurity-of...</a>)",1376817593

6232163,comment,6231240,6231240,3,0,catnaroek,,,"To a certain extent, the analogy is fair:<p>Go&#x27;s design is much simpler (in the sense of &quot;bare bones&quot;) than Rust&#x27;s, just like C&#x27;s design is much simpler than C++&#x27;s. But this comes at the price of leaving many common, repetitive development tasks as &quot;exercises to the [reader] programmer&quot;, such as resource management. Now, I am aware that memory, being plentiful these days, can be managed using a garbage collector. But, for any resource not called memory, you are on your own. Also, Go&#x27;s shared memory model, while flexible by default, is also quite messy by default. Managing the mess is, again, left as an exercise to the programmer.<p>Rust&#x27;s design is much closer to the C++ philosophy that the language must do as much as possible for the programmer. But what sets Rust apart from all the other wannabe C++ replacements is that Rust also incorporates the idea (taken from the Haskell/ML world) that one of the most useful things a language can do for the programmer is provide tools for ruling out huge classes of bugs. Thus you get a strong type system that provides support for parametric polymorphism (generics), ad-hoc polymorphism (traits), guaranteed-correct resource management (the pointer system) and mutability control.<p>Finally, I would like to improve on your analogy: Go is to C/Python as Rust is to C++/Haskell. Go is for the hacker type who wants to write his program as a sequence of instructions and call it a day. Rust is for a more refined type of programmer, the kind that is aware that his brain alone is not powerful enough to reason about the correctness of a big program, and thus prefers to use tools to automate reasoning about the boring repetitive parts, freeing his brain for reasoning about the actually hard parts of his program.",1376817374

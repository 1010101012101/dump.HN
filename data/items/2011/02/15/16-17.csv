2222013,comment,2220940,2221518,0,0,wccrawford,,,"Everyone makes mistakes, but they should never be encouraged.  Beginners should be encouraged to explore, though.<p>I disagree about fear being only of something being taken away.  I don't fear for my job because I know I am good enough.<p>Instead, I fear what repercussions my mistakes will have on others, such as the company I work for.  I suppose you could argue that it's still somehow something being taken away, but it's much less tangible and I can't put it into words if that's so.<p>I also worry that I'll spend more time and effort on something than it deserves.  It's rather a silly worry, but it does keep me efficient at my job, so it turns out to be useful after all.  (Unlike my fear of heights and water which haven't helped me at all so far.)<p>I agree that third-hand ""That's bad!"" is often misleading, but I think those things are great for beginners.  It lets them avoid the most troublesome mistakes while they learn.  After they learn the basics, they can start breaking those rules.  Art is much the same way.",1297789172

Timex recently discontinued the Datalink and they're already becoming very hard to find.  I hoping some company would come up with a suitable replacement but unfortunately nobody seems to build something with a comparable design.<p>The advantages of the Datalink are that it always shows the time (no button press necessary), the battery lasts an entire year, is water-resistant, and is small and subtle.  It also just makes a damn good watch without any of the programmable features.  Every other programmable watch available is anything but subtle, with a display that isn't active all the time, and has to be constantly recharged.  Those are considerable failings for a watch.<p>What the Datalink lacks is a denser display (but remaining as 1bit LCD is ok), any sort of wireless (ANT+ would be suitable), and sensors (pulse, altitude, position, etc).  It could also use, obviously, a faster processor with more RAM and storage (it also has 32k).<p>The price for this watch is fantastic but it's still just not quite what I'm looking for.",1297788880

There is a marked difference in quality as this is the only way suppliers can make money off sales to Wal-mart.  Of course, software follows very different rules of scale than textiles.  We may expect to see product differentiation such as ""MyApp for Android"" having more R&D into it than ""MyApp for iOS"".  Its hard to say how this differentiation will take place, its new territory.",1297787742

However, I don't see this as Mozy's fault. They provide you with online backup for free and all they ask is that you regularly check in to show that you're still using the service.<p>Providing services costs money, and it's entirely acceptable for the provider to terminate non-paying users' services at any time. Of course, it's much better if they do it after a while and with a warning (which Mozy apparently did do), but it's unfortunate that the email was lost.<p>In summary, I don't think people have much right to complain that the service they were getting for free wasn't provided in perpetuity as well.

This is because there is no feedback loop for colleges to evaluate when they are doing something wrong and thereby correct it. Without a loop in place, all the theorizing in the world isn't going to make a better college, just a prettier org chart.<p>I think there's a difference between saying something that's probably true and that we can probably agree with and actually observing the results to changes in an organization.

Given an upper bound on k, this is no worse than a trie.""</i><p>Let's make an even stronger assumption that every word in your set has length k.  You then need to store (k^2 + k)/2 characters per distinct word with the sorted set implementation (plus any additional data-structure overhead).  In a worst-case scenario, you have N of these k-length words, distinct at the first character (this might seem paranoid for something like ASCII, but think about Unicode here...or just change the problem to N distinct strings at character >=2), resulting in a worst-case memory bound of O(N * ((k^2 + k) / 2)).<p>That said, the possible range of N will be much larger than k for any non-trivial k, so I suppose it's fair to say that real-world memory use is something more like O(N) with a very high constant that's quadratically related to your average word length.  But that's still substantially worse than a well-implemented trie (where your constant is small and unrelated to k), and with large data sets every byte counts.<p><i>""Although the top 1000 recently searched items might not share as much structure, that is a trivial amount of data, even for O(N^2)....the storage overhead on a trie is high, especially as many bigrams don't occur in English, so array-based tries necessarily waste space.""</i><p>If your set size is only 1,000, then yeah, this conversation is academic.  I'm talking about big suggestion sets -- for a website, it's not too difficult to get into a situation where your suggestion set is in the hundreds of thousands or millions of strings or more.  Remember that web text is nothing like /usr/share/dict.  Proper nouns, acronyms, non-words, new words, foreign words, etc. all conspire to make real-world language much larger and more diverse than the system dictionary.  The size of real-world vocabularies is one of those counter-intuitive things that I wouldn't have guessed before working on websites.<p>Finally, while you definitely have to be careful when implementing a trie, there are improved trie algorithms (like burst tries), that greatly improve upon average- and worst-case memory usage.  A totally naïve trie implementation has a ton of overhead...but then, a naïve set implementation has a ton of overhead, too.  So it's important to not be naïve. ;-)<p>(related:  looks like the redis guys have been oddly resistant to adding tries, despite several requests:  <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/redis/issues/detail?id=110"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/redis/issues/detail?id=110</a>)",1297786008

2221666,comment,2221195,2221590,0,0,anonymoushn,,,"I understand what you're saying, and I'm not going to adapt the analogy to suit my view of the situation because that invariably becomes kind of silly.<p>I think that as long as Apple allows publishers to make content viewable inside the app store purchasable outside the app store <i>only</i>, this policy is fair and as you've described it.<p>If Apple requires publishers to make content viewable in the app store purchasable in the app store, the publisher is forced to choose between losing 30% of revenue on a chunk of their transactions or having a vastly inferior product for entirely artificial reasons.  Apple would essentially be holding the publisher's product quality ransom.<p>I'm also not a fan of this because I think that people who have costs forced on them for a specific subset of their transactions should be able to transparently pass on those costs to the customers who make those transactions, rather than spreading it out across all customers.  I think that publishers should be able to charge 43% more for purchases and state in the app that it costs more because Apple is taking a 30% cut.  I think that retailers should be able to charge 1-2% more to customers who use Visa and MasterCard than to those who use cash, and a couple percent more for Discover or AmEx.  Instead, the cost is concealed and the users who don't have CCs with excellent rewards programs are paying for the rewards programs of those who do.  With this policy, non-iDevice-users will pay a premium to allow iDevice users to buy the content more easily, and that doesn't strike me as particularly fair.",1297785844

The thinking (right or wrong) goes like this:<p>* Publishers don't want to use Apples payment system as it locks them into Apple<p>* Publishers don't want to use iTunes for managing subscriptions<p>* Publishers don't want to have to pay 30% of the costs to pay for a service they don't want to use<p>There is a great and strong argument that its good for users and I agree with that. Users don't have to enter billing info etc across multiple apps. Thats a win, and a big one too.<p>However the reality is that when people grumble about paying for news content in the first place, and newspapers turn to the internet as publishing market shrinks, and the whole business model of news is in flux, along comes Apple and says we're going to take 30% for adding a service that you (the publisher) don't want and we're going to great a barrier between you and your customer so you're dependent on us.<p>This could be a huge debate, and I honestly can't go into one. Too tired. Too much to do today. So let me just say that you should always do what the consumer wants and in this case Apple is providing that.<p>But by a 30% cut they're going to make it difficult for news organizations to budget and pay for in-depth news coverage as they become increasingly dependent on online revenue sources.",1297785782

I consider it too core to outsource and, ideally, pretty much every person in your small startup - their ideal customer [1] - should be involved in it.

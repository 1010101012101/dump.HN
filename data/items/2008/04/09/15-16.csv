Are any objects cachable?).<p>Also, how are you looking to measure the growth?  CPU ticks consumed per page load over time?  Server costs per month?  Bandwidth?  DB storage growth?

158878,comment,158087,158867,0,0,rbanffy,,,"Well... You know that all the major hard to do components of our little imaginary framework already exist: there already is a Lisp-based web server that could handle HTTP requests (we assume it would stand behind a cache such as Varnish) and there must be at least a good few RDBMS persistence mechanisms for Lisp by now. As for the template engine, I would tend to go for something like ZPT (Zope Page Templates) as mixing code in the presentation layer does not hit me as particularly fancy. AFAIK, there is no implementation in Lisp, so, it would have to be done. For the rest, the glue connecting the HTTP to the persisted objects, it would be rather easy to do patterning after Rails or Django.<p>So, I think if we decided to really do it, even without full dedication, we could have it ready for release in about a year.<p>And it would be cool to launch it on April 1st.",1207754612

And, one of the biggest pain points for a growing startup is scaling the database.<p>Enter App Engine.  Google has spent years developing Big Table and their underlying distributed OS, and they are probably years ahead of anybody else on this one.  Essentially what App Engine consists of is giving 10,000 developers read/write accounts to the worlds largest distributed database management system.<p>Now, it's up to the developers to add their HTML/CSS/Javascript GUI's and a little data crunching middle-ware all the world to use.",1207754512

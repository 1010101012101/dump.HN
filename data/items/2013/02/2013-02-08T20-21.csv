Justice is not about arriving at a decision quickly, but arriving at the correct decision.<p>> <i>Why can't we create have a hacker legal defense fund that would keep cases like this from bankrupting defendants?</i><p>Nobody says you can't, but I know I wouldn't put money into it. You don't get to do something like that and cherry pick who gets to use it. Criminals will use it to pay for a better attorney.<p>> <i>Why should expert legal advice be only available to those who can afford it?</i><p>Because expert legal minds are not content to earn $50,000 a year, and with what it costs to attend the best law schools (and even mediocre undergraduate institutions) it's ridiculous to expect them to.<p>> <i>What should we tell a friend who is planning to commit a crime on behalf of a cause?</i><p>That if they're not willing to pay the full price they probably shouldn't do it.<p>> <i>Was Aaron's cause worth anyone's life? This should be a question for everyone, not just prosecutors.</i><p>This is where I start to get twitchy with the general consensus on HN. Aaron was not murdered. His death was not an accident. He <i>chose</i> to take his own life, so clearly to him this cause was worth that, or at the very least it was preferable to him going to prison.<p>> <i>Is any middle ground possible in the conflict between rights holders and advocates of free information?</i><p>Not so long as rights holders are hell bent on perpetuating a business model from the 1920s, and not so long as free information activists are hell bent on not respecting the personal (intellectual) property rights of others, including corporations.",1360357174

5190027,comment,5189141,5189595,3,0,stcredzero,,,"So your point is that refactoring is so often done badly, that it's better off if everyone cut & pastes?<p>In one sense, this doesn't surprise me. I remember doing lots of ill-advised refactorings when I was younger. Refactoring is a nifty idea, and so it's easy to be enamored of it and eager to apply it like it's a new toy. I'm sure lots of people act this way with new power tools and often the resulting ""oops"" gets thrown in the scrap bin.<p>The problem with refactoring code, is that recognizing the ""oops"" is harder. Probably, the thing still runs and all the tests still pass. It requires putting yourself in the shoes of someone who hasn't seen the thing before. It's not like seeing that you gouged a sanded surface. It's more like realizing that the technique you were so fond of conflicts with the composition. Not only is it subtle, you often also have to be mature enough to swallow your pride.<p>That said, a properly done poor refactoring is still superior to copy & paste. Why? Because, done correctly, you can pretty much guarantee finding all the places you need to change. With cut & paste, in a large codebase, you need to do some inspired searching and second-guessing -- and this is where the major risk comes in when you <i>have to</i> change something. You're still going to need some of that in a large codebase, even when it's very DRY. The smart move is to minimize that as much as possible, because again, that is where the risk comes in.<p>Ultimately, refactoring and DRY should be thought of, at its core, as a <i>clerical tool</i>. You need to take steps to ensure that ideas don't get lost in the codebase -- those give rise to bugs. However, you should only take those steps when the downside risk of ideas getting lost definitely outweighs the risk of making a mistake and introducing bugs or decreasing code clarity and flexibility.",1360356367

The dilemma is that programmers have many, many roads to follow if they want to improve their product, all of them discrete, deep fields in their own. Math is great, and certainly studying it will expand your mind...but so will studying engineering practices, statistics (which yes, is a kind of math, but not as theoretical as the kind the OP is advocating for), user interface design, and knowledge domains (medicine, legal, earth sciences, etc.)...all of which, as far as most programmers can tell, will yield concrete rewards much more easily than will mastering higher level mathematics.",1360356342

We get ""researcher code"" that was used to write a paper, and turn it into something for the next set of researchers to build on. There are several other groups at this university that do the same thing.<p>I'm starting to think, there may be a field of study here. I regularly take software that ""proves"" some hypothesis or ""shows some good results"", tear it down, and throw some engineering at it, only to find that the results are not reproduced, or the benefits are severely diminished. Then I have to go track down the why... because until I can show it, it is assumed my fault.[1] The results of some of this are probably paper worthy themselves.<p>I think a useful field, or useful conference at least could be built for people in this typeof postions, studying the meta effects of software on research. How can we report the issues found, or the updates to the numbers, without putting black marks on the reputations of people who actually are doing good work?<p>Another interesting phenomenon that is worth study is that the refactoring/rewriting process often gets real results, but it turns out the mechanism for the improvement isn't what the original researcher thought/claimed. It is something perhaps related, perhaps a side effect, and so on. There needs to be a way to recognize both the original researcher, the programmer who found the issues, and the follow-up researchers who did some more determination of the problem.<p>[1] This isn't as antagonistic as it sounds. It is actually a nice check on my own mistakes. Did the differences in what the researcher did and what I did introduce some strange side effect? Did I remove a shortcut that wasn't actually a shortcut and I misunderstood? A hundred other things on both sides...

5189979,comment,5181949,5185531,1,0,csense,,,"Here's an explanation suitable for someone only familiar with high-level languages:<p>MOV x,y translates to the assignment operator ""x = y"" in a high level language [1].<p>Your program only has access to one giant array called ""memory"" [2] [3].  So MOV EAX,EBX means ""EAX = EBX"" in high-level terms; MOV EAX,[EBX] means ""EAX = memory[EBX]"" in high-level terms (""memory[EBX]"" has the same meaning here as in C-family languages like C, Java, Javascript and Python).  This choice of operator notation is intuitive, because it's very similar with the use of brackets in other popular languages.<p>The insane syntax uses parentheses instead of brackets.  Which is confusing, since it's <i>not</i> related to the standard meaning of parentheses, grouping for order of operations or function call.  So you would say ""MOV EAX,(EBX)"" in weird-syntax land.<p>But the insanity doesn't end there.<p>In the sane Intel syntax, if you want to load the value at memory location 148 + -4 + ESP into EBX, you can probably figure out how you would say it:<p><pre><code>  MOV EBX,[148 + -4 + ESP]
</code></pre>
The C/Java/JavaScript/Python translation is:<p><pre><code>  EBX = memory[148 + -4 + ESP]
</code></pre>
In weird-land, the syntax for this operation is:<p><pre><code>  MOVL BX,148 + -4 (SP)
</code></pre>
To me, it looks like this instruction says:<p><pre><code>  Let t = 148
  Let u = The contents of memory pointed to by SP
  Let v = -4*u
  Let BX = t+v
</code></pre>
Clearly, there are only two possible explanations for this:  The person who came up with this syntax was drunk at the time, or the person who came up with this syntax was high at the time.<p>[1] In a HLL, ""x = y"" allows arbitrarily long expressions for x and y, but in assembly language only a few different forms of x and y are allowed.  In a high-level language, in the expression ""x = y"", x needs to be an lvalue, while y can be a more general rvalue.  ""a = 5+6"" is legal; ""5+6 = a"" is not.  Both the left- and right-hand side can be arbitrarily long and complicated, for example the LHS could be ""a.b.c.d.e.f.g.h"" and the RHS could be ""m+n+o+p+q+r+s+t"", assuming the appropriate variables exist and have the appropriate types.<p>[2] Unless you use multiple segments.

Furthermore, the department offers a minor in psychology, but not in neuroscience.<p>And, for your edification, here is the online material for the course Cognitive Processes, which is one of MIT's definitive classes in cognitive psychology:<p><a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/brain-and-cognitive-sciences/9-65-cognitive-processes-spring-2004/lecture-notes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/brain-and-cognitive-sciences/9-65...</a><p>I took this class as an undergraduate, and it is a great class. The famous childhood development psychology professor, Susan Carey, taught this class when I took it.<p>Arguing with you seems fruitless: You just assert things that are patently false without bothering to do the most basic of research or even just listening to what has been said to you. You might even just consider the name of the department: ""cognitive"" refers to the mind, not the brain, and ""cognitive science"" is a synonym for ""cognitive psychology"". (Though when using the term ""cognitive science"", the study is a bit broader, adding in cross-disciplinary research from artificial intelligence and philosophy of mind. MIT is big on cross-disciplinary research.)<p>How do I know this? Well, I might have just spent a few minutes looking things it up before spouting off, but I also have a degree in cognitive science from MIT.<p><i>> Yes, and that is why the reliable core of tested psychological theory prevented the Recovered Memory Therapy fiasco of the 1990s, prevented Facilitated Communications from ever getting off the ground</i><p>There's no <i>one</i> psychology. Have you studied any history of science? Have you read Kuhn? Throughout all of the history of science there have been divisions in scientific fields and ""paradigm shifts"". As Kuhn pointed out, the old generation has to literally die off before the new paradigm in a field can become the new orthodoxy. Until that happens, many scientists in scientific fields will cling desperately to their already disproven theories. Just look at Einstein, for instance. Why didn't he win a Noble Prize for Relativity? Because there were many physicists who did not yet accept Relativity, even long past the point in time when it was irrefutable.<p>Enough time has not passed for cognitive psychology to become the orthodoxy of psychology, but some day it will be. Cognitive psychology is not going to be ""replaced"" by neuroscience, but it will be informed by it. And vice versa. The two fields have always informed each other.<p>Also, unfortunately, our understanding of the human mind scientifically is not yet strong enough to offer a whole lot to clinical psychologists, so the establishment of cognitive psychology as the new orthodoxy through all of psychology will no doubt be delayed by the needs of clinical psychologists to do their jobs, rather than just telling people with mental illness to go home and chill for the next 50 years, until we understand the human mind and human brain better.<p>As for ""explanation"", you completely ignored what I said. If you continue this, there's little point in having a discussion with you. There's no discussion if someone just talks and does not listen. I'll repeat this one more time, however: Physics has not <i>explained</i> why conservation of energy is true. It merely has noted this fact, and has asserted that it is the case based on empirical induction.<p>Other things, of course, are explained in terms of conservation of energy, but conservation of energy has not been explained. The same thing was true for Behaviorism. It didn't explain why the mind was putatively nothing but a large collection of simple learned responses to external stimuli. That was its main premise, which was a hypothesis based on scientific observation, etc. But Behaviorism certainly <i>attempted</i> to explain all the rest of psychology in terms of this premise. And it's a universal principle of rational thought, that once you have identified laws and/or principals, you can use these laws and principles to explain other things, even if you have no explanation for the laws themselves.<p>In any case, Behaviorism's problem was that their model was wrong, and so the explanations failed to pan out, except in certain constrained situations, like training animals. Of course now we know that even those explanations are over-simplified, but they are explanations, nonetheless. In any non-fundamental science, however, comprehensible explanations are likely to be over-simplified. The human mind can only grasp so much complexity and many natural phenomena are hugely complex.",1360355529

To have a really usable public transit network ala Chicago or New York, you have to coordinate zoning with transit.<p>1) The terminal transit station should be built so as to exit right into the central business district. The Caltrain station is too far from SOMA and lacks decent public transit. Meanwhile, Chicago's three transit stations exit right at the perimeter of the Loop (within walking distance of nearly any office building, and with a transit ring around the perimeter of the CBD). New York's two transit stations exit right into Midtown.<p>2) You have to allow high-density construction near the transit stations, so people can live within walking distance of commuter transit. Look at the Menlo Park Caltrain station. There's nothing around it. There are far smaller Westchester towns that have a substantial downtown core around their Metro North stations.<p>With housing prices being what they are in Silicon Valley, there should be 30+ story buildings ringing the Caltrain stations in Menlo Park, Palo Alto, Mountain View, etc.",1360354712

I think the companies of Silicon Valley are very interested in improving public transportation, but held back by an ineffective transit governance system. I think the comparison to the gold rush is ridiculous, as is the statement that ""technology is just another boom"" (what?). I think being a technology hub has done more to improve the lives of everyone in the Bay Area than any other human-controlled factor, but authors like this one are too concerned with irrelevant impressions and skin-deep, false comparisons to consider that.",1360353819

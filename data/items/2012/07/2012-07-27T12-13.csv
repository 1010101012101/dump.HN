It reads like ""we didn't think of this free online disruptive academy first"" or ""how dare you do something differently from and outside of Official Academia.""<p>Do you know who the <i>best</i> teachers are? I mean the absolute best, the ones who actually <i>get</i> what the student is struggling with? Other students-- the ones who <i>just</i> got through that particular lesson, the ones that <i>just</i> had the exact same struggle. The students' ability to teach like this declines with experience with the material because it all starts to become second-hand and they forget all the little things they struggled with early on. When an instructor takes note of students teaching students and the hows and whys of that interaction and remembers to cover the same territory in the next class, he becomes the best non-student teacher he can.<p>My mother is my perfect anecdotal example of this. In her 50s, she's getting a degree. While taking calculus, she also worked in the tutoring lab. After understanding new material, she'd be an absolute godsend for students for about two weeks and then her helpfulness would fall off. (You could also attribute this to all these classes being mostly in sync with at most two weeks of lag - that being the case, she would be less exposed to the reteaching of the material ... and forget those little details.)",1343393530

4301054,comment,4300977,4300977,1,0,drostie,,,"I think you need to be a little more careful with the word ""product"". I first learned that it has a little extra jargon above-and-beyond coding when I read a Joel on Software article about the ""Developer Abstraction Layer."" I won't link it because it's sort of a one-off comment (actually three or four one-off comments):<p>""Both of these companies can easily be wiped out by a company that's driven by programmers and organized to put programmers in the driver's seat, but which have an excellent abstraction that does all the hard work to convert code into products below the decks.""<p>Notice the emphasis on the difference between the code and how it is packaged into a whole experience. The ""product"" is not just something which developers contribute to in Joel's world, but something which lots of people are involved in.<p>I try to tell people about the truly mad ideas, as I see them, in science. One of them occurs in electronics and nuclear chain reactions and biological evolution: it's the idea of ""feedback"". Here's the nuclear version: you've got all of these nuclei which are too heavy, they ""want"" to fall apart, they just need a little disturbance. (It helps to think of mousetraps: they're in a metastable state and they just need a good jostle to collapse to a new equilibrium, releasing a bunch of energy.) This disturbance usually has to come from a free neutron which smacks into the nucleus. Nuclei are small, and so you might think this is excessively unlikely, and that there would be complex probability arguments involved in understanding the procedure. Actually, it's much more simple.<p>To get a chain reaction, the neutrons formed by one fissioning nucleus need to cause other nuclei to fission. If each fission creates, on average, even a little more than one other fission, then you have positive feedback, and an exponential growth -- unbounded energy. If each fission creates on average less than one, then you will have exponential die-off of any reaction, with finite energy. (The ""special case"" of exactly one is what you need to simulate if you want to create a stable nuclear reactor; you need another feedback system sitting on top of your existing one which lowers the expected value if it gets too high, or raises it as it gets low.) The same principle viewed different ways is evolution by natural selection (the genes which characterize the population are precisely those which cause themselves to be more likely), or the psychology of neurosis (paranoia is defined by the fact that it causes those you love to fail you, thus feeding the paranoia). In the language of probability, if N is the number of events caused immediately by one event, you need E(N) > 1.  That's the entire mathematics for positive feedback.<p>The reason that you want to focus on product is, I think, because you are struggling and struggling to get this value as high as possible. You need the expected value of converts, given one convert, to get greater than one. If you can do that, then <i>traction builds automatically</i>, as people who hear about it contact others to join further. In the long run, the people with the best product have the exponential advantage.<p>This is not to invalidate the problem-in-the-street of ""how do I survive the times when E(N) < 1?"". I am often reminded of the Chinese formulation of Buddhism, where you have an abstract goal (realize that all things are empty), but a concrete goal (there is a lot of meaning here and now), and you must form a synthesis of these two opposites. Your long-run abstract goal is certainly ""chain reaction""; your short-run concrete goal is simply to stay afloat.",1343392667

But it's expensive in a fairly symmetric way. It's in the interest of both parties to stop the process if there isn't mutual interest.<p>Both the company and the candidate will spend a lot of time in interviews, so it's in everyone's best interests to make sure that time isn't wasted if there no (or almost no) chance of the person being hired / accepting a job.<p>There might be earlier steps in the process, but those are also symmetric. It'll take a few minutes of your time to send a resume to a company, but somebody there will be tossing away 80% of them after reading through them once. There might be a phone screen or two in advance, to decide whether there's any point in having someone come in for an interview, but that is likewise costly to both parties.<p>But a programming test as the very first step of an interview is totally different. Now the costs are asymmetric. The company has an up-front cost (potentially substantial) but spends little time on each candidate. The candidate spends the time up-front, and only later finds out  whether the company is at all interested.<p>The candidate isn't invested in the process yet. So why would he spend an hour, when he has no idea of whether the company is interested? Maybe it's a really fun problem to solve. Or maybe he really, really wants to work at that particular company. Or maybe he is indeed unemployed like you suggested.<p>But someone currently employed is likely to have a different priorities from a student or someone who is unemployed, even if they are actively looking for a new job.

4301037,comment,4299556,4300773,2,0,hythloday,,,"I'll expand a little, because I've been feeling the same thing recently.<p>Python has syntactic support for list[0] comprehensions, which can be used a little like maps:<p><pre><code>  def addOne(n):
    return n+1

  l = [1, 2, 3]
  [ addOne(n) for n in l ] # [2, 3, 4]
</code></pre>
a little like filters:<p><pre><code>  def isOdd(n):
    return n % 2 == 1

  l = [1, 2, 3]
  [ n for n in l if isOdd(n) ] # [1, 3]
</code></pre>
and a little like folds/reductions:<p><pre><code>  def accum(s):
    acc = s
    def a(n):
      acc += a
      return acc
    return a

  l = [1, 2, 3]
  reduce = accum(0)
  [ reduce (n) for n in l ][-1] # 6
</code></pre>
You can also do Cartesian joins, though I rarely see these.<p>There are a couple of problems I've run into. The first is that Python's libraries are just not engineered with the idea of using list comprehensions in this way - folding is as awkward as it looks above, exceptions thrown in the list comprehension functions will terminate the comprehension, many python functions alter state and return None rather than a useful output, and so on. The second is that they're amazingly uncomposable, syntactically:<p><pre><code>   l.map(addOne).filter(isOdd).reduce(accum(0))
</code></pre>
is what I'd write in Scala, which is extremely tractable. In comparison, here's the equivalent in python:<p><pre><code>  [ reduce(nr) for nr in [ nf for nf in [ addOne(nm) for nm in l ] if isOdd(nf) ] ][-1]
</code></pre>
You note that I've had to rename the elements, because they ""leak"" to their surrounding comprehension - this can be quite confusing the first time you see it. Also these are fairly trivial comprehensions, which call functions rather than evaluate expressions in-place - this is well-supported and very idiomatic, but makes comprehension composition much harder.<p>I find Python's comprehension style very <i>convenient</i>, and I'm sure you <i>could</i> produce an excellent theoretical abstraction over it, but if you're coming at it from the point of view of wanting them to be map/reduce or something equally reasonable-about, you're going to be disappointed. Python isn't an object-oriented language, and isn't a functional language - the more I use it the more I think it's something akin to a collection-oriented language. Maybe that's just the way I use it. :)<p>[0] and also set comprehensions, dict comprehensions, and generator (lazy list) comprehensions, which are wonderful but exacerbate both the problems I talk about.",1343392465

To some extent you can use Scala and Clojure code from Java. But you can't really use Java code from Python or Ruby unless you work with Jython or JRuby.<p>So, I'd put Java in the ""dead end language"" bin.

If you come from a C++ background (like me) you might think the C++ solution will always be structurally superior.<p>But this is not true.  It has a really radical take on OOP, actually realizing some of the most extreme takes on OO from the C++ community: no class inheritance, only interface inheritance.  Using the inheritance syntax for non-interfaces (""classes"") does inheritance by composition.<p>Regarding templates: C++ has the best (imperative) language support for templates.

There's an obsession,  for instance,  about office suites that are so bad they make Microsoft Office look like a paragon of reliability and ease-of-use.<p>On the other hand,  there's been a complete disregard for the people who ~really~ use Linux such as sysadmins and developers.<p>I've recently set up two laptops that run Windows as a host and Ubuntu linux inside Virtualbox.  I use ""putty"" as my *term program and Cygwin/X to run the occasional GUI app I need from Linux.  It's a sign of what a disgrace the Linux desktop is that putty has the same ease-of-use and reliability that xterm had 15 years ago,  whereas the ""terminal"" program that Ubuntu tries to push on you is a bloated disaster in which cut-and-paste is as miserable as it was in Win 3.1.",1343391171

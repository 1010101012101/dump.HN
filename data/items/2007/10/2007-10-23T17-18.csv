Besides, the Amazon's idea is not about instant answers, so there are not many chances to get your answer(s) within an hour after asking.  And yes, I bet we can do it better.  Just because we're more simple and easy and intuitive.   More, speaking about Amazon's Turk, the price paid isn't relative to real world cost of living.  Most of the HITs over there are less then $1 per hour gigs.  We see our business in questions, which can be answered in 5 minutes or less, without need to perform long term investigation, review, discussion or anything time consuming.",1193161576

I was hoping that people would respond to this question by describing how they have done things in the past and what has worked for them and what hasn't.  I guess I probably should have worded it more towards that versus best practices.",1193161084

Also it'd bring a spirit of a challenge, and so you'll have to hurry up and use your chance to answer the question and get some money.

71686,comment,71608,71670,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"""So, again, Kant is quite useful in justifying just about anything.""<p>I don't see how you could conclude that. Your argument is that if the Nazis believed that they were doing the right thing, they'd believe that Kant would think they were doing the right thing, too. So you're only correct if you take their beliefs at face value, in which case I don't understand why you're complaining.",1193159571

71679,story,,,12,39,white,"YC: Please, criticize my startup!",,"Here is the deal - we're building an instant answer portal.  We're targeting to clients who need to get an instant multiple answers to their problem or a question (say, within 60 minutes time frame).  This will cost money (client's budget), that will be split over the subscribers, who will answer the questions.  One of the key points, that makes it interesting for market research groups, is that we'll be able to generate more then one answer for one question.  So here comes the major question - while it's pretty transparent and kind of motivating for subscribers, how do you think this is interesting for clients?  What target group of clients do you think we may be interesting for?  What kind of a questions do we sound like a great niche?  I have my own answers, but they're definitely not enough (one of the reasons why we're developing this portal :).  Just give me any feedback, either positive or negative.  Please, drop me a line if you see this either as a perspective startup or a looser.  THANKS!",1193158916

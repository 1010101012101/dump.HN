I guess the death of myself, my loved ones, my friends, and all 7 billion humans alive today isn't so bad compared to the sheer horror of <i>culture staying the same</i>.<p>Where's your perspective?<p><i>In short, we don't know what would happen, and it would be presumptuous to think that we do.</i><p>But it would be ridiculous to reject the idea of it based on speculation that it might not be possible.<p><i>Our plunder of the world's resources and our destruction of the environment</i><p>Rubbish, rubbish, rubbish. This self-flagellating viewpoint isn't winning points from a kindly jury. We can't ""destroy"" the environment or ""plunder"" the world's resource. All the stuff we've dug up is still in the universe, there is still <i>an environment</i>, and largely it's still the same as it ever was.<p>There was vastly more severe environmental change happening outside the time of humans than there has been during it, and we don't talk about the time the crust cooled and set as ""the great environmental destruction"", do we? Or when oxygen levels dropped, or when the earth warmed and ice ages finished? Or when plants appeared and took over the earth?<p>They were all enormous changes, yet today it's ""greenhouse gases and global warming, oh we're so sorry, we're really horrible, we deserve a punishment"".<p><i>may very well leave the planet unsuitable for human life.</i><p>Then we should probably fix that, not prostrate ourselves and play who's the most cynical and holier-than-thou games.<p><i>This is the idea that I was addressing in my first post, that of course the species does and should take precedent over the individual.</i><p>Of course it does? I refute that. We, the living humans on this planet, take precedence over all future, potential, hypothetical humans by virtue of <i>our existence</i> and their <i>non-existance</i>. Of course we do, any other view is ridiculous. Can you imagine ""women and children first"" changing to ""imaginary hypothetical people first, women and children second""? No.",1317935006

I have a feeling if the Milgram experiment were done in a military or corporate setting in which subjects weren't aware of participating in an experiment, the results would be very different. Hell, even if you took undergraduates and ""hired"" them to man the shock experiments for a professor who was grading them, you'd get different results.<p>Too bad experimenting on people without telling them is illegal.

On that day, he had already been going to night school for three years, and would continue for another four years before getting a degree in computer science (this was before the days of easy, short degree programs for adults with jobs). He wore a shirt and tie every day to his job but still looked like the kind of guy who wore coveralls to work.<p>He slumped.  His hair, thick glasses, and briefcase were dotted with rain.  He closed the apartment door, looked at me, and said, ""Never become an expert in something you don't like -- because then people will want you to do it ALL THE TIME.""<p>He was a lot happier after he got his degree, in part because I think there were more and better choices of things to become good at.

There is a saying in hindi called ""Lato keh bhoot bato sah nahi manti"" meaning... Ghosts who need a kick in the ass don't agree with words. I think you owe your investors to pursue every route to get the money back. Talk to your investors. They might be able to help on the legal front. Yes, it will take swallowing your pride and admitting you f<i></i>*ed up by bring this person into the deal but honesty will take you a long way with good people.<p>Advice 3) Decide on the right development plan from here to launch. I'm assuming you've got a business model that focuses on generating revenue not eye-balls. If not, quit now!<p>Your primary options seem to be a) develop yourself b) outsource to offshore c) outsource to students at nearby university.<p>From what you've mentioned so far, I wouldn't recommend developing it yourself. Learning the language is a good idea to know what a good job looks like.<p>Outsourcing to offshore is fine if you find a good team. A client of mine has had some serious problems with his India team. Proceed with caution. You need to be clear on deliverables and get constant ""back-ups"" of the code. This way you can tell if real work is being done... and have an early detection system of getting screwed.<p>There are university juniors who may be knowledgable enough to take your code and run with it. You may pay them or offer a equity  share. Students usually have expenses even if they are low. So expect to cover them. Also, use all your resources in rewarding them. It's obvious that you are personable and have interesting friends. Help your developers get connected. So regardless of whether your startup succeeds or not, your people will have a strong future.<p>The fourth unlisted option is to find a quality company who has a reputation for getting shit done and paying them a fair amount to get your product live. This will take money. And this could come from money recovered from your ex-partner.<p>Advice 4) Start selling. Yes, start selling before you have your product. If you have a purchase order for $10k, your investors will probably match it. You'll need to get creative.<p>Most of us, both developers and entrepreneurs, have been screwed at one point... or will be at some point in the future so I feel your pain.<p>Just remember: ""A diamond is just a hunk of coal made good under pressure."" ~ Rod Weckworth<p>I wish you the best.",1210215989

The original submitter's friend is thinking one of two things, alone or in combination:<p>1. ""If I take this useful app and add some social networking, it will help to market itself, which means it will sell more copies faster. Maybe it will even go viral and I can quit my day job!""<p>2. ""Given the choice between building an app that is useful but obscure and being visible and talked about, I'd rather be notorious.""<p>Point 1 is sometimes right, but often wrong. There are lots of tools that require a more traditional style of sales and marketing... and that have no use for tacked-on social networking features.<p>Point 2, while not exactly wrong, is a different objective than simply making money or improving people's lives.",1210215752

Not only is this shoddy reporting, but it commits a much worse crime.

No.  Wrong.<p>I've personally seen dozens of people go from being very overweight to being healthy and fit.  How'd they do it?

So you're good there.<p>You will have to supply a build of the GCC compiler that supports blocks, and make it play nicely with Xcode (provided you're talking about end-user apps to take advantage of libdispatch).  This shouldn't be too bad, but requires more Xcode-fu than the majority of Mac devs have.<p>The thing is, you should still use NSOperation for most multithreaded coding tasks in Snow Leopard, as it is now implemented using GCD underneath. You should only really monkey around with libdispatch calls directly if you're seeing performance problems with NSOperation (verified using profiling, of course).<p>I think the real benefit of this OSS project is going to be porting libdispatch to entirely different platforms (Linux, BSD, Windows, ...), and building NSOperation-like constructs in other languages/APIs to be used on many platforms (including the Mac, in the end).",1252676900

I've always liked what Alfred North Whitehead says about notation:<p>""By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work, a good notation sets it free to concentrate on more advanced problems, and, in effect, increases the mental power of the race. Before the introduction of the Arabic notation, multiplication was difficult, and the division even of integers called into play the highest mathematical faculties. Probably nothing in the modern world would have more astonished a Greek mathematician than to learn that ... a large proportion of the population of Western Europe could perform the operation of division for the largest numbers. This fact would have seemed to him a sheer impossibility ... Our modern power of easy reckoning with decimal fractions is the almost miraculous result of the gradual discovery of a perfect notation. [...] By the aid of symbolism, we can make transitions in reasoning almost mechanically, by the eye, which otherwise would call into play the higher faculties of the brain. [...] It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilisation advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them. Operations of thought are like cavalry charges in a battle -- they are strictly limited in number, they require fresh horses, and must only be made at decisive moments.""<p>--from An Introduction to Mathematics, 1911",1252676554

It's the same work Madonna does, and that's what she makes.""<p>Theoretically, what if you are exactly as good as a bank CEO? What if you sing and dance and compose exactly like Madonna?<p>Then do you deserve to be paid after the fact?<p>When an artist happens to make a piece of art that someone puts value on, what's wrong with the artist receiving money? Especially if the ""buyer"" were going to pay someone else instead (a shrewd middle man). Perhaps this money is supposed to be thought of as a donation?<p>Still, people want to own art. When an artist randomly makes art and then goes to a market to sell them, is that more like a comission? What about all the farmers and other folks at a market selling wares that weren't pre-comissioned? It's a natural exchange, though. Or maybe I'm brainwashed by culture.<p>Finally, why not just say that ""Artists should be compensated for good artwork""? Who cares if it is art or work or whatever. People should pay where they see value and do their best to pay smartly; eg, pay the artist so they produce more and are rewarded, and don't pay, eg the record labels more than their fair share (damn extortionists!). Technology seems to be helping in this area.<p>Sometimes work doesn't have a lot of value for other people. That's ok, too. It doesn't matter whether it is art or serious.

Sure, Buffett does often get better deals not available to retail investors, such as the recent Goldman deal, but Buffett also buys plenty of common stock as well.  (There is plenty of overlap in the philosophies as well...looking over his 2008 letter, seems like he favors dividend paying stocks, but don't hold me to that).",1252674234

I.e, if you put a guy in a desert with an oil field, the GDP per capita is huge. If you have a very productive place that is productive because of the high population, you have a low GDP per capita.<p>People go where the money is. The more people arrive, the lower the GDP per capita sinks. In the end, the only places with high GDP per capita are mines and oil fields, etc.",1252674140

You always think they'll happen to ""other companies"" and not yours.<p>An ERP, in order to be effective, takes a lot of buy-in from all your business units, and getting that buy-in will cost the IT people some serious office political capital if the install fails. So what does the average person in a large corporation go with? The big guys who have a proven record.<p>It's similar to the aphorism ""no one's ever been fired for picking [IBM, Microsoft, FedEx]"" - sure, there's a risk that the thing might fail, but when you go with the largest company around who is almost exclusively focused on this, that risk should go down (I'm not saying that's true - only that that's the working thought process), and even if it does fail, you can fall back on saying ""well, it's the industry standard, so I didn't screw up by picking it.""<p>Start-up ERP will not go straight into large companies, and it probably shouldn't. Start with small local companies, and slowly work up in size - and then pick a size and stop there. And look at FreshBooks: they're a Toronto start-up that's got some decent penetration into tracking and invoicing sector, which is traditionally the domain of much larger companies. They do that for a while, get small-to-medium sized businesses comfortable with them, and then in two years maybe release a module that does payroll and integrates into the existing one? A year after, once their customers trust both of those, release an HR one? There's your start-up ERP right there...",1252674092

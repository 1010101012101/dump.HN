Let&#x27;s go on a small tangent here.<p>Do you know why secret voting is considered important for democracy? In fact, it&#x27;s seen as a good feature of a voting system if a voter cannot prove to a third party that they voted a certain way, even if they really want to.<p>The reason is that democracy works best if your vote is a free expression of your political views, and can&#x27;t be easily influenced by money or threats. If you have the option of proving your vote to a third party, then the third party can bribe or extort you. If you don&#x27;t, they can&#x27;t. (Of course there are more complicated vote buying schemes, but it&#x27;s worth having some safeguards against the simplest one, at least.)<p>Note that we don&#x27;t just have laws that stop the government from buying people&#x27;s votes, because the government is not the only actor that can buy people&#x27;s votes. We also want to stop third parties from doing completely legal things that add up to vote buying or vote extortion.<p>As you can see, the issue isn&#x27;t really about privacy. The issue is that people should be free to support the political movements they like, and not be punished for it. If you make it harder for people to support the political movements they like, even if your actions are completely legal, you&#x27;ll get fewer people supporting the movements they like, and more people supporting the movements that others tell them to support. In other words, you get less democracy and more mob rule, or &quot;rule by social pressure&quot; if you prefer. I&#x27;m not saying that &quot;rule by social pressure&quot; is a bad system, it might even be better than democracy in some ways, but you have to be honest with yourself if that&#x27;s what you really support.<p>And that&#x27;s why I think attacking Eich for his donation is wrong.",1396442615

However, it&#x27;s also clear that svn is a hugely important project, not just for legacy reasons but also to provide certain benefits (mostly around simplicity and control) that many organizations need.  But SVN itself has none of those needs, it&#x27;s an open source project of the nature for which git was specifically designed.  So I&#x27;d think any rational developer would say it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable for SVN development to use git.

The HN ""showdead"" feature allows the banned comments to be seen, but relatively few people (I assume) use that feature.<p>One good way for community members to learn what is or isn't acceptable is by example.<p>Approaches like disemvoweling (and like HN's graying of down-voted comments) have the advantage that the offending post is still available as an example to other members of the community, quite clearly saying ""don't be like this"".<p>Another distinction is that disemvoweling is an action taken against comments, not users. Ideally, a user's first offensive post is disemvoweled, but they're allowed to come back and make a second attempt at civil conversation.<p>Of course, you still need a way to deal with the persistent offenders who refuse to learn from their experiences. For them, banning of whatever flavor seems perfectly reasonable to me.<p>On <a href=""http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/</a>, where I've seen the most use of disemvoweling (and several discussions of it and other techniques for defending community and rational conversation), disemvoweling of a comment is often followed by a moderator's brief explanation to fellow community members what about the comment was objectionable.

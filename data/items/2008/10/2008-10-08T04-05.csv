326337,comment,325161,325416,0,0,bbgm,,,"No it won't but if you don't know what an integer is, how are you going to program simple math?  You have to understand the basics.  Programming is implementation, and of course, must be taught well to be mastered, but it becomes a whole lot easier if you understand what you're trying to program.  It's not the best analogy in the world, but hopefully makes some sense",1223440657

It's impossible to tell how much of their overall traffic is music videos, because unlike the rest of their content, those tend to get replayed over and over, which messes up the counting. That's a lot of why music videos are all near the top all-time. (YouTube does do some stuff to not recount, so it's not 1:1, but it's clearly happening a lot.)",1223439604
326332,comment,326129,326261,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"When Google bought YouTube, they paid the big content makers money specifically for the right to show those videos. Now most music videos there are uploaded legally by the content producers.<p>There would certainly be copyright issues if not for deals in place.",1223439403

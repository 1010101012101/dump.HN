6271916,comment,6271292,6271667,5,0,reginaldjcooper,,,"If you want to see &quot;good&quot; targeted ads, go to Amazon. They have a vested interest in having you return again, so they put effort into finding a product that you will actually enjoy.<p>I highly doubt the average advertiser online cares if you return or not after the initial purchase. Their motivation is not to match you with something you want or will even like, but with something you will buy. It is therefore in their interests to use the targeting information to craft as manipulative an ad as possible for something your demographic can be tricked into purchasing.<p>That&#x27;s why, when ABP fails, I always see half-naked swordswomen advertising yet another click-and-wait castle building &quot;game&quot;. It&#x27;s definitely not something that I would enjoy; it&#x27;s a slot machine with virtual payouts that costs real money. If I payed $10 into it, would I be happy with myself the week after? Compared to e.g., a novel I might like, spend as much time on, but have a decent memory or experience that adds to my life.<p>If I thought advertisers would use my information to find me things that are useful or actually a good experience, I&#x27;d be more receptive to it. I&#x27;d still refuse because I hate all this data collecting stuff, and there&#x27;s no way to get your information back out, but I would feel like it was an okay deal for people that opted into it.",1377435538

There was, by mid-July, an explicit threat that the government would, after all, seek to stop the Guardian&#x27;s work and prevent publication of further material by legal means. To have resisted such action would have involved handing over ultimate control of the material to a judge and could have meant that no stories could have been published for many months, if at all. The first amendment of the American constitution guarantees its press protections of which British editors can only dream. For more than 40 years  since the publication of the so-called Pentagon papers in 1971  it has been accepted that the state will not succeed in trying to obtain prior restraint of the press. So we will in future report this story from New York. We have shared some material with, and will collaborate with, the New York Times.&quot;<p>So that was the reason why the Guardian moved the reporting on the story out of the UK.",1377435441

Is a course/certificate a reasonable option and can you recommend any in particular?<p>I know this might be a bit more of a &quot;career programer&quot; question than what&#x27;s normal for HN, but I still thought it would be worthwhile to ask.<p>I&#x27;ve been working with C++ for about 1.5 years now and find my growth stagnating. During normal work hours I find myself solving the problem at hand and moving on to the next problem rather than allocating enough time for deep learning and really gaining an understanding of C++ internals. This is mostly since there&#x27;s always more to do than we have time for.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about how to solve this and started thinking about taking a course/certification (probably in my spare time) that would allow me code in a more learning oriented way, while also forcing me to code in my spare time. (I read a lot of about programing and technology in my spare time but find most of my own projects fizzling out due to lack of motivation)<p>Do you think a course/certification is the right way to go? And if so can you recommend something worth taking?",1377435182

Doing website support for small businesses in medium and small markets often does work that way.   They have a site, they would prefer that things are added to it, instead of a complete replacement.  Back when I was doing webapps in this situation, the business would often insist on running the site from their T1 or ISDN line, refusing to spring for hosting someplace where they can&#x27;t see the physical hardware to reassure themselves that there is something there.<p>&quot;You want to back up the database for testing?   No, just connect to the production database.&quot;<p>&quot;No, you don&#x27;t have access to webserver config; just build it in a folder.&quot; (It turns out that <i>they</i> don&#x27;t have such access, either, since they &quot;had a disagreement&quot; with the guy who set up the box for them before he left on bad terms.  Asking about how to contact this guy is apparently suspicious).<p>&quot;You want us to sign a contract?  We&#x27;ll look at it.&quot;  (They never get back to you, since they can find a dozen other people who are grateful for the promise of payment).<p>&quot;Pay before it launches?  Oh, no, we pay net 60, but our site says &#x27;New site coming Oct 1st!&#x27;, so unless it&#x27;s up then, there&#x27;s no reason for us to pay you.&quot;  (Of course, they put this up without consulting you after you agreed to start prototyping).<p>And this is to say nothing of the people who insist on detailed designs and specification documents, then say, &quot;Actually, we&#x27;re going to wait a little while&quot;, and then you find your designed system on their site creaking along like it was written by the nephew of the boss&#x27;s secretary, who totally learned computer science stuff in high school this semester.  Surprise!   It <i>was</i> written by that guy, except they hired someone else at $15/hr to randomly change things until it worked, since he had to go back to school when spring break ended...<p>It&#x27;s not that there are a few businesses that operate like this: this seems to be the majority of small-town businesses who need webapps.  When I ran a business doing webapps and web design in the mid-2000s, I&#x27;m not sure I ever ran into an end customer who didn&#x27;t try to pull something I found really shady, though for them it was just the normal way they think they have to deal with vendors so that they can stay in business.<p>When I gave up and got a salaried job in 2008, my stress evaporated, even though it was a job at a failing startup.  :)",1377434804

Why not try to reach out to the artist and ask permission first?<p>Now before you hit the downvote icon, here&#x27;s a thought exercise: What do you think HN&#x27;s reaction would be if a random musician used this web visualization in a music video without asking permission first?

Although the blog entry has educational value, the music itself serves no purpose other than to provide a soundtrack. It&#x27;s being used for entertainment value, and if the developer does professional web design and references this work on a resume or contract offerings, then it arguably serves a commercial marketing purpose as well.<p>And saying that the video is available elsewhere? That&#x27;s again no different than appropriating images or artwork from elsewhere on the web and reusing them for other purposes.<p>It&#x27;s good that he credited the music, and I&#x27;m glad he thought about reuse issues.

As a freelancer or business your reputation is paramount - that reputation should be for professionalism and courtesy, even when others are not professional with you. This sort of incident teaches us the value of contracts, staged payments, and trust with your clients. If you don&#x27;t have a good trusting relationship with clients, it&#x27;s best to end that relationship and find other clients. If a client screws you, I think the best response is to make sure people know what they did, and adjust your process so that future clients can&#x27;t do that, not abuse your power over their domain/server to post a partisan message like this.<p>So I&#x27;m afraid your assumptions about my motivations are completely unfounded - perhaps you&#x27;d like to rethink them and offer me an apology?",1377432911
6271808,comment,6263205,6264862,2,0,wisty,,,"> People are already starting to grumble many of the same criticisms of Tim Cook&#x27;s innovation that they did about Steve Ballmer, and who can blame them? Over the past three years all Apple has shipped are the same products they had before but with different screen sizes.<p>I think the big difference is, Cook doesn&#x27;t seem to be pushing innovative people out. The only big head to roll under Cook&#x27;s watch was Scott Forstall&#x27;s, and apparently he left because he clashed with Jonny Ive (and wanted to go to war with Google in the machine learning space - not just having a few in-house alternatives, but trying to lock Google out of the iPhone to promote Apple&#x27;s stuff).",1377432908

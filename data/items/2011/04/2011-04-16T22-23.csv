I've thought for a while that the way we teach maths is broken - not because we use too much rote or muscle memory, but because we separate teaching from practicing. We spend an hour learning a concept, and only practice using it when we get home. We spend six weeks teaching the basics of differentiation, and then move on to integration. While we do integration, we totally forget how to differentiate.<p>The article mentioned  that memory retention is an exponential curve. Science has also shown that the best time to practice a concept is right before we would forget it. Put together, these two principles allow us to devise revision plans that make learning efficient.<p>Why are we stuck in the 18th century?

2455044,comment,2453873,2454752,0,0,baddox,,,"Not true. Determinism does not imply predictability where predictability means ""able to be computed faster than just waiting for the algorithm to play out."" When the whole universe is performing a computation, even if it's deterministic, there's no way to ""predict"" in the sense of knowing a future event before it takes place. Any other definition of ""predictable"" doesn't make sense.<p>An additional (and perhaps stronger) argument is that Rice's theorem states that you cannot in general predict the behavior of deterministic computation. You can't know if a program will ever access the network card, output a letter ""A,"" halt, etc. even though all of these programs are known to be deterministic.<p>I don't think anyone is saying that we can create a cellular automata (or any computer) capable of simulating the entire universe. That doesn't mean that the universe can't be modeled as one. You can't simulate an Intel i5 CPU in realtime in Windows 7 running on an Intel i5, but that doesn't mean an i5 isn't deterministic.<p>As a side node, the potential richness and unpredictability of deterministic computations is a major theme of many works by Rudy Rucker. Any investigation of cellular automata will reveal the unpredictability of deterministic computation, which is essentially the whole point behind cellular automata.",1302993551

2455015,comment,2454725,2454917,9,0,JoshTriplett,,,"Don't play as adversaries, then.  The original article suggests a simplified role-playing game, where the adult effectively just implements the game mechanics and acts as a GM.  You don't have to structure it like an RPG, but any game with meaningful choices that remains balanced will have a similar structure: the adult implementing a game for the kid.  That's not ""throwing the game"", that's redefining the idea of the game.<p>Consider that the job of a GM isn't to beat the players by any means possible, but to make a fun game with the right level of challenge.  In an adversarial situation you'd call that ""throwing the game"".  But in a game where the GM simply implements the game mechanics, they just act as an infinitely flexible interpreter of desired actions and generator of sensible results.  In other words, you've implemented a single-player game for the kid(s).<p>That said, I do think ""games"" like Candyland have a place; they're just really uninteresting as games.  They do something interesting and allow interaction.  So do toys that light up or make noise when you interact with them.  Candyland demonstrates a structured form of interaction, and a concept of game rules (moving your token according to defined rules rather than just marching it across the board as you please).  Calling it a ""game"" is a stretch, but that doesn't make it worthless.",1302992691

Not because everyone happens to speak the same language -- though such easy transit encourages people to want to learn a common language.<p>So since we have lots of institutions that are functioning well and durable, they provide incentives to newcomers to interact with them in mutually beneficial ways.<p>Contrast this with mexico which has been destabilized by US drug policy which enriches the criminal gangs who produce drugs and profit from high black market prices. In that setting, the main ""institutions"" are criminal gangs and corrupt cops.  There's not much incentive to undertake legal agriculture, so few try.  There is not much incentive to build structures that would be toppled by the gangs and corruption.<p>So without getting too long winded, I'm arguing that institutions are an emergent property of geopolitical factors, and that the US has many strong institutions that would benefit from improved economies of scale if more people participated.... even if those people started out at the low end of the socioeconomic spectrum.",1302992447

It's gotten to the point of being repetitive and boring.<p>I feel exactly the same way about iOS vs Android.<p>Ultimately, Google is a search and advertising company. From our (disclaimer: I work for Google but have nothing to do with Android) perspective, I believe Android is a stellar success as the more people use the Internet, the more money we make. Android has successfully (IMHO) commoditized the smartphone OS, which is good for everyone who isn't a mobile OS maker.<p>Apple is a consumer hardware company and a stunningly successful one at that. Android is a means to an end for Google just as iOS is a means to an end for Apple.<p>So all these ""analyses""/opinions basically miss the point because Apple and Google are playing two different games.<p>What's more, I find Apple coverage to be incredibly shortsighted. Like when the Xoom came out in January and the usual suspects went on about how much better it was than the iPad, missing two key points:<p>1. Consumers don't compare bullet lists of tech specs; and<p>2. Apple's successor (the iPad 2) was only 1-2 months out. Both competitors and commenters are constantly chasing Apple's last year's product, seemingly ignorant than Apple is a constantly moving goalpost.<p>Also, IMHO smartphones are largely irrelevant anyway. The real battleground is tablets and this is one area where Apple has a <i>phenomenal</i> lead. It's my contention that the digital content and app ecosystems are <i>far</i> more important for tablets than phones (since a greater percentage of even smartphone users spend a greater percentage of their time using ""standard"" functionality, being SMS messaging, phone calls and maps; I believe data on app purchases would back this up).<p>Android is certainly a stunning success and I believe huge credit goes to Andy Rubin and the executive team.

This sort of flaw will continue producing new surprising bugs, potentially any time the code is changed, or any time the compiler's optimizations change. These sorts of bugs are frustrating to track down, because they depend both on details of code optimization, and on details of memory allocation/deallocation history. If you compile with debugging options, you may change what optimizations are used; if you insert debug prints for some old-school log-based analysis, you may change the allocation/deallocation history, so the GC gets triggered in a different place.",1309888458

That's doubly true considering the time investment for reading about the arguments is rather small, 15 minutes or so. And it's triply true considering that very many other people have vetted the argument for you, enough that mainstream media are writing articles on the topic.<p>So no, you don't have to consider every question that's raised ""no matter what"" to be considered intellectually curious, but this is hardly such a trivial, general case as that implies.",1309888446
2730800,comment,2726673,2728446,1,0,bborud,,,"We're talking orders of magnitude here.  J2EE, Spring and other mammoth frameworks that force you to do things in rather convoluted ways are very large (negative) multipliers.<p>The Java language does lead to unnecessarily verbose code, but not shockingly so.  I'd prefer somewhat verbose but idiomatic Java code over similarly idiomatic code-bases in many other languages.<p>Of course, part of the problem is that there are far too many bad programmers (and designers) in the Java community and the reputation of the language suffers because of these people.  Java even started out with some of these horribly bad programmes on the staff of Sun.  (Those of you who actually read the source code of the standard libraries can probably guess who I am talking about).<p>The thing is, though:  I don't really see this as a problem.  In part because it is possible to write reasonable code in Java itself and in part because there are alternative languages that are interoperable with plain Java such as Scala and Groovy.  This means you can benefit from the Java ecosystem, but you have more choice when it comes to how you write code.<p>(That being said: I am skeptical to introducing some things into Java because I don't think it will lead to better code.  For instance I don't want closures because it will tempt inept programmers to over-use these features in contexts where they are not a good fit.  Closures can turn relatively linearly readable code into a horribly tangled mess that can be hard to reason about.  And as I said earlier:  Java has attracted a lot of talent-free programmers)",1309888433

We should be writing libraries for ourselves, not just piling code on top of other code. As an argument, I first offer a few propositions.<p>Any code upon which your project relies can be considered ""part of the code base"". As an example from Rails, it has become a somewhat common/accepted practice to notice a deficiency in a gem, fork it on github, fix it for your needs, and use it. This is especially common if your project depends on abandoned gems that you still need to use, for whatever reason. Even if this isn't a problem, I often need to look into internals to figure out where something is breaking.<p>Then, if code that your code depends on is considered part of the project, if steve was correct, then it would be very hard to use anything more advanced.<p>However, practical wisdom shows that higher level such as Ruby are more productive than lower level languages, such as C. Thus, the original premise is shown false.<p>If the original premise is false, then what is it that steve is noticing? I think it is about leaky abstractions. If you write libraries for yourself, with good, clean interfaces, you do not need to ""notice"" the lines of code from other parts of the project.<p>tl;dr It's about creating abstractions for yourself, not pure LOC count.",1309887628

When passing a lambda expression, you can either get a method reference that you can execute, or you can get a syntax tree of that expression.<p>It is effectively used in Linq to Sql to query databases using the same syntax you would use for querying in-memory collections of objects. You can also teach it to do pretty sweat things, like doing data transformations using the GPU. Check out this project for instance: <a href=""http://brahma.ananthonline.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brahma.ananthonline.net/</a><p>Also, macros are not necessarily executed at compile-time as in C/C++ - in Lisp a macro has no boundaries to when or how it gets executed.

If any of that were violated, he could appeal his case and the appeal would be heard in the same manner as if he were a U.S. citizen being tried in the same New York courts. Even foreign corporations have due-process rights; for example, Texas cannot simply seize a refinery owned by BP without some kind of legal process.<p>The only cases I'm aware of where it's more murky are: 1) non-citizens held by the U.S. armed forces outside the territory of the U.S., alleged to be ""enemy combatants""; and 2) illegal aliens awaiting deportation, who do still have some limited right to due process in challenging their deportation proceedings, but there's more controversy around it.",1309885793

That's a classic mistake.  Buddhism DOES talk about the ability to first limit and later eliminate your <i>REACTIONS</i> to desires, but never the desires themselves.

They do live in the the united states, which means realtive certian other populations, they are insanely wealthy. We scrape by in the lower end of cost of living in this nation with large student debts, and housing costs in the range of $400 a month...from that, it isn't hard to split a netflix bill two or three ways.

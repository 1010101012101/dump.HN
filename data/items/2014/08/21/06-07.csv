8206126,comment,8203425,8205457,1,0,pdonis,,,"&quot;More energy&quot; can mean two different things. In the case of sound, only one of those meanings--the amplitude of the wave--is relevant: soft sounds have lower amplitude and loud sounds have higher amplitude. The frequency of the wave, as jessaustin pointed out, is independent of how soft or loud it is, and for sound, there isn&#x27;t any useful sense in which any frequency carries &quot;more energy&quot; than any other frequency, given that the amplitudes are the same.<p>With regard to light, however, there is a second possible meaning for &quot;more energy&quot;: not a higher amplitude of the classical wave, but more energy contained in a single quantum of the light (i.e., a single photon). Light of higher frequency (toward the blue/ultraviolet end of the spectrum) has more energy per quantum; light of lower frequency (toward the red/infrared/microwave end of the spectrum) has less. This sense of &quot;more energy&quot; is still independent of wave amplitude: wave amplitude corresponds to number of photons (more precisely, the number of photons is proportional to the amplitude squared). So you can have faint light (few photons) of high frequency (more energy per photon); or you can have bright light (lots of photons) of low frequency (less energy per photon). The total energy contained in the light depends on both of these factors; but the total energy in the light is not the crucial factor involved (see below).<p>It turns out that, when you are looking at the possible effects of radiation on the body, the energy per photon is the most important factor, because that is what determines what kind of interactions the radiation can have with the molecules that make up your body. UV, X-rays, and gamma rays have enough energy per photon to break apart the chemical bonds that hold together things like proteins in your cells; that&#x27;s what makes them potentially cancer-causing. Microwaves, OTOH, don&#x27;t have enough energy per photon to break chemical bonds; all they can do is make the molecules, like proteins, vibrate more rapidly, which just means heating them up.",1408602367

The amount of radiation your body is exposed to during the flight is several orders of magnitude larger than the amount it&#x27;s exposed to during the security screening. Not only that, the radiation you&#x27;re exposed to during the flight is higher energy (cosmic rays are the major component) and can do more damage to your body than the microwaves used in the security scanners.",1408601604

You can use RAII with custom allocators. You can use RAII with memory pools.<p>And that&#x27;s where C++ really does shine.

The company was spectacularly successful at raising capital, became one of the lowest cost producers in the world, but still went bankrupt due to massive overcapacity in the market.  Their strategy was to use economies of scale to manufacture a $5 product for $1.  Unfortunately everyone else had the same idea, forcing a minor pivot: make something for $1, sell it for 80 cents, and hope the competition goes bankrupt first.<p>FWIW, I think the same thing happened with hard drive manufacturing 30 years ago.<p><a href=""http://www.themonthly.com.au/eric-knight-shi-zhengrong-sun-king-eric-knight-3363"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.themonthly.com.au/eric-knight-shi-zhengrong-sun-k...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shi_Zhengrong"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shi_Zhengrong</a>",1408601441

I say partial because that&#x27;s not what I usually mean by &quot;deregulation&quot;. &quot;Stripping very specific regulations&quot; is just that, just another law being passed, that flips some switch on or off.<p>When I asked for examples I thought we were talking about total deregulation (I previously thought <i>deregulation</i> was a binary thing - either something is regulated or it isn&#x27;t at all) but I see it is used in other senses (although it is a bit perplexing to me).<p>> Some of those scenarios could have been prevented if more facets had been deregulated<p>Exactly this.",1408601395

People act as if it would be impossible to work at a company where people could know what other people make.<p>Yet, public school teachers have a pay schedule that is pretty cut and dry, government workers&#x27; salaries are public record, etc. Somehow people manage to work those jobs without any kind of mutiny due to freely available information. I&#x27;m sure there are other companies where this works out just fine.<p>Mostly, companies take advantage of the information asymmetry to pay as little as they possibly have to. It works for them as long as people don&#x27;t find out their getting screwed. If people find out, they negotiate better. Ultimately, that probably leads to people getting paid better or getting a better paying job.<p>If companies just took care of the employees well to begin with, it wouldn&#x27;t matter if people knew how much other people were getting paid. At the end of the day, it&#x27;s a problem of greed, and that&#x27;s an unsolvable problem as long as humans are involved.",1408600883

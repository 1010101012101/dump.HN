Another bidder might see 2 hours left for a cheap item, and put in a minimum bid, hoping to win. If you auto-bid them up, then they might further increase their bid. If you snipe them, you bypass any response they have.<p>The system works if all bids were kept secret until the end, but that lowers pricing, and isn&#x27;t what people think when they hear &quot;auction&quot;.<p>Meanwhile, as-is, bidding early benefits you nothing and possibly harms you.",1378511945

You don&#x27;t need to write threaded code to write code that can&#x27;t be used in a threaded environment.

On top of that, Wordpress being a huge plugin based community, you get tons of poorly written plugins that assume they&#x27;re running in a single process environment because the authors simply don&#x27;t know any better.<p>As far as I can tell, most PHP devs seem to think Apache only has a pre-fork mode; they write lengthy articles about how bad Apache is on memory not realizing the only reason it&#x27;s that bad is because they&#x27;re using the oldest and most resource hungry worker mpm.

Even if the business is actually doing better, I was told to not deviate from the previous owner&#x27;s numbers too much unless I have concrete proof of purchasing more than usual from easily traceable sources (so probably not the shady small warehouse store, but Costco Business and Sysco instead). I&#x27;ve seen a friend be audited because she wasn&#x27;t reporting anywhere near what seemed right for the amount of groceries she was buying, and a former owner of another business because the new owner reported way more in sales for the same amount of business (only because the new owner was stupid enough to try to flip the business looking like it was in better shape in a year).<p>All that said, it&#x27;s probably easier to eventually raise a nightclub&#x27;s &quot;profitability&quot; than it is to do the same for a parking lot.",1378510689

Why encapsulate everyone under the same policy of track everything?<p>On the Do Not Track, I think turning it on by default is a bad idea. It gives companies no incentive to follow it and abide by it. (Yes, they have no reason to abide by it right now either). There is no law that says they have to abide by it, but it seems to me they might be more willing to abide by DNT if those that are tracking conscious were to turn it on, rather than it to be turned on by itself. They wouldn&#x27;t lose as many people to track if it was opt in instead of opt out.",1378508601

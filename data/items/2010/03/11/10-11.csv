My company doesn't want to see me go so I've had many teams come to me to try to convince me to stay and join their team. The reasoning I've given is ""I want to work in an entirely new environment with new technologies and with new people"" but it's difficult when you're being offered more money to stay. Hopefully I'm making the right decision :)",1268305171

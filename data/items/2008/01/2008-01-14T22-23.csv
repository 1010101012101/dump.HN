98362,comment,98009,98253,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"It's true.  I'm not computer literate.  I thought I was, but that is because I underestimated what computer literacy meant.  I thought that if I knew how to change the BIOS, knew how to burn a disc, and could unzip files, I could install Linux.<p>Another problem is that my situation is probably an outlier.  My computer is in Spanish, which makes it a lot harder to mess with.  Plus, it runs on Windows XP from 2002.  On top of that, my disk drives are slightly messed up.  They burn correctly according to the MD5 hashes, but one of them might not read well.  Finally, none of the two computer-literate people I know are around, and ""build your own PC"" books are hard to find, universally in Spanish, and expensive (here in Santiago).<p>I'll keep trying until I find the stupid mistake I've been making all along.<p>And you're right.  I'm being hostile; I've spent too much time over the computer over the last few days, and I'm going a little crazy.  But, much like being drunk, driving oneself crazy does not excuse what you do/say when you're kind of crazy.

98353,comment,98227,98265,0,0,icky,,,"> and I should be able to say just (compare > karma).<p>I suggest you implement a terse syntax for partial-apply.  For my own pet lisps, I use {}. (You are welcome to steal it ;-)<p>So {+ 1} would expand to (in scheme) something like (lambda rest (apply + `(1 ,@rest)).  You could keep partial-applying arguments<p><pre><code>  (do
    (= x {+ 1})
    (= y {x 2})
</code></pre>
then actually apply it with ()<p><pre><code>  (y 3 4 5) ; => 15
</code></pre>
Your accumulator generator in Arc:<p><pre><code>  (def foo (n) [++ n _])
</code></pre>
Could be shortened to:<p><pre><code>  (def foo (n) {++ n})   ; even terser than regular Arc!
</code></pre>
The only time you'd need _ is when you want to change the order of the arguments (e.g. you'd never need {+ _ 2}, but you might need {/ _ 3}, or even {/ _ _ _ 3} if you want to jam the first three arguments in front.<p>This has some other interesting properties:<p>- In a lisp-1 OR lisp-2, #'foo can be represented as {foo}.<p>- Your karma macro can fit in there as (compare > {karma})<p>- With the _ variables, it might even be a general case of your [] syntax.<p>- {} stands out visually.  ""Here be electric magic.""<p>- If you ever implement generic functions dispatched left-to-right, you can implement partial dispatch for partial application.",1200350708

Focuses more on whether he can beat the hardest unsolved problems than bragging that he is the best coder. Realizes that such a definitive metric doesn't really exist. The point is that by focusing on the science itself, you can always be challenged and won't be held back by the satisfaction of being better than some other bum.

Thanks for the various links and pointers; I dream of the day that I have time to sit back down with Lisp and finally grok the mysteries of the macro, and articles like yours will help.<p>Language designers seem to agree that the secret to giving Lisp a bright future is to invent a brand new Language of the Future that just happens to encompass Lisp. This is not exactly a new argument around here, since this very site is written in a FutureLisp candidate. Other aspiring FutureLispers include Guy Steele and Matz (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/quotes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/quotes.html</a>).<p>The thing to recognize is that Lisp's storied history is not an advantage. It's actually a big problem for the language. People like new languages. They're not big yet. You can grasp them. Their core team is young and obscure enough that you have a fighting chance to join it. They haven't accumulated decades' worth of parasitic features. They have no installed base that must be accommodated. Their design flaws are not yet so old that they've been enshrined as advantages. They are not steered by a committee of middle-aged managers. They haven't spawned so many children that you can't decide between them all. The experts haven't yet had the chance to become intimidatingly skilled, let alone entrenched and opinionated, let alone bitter and burnt out.<p>The good news is that each decade's new language is a bit more Lispy than the last.

Assuming the status quo; I'm hitting all the major tenents: I travel extensively, I'm married, I've a whole host of life experiences worthy of a book or a movie, I read, I enjoy film, I live in a nice house in a nice neighborhood in NYC, I eat great food.  I have nice friends.  That sounds like living to me?<p>B. If you also define living by including having an impact on other's lives, than indeed I'm living life to the fullest.  No I'm not writing any life saving medical software, but I do write software that people use to express themselves creatively and know a number of the users of my software who have gone on to do some pretty impressive things because of what my software taught them about themselves; their capabilities, talents, etc.  This is why I write software in the first place.<p>Now, could I do this extreme lifestyle if I was working for a bank?  Hell no.  If I was working at an advertising agency?  Hell no.  But guess what?  My extremism has lead me to an oppurtunity to write software for myself and for my own company.  Again, living life to it's fullest.  Instead of helping others chase their business dreams, I am living my own.<p>So get down from your horse, dude.

But it shouldn’t be surprising, not as a first step.<p>Decades after widespread e-mail and web use, very little progress has been made to improve identity and relation representation with a usable design outside of Facebook and its competitors (currently: LinkedIn, twitter; and the less public: Instagram, WhatsApp, SnapChat, Lime) all self-centric platforms. Open social media initiatives have been legions, from blog-based solutions (mainly on top of WordPress) to some revitalisation of OpenSocialNetwork spearheaded by Facebook employees.\nHowever, standard-based platform hit the contradictions raised by social presentation (what is a friend, a follower, should a non-physical person have identity? what should be public?) even harder than a single platform does. At least a corporate monopoly headed by people who don’t mind being called prejudiced can leap over a semester long nasty debate on gender classification, and focus on scalability and fixing bugs.<p>My ever-disappointed hope is that after a handful of social network generations, current decision-makers know how to recognise a coming tide. To preserve their market share, they hopefully will support a working standard. In that regard, having Facebook and Instagram under the same super-management might help agree on some commonalities. I believe it will be in their interest to suggest a usable OpenSocial-4.0 that will first let one connect their accounts within one corporate group. In Facebook/Instagram case, that means articulate multiple identity facets, pseudonyms, challenge the need for civil criteria such as age and gender. Moving further out, it might mean discuss information-sharing for ad-targeting to avoid commercial conflict with competitors. Possibly it might finally let you connect your own server, and your multiple identities to your less savvy friends WordPress blog or twitter feed.<p>From there on, one can hope proving their integrity to their ice-cream clerk without having to bow to too Orwellian institutions. An alternative is to ask a Facebook competitor more agreeable to your concerns (reddit? Moot’s Canvas?) to offer a similar service: though luck if what matters is law enforcement.<p>That war of leaky abstractions against our own laziness to express our social ties has been raging since the 80’s.<p>As icky as post-libertarian can seem, their focus on usability helps set up great services far before any more respectful entity can. Rather than code along and be overtaken, we might benefit from learning how to shift those to more open practice later in their development.",1389156310

Well, that doesn&#x27;t work in the real world obviously. Especially memory allocations WILL fail, so, frankly, deal with it. Haskell makes this impossible, and therefore throws real-world correctness out of the window because it makes mathematical correctness so much messier.<p>Your assertion that this can&#x27;t be caught at the language level is wrong : checking malloc&#x27;ed pointers for NULLness will do it. In java, catch OOM exceptions. This error doesn&#x27;t have to cause your programs to crash. Neither does an infinite loop (&quot;easy&quot; to catch in Java). Given more tools, you can write programs that are safe from some measure of memory corruption.<p>The real world is messy. Pretending it&#x27;s not doesn&#x27;t fix that, and nobody but mathematicians are surprised at all. End result is simple : your programs will crash after you&#x27;ve &quot;proven&quot; it can&#x27;t crash. Running everything in &quot;just-large-enough&quot; VMs has massively exacerbated CPU and OOM error conditions, at least from where I&#x27;m sitting. I&#x27;d expect further cloud developments to make it worse.<p>So the type system only guarantees correctness if the following conditions hold, amongst other things:<p>1) infinite available memory (infinite in the sense that it is larger than any amount the program requests, haskell provides zero guarantees that limit memory usage, so ...)<p>2) infinite available time for program execution (again, for the normal definition of infinite)<p>3) no infinite loops anywhere in your program (more problematic in haskell because every haskell tutorial starts with &quot;look, lazy programming means infinite loops terminate in special case X&quot;, and of course it only works in special cases)<p>Note that this is only the list of &quot;hard&quot; failures. There are factors that can blow up the minimum execution time of your program (e.g. VM thrashing, stupid disk access patterns) that I&#x27;m not even considering. In practice, these &quot;soft&quot; failures, if bad enough, cause failure of the program as well.<p>And only then do we get to the conditions that people keep claiming are the only conditions for haskell to work:<p>4) no hardware malfunctions",1389155607

I&#x27;m sorry, but there are very few Linux professionals I&#x27;ve ever met I&#x27;d consider themselves &quot;experts&quot; who would recommend Ubuntu for their environment. Pretty much 0 except the one guy I work with on the board of Software in the Public Interest (nonprofit that runs Debian). Ubuntu did the smart thing and got onto the &quot;cloud&quot; bandwagon very early. As a result, Ubuntu is likely one of the more pervasive operating systems within that community. The cloud environment is a very small part of the entire Linux ecosystem and doesn&#x27;t equate at _all_ with the high end &quot;enterprise/hpc&quot; industry. Don&#x27;t believe me? Take a look yourself at the top 500 supercomputer breakdown by operating system. Exactly 0 Ubuntu clusters. Ubuntu with high end sans such as EMC/Hitachi/etc? Nope, it plays massive second fiddle to RHEL where those companies first certify their hardware for.<p>Ubuntu is better than Debian regarding security (almost exclusively from the excellent work of Kees Cook, who now works on security for the ChromeOS project at google and hardens the Linux kernel. However, it still can&#x27;t hold a candle to the proactive security features of RHEL (and hence the awful cheapskate CentOS as you call it). Don&#x27;t believe me? Look up the gcc stack smashing protector and fortify source patches. Look at the glibc canary code that also helps (in tandem with the gcc patches) to prevent buffer overflows, execshield (from Ingo Molnar, a redhat employee) before NX bits on cpus were super common, the first mainstream distribution of Linux to include a mandatory access control framework (SELinux) enabled by default. Are some of these features in Ubuntu now? Sure. Why? Because Redhat employees wrote them and got them into upstream software, which downstream distributions like Ubuntu which do precious little engineering have adopted.<p>CentOS <i>is</i> more enterprisey than Ubuntu. Why? Because it is based on the enterprise standard when it comes to Linux, Redhat Enterprise Linux. Ubuntu still sucks with big enterprise SAN gear, it also sucks with some of the more high end networking kit (infiniband on Ubuntu, possible, but a royal PITA and the vendors laugh at you), it is terrible for realtime stuff, but it is fantastic if you want the same interface on your desktop, tablet, and phone. If you don&#x27;t know your way around Linux (your comment about not knowing your way around Redhat), perhaps you shouldn&#x27;t be managing Linux servers and you&#x27;re helping contribute to the list of botnet nodes due to not having a clue what you&#x27;re doing? Again, I work on Linux fulltime and have for awhile, the major serious differences between Redhat and Ubuntu/Debian:<p><pre><code>    - /etc/network/interfaces vs /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-*\n\n    - /etc/default vs /etc/sysconfig\n\n    - metapackages for everything vs yum groups\n\n    - dpkg/apt vs rpm/yum\n\n    - Building debs vs building rpms (I could rant for a day on how much ridiculously easier it is to build redhat packages)\n\n    - Preseed vs Kickstart (wth was Ian Murdoch thinking here? Preseed is still years behind kickstart in being awesome)\n\n\n</code></pre>\nIf you know Linux, you can learn those differences well in less than a week. Linux isn&#x27;t obvious, it requires a lot of reading and experience. My whole point is basically that you are completely wrong and quite clearly don&#x27;t realize you are wrong because you don&#x27;t seem to have an idea of what you&#x27;re even talking about. I do personally think Mark Shuttleworth and the Canonical crew are doing wonderful things for desktop Linux, and general Linux marketing, but they&#x27;ve done tons less when it comes to Linux engineering compared to what Redhat has done.<p>Sorry for the rant. It isn&#x27;t normally my style, but this is just ridiculous. Feel free to downvote this, but please do some reading and learn Linux. You&#x27;ll realize I&#x27;m likely right.",1389155403

If you have ever worked with UCM ClearCase by IBM, you&#x27;ll understand that everything works at the stream/branch level. When you create a new UCM project, you construct it by picking points (baselines) from streams/branches, which can come from different pvobs (repositories).

I&#x27;m not sure it ever makes sense to do comparative benchmarking, since you can&#x27;t test on arbitrarily large inputs (which is what&#x27;s important when looking at algorithm complexity). For smaller inputs (for example, N in the 1000-1 million range), constant factors impact running time significantly. To compensate, you&#x27;d have to run a benchmark of size 10^10,000,000.<p>EDIT: For an example, let&#x27;s say the current best algorithm for some problem takes O(N^2), with a small constant (let&#x27;s say 100 * N^2 operations). Then someone comes up with a O(N^1.9), but with a larger constant (let&#x27;s say it takes 1,000,000 * N^1.9).

It&#x27;s more expensive, but, it manages just about everything for you.  Maybe you make the decision to switch to RDS  Now you turn down that EC2 instance running your database.<p>Maybe now you&#x27;re thinking that RabbitMQ is too much of a pain to manage, so you do the same thing with SQS.  Analyze the time/cost savings of switching, and see if it makes sense.<p>I think for new applications, estimating is a lot harder, right?  You have no traffic until someone is interested in your product, but you can sort of spitball.  There&#x27;s a bunch of free load testing services out there to let you roughly simulate N concurrent users, and open-source projects to simulate those users yourself.<p>Ultimately, and maybe someone has an idea how to do this: I don&#x27;t think you can ever plan beforehand.  You could be optimistic, and assume your app is going to explode, and that you&#x27;ll need 8 web servers and redundant load balancers and DB with a read replica... but that&#x27;s just what it seems like, optimistic.  I think the closest you can get is spitballing -- assuming maybe you&#x27;ll get 100 concurrent users or something -- and making sure you can handle that.<p>Separately, there&#x27;s the whole issue of trying to make smart decisions ahead of time with your infrastructure, but similarly, this can be really hard to do.",1441976090

And yes, keeping it similar to standard function/object calls lowers the cognitive load.<p>Hmm, yep recursion not supported atm, although we are thinking of extending the basic system shortly - there are a lot of other features we&#x27;d like to add - true sum types, a dynamic operator, and more.<p>Python annotations are nice, and a lot of users have asked for a way to annotate RPC functions in their code. Doing this all in a cross-language way will be hard and so we&#x27;re thinking of keeping the external definition in the meantime.<p>--<p>Thanks so much for your advice. We&#x27;re certainly looking at past attempts, and the research in transferring data is vast - I think it boils down to a trade-off between expression and usability - and for now JSON seems to have found pretty good sweet spot. Perhaps with just a simple schema layer on top that will be suitable for most use-cases. I imagine Thrift, ProtoBufs, etc will always beat it on speed, XML (+XML Schema) on expressibility, etc.<p>For us, as you have guessed, we are just trying to make it as easy as possible for the majority of users – particularly web and mobile developers. This does also mean we&#x27;re trying to stay language agnostic and find a type subset that works across most languages - JSON primitives let us get some of the way there.<p>Thank you so much for all your advice - it&#x27;s been so helpful and we&#x27;re really happy you took the time out to try it all and record your thoughts.

Hmm, machineless, now that is interesting - I imagine with phone processors such a thing will become, if not already is, possible.<p>Yes! I wish there was a way to really define and lock-down exactly what communication/serialisation primitives are required to aid communication between systems. Though I imagine you are right in that we&#x27;ve come quite far with common practices.<p>Haha - yes the Barrister docs can be a bit confusing - we are getting around to writing a simpler version of them with common examples and use-cases. We really like the schema itself as it does map onto JSON semantics quite nicely.<p>1) Yep, the messaging format could def be simpler! We just felt that as we&#x27;re starting out it would be better to stick with standards, even if, as you say, they are nascent. This reduces the amount of things we have to do but also we hope that people much smarter than have thought about the issues involved! Hopefully the client-side bindings will hide most but if needed it&#x27;s nice to now you can drop down to the JSON format.<p>2) Hmm, JSON by example, this is super interesting!! I fully understand where you are coming from and it seems so much simpler than JSON-Schema (I was never a fan) Using values as types is quite elegant, and reminds me of some of the type-level programming stuff in the functional circles.<p>The use of multiple entries in a JSON object seems like a nice way to express sum types - something we are really keen to add to the Barrister IDL (you can extend from an object but I believe there is only a single tree). As you note, although this valid JSON, it may require a custom parser to extract. I&#x27;d love to hear more about this technique tho, has it been used elsewhere or is there any further documentation?<p>3) Primitives - yes, it&#x27;d certainly be possible to specify other primitives by encoding them in the JSON string value. Could be risky, as you suggest, when you start looking at regexes and so on - I&#x27;ve not been the biggest fan of defining these as types in the past. Also, how would one go about defining a user-defined type at the equivalent level of a primitive? Super interesting tho, if you have any more thoughts on this I&#x27;d love to read them.",1441976037

10203367,comment,10144734,10175570,0,0,mands,,,"Thanks so much.<p>Yes, we&#x27;ve pivoted a few times, first starting out with trying to be the &#x27;github for live API&#x27;s, which is an idea we love but found that the chicken-and-egg situation was tricky to overcome, and that most users just wanted a way to deploy their code to the code to support a webservice.<p>As such we pivoted to building a shared hosting service that let&#x27;s users just write their code and deploy it.<p>Regarding your 3 questions, my preliminary responses would be (bear in mind we probably would need to think about this further!),<p>1) We were super excited by the idea based on our own use cases - I found it a nightmare trying to build a distributed back-end to process video in the cloud for a previous startup. This got in the way of building my product but had to be done. Similarly, my co-founder ahead ran into the same issue when he needed to perform web-rendering on the server and just needed an easy way to wrap up this functionality. At this point we though perhaps we could use containers to wrap up the code but found the container ecosystem was focussed heavily on dev-ops and not services, so we built this.<p>2) Yes, totally agree - our messaging needs a lot of work, we&#x27;ve actually become a lot better in real life but unfortunately haven&#x27;t updated the website to reflect this!<p>The basic problem is that deploying your code to the cloud is hard. After writing your code locally, you have to do all kinds of orchestration to get your code into the cloud, run it at scale, handle faults, client integration, and more. We feel we can make this simpler.<p>As for why you&#x27;d want to move your code to the cloud, hmm, that&#x27;s a good question. Why the cloud? Don&#x27;t worry about physical infrastructure., have capacity and capability to scale up compute resources dynamically, ignore hardware maintenance and amortise sys-ops costs with other users.<p>Getting across why users want our code to get to the cloud, if they know what the cloud is, is tricky.  
Absolutely, becoming an easy way to get code into the cloud followed after this, as we realised just how hard it was. We&#x27;ve moved to the cloud but our tools haven&#x27;t.<p>3) Yes, this is the hard bit. Lots of users have existing code, perhaps in the cloud already or locally deploy. They don&#x27;t know or care about Docker / Kubernetes, etc - and shouldn&#x27;t have to. We think Docker is a great building block to build services on top of, but we should be able to abstract it away and build on top of it. Eventually we&#x27;d hope we can get across our core message - deploy your code to the cloud as easy as running locally - without ever mentioning containers, docker, and more. Perhaps we can do that now, we just to update our message to get that across.<p>For now we&#x27;re thinking of targeting client-side JS developers as an initial niche and going deep with that while we figure out our tech and message. but yes, the core message is the same - a really simple way to write some code and get it hosted in the cloud as simply as possible (and yes, with a free tier also). It can, and should, be simpler.",1441976002

Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I use them all the time, but it kinda feels like when you&#x27;ve got tables that you just know could be normalized more thoroughly.<p>Why is that? There are many use cases for data (like vector data) which really needs an array. And it would be unwise to store it as columns. Think of, for example, matrix data or a practically unbounded number of double values coming from a sensor. Plus, PostgreSQL has a limit in the number of columns (1600) of a table, of which you could run out soon if representing this kind of data as regular columns rather than array values.",1441975042

Unfortunately, just like deciphering all of the names is very difficult as OP demonstrated so well, understanding the use cases where you can get a good value as a customer is also esoteric and poorly documented.  While AWS has pretty good docs in general for each service.  Most of the naive implementations presented in tutorials and docs would not be a valuable reason for a customer to use the service.  I wonder if documenting this type of stuff better would help them grow the business or if they just don&#x27;t care and they want to just rip off as many faces as possible.

Also jor1k supports the newest privilege instruction API whereas Angel hasn&#x27;t been updated yet.<p>Especially the jor1k port is assembler optimized by looking at the code the Javascript engines produce. I get up to 120 MIPS. But a comparison with Angel is unfair, because Javascript doesn&#x27;t support 64-Bit yet.<p>From my side the main idea is support the number of MMIO devices with virtio, framebuffer, network, sound and so on. Unfortunately the device support is still in an unfinished state and I don&#x27;t know where RISC-V will go in the future.<p>So at the moment you get just a dumb terminal and block device, which is pretty useless.<p>There are also other reasons. The RISC-V project is more active currently than OpenRISC. So I hope to get finally a real distribution running with package management. There is still no native gdb for OpenRISC for example.

However, I still disagree with your business model. At $100 a pop, you would need so much traffic from this niche to pay the salary of a full-time developer (or designer, in your case), unless you broadened the scope.<p>Elance/oDesk/99Designs and other sites just have more room to monetize than a one-time $100 upfront fee. If designers get a lot more inbound from this, you&#x27;re essentially giving them leads, so it makes sense for the startups to find great designers and the designers take a percentage cut for having much of the heavy early lifting done for them.<p>I also don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to reach much scale with a domain like folyo.me -- it&#x27;s just not good. I love your design work, but branding is key too, and while a domain like that might be good enough to validate your idea I don&#x27;t think you can have a runaway hit with that.",1376542537

You could get some initial protection by terminating the onion frontend traffic on &quot;tamper resistant, untraceable, throwaway nodes&quot;, and then backhaul (maybe via Tor?), to other servers, etc.  The frontends would be able to do some local processing to maybe break up the traffic somewhat.<p>All of this kind of stuff would impair site reliability.  IMO, if SR went down more often, I&#x27;d have a higher opinion of the paranoid exhibited by the admins.  A highly reliable underground site is usually either 1) run by people who are going to get caught or 2) run by people who are doing the catching.

It depends on how the program invokes its plug-ins. If the program uses fork and exec to invoke plug-ins, then the plug-ins are separate programs, so the license for the main program makes no requirements for them.<p>If the program dynamically links plug-ins, and they make function calls to each other and share data structures, we believe they form a single program, which must be treated as an extension of both the main program and the plug-ins. This means the plug-ins must be released under the GPL or a GPL-compatible free software license, and that the terms of the GPL must be followed when those plug-ins are distributed.<p>If the program dynamically links plug-ins, but the communication between them is limited to invoking the main function of the plug-in with some options and waiting for it to return, that is a borderline case.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.blender.org/education-help/faq/gpl-for-artists/#c6711"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blender.org/education-help/faq/gpl-for-artists/#c...</a><p>&quot;Can I sell plug-ins for Blender?<p>Yes you can, but only if you provide the plug-in and the sources to your clients under the GNU GPL license.

CSPRNGs have bugs. When you rely on a userland CSPRNG, you&#x27;re relying on two single points of failure: the userland CSPRNG and the OS&#x27;s CSPRNG.

In my opinion, that&#x27;s the worst of both worlds-- inconsistent code, plus C++ overheads.<p>I work with some fairly recent version of both compilers-- gcc 4.7.2 and clang 3.2.  I also know a developer on the LLVM team.  clang is way ahead of gcc in many ways, and the gcc devs know it.<p>We still ship software built with gcc, rather than clang, because gcc is still better at optimization.

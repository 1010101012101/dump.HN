10291034,comment,10289742,10290540,0,0,inversionOf,,,"The other comment about electronics is completely off the mark as well -- people often see financial transactions that don&#x27;t seem to make logical sense (whether pricing bots that recursively keep pricing off of each other, as in the linked story, or prices that seem too good to be true, which more likely are gray market or arbitrage) and immediately explain it as money laundering. But consider the electronics sales, where the premise is that people are selling electronics that they apparently bought from Amazon using gift cards under the market just to launder cash.<p>There is an enormous financial black hole that is just as vulnerable to inspection as simply depositing $1,000,000 in cash in your account. The whole point of money laundering is not only to legitimize the output, it&#x27;s to make the sources untraceable and arguably viable as well.<p>The components of a transaction, particularly for the sales of goods, cannot simply appear out of nowhere, or they&#x27;ve done absolutely nothing in the way of money laundering. The people who will ever care about this (the ones who money laundering is constructed to fool) aren&#x27;t so naive, and if you&#x27;re selling 100,000 hard drives to justify your income, they&#x27;re going to ask where you got the hard drives, and demand a financial trail.<p>Cash businesses that have little variable costs outside of manpower (such as carwashes, laundrymats, even some small restaurants, or selling small crafts on Etsy) are absolutely lucrative tools for money laundering, and can only really get caught if put under heavy scrutiny (e.g. car wash with 10 cars over the week claims revenue of $100,000). As are casinos, and Vegas was built on money laundering -- there are few checks on how much you spend, so whether you spent $1,000,000 in unexplained cash to leave with $950,000 in legitimate winnings, or $10 in legitimate cash to leave with $950,000 in legitimate winnings, it&#x27;s almost impossible to prove.<p>There are many, many financial vehicles that are used for money laundering, including life insurance.

Of course if you want to argue that any women that happens to fancy me is not real by definition, you have shown already the quality of your logic.<p>And, speaking of general principles. Take a look to the template-argument: &quot;Because <group X> are inherently different of <group Y>, they get treated differently and that&#x27;s the way it is. Therefore, any member of <group X> that complains about the status quo only makes things worse&quot;. Whenever you see that, you can be pretty sure the people who floated that idea in the first place, must be taking unfair advantage of group X (though not necessarily has to belong to group Y). So, a counter argument can be made that every member of group X that believes in such argument is brainwashed and acting against the interest of group X in general.<p>Speaking of gender roles, there was a time still on living memory, when wife-beating was socially acceptable. I know for a fact, because I have spoken with a number of old folks, that even if those times, there were plenty of decent guys who would never hurt their wives, but when they learned of a jackass kicking the crap out of <i>his</i> wife, they would not move a finger unless (maybe) if it was clear that her life was in imminent danger.<p>Now, the sad thing about that history was not that there were jack-asses half a century ago (there are plenty of those today, too), but that the victims were shooed down by society at large. And the really sad thing is that the individuals doing the enforcing and keeping the beated wives quiet were all other women applying the logic of &quot;women that complain about their husband&#x27;s methods of discipline make matters worse.&quot;",1443454265

Its going to be hard to environmentally amortize the cost of the heat engine.  Spending the resources on better insulation would have a much higher payoff.

You are still limited in what you can do, such as writing a native extension module for your existing Python code base. And they don&#x27;t really help on one of the major selling points of Rust, which is to be able to write safe multi-threaded code with shared, mutable data structures. While there may be lots of good high-level parallelism available, at some point for certain problems you really just want to be able to use a shared, mutable data structure, but doing so in almost any language but Rust makes it very easy to make a mistake and have aliased, mutable references to it that can invalidate all of your logic, even if it isn&#x27;t actually memory unsafe.",1443453433

I&#x27;ve been doing plenty of event-driven programming in Python (using Twisted), which is great for non-blocking network I/O, but there are other ways to block on long computations, disk I/O, blocking in native libraries, and so on. At some point, you really do need good multi-threading, and Python falls fairly short in that department. You can hobble by, but it&#x27;s not pretty.<p>Go doesn&#x27;t solve either of these problems. It has slightly more static typing than Python, but without generics, it&#x27;s pretty limited. It doesn&#x27;t really do anything to prevent nasty race conditions with shared data structures in multithreaded code. Sure, if you are disciplined and use only message passing of immutable data structures, you can avoid some problems, but part of the point is that when programming in the large, with multiple people working on something over multiple years, it&#x27;s easy for some mistakes or bad assumptions to creep in an wind up causing problems.<p>I&#x27;ve taken a look at Go, and it never really appealed to me as a direction to move in. If I want message passing concurrency in a GC&#x27;d language with a runtime, I can use Erlang/Elixir. If I want just simple, pretty code without much multithreading, I can use Python. If I want raw performance and low level access, I can use C or C++.<p>Rust actually does offer advantages over all of these. It does have it&#x27;s complexity, so for quick and dirty scripting tasks I&#x27;m likely to stick with Python. But especially once Rust gets an easier to use non-blocking I/O story (since event based non-blocking is great for networking), I&#x27;m going to be seriously considering it simply as a replacement for Python for any large project that will be worked on by several people over several years, just due to the additional safety and static guarantees it offers.",1443452810

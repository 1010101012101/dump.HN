1552053,comment,1551121,1551568,0,0,eavc,,,"I understand that, and I sympathize with it. In fact, that is probably the majority opinion, the popular position. It was also my position until recently--some of it still is my position.<p>You are right about much of what you're saying here. Please know that I'm not trying to be glib or sarcastic. If I was being short with my reply, it was because I was in the exam room of a doctor typing on my phone while waiting on her to get back and resume our interview and examination for prescribing medication for my new diagnosis of ADHD. So in a way this discussion is serendipitous for me.<p>Let me offer a difference of opinion on a few small points in what you've said here.<p>First, unless you're doing it wrong (pardon the meme), then you will not be wrapping up problems and tucking them away. Not into a diagnosis, not anywhere. But to discount the diagnosis would be an equally problematic mistake to embracing it as a catch-all.  If you're diagnosed as having rotten roots beneath a tooth of yours, that doesn't wrap the problem of a toothache up in that diagnosis so that you can then go about ignoring it. It ascribes a cause and a probable form of treatment to your situation.<p>If you have ADHD, it is a part of who you are, absolutely. It's a part of your strengths as well as your struggles. But your question here was, ""What am I doing wrong?"" and if you've been diagnosed as ADHD, there's an excellent change you can find good answers that encompass and respect the totality of your person by going further down that trail.<p>As for the lack of a litmus test, I strongly empathize with that idea as well. While I am neither a psychiatrist nor a psychologist, I have been paying attention to this issue, trying to go deeper into those reservations.<p>In fact, there are some good tests for ADHD that don't just rely on an interview with a psychiatrist (though I would argue that that interview has more validity to it than you might be willing to grant it). There are brainwave scans that can be done. There are functional tests. There are eye-tracking tests.<p>That last bit about bad habits is the one that I think is most doggedly pernicious, at least based on my experience.  My thinking went along these lines: I'm lazy. I'm undisciplined. These things are hard for everyone. These are behavioral problems, not biological problems--matters of willpower, not matters of capability.<p>The thing about psychological disorders is that they can all be dismissed as bad behavior, as moral issues, if you are prepped to see it that way, especially for the layman. We've gotten better as a society at acknowledging naturalistic, deterministic causes to these things in order of severity. Things like schizophrenia or dissociative disorder or mania--that stuff we look at and say, ""Yeah, there's probably something off with the chemistry or structure of that person's brain.""  With something like dysthymia or ADHD, though, we still are more inclined to discount the physiological, the neurological components of that cycle of behaviors.<p>To an extent, you're right. These are learned behaviors. Cognitive-behavioral therapy can do a world of good in undoing them. Heck, even just adapting through self-management can do a lot of good. At the same time, the two worlds, that of mind and body, are inexorably linked. They determine one another in either a vicious or virtuous circle.<p>Proper treatment for ADHD addresses both aspects of that reality. It addresses your personhood and your physicality, your learned behaviors as well as your proclivities.<p>I'm not trying to be overbearing here. Please excuse me, and I certainly don't presume to know much about you or your condition. But I hope you're open at least to reconsidering your views on ADHD, or maybe not even reconsidering, just broadening and deepening.<p>I see so much of myself in what you've described here, and when I saw that you've been diagnosed as ADHD, it lined up with the self-discovery I am in the process of. Your reply here does that even more so, and while I don't want to diminish your individuality and your uniqueness, I think we may be a lot alike and can help one another by having this discussion. I'm open to having my mind changed--I'm not singularly focused on getting you to take meds or anything; other than maybe validating my decision, I have no motive for doing so. That said, validating, or invalidating, each of our positions only stands to bring more light to the situation for each of us and may be of some benefit to other observers as well.<p>In short, I understand if you disagree with me, and that's certainly your right, but if you'd be willing, I'd love to go back and forth a little more, for our mutual benefit. This reply is my effort to that end, and I hope it doesn't come across as arrogant or rude or dismissive in any way. It's just a topic I care a lot about right now, and in my opinion, it may be one that could yield the type of breakthroughs that you opened this post in hopes of finding.<p>Sorry for the length!",1280253298

1552045,comment,1551121,1551121,0,0,agotterer,,,"I think it's safe to say that everyone gets a little demotivated at times. For the majority they are able to overcome this. I don't believe in changing your environment in an attempt to be motivated (don't move somewhere). But I do believe the things that surround you are what drives you.<p>It sounds like your jobs is boring and unchallenging. You havent gotten a pay raise in 3 years. I know it's not always about money. But money can definitely be a motivator. It sounds like your managers aren't very good or the company has financial difficulties. No raise for 3 years in unacceptable and says ""we don't appreciate you"". Time to look for another more interesting job. As some other mentioned, try a startup.<p>Which leads me into my next point. Surround yourself with smart, motivated people. The environment you put yourself in can make a huge difference. Joining a startup will give you access to smart people doing interesting things. Go to meetups, talks, etc.. Meet people who are actually doing something. Have a drink, lunch, dinner, whatever with 1 or 2 people who are actively working on something. Offer your suggestions and feedback to them regarding their projects (most people dont turn down free feedback). I think if you spend enough time with people in the community and actively trying to accomplish stuff, you might get motivated to do something yourself or one of those people might want to do something with you.<p>As for the gym. If you can afford it, hire a personal trainer. Try and book a bunch of classes in advance. Its easy to be lazy and not go to the gym after work. But if you've already paid for the classes and made an appointment you might be more willing to show up.",1280253149

This [2] is a review of various types of unconscious prejudices that people entertain and you could well imagine what the consequences are for women. However, if you want experimental evidence, then Googling 'experiment gender discrimination' (leaving out 'for' or 'against' on purpose), yields plenty [3] of [4] studies [5] that support the common assertion that women are continuously being discriminated against. Admission to, and opportunities within, CS is simply no exception.<p>I can't do any better than Googling it; that's what I did years ago when I was looking to verify that women really were being discriminated against, because I figured we would surely be past such barbaric behavior. Since then, I wised up on the fact that we're just not really that much in control of  our behavior. I'm not a psychologist, but I do know how to find and apprehend research in such a domain.

While America is wealthier overall today, it seems like the previous 100 years did more to spread the growth in wealth across the whole population and make <i>society</i> wealthier as people benefited from universities, roads, better health and housing, etc.  These aren't fully formed or vetted ideas, just thoughts.<p>Regarding the article, if GM is selling and making more cars overseas, then maybe just owning 60% of the company and profits is the best outcome.

The reflexive answer is always âfrom consumers China and other emerging economies.â  There are a few problems with that: (1) workers in China and other low wage countries donât make very much and, therefore, have less to spend. (2)  Those low wage workers have a very strong propensity to save, rather than consume. (In China the saving rate may be as high as 30%, and consumer spending is only around a third of GDP v. 70% in the U.S.) (3) It would be extraordinarily naive to think that the Chinese government will not manipulate things to insure that the vast majority of sales in China go to Chinese companies (in many cases companies using technology transferred from the West as part of Chinaâs industrial policy.)<p>The fact is that we are very far indeed from a place where consumers in countries like China are going to pick up the slack when consumers in America and the rest of the developed world finally fail to get the job done. And thereâs yet another problem: While China has benefited from globalization, it is by no means immune to the impacts of automation. In the long run factories and other business in China will also automate, and unemployment will become a serious problem.

Existing popular frameworks do not provide ""convention-over-configuration"" assistance in terms of straddling the network or exposing Model definitions to Javascript etc. They render interfaces on the server-side, rather than letting controllers and views interact on the client for example.

You're also correct that a modern ""paleo"" diet doesn't have all that much in common with a hunter-gatherer's diet anyway.<p>But as a useful heuristic for coming up with a healthy diet for weight loss in the modern world, it's not too bad. If you're trying to lose weight only three things really matter:<p>a) Are you maintaining a calorie deficit?<p>b) Are you getting enough nutrients?<p>c) Is the diet easy to stick to, or does it make you hungry/give you cravings?<p>The paleo diet seems to work fairly well by all of these metrics. It's really just a standard low-GI diet with a few other things unnecessarily banned (beans, dairy). The restrictive nature of the diet means you eat a diet rich in meats and vegetables, which are nutrient rich and fill you up with relatively few calories. The low-GI nature of the diet stabilizes your blood sugar and stops you getting the hunger pangs you'd get on a more carb-rich calorie-restictive diet. And it seems to be relatively easy to stick to with only a moderate amount of willpower -- I've been on it for nearly three weeks now and the idea of eating a brownie just gives me a headache.<p>I don't think I'd recommend it to anyone trying to maintain weight, since I think it would be difficult and expensive to consume enough calories for a healthy lifestyle without eating modest amounts of grains. And the prohibition on beans and dairy is probably unnecessary. But as a workable heuristic for weight loss, ""eat paleo foods"" isn't half bad.",1280251597

So while by definition you can't stop involuntarily torturing yourself, you can at least stop freaking out <i>about</i> it. Seriously, it'll be ok.<p>The second suggestion is, when unsure what to do, consider Christopher Alexander's question: What feels more alive? The more attention you pay to that, the easier it is to get unstuck. The trick is to not prejudge the answer. Turn down the volume as best you can on the ""I should be doing X"" and just attend to what feels more alive. You don't even necessarily need to do anything about it; once you start to get a handle on what your soul (<-- insert favorite metaphor here) really craves, it will pull you along. In fact it will haunt you until you have no choice but to comply. Which is convenient!<p>Edit: I need to add a third. The pain you feel about other people (e.g. on HN) doing great things is mostly an illusion that comes from making the big mistake that Hugh Macleod calls comparing your inside to somebody's outside.

And you don't know what you want because you don't know who you are. And you don't know who you are because you're allowed to be anyone you want."" What you are experiencing is called a quarter life crisis (this is great read <a href=""http://www.eyeweekly.com/article/55882"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eyeweekly.com/article/55882</a>).<p>I had the exact same feeling, at the exact same age, it might have even been at the exact same time of the year.  So what did i do about it?  I went to Culinary School, i needed to prove to myself that i could actually accomplish something i set my mind too.  Cooking is perfect for that, i'm not talking about working from a recipe, i am talking about creating your own recipe, having your own idea for what will taste good together.  The parallels between recipes and businesses are amazing.  You start off with a concept/idea, you begin to do research (this is usually where people get stuck in business), you actually do something and finally you see if your initial idea was successful.  In cooking the definition of success is clear, either your food tastes like shit or it doesn't.  In business the definition of success is a little more convoluted but if you look at success from a monetization perspective then its either making you money or not.<p>So what does culinary school have to do with feeling like shit?  Accomplishing something makes you feel great, it builds your confidence especially within a group of peers.  Not everyday will be your shining moment but once-in-a-while you will be better then everybody else and you will understand success.  From that point onwards you will continue to drive towards that feeling because you know understand what it tastes like.<p>What can you do?\n1. Find something like culinary school. Not a business idea, something else that you think you are good at but haven't really focused on.  Something that has a lot of small tangible results.  Things that have a lot of tangible results can equal a lot of little victories.  \n2. Find something where you will compete against others because if you cant measure yourself to someone else, how do you know you have succeeded.\n3. Don't worry about commitment, when you start succeeding all the rest of the stuff will go away.<p>I hope that helps.  For me my whole life changed i met my wife, i built an ego, learned how to cook like a chef and finally understood what success really felt like.",1280250047

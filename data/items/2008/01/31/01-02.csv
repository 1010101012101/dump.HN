Hmmm, that would make a great startup right?",1201743995

107203,comment,106775,107107,0,0,cawel,,,"There were 4 rooms for my first C++ class at uni: 3 with brand new Pentium II's and 1 with the old (and slow) 486's. No wonder, nobody wanted to be in that latter room for the exam at the end of the semester. So the teacher had to randomly dispatch people in those 4 rooms.<p>Funny surprise: the results from the 486's room were slightly better (than the results in other rooms). Hypotheses: people in the 486's room were thinking twice before launching the slow compilation (leading to less compilation errors), as opposed to launching it often in other rooms (with probably more compilation errors). Bottom line: increasing the focus reduces waste of time.",1201743318
107202,comment,106893,107155,0,0,tb,,,"I have a friend who was suspended from high-school for (indirectly) refusing to do a word puzzle. His stated reason is that he doesn't like word puzzles. When he was asked to leave the room for failing to follow instructions, he refused. The punishments escalated and he refused each one on the basis that it was overblown punishment for refusing to do a word puzzle. Eventually he reluctantly agreed to a week's suspension because the only worse punishment available was expulsion.<p>He still carps on about being suspended for a week for refusing to do a word puzzle.",1201743034

This is the sort of crap that makes me happy not to be any kind of celebrity.<p>The only statement here that seems accurate to me is that many people are motivated by envy. Even ""Schadenfreude"" is the wrong term to use; releasing Arc is hardly any kind of misfortune.

If you're an artist and not a developer, just submit your PSD to a service like psd2html.com, and bada bing bada boom you've got yourself xhtml 1.0 transitional, CSS based design, etc. If you're a developer, you're usually better off hiring some nice design company...unless of course you're skilled enough to handle both design and code? In which case...you'd probably know all this 8 tips he gives?<p>And if you don't know these general ideas, why not just hire someone?

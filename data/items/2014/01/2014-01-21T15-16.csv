Even with the explosive growth of mobile devices, the PC market is still bigger - and I suspect that the reasons for why people aren&#x27;t buying so many PCs anymore is due to (a) lack of innovation and (b) PCs have a long life and a 4-year old PC or laptop is working just fine for most people.

I used most versions of Windows going back to the early 90s, and have generally been on Mac OS X since 2006 (except at some jobs).  I&#x27;m still very familiar with Windows up to Windows 7, but I remember being horrified when trying to help my parents figure out their new laptop running Windows 8.  It was so hard to show them how to use it for even their most basic needs.  Last week I was trying to help a friend locate Wordpad on Windows 8.  I thought about cheating and seeing if the search worked as well as Spotlight, but I was determined to figure out the usual path to open it, and the steps seem so much slower than most versions of Windows.  I understand that people can simply learn the new ways, but Microsoft&#x27;s claim to fame was that their OS was good for all the people who aren&#x27;t good at computers.  It&#x27;s not like the new look and feel is going to convert people from Mac and Linux, so what competitive edge does Windows have now if their own users are struggling so much?",1390319181

Yes there are limitations and the admin of the site isn&#x27;t quite as easy, but when you haven&#x27;t got much admin it&#x27;s ok.<p>The most important reason for choosing Tumblr was the Submissions feature. Visitors can submit a post just as I need it to be. It costs them nothing, it costs me nothing - all the hard work is done (mostly - I obviously need to do some editing, but this is minimal.)<p>But the absolute killer feature of Tumblr is the queue. Without this, there&#x27;s no way I could manage the site.<p>Would I like more features from Tumblr? Sure. Will it happen? Probably not. Do I <i>need</i> those features? Not right now.<p>I handle all submissions myself, the Twitter feed, Facebook Page, Google+ page... all done by me (with the help of the awesome <a href=""http://bufferapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bufferapp.com/</a>)<p>I use IFTTT (<a href=""http://ifttt.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ifttt.com</a>) to check for new posts on Tumblr and cross-post to Buffer (Twitter) and Facebook - this isn&#x27;t perfect yet because I&#x27;d like it to use Buffer for Facebook, Twitter and Google+, but IFTTT doesn&#x27;t support that yet.<p>Technically the $10/month for Buffer is a cost... but I use it personally and on other projects, so this is obviated by the fact that I would be using it anyway.<p>I use the awesome BuySellAds (<a href=""http://buysellads.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://buysellads.com</a>) to serve ads.

The middle class and the poor use much more of their money for everyday things, and the price of these everyday things has increased tremendously over the last 75 years.  Take a look at this US inflation chart (and that is if you believe the US Gov inflation data, which I don&#x27;t):<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_Historical_Inflation_Ancient.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_Historical_Inflation_An...</a><p>Notice that prior to the 50&#x27;s, there were balanced periods of inflation and deflation.  Since the 50&#x27;s, there has only been inflation.  When the price of housing and food goes up, the middle class and poor people take it up the ass, while rich people who are making money via loans to the MC and poor and raking in much more in interest (for example).<p>When the top 15 US banks are about to go under, the government and Fed buy all their bad assets (loans) with currency the create by pushing a button.  Nothing useful or productive is done to create this &quot;value&quot;.  That new currency is used by the banks to further increase their wealth by manipulating the stock and commodities markets.  And yeah, sure - the upper middle class people who have money left over from their paycheck can invest in these markets and increase their wealth.  Well, they can until the rug gets yanked out.  And when that happens, you can bet the large pension funds, banks, government officials, and those 85 rich bastards will be given plenty of notification before the big crash.  But the average Joe invested in the market won&#x27;t: he will take it up the ass.  It&#x27;s just another way the rich and influential profit from the masses.<p>Think about the cost increases in food, higher education and the medical system for example.  Way, way higher than general inflation.  These higher costs force middle class people into lower class, and force lower class people onto government assistance.<p>ANd please don&#x27;t say Bitcoin is going to fix this.  Digital currency is the ultimate wet dream for the rich, because they will be able to track AND TAX every single transaction, including those to your babysitter or yard guy.  Eliminating all untaxed financial transactions and monitoring every transaction is the overloards&#x27; ultimate goal.<p>I&#x27;m not saying technology is not a factor - clearly it is.  One accountant can do much more with a computer than several accountants could do before computers, robots in factories obviously displace workers, and outsourcing jobs to countries with extremely low wages is a problem.  But I think these pale in comparison to currency devaluation over the long term.",1390316529

They can work for games that end up selling 10 million copies, but there&#x27;s a reason why professional software with few users is usually priced between $500 and $100 000.<p>$5 is worth 3 minutes of developer time at common hourly contracting prices. If a developer receives and <i>reads</i> an email from a customer, they will probably end up with no profit. If they <i>respond</i> to it, let alone are adding new custom features, they are certainly losing money compared to working for someone else.",1390316464

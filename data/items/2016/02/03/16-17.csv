Memory safety vulnerabilities are far, far less common in Python (say) than Java. You may have <i>seen</i> buffer overflows in Java, but they&#x27;re extremely rare in comparison.<p>You&#x27;re falling to the &quot;black and white security&quot; fallacy: the belief that if you can&#x27;t solve a security problem 100% it&#x27;s not worth solving it at all. In reality, a 99% solution is extremely valuable and in fact almost always the best you can do.<p>> Moving to a safe language like Rust would help, absolutely, but to a far lesser degree than people hope. It would close far fewer cans of worms than the hive mind hopes, and it&#x27;s so new no one really knows how big its own can of worms is.<p>That&#x27;s very philosophical, but go look at the list of vulnerabilities.

11027472,comment,11020652,11025397,0,0,Animats,,,"Ouch. That was a decade late to be doing that.<p>I finished a MSCS in 1985. Ed Feigenbaum was still influential then, but it was getting embarrassing.  He&#x27;d been claiming that expert systems would yield strong AI Real Soon Now.  He wrote a book, &quot;The Fifth Generation&quot;, [1] which is a call to battle to win in AI. Against Japan, which at the time had a heavily funded effort to develop &quot;fifth generation computers&quot; that would run Prolog. (Anybody remember Prolog? Turbo Prolog?) He&#x27;d testified before Congress that the &quot;US would become an agrarian nation&quot; if Congress didn&#x27;t fund a big AI lab headed by him.<p>I&#x27;d already been doing programming proof of correctness work (I went to Stanford grad school from industry, not right out of college), and so I was already using theorem provers and aware of what you could and couldn&#x27;t do with inference engines. Some of the Stanford courses were just bad philosophy.  (One exam question: &quot;Does a rock have intentions?&quot;)<p>&quot;Expert systems&quot; turned out to just be another way of programming, and not a widely useful one.  Today, we&#x27;d call it a domain-specific programming language. It&#x27;s useful for some problems like troubleshooting and how-to guides, but you&#x27;re mostly just encoding a flowchart.  You get out what some human put in, no more.<p>One idea at the time was that if enough effort went into describing the real world in rules, AI would somehow emerge. The Cyc project[3] started to do this in 1984, struggling to encode common sense in predicate calculus. They&#x27;re still at it, at some low level of effort.[4] They tried to make it relevant to the &quot;semantic web&quot;, but that didn&#x27;t seem to result in much.<p>Stanford at one time offered a 5-year &quot;Knowledge Engineering&quot; degree.  This was to train people for the coming boom in expert systems, which would need people with both CS and psychology training. They would watch and learn how experts did things, as psychology researchers do, then manually codify that information into rules.[2]  I wonder what happened to those people.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Fifth-Generation-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/0201115190"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Fifth-Generation-Artificial-Intell...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://saltworks.stanford.edu/assets/gx753nb0607.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://saltworks.stanford.edu/assets/gx753nb0607.pdf</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/cycorp-ai-2014-7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/cycorp-ai-2014-7</a>",1454517804

Rude customers are nothing new. As somebody who worked as a tech support guy for a call center, for a major US computer company, if anything a rude customer was treated as a opportunity. I would receive any where between 10-12 extremely rude and inconsiderate calls. Many would be very intimidating. And a lot of times, I have managed to get them to understand our side of the story, followed up on their issues, taught them how to use the internet, worked with their ISP&#x27;s to fix their issues(sometimes people think, no internet is the computer&#x27;s problem, not ISP&#x27;s) and some times even given tuitions to customers on how to use their computers. None of that needed to be done, but doing it built very strong relationships.<p>I can&#x27;t even remember how many times our customer interaction coach would talk to us telling delighting a rude/irate/inconsiderate customer many a times mattered more than the very quality of the product. Because strong relationships bring people back, they help in word-of-mouth of marketing and helps build brand value.<p><i>You do not look at your customers as your enemy</i>. No matter who you are. Especially CEO&#x27;s need to realize this more.<p>Would you like to business with a company whose CEO/Employee(s) fights with its customers?

Short of a real eternal perspective and its aspirations (I&#x27;m a Mormon fwiw, aka member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), I wonder if in some scenarios this  could be addressed by replacing the vacuous money-driven consumer culture with a better kind of humanism, based on 1) very high expectation of honesty, 2) the Golden Rule, and 3) a plan for balanced personal growth/learning/service/mentoring as a substitute for extreme narrow pursuits (fitness or pleasure above all, for instance), as I briefly discuss at <a href=""http://www.onemodel.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onemodel.org</a> (under &quot;About OM&quot;, then &quot;Future...&quot;, then &quot;Maturity ...&quot;.",1454516883

Well... not quite passive, requires upfront time commitment of selecting links and locations.<p>* Hosting / simple websites.  Again, little bit of up-front commitment.  Works best if you can find a local niche of people who want a friendly face to host their websites.  Usually as simple as buying a domain, setting up WordPress, and turning on automatic updates.<p>In general, the best passive schemes require a large initial outlay and/or a dubious moral outlook.  A better way to enhance your income is to eat out less, stop buying stuff you don&#x27;t need, and shop around for deals. Boring but true!",1454516215

If it&#x27;s the hardware, it&#x27;s a general purpose computer that can run any software. We quickly go to a bad place if you can&#x27;t buy such a thing, e.g. side-loading on Android is <i>prohibited</i>, Raspberry Pi and RISC-V are <i>prohibited</i>, every device must prevent you from compiling a custom program and running it, etc.<p>But if it&#x27;s the software then you&#x27;re banning the publication of encryption code.<p>Obviously the confusion stems from Apple being the go-to example and Apple not only providing both the hardware and the software but also actually enforcing the kind of restrictions on what software the user can run that would be unreasonable as a requirement imposed by the government on the entire market. Apple could [try to] prevent you from using encryption software on an iPhone, but it makes little sense to require <i>only</i> them to do that if anyone can still run it on an Android phone or PC. But the alternative is that nobody can buy anything capable of running Debian or OpenBSD (or even Windows).<p>Moreover, the operation of the product is the thing carried out by the owner, not the manufacturer. Apple makes a nice machine and a big detailed list of things you can do with it but the user is the one choosing which buttons to press.<p>> As to your printing press hypothetical, I don&#x27;t think it applies. Say the back door is something like &quot;must keep the decryption key around in case a warrant comes in.&quot; That doesn&#x27;t entail any modification to the &quot;speech&quot; coming out of the device, does it? So how does it restrict speech?<p>So there are two questions here: One is, can I have the code that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> keep the encryption key? If not then it restricts the speech you can receive and that of other people who want to give you that code (perhaps so you can use it to communicate more sensitive information with them).<p>Then there is the key itself. Keeping the key (or sending it to Apple or Uncle Sam) is compelling speech. The key is also information and the key + ciphertext is equivalent to the plaintext. It&#x27;s equivalent to a requirement that you keep the plaintext of all your communications.<p>It would effectively be compelled written testimony before the fact. Either you keep everything written down or go to jail for not having it.",1454515538

The specific plane we&#x27;re discussing was used by the CIA, but by this point had been transferred to DOJ for some time.<p>It&#x27;s also misleading to use the word &quot;rendition&quot; as a shorthand for &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot; (which is itself newspeak for &quot;kidnapping&quot;). &quot;Rendition&quot; itself is simply the process of effectuating extradition. The term &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot; is doubly Orwellian, because &quot;rendition&quot; is the word for what a <i>host jurisdiction</i> does. A government cooperating in extradition <i>renders</i> subjects. The CIA <i>kidnapped</i> people, apparently without engaging any process of the host government.<p>To make matters worse, the CIA&#x27;s kidnapping program sent terrorism subjects to <i>foreign jurisdictions</i>, allegedly (and almost certainly) to enable them to be interrogated by the norms of countries that weren&#x27;t squeamish about coercive, torturous interrogations. The USG wanted Snowden back on US soil.<p>I suppose there&#x27;s a coherent argument to be made that the US should have destroyed the CIA&#x27;s torture charter jet, and that any further use of that particular piece of equipment is tainted by its history. To me, it&#x27;s just a plane, and if we&#x27;re going to do something drastic in response to the CIA&#x27;s complicity (and participation) in torture, that thing should probably be a series of criminal prosecutions.<p>Either way, the implication that Snowden was targeted for extrajudicial kidnapping isn&#x27;t supported by any evidence presented so far. So far, the facts we know about support a pretty boring narrative: the USG knew it was going to charge Snowden with crimes for which most of Europe would comply with extradition, and sent a DOJ plane to streamline that process.<p>It&#x27;s hard to blame media outlets for reporting like this, because the story of how we came to know that this particular plane had participated in the CIA&#x27;s kidnapping scheme makes for really good reading. But it&#x27;s still important to know the whole story.<p>And this particular headline is pretty silly. Scotland is part of the United Kingdom, proprietors of GCHQ, the west&#x27;s most unhinged signals intelligence agency. A DOJ plane flying over Scotland to fetch a SIGINT leaker isn&#x27;t particularly newsworthy.",1454515362

I, too, am seeing contradictions of the statistics in many tech workplaces (e.g. 4:1 CS graduation rate, or 99:1 OSS contribution rate, but 2:1 and 1:1 employment rates).<p>I&#x27;m confident that the cause of this discrimination is companies&#x27; very rational fear of sex discrimination lawsuits (which only women can successfully wage), and the resulting public-relations shitstorm that results from that (but only when a woman has something to complain about). Anyone following the tech industry&#x27;s news cycle over the past five years is familiar with this threat.<p>However, I object to your unease here at newspapers suggesting that there are differences between genders. There are obviously differences between genders -- biological and psychological.<p>The problem is that we have a culture that requires companies to take precautions (e.g. hiring less-abled women over better-abled men to meet lawyer-recommended quotas) to protect their interests; a culture that suppresses meaningful exploration of the differences between men and women (e.g. you&#x27;re only allowed to mention possible advantages that women have) and how to handle that.<p>Our culture is mandating equality in all regards, at all costs, and its enforcers will stop at nothing until that&#x27;s achieved. The reality is that, on average, certain demographics have innate advantages over others in a capitalist system. Gender can&#x27;t go away, so the <i>only</i> way to achieve equality in the face of gender differences is to wage cultural-level discrimination against the advantaged.<p>Our culture needs to change; it&#x27;s standing in the way of humanity reaching its greatest potential. I&#x27;m not sure how much further we can go while slitting our wrists at the altar of equality.<p>(new account because I would like to remain employed)",1454515215

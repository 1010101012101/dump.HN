Then he deleted his question and now I look like a douche.]<p>""Wrote"" my own over the last few days, but was told by fellow CL'ers it's already been done.<p>What I did was generate the database tables, the html form rendering code (each class as a form), the server side function to validate the form input along with the client-side input validating javascript. That is:<p><pre><code>  (defview user ()
    ((name :type string :display-info :text)
    (passwd :type string :display-info :password)))
</code></pre>
generates all of the following:<p>1) A CLSQL Object<-->RDBMS ORM thinggie. The class definition defines a table in the database (transparently), and each class instansiation creates a database record. You use (find-object :class 'user :id objec-id) to get it back; the code takes care of mapping a SQL select result-set to a single USER object or a list of objects.<p>2) It automatically generates DISPLAY-USER method for each class, which generates a semantically sane HTML form. For has id=""user_class"" and class=""defview"". You can customize the ""rendering"" of each class by customizing the unique element ID, or the whole set of generated views by customizing the CSS class.<p>3) It automatically generates the viewing page example.com/class-name, and it takes arguments as example.com/class-name/object-id. If not object ID is supplied you get an object <i>creation</i> form where all the editable slots are rendered.<p>4) It automatically generates example.com/class-name/validate, which is a server side script which you can use to validate the input of /class-name the creation method.<p>--<p>I have been on this fucker for the last 3 days and today I reverse engineered a whole site from a database of 34 tables. In ONE day. Took me two days to write the macro to do this, but I did it, and it's not pretty.<p>So far it jus supported html input types text and password, and textarea.

Because these architectures are shared-nothing between processes, they scale very well with multiple cores (as the author points out).  Furthermore, they're inherently more stable and have 'self-healing' properties (i.e. they can restart crashed processes; even device drivers).  But all of these benefits come at a performance cost because of the message-passing overhead.  Singularity and I think Midori try to mitigate this by a concept called software isolated processes (SIPs).

The strict ones are more approachable, but even an FP in its most primitive form, the untyped lambda calculus, is hard to reason about without some form of mathematical tools, at least enough to understand <i>efficient</i> implementation of recursion. (Anyone can implement recursion, even in assembly, but its consequences are far more reaching than just ""set base pointer to stack pointer, add sizeof(locals) to stack pointer, and jump to routine entry point""; that's why you have people like GvR struggling with it, 20+ years after the lambda papers.)<p>Type theory would send anyone insane; static typing is trivial when you have a set of ""primitive"" types and another ""derived"" types; neither C nor Pascal nor another Algol dialect <i>actually</i> implement proper types. C gives you a bag of bytes in the form of a struct, and pointer to that back; you create your data structures with that. ML dialects take type theory to fantastic extremes. Throw pattern matching into the mix and your <i>regular</i> compiler hacker is off to reading the semantics literature.<p>Reasoning about lazy evaluation is also not trivial. It doesn't even show up in the mainstream compiler literature, which, by the way, has always been about creating the fastest Fortran dialect. Compiler research IS Fortran research, while the PL research is mostly FP research (even if it masquarades as OOP sometimes, usually for grant and resume purposes.)<p>Logical languages also are beyond the reach of someone coming from a classic compiler hacking background. LPLs are so far out that not even mainstream PL enthusiasts grok them.<p>All is not lost, however. At least one language, Forth, is trivial to implement, and best learned by implementing it first, as much as it's difficult to reason about. The problem with Forth is that there is nothing magical going on; it's a simple and beautiful little perversion, something that could only come out of a mind untainted by theory. Ditto with Perl, though by no means pretty. Perl has the finger prints of a hobbyist all over it.",1247666520

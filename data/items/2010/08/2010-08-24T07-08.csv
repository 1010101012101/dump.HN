I'm a struggling single-founder, I've been working on my startup(s) and doing freelance web development (PHP/JS/HTML/CSS etc) since my former employer folded around a year ago. I've been able to find a steady stream of clients through friends, family and personal recommendations but I've pretty much exhausted this supply of customers and I'm starting to worry slightly. My main focus is my startup which I should be able to launch within a week or two, but there are of course no guarantees that it will succeed, or provide enough revenue to cover my living expenses, at least in the short term. So really my question is, how should I proceed from here? I have about enough money to cover my bills for the next 30 days, but that’s it and my partner is pregnant & due in October!<p>I’ve considered freelancing sites such as e-lance etc, but these sites take a while to establish reputation, so the route to success seems to be – spend a month or two doing lots of cheap jobs to establish reputation, then start going for the bigger fish. The problem is I’ve left it too late to pursue this route, I’ll run out of money too quickly. 
Yesterday the problem really hit home, so I spent 6hrs cold calling local businesses, just asking about their current websites or lack thereof, and although I got a few leads and some moderate interest (which I’ll follow up later), I’m not entirely encouraged.<p>I’ve reduced my outgoings as much as possible, but after a series of property maintenance nightmares (roofs leaking, boilers breaking etc) I have to pay a substantial amount in bills each month.
I’ve considered getting a job, but senior web dev positions are few and far between in my area and I’d still struggle to cover my bills<p>So HN, what do you think I should do?",1282635574

1629190,comment,1629110,1629110,0,0,btilly,,,"My advice about scalability for someone at your stage is to focus on making your data model clean and well-organized.  Try to avoid obvious mistakes (such as querying for the same data over and over again).  Make your code as clean as you can.<p>If you followed this advice, you shouldn't break until dozens of dynamic pages per second.  And then adding a caching layer like memcached for the most common queries should take you up into the hundreds.<p>At that point you need more scalability work, but should have the finances for it as well.  This would be a Good Problem to have.  Don't worry about it until you get there.<p>Incidentally the main reason to keep your data model clean is not to help scalability (though it does surprisingly well for scalability issues), but to make maintenance of your code easier.  Because as your vision of the product changes, you will find your code changing.  And a solid data layout will make that process easier.  (The end result is never ideal.

There is not a single dead link, and the image with the text is a reference to a server error, but clicking on the site goes to the live site.<p>There are 3 pages, with 9 live sites. There are many more, but not everybody decides to post their sites to the powered by section. We'll be starting a push to get NOLOH authors to post their sites there in the near future.<p>Furthermore, if you would've actually taken the time to read through our site, you would see that NOLOH does in fact render content without JS, if the developer chooses, which we're constantly improving. You can read our blog for more information.<p>It's somewhat shocking that this is what HN has come down to. Writing a reply without actually verifying your comment. I'm starting to think I don't belong here anymore, it's starting to feel like high school all over again.",1282633408

No, Public interest in research is what keeps funding higher.<p><pre><code>     Isn't that infringement of copyrights by the way? Do you think it is fine too if I start distributing freely an application for which you have worked for years and decided to charge for?</code></pre>

Researchers publishing papers dont earn a penny, the only thing that they get is free (no charge to researcher) dissemination. In fact a lot of researchers post a free version on there own web site.<p>I have published two papers in journal published by American Chemical Society and authors are allowed to put up pre-publication / non edited copy of their papers on their own website. ACS also provides a link from which upto 50 visitors can download the authors paper for free in first year and there is no limit after first year.<p>E.g. <a href=""http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/download.pl?ie0704647/P8Lu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/download.pl?ie0704647/P8Lu</a>
is free link to my first paper, the article is behind the firewall but if you use above link, you can get it for free.",1282633369

In my corporate career, I have seen too many of them talking abstractly about the product and hoping that the developers will magically figure out what needs to be done. After handing over a sketchy PRD, the job is done.  "" Drafting functional specs that range from whiteboard drawings to many-paged docs describing how things will work (totally depends on your ability to communicate, the team you work with, etc)"" - This is so important.",1282633323

As far as I can tell it has a pretty 'info graphic' interface, but doesn't really do the thing that would get me to use it: save money on flights.<p>Does hipmunk do anything different? It doesn't look like it can tap into sabre, ryan air db, etc, looks like it just scrapes and organizes, nor does it look like it has any fancy back end db of extensive flight info with a smart heuristics engine to predict future prices. So, beyond help those who have trouble visualizing a schedule, I'm not sure how this is any better than farecast et all. Can hipmunk predict if a particular flight's price (not willy nilly flights, I'm looking at you farecast) will go up or down?",1282633293

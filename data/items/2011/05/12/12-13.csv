2540398,comment,2539519,2539519,5,0,paulsingh,,,"I've built a few niche products and managed to try enough stuff to get some decent traction with two of them: notarycrm.com and mailfinch.com<p>tl;dr - if you're selling B2B, you're not going to get anywhere unless you can reasonably convince someone that you'll save them time, money or (ideally) both.<p>In general, I spent <i>a lot</i> of time cold calling the first users and gave away the product. There was a lot of back-and-forth about what sucked, what I had recently fixed, etc.<p>In both cases, the first users helped me understand quite a bit about how I was going to have to scale the sales operations... for example:<p>With MailFinch, one of my original assumptions was that real estate agents would want to use it to send out all the weekly flyers that they usually send out. So, I first asked all of my friends in the DC area to send me their local newspapers -- I spent a weekend circling all of the real estate ads that were larger than 1/2"" (if they're advertising in the newspaper, you can reasonably assume they have money and have some understanding of marketing). I then cold-called the hell out of these people and learned two things:<p>1. I was right -- they send an average of ~100 flyers each week.\n2. They would usually hand me off to their assistant (!!!)<p>That second item was important -- I didn't need to sell to the agent directly, I needed to call their office and talk to the assistant or office manager instead. I talk about this in detail in my Mixergy interview last year (which is now behind a paywall): <a href=""http://mixergy.com/mailfinch-paul-singh-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mixergy.com/mailfinch-paul-singh-interview/</a><p>With NotaryCRM, I actually convinced one notary (my mom) to start using it for her side work. Then got my wife to use it. Then one local notary that I cold called. From there, I learned pretty quick that notaries talk... a lot. If I had a bug, everyone started bitching simultaneously. As the product got better/prettier/more useful, everyone started loving it simultaneously.<p>The big breakthrough was realizing that there are two good channels to reach this market:<p>1. Cold call the notaries (there are huge directories for this now) and convince them to signup for a free account -- this is generally hard, but I did a lot of it early on.\n1a. Make sure you ask for referrals on each call, email, meeting, whatever -- ""do you know any other notaries that might find this useful?"" Notaries are regular people. And regular people want to seem ""in the know"" with their friends. If they loved NotaryCRM and referred it to their friends, they generally looked good. Totally serious about this. :)\n2. SEO works... especially in niches like this. Checkout notarycrm.com and click on the ""Find a Notary"" link. I could probably write a huge blogpost about this but the gist is that notaries are searching for their own name -- all the damn time. It also helps that they usually suck at SEO... so it didn't take long for me to put together a directory that came up at the top of the SERPs for their own name. Once they click through, there is a big call to action that says ""claim this account"" if they haven't already. Again, lots more I can say about this but it might be offtopic from your original question.<p>So... I hope that helps. :)",1305205036

Web applications, because they deal with a lot of text-manipulation and because they also deal with external data-sources and multiple layers, are the prime example for which dynamic typing works best.<p><pre><code>    Why do you say that optional static typing \n    introduced into dynamic languages is a divergence? \n</code></pre>\nIs not a divergence per-se, but the purpose of static types is to prove correctness of types from compile-time. Dynamic languages (as they are used) only need static types for performance reasons, that's why the optimal implementation will consider these types as hints and nothing else.<p><pre><code>     what part of OOP do you see as incompatible \n     with typing\n</code></pre>\nA static-typing system, to function properly, must be able to trace the true type of a variable throughout the code and be able to use that type at any given time in the compilation process.<p>In OOP you don't know the type of variables at any given time, you can only know its interface at most. And even that is incompatible with OOP, as OOP was also designed around the idea of overriding the method-dispatching being done (even in Java/Scala, all method-dispatching is done at runtime, as you're dispatching based on the implicit parameter).<p>For example, Scala cannot implement the HindleyMilner algorithm for type-inference, being forever forced to the current poor implementation that only deals with inferring the type of local variables.  And F# / Ocaml on the other hand really have 2 type-systems in a single language (to be able to keep Hidley-Milner , with rules for interoperability. And when working with one or the other, it's like working with different languages.<p>And the truth of the matter is, if you're watching closely, hybrid languages that are trying to combine static and dynamic really give you the worst of both worlds.",1305203279

Each client had his own queue and a single exchange was created for each room. Message came to N.js over a Websocket, from where it was pushed to a chat room's exchange with a temporary id. Next, message was posted to a Rails powered backend for processing and storing to a database. If Rails responded with success, a real message ID was pushed to the exchange, otherwise a command to kill message by temporary id was sent.<p>Given all this, I wasn't able to go beyond 2k simultaneous connections. Reasons? Our Rails setup wasn't able to handle that much requests.  For the sake of testing I wrote a synthetic tests where Rails requests were mocked. RabbitMQ was running on Thinkpad Edge  (quad core i5@2.6Ghz), node.js client and server was running on dual core pentium@3Ghz.\nThis configuration gave me 3.5-4.5 thousands of message deliveries per second, both PCs were at the top of capacity.\nSuch performance looked suspiciously low for me, so I went further. Reading node-amqp shown that it is totally flawed (i.e. it is allocating 130kb buffer for each message sent). Doing some tweaking I managed to increase message delivery rate to almost 15 thousands of messages/second.<p>Strange part of the outcome is that processing both 4k and 14k messages created almost identical load on RabbitMQ.<p>Lessons learnt:\n1. RabbitMQ is very robust and easy to work with.\n2. Do not measure RabbitMQ's performance by LA or CPU consumption. If you feel stuck, try optimizing something.\n3. V8 memory allocation/GC suck. My server was constantly crashing due to std::bad_alloc being thrown after next packet buffer allocation.\n4. node-amqp suck even more. I am going to work on it somewhen soon.\n5. Node.js on it's own is a toy, not a tool. Do not build mission critical systems designated to handle long living connections with it.",1305202437

As jasonkester said, wait at least a week before you start looking at proposals and making your decision. You get a lot of crap in the first few days, and you want to give the ""good"" people enough time to find and read it.<p>2. Be really clear and specific with your RFP. Go in into as much detail as possible, and look for responses that indicate that they have read it. Also, make sure you use a descriptive headline. You're competing with quite a few people, so you want your project to stand out.<p>3. Ask a few specific questions in your description. This is not only a great way to start to grasp their domain knowledge, but you also can filter out people who haven't read it (similar to #2).<p>4. When you have narrowed down your selection to 3 or 4, send them an even more detailed description of your project and arrange a Skype call. It's easy to be deceptive via email, but if you have someone on the phone you can quickly gauge how competent they are on the fly. Treat it like a real phone interview for a job you've had in the past, except you are the interviewer.<p>Good luck!",1305202092

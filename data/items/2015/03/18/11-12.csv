9224829,comment,9219162,9219916,0,0,Manishearth,,,"I agree.<p>Most devanagari glyphs don&#x27;t have their own codepoint. Marathi/Hindi/Sanskrit (which use devanagari) have a bunch of basic consonants and some vowels (which can appear independently or as modifiers). All the glyphs are logically formed by mixing the two, so the glyph for &quot;foo&quot; would be the consonant for &quot;f&quot;[1] plus the vowel modifier for &quot;oo&quot;. When typing this in Unicode, you would do the same, type फ then ू, creating फू.<p>It gets interesting when we get to consonant clusters. As mentioned in [1], the consonants have a schwa by default, so the consonant for s followed by the consonant for k with a vowel modifier for the &quot;y&quot; sound would not be &quot;sky&quot;, but instead something like &quot;səky&quot; (suh-ky).<p>So how do we write these? We can do this in two ways. One way is to use the no-vowel modifier, which looks like a straight tail[3] (on स, the consonant for &quot;s&quot;, or &quot;sə&quot;, the tail looks like स्), and follow that by the other consonant. So &quot;sky&quot; would be स् कै [2]. This method is rarely used, and the straight-tail is only used when you want to end a word with a consonant[4].<p>The more common way of doing multiple consonants are by using glyphs known as consonant clusters or conjuncts[5]. For &quot;sky&quot;, we get स्कै, which is a partial glyph for स stuck to the glyph for कै. For most clusters you can take the known &quot;partial&quot; form of the first glyph and stick it to the full form of the second glyph, but there are tons of exceptions, eg द+द=द्ध, ह+म=ह्म (the second character was broken), and whatnot. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari#Biconsonantal_conjuncts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari#Biconsonantal_conjun...</a> if you want a full table.<p>There aren&#x27;t individual Unicode codepoints for this, not even codepoints for the straight-tail form of the consonants. I typed स्कै as स्+कै which was itself typed as स + ् + क + ै. This isn&#x27;t an irregular occurrence either, consonant clusters (with a vowel modifier!) are pretty common in these languages[6].<p>I personally don&#x27;t see anything wrong with having to use combining characters to get a single glyph. If it&#x27;s possible and logical for it to be broken up that way, it&#x27;s fine. With this trick, it&#x27;s possible to represent Devanagari as a 128-codepoint block (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari_%28Unicode_block%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari_%28Unicode_block%29</a>), including a lot of the archaic stuff. It&#x27;s either that, or you make a characters for every combined glyph there is, which is a lot[7]. One could argue that things like o-umlaut get their own codepoint, but स्क doesn&#x27;t, but o-umlaut is one of maybe 10 such characters for a given European language, whereas स्क is one of around 700 (and that number is being conservative with the &quot;usefulness&quot; of the glyph, see [7]).<p>The article is never quite clear about which glyph Aditya finds lacking for his name (sadly, I don&#x27;t know Bengali so I can&#x27;t figure it out), but from the comments it seems like it it&#x27;s something which can be inputted in Unicode, just not as a single character. That&#x27;s okay, I guess. And if it&#x27;s not showing up properly, that&#x27;s a fault of the font. (And if it&#x27;s hard to input, a fault of the keyboard).<p>It becomes a Unicode problem when:<p>- There is no way to input the glyph as a set of unicode code points, or\n - The input method for the glyph as a set of unicode code points can also mean and look like something else given a context (fonts can only implement one, so it&#x27;s not fair to blame them)<p>[1]: well, fə, since the consonants are schwa&#x27;d by default. Pronounced &quot;fuh&quot; (ish)<p>[2]: the space is intentional here so that I can type this without it becoming something else, but in written form you wouldn&#x27;t have the space. Also it&#x27;s not exactly &quot;sky&quot;, but close enough.<p>[3]: called paimodi (&quot;broken foot&quot;) in Marathi<p>[4]: which is pretty rare in these languages. In some cases however, words that end with consonant-vowel combinations do get pronounced as if they end with a consonant (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa_deletion_in_Indo-Aryan_languages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa_deletion_in_Indo-Aryan_la...</a>), but they&#x27;re still written as if they ended with a vowel (this is true for my own name too, the schwa at the end is dropped). Generally words ending with consonants are only seen in onomatopoeia and whatnot.<p>[5]: called jodakshar (&quot;joined word&quot;) in Marathi<p>[6]: Almost as common as having two side by side consonants in English. We like vowels, so it&#x27;s a bit less common, but still common.<p>[7]: technically infinite, though that table of 700-odd biconsonantal conjuncts would contain all the common ones (assuming we still have the vowel modifying diacritics as separate codepoints), and adding a few triconsonantal conjuncts would represent almost all of what you need to write Marathi/Hindi/Sanskrit words. It wouldn&#x27;t let you represent all sounds though, unless you still have the  ् modifier, in which case why not just use that in the first place?",1426679973

That does not make sense to buy it as an investment.<p>300% is not unusual for a product when you consider everything between the raw material and the finished piece in a shop. For example, even for handmade piece, the jeweller will not start from raw gold, but from sheet or wire. The markup on those, out of the refinery is already 20 to 50% and he has not even started yet.<p>Jewellery has as much use as any other decorative item, buy them as such. You like the craft involved in making it, go to an artist a see him working days on your commissioned( * ) piece for an insane amount of money. You don&#x27;t care about the craft, just like the look - go for the cheapest possible that look good ( base metal plated, synthetic stones, machine made, ... ) \nAvoid anything in between IMO, to much of the value there comes from decades of marketing campaigns. If you like them anyway, go to auction ( not ebay, too expensive ) or second hand.<p>( * ) note that picking a stone and choosing a mount is not a commissioned piece - the jeweler will probably spend less than 1 hour working on your ring, half of that polishing it. It means going to an artist and picking a custom one of a kind design, with the majority of the work done by hand. i.e. Same difference between buying a limited print of a famous painting or go to a painter to have your family painted.

They are seriously outdated now.<p>And how does that affect their day-to-day usability?<p>I&#x27;m a big fan of new and shiny, but my primary laptop is a Dell Inspiron I bought in 2006/2007, because I&#x27;m also a big fan of using things until they break. I popped an SSD into it a couple years ago and it is very snappy and performs perfectly well as a development machine, web browser, and (small) VM host. In fact, it&#x27;s actually snappier than my i7 desktop for most tasks because of the SSD. So why would a secondhand (and probably newer) ThinkPad not be a suitable alternative?<p>The biggest downsides of having an older laptop are that the screen is a mere 1680x1050 and it&#x27;s pretty thick, probably a around a full inch when closed. The former is still not terrible by today&#x27;s standards (what&#x27;s with the absurd popularity of 1366x768?), but I do consider it to fall into the bare minimum of acceptability, and the latter is simply not a problem for me - it&#x27;s not enough weight to bother me on my daily 1.2 mile walk into work and most of the time it&#x27;s sitting on a desk or on my lap, not anywhere space-constrained.",1426679060

First, because it does not tackle the questions that hang over Berkshire’s conglomerate model and its durability. Second, because of the uncharacteristic coyness with which Mr Buffett and his partner Charlie Munger —respectively aged 84 and 91—discuss how or when they will give up their jobs.<p>Did this guy not read the letter? Because Buffet spends a lot of time discussing why he thinks <i>his version</i> of the conglomerate model works and will continue to work. You can disagree with his reasoning, but he certainly discusses it at length.<p>Second, there have been rumors that Buffet is planning to give up control soon, perhaps at this shareholder meeting. Even if he doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s not clear that it matters. The final word on asset allocation may come from him, but he is surrounded by people essentially making those decisions for him (as he basically implies in the letter).<p>Nowhere in this do I get the impression this guy actually read the FULL letter, beyond the first part (meaning beyond page 21).",1426677562

Well, our digital formats have a setting for how loud any given sound is, but you can&#x27;t just set it to the maximum value because then all sounds in your track will be equally loud. Or can you? Not all parts of a cymbal &quot;phish&quot; is equally loud, so setting it all to max will distort the sound (sacrifice dynamic range), but will consumers really care?<p>Youtube, by adjusting all tracks to have the same average loudness, is basically saying &quot;to those of you who would give up essential dynamic range, to purchase a little temporary loudness, you deserve neither dynamic range nor loudness&quot;<p>The hope is that eventually labels will quit sacrificing dynamic range for loudness if all our digital music sources set the average loudness to be the same for all tracks.",1426676961

But I don&#x27;t know for sure, and nowadays babies that would have simply died, or have killed the mother as well as died, can survive as a matter of course; so that changes the equation as well.<p>Breastfeeding (the first time around, especially) is quite a bit <i>harder</i> than most people realize -- it&#x27;s partly a process of teaching the newborn what to do.  They may be eager but default to a bad latch, they may be convinced their hand <i>also</i> needs to be in their mouth while they feed, or they may quickly pick up the habit of feeding for 20 seconds then taking a 2 minute nap, or they may decide they can only sleep while latched on.  And those are just the problems we saw with our own two daughters!<p>But it is worth <i>some</i> serious effort (even if just for convenience, once it&#x27;s working, among other benefits) -- it&#x27;s just not worth <i>destructive</i> effort, and if it doesn&#x27;t work out it&#x27;s not worth remorse.<p>> She&#x27;s also on the gifted and talented programme at her school now, so I don&#x27;t think Formula did her any harm.<p>Right -- it&#x27;s just so hard to predict.  She might have been breastfed and yet be having difficulty in school as well; there are so very many factors involved, but many parents fix on a few (and torment themselves with guilt, or pride themselves on a choice well-made...).<p>But there are so many paths to a happy & healthy child who grows up to be a happy & healthy adult, and so many that go elsewhere, and many factors are totally out of our control.",1426676569

You need good data structure literals, and to have two things with the same content be interchangeable, not just two objects that currently happen to have the same fields.<p>In other words, I think OOP and pattern matching are inherently antagonistic language features.

If it were true, you don't think the lawyers would have maybe mentioned this in court?<p>Bloch <i>used</i> the function in the course of implementing TimSort, but copied it directly from Sun's version of the Arrays class (it existed long before Bloch worked for Google).  And the reason he did that was because he thought TimSort was going to be contributed and added to Arrays, where it would have direct access (and the copying would at that point be removed).  That never happened, which lead to this count of infringement.<p>It's absolutely ridiculous though.  Even though they infringed the damages for that infringement should be about $100, which is the maximum amount you'd have to spend to reproduce that in a clean room.  Reimplementations of that method would look pretty much byte-code identical so Oracle really has no basis for seeking anything more than trivial damages.",1336654044

3953121,comment,3949489,3950246,2,0,dasil003,,,"I think people on HN complain way too much about Github's design.  Sure you can nitpick this stuff, but Github has always had above-average design.  Your comment about design-by-programmer is not really warranted in the context of the monstrosities that the term originally applied to.  If you want to hold Github to a higher standard because they have such a great product then fine, but there's no need to be so disparaging.<p>Github's design is not and has never been terrible.  And furthermore, hiring a ""real designer"" will not solve the problem because the core issue is that Github is a complex product; throwing a designer in there who doesn't understand the nuances of how git is used in the wild <i>is not going to help</i>.  There are many different audiences and many different conflicting problems to be solved.  The reason there's so much meta information stacked at the top is because the meta information is more commonly used then the file contents in most cases.  I agree it's not the most intuitive, but on the other hand there's not an obviously primary role for this page and things are reasonably well organized and delineated based on purpose.  I've used almost every single link there and there's not much that doesn't deserve to be front and center.<p>As for the icon redesign, they are trying to establish a visual language so that the masses of information they are publishing are more readily digestible.  This is not something that happens overnight, instead you have to use the icons for a while before they sink and start to pay dividends.  I'm not saying Github is successful, but I think people on HN and indeed the Internet in general are way to quick to criticize redesigns based on first impressions.",1336653500

3953119,comment,3952774,3952774,10,0,stutter,,,"You don't have comments on your blog, so I'll comment here:<p>IE testing is ""hard"" on a Mac because of the vm requirement, yes.  However, that's not even my main issue.  If Microsoft facilitated having VMs of each windows installation + browser version available for that OS to developers, it'd still be ""hard"" but at least they'd be helping.  IE only runs on Windows, so if you want to test for Windows you have a bunch of sub-par options, or really expensive options, or..illegal options, pick your poison.<p>That's not even my biggest complaint about it, though.  I have two main complaints.<p>First, the development tools available to Internet Explorer are absolute butt hole.  Javascript is considered a second class citizen, and is nearly impossible to debug efficiently.  The amount of ""oh lets try this for shits and giggles"" that is required, to see if it will fix a random IE issue is absolutely astounding.  I typically find my solutions to IE issues by complete accident, and upon reflection say to myself ""well..that's the most stupid thing I could have thought of - so no wonder that works.""  Not simple, stupid.<p>It feels like Microsoft deliberately takes the stance of making it HARD to develop software for Internet Explorer.  I don't know if this is purposely their philosophy but maybe they're diluted enough to think it helps turn out higher quality applications.  It doesn't, what it produces is a horrible user experience designed for the lowest-common denominator.  And the worst part about it is that most of your end-users use IE.  So, what it results in is crappy, old feeling, slow web applications and an influx of user complaints about things not working or taking too long (because the javascript engine is about as slow as the Ruby interpreter).<p>Second, the IE user base is so incredibly fragmented across versions.  And it's not like the difference between chrome 13 and chrome 18 where some css3 features don't work, or websockets is slow, or whatever.  The difference is that entire feature sets are missing, or work differently.  In one version CSS box width includes margin and in the next, it doesn't.  That's a pretty significant change; it completely ruins the entire flow of your site and you have to account for ""special"" cases of old browsers.  Except, your ""special cases"" of old browsers are 30% of the internet population.<p>Supporting IE is a time sink, but not just because it's ""hard"" to set up Windows environments, but because Microsoft actively tries to make it hard for developers to code, test, and debug applications in Internet Explorer.  Or doesn't make an effort to alleviate the pain; either way it's active effort in creating more suck, imo.<p>Disclaimers:  I've been developing on Mac for 4 years and haven't used Internet Explorer as an every-day browser in 7 years.  IE8 made some improvements to JS debugging (SOME) and is vastly better than 6 and 7.  IE9 might be amazing, and IE10 might be the best browser in the world - I don't know.  All I know is that debugging IE takes almost as long as building the application did in the first place.  Until that problem is solved, IE will still suck and still get a lot of hate from the development community.  Microsoft has a giant mountain to climb to get their reputation back to ""neutral"" in the web development community.",1336653460

There is (I guess) little scope for absolute user growth in the US, UK and European markets, in fact, its been suggested that user numbers are tailing off here.<p>Revenue per user: Given the constraints on users mentioned in the last paragraph it becomes really hard to increase your revenue per user.

The problem with good developers these days is that they have too high opportunity costs: a good developer earns as contracter easily between 130K und 180K USD, even more. Compared to a non-techie this is remarkable because there are many high priced offers in this range and developers don't need to present such a polished CV like their business counterparts (they can have white spots, breaks, stayed just few months somewhere, etc. and still get <i>easily</i> high paid dev jobs because of the shortage). And business people usually cannot do contracting work that easily.<p>This paired with a generally more risk-averse attitude leads to statements like ""If we fail fast you have lost almost nothing whereas I have lost months of intense work"".<p>I remember those days when I had a high salary plus a full packages of perksI was lethargic and haven't followed great biz opportunities because I thought they are too small and will never reach my current income.

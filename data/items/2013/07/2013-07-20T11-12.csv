This is on a fast SSD with 16Gb RAM but still the fluidity of workflows has improved a lot. For example I just created a JSF based Enterprise Java app and modify/rebuild/redeploy were pleasantly fast. So was the code completion. Got contextual help on CSS properties as well!

You would learn that actually free market economists do not belive that the market is this always stable thing that is pareto optimal.<p>It is actually discribed much more as a lagging, thing where there are forces pushing the markets in the right direction in the longer run.<p>Also if you for example look at public choice theory, that is economic analysis to democracy, you will see that just because the market is not stable does not mean you want the state to stabalize it. The state faces insentives that make unlikly to do the right thing, even if we know what that right thing is. There you have to problem that you often get unintended consequences, that is even if you assume that the state is all nice and only wants to help you, there is still a question if the have the knowlage and forsight to actually implment things correctly. So in the end it makes it very lickly that the intervention actually has negative consequences instead of positive ones.<p>So, next time please inform yourself befor attacking a groupe of on the basis of what you think they belive.<p>tl:dr; free market econmists are not as dumb as you think they are, they actually have spend the last 150 years thinking about these problems.",1374321481

When it sought a cable licence from the US Federal Communications Commission, the DoJ and the FBI insisted on a binding security agreement.<p>&quot;The contract does not authorise Telstra or law enforcement agencies to undertake surveillance. But under the deed, Telstra must preserve and &#x27;have the ability to provide&#x27; wire and electronic communications involving any customers who make any form of communication with a point of contact in the US, as well as &#x27;transactional data&#x27; and &#x27;call associated data&#x27; relating to such communications.&quot;<p>. . . .<p>&quot;The document was signed by Douglas Gration, a barrister who was then Telstra&#x27;s company secretary and official liaison for law enforcement and national security agencies.
&quot;He told the Herald he could not remember much about the agreement. &#x27;Every country has a regime for that lawful interception,&#x27; he said. &#x27;And Australia has got it as well.&#x27;&quot;<p>This looks like a pattern of mutual agreements among governments that cooperate in routing and connecting cables for international telecommunications. The statement is NOT that every telephone call from Australia to another country is listened to, but that a data archive is maintained that might be accessible with court orders. Particularly significant is the statement that other countries ask for the same arrangement if a cable connects to or through that country.<p>Switching email providers has little to do with what governments have access to your data by mutual agreements among the governments.",1374320845

It uses GADTs to represent the C type system in OCaml&#x27;s type system with as-you-would-expect OCaml signatures. For example, you can pass an OCaml comparator to a C sort function that takes a function pointer and it works.<p>It&#x27;s not quite as smooth, as far as I know, but it will soon include C header consumption and C stub generation to both improve binding accuracy/safety and remove dynamic paths for performance.",1374318287

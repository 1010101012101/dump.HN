Really.

One of them asked me, ""What do you like spending your time doing?"" To be honest, my favorite thing to do is be with other people. Or at least, the most rewarding and vivid memories I have were with others. Programming can very frequently turn into a solo journey that consumes hours of my time. It's fun, but also isolating.<p>If you limit your time with your computer (say, a max of 1.5 hours per day unless you're doing homework -- this will vary from person to person, but you have to be honest with yourself), you'll do more of what you <i>actually</i> enjoy doing while you're on a computer, and you'll also find opportunities to do more of what you enjoy off of it as well.<p>I surf Facebook less, I spend less time needlessly checking my email, and I only use HN or Reddit as a break from doing projects.

4216184,comment,4215118,4215118,34,0,maryrosecook,,,"Hi everyone. I'm Mary and I am making Isla.  It's exciting to see the language posted to HN, and great to see so much discussion.<p>I agree with the people who say that a programming language that apes natural language can be frustrating.  Inevitably, it cannot support even a fraction of the constructions that a human brain can parse.  What made me try a natural language approach is the following (contentious) ideas:<p>* Children find it hard to type punctuation.  Natural language can be parsed without punctuation.<p>* Someone new to programming probably knows nothing of conditionals, loops, logical operators and functions.  So, a language that codifies these concepts as jargon in the form of keywords is going to be alien.<p>* If you ruthlessly constrain the features of a natural language-like programming language, it's possible that you can keep the advantage of human readability and dodge the disadvantage of the ""uncanny valley"", as `antihero` succinctly put it.  In Isla, the only expressions are instantiations, assignments (with support for objects), `if this then that` style rules (maybe), and invocation of built in functions.<p>* The joy of programming is in building something.  To get children interested in programming, the language they use needs an application.  Children love telling stories, so why not make the application a story-telling environment? This gels nicely with the sparse feature set of the language: writing a story is mostly a matter of data definition.<p>This is the first programming language I have ever made.  All these ideas are theories.  Isla is just my first shot in the dark.",1341794311

If the result, that the marginal utility of a piece of chocolate a week later was less for people who had a lot of chocolate in between, surprised you, you've forgotten what marginal utility is. Do I need to really mention what's wrong with this comparison? Do people only enjoy chocolate on the weekend?<p>The children with goldfish: Imagine you earned a salary in NY strip steak as part of an experiment. Would you consider that experiment useful in drawing conclusions about money and utility or happiness?<p>The money in an envelope example: I'm not going to say anything about this, because I said in my intro that I'm going to ignore self-reporting bias caused by confronting someone about whether they acted ethically or not.

Coming up with the types on a function clarifies what it has to do and shrinks the space of possible solutions significantly.<p>Types are a symbolic way to reason about code. Using types, you can get additional insight into how your function can be written just by following some simple rules. A good example of this is realizing that a function you're working on is actually a specific version of a more general function--you can see this if the type signatures look similar. This lets you reuse very high-level, generic code easily.<p>Going back to the Prolog example, I was having some trouble figuring out how the resolution algorithm should work. Then I realized that the sub-part I was having problems with was just special type of fold. This helped me get a very concise version of the function by reusing an existing library function.<p>So types can provide exactly the same sort of benefits as TDD.",1341794104

The few administrative tasks and the chain-of-custody during letter creation is handled via randomized tokens and HMACs.<p>* I'm using redis heavily to cache pages (for 10 min) and the statistics. (Thanks antirez! I use it every chance I get.  It's a powerful hammer.)<p>* It's built in PHP using the Kohana 3 framework along with many plugins including mustache and modified SecurImage.<p>* I'm currently using MySQL geospacial searching for zipcodes, but am planning on taking the Census shapefiles and importing them into PostGIS and just migrating to Postgres for everything.  I haven't used Postgres yet, so it'll be a fun migration.<p>Any comments, questions, and/or critiques would be gladly accepted.",1341793461

4216155,comment,4213162,4215460,1,0,einhverfr,,,"Thank you for your thoughtful reply.<p>There is another possibility too that is worth considering.<p>Sexuality may be, for humans, primarily social in the same way it is for Bonobos.  Reproduction may simply be a functional necessity met as a side effect.  If we see sex as a social interaction and the choice of a sex partner as a social matter, then the question is how various individuals fit within social structures or not.<p>There may be in-born aspects to how people relate to social factors and for some people these are quite evident (autistic people, for example, relate to social structures very different from non-autistic people).  But even within the spectrum we might call ""normal"" (I don't like the idea of normal btw), there may be cognitive and even neurological reasons why some people may relate to specific social structures in specific ways.<p>However, beyond that, there are functionally necessary reasons why people <i>must</i> fit into social structures differently, and why at least some people <i>must</i> necessarily challenge and fall outside a social structure.  Every taboo in society <i>must</i> have someone who challenges it.  Every norm <i>must</i> have someone who falls outside it.<p>The reason is that without this process of perpetually challenging society, there are no individuals.  You can't be an individual and blindly follow social norms.  But beyond that perhaps on an evolutionary level, without people continually challenging, and redefining, social norms (a process which btw happens much faster in verbo-motor than literate societies), culture and society are static and dead and there is nothing to adapt it to the problems of the day.<p>So might be able to see various non-standard forms of sexuality (i.e. outside the social model of ""normal"" which in our society is defined by Barby and Ken, husband and wife, etc. i.e., monogamous and heterosexual), as necessary acts of rebellion which transform and breathe life into society.  The only problem is how some Christians relate to their myths of rebellion but that's a different topic.<p>In this way we can perhaps past the argument as to whether gays are defective people who can't help it and simply can't conform to models of normality, or whether they are immoral people who choose to live outside accepted social norms.<p>I don't think that sexuality can be reduced to applied neuroscience just as chemistry can't be reduced to applied quantum physics.",1341793371

I am only a mediocre player, but I'll play on a 9x9 board and hand out a 9 stone handicap.  More than half the time I'll win, then I'll give them a couple of tips.  (Unless you're connecting your stones in a solid wall, play 1 space away from me to avoid tactical tricks.  Also don't try to kill my stones, just try to build a wall that I can't get through.)  Then they usually win.<p>People often resist accepting the handicap.  So I point out that the game has a more complex strategy than anything they have ever seen.  The handicap is a necessary part of the game.  If they can't accept this fact, then they will never learn or enjoy the game.<p>Once they are beating me easily with a 9 stone handicap, we start dropping the handicap down one stone per game.  Somewhere about 5-6 stones they will hit a wall again.  Then I can give more tips and we go to the ""adjust the handicap after 3 victories in a row"".  Over time they start seeing more of what is going on.<p>Once they get down to a 3 stone handicap on a 9x9 board, then I give them a 9 stone handicap on a 13x13 board.  Now they can feel that they are really playing, and start to see how varied it is.<p>If you're trying to teach yourself, I recommend taking a game like GNU go and doing it yourself.  Crank up the handicap to 9 on a 9x9 board, and try to win.  Slowly drop the handicap.  If you can get someone to give you tips, do.

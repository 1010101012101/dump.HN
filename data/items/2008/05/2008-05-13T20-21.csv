Exactly what I was looking for (plus some) and I'm sure it will improve in upcoming iterations.<p>Any advice: which is better quality video Blip, Google Video or YouTube? In my mind YouTube is out of the question b/c of the limited upload size. Not good for hour long+ lectures.",1210712275

I took it to mean that if you really are a chronic procrastinator, you probably aren't going to end up in a position where you will need to be super-organized and disciplined. You may be the guy that develops that cool app that launches a start-up into success, but you probably won't end up as the CEO of the large company that is created as a result.<p>That's just my take, and I'm not speaking from a strong position of experience or anything, haha.",1210710755

It would appear that variance in arm count is 100% environmental, since the only people who don't have two arms lost one in an accident of some kind. Arm count is therefore not controlled by genes!",1210710141

188974,comment,188489,188682,0,0,emmett,,,"I agree that there is right and wrong, even though I'm not religious. I agree you can try to teach your children right and wrong. I disagree that just because you have good intentions and are trying to teach good values, that this means that what you are telling your children is truthful.<p>Most parents exaggerate the danger of sex, drugs (including alcohol), and video games (these have taken the place of rock and roll). There's a good reason for this - children probably wouldn't believe you if you said ""Well, these can be good in moderation, but you don't have the judgement to tell what moderation is yet."" So you might be lying with good intentions, and good effects, but you're still lying.<p>PS: I can understand how you'd feel attacked by someone implying a belief in God which you hold dear is equivalent to belief in the easter bunny. Instead, imagine that atheists see your belief in God as equivalent to belief in Ganesh, the Indian elephant god. If people tried to justify things in terms of the will of Ganesh, you would look at them somewhat strangely and would certainly not be swayed by their arguments. That's how atheists feel about your God: the way you feel about every other god but yours.",1210709698

9316591,comment,9315847,9316318,0,0,hippich,,,"There are different &quot;level&quot; frameworks are out there. Ember/Knockout/Angular gives you a lot of magic. Backbone - not so much.<p>Most concepts in Angular came from Spring Java (server-side, one request at a time,) which is absolutely unique to client-side frameworks world at this time. Reason behind this is very likely that Misko himself was server-side engineer at Sun before coming up with Angular, and he invented framework without working with other client-side frameworks, so he could not learn from their mistakes. So these specifics are not transferable to other client-side framework. Moreover - this knowledge likely will not be transferable to Angular 2.x too.",1428076792

BTW, the title is a bit misleading, in my opinion: handling paralelism at low level is hard, but parallel programing is hard only because of the languages we use are not transparent enough, and because many problems are hard to split in parallel tasks.",1428076784
9316589,comment,9316289,9316289,0,0,davismwfl,,,"In our experience, almost all the larger company deals come from a contact you already have or you network to get. Rarely does a cold email or call end up in a deal with a larger organization, although we have stumbled into them a few times.<p>The short version is that you need to target companies with specific demographics.  I&#x27;d say few companies really are &quot;setup&quot; to handle freelancers, but many businesses are setup to have solutions provided.  You get bigger deals by not being a team of freelancers and instead bringing solutions to problems.  Your goal is to take a part of a project or a whole project and develop it outside their team generally.  If you are integrated to their team and need to be in their daily stand ups or on site etc, you are just a contract employee which will not make you independent or allow you to take on other work easily and grow your business (see my last point below on this).<p>To your question how to get these deals.  Find ways to meet people in these companies, using your network of contacts, go to meet ups, conferences and basically stalk people that can help you get in the door.  You can cold call and send emails, this keeps your name around but just be careful not to be annoying.   We also research companies heavily to find out what their tech stack is, what issues they are having, who works there that we can target and try and offer free help in some cases.  For example, many times one of us will answer forum posts from a developer we have found works for the target company.  This is in fairness to help them out but importantly for us many times it then can help lead us to a foot in the door (we just made a new contact).  Without a big marketing budget it is all about creative ways to meet people at a distance and have them see you as a solution and expert that can help them.<p>IMO, focus on companies that have revenue of $3M-$10M annually at first, sometimes this is a guess obviously because they are private but rough head count and other details you find in the public domain can be used to estimate.  This generally gets you companies that are mature enough to understand they have to pay for quality and also small enough that they still need to outsource quite a bit of work to meet their goals.  Not only that, what we found is that by doing well for these types of companies, they will help you network to the next level up and so on (usually they will have mentors or contacts they are happy to introduce you too).  So over time you are working with as large of an organization as you like.<p>Personally, we have gone back to targeting businesses in the $10-50M in annual revenue (with most in the $10-25M), they are large enough to afford us, small enough we can meet all their legal requirements and generally low enough politics that we can get paid reasonably timely.  We have worked with Fortune 10 companies too, but the time requirements and reserve funds needed to service a client that is used to be waited on by everyone can be really tough when you are building yourself up.  They also generally have a great deal of cruft you have to work your way through and typically pay their bills very slowly, which again is tough when you don&#x27;t have significant reserves.  On this note too, the industry of the companies matters too, a $3m software company is way different then a $3m retail sales company.  You have to learn to tell the differences and what can be sold to each.<p>Last point, I know this is a touch off topic, but here is my simple way to figure out if a company is really trying to use us as a group of contract employee or a solutions provider, I just ask/answer some basic questions. If 1 or more are yes then they just want a contract employee which is not what we do.  Are they trying to manage our time? Do they want to set our working hours? Are they expecting exclusivity? Are they wanting to task my team individually? Are they wanting us on-site sitting in their building doing the work?  The last point does not include sales, demo, installation, integration or training type work.",1428076783

Just looking at a few emails we exchanged and thinking why I haven&#x27;t I reached the same level of success when I&#x27;ve had a ton of great serendipitous moments/opportunities to seize.<p>It all boils down to pretty much being a solo founder.  I always hired or found code monkeys to help turn my front end coded designs/ideas into a working product.  None of these coders cared the same 500% percent I do for my start-ups.  I.E. In December a Fortune 500 company wanted to become our client and I wanted to make this happen. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should make this company sign a licensing agreement or not.  An advisers said they should, though I wasn&#x27;t sure and wish I had a co-founder who cared as much as I do to discuss this decision with.  It was a turning point for my start-up and the deal ultimately fell through (crushing).<p>Having a team/co-founders that are vested the same 500% is utmost important.

9316581,comment,9315346,9315346,0,0,userbinator,,,"Interesting to see that &quot;slow dynamic programming&quot; which is the classic exchange-and-add algorithm is the fastest up to around n=126, at which point fast doubling with naive multiplication takes the lead, and Karatsuba multiplication needs n over 5000 before it becomes faster than the other methods. But, assuming that you can much more easily get an order of magnitude improvement out of the &quot;simple and slow&quot; method than the more complex ones, then the break-even point moves up to n=1260.<p>In other words, always choosing the asymptotically fastest (and often more complex - with larger constants) algorithms is a bad decision if most of your inputs never get large enough; simpler algorithms are good, even if they&#x27;re not the theoretically fastest, because they also tend to be easier to optimise.<p>However, the recursive algorithm being faster than slow-DP until n=5 is a little odd... some other effect could be responsible for that.",1428076741

9316574,comment,9315346,9316144,0,0,Chinjut,,,"The &quot;fast doubling&quot; approach IS the natural calculation in Q(sqrt(5)). That is, let φ^2 = φ + 1 (so φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2). Then (a + bφ)^2 = (a^2 + b^2) + (2ab + b^2)φ. Furthermore, (a + bφ) * φ = b + (a + b)φ. Finally, we have that φ^n = F(n - 1) + F(n)φ. Thus, we can extract the n-th Fibonacci number from the n-th power of φ, which we can compute in the form a + bφ by &quot;repeated squaring&quot; using the above rules, which is precisely what the &quot;repeated doubling&quot; approach of the linked-to page is effectively doing.<p>[Note that, by representing a + bφ in terms of its individual a and b components, we can just directly extract the components when we need them, instead of having to extract the coefficient of φ in x as (x - conj(x))/(φ - conj(φ)) [where conj(a + bφ) = a + b(1 - φ); note that this conjugation operator distributes across multiplication], which is what Binet&#x27;s formula does to extract the coefficient of φ in φ^n]",1428076704

To answer your specific question: I&#x27;m not sure. If a book about software architecture is going to look at two implementations - say, Audacity and Bash to take two examples from the first book - then it has to work very hard to find an architectural language that applies in common to both. If it does not, then all that has really been accomplished is to peel the onion on some interesting applications, and while that is valuable and makes for an enjoyable read, I don&#x27;t feel like it gets us any closer to actually understanding what the &quot;architecture&quot; of a software implementation is.

So, at the end of the day, these two pieces of code do the exact same thing, and have mostly the exact same meaning.  I read them almost identically...<p><i>Make a list of admins.  iterate through the users, if the user is an admin, append its name to the list of admins.</i><p>The unrolled version is a lot easier to modify later. What if you decide that each of these admin users should have a star next to their name? For the go code, you just add one line:<p><pre><code>    var admins []string
    for _, user := range users {
        if user.IsAdmin() {
            admins = append(admins, user.Name)
            user.Name = user.Name + &quot;*&quot;
        }
    }
</code></pre>
for the C# code, you either have to write a second LINQ query (and now you&#x27;re iterating the list twice unnecessarily), or you have to unroll it into a normal loop.<p>So now you&#x27;ve added complexity to the language that is only really good for saving carriage returns, and it makes your code harder to maintain.  Sure, it&#x27;s pretty and interesting from a programming theory POV... but at the end of the day,  I don&#x27;t get paid to write pretty or interesting code.

The future expected dividend payout of a stock is built in to the price of the stock on a continuous basis. Sure, you have to sign up for a brokerage account, but do you think the SEC is really going to let people buy and trade stock anonymously? You&#x27;re going to have to sign up for some sort of financially verified account even if Bitcoin is powering the transaction system. There will be money laundering laws that will require an institution to verify your identity and credit history (likely by signing your transaction, and by SEC/treasury rules that stock transactions are only legally binding if signed by a licensed identity verification service). The banks and government will never give up the control they have today, and there are ways of introducing such control into a blockchain-style system.<p>The parts of the financial services industry that can be automated are already automated. Financial services drives the bleeding edge of the technology industry - online banking has been a thing even before the Internet (you used to get a program on floppy from your bank and dial in to their systems through a modem). BTC (or rather, the blockchain) does have the capability to reduce the cost of this automation, but it&#x27;s already highly automated.<p>That 8% of GDP in financial services? It&#x27;s all salesmanship. In order to give someone a loan, you have to be able to sell that loan to an investor. The lower the rate you can convince your investors to take, the more margin you get to keep. Why does Goldman Sachs charge more to issue an IPO than other investment banks? Is it because they&#x27;re better at filing SEC paperwork? No, it&#x27;s because they can sell the IPO better by convincing investors of the growth potential of the company (the majority of IPOs are funded through large direct sales to institutional investors). I never said it was fair, but I don&#x27;t know that you can ever get rid of it entirely either (the US financial services industry also serves most of the rest of the world, which is why it&#x27;s so much larger than in other countries).<p>But bottom line, most people are not educated enough in finance to handle this stuff themselves without getting completely ripped off. That fact alone will support a very large, regulated financial services industry. That also precludes the utopian vision of many Bitcoin devotees - unless Grandma Nelly who works as a greeter at Wal-Mart can understand finance, you&#x27;re always going to have intermediaries. Because those intermediaries aren&#x27;t to be trusted, they will need to be regulated by the government.

Over-reliance on frameworks does create a dependency on the developers, they learn to implement their framework of choice instead of learning good software design.  And worse, this can foster the belief that frameworks are a necessity on every project.  When all you use is a hammer every problem looks like a nail.

A large open source framework will have implemented and fixed a ton of security blunders which you will not have. It doesn&#x27;t really matter how encyclopedic your knowledge of software architectural patterns is, even though design is important for system security, there is a large component that is case-by-case attack mitigation. Your almost always going to be better off with a security conscious framework than with an ad-hoc framework.<p>Another way to look at it is that every production framework needs a subset of its development team that is really knowledgeable and paranoid about security, proactively watches for new attacks, and which can very quickly roll out effective mitigations. If you don&#x27;t have at least one person on your team that will handle this role, then you&#x27;re better off using a security conscious framework, and if you only have one, then they&#x27;d better be very good.<p>Otherwise, sure, make your own framework to learn architectural principals, to improve your ability to digest the architecture of production frameworks, and to improve your ability to extend the framework into areas that are unique to your use case. Just keep it out of production.<p>[disclaimer to avoid discussion forks: for this comment, I&#x27;m assuming that the framework is being used for non-trivial systems, if what you&#x27;re doing is trivial, then you may not need a framework at all, bespoke or otherwise.

It is not just taking students outdoors - you can do high-quality Learning Expeditions that never leave the classroom. It&#x27;s the idea of taking a group farther than any one person could go on their own, by working with everyone&#x27;s strengths and by building the skills and knowledge required to reach the goal.<p>Quick example: I had a class conduct a population study of starfish at a local beach one spring. Lots of different work to focus on, allowing many students to address the variety of skills and understanding they needed to focus on. Plenty of coherence to make it easy, even fun, to manage the different work everyone was doing.<p>> I can believe that once the kids are in the mindset of following instructions they have a hard time switching to being more self-directed.<p>Yes. When students come into our school, many of them take 6-12 months to start taking ownership of their own work and their own learning. They&#x27;ve spent 8+ years being told what to do, and many have lost the ability to trust themselves to make meaningful decisions and follow through on those decisions.<p>> I would be really interested to hear more about the schools that run these types of programs too. The difference in class sizes and staff numbers, as well as the background of the students surely impact how easy it is to run a school in this way.<p>Class size is not as important as many think. 30+ is difficult, ~20 is quite manageable - in fact, having a diversity of skills and perspectives can be really helpful when you&#x27;re doing meaningful work. You might be surprised about how the background of students affects this kind of work. Students who have had behavioral issues in traditional models can often be redirected toward meaningful work - they&#x27;ve been behaving poorly because they want good education, by people who are willing and able to meet them where they&#x27;re at. These students are actually easier to work with in this model than students who have become overly compliant.",1428073846

I find that more unsettling since scanners/photocopiers are somewhat more specialist equipment today, whereas practically everyone has at least one camera.

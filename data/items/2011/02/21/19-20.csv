Or at least that's the term for when a contract is so abusive it is not valid.<p>The thing is that, as you say as I understand it, whether a contract is considered unconscionable is normally a complex question; for example, terms that are unconscious in a residential real estate contract can be included in a commercial real estate contract because a commercial renter is considered more sophisticated (and so if you rent commercially, you better be sophisticated and count your fingers after every hand shake). One guiding question is whether the signer really knows what he getting into.<p>By that token also, I believe a number of terms are considered unconscionable if you click through them on a website. I would speculate that if a vendor sent an actual devil who blew smoke out his ears and demanded a video-taped signing in blood celemony, that vendor would have a stronger claim that ""the signer knew exactly what he was getting into"".<p>Will Apple employ Devils in the future? I think Microsoft may have them all tied up...<p>IANAL of course...",1298318371

The dollar parity is forcing a lot of people to rethink the cheap labor approach, whether they like it or not.

Patents are awarded for long durations (20 years or more) because that is the time it used to take to extract value from them to justify the risk that the early stage innovators took and to reward them for their creativity.<p>But with the rapid speed of development in the technological sector such long durations of protection benefit the innovator disproportionately, to the detriment of society which would benefit once the patent was in the public domain.<p>I think that instead of arguing about whether software patents are valid or not, patent durations should be self-calibrating and should be tied to the time-scale of innovation in that sector.<p>So a software patents should for example be awarded for a duration of 2-3 years. This will still reward creative innovators, allow them to extract value from their work, without hampering further growth and innovation in the sector.",1298317954

It is about 6.5 feet (2 meters) across at its widest point. The frame is welded mild steel with riveted aluminum siding. It contains nearly 800 LEDs forming dozens of numeric displays spread across 14 control panels, each with an acrylic face laser-cut and etched with labels such as ""Lunar Distance"" and ""Hydraulic Pressure"". The pilot controls the rocket using a joystick and panels full of working switches, knobs and buttons. Underneath the capsule are three ""thrusters"" that shoot plumes of water and compressed air under the control of the pilot's joystick, simulating real positioning thrusters. Takeoff and docking sequences are augmented by a paint-shaker that simulates the vibration of a rocket engine. Sound effects complete the illusion, with a powered subwoofer that gives the rocket a satisfying rumble.<p>Behind the scenes, rocket operations are controlled by three Atmega328 microprocessors on custom-fabricated printed circuit boards, running a small operating system, RULOS, that they built just for this project. The processors communicate using an in-rocket TWI network and will eventually talk back to the house over a serial port. A trench running from the house to the rocket carries 12VDC power for the lighting and electronics, water for the thrusters, compressed air, and several data signals.<p>This isn't just a cool hack, it's a labor of love...",1298317620

I enjoy baking more than cooking meals, but I happily do both.<p>Simple delicious dish: carnitas.\nUse cheap pork shoulder (incidentally, the cheaper the cut of pork, the tastier!). Cut into 1"" cubes and drop into a pot and add enough water to cover. Squeeze half a lime and add some salt to taste. Bring to boil and skim off the yucky stuff floating on top. Partly cover and reduce to SLOW simmer and let all water boil off. You are causing most of the fat to render out of the meat. It should cook for at least an hour. When water's all gone and pork is starting to fry in it's own fat, add chilies, garlic, onion and maybe more lime juice. The meat will be falling-apart tender by this time and now crispy outside since it's been frying.<p>Eat as is, or add a cup of rice and let the rice partly fry in the oil, then add 2 cups water or veggie broth, achiote (cooked, crushed annato seeds), more onions and peas & carrots and cook until rice is done.

To summarize it in one phrase: communication overhead.<p>You need to educate technical writers and testers on what the system does, but this is the easy part - you also have to allow for a period of transition of organization to accommodate all the new folks, that means education of the original team who is probably already panicked and stressed out..<p>There are two ways you can go about it IMHO to prevent total loss - triage the features and roll the thing out ASAP. Or you could try to make the most of situation by indeed adding people - but not in parallel since this will only increase the confusion. I would assign apprentices to the original team and branch off later.<p>In a situation like this you have to accept that you have screwed up and that there are no short term solutions.

Making something as basic as making a Linux machine join a domain and authenticate against the DC work cost me a full weekend, and yet in the end I just had to give up.<p>I feel that your account of making a Linux machine play nicely with AD deserves a 'YMMV' addendum. In my experience it is not common that this should be so difficult to implement with a reasonably up-to-date Linux system. It also doesn't hurt to use a distribution that has undergone testing for this usage scenario, which is definitely true for the ""enterprise"" distros - both RHEL and SLES should give you very little trouble when it comes to joining a domain and authenticating against AD.

Let’s face it, without them TinyGrab just wouldn’t exist and none of us would be reading this right now; for this we’re incredibly indebted to them. The homebrew and independent app development community for OS X is wonderful and vibrant. It’s profitable and turns out amazingly good apps. Until iOS was on the scene I think it’s safe to say that the OS X development community was top dog. OS X users are also the most supportive when it comes to independent apps, unlike their Windows counterparts, they’re actually used to paying for software that doesn’t come in a box.<p>Right now we’re in a spot of bother. TinyGrab’s the strongest we’ve ever been. We have an incredibly tight and talented team and we’re getting ready to kick ass again, but we’ve just hit a major setback in the form of Apple’s new guidelines for subscriptions in iOS and OS X apps. As many of you know TinyGrab is actually a free app, our revenue model comes from selling premium accounts through our site. TinyGrab was one of the first apps around where you had to have an account in order to use the software. We prefer this method of buying software compared to pesky license keys for a couple of reasons. First of all it reduces piracy, you don’t get many people sharing their login details to an online service. The second reason being that you can take your TinyGrab account with you anywhere. Install the app on as many machines as you want, on as many platforms, all without additional cost. It’s fair on our users and also allows us to introduce a nifty little web based account system.<p>Apple would now like a slice of our pie, which is fair enough. We’re more than willing to give Apple a cut of the sales that they assist in, but we can’t. They simply won’t let us. Never mind the fact that 30% is a ridiculous amount to ask us to fork over, considering that we already pay $99 a year for the privilege to develop apps for the Mac App Store and a further $99 a year to develop apps for the iOS store. Never mind that Apple also get a cut of any revenue that we generate from selling our apps through their stores, they now want in on our account and subscription service. However by doing this they’ve just prevented and locked us out of ever being able to introduce the TinyGrab app into the Mac App Store, as well as not being able to ship updates to the TinyGrab iPhone app. Here’s why…<p>Remember that account system we sell via TinyGrab.com? Well if you’re a paying customer it actually unlocks features in the app which are closed off to free users. These are features like FTP uploads. Infringement Number 1:\n“Apps that unlock or enable additional features or functionality with mechanisms other than the App Store, except as approved in section 11.13, will be rejected”\nWe currently sell our accounts from TinyGrab.com through PayPal. We can’t actually use Apple’s In App Purchasing system because they won’t pass on a user’s data to us, they also prevent you from purchasing goods that exist outside of the app and the app store. So, for example, it prevents you from actually buying a TinyGrab account because the account is a real world purchase and doesn’t lay within the jurisdiction of Apple. Infringement Numbers 2 & 3.\n“Apps utilizing a system other than the In App Purchase API (IAP) to purchase content, functionality, or services in an app will be rejected”<p>“Apps using IAP to purchase physical goods or goods and services used outside of the application will be rejected”\nThe move to TinyGrab 2.0 will see accounts that expire after a limited time if you don’t renew your subscription. Infringement Number 4.<p>“Apps containing “rental” content or services that expire after a limited time will be rejected”\nAnd the final infringements are, of course, about the IAP revenue split.<p>“Apps that link to external mechanisms for purchasing content to be used in the app, such as a “buy” button that goes to a web site to purchase a digital book, will be rejected”<p>“Apps offering subscriptions must do so using IAP, Apple will share the same 70/30 revenue split with developers for these purchases, as set forth in the Developer Program License Agreement.”<p>You might think that these are simple issues to fix, but we can’t actually fix them all. We can’t provide a free TinyGrab version in the app store and then sell a version on our site, because you still require an account to login. Apple wants a slice of that pie and we can’t give it to them; in other words they’ve locked us out.<p>We really want to be part of the app revolution on OS X and iOS but it looks as though that may no longer be able to happen, until Apple fix these issues and welcome us in again. I’m sad to say that as of today we can no longer provide development support to iOS, officially, through the app store. Until Apple loosen up on their restrictions we’re ceasing all active development on TinyGrab for iPhone. Please don’t see this as a punishment, we hate to have to do this to our users, but we’ve been fenced out. Today I’m also having to announce that TinyGrab also won’t be seen in the Mac App Store. Unfortunately we can’t be a part of this wonderful purchasing platform for the same reasons that we can no longer officially support TinyGrab for iPhone.<p>Luckily for TinyGrab for Mac users we still have TinyGrab.com and Apple haven’t, yet, prevented anyone from downloading apps from the world wide web and installing them on their Macs without the Mac App Store. So we aren’t going anywhere just yet. In fact we’re even trying to get a stable version of TinyGrab 2.0 for Mac out this week.\nApple’s new stance on subscriptions and accounts in applications is incredibly disappointing. At the moment we’re working incredibly closely with Intel to get TinyGrab for Windows onto their AppUp store. Intel have been incredibly friendly and helpful, they currently don’t have a subscription model in place but still allow us to have our app on their store and sell TinyGrab accounts through our own site. When they introduce a subscription service we’ll more than happily switch our payment system over in order to give Intel their fair share of any sales we make. I’m incredibly happy to be working with a company that is actively encouraging and working closely with developers in order to get it right. Apple’s new greedy model doesn’t just affect the developers of applications, it also has a horrible adverse effect on end users.<p>We love all of our supporters and all of our users. Thank you for continuing to use TinyGrab and for being the best community we could ever hope for. We promise to keep developing the best simple and social screenshot sharing service for Mac, Windows and whatever new platforms tickle our fancy.<p>Chris Leydon<p>TinyGrab Project Manager.",1298316333

2246723,comment,2241638,2243315,0,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"Shockingly, I will try to explain how music works.  First I will explain the language of music that actually you already know quite well.  Second I will explain how art such as music can appeal strongly to people.  Third, I contrast with literary art.<p>Language of Music.<p>There is a 'language' in music.  Actually you must know a lot of the language quite well.  You learned the language if only because of the hours or so a day you have been exposed to music via TV, radio, movies, and more.  By hearing the music in this language, you have picked up the language.<p>In simple terms, the language has some sounds that correspond to and somehow express emotions.  That is, for each common emotion, there are some sounds that express it.  For the common emotions, people know some corresponding sounds very well.<p>To get started with the language, play something just one note at a time on just the white keys on a piano.  Start on C, play some other notes, and end on C. Then what you will hear is that some emotional experience starts, continues, evolves, and develops, and then ends.<p>Why do you hear this?  Because starting on C and playing just on the white keys you will hear that the music is just in the key of C major.  You know the key of C major very well, will know that the music is all in C major, and will recognize when the music gets back to C and seems to end.  Indeed, in much early music, it gets back to C too often and sounds boring and then, from hitting C too often, irritating.  That is, each time the music hits C it seems to stop; so, each few notes the music seems to stop, and that's about as much fun as a car that goes down a road but stops each few feet.  Why did the music return to C so often?  Because the composer was not very good and couldn't think of anything better to do.<p>So, start on C, go through this and that, and end on C. Due to the language you have learned, the return to C sounds like the music 'resolves'.<p>Then for the goes through this and that, if get away from the white keys, then things sound different.  Why?  Because your ear has been very well trained to hear leaving C major.  Leaving C major can add variety to the this and that in the middle.  So, when you get back to C, the resolution feels stronger.<p>For more in the language, playing more than one note at a time is 'polyphony' and offers a stronger beginning than just C itself, more variety during the this and that, and stronger resolution as we end.  You have already learned these things as you learned the language.<p>The variety of polyphony is large and permits sounds that are fairly clearly like anger, frustration, happiness, tension, anticipation, and, of course, resolution.<p>E.g., if play two notes together that are close in frequency, then the sound is harsh and strident.  So, the sound can represent anger, tension, or danger.  You won't miss this part of the language for even an instant.<p>E.g., for anticipation, the note one lower than C is B, and it is in frequency close to C, that is, only a semi-tone lower.  When the music plays B, you anticipate, correctly from the thousands of hours of music you have heard, that next the music will play C and 'resolve'.  If the composer does not play C next, then he can delay the 'resolution' and keep you 'hanging' and strongly continue the this and that part.  Actually, you know this very well.  So here is some musical language you understand for 'anticipation'.<p>Then for Exercise 1 in Composition 101 to create some extended musical experience, start with something with a little tension, add this and that with a lot of tension, anticipation, etc., and then resolve and end.<p>There's some advertising music that does this effectively in just 21 notes:  To be more explicit, as you play on the white keys, starting at C and going up (in frequency, to the right) you will play D, E, F, G, A, B, C -- easy enough to remember.<p>Well the first seven notes are C, D, E, C, D, B, C. I will put after each note the number of beats:<p>C 1, D 1, E 3, C 1, D 3, B 1, C 3.<p>Wonder of wonder, for some music trying to sell soap or some such to millions of TV viewers, it starts on C, uses just four notes, and ends on C. We're talking really simple musical language here:  Anyone who doesn't know that much musical language won't have money enough to buy the soap anyway!<p>Then next seven notes are<p>D 1, E 1, F 3, G 1, E 3. F 1, D 3<p>So, these seven notes are much the same as the first seven except start just one note higher, on D instead of C. So, starting higher, there sense is that something has progressed.  Since these seven notes do not end on C, the music seems not to be over and the viewer is left hanging, that is, listening for more, just as the advertiser wants.<p>The last seven notes are just the same as the first seven and end on C just as the ad ends thus resolving the music.<p>There is a little more:  In the first and last seven notes,<p>C 1, D 1, E 3, C 1, D 3, B 1, C 3.<p>the first two notes are short and, thus, rise quickly; this is as if something was starting and helps get the attention of the viewer.  The next three notes sound like a sigh and make the viewer comforted and more relaxed.  The last two notes return to C with a nice resolution, especially since the B lets the viewer anticipate the C and, thus, follow along.  All in just seven notes.<p>Hearing this you wouldn't miss the musical language.<p>A good musician with even just a violin, can add other elements of musical language, you readily recognize, with loudness, vibrato, brightness, harshness (press harder with the bow and play closer to the bridge), urgency (play faster and start notes suddenly instead of gradually), etc.  Net, a good violinist can use musical language elements you already know well and, thus, be very 'expressive'.<p>For larger collections of instruments, can get much more in variety that can represent other emotions.  Some of these representations are widely and clearly understood, and some, say, from some new music, are not.  So, yes, there is a musical language, and some of it is widely understood and some is not.<p>In the end, in my view, classical, non-programmatic music is not so difficult to describe:  The musician has an emotional experience that goes through various cases of this and that.  So, he writes some music that roughly represents that.<p>If the music is 'good', then it is 'general' (sometimes people say 'universal'), that is, does well representing more emotional experiences than just the one the musician had and for many listeners seems to represent an emotional experience they have had, likely different experiences for different listeners.<p>One of the better approaches to reaching many listeners is to represent a person's yearning, typically for emotional security, and then struggle against obstacles with lots of variety during the struggle and finally resolution or victory.  That is, everyone want emotional security, and nearly everyone has had struggles and pursued them with energy, frustration, anticipation, success, setbacks, etc.<p>My favorite example of such music is the solo violin piece the Bach 'Chaconne'.<p>The Appeal of Art and Music.<p>There is a fact about people and art:  If people see some of their stronger emotions about some of their experiences displayed in front of them, then they like it, maybe because it confirms to them that they are not alone in such emotions.  E.g., it can be that all 1000 people in the concert hall have had similar emotions.<p>People can also like music that displays emotions about experiences they have not had but would like to.<p>In movies, the effect is more particular:  The music can combine with the film to suggest the intended emotion and, thus, make it easier for a viewer to 'get' what more specific emotional experience is intended to be communicated.  E.g., in 'Star Wars', the 'Imperial March' clearly represents some power obsessed, brutal, militarism; a viewer can get that message from the music right away although just from the story it takes longer!  That's part of why John Williams got paid the big bucks!<p>Tough to listen to the Brahms 'Lullaby' and not get the feeling of a mother's love for her child:  There is a lot of gentle stroking and comforting sighing in that music!  Similarly for 'Silent Night' which I caught on to well at about the age of three.<p>Tough to listen to the beginning of Beethoven's 5th symphony and not get that 'there's heavy stuff going down'.  Lots of people have experienced heavy stuff.<p>Tough to listen to the Beethoven 6th symphony and not feel something like seeing a pastoral scene, say, a meadow with a stream flowing through it if only because this is programmatic music complete with bird calls.<p>So, programmatic music is a two edged sword:  First, due to the program, it is easier to understand.  Second, due again to the program, it is less general so that listeners who have not had, or don't want to have, the experience of the program won't like the music.<p>I know; I know; you had music lessons in the fourth grade, and the teacher told you none of this.  Sorry 'bout that!<p>Literary Art.<p>For literary art, for me it is too specific:  For the situations and corresponding emotions being presented, mostly I have not been in such a situation and even when I have very much both my thinking and emotions were very different.",1298315834

2246663,comment,2246044,2246044,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>Can you imagine asking the surgeon: “What is a scalpel? What kind of scalpels are there? Now, cut this cadaver as if you were to perform an appendectomy. Good. Now imagine that there were some complications–show how you’d cut in that case.” I hope you are having a good laugh, because such a situation is unimaginable.</i><p>Not unimaginable at all. In a world where surgery was run like software ""engineering"" [1], we would interview surgeons this way.<p>Why don't we interview surgeons this way?<p>(a) Because surgical training is via apprenticeship. For any given surgeon, you can ask ""which group of other surgeons taught you everything you know? Which ones signed sworn statements that you are minimally competent?"" Then you can find those senior surgeons and ask them candid questions about the candidate. This is <i>always</i> possible. If a surgeon turns up without such references they don't get as far as an interview. (""I taught myself surgery from blog posts, and I practiced on my cats?"" Eeeek. NO HIRE.)<p>(b) Thanks to the long history of medicine and its very serious life-and-death implications, surgery is a very thoroughly attested event with a very definite chain of responsibility. Look at a hospital's records for a given surgery, and you will get a complete list of everyone in the room. If the surgeon was the only surgeon in the room, you can be fairly confident that they handled the operation themselves. And though I'm not sure there's an actual <i>law</i> that forbids a surgeon from handing the scalpel to a nurse, or an intern, and having them do everything, that would (a) not be something they could do in secret; everyone in the room would know and (b) the surgeon-of-record would still be the responsible party: If something went wrong in surgery guess who would be sued?<p>What I'm saying is: It is hard to bluff being a surgeon. Which is not to say it doesn't happen: For various all-too-human reasons, doctors and nurses do cover for each other, and scandals occur. But it's not like software, where the level of bluff is really, really large. Software ""engineers"" are often self-taught by necessity, especially in the tasks they actually do all day; their work has no legally defined standards or practices; there are so many ways to solve a given problem that two engineers with the same job title and official responsibility may have <i>completely different</i> skillsets; they work largely inside their own heads where nobody can see what is going on; they can very easily copy others' work, or sit in the corner while the rest of the team does the heavy lifting and then claim full credit.<p>---<p>[1] For this post, I'm going to use these scare quotes to distinguish ""software engineers"" like myself from actual Professional Engineers, who <i>are</i> like surgeons and are not, in fact, asked to build little bridges out of Lego bricks during their job interviews.",1298314980

Sure, you can buy cheap value-brand staples that are probably chock full of preservatives and chemicals that drive down the cost of food on an industrial scale. You can also buy furniture from Wal-Mart that's made compressed sawdust, a binding agent and a thin coat of paint. Both purchases will be relatively cheap, but I wouldn't expect anything more than minimal quality from either.<p>Over the last 10 years, I've seen a relative explosion of organic and locally-grown food at mainstream grocery stores. I haven't lived in particularly liberal areas, so I think it's safe to say that these are representative of a growing trend of consumer consciousness. People seem to give a damn what their money is really buying in a way that they didn't 20 years ago, for instance. Simple economics suggests that labor will expand to fill this niche, and in doing so, that expansion is going to run counter to the author's main point that efficiency is inexorably shrinking the workforce.<p>I'm not saying this is wrong, but I'm curious what this niche market for higher-quality, locally manufactured/grown goods means for the trend the author is trying to forecast.",1298314828

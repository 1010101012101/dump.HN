Its like a dead-lock situation&quot;<p>Nowadays, whenever a programmer says this a cat dies in the other side of the world. We developers are almost immune to this, because we have what we call open source software and free cloud services doing very specialized tasks. What I mean to say is that if experience is your problem, you should be glad to know that there are ways to gain experience without a job. This is quite easy to do in our field - contribute to open source, do some personal projects for portfolio, or even help out some startup in need of manpower. All these things can be done right now, and reaching out to HN is a good start. Relax, my friend.

Zuck can be a nice person to many people, but also can be an asshole to people who he thinks are not useful to him and who are wasting his time.<p>It goes the other way too. Paul Graham compares founders to internet trolls. I know someone in real life, who got banned from this forum and real life events due to trolling and hurling insults. That person is quite nice in real life (or, at least he is nice around me). In many cases the troll on the internet is the person who in real life has to always bite their tongue and say the nice thing, trolling on the internet is the one place where they can be the Steve Jobs asshole and not suffer consequences.<p>PG is a millionaire investor. I can readily believe that any founder who cannot shield their mean and ruthless streak from PG, would not be a good founder. Successful people are very adept at knowing when to work the charm, and when to be ruthless, knowing when they have to hold their tongue, and when they can speak their mind without consequences.<p>I&#x27;m trying to think of what evidence would convince me that founders were actually less mean than your average high-level person in some other industry. I think you would need to do a series of private interviews with their subordinates and ask questions about how often they get berated or screwed over.<p>I&#x27;d also be interested in hearing the experience of anyone who has switched from being mid-level in finance to mid-level in tech. Is there really a difference in &quot;meanness&quot;? PG cites Jessica&#x27;s experience, but she was switching to a position in tech where she had the position of dominance over the founders, so she always seeing their good side.<p>It has been my experience that the people at the top in tech generally have a ruthless streak. Tech founders and execs are more ruthless/situationally mean than the people at the bottom. The founders have the ability to turn a switch and treat employees as tools, rather than people. This may be necessary if you have to fire people and make other hard decisions. I do not think that this ruthless streak is necessarily a bad thing.<p><i>&quot;There is also a complementary force at work: if you want to build great things, it helps to be driven by a spirit of benevolence...They may not say so explicitly, but they&#x27;re usually trying to improve the world.&quot;</i><p>Keep in mind that a desire &quot;to improve world&quot; is a synonym for a &quot;lust for power.&quot;  The first is a positive way of putting it, the second is a pejorative, but it is the same thing. A neutral phrasing is that founders &quot;desire influence&quot;. Founders hold on to their startup rather than selling because they like being in the thick of things, having attention, being able to shape and move a service that millions of people use, and have an impact on tens of millions of people. This desire for influence is not at all incompatible with being an asshole to people who are not useful or who are in the way.<p><i>&quot;Another reason mean founders lose is that they can&#x27;t get the best people to work for them.&quot;</i><p>Anyone who is mean all the time will certainly fail. Who are these people though? Most people who are indiscriminately cruel are probably also low IQ (they are not even smart enough to manipulate) and max out at being a sales manager for Dundler-Mifflin.<p>All things being equal, an employee would rather work for a nice boss than a mean boss. But employees also want to work for a winner, and will often accept a boss with a mean streak as a trade-off in order to work for a winner.<p>&quot;<i>Increasingly you win not by fighting to get control of a scarce resource, but by having new ideas and building new things.</i>&quot;<p>The &quot;but&quot; should be an &quot;and&quot;. The &quot;scarce resources&quot; are market opportunities for capturing a lucrative monopoly with only minimal upfront costs. Based on the underlying state of technology, there are only so many opportunities for a small team of hackers to build simple apps that can gain traction and turn into wildly successful products.<p>Startups also require a large amount of hustling. You have to convince a lot of people to bet on you before there is solid evidence that you have a great product. The amount of hustling, salesmanship, confidence games, self-promotion, &quot;naughtiness&quot;, that can be required would make a lot of us hackers feel very uncomfortable. So while there is a selection for makers, there is also a selection for people who have a fair amount of narcissism and who are comfortable pushing ethical boundaries.<p>It might be that YC is particularly good at picking and accelerating startups based on having founders who are great makers rather than great sellers. This really would generate a better class of founder, and would make their startups more ethical and less mean than the typical VC backed startup. If this is the case, then kudos to YC.",1417278490

The number of historical figures to pick from is much larger, and so you&#x27;d be able to pick out more people with virtually any characteristic you care to name from the larger pool.<p>In my limited world view, mean people often win. Mean police win. Mean politicians (like Putin) win. Mean business people like Steve Jobs, Donald Trump and Larry Ellison win.<p>No-one likes to be the target of meanness because it is a kind of psychic assault, an expression of derision or hatred or contempt.

Founders are (should be) more inclined to think about win-win solutions so that the adoption is high. Secondly, compared to the corporate world, in a startup the focus in on creating value, versus protecting positions and internal politics. On the other side, public profiling and feedback incentivize founders to be at least careful about how they reflect to the world.

Ship a lot of code out onto the internet for the world to see.<p>There are several purposes:<p>1) Building a lot of things will hopefully help you uncover different problems that you will have to struggle to solve. Hopefully after struggling to solve them, you will gain understanding.  Just following hello worlds doesn&#x27;t really help much. But when you&#x27;re trying to figure out how to implement a &quot;real-world&quot; product problem, you&#x27;ll have to figure out how to develop features that don&#x27;t come for free with whatever framework you are using.<p>2) Also, don&#x27;t write everything from scratch. Research what frameworks or libraries might help accelerate your development. Understand the pros and cons of using them.<p>3) Hopefully as you build more things, they will get better. And then you will have something to showcase to prospective employers. You&#x27;ll have real code you can share with them. Be humble, get pointers on how you can improve.  Bonus points if you have tests too.<p>4) It shows initiative and interest. I&#x27;d imagine these are important intangibles. I&#x27;d be very reluctant to hire an engineer who didn&#x27;t tinker with things at night. (not necessarily all night, every night.)<p>5) Additionally, taking vague concepts and requirements and turning them into products does take some discipline. Which features will you keep, which features will you cut. How can you change your requirements and still get what you want. It shows that you can do things without being told exactly what to do, or how to do it.<p>Hope this helps.",1417278057

A such simple thing like authorization took a day or two to implement, solution looked like a one big hack.<p>However some SPA/Angular features worked beautiful. Two way data binding and local templates allow to build complex forms very easy. Data validation of one to many associations was straightforward. In Rails we have to use accepts_nested_attributes_for. It is so &#x27;nice&#x27; that some people want to move nested attributes functionality to an external gem.<p>The biggest thing Rails is missing: components. There is a discussion today on HN [1] about this. Angular, web components, HTTP2 might really allow to build real object oriented web apps. In Rails there is a view.erb file and that&#x27;s it [2].<p>I guess that competition will force developers to build even more user friendly and responsive apps. By that I mean no more separate pages to add a simple record. New apps will allow to click on a record, edit it in place and save with enter.

This sounds clinched, but what I mean that you should do is dare to take on more responsibility.<p>Presumably you don&#x27;t advertise yourself as &#x27;experienced&#x27; when applying for the job openings because you feel you won&#x27;t be able to add value the the company you&#x27;re applying to. I presume you don&#x27;t trust yourself to be able to complete the tasks the company will ask of you and that you refuse to have the company lose money because of you.<p>The solution, in my opinion, is to inflate instead of deflate what you&#x27;ve done. Even if you yourself don&#x27;t believe it amounted to much: having &#x27;built a custom cms&#x27; on your cv will, if phrased the right way, sound like &#x27;experience&#x27; to potential employers. You&#x27;re not lying when you do this. You _have_ built that CMS, and even if it seemed simple it still counts for something.<p>I can honestly say that I&#x27;ve written accounting software for the marketing department of a certain company. On my cv this sounds impressive, and I&#x27;ve actually done it. In reality it came down to 500 lines of (very ugly)VBAv6 code in excel. Do I think it&#x27;s the best work I&#x27;ve ever done? No, but I did do it.<p>Next, perhaps you don&#x27;t realize this, but after a certain point the language you program in matters less and less. You see what&#x27;s important in programming is not the languages that you know but the paradigms that you&#x27;ve mastered and the intuition you develop for doing things in a certain way. In C# you&#x27;ve learned object oriented programming. This experience is much more valualbe to you than knowledge of C# itself. With you having played around in Java, C#, Phyton it sounds to me that you&#x27;ve sampled allot of different ways of getting stuff done with programming.<p>And you do _know_ this, even if it seems so simple to you, putting on your cv &#x27;two years experience with OOP&#x27; is true and a valid way of advertising yourself. Allow yourself to advertise the &#x27;generic&#x27; programming skills you&#x27;ve learned with C# when applying for openings that require Java. You&#x27;re not lying, and you&#x27;ll see that you can live up to the challenges your future employer has in store for you.<p>When I wrote that VBA application I hadn&#x27;t written a single line of VBA in my entire life, and while the source is a mess (I don&#x27;t envy the person who needs to fix something in the future...) the program does work.<p>You _must_ trust yourself to be able to tackle the problems that could be thrown your way by your employer.

You can use it in scripts to automate stuff, too.<p>My most commonly used command sequence:<p>$  pockyt get -n 10 -q &#x27;ycombinator&#x27; -f &#x27;{id}&#x27; -o browser | pockyt mod -d -i redirect<p>This lets me open the 10 latest pocketed ycombinator links in my browser, and then deletes them from my pocket collection.",1417277159

Look, lots of worthwhile work happens in .net, and in Java, and in Python, and even in older languages. When the technology in a stack has inconvenient or irritating aspects, that&#x27;s a big opportunity: if you&#x27;re good at dealing with that stuff, you&#x27;re valuable.<p>What counts? Getting stuff done, not indentation styles.<p>If you don&#x27;t know SQL, now, while you&#x27;re looking for work, is the time to learn it. Give yourself the assignment of building a program and maybe a web site to browse some kind of open data. (Historical weather measurements? Nursing home quality scores? Political donations?

8674061,comment,8671287,8672072,0,0,ircmaxell,,,"So, I tried this in the past.<p>The problem you&#x27;ll run into with PHP specifically is that reading an undefined string offset (past the end) will result in a notice: <a href=""http://3v4l.org/nIkf5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://3v4l.org/nIkf5</a><p>Which means that errors are triggered. So you can increase the length of the user string and note a linear increase in runtime until you increase it past the length of the string, at which point it becomes MUCH slower on a per-character basis (even if you don&#x27;t do anything with the notice, the error mechanism is still triggered internally, which isn&#x27;t cheap).<p>Actually, my original code was more robust as it never read past the end of the string, preventing the notice:<p><pre><code>    /**\n     * A timing safe equals comparison\n     *\n     * To prevent leaking length information, it is important\n     * that user input is always used as the second parameter.\n     *\n     * @param string $safe The internal (safe) value to be checked\n     * @param string $user The user submitted (unsafe) value\n     *\n     * @return boolean True if the two strings are identical.\n     */\n    function timingSafeEquals($safe, $user) {\n        // Prevent issues if string length is 0\n        $safe .= chr(0);\n        $user .= chr(0);\n\n        $safeLen = strlen($safe);\n        $userLen = strlen($user);\n\n        // Set the result to the difference between the lengths\n        $result = $safeLen - $userLen;\n\n        // Note that we ALWAYS iterate over the user-supplied length\n        // This is to prevent leaking length information\n        for ($i = 0; $i < $userLen; $i++) {\n            // Using % here is a trick to prevent notices\n            // It&#x27;s safe, since if the lengths are different\n            // $result is already non-0\n            $result |= (ord($safe[$i % $safeLen]) ^ ord($user[$i]));\n        }\n\n        // They are only identical strings if $result is exactly 0...\n        return $result === 0;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThere are a few problems here though that are non-trivial as are explained in the post: <a href=""http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/49849/timing-safe-string-comparison-avoiding-length-leak"" rel=""nofollow"">http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/49849/timing-saf...</a><p>Basically, while it <i>may</i> keep the length %64 safe (since cache lines are 64 bites wide), it doesn&#x27;t keep the length safe in general. Some length information will be leaked on larger strings. And considering it&#x27;s impossible to protect the length in the general case, making a function which says it protects length is a lie. Therefore I don&#x27;t even try and hence save the complexity.<p>But let me ask this: what cases would you have where are you trying to protect the length? Anything with variable length input (like a password) should likely be one-way hashed anyway. So you&#x27;d be comparing fixed-length hashes. So where&#x27;s the possible leak?",1417277121

Make the effort to go to local meetups, etc. One problem you have is that you don&#x27;t have other developers around. Knowing how to market yourself comes with awareness and experience you get by having relationships with other developers. Get out to a local meetup or something.<p>Without knowing more, in general:\n1. If you&#x27;re able to reduce your salary requirements then look for something that offers you a chance to build skills (sacrifice compensation for now).  \n2. You may need to relocate for greener fields.<p>As for tech choices, I think it&#x27;s more about being with a team (or project) that is actively practicing high-quality code craftsmanship.

Usually developers who complain about bloat aren&#x27;t thinking of web development in that context.<p>The number of challenges a framework should help a developer manage for a long-lived client-side JavaScript application is not trivial. It is absolutely true that Ember is heavier than other frameworks, but it has a specific style of development in mind. If someone chooses to build their app with an alternative, they often end up with a similar amount of code in other dependencies and application code.<p>And though we aren&#x27;t there yet, we&#x27;re working on ideas for modular loading of application code (via the pods patterns) and of Ember itself via tree shaking. This latter strategy leverages the fact that Ember&#x27;s code and much app code is written in ES6, and thus we can identify and drop un-referenced code.",1417276952

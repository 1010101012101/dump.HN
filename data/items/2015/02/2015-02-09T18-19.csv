Here&#x27;s what they were after, people who would work for very low pay but who made commission on cell phones. 95% cell phones in the orientation meeting, It was all cell phones for them and as I observed for many years after. Because it was all about commission and if you didn&#x27;t sell mobile phones, you were not gonna make any money. Now keep in mind I went to the radio shack because I was interested in gadgets and building stuff.  And when somebody needs a simple cable replacement and they see that it&#x27;s 17.99 for an rca cable that is 2.99 on Amazon, the customer feels burned by the same store that supposedly America &quot;trusted&quot; for 70 years. Radio Shack could have merged with Monoprice 4 years ago and kicked butt on that instead of competing with Best Buy, Toys R Us, guitar center, batteries plus and Amazon all at the same time.<p>Now let&#x27;s compare to say a home store. There are a lot of home stores, big and small. Some do better than others, many try really hard to compete with Lowes and HD by stocking really smartly. And they can keep people in through relationships. Hiring old experts who can tell you how something is done, and younger apprentice hands who can absorb a lot of info as well as lift 100 lbs into your car like nothing. (again service mindset).  Also big box home stores do rentals and they also have classes. Camera shops also offer classes.<p>Radio Shack certainly sold *some cool stuff over the years but they never could be a place I could trust or rely upon to carry anything specific. I never felt like I got a good price on anything let alone a deal. The only time I ever felt I paid regular price was when they happened to have a little cable connector, it had no price and the manager was like eh just give me 1.99. He made up the price according to what he thought it was worth, the same price I thought it was probably worth. But you can bet had it had an active sku, it would have been 7.99.<p>Radio Shack had so many opportunities to be a provider of cool things. They could have even become a refurbish tech dealer selling lots of refurb game systems and controllers and probably done well.

Once autovacuum is marking dead tuple space as reusable (dead tuple space that was largely created by earlier iterations of the loop issuing your query), subsequent iterations can use that space for their new tuples, and the table should reach steady-state size, or at the very least, grow much more slowly. This is even more likely when you make autovacuum more aggressive on the table in question while you&#x27;re doing this.<p>Additionally, however, if you&#x27;re bulk rewriting the table in one query, autovacuum has no (or very limited) opportunity to mark dead tuples as truly dead — especially if there&#x27;s any lock contention going on, so other, older xids are waiting for your bulk update to complete — so in the worst case your table is half dead tuples, and twice the size it needs to be.",1423507739

Just out of curiosity, is it stated anywhere that Swift is memory-safe in parallel mode?<p>I admit to not being intimately familiar with Swift, but I assume it is (or is aiming to be), because Objective-C objects are all atomically reference counted, and the language makes an effort to section off the unsafe parts (via names like &quot;UnsafeMutablePointer&quot;).<p>> (I assume that whatever implementation exists is similar for Rc&#x27;ed objects in Rust, assuming Swift is indeed parallel-memory-safe.)<p>Rc is not thread safe, but the language and libraries prevent Rc&#x27;d objects from ever moving between threads, so the lack of thread safety of Rc doesn&#x27;t make the language less thread-safe. There is a separate type, Arc, that is thread-safe and can be sent between threads. (Arc also prevents mutation of the protected data without a mutex or atomic operations.) Swift&#x27;s approach, by contrast (as far as I know) is to atomically reference count all objects. (This approach is inherited from Objective-C, and more broadly Core Foundation.

I don&#x27;t remember Hitler giving any orders to start a persecution of Jews, but I do remember mainstream holocaust historian Raul Hilberg saying under oath in a 1985 Toronto trial that there are no documents to source that claim, and that the Nazis conducted what they did through a &quot;meeting of minds, a consensus mind-reading by a far-flung bureaucracy&quot;. Without documentation, this is conspiracy theory at best.<p>No doubt the Nazis killed millions of Jews. But they did not conspire to do so. Let&#x27;s make sure we teach people real history, not conspiracy theories with hidden pro-Israel agendas. The Nazis committed innocenticide at a large scale, but after 1970s WWII became all about the chosen people, and I thought we were all Africans.<p>I&#x27;ll preempt your calling me &quot;anti-Semite&quot; by saying I have nothing against any ethnicity (but I do have something against religions that say their people are better than other people, like the Nazi religion or the Judaism religion, in fact I&#x27;m against all religions) and I do not believe for a second that religious Jews conspire in any way, like Raul Hilberg believes the religious Nazis conspired through mind reading. That, my friends, is preposterous.<p>Edit: If you read Raul Hilberg&#x27;s book The Destruction of European Jews you&#x27;d learn that in 1933 the final solution was deportation. Only after 1941 is it ever seriously claimed by mainstream historians that the final solution became killing. So Judea declared war on Germany over their plans to deport Jews. This should put things in perspective and this is mainstream history no matter how uncomfortable for you it is to accept.<p>PS: if you do come up with a source, please also address why Raul Hilberg did not consider that a source when he testified under oath in 1985.<p>PPS: downvoters, could you please point out where I&#x27;m wrong or why am I deserving of downvoting?",1423507253

At worst it suggests that children with autism growing up is problematic - and this is an idea that has long currency as the predominate attitude among western cultures.<p>Nobody is writing articles the &quot;When Children with Dyslexia Grow Up&quot; or &quot;When Gifted Children Grow Up&quot; because we implicitly accept that people with these identifying traits are adults when they have grown up.

There&#x27;s more about how hard it was to go into work than about his antagonist’s suffering childhood sexual abuse - and in narrative form the autistic adult is the author&#x27;s antagonist no two ways about it.

Like you I had grown up a tinkerer and would visit their stores at least twice a month. This had continued throughout my teen years in the 80s. When I was hired, in &#x27;91 there was a feeling of a change in company ethics happening. There were the older, more experienced, long time employees as well as a batch of newer, younger, less knowledgeable kids. While I can&#x27;t prove it, there was a sense that the company was trying to shed their image and take on a new, younger appeal. Home computers were the big tech item of the time. In the rural area where I grew up there were not as many young people like myself who were interested in computers or tech in general. I know, it was hard to find people my age with similar interests. I imagine RadioShack had to start hiring &#x27;smiling faces&#x27; instead of knowledgeable people in many places during that period.<p>The management was worked hard, we were worked hard. It was thankless work with many expectations any reasonably smart person would scoff at. Spontaneous 8-hour inventories announced the day of, maybe 4 hours in advance are merely the tip of the iceberg. What I saw there were young employees who desperately needed a job, any job that didn&#x27;t require flipping burgers or working at refineries doing manual labor. They didn&#x27;t know anything about the products we were selling. I became the go to guy in our store for all knowledge. I eventually couldn&#x27;t take the abuse and left for greener pastures. The people who stayed were grunt labor, not the kind of people you want selling tech outside of a mobile-phone store; just smiling faces.<p>As the years went on I visited the store less and less as they just didn&#x27;t have the stuff I needed, or when I did buy something there it would be of terrible quality and I would regret the purchase. I believe that had a lot to do with their slow decline, a need to modernize in the 90&#x27;s coupled with a lack of knowledgeable people.

9022703,comment,9018319,9018671,0,0,cweagans,,,"Yes, it was already in place when I was hired. I&#x27;m a Drupal developer, and pretty much every site that I work on uses 10s or 100s of contributed modules from Drupal.org. When a bug is reported to us, the first thing we do is narrow down what module is causing it and then go look through the issue queue for that module to see if it&#x27;s already been reported. If so, then we can just apply the patch from that issue. If not, then we fix it and upload the patch to Drupal.org. We&#x27;re already doing 99% of the work involved in open source contribution. Why not do the remaining 1% and get the benefits from it?<p>There&#x27;s a clear benefit to doing this. If we have a module that we have to apply 100 patches to in a specific order every time we upgrade the module, that&#x27;s a lot of maintenance burden. If we submit those patches upstream and let the module maintainer roll them into the module, then maybe we only have 4-5 patches to apply. That makes upgrades significantly easier. In fact, our developers are the maintainers of some of the modules that we use, so they have incentive to be responsive maintainers. When a patch is posted, it&#x27;s in their best interest to commit it ASAP so that we don&#x27;t have to include that patch in our patch list.<p>Getting to that point is step 1, and it&#x27;s relatively easy if you work in an environment where you depend on a lot of external open source software.<p>The next step is slowly pushing a cultural shift in your company to develop things in a generic way that would be useful to people outside of your organization. Unfortunately, there&#x27;s no clear cut way to do this, as it depends on too many factors. Again, though, the justification really comes down to maintenance burden. If it&#x27;s open source and people use it, then it&#x27;s likely that other people will help you maintain it (fixing bugs, adding features, etc). The more you involve the community, the more likely it is that you will be able to share the maintenance burden. An example of this is that a few of our developers co-maintain this module: <a href=""https://www.drupal.org/project/media_theplatform_mpx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.drupal.org/project/media_theplatform_mpx</a><p>We needed to integrate with a video service, and since it&#x27;s a third party commercial service, it&#x27;s likely that somebody else needs to integrate with it as well, so we did all of the generic integration in the module I linked to before, and then the very few things specific to my team&#x27;s product go into a module that we don&#x27;t open source.<p>One thing that I&#x27;ve noticed is that it really comes down to your supervisor being open to looking at things a little differently, but I think the long term benefits are clear and definitely worthwhile.",1423506186

Another factor is that there are just a few bulge bracket investment banks to facilitate large IPOs. Their loyalties are more with the repeat players that buy IPOs than the smaller players that sell them.<p>Note that the founders who sell into an IPO tend to hold onto a lot more stock than they sell, so they&#x27;re not solely concerned with getting the best price at the IPO.

The aspect I appreciate most (and as far as I am aware somewhat separates the Swiss system from others) is the permeability between the trade and academic spheres.<p>The vocational schooling (as discussed in the article) consists of two parts; technical skills and general education. The latter part is divided into two groups: apprentices are required to either complete the mandatory program or invest some extra effort and earn a high school equivalency diploma (Berufsmaturität) at the same time. Students who fail theirs drop to the standard program and continue their apprenticeship.<p>Upon completion, those who chose to get a Berufsmatur hold the necessary certifications to get into any University of Applied Sciences in their field and pursue a Bachelor&#x27;s or Master&#x27;s degree. Access to general Universities is limited to those holding a &quot;proper&quot; Matura, but there even is a one-year program for people with a Berufsmatur to attain a full Matura. Universities again are (to some degree) required to offer part-time programs, so studying and working at the same time is possible.<p>Finally, students who finished an UAS BSc/MSc are generally admitted to standard Universities. Some terms (between half a semester and a full year of extra classes required) may apply, but there actually is a reasonable path from dropping out of &quot;proper&quot; high school to getting an MSc or possibly even a ScD/PhD.<p>Just like Tobi I consider myself a kinesthetic learner. School never really piqued my interest, so my performance was lackluster. I went for an apprenticeship instead, combined it with a Berufsmatur, later on with a BSc in Computer Science and as I am now finishing my MLaw in Cybercrime/Information Security, I am barely a year or two older than most of my peers but hold (including the apprenticeship) around a decade of professional experience.

If the Fed wasn&#x27;t run by people but only machines I&#x27;d still hate it, like I hate High Frequency Trading.

It was the go to place for things like floppy disks, batteries, cables, stereos, etc.  Sure, it wasn&#x27;t pro-quality but it was good enough. Then pretty much all those items because obsolete or commoditized.  Big box stores had all these things, and more, and usually cheaper with better brands than RS&#x27;s in house and underwhelming &#x27;Realistic&#x27; brand.  Walgreens started stocking disks, CD&#x27;s, cables, etc, which became easy as everyone pretty much standardize on the iPod and iPhone ten years ago. Hard to find stuff was easily gotten on the web and Amazon&#x27;s big push to take on 3rd party sellers into their system meant you could find pretty much anything right there.<p>I see all this hand-wringing about how RS had a golden age where it was staffed with nothing but EE&#x27;s and had everything you can imagine, but that seems an overly pleasant interpretation of their product and services. Even during the &quot;golden age&quot; there was never anyone who knew anything about the components I was buying and I was happy to be left alone. The stock there was largely unimpressive as well. I&#x27;m afraid nostalgia has taken over here for some people.  Not to mention, the margins on components was pretty much non-existent. The idea that it could have trivially turned itself into a &quot;Maker Supply&quot; depot is questionable as well.  The prices it would need to get by would chase off makers who knew they could get it for 1/10th the price on Amazon and with things like Prime shipping, it became a no brainer.<p>Brick and mortar retail is a cruel mistress. You have limited space and each shelf needs to bring in x amount of revenue if you want to stay open. How much space do you need to provide a decent experience to makers? How much would each one of those shelves bring in net everyday? Ten bucks maybe? Turning RS into a Akihabara-like component dumping ground just is financially unfeasible. Heck, the fabled Akihabara doesn&#x27;t even exist anymore, its all video arcades and game and model shops as I learned during my trip there last year.<p>RS is probably a cautionary tale of over-specialization without the &quot;boutique&quot; level of added value, but even that is questionable.  I have no idea what could have saved it and am highly skeptical that anything would have worked. It just doesn&#x27;t seem like a business that makes sense in the modern world.

He&#x27;s had a social worker with him every day, in class, attending to him every day of his public schooling.  (This is one reason why private schools do so well and cost less.  Imagine spending $60K+ on one student per year.)<p>His social skills are still not great, with an inability to focus on someone when they are talking, as well as biting and hitting others.<p>He&#x27;s incredibly smart though, with an ability to replay any piece of music that he just heard, and replay it on the piano.  He&#x27;s never taken a piano class or was taught piano in his life.<p>Can his trajectory still change at the age of 11?  It seems like the school is doing quite a bit, but he doesn&#x27;t seem to progress and still stuck in the same behaviors as he was in the second grade (first time he was in the same classroom as my daughter).",1423504811

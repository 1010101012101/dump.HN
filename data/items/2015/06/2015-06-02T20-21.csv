I jumped from research to the startup world, so maybe I have a high bar, but most startups are doing pretty boring, predictable variations on bog-standard systems work.

It&#x27;s possible for everyone to get perfect, or for no one.<p>>I don&#x27;t quite understand what the discussion in the link is trying to say but I take it to mean that they normalize between different versions of the test in the same year in a way that doesn&#x27;t depend on the ability of the cohort that took a specific version. That is still consistent with the fact that they do normalize across the entire test taking population.<p>That&#x27;s not what&#x27;s happening.<p>There are different versions of the test. ETS (the org running it) wants a score to mean the same thing no matter which version or year you took it in (well, besides for when they make major changes, like 1995.)<p>So every test includes one section that doesn&#x27;t count. You don&#x27;t know which one it is. Let&#x27;s say everyone who took Math non-counter-A gets an average of 540. The same people get an average of 520 on Math counts-B. So we know that 520 on B is just as good as 540 in whatever year A was given. So we scale, and anyone who got a 520 on on B is given 540 instead. This is extended for other scores, using math.<p>(Actually, this is probably done before converting away from raw scores.)<p>If everyone does poorly, that will make the average go down for the actual test, and also make the average go down for the non-counting section. Those factor out completely, meaning others&#x27; performances have zero effect on your score.<p>Hope that helps.",1433278537

9648912,comment,9645703,9647553,0,0,baby,,,"> We go on to consider Diffie-Hellman with 768- and 1024-bit
groups. A small number of fixed or standardized groups are
in use by millions of TLS, SSH, and VPN servers. Perform-
ing precomputations on a few of these groups would allow a
passive eavesdropper to decrypt a large fraction of Internet
traffic. In the 1024-bit case, we estimate that such com-
putations are plausible given nation-state resources, and a
close reading of published NSA leaks shows that the agency’s
attacks on VPNs are consistent with having achieved such
a break. We conclude that moving to stronger key exchange
methods should be a priority for the Internet community.<p>From: <a href=""https://weakdh.org/imperfect-forward-secrecy.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://weakdh.org/imperfect-forward-secrecy.pdf</a>",1433278525

9648859,comment,9647537,9647537,0,0,haberman,,,"Skimming the paper, I found it hard to get a handle on exactly what kind of abstraction and guarantees this system implements (I am a co-author on one of the cited papers, so I&#x27;m reasonably familiar with this space).  Maybe it is easier to understand for people who are already familiar with Storm.<p>Most notably, I couldn&#x27;t determine whether the system is stateful, or what kind of guarantees (if any) are provided regarding stateful processing.<p>For example, the paper says Heron is used to compute real-time active user counts.  That implies that the system needs some way to keep track of and &quot;remember&quot; how many unique users it has seen in the last N hours or whatever.  How does Heron model this state and how does it guarantee (if it does) that a crashing node will not lose its accumulated state?<p>In my experience this is the hardest part, by far, of stream processing, so when I see any work in this area it&#x27;s the first thing I am curious to learn about.  A system that guarantees strong consistency (ie. accurate counts) even in the presence of node crashes is way, way harder to get right (and a lot more expensive, resource-wise) than one that assumes it&#x27;s ok to lose a little bit of data.<p>It looks like Heron implements only at-most-once and at-least-once semantics, so maybe that is my answer there.  You need exactly-once semantics to get robust and reliable answers, and you need to guarantee that state changes are atomic with the exactly-once semantics.<p>Of course some systems are ok with their output degrading a little when nodes crash.  It&#x27;s not the end of the world if the active user count is a little off.  But beware of tolerating this too much -- the bad thing about allowing data loss is that it tends to come in storms (no pun intended).  Once something is going wrong, the answers can be way off.  The error is not bounded in most cases I&#x27;ve encountered.",1433278167

That would be hugely expensive, as the first reply to your comment mentioned, and it would also be less likely to find strong students for colleges. There is a lot of research on this. The current mixed admission system that includes standardized tests actually works better for colleges, at less expense, than a system of in-person interviews for all applicants.<p>AFTER EDIT: Important background information for this thread is that hundreds of colleges in the United States already have explicit policies of open admission, meaning that they admit all applicants, and the majority of colleges in the United States admit the majority of their applicants. Only a few hundred colleges (out of about three thousand in total) are selective by any meaningful definition of &quot;selective.&quot;",1433277233

And that&#x27;s just one current annoyance, as we can always talk about ODF, OpenGL and others.<p>The second reason for why I hated Microsoft is for their funding of SCO&#x27;s lawsuit for the ownership of Unix. That was a long time ago, they must have changed right? Except that currently they are behaving like a patent troll, extracting profit out of Android through what can be described as racketeering, more profit than they do from Windows Phone.<p>The third reason for why I now hate Microsoft is for how they are (again) pushing for Trusted Computing. It&#x27;s basically what happens when the OS provider becomes the gatekeeper of what you can install and do with your own computer. I never took this as a threat to personal computing, except that now Apple has made it acceptable. Things like insisting on logging in with Microsoft accounts, or only being able to install &quot;modern apps&quot; through their store (while taking a revenue cut of course) would have been unthinkable only 10 years ago.

If your boss pays for such a service, it probably points to a wider issue with them, or you. Either your boss is happy with you and your performance, or they aren&#x27;t. If the former, what incentive do they have to catch you red-handed lying about sick days? Do they even care, ultimately, if you&#x27;re getting the job done? If not, why would they pay for and/or use such a service? However, if in their opinion you&#x27;re not getting the job done, and they&#x27;re actively looking for evidence presumably to support firing you, and you&#x27;re actually guilty of lying about sick days - well... that sounds like an extremely unhealthy situation that would probably come to a bad end anyway, with or without them using such a service.<p>2. (Disclaimer, this may be wildly wrong or pure fantasy, IANAEconomist) How do they feed this data into their risk models exactly? This won&#x27;t increase everyones&#x27; premiums - rather it would result in some premiums going up, others down. If, due to poor models, it results in some premiums going up unfairly, then presumably some other insurance company will figure this out so those actually-not-that-risky clients will switch to them for lower premiums. There will be disruption, and temporarily some people will be treated unfairly, but the market will adjust and actually may become fairer all round eventually. Transparency in this case should actually be a good thing, right? Or are we saying that people who are actually riskier should be subsidised by the less risky?<p>3. The type of person to use such a service would not just do so because it&#x27;s easy. This is a fundamental matter of morals. The type of person to use this service would be incredibly likely to do bad things <i>anyway</i>, regardless of the tools available to them to do bad - technology will not take otherwise moral people and suddenly make them immoral just because it&#x27;s easier now than it was yesterday.

It could be a (highly-unlikely) coincidence, but the end-user satisfaction with both the latter products is far greater than for Windows Vista.<p>Obviously a correlation does not imply causation, but it's certainly food for thought (even if slightly rehashed/redundant).",1211287941

194870,comment,48294,48294,0,0,warrens,,,"Good stuff.<p>The actual statistic (Business Links, UK) is 90% of startup businesses go bust within the first 6 months. If you can hang on longer than this, the statistics improve. This mainly has to do with cash flow, startup costs etc. which many starups don't adequately plan for. If the business model enables you to survive ""indefinitely"" and and you have minimum operating and living costs, this works fine.  However, the other problem is stagnation - if you're not growing and no new ideas or changes are going into the business, you're going nowhere, no matter how long you hold on. Sincwe markets change quite rapidly, chances are that an idea that was great 3-4 years ago, will be stale and done by somebody else if it's not acted on quickly enough.",1211285495

This may be what you think you want, but it's not what you really want.<p>Why do you want to join an ambitious startup rather than creating your own?<p>Why does the startup you join need to be ambitious?<p>Why does it need to be a startup?<p>For that matter, why do you want to join as a programmer rather than, say, a graphic designer?<p>If the answer to the above questions is ""because this is a route to making lots of money"", then what you <i>want</i> is to make lots of money -- and you happen to have identified ""joining an ambitious startup as a programmer"" as a way to pursue that goal.  Similarly, your goal might be ""to change the lives of millions of users"", ""to become a world-famous hacker"", or ""to work with a bunch of really cool people"".<p>But whatever you want... well, it's almost certainly not ""joining an ambitious startup as a programmer"".<p>--------<p>Now that I've finished ranting about desires vs. routes towards satisfying those desires: The above is actually relevant to your question.  The skills looked for vary dramatically from startup to startup -- a startup which is likely to make you a millionaire isn't necessarily going to be looking for the same skills as a startup which is full of really cool people.  Once you've identified what you find attractive about startups, <i>then</i> you can start thinking about which startups currently exhibit those traits, and what skills they look for.",1212209806
205090,comment,204848,204916,0,0,Tichy,,,"""Why is it a law that children must attend school if not to underscore the value of spreading knowledge that we've acquired.""<p>That sounds rather naive. Societies make it a law for children to go to school so that they become good citizens of said societies. It is a self-perpetuation thing. Imagine christians would raise their children to be muslims, christianity would not survive long.<p>Just saying that from the existence of such a law you can not derive that it is a good thing.",1212209741

I'd rather have disadvantaged teenagers drawing little icons for $5 a hour than working as hookers to get $10 a night--even if it means that designers in the US won't be able to afford to live in downtown S.F., drinking $6 cups of coffee, and buying $5K of gadgets every year.",1212209497

A lot of businesses are posting ads (non-internet) that say ""Go to Yahoo.com and search for <company name>"" instead of saying ""Go to <company name>.com/<project name>"".<p>This trend should increase with the proliferation of mobile web browsing; typing a domain name is a pain, and I hope to make browser plugins for each mobile browser that capitalizes on this new development.",1212209037

Programming seems good, but I've read two independent sources that say it's lonely.  Does it have to be this way, or is it a question of what kind of person you are?

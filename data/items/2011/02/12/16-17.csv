The agency model under which the vast majority of Amazon's ebook sales are done has a requirement from the publisher's that they get 70% of the sale price, regardless of what said sale price is. If Amazon jacks up the price for iOS sales, then they get 70% of that, and Apple gets the other 30%. Not going to happen. Personally, I'd bet on Apple announcing sometime in the near future a drastically reduced cut for in-app content purchases, more like a payment processor's cut, I.E. 5% or less.",1297529941

I think it is hard to find a better way to differentiate the barbershops from the startups short of having smart folks in the government who subjectively examine each application - and we all know how likely that is. Also, if we go that route, the startup visa will take years just like the current green card application which IIRC requires an in person interview.<p>Vivek does have a point as well though. Currently, employers who sponsor ""green cards"" have the power to get the sponsored employees and their families kicked out of the country simply by firing them. I don't think you'd want to replicate this with the startup visa. Using investors as an 'entrance requirement' may be o.k., but once someone qualifies for a startup visa, the path to a permanent residency should either be really short (months, not years) or independent of whether the investor continues to 'support' the entrepreneur.<p>I am in favor of strong filtering up front, but anyone who qualifies should then be treated just like an American citizen or permanent resident.",1297529772

Then again, some of you will argue that support can be used as a sales process; I don't care how big/small of a company you run, customer service is probably the single most important factor (from a consumers standpoint) next to the product.<p>I've tried Zendesk and while they're great in parts like ticketing and assigning tasks to individual support members, I think they fail at recognizing at the bases of customer support. THERE IS NOTHING MORE THAT I HATE when I have to register twice. I already have an account at xyz.com, why do I have to create one to fill out a support request?

I think one of the problems that many forums run into is that the folks qualified to write the software and deal with the technical support are frequently not the best people for dealing with people.  Then they try to come up with technical solutions to people problems and it really doesn't work.  The other issue is that most people I have met who are both people-person's and highly socially insightful tend to be master manipulators.  This will get you some initial success but in the long run it is a poison pill.<p>I don't meet too many people who are both highly socially observant <i>and</i> have no goal of manipulating and maneuvering people.  Fostering community requires you to be socially aware and also good at respecting people's boundaries.  Those two things seem to not coincide too often.  So I am not sure how well I could teach people to do what I do (though I know I could put some info together to help others with this and have done so on occasion for previous forums I belonged to).  I sometimes fantasize about having people pay me to join their forum for a few months (edit: or review what they are doing and give them feedback on improving it).  My experience has been that once critical mass is achieved, the culture becomes self-perpetuating.  I can breathe life into it but it does not die just because I leave.  On one email list, I returned after a two year absence and cultural things I had started were still there. (Technically, that's the only place I ever got any significant recognition for what I do.  I was a moderator and people very much noticed how the place went from a cold atmosphere with anemic traffic to warm and lively in just a week once I began moderating.)<p>Someone told me today I have ""no business sense"".  That's probably true.

This is significant because my prior programming experience was limited to some PHP, along with HTML and CSS. I hadn't worked with Objective-C before and I am a self-taught programmer--I knew I was in for some work.<p>So I signed up for O'Reilly's Safari bookshelf and added some books to it (several from Apress) and started reading.<p>Next thing I knew, I was building some basic-level apps. This gave me the confidence to build more complex apps, so I tried my hand at some more challenging tutorials. I was so engrossed in coding that I would routinely look up to find that it was 1 or 2am. In the morning I would wake up, make sure my laptop was charged and get cracking.<p>This went on for 2 weeks (mostly over the holidays) and then I realized that I had other matters that needed my attention. After missing an important phone call because I was so distracted with coding, I wondered if I should set up an Automator task to remind me of appointments (I eventually caught up with the person and everything worked out great).<p>These days, I am reading up on OOP and writing up use cases. And I'm still coding. All this in addition to the work I normally do.<p>I gave coding an inch and that sucker took a mile.<p>I guess the point of this is to say (and of course you all know this already) that coding is awesome. On some level, I knew this from my previous programming efforts, but OOP has opened my eyes to a whole new world of coding. Now that I've gotten started, I can't stop.<p>I wish more people understood the joy of coding.<p>JFC<p>P.S.

Yes, you may kick off an interesting discussion, but beware of statistics collected in this way. For example, you have no control over how long the question stays up on this page. Chances are you will not get any people who only read HN on weekdays (maybe because they spend their time building awesome web apps all weekend and don't want to be distracted). This introduces bias. You also have no control over randomizing the possible answers, so there may be another kind of bias. Basically, you have no guarantees that the people that upvoted individual answers here (a) actually build web apps, (b) are being honest (c) are in any way representative of the industry or any part of the industry, or even of HN.

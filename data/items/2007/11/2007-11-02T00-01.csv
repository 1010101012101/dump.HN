75280,comment,75158,75276,0,0,jpuskarich,,,"Right now, you'll find that our results for relatively specific searches (e.g. LG 42"" Plasma - <a href=""http://www.bountii.com/search.php?item=lg+42%22+plasma&sort=price_asc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bountii.com/search.php?item=lg+42%22+plasma&s...</a>) are really good.<p>However, like you mentioned, a broader search- ""Playstation 3"", yields more than consoles.  We're working hard to improve the quality of our results for broad searches like this.  For now, we decided to make the price filter very accessible to people. When you get back more than consoles for your ""Playstation 3"" search, we hope you'll narrow your results to those ""> $200"" to skip over the games and accessories.",1193963649

Or can it do other things as well? Can I extract social graphs out of  OpenSocial - i.e. if I have two people emails addresses, can I tell if they're connected somewhere withing the OpenSocial network?",1193962556

Nonetheless, I've been playing around with it, and I'm very much impressed with the speed and ease of use of the service.  Well done.<p>One suggestion though that may or may not be helpful at this point.  Perhaps when a user searches, you can have a ""short list"" that lists the most popular products in that search, so that the search can be narrowed to a single product.<p>For instance, when I type ""bluetooth headset,"" a short list of headset models could come up on top of the results.  When I click on one, it limits it to, say, H700.<p>Also, I searched for ""Playstation 3.""  I was looking for the console, but got one console result and a bunch of games.  Perhaps categories like ""Playstation 3 Console,"" ""Playstation 3 Games,"" ""Playstation 3 Accessories,"" etc.<p>The former would be much easier to do than the latter I'd imagine, but both types would be helpful.",1193961977

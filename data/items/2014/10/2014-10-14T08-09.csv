It is important to know that key escrow does not itself mean that the keys are escrowed to law enforcement, but in many cases it is obvious or it is spelled out explicitly: &quot;In order to receive the information, law enforcement may submit a request to each of the entities identifying the communication session and their basis for authorization.&quot; [2] It is also important to know that law enforcement escrow systems may also apply under different categories, so this list has both type 1 and type 2 error.<p>The number of companies on the list is huge and include essentially all of the &#x27;blockbuster&#x27; names in the tech industry, from IBM to Amazon to Fujitsu to Seagate to Apple to Symantec to F-Secure, etc. (I have a longer list here, although it has not been combed for law enforcement escrow and it is also not representative of the names on the patent search list [3]). Care must be taken to discern which patents would have applicability to serve orders such as those by National Security Letters or to comply with the decryption requirements of CALEA.<p>There&#x27;s some scary stuff in there, like &quot;Automatic recovery of TPM keys&quot; (Lenovo) [4] and &quot;Cloud key escrow system&quot; (Microsoft) [5].<p>HP obtained a patent (in 2008) for PC backdoors [6].<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?tbm=pts&hl=en&q=uspclass%3A%22380%2F286%22"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?tbm=pts&hl=en&q=uspclass%3A%22...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.google.com/patents/EP2637350A2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/patents/EP2637350A2</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8452070"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8452070</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.google.com/patents/US8290164"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/patents/US8290164</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://www.google.com/patents/US20120321086"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/patents/US20120321086</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://www.google.com/patents/EP1059578A2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/patents/EP1059578A2</a>",1413274418

Chilling because it&#x27;s already a reality and imagine if we, the free West, lived under constant fear of drones flying over our heads, watching entire houses or car infront of you get blown up without warning, vowing vengeance and to join a resistance against the drone wielding country.",1413274356

Unfortunately I found that the sceptics were largely right about Swift:<p>The safety features did not make the code more safe, but caused new classes of bugs. Runtime performance fairly random. Generics caused ten times as many problems as they solved. Optionals simply added runtime crashes, no additional safety.<p>And this was surprising, given that I regularly program Java with its optionals, use finals everywhere, clearly annotate nullables and of course I use its generics. (Given how poor the generics is in Java, anything would be an improvement, right? Or so I thought)<p>Programming in Swift isn&#x27;t <i>anything</i> like programming in Java/C++. It adopts a much stricter typing model - then leaves you hanging without the tools to overcome the consequences of it. Same with generics, stricter constructor rules etc.",1413274304
8452403,comment,8448896,8451608,0,0,jude-,,,"> The thing is we&#x27;re already dealing with disjoint sets of programs and broken composability. Thats why so many shell one liners take the form...I mean we have to do the C->Bash->Awk->Bash->C precisely because nothing actually works together and thats with just text.<p>You seem to contradict yourself :)  Yes, you might have to munge some text to get the disparate programs to work together.  But, at the end of the day, you get the result you want, because munging the data is <i>possible</i>.  Contrast this to a world where munging the data is all but impossible, since each program speaks different objects.  Then you&#x27;ll have some real breakage on your hands, unless you can write O(N^2) inter-object mungers to replace the O(1) text-based mungers you were using before.<p>> If we did mandate some IPC and ran across a program that couldn&#x27;t speak it? Well as long as our smart program had a toString equivalent we wouldn&#x27;t be any worse off than we are now. But between programs that spoke it we&#x27;d be better off.<p>How would this be an improvement?  Most programs (i.e. the ones that don&#x27;t know your &quot;smart&quot; program&#x27;s IPC object format) would fall back to using the toString() method.  The comparatively small set of programs that can use your program&#x27;s IPC objects would be tightly coupled to each other, meaning a change to the IPC object structure or semantics will require modifications to most/all of the programs.  If anything, your proposal exacerbates the &quot;disjoint sets of programs&quot; problem, and has the effect of turning the legacy/compatibility option (toString()) into the ironically future-proof method for interacting with &quot;smart&quot; programs.",1413274273

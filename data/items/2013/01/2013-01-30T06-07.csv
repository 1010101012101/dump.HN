I don't think it's particularly coherent - from what I know it's one of the many parts of modern cultural theory, stemming from sociology, anthropology, and history, among others, which in modern times have become extremely theoretical and disconnected from reality, and tend to say very little with a lot of very complicated words.<p>2) Ultimately everything, including human behaviour, boils down to the principles of fundamental physics. Human behaviour is just the most complex expresion of these principles of which we are aware.<p>3) I mostly jumped on the hint of social constructionism because I absolutely hate it when people try to argue that beauty and aesthetic standards are purely constructed and hence artifical or arbitrary, which is patently not true.

Again I recommend Steven Pinker, his book The Blank Slate also touches on this I believe.<p>4) Mostly though I wanted to offer some logical reasons why people on online games might tend to wish to present themselves as, for men, muscular, strong, dominant figures, and for women, attractive, assertive, desirable figures.",1359528725

Many people have programming jobs that don't have CS degrees. You mention your age, and sure out in the Valley there are those types that have the mindset of Logan's Run and about age 28 is time when programmers need to be put out to pasture, but this is not true in most places, probably not totally true in the Valley either. If you want to do programming, or anything, learn skills and go for it. You don't need to be so attractive that 90% of companies want to hire you; you just need to find that one person that will take a chance on you.<p>I recently met someone much older than you, take six months learning .NET and C# (this is not an advertisement for that platform just a real example), then found a job as a contractor at a government agency (or sub contractor) and started building experience, now he has no problems finding programming work. It's not glamorous mega high paying stuff but it's not bad and he's not even that driven. So, early 30's is not the end of the world.<p>How to stop regretting?

5138431,comment,5138048,5138048,1,0,MojoJolo,,,"I bet it's a misunderstanding of what Computer Science really is. In my opinion, many youngsters or people that's not in the tech world think Computer Science as just programming, or developing a website. I have an experience on this because my parents are forcing me to develop a website in which I don't like and they reacted with <i>""what is your education for?""</i><p>But what they don't realized is that Computer Science is more than developing a website or programming. CS deals with math, algorithms, and such words that they haven't heard before. Automata, discrete math, pumping lemma. Computer Science is much harder than they thought. With this, many students in my university shift to another course because they can't handle CS. Too many students are enrolling CS becase they think it is the trend. They think it is the right course to learn how to develop website, how to create something like Facebook, how to develop an app, how to develop something like Instagram, or even how to create a game (<a href=""http://blog.jpbalb.in/post/16048908922/game-programming-anyone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.jpbalb.in/post/16048908922/game-programming-anyo...</a>)!

If it's still not fast enough think about upgrading the hardware. Also, there's something called a profiler: use it.<p>It's really amazing what $200 of RAM will get you in terms of performance, ditto for $2000 worth of SSDs.<p>Then add caching, and yes, if you made your site 'fast' to begin with you now have two problems. If you made your site 'properly' then it shouldn't be a big deal to add it in.<p>Most of the reason Google is fast is that they have an ungodly amount of hardware. Google can put its hardware close to you, most startups cannot afford to put their hardware close to their users.<p>Fast is what makes you spend a week tracking down pointer manipulation problems, deadlocks, race conditions, etc, instead of lock free data structures, immutable values, closures and higher order functions. At least now we have CPUs with 16 cores so the pointer kids are finally realizing how moronic portable assembler really was for making anything other than operating systems.<p>I'll take code that's right over fast any day of the week.<p>PS.

They've also mastered metagaming and have pioneered some new, truly evil tactics.<p>For example, Sovereignty Wars in EVE (taking territory from others) is a long, gruelling process that can go on for months.  So the goons started launching their attacks at 3 or 4 AM on a monday, to force their adversaries to wake up and go into work with no sleep.  They'd do this daily, for a month.  In the end, rather than defeating their foe militarily, the opponent would get demoralized and give up, surrendering all of their territory rather than have EVE continue to affect their real lives.<p>Beyond that, though, they're simply an incredibly powerful faction.  There's a resource called technetium that's needed in order to build any of the massive ships, so it's vital for any sizeable corp to have.  The Goons grabbed a virtual monopoly on it, and formed OTEC which is a cartel whose goal is to fix the prices of technetium to make it so other groups could never match the goon's strength in massive ships, while growing ridiculously wealthy in the meantime.<p>Basically, the goons are just really shitty to play against.

Suppose you're right and he didn't kill himself. How do you think he benefits from you ""decoding"" the message like this? It seems more likely to me that if he did stage his suicide for some greater purpose you would be implicitly defeating that purpose by publicizing that it is fake. In this scenario what you're doing is undermining his plan for no particular reason.<p>In the far more likely possibility (heck, let's call it ""reality"" for short) he <i>did</i> kill himself, and all you're doing with this nonsense is twisting the knife, hurting his friends and family with your lunatic rantings because to you a big pile of digital crap cobbled together constitutes evidence, and the person whose physical body was found and buried or cremated or whatever, is a detail that somehow seems to you less real and easier to fake than all that digital nonsense.<p>In other words, this bullshit is detrimental <i>whether you are right or wrong</i>. But you are oh-so-wrong.<p>Point zero. A website footer. I would have led with something a little more potent. Settling estates takes longer than a couple weeks.<p>Point one is better explained by the null hypothesis.<p>Point four is better explained by the fact that suicidal people think and talk about suicide.<p>Point five is adequately explained as an homage. You can't dust the bits for fingerprints.<p>Point seven is completely speculation by you. You're missing the statistical point that while anonymous might have needed a lot of time to crack <i>a particular</i> government website, they can find a vulnerable one <i>today</i> on any particular day. Why didn't they hack the DOJ website or the Attorney General's site? Because this one was easier.<p>Point eight. Again, you can't dust bits for fingerprints. Your results aren't meaningful because the only two possible authors aren't Aaron Swartz and Paul Graham. If you pick two random people out of the whole country and a note written by a third person, run them through this program, it will come back saying the note was written by one of the two it knows about. Even if you had the entire internet as your corpus with every person's contribution perfectly tagged, it could still have been his writing stitched together by other people and come back identified as him. Especially since the ""control"" is Paul Graham, who has his own ""unique style.""<p>The points I didn't discuss are either trivial and lend no significant weight to your hypothesis or incoherent to me.<p>Quite apart from all that you still need to explain some things. Like, how someone could fake a death in this country at all. Having known plenty of people who've passed away, I can tell you the government is pretty interested in seeing the body and there is a pretty impressive paper trail involved. You can't really conjure up an empty casket. If the next step in your crazy adventure is finding a way to make the government complicit in a staged suicide, I will not feel much remorse for writing you off as some kind of internet schizophrenic. In fact, I probably draw the line much further than you'd find comfortable, right around the presumption that a 26-year-old could convince Mom and Dad and the rest of the family to cry it up for the camera while he chillaxes at home hacking ussc.gov. Call up your folks and ask them if they'd do that for you so you can avoid 6 months of jail, I'll wait. (They said ""no."")<p>Indeed, I'd like to know who else you think has faked their death. The other names that come to mind (Andy Kaufman, Jim Morrison) have been slowly accepted as having actually died as the years wore on and nobody found either of them in Tahiti sipping cocktails.<p>Here is what would constitute proof that he didn't kill himself: Aaron, alive, in the flesh.<p>Here is what should constitute proof that he killed himself: he is dead and his family identified the body.<p>Here is what does not constitute proof of anything: that his style of writing is more like that of whoever writes crap for Anonymous than Paul Graham, that he talked about killing himself before he did it, that his estate isn't settled, that he and his friends had in-jokes, that text comes in many colors and shapes including green on black, that he liked puzzles, that he planned his suicide before committing it, that anonymous found a government website relating to the justice program (seems like that would be a substantial portion of them), or that you managed to run software without first understanding what it did.<p>I hope you live near enough to Aaron's family to go tell them your theory, and I hope you'll give it a shot, because nobody would forgive me for punching you in the face, but they'd probably forgive his parents for it.",1359527132

I have been clear:  you can't program in English but there is some benefit to having languages which are easy for English-speakers to learn.<p>> Do you accept that programming has its basis in mathematics and logic?<p>This is one of the foundations of programming, particularly pronounced in technical fields.  As you get to solving higher level problems however, other things come into play.<p>For example, suppose we are building a robot to automate some physical process (let's say, making coffee).  We are going to have low-level programming  which takes care of ensuring that we can tell the robot what exactly we want to do.  If resources are tight we may do all of this low-level, but if we can spend more on resources we might want to have a higher-level (scripting, if you will) environment for brewing coffee.<p>On the higher level, our calculations are not going to be how many j of heat to add to the water.  They will be what temperature to bring the water to.  We may specify how finely the grounds are to be ground, etc.  These instructions will resemble a cookbook recipe more than they will resemble a mathematical diagram, and this is the difference between high-level and low-level languages.<p>>  If so, how is making computer languages resemble human languages a more direct way to improve comprehension than learning some math?<p>but the similarity is not just in vocabulary.  In English we might write ""three plus two equals five"" where ""plus"" is essentially a conjunction, three and two are subjects, equals is a verb, and five is the predicate/object.  This works because English has a subject-verb-object verb.  Similarly a equals b plus c tells us that we can find out the value of a by adding b and c.  In English there is a difference between a = b + c and b + c = a.  There may not be a logical difference but there is a semantic difference that does not exist in pure math.<p>So let's imagine math written in another language, Irish Gaelic, translated word-for-word into English and ignoring conjucated prepositions.  Irish Gaelic has a verb-subject-object word order, so we might write equals a adding and c.  Maybe a nice way to represent this symbolically would be (= a (+ b c)).  There wouldn't be a computer language like that, would there be?<p>The problem though that lisp encounters is that it is disorienting, and it is disorienting because the structure bears no resemblance to English.<p>If English-Likeness is a problem, surely that applies to word order and other syntactic similarities just as much as it applies to lexical similarities.",1359526707

Essentially, every ""tick"", player input would be received by the server and distributed back to players after validation for processing or display <i>on the next tick</i> (depending on whether processing is done server-side or client-side).  The lag is hidden by visual or auditory cues acknowledging the input (i.e., ""Yes, sir!"" or ""For the Horde!"").<p>This greatly reduces the bandwidth requirements because you have extra time to transmit the data to the user; you only send some of the unit data in each packet. Moreover, you can limit the data to units within X radius of the player/camera and simulate any ships outside of this radius, transmitting only major events like the destruction of a ship. (By simulate, I mean the game could just create random ships and explosions client-side to give the effect of a major battle without actually transmitting or receiving data about those ships; they would be eye-candy only.)",1359526040

That means that, even if the batteries themselves have no design problems per se, their failure modes under an overcharge condition are highly relevant.

They haven't gone into detail about exactly how everything works, but they have a ""network of banks"" where the money will be stored (which is how they get it FDIC insured), and they sit on top of that in some way.<p><a href=""http://banksimple.net/blog/2010/03/23/status-update/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://banksimple.net/blog/2010/03/23/status-update/</a><p>><i>When we first started thinking about starting a bank we looked into the de novo banking process. This is the process by which new banks are formed from scratch. This is both expensive and, more importantly, it takes too long to launch.

1355519,comment,1355072,1355196,0,0,stevenwei,,,"I disagree with this philosophy entirely and think it leads to a poor separation of concerns. There is plenty of template specific logic that has no business being in the view, and being forced to put it into your view because your template system is crippled ends up mixing concerns and causing more maintenance headaches than it needs to.<p>As a very simplistic (and somewhat contrived) example:<p><pre><code>  % for label in ('Home','Features','Pricing','Contact'):
    <li>{{ label }}</li>
  % endfor
</code></pre>
I'd much rather write that than repeat myself 5x, especially if what I'm doing is more complicated than a simple list tag.<p>In my mind, the view should be responsible for dealing with application logic and business logic. E.g. stuff like pulling things out of the database, dealing with GET/POST request data, validating forms, verifying user authentication and permissions, and whatever application specific logic is necessary.<p>The views should pass their data to the template, but not assume anything about how the template is being rendered, and not be doing things <i>for</i> the template. E.g. if you're doing something that renders a HTML snippet to pass into the template, you've done something wrong.<p>Once you start going down that road you make it much more difficult to render alternate versions of your templates (for mobile users for example).<p>Another case where the crippled templating system ends up pushing concerns into the wrong layer is rendering hierarchical data: e.g. a nested comments tree. Deciding how to render that data should be entirely within the scope of the template. But because of the lack of simple recursion support, the 'recommended practice' is to unravel the tree in your view code, and pass the unraveled version into the template. Or write your own template tag, but that is even more complicated.<p>It's also a bit silly that Django calls controllers 'views' and calls views 'templates', but perhaps it explains why they think it's okay to do view specific rendering at the controller level.",1274129839

(Within the topologies shown, that is, not just everyone sending to anybody as they feel like it. You could probably get by with full P2P without <i>too</i> much work, but having the central server simplifies things a lot and I don't think you lose much. I was never planning on 100 people ""in"" the same document.) Clients should probably chunk things up a bit during periods of rapid typing. (I was planning on going to raw sockets if I needed to; most higher level protocols would have indeed choked this from what I saw.)<p>Anyway, it's pretty theoretical now.

At its core, it's premised on the idea that threads are inherently easier than events, because they produce straight-line code and automatically handle tracking the state needed across a transaction. If that's true, then the article says threads are just as good as events once we solve all the problems that make threads dangerous or slow.<p>But it's not a given that threads are easy. In particular, as anyone who has spent time doing high-performance threaded code will tell you, there's the effort you have to put in to make sure your threaded code is <i>correct</i>, and then the 2x more time you have to put in to make sure that it's <i>efficient</i>; in particular, you have to do synchronization without effectively serializing all your threads. Which is a huge pain.<p>I think this is gradually becoming a moot point, as modern languages --- all of which have some kind of anonymous function and some approximation of closures --- allow us to write evented code that looks and feels like straight-line code. jQ callbacks in Javascript are the most vivid illustration of this idea (I suppose the node.js people are carrying that even further; I haven't played with it).",1274127070

After a few hours, that kick-back from each ""click"" adds up.<p>For some good pictures of good typing, look at old movies that feature professional secretarial pools.  Keep an eye on the ladies' posture, hand position, and light touch.<p>These days I also type with a light touch partly to extend the life of a somewhat expensive keyboard - one that let's me type without rotating my wrists (e.g., the typing position is similar to shaking hands rather than to picking up a pencil).",1274127022

The kernel can then immediately reclaim all resources needed by the process, without relying on that application being well written and responsive to a polite request to exit. Allowing the kernel to immediately reclaim application resources makes it a lot easier to avoid serious out of memory situations.<p>""If a user later returns to an application that's been killed, Android needs a way to re-launch it in the same state as it was last seen, to preserve the ""all applications are running all of the time"" experience. This is done by keeping track of the parts of the application the user is aware of (the Activities), and re-starting them with information about the last state they were seen in. This last state is generated each time the user leaves that part of the application, not when it is killed, so that the kernel can later freely kill it without depending on the application to respond correctly at that point.""<p>It sounds like Android has addressed the locked resource issue.  I'm not familiar with WinMo, but I suspect it tries to be cooperative and uncooperative (ornery or crashed) processes will cause the reclamation to fail.",1274127012

The newstand operator is responsible for what goes on inside his stand. If he's serving up junk, do we go blaming the rest of the world for the quality of his service?<p>Somehow we've taken Google out of the picture as an independent agent, It's as if whatever program they are running is somehow golden, and by outsiders changing the inputs that Google uses so that it doesn't work correctly that somehow the outsiders are at fault. But outisders don't set the inputs -- Google does. Outsiders don't write the ranking algorithm -- Google does. Outsiders don't make money from having ads alongside search results and tracking individual's search behavior -- Google does. Outsiders are free to do whatever they want -- that's the entire reason for picking one search provider over another, the fact that one engine can take the world as it is and do a better job of organizing it than another one can.<p>If we don't expect Google to be responsible for how they process data -- if we somehow place Google's poor results and put the blame on the world at large, then exactly what of value is Google providing here in our relationship?<p>Like I said, I'm a fan. I want them to do well. I'm happy to help if I can. But hell if I'm going to let Google off the hook for providing good search results simply because the nature of the internet has changed. Things change. That's what they're supposed to do.<p>This is like writing a web app that is open to SQL injection attacks and then getting pissed at everybody else when they crash your system. Except there's one big difference: with an SQL injection attack there is an outsider directly interacting with your system, perhaps malevolently. With Google, <i>outsiders don't even enter data in, Google goes and gets it</i>. We've got the shoe on the wrong foot, as my mother used to say.",1296255473

2153841,comment,2151715,2152480,0,0,sedachv,,,"Once you have dynamically scoped variables, you can implement dynamically scoped functions. There's a really great paper by Pascal Costanza showing how to to this, and why it's the mechanism behind aspect-oriented programming (no, it's not just monkey-patching!): <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/47747298/Dynamically-Scoped-Functions-as-the-Essence-of-AOP"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/47747298/Dynamically-Scoped-Functi...</a><p>You can generalize this to dynamically scoped object slots or whatever else you want, which Pascal does in the ContextL library: <a href=""http://common-lisp.net/project/closer/contextl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://common-lisp.net/project/closer/contextl.html</a><p>Actually, you don't even need built-in dynamic scoping, you can emulate it using unwind-protect (try-finally), which can itself be emulated: <a href=""http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/MetaCircular.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/MetaCircular.html</a><p>Once you have all that, you can implement Common Lisp's condition system. Here's Red Daly's implementation for JavaScript (Parenscript): <a href=""https://github.com/gonzojive/paren-psos/commit/6578ad223515dc2c1ddf49346f4baf7c3bee37c4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gonzojive/paren-psos/commit/6578ad223515d...</a><p>Of course, none of this is very useful without macros. For the condition system, you also have to be careful because any intermediate function that doesn't follow the protocol might swallow the exception.<p>The reason you want dynamic scoping is because it completely obviates the need for dependency injection or the service locator pattern. DI is IMO by far the stupidest fad in object-oriented programming, which is no small feat.<p>The Common Lisp condition system is great for doing things like writing network libraries. For example, an HTTP client library can throw any exception, like timeout, transfer error, encoding error, whatever, and offer a restart to let your retry the request (in just one place, independent of the exceptions). If you just want to retry but don't care why the thing failed, you do that. If you don't care about retrying, you just catch the error and report it, or whatever you want.<p>The other thing about the Common Lisp condition system is that it provides introspection on conditions and restarts. This means I can do things like offer correct condition support for programs running across thread (and, eventually, network) boundaries transparently in Eager Future2 (<a href=""http://common-lisp.net/project/eager-future/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://common-lisp.net/project/eager-future/</a>), in a portable way. By contrast, it's going to be impossible for C++ libraries using C++0x futures to be correct wrt exceptions without leaking their abstractions all over the calling code (if you don't wrap the exception, the information is not correct because who knows what thread/environment the future executed in, and if you do wrap it, you change the entire API).",1296255097

When I came to stronglifts I was, for all intents and purposes, starting all over again.  Based on my experience with it so far, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a beginner - and in fact, have.<p>It's important to note - at the risk of sounding like i'm appealing to authority - that the people who originally advocated this program have years of experience training themselves, and training other people.  At least one well known proponent has a relevant degree.  And no, these are not your usual PHd in bro-science ""trainers"" - they've trained elite competitors and olympic atheletes.  If they say this a good program for beginners, I'm inclined to take them at their word.<p>Having watched most of the beginners at the gym I'm at now, I can say for a fact that stronglifts would be a hell of a lot better than the average beginner's routine of sixty sets of curls, 20 sets of calf raises, 10 sets of reverse-incline-dumbell-flye-extension-no-set-hyper-mega-extensions, etc. etc....",1296253464

You type in a search term, it gives you results. There's nothing magic or special about it -- anybody with a smidgen of database training can make one (although nowhere near as Google's, granted)<p>Although some of these examples involve people ripping other people off, I get the feeling that somehow Google has become such a part of our lives that we feel as if somehow these folks trading links and trying to get attention are acting criminally. That anything that gets in the way of my getting instant information is a crime against humanity. That really bugs me.<p>It's not. Get over yourself. Sure, large parts of this may be well-funded, but there's nothing necessarily criminal going on. For instance lots of poor people in lots of third-world countries are making money dropping by my blog each day and telling me how awesome I am. It's not expected, but I'm happy they're making a few dollars. I can live with the inconvenience or try to fix it on my end. I don't need to blame them.<p>I don't like the state of Google search right now either, although I'm still a loyal customer. But what I see in the marketplace is humans reacting logically to their best interests. If you're going to monetize google search so that billions of dollars flows through it, there's going to be some ancillary effects that nobody predicted. Instead of blaming the people, understand that the people are just regular, intelligent folks doing the best they can. Hell, my wife is in a social group with a lady who made several thousand dollars adding advertiser text to her blogs -- until Google delisted her. She saw nothing wrong with it, and still is pretty pissed at Google. From her standpoint Google crapped all over her party.<p>And yes, Google has every right to delist sites and such. More power to them. I hope they continue to delist and evolve their search engine. I hope they get a handle on this. But I think we should all separate our well-wishes for Google's success from our opinions of our fellow man. I've heard linkspammers and spammers called ""subhuman"" and all sorts of nasty things. While there are criminals who are trying to rip you off, there's no evidence that there are more criminals on the web that anywhere else. Most of these people are trying to make a living. The fact they might inconvenience you on your way to get an answer to a technical question or find the latest mp3 you have to have is really not that high on their list of priorities -- nor should it be.<p>Google needs to do a better job. Period. There seems to be this ""conversation machine"" right now where people post articles showing how bad search is, then folks come out and rant, then Google makes an announcement. Repeat and rinse. It's as if we went down to the local newstand and asked the grocer for a magazine on trucks. He gives us a bunch of magazines on boats, so -- we blame the magazine publishers! It's simply not logical. A little perspective, please. Google is the provider here and those of us who like them should try to help out. But we shouldn't cross the line into thinking that anybody that annoys Google or searcher is somehow evil or criminal. That's crazy. Much better to understand people as rational actors than to demonize anybody who tricks some random American internet company.<p></rant>",1296253425

They go for ~$300 at a sporting goods store.<p>It's a lot of fun to shoot, the AK is cheap reliable, historical and can be used for fun, hunting (yes) and in survival situations.

I'm technical, he's non-technical. It seems like it's the same ol' story: We are doomed. He is trying to scale the business before we have customers or a product that has been proven in the market and won't listen to me on anything not technology related (and sometimes even tech-related things go without me). We are already an LLC (we were in the first week, actually) and have divvy'd up C-level titles.<p>He brought on one of his friends to be our ""CFO"" and do marketing-related activities. Marketing guy doesn't like the product and thinks we should pivot. So, the product is pivoted and I don't hear about said pivot until the decision has been made and the sales direction has changed (""We need the product to do X now"" where X is something entirely unrelated to the domain and requires a herculean effort). He also brought on a guy to do sales -- originally he was supposed to be doing sales but doesn't want to...so is paying someone else to do it which is suboptimal for many reasons.<p>To get some ""initial revenue in the door"" the company is getting signed up for consulting gigs. I'm not interested doing them and have concerns about the direction of the company (why do I keep saying company? We aren't a company). I voice the concerns but the proposal is sent anyway. Damn.<p>The guy is impossible to work with and I feel like a glorified (barely) code monkey working on something I'm not even interested in. He wants to be a ""vision guy"" but his vision is consistently flawed but refuses to take anyone's input. I feel like I should just go get a 9-5 at this point.<p>But, another project I started on whim a few weeks back is getting some traction! Unlike this company's product, I actually have users (non-paying, but at least a base of people to bounce my stuff off). So the future isn't entirely bleak, but it's going to be a rough conversation to have.<p>Edit: Boy, this post sounds pretty whiny. I did do some things -- a lot of things-- wrong. For instance, if we have a product that is not validated against a market there should be no reason for a pivot to be super painful. Likewise, I should have been better at asserting myself when decision time came. So, lessons for the next round, I suppose...",1296252343

The problem with Facebook lists is that they are hidden, so most people don't know about them or can't be bothered to create them.<p>At first I thought Circles will fail like lists because it's too much work. But after playing with it for a few seconds, I realised Circles is going to be a huge win. Why? <i>Because it's too much work</i> and people LOVE wasting time on the internet. And it's fun dragging and dropping people into circles.<p>Whether you're a techie or not, you already know how to use Google+. Even if you want to avoid it, you won't be able to for long because it's going to be everywhere you go from now on.<p>Excuse the awful pun, but this thing's a vicious Circle.",1309424352

My understanding is that the bulk of individuals with severe mental health problems are more likely to be a danger to themselves than others in any case.<p>Your argument seems to presuppose that authorities are inherently evil and trying to inflict harm on the individual. One could certainly make the case for that in some totalitarian regimes, but in a healthy democracy I don't believe that's a sustainable view.

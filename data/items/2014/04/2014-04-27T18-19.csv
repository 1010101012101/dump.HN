7656260,comment,7655942,7656160,8,0,michaelochurch,,,"&quot;Deep learning&quot; has an actual meaning, which is the use of neural networks with multiple hidden layers. (Networks with one hidden layer can theoretically approximate any mathematical function, but it&#x27;s the investigation of deeper networks, with more, that has reinvigorated neural net research over the past few years). I&#x27;m sure it is being misused, but there is a legitimate, technical meaning to it.<p>&quot;Data scientist&quot; seems to be a way for mathematically literate programmers to separate themselves from the teeming masses of commoditized ScrumDrones. It seems to mean, &quot;this person is smart enough to deserve dibs on the most interesting work&quot;. Perhaps it&#x27;s an attempt to back to the R&D culture that existed before biztards commoditized us and our work.<p>Most of the fuss around &quot;data science&quot; makes me think of the Fundamental Theorem of Employment. If you&#x27;re hired for a job, it&#x27;s typically either (1) to do a job the person hiring you can&#x27;t do for himself or (2) to do a job he doesn&#x27;t want to do. Type-1 workers are respected and have autonomy. Type-2 workers are generally ill-regarded (because the boss thinks he can do the worker&#x27;s job). &quot;Data Scientist&quot; seems to be a way for a programmer to say, &quot;Only hire me for Type-1 work&quot;.<p>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a huge fan of the title&#x27;s existence, because most companies use &quot;data scientist&quot; as Biztard for &quot;person who does watered-down machine learning&quot;, but I suppose the current climate is an improvement over the AI winter.",1398624984

I remember from my visits to Edinburgh that people seemed to be much more likely to strike up a conversation with me than at home (Netherlands). Though maybe I just had this open &quot;happy holidays&quot; vibe coming from me.<p>Actually now that I think about it, it was during the Edinburgh festival weeks, which probably accounts for a lot of the openness. In the Netherlands you&#x27;re much more likely to chat with a random stranger when it&#x27;s a national holiday and everyone is out on the streets anyway.<p>My experiences with Danes, however, is a lot more reserved.

7656256,comment,7655948,7656201,8,0,Scaevolus,,,"Yes, but there&#x27;s more going on. Simple hash tables use a fixed hash function-- the order of keys is unpredictable, but consistent between runs of your program. This allows algorithmic denial of service attacks-- if you have a web server that puts querystring parameters into a hash table, and you know what bucket a key will hash to, you can force collisions and O(n^2) runtime complexity.<p>Hash randomization avoids this attack.

The battery bulges enough that the back cover of the phone does not sit properly.<p>* Both devices suffer from charging issues. If you completely drain the batteries, it becomes nearly impossible to charge them. As soon as you plug the device in, it tries to boot, which saps whatever charge it just received.

For people writing such documents,\nTeX is nearly essential.  Before TeX, just the\n&#x27;typing&#x27; could be more work than the\nwork the typing was communicating.  Before TeX,\npreparation of documents with mathematical\nmaterial was grim for authors, typists, publishers, etc.<p>(2) The TeX software has produced almost exactly the\nsame output from the same input on nearly any computer over decades.<p>(3) The software is essentially totally free\nof bugs.<p>(4) Knuth&#x27;s documentation is exemplary.<p>In a sense, TeX is yet another word processing\ntext markup language; \nthe big differences are high quality output,\nespecially of mathematical material,\nand the macro language.<p>For more, TeX was not to cut new\nground in graphical arts;\ninstead, essentially TeX looked backwards, not\nforwards, in that the documents were and are to be \nessentially just black\nmarks on white paper much like huge examples\ngoing back 100+ years on the shelves of\nthe research libraries.  TeX was to\nease the production of such documents and not to\nproduce different documents.<p>So, TeX is not for just everything that\ncan be put on paper, a screen, a cereal box,\nor a billboard;\nit is not for animated foils, animated movies,\ninteractive user interfaces, \nengineering drawing,\nWeb pages, routine text documents,\nroutine e-mail, etc.<p>TeX is not for average customers of Apple or\nMicrosoft Word or some\nhigh end graphical arts software from Adobe.<p>Criticisms of TeX seem mostly to be from people\nwho don&#x27;t need TeX.

I can inter-operate cleanly with alternative libraries and environments, I can adopt efficient host platform ABIs, I can run it with a sandbox or without.

The HN front page has always been a blend of user voting and curation. At no time, ever, was it determined by voting alone. Had it been, HN&#x27;s quality would have been lower—because quality is only one of the reasons why people upvote stories—and HN would never have been HN.<p>Other moderators, including me, worked with PG on this. I started in September 2012. One reason he took so long to hand over primary responsibility for HN, despite unsustainable demands on his time, is that he wanted to be sure that the moderators really grasped what he&#x27;d been doing all along. I&#x27;m thus in a position to assure you that we&#x27;re not doing anything now that hasn&#x27;t been done since basically forever—except that we&#x27;re being a lot more transparent. Even that isn&#x27;t a policy change (pg answered questions when he could) so much as a consequence of there being a dedicated team for the first time.<p>It never occurred to me when I started posting these transparency comments that we&#x27;d get accused of making insidious changes to (paraphrasing) &quot;how HN has always been&quot;, &quot;breaking trust&quot;, and so on.

Fortunately few people argue for new wars by citing the potential for spin-off technologies.  But the logic would be about as good.

Ghandi was not a pacifist in the lay sense.

That is why he won.<p>In the current situation, the fraction of 1% that truly wield global power in our world view us nearly in sub-human terms.

So here, the internalized justification is that &quot;at least this violence is policy driven and under control&quot;.<p>If the layer under the elite balast -- that&#x27;s the middle class -- demonstrates that they are thoughtful & capable of self determination and self ordering, then this order of things will collapse, just like the British Empire.<p>So, it is entirely appropriate to remember that &quot;a people get the government that they deserve&quot;.",1398622100

Still, the examples you gave are kind of biased because you&#x27;re only considering a specific kind of <i>walled gardened</i> sofware, which does one job, but has limited extensibility for further development (although this is intentional for most games).<p>It should be understood when Erik says &quot;does not work&quot;, he is not saying these languages are useless or have no practical use today - he is suggesting that they are incapable of solving the problems of tomorrow. When looking for solutions to the problems we&#x27;re facing now or in future, it&#x27;s useful to have a look at how we actually build software - what are the &quot;units&quot; which make up the bulk of our software, and how do we combine them. Let&#x27;s have a look through the decades and reason a little about what these units were.<p><pre><code>    1940s: Instructions\n    1950s: Subroutines\n    1960s: Procedures/Structured programming\n    1970s: Interfaces over data\n    1980s: Objects\n    1990s: Libraries\n    2010s: Services\n    future: ???\n</code></pre>\nObviously these are only approximations, but they give a fair idea of our industry&#x27;s development. For example objects were in use before the 80s, but they were popularized by C++. None of these were new in their day, but they became the primary units of software which we use in our programs - because it&#x27;s simply too much effort for anyone to write them all from scratch - we are all using other people&#x27;s software in our own.<p>Each stage in this development is an attempt to simplify the previous one, by encapsulating, or hiding the implementation detail, and presenting a simplified interface for another programmer to consume. Part of the idea is that <i>you shouldn&#x27;t need to know the how the encapsulated system is implemented</i>, you only need to consume it in the ways specified.<p>So while people are writing are building all this software on top of services now using Go/Scala/Clojure and whatnot - what languages are people going to be using a decade or two from now to <i>combine</i> these into bigger programs?<p>The suggestion of purely functional programming is one that removes the need to know how the program or service you consume deals with state, because effects are made explicit. The idea of purely functional programming as the solution to multicore/concurrency is a just a <i>consequence</i> of having explicit knowledge of state, because we need it to reason about race conditions.<p>We don&#x27;t really know what the future will be like, but I imagine it will be one where programs are written to be entirely independent of the hardware in which they run - as they will be intended to run in clouds with  heterogeneous architectures - other software will be making those decisions for us, but it can only make them if it can reason about their state. Which suggests we either need to make it explicit, or vastly improve our theorem provers to figure it out for us.",1398622061

But because fibers are not native to the JVM, they do incur some overhead. If the fibers perform no work, then you&#x27;re essentially just measuring the overhead, and Go would perform better. The more work is done, the more the advantage goes to Java.<p>With regards to IO, fiber-blocking IO currently uses the JVM&#x27;s asynchronous NIO (which uses epoll/kqueue) under the covers, unchanged. But Java&#x27;s async NIO is intended to be thread-safe, so there is lots of unnecessary synchronization going on there. The result is about 7% slower than Go. Again, the more computation work you do, the more the performance swings in favor of Java. We can do much better with IO by plugging our own NIO provider (Java&#x27;s dynamic linking everywhere is awesome), but because the performance is really good as it is, it&#x27;s not a top priority for us at the moment.<p>EDIT: the reason I would use Java over Go for all the &quot;serious stuff&quot; isn&#x27;t primarily performance, though.

And when I do, I don&#x27;t even get a copy or receipt of what I agreed to.<p>Call me stupid, but I usually never read T&Cs. As far as I know, my soul could now belong to a lot of companies. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m a unique case.<p>What if websites could delegate the T&C agreement process to a third-party service that does just that. This service could help small businesses create their own T&Cs from templates, standardize the agreement process, let users have access to a list of everything they agreed to, and even let people (or lawyers) review T&Cs to make it easier for others to know what they&#x27;re getting into. If a company wants to change their T&C, the service will notify users of these changes, and let them react accordingly.<p>This service could also be extended to more than just website T&Cs, and became a central hub for all your contracts and agreements, from your bank, phone company, rent, job, contract, etc. One place where you can see everything you legally agreed to in your life.",1398621851

And doing this would prevent this kind of bug from ever happening again.<p>I might be missing something, but this sounds to me very much like a usual test case. :) Having one in a suite of system or acceptance tests would indeed prevent further occurrences of the bug.",1398621836

The kinds of people that would rob a taxi driver probably aren&#x27;t going to have a smart phone and a credit card and are probably doing it to score cash to buy drugs or some similarly short term reward.  In the case where they got their hands on a phone by stealing it it seems unlikely that they wouldn&#x27;t just pawn the phone for cash vs concocting some elaborate scheme to hail a lyft and rob it&#x27;s driver only to find out that since lyft is cash-less there isn&#x27;t much worth stealing that they couldn&#x27;t have gotten by mugging some random passerby on the street.",1398621800

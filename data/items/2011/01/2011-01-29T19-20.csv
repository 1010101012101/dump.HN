2156199,comment,2155654,2156007,0,0,MrFoof,,,"There is one fundamental issue to congestion charges however: You are not paying for the ability to use privileged roads, you're paying to use all roads, because under a congestion charge, all roads are considered a privilege.<p>Carpool lanes work better in this regard.  For example, on 93N heading into Boston, you can use 93N for free.  If you have at least 2 people in the car (and I think hybrids and EVs are allowed as well), you can use the carpool lane.  However, if you were almost always by yourself, but could pay $2000/year to get a placard to drive in the carpool lane, people would certainly pay it.  Motorists without passengers are not required to pay to drive on 93N, however any motorist willing to pay ~$8/workday for the convenience therefore has the option -- that may even exclude the rich, just those who live far enough away from Boston and commuter rail stations where they need the drive (or feel the need to) and are willing to pay for a shorter commute time.<p>Actually, the more I think about this, the more I like it.  If you are actively working towards eliminating congestion by carpooling, you still get it gratis.  If you're reducing emissions by driving an EV or Hybrid, you get it gratis until that allowance sunsets, because you're making a positive impact with your vehicle choice.  Yet if you're willing to just pay... hey, we'll let you in too, so that money can go towards improving something.  I like this.  I'm trying to find how anyone loses with this idea, because you can still use the four lanes on 93 like anyone else does for free.",1296331020

Giving high tax payers an express lane at the DMV smacks of elitism and pandering. But, giving an ""express process"" option for $1k doesn't sound so bad to me. Someone else mentioned auctioning off carpool-lane passes, it's a similar principle.<p>More importantly, it directly ties the cost to the reward. The biggest problem with Adam's system is that if you don't directly tie revenue to entitlements, then the rich would still push for lower taxes, while also wanting to keep the corresponding entitlements. The connection between the two has to be strong enough to resist politics.",1296330775

In reality, it's very simple to derive the reason that murder is wrong: if we're all allowed to go around murdering each other, we'll have to watch our backs the entire time, and collectively, humanity will never move forward. Very utilitarian. No morality about it.<p>> Are you saying that measures against capital offenses, various forms of assault, protection of private property and enforcement of contracts ""do not represent your morality or ethics""<p>Yes, I don't think that John Locke was the absolute end to philosophical thought. ""Private property"" and the accumulation of capital have been the root cause of a large amount of the injustices in the world. Greed is not good. Markets don't work.<p>> Pray tell, then what are your ethics?<p>I'm still working out the absolute details, but I'm most certainly in some part of socio-anarco land.<p>> (with claims as outrageous as these I feel like I'm being trolled, but there are at least two people upvoting you?)<p>It's because you're thinking on the surface too much. For example: America's rape laws are not in line with my morality. This isn't because I think rape is all good and fine, it's absolutely abhorrent. However, in the eyes of the law, an 18 year old and a 17 year old having sex is wrong, and the 18 year old will be branded a sex offender for life. This is wrong. I don't agree with it.",1296329896

There was a knock at the door, some shouting in arabic, a moment of silence then they carried on with the news, perhaps sounding slightly shaken.<p>Take from that what you will.<p>EDIT: Also at one point they had a split screen with their live footage of a burning upturned APC on one side, and the feed from egyptian state TV showing a calm and placid view of the skyline on the other. They then spent the next few minutes roundly mocking the regime for living in a dream world. It was pretty funny.",1296327934

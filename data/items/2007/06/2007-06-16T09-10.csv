28523,comment,27550,27552,0,0,ralph,,,"Yeah, thanks PB.  It's a big improvement and cuts down bandwidth use a lot too.<p>I've peered at the Javascript and most of its obvious even without knowing Javascript  :-)  Might someone answer a few questions?<p>node.href just returns an empty text/html document when fetched. Does this happen synchronously or not? What do browsers do when they're given text/html as the content of an image and what do the specs define they do? When is ping freed? Is it automatic when it goes out of scope and does that suggest that the image fetch is synchronous?<p>I'm trying to understand what delays occur when and whether on a larger scale you'd need to manually free some of these resources.",1181985145

If you all will pardon me for going on a bit more about my site squeezed books, one of the things that is very frustrating about trying to learn something about business, economics, and marketing is that you realize there is this gaping hole in on-line resources compared to what I know and love - computers, where you can do everything on your own.",1181984726

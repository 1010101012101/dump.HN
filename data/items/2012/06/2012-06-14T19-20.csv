Perhaps this breaches the guidelines of Hacker News, although I did not see anything that directly made me believe so.<p>I was born during the early 90's, as many others now breaking into tech careers were. However, I was a little different. I've been engrossed by technology and computer programming since the age of 7, and have developed my abilities for a total of 12 years.<p>I currently work as a software engineer for an enterprise level eCommerce company in the Seattle area. I take on a handful of the work along with 1 other engineer who is my higher up. I've been employed here for approximately 1 year and make a tiny bit over $30,000 a year with no benefits or perks. The average salary for a software engineer in Seattle is a little over $80,000 a year.<p>A lack of experience definitely does not apply to me. I've founded over 5 application startups, 2 of which I've sold, 3 which flopped since I was 15 years old. I've built entire application and scalable database frameworks from scratch, web applications, software, etc.<p>The 2 start ups I've sold:

4113233,comment,4112002,4113150,5,0,aphyr,,,"Calendars are different than time. It's a little hard to think about; maybe this will help:<p>The earth is <i>sort of</i> an inertial reference frame with a single proper time. It isn't exactly, because it's orbiting, in varying gravity, and spinning, and has local gravitational changes, etc, but to a decent approximation you can write down an average time for the whole earth, which is the number of seconds since the epoch. That time is TAI.<p>Calendars and dates are things like ""June"", ""Monday, ""12:40:70.534 PM"", etc. These are human-friendly names for times, and don't have to be precisely comparable. It's OK to have ""12:00 AM"" twice. It's <i>not</i> OK to have ""143563534 seconds since Jan 1st 1970 00:00:00"" twice.<p>Calendars are supposed to line up with things like seasons and days. Those <i>don't</i> last a fixed number of seconds; the earth is always changing. So we need to have a translation between earth-average-time like TAI, and human calendars/dates/times. There are a whole bunch of layers of translation between various time schemes; most of them derive from TAI and add some offset. UTC is basically TAI plus leap seconds, which keep UTC as ""86400 times the number of <i>days</i> since the epoch, plus the number of seconds since midnight."" POSIX time is derived from UTC. Local time is typically derived from UTC plus a timezone offset, which can also be modified by daylight savings time.<p>Those translations need to change and be updated over time, so we insert and remove leap seconds, leap days, etc. It doesn't change TAI, but it <i>does</i> change the mapping from TAI to human times.<p>Back when POSIX was being codified, we made the decision to base most computer clocks on UTC, which is a human time, subject to changes in that mapping. That introduces disagreement over what a given time means, discontinuities, reversals, etc. All of those make it difficult to do calculations around time correctly.",1339703830

There are several stores. You can install standalone APKs if you like. The nature of the platform protects you from the likes of Apple.</i><p>Yes, but it also protects you from the likes of customers and profits. Last time I checked that was still the case with Android vs iOS marketplaces.<p>Do you think developers are idiots that develop for iOS BECAUSE of the restrictions? They develop for iOS DESPITE the restrictions, because a) that's where the money is, b) more high-end devices and latest versions of the respective OS at more end user hands with less fragmentation headaches. Plus, as a API, Cocoa Touch is pretty hard to beat, not for easy of use but for sheer _comprehensiveness_.<p>That said, going with Android could have worked well financially for an app such as this though, where the customers have a real need for it that is more important than their preference in smartphone.<p>><i>You would at least think that they saw why choosing Apple is fundamentally wrong for any person who considers himself free. If you're not free to do with your own property as you please, how much of a free being are you really?</i><p>The concept of freedom, as developed in Greece and Rome, is all about influencing policy and not being under the will of another man. So, a better question would be: if you are not free NOT to work as an employee, i.e not to spend 8+ hours a day under the commands of another, then how much of a free being are you really? Or, if you are not free to have an equal influence in public affairs with Joe Billionaire and Jack Lobbyist, how much of a free being are you really? Furthermore, if half of your life is regulated, from non-smoking laws, to anti-abortion, to whatever, how much of a free being are you?<p>The ""installing whatever on my smartphone"" is really really low in the freedom list...",1339703630

Around 2005, a local guy built a keystroke pattern recognizer utilizing neural networks to learn your keystrokes and was able to correctly identify who you were after a minimal amount of learning (typing).  He brought it buy to see if we were interested in licensing it and using it in our product.<p>While somewhat of a black box demo, we were able to play with the technology.  We tried a ton of stuff to fool the system (physical only, we didn't use keystroke macros or anything like that) and it would correctly identify us every time.  It was showing us the probabilities as they'd change and it was uncanny how it would immediately know that I started typing instead of a coworker.<p>So, it's not only probable/possible/exists, it's only drawback is the lack of necessity.

Unfortunately, most interesting graph analytic problems do not fit into that model because the ""graph-like"" aspect is still limited to problem sizes that fit conventional algorithms.<p>For example, if you can reduce a trillion-edge graph analysis problem into a billion-edge graph plus some other stuff (usually materialized document structures) then you can fit that into something like Pregel. That is how almost all real-world graph analysis is done today.<p>But by doing so, you've lost the ability to do graph analysis on the other ~trillion edges for the sake of tractability in a narrow case. You can't do relationship analysis across the attached documents. There are many, many  graph analytic problems that require a true graph that is orders of magnitude larger than what can be partitioned even after accounting for graph reduction techniques such as those used in Pregel.<p>The Holy Grail is still the ability to run ad hoc graph analytic queries against a massively distributed graph representation. There are no shortcuts around this for many interesting applications. Right now, we are limited to mere billions of edges for most practical purposes and all of the hacks and workarounds are designed to keep the number of true edges to around this number even when the data model is much larger.",1339702934

There is no reason why Go binaries couldn't be much smaller, other than so far it has not been a problem for anyone building systems in Go.<p>>  Today's security environment requires frequent patches to library code.<p>Which is not helped by dynamic linking for reasons both of complexity (see <a href=""http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/dynamic-linking/versioned-symbols"" rel=""nofollow"">http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/dynamic-linking/versioned-...</a> ) and because most programs anyway use their own version of such 'shared' libs (update your system's ffmpeg and chrome will keep using its own copy). Dll-hell has security implications too.<p>In practice people end up doing things that either nullify the alleged benefits of dynamic linking, or simply using static linking (Google deploys statically linked binaries, sometimes multiple Gb in size to their servers).",1339702128

Vinyl is probably a lot worse than film for retaining quality technologically but because of commercial interests, sometimes the vinyl release has far better mastering than the digital release. You can see this with older music, such as David Bowie's original releases on RCA and the later CD versions that are ""remastered"" such that they have a lot more dynamic compression. And you can see it in new releases as well with electronic music, where the vinyl release is targeted at DJ use and the CD one for listening at home, leading to different mixing. So while digital may be strictly better than vinyl in terms of retaining quality of input, due to cultural reasons the input is uneven depending on medium.",1339702060

People are going to have different typing styles depending on their mental and physical state, and their typing styles will change over time. In addition, while the space of <i>possible</i> typing signatures is very large, the space of <i>actual</i> typing signatures is much smaller. So we simultaneously have to assign each person a blob of signature space which is big enough that it can positively identify them regardless of whether they've had their morning coffee (or, god help them, they cut their finger or break their arm), and small enough that we don't have so much signature overlap as to make the system useless.<p>In either case everybody will have to have a fallback password in case their stride is off one day. If the system works well, then that password will be rarely used. A rarely used password is harder to remember than a regularly used one, so people will choose weak passwords for the fallback.<p>So the only way that this system has <i>any</i> chance of working without grossly compromising everyone's security, is if it barely ever positively identifies anyone.<p>Of course, even if it did work perfectly, it would be the equivalent of having the same password everywhere.

I think, if the control were introduced slowly enough and with the right justifications (""security"" and ""convenience"" spring to mind) many users would <i>welcome</i> iOS level restrictions on their general purpose computing hardware. Indeed, we're already seeing Apple move in this direction with its increasingly strict restrictions on App Store purchases in OSX.<p>I hate to be as alarmist as Stallman and co., but I do think the ship has sailed on this one. The only way to guarantee that your device is open is to run an open operating system on it. If this were an Android app instead of an iPad, then the developers could have asked users to install a different app. store (like Amazon's app store) or even offered the .apk for the users to install themselves. It would have been less convenient than installing from Google Play, but it wouldn't have been nearly as difficult as with iOS.",1339700933

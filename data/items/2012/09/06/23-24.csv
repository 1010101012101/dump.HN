If either is true, you're already screwed anyway.<p>I would be more concerned with the fact that fingerprint readers are really easy to foil without any wacky software doing funny things.",1346975999

Our portfolio speaks for itself.""\n</code></pre>\nand<p><pre><code>  ""We've already closed investments on companies from this class,\n  so they don't seem to feel that way,"" Maris said.\n</code></pre>\nNeither of those things mean that what PG is saying is false. Google Ventures is a desirable investor and entrepreneurs would be willing to trade lower caps for a Google stamp of approval on their round. The question is whether it's a matter of their policy to quote a cap at half of a company's existing one, and whether that is an ethical policy. Because they are skirting the question, it certainly makes them look guilty to me.",1346975990

Right now most of the web is ridiculously open and unencrypted. If authorities get the appropriate warrants it's almost guaranteed they will be able to spy on almost anybody doing almost anything because the default mode is unencrypted and nobody really thinks about it. But that default mode is only the default because people think their communications are reasonably private anyway, precisely because this kind of logging is pretty expensive and impractical.  Laws to enforce it will motivate everyone to move to encrypted connections, greatly increase use of VPNs for all non-trivial communications, and ensure that criminals become educated about how to encrypt their activities.<p>If governments around the world seriously pursue this, far from reaping the windfall they are hoping for they will actually kill the golden goose that could be helping them solve more crimes than ever.",1346975885

If you don't, go with Ruby; it's a vastly better language, with a more mature ecosystem.<p>Longer answer:<p>* Scaling and performance is mostly an issue of architecture, and is heavily dependent on what you're trying to accomplish.  You can go a long way just by using varnish/nginx/memcached as appropriate, and serving static assets from a CDN.  The actual language is sort of a sideshow, because no language is fast enough; everything needs to be pre-calculate and cached.<p>* If you don't know either language, you'll probably find that Ruby is easier to learn and become productive with, but it's easier/cheaper to find good PHP developers.  Kind of a wash.  In either case, you will absolutely need to pick and learn a framework as well, which adds more overhead.  (No, you aren't going to write a social networking app in PHP without a framework.)<p>* It's easier to get a basic PHP page hosted, but if you're even <i>thinking</i> about scalability and performance, then you need more than Bob's Discount Hosting.  Doing PHP hosting right is no easier (or harder) than doing Ruby hosting right.<p>Basically, it doesn't much matter.  At the end of the day, <i>most</i> (not all) programmers who have programmed in both detest PHP and love Ruby, and you'll <i>probably</i> find it easier to hire PHP devs.",1346974727

I'm not sure it is by definition OO, it just looks like operator overloading to me, similar to C++'s operator() or Python's __call__.<p>Maybe I'm misunderstanding your broader point - claiming that Scala doesn't support module-level functions implies to me that you feel this is a deficiency, and that it's such an obvious one you don't need to explain why. From my perspective the only reason I care about namespaces is a) that I can namespace my functions and b) so that I don't have to type things out longhand - the exact implementation of namespacing (module-level vs module/object-level) is irrelevant to me, and seems to me to be nearly irrelevant in evaluating if a language is ""really"" OO or ""really"" functional.

This practice should, IMHO, be prohibited by law, and this should be impossible to override via any contract.<p>The entire point of a limited company (in UK terms) structure is that you know you are running a legally separate entity, and everyone else knows they are dealing with a legally separate entity. Everyone should judge the risks they are willing to take and offer terms that factor in those risks accordingly. This is done to incentivise people to start new businesses where there may be some degree of risk, without having to risk literally the roof over their heads to do it, and is universally acknowledged to be in the interests of economic development, which is why every major economy in the world has a concept analogous to that limited company.<p>Checking the credibility of the principals and asking for things like business plans and company financial statements is all perfectly reasonable so that a potential business partner can judge the level of risk. However, allowing piercing agreements is simply a completely one-sided deal: the little guy is now back on the hook for all of the risk, yet still takes the hit on all the bureaucracy associated with running a formal company.<p>If such agreements were banned, the banks and lawyers and other high-powered services would still have to deal with other businesses or they'd have on customers. They'd just have to be more realistic about what they charged if they wanted to continue working with profitable customers in the long run.<p>[Edit: Incidentally, piercing agreements do not seem to be completely universal. We've seen some fairly unpleasantly one-sided terms while investigating payment services, frequently including things like requiring direct control of your main bank account so they can grab whatever they feel like whenever they feel like it, but not everyone has asked for personal guarantees (as opposed to a personal credit check) at least at the stage we've got to with them.]",1346974530

The related RFC 2821, the successor to RFC 821 that is now obsoleted by RFC 5321, is for SMTP.<p>For an example of the kinds of differences this would cause, RFC 5322 (with errata) believes that """"@example.com is invalid (by errata), but hello(ignore)@example.com is (MIME comment); RFC 5321, on the other hand, believes the exact opposite validity.<p>(edit: When I realized that I should probably write a blog post about this, given how much time I've put into implementing this stuff recently, I realized that there was more to say on this general subject, and I'm including it below.)<p>That said, I will go even further: these formats are designed for escaping e-mail addresses in the context of a larger standard and protocol, one that might already have special characters. This is why they contain so much quoting support.<p>This is then why the grammer is often so highly restricted for things that don't need to be quoted: given that an @ cannot be found in a domain name, you really shouldn't need to quote anything to the left of the @ to get a valid e-mail address.<p>However, ""("" is a special character in a MIME field (begins a comment), and thereby if you want to include it in the local part of an e-mail address, you will need to escape it somehow; the same is true of things like whitespace, commas, or angle brackets.<p>The user typing the e-mail address into the form, however, isn't dealing with these restrictions: asking him to escape special characters in his e-mail address seems silly: one might as well be asking people to HTML escape their username in the username field.<p>That said, there is then a separate RFC 3696 which talks about the semantics of contemporary e-mail addresses and how one might go about validating them, and it includes the idea of quoting in its implementation (so maybe it believes that RFC 5321 is king).",1346974319

However Amazon has christened theirs as the ""Paperwhite"" and so several sites I have read have discussed how kobo has released a competitor but it uses the ""older e-ink pearl"" technology.  If anyone has some clarification about the displays I would happy to get more detail, but from the matching resolutions, to the similar device photos on their respective websites, to the description of how the front-lighting is achieved lead me to believe that Amazon is using commodity e-ink technology available to everyone else and christening it as a revolution.<p>Their other claim is that they get 8 weeks of battery life with the light enabled.  Closer reading of the small print reveals that this is going by 30 minutes of reading a day, for a grand total of 8<i>7</i>0.5 = 28 hours of reading with the light.  On their site Kobo claims 55 hours of use with the light on.  Amazon does not say in their comparison if the light stays on for the whole 8 weeks, or just while it is being read.  But either they have achieve an incredible breakthrough in battery life to allow for 8<i>7</i>24 hours of lights or their battery life is 1/2 that of a competitor.  Regardless I have seen several sites claiming that Kobo has some serious catching up to with ""only"" 55 hours of battery.<p>Anyway, just the usual specs jockeying between tech companies, but in this case as an owner of a kobo I was intrigued by the details as I have experience with one of their competitors.  Always interesting to see what gets reported unchecked and what doesn't.",1346972596
4486763,comment,4484106,4486054,1,0,drone,,,"It depends on the design (PTH or SMD).  A lot of PTH takes a lot of people, as many parts still can't be machine-placed.<p>The facility we use an hour from us runs about 600 PTH units (about 40 components/board) on one assembly line with 10 people in about 4 hours.  I doubt one would always work them at that level.  Lead-bending, wave soldering is all pretty much automated.<p>The bulk of an SMD process is done by pick-and-place, our stuff gets run on 10,000+ CPH machines. You need one person to load/de-load panels and switch out feeders - and one person can work multiple machines if everything is set up right.  The machines in general are really good these days.<p>Printing and machining the PCBs takes some time, but this is a process that can flow continuously once you let a little backlog build up at each stage.  Electrical testing can be slow at the back-end, as is polishing board edges, packaging, etc.<p>I could see it taking 30 people to do 10k a month, but the same 30 people possibly capable of 60k+ a month.  It depends on where you load them in the process.  The more SMD the more volume you can get up to the testing/packaging stage.  rPi is mostly SMD, with some PTH - so they have to mix the processes, but its really hard to avoid...)<p>Notably, however, if you look at the Hackberry (which I like better, btw!) the vast majority of the connectors are SMD.  I wonder if the rPI could see some labor savings (at higher BOM) by switching to them.<p>One thing we've been working on in-house is making big automated jigs to program and test entire panels of devices at once, before they're de-paneled.  These are really expensive to make though (think $5k+ per jig) - but they save us thousands of hours of labor a year. We're moving to make machines that can do it without jigs now.

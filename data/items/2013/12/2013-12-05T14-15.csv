The law is in itself a solution to society&#x27;s demands, each of which can have a more or less justified base. It just so happens that the current law system become exposed to abuse (along with the lack of proper maintenance that should have kept it simple and accessible). The article successfully exposes a blatant legal loophole and its exploits, with concrete examples (with consequences that were later felt in a way or another by all of us). Its a shame to just dismiss it, especially with such a vague stance like yours.",1386255585

A phone that&#x27;s 4 years old (i.e. pre Gingerbread era)?  Apple has done a pretty good job of allowing phones/tablets to be updated, with the iPad 1 being a big exception.<p>What Google is doing is helping but the ideal solution would be to have people be able to upgrade their mobile devices for at least 3 years.

The other instruments are ultimately owned and controlled by the individual.<p>You are typically limited to using the 401k your current employer offers if you want an employer contribution (which has a vesting schedule) and pre-tax investing, but when you change employers you can roll the money into another retirement instrument.  The flip side is all responsibility for investment management, or even having retirement savings, is on the individual.

In theory, the compiler ought to be able to analyze a goroutine, determine that it shares no data at startup with another process (i.e., nothing in a closure or something), determine that it only communicates via value-passing channels (which courtesy of my previous restriction, can be analyzed by simply looking at what channels are passed in at startup time, and some analysis of the types of the channels), and thus guarantee that at least <i>this</i> goroutine is fully isolated. Pervasive usage of the new keyword I&#x27;m hypothesizing would allow a diligent programmer to recover most of the isolation advantages without having to rewrite Go entirely. It also ought to enable some other optimizations against these guaranteed-isolated goroutines, the biggest of which is that they no longer need to participate in a global stop-the-world GC, both in that they can continue running while that is occurring and that they also relieve the global GC from the task of scanning over them.<p>(In fact all the analysis ought to itself be fully automateable, and the user shouldn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to declare it; I&#x27;d want them to still have the option to make a declaration so the compiler can tell them if they screwed up, though.

It&#x27;s a 200 year old administrative artifact, removed from every aspect of law, except patents.<p>The assumption of the 19th century patent system was that everything that should be patented already was patented already; therefore, when you would bring a invention to the office, the correct way to determine whether it is novel is to ask whether it is novel in light of the art already in the office. When asking whether it is obvious, you are essentially asking whether the very semi-skilled form of art knowledge possessed by the patent examiner would have regarded this as a natural extension of the existing art deposited in the office.<p>In other words, determining a patent comes down to searching the patents offices&#x27; own archive. If the old patent texts would be so lucky as to say: &quot;To unlock the cellphone, the user’s finger moves across the touch screen&quot;, it won&#x27;t match when Apple adds the word &quot;continuous&quot;. The patent examiner is forced into a position where the least resistance is simply to grant Apple the patent.<p>This system is not working. The patent office archives do not have every iteration and written description about everything. By certainty, they won&#x27;t have all the implied descriptions. As such, one should not assume that it is efficient to do an binary determination - 0 or 1, novel or obvious or not - on the basis of the consultation of the patent offices&#x27; own administrative records.<p>The simple change suggested by the article would only remove the ability for companies to brute force a claim phrase so it does not match exactly something in the patent offices&#x27; archives.

6854373,comment,6852423,6853995,5,0,dmytrish,,,"That&#x27;s very true from both compiler and OS point of view. Intel machine code is so kludgy: variable-length codes, subtle differences in prefixes in different modes, exceptions in register handling all over the place, plenty of addressing modes for memory access, special machine codes for a qualified register (`mov %ax` code differs from `mov %cx/%dx/%bx/...`), more lengthy encoding for more often uses (like `mov (%esp)` requires SIB byte whereas it&#x27;s not true for all other registers) and so on.<p>From OS perspective, it&#x27;s also  overcomplicated: switching from real to protected mode is an exercise in doing every action in a long chain properly and in the right order or the whole undertaking fails. Remapping  IRQs into interrupts that do not mess with the CPU internal exceptions, weird legacy memory layout with BIOS, a slew of CPU modes (real/protected/PAE/long/etc), crazy format of entries in Interrupt Descriptor Table (where four bits of a pointer may be stored separately from the main part), where bits are often used differently for different contexts; redundant built-in features like poor multitasking support (Linux and other sane kernels try to avoid it as much as possible, but it&#x27;s still is not possible to go into kernel mode from userspace without filling kernel stack pointer into a TSS entry), memory segments (in protected mode, where a pointer can address the whole virtual memory unlike real mode), four privilege rings (whereas all modern OSes use two: 0 for kernel space and 3 for userspace).<p>All that does not feel like it should be and often it only gets worse.",1386252077

I&#x27;ve written a unix-like OS for ARM 2 years ago as a final project for an OS class I took on campus. There were 20 other people in the class, and all of us forgot to update the IDT at some point. It was a common mistake, so for this article to emphasize it like it&#x27;s some bug that takes 2 days is just lame.<p>Imagine if my blog post would talk about my experiences with building an HTML page, and how it took me 2 days to change a <p> element to a <div>. Let&#x27;s get serious here.<p>How long will it take the author to write a circular buffer to read and write characters to the UART? A month? That says nothing about the difficulty of the actual task.<p>You know, when it comes to writing operating systems, I like to think of this quote: &quot;it&#x27;s hard, it&#x27;s harder than it looks, but it ain&#x27;t THAT hard&quot; (I first heard it when the commentators were laughing at Chris Andersen was struggling to dunk in an NBA Dunk Contest).<p>If you&#x27;re interested in writing an OS, make sure your primary source isn&#x27;t some blog post. My textbook was Tannenbaum&#x27;s Operating System book, and it&#x27;s a very solid book that I can recommend. Tannenbaum knows operating systems. He&#x27;s not going to tell you how hard it is. He&#x27;s going explain all the details to you and, when you understand them, you&#x27;ll think how easy kernels really are.<p>Good luck!",1386252063

OpenGL ES 3 and WebGL 2 are beginning to emerge and are based off of OpenGL 3. In my experience shaders that work with WebGL will also work with OpenGL ES 2 and OpenGL 2.1. Equivalent versions tend to use the same concepts. On the other hand, code written for desktop (v3+) won&#x27;t work on mobile, because the desktop version is one version ahead of mobile (and I imagind that it will be for several more versions).",1386252024

After close examination of the metal, they&#x27;d discover it was a sintering process, because sintered metal has a recognizable structure.  They&#x27;d quickly figure out it was built up layer by layer by some deposition and heating process, because the layers are visible.  Lasers were known in the 1960s. Even kilowatt-sized lasers existed in the 1960s, although they were big and involved chemical reactions.  Numerically-controlled milling machines were known, although they were really clunky and usually involved paper tape readers, rather than direct computer control. Scanning electron microscopes were available by 1971, so it was possible to look at the fine structure of a chunk of metal. So the whole process might have been figured out. With enough money, laser sintering might have happened in the 1970s. It was actually invented in 1981, by a grad student looking for a project. (<a href=""http://www.me.utexas.edu/news/2012/0712_sls_history.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.me.utexas.edu/news/2012/0712_sls_history.php</a>) It took a long time before it worked well, but that could have been accelerated with money.<p>Making a model by laser scanning with structured light was a known process in the early 1970s. It was used by Ford Motor to get from clay models of cars to metal dies used to stamp out body parts.  Previous approaches involved plaster casts and mechanical tracing machines.<p>However, a computer tablet was beyond 1970s technology to even analyze, let alone duplicate.",1420606797

I&#x27;m pretty far removed from anything Kindle/Fire related, but this was my best guess at what happened based off of the Amazon I know:<p>Jeff said make a phone (probably like 5 years ago). They pulled orgs apart and mashed them into this superorg with several VPs and dozens of Directors, with the software teams in Seattle but the hardware folks in a completely different city, and then told them to work it out. In the course of working it out, the hundreds of cooks elbowing each other in the overcrowded kitchen resulted in delay after delay, with the final feature set being a mashup of 40 different director&#x27;s flagship bullshit-o-tron that they expect to be promoted for (OMG...everybody is gonna think useless 3D stuff that kills the battery is so coool...I can&#x27;t wait to be reporting directly to Jeff!!!). Come crunch time, the product managers all schedule their SDEs to show up to a 2 hour meeting so they can discuss the same exact plan to ship on time that they discussed yesterday for 2 hours.<p>Now that it is a dud, nobody wants to touch it, so all the Directors/VPs migrate laterally to different orgs (or quit) and then rinse and repeat.

I&#x27;m pretty sure they already thought out their alibi, but this still could be a really messy subject. I&#x27;m also pretty sure that if they were honest about the real business plan behind 23andMe from the beginning, much less than 800,000 people would&#x27;ve spit for them; that&#x27;s some really low foul play there and definitely &#x27;evil&#x27; [1].<p>The reason why this is huge is because DNA (and samples) can be easily and cheaply preserved for relatively long time (which is what they obviously did). Right now, whole genome sequencing is &#x27;apparently&#x27; still very expensive but there&#x27;s not a doubt that it will become ridiculously cheap as time goes on. If 23andMe is completely authorized to do whatever they want with those samples (which I&#x27;m pretty sure they do, because I can&#x27;t think of something more flagrant than selling their data) there&#x27;s nothing stopping them to sequence all of them when the cost is low enough. What happens next could be the subject for many science fiction novels but it&#x27;s real. If they do sequence those samples they would have BY FAR the largest amount of genomic information that humanity has ever gathered together; along with capable researchers, this is the kind of thing that could change the fate of our history. And... this tremendous amount of knowledge and power is all going to be in hands of a private business, a business with very dubious ethics and &#x27;very close&#x27; to another company that  makes it&#x27;s living taking advantage of every piece of data they can put their hands into. This needs regulation like RIGHT NOW.<p>Also, from the comments:<p>>In essence, 23andMe got you to pay for their startup costs, and now they&#x27;re looking to make a mint on the personal data you paid to give them.<p>[1] For those who are not aware. 23andMe&#x27;s founder and CEO is Sergey Brin&#x27;s SO.",1420606102

I&#x27;ve tried looking for open-source projects to contribute to, but have honestly had a really hard time finding projects that I could benefit.<p>I&#x27;ve had one quite large project that I managed to get through the family of a friend which involved developing quite a large PHP site with a lot of functionality (I used Laravel & OctoberCMS [http://octobercms.com] as a starting point).

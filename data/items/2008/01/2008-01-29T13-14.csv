106140,comment,106020,106020,0,0,dazzawazza,,,"I'll preface this with ""I used to work for an online poker company and every mofo in the planet used to attack our network""<p>Firstly consider what type of target are you. Most DDoS attacks are launched for a lot longer the 30 minutes and they are certainly not regular. They are looking to see if they can bring you to your knees so they can blackmail you. Is your site that valuable? If so forget everything and get yourself a cisco firewall and pay someone who knows what they are talking about. Cisco are expensive but if you have a valuable site that 1% of real traffic needs to get through.<p>Assuming your not in a position to be blackmailed: As other ycombo's have mentioned logging and blocking are your friends but be careful. You say it's mysql taking the time despite caching. Looks to me like you've found a bug in your code (or at least your caching). Log what these IP blocks are requesting. If it looks algorithmic then the chances are you've got a crawler ignoring your robots.txt. Contact Purdue. Call them up (they will ignore your email) and ask them what's going on.<p>You could chose to block these ip ranges but if you make your site weather this storm it will be stronger in the future.<p>Good luck",1201614812

106138,comment,106047,106047,0,0,tptacek,,,"Having been directly involved with multiple first-tier PR firms in my career to date: you can spend $1000, $10,000, or $50,000 in a year on a PR firm and still get nothing.<p>Here's the thing. PR firms are not magic. If you have something interesting to cover, you can get it covered in the trade press (or Techcrunch or whatever) without a PR firm. On the flip side, if what you have is not naturally interesting, the trade press isn't really going to cover it even with a PR firm.<p>In my experience, the ""value"" PR firms offer includes:<p>* Two-hour long meetings about company positioning and the values you want to communicate to the press<p>* Press training (note: actually valuable)<p>* A PR landscape assessment where they tell you that you care about Techcrunch, ComputerWorld, Wired, and Slashdot, and your competitors were mentioned N times last year<p>* A snippet service wherein a human being will do the job of Google News Alerts for you, mostly by means of using Google News Alerts<p>* A filing service for your press releases<p>Apart from press training, which you don't <i>need</i> and can only use if you're getting in front of the press, there's nothing that a PR firm does to get you covered that you can't do just as effectively yourself, regardless of what PG says.<p>My company has gotten pretty good coverage in the press, by which I mean that my company has gotten more coverage in some trade pubs than successful public company competitors. Here's my take on what to do:<p>* Blog. Many trade press reporters skim blogs for leads.<p>* Court controversy. Take sides on every issue you can reasonably take sides on.<p>* Figure out things to do with your product or service that will be newsworthy. Your product or service is itself probably not newsworthy.<p>* Court Reddit aggressively. I kind of doubt Reddit has any trickle-down effect into paper PR --- or even Slashdot --- but if you're reading YC, the people you want to reach are probably easiest to address with Reddit votes.<p>* Secure speaking opportunities. Make a calendar of every event in your space throughout the year, put together a set of abstracts, and cold call. Short of having printable intel on the most recent Apple security vulnerability, nothing gets press hits like speaking slots. (Imagine a PR person trying to allocate a slot for you at a technical conference --- they actually try!)<p>* Figure out who the people who actually write stories in your space are, and make friends with them. More on this, but not much more, in a sec.<p>Here's what I think doesn't work:<p>* Press releases. There may be value in getting into the habit, but we stopped doing this real quick. Remember: the only reason for you to issue press releases is if you honestly think someone will write it up. If you want to do it, you can get a PRNewsWire account for cheap (or use a ""free press release"" service). The advice you will get is, look at an Apple press release and copy as much of it as you can, so that yours looks professional.<p>* Cold pitching stories to editors. This doesn't even work for PR people (witness all the companies who drop $50,000 for 200 printed words a year and, if they're lucky, an pay-for-play ""op-ed"").<p>In the past few years, we've figured out a bunch of things that have gotten us closer to the press. I'm not about to give them up, but I'll tell you the (obvious) theme: be helpful to the writers. Writers are (a) on a deadline and (b) looking for interesting stories. What you have to say is probably not interesting, but that doesn't mean you can't help with both (a) and (b).",1201614615

My personal ""signal to noise coefficient"" would be in the 90's.  For reddit, it was once in the 60's or 70's, but those days are long gone.  Two of the things that changed that are the posts about politics and religion.  I know this board is about things that interest hackers, but I'd hate to see the same thing happen here.  I imagine that it takes a certain amount of TLC to keep this board's quality so high.<p>As a startup hacker, I have to be very careful how I spend my time.  Personally, debating sports, politics, or religion are total wastes of time.  The cost is priceless; the benefit is worthless.<p><resume proper time expenditure mode>",1201612944

(which is actually goodbye = hello.lines[3].words[1]) is ridiculous. The HyperCard phenomenon though is something  that should be researched by psychologists, because I myself, too, saw it many times how a complete non-techie gets something working in an hour or two. They get it quickly and ""amazing"" is just not the word. No other programming tool is as good at that as HyperCard.<p>And like the rest of the old good Apple stuff HyperCard can be traced back to Xerox PARC: that's NoteCards, a Lisp-based hyper-text system, according to Wikipedia.",1201611840

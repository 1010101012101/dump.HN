If you do/don't have a card but do have a twit id a simple app to notify people you have met & manage the contacts (as long as you remember/record/contact their twit handles) - sort of an online business card. Stacks of contact apps have been built like this way but linking both the online/offline would be innovative.<p>But nothing beats having something physical to put in someones hand without the need to sling out your phone/computer.

I think jacquesm has the right idea but muddles it a bit: all great design is sold, not delivered like a pizza. And great design is very much worth selling, for the effect it can have on the world. While selling can seem distasteful (it certainly doesn't come naturally to me), it's a critical skill for designers, entrepreneurs, and founders. Selling is design.<p>""But is this really MY problem?"" In presenting design ie. communicating its value, the roles/responsibilities are not unlike that of a teacher and students: successful delivery of information is the responsibility of the sender. To say eg. ""I taught it to  them but they didn't learn it"" is a contradiction in terms tantamount to ""i sold it to him but he didn't buy it."" You as the designer are responsible for 1. understanding the problem landscape well enough to deliver a working solution 2. building a decent relationship with the client (internal or external) that you have a good communication channel.<p>What are the best ways to sell design to non-designers? Clear objectives you've agreed upon and stuck to. Compelling storytelling. Competitive benchmarks. Pure visual WOW factor. $10 usability tests. Man-on-the-street impressions. Rote logic. Brute force. These are the techniques that I've used successfully. They can of course be combined, and there must be many others. ymmv<p>If ""selling"" design is problematic and you're not able to push work through to some kind of test environment where real customers can connect with it to PROVE the design works (via sales / leads / engagement, whatever the objective may be), then you might consider joining forces with a fellow writer or designer, or  agency, to watch how designers and creative directors successfully bring clients on-board to sell innovative designs.<p>CAVEAT: There are always critics and naysayers of any sufficiently innovative solution or design.

The mining tax was the last act in a long play of dropping promises, reneging on commitments and policy backflips.</i><p>I agree with this<p><i>The mining tax was a disaster and, in it's original form, was reverse nationalism by stealth. The government was going to tax profits above 6% with a 40% 'super tax' - terminology straight from a Marxist script. They were then going to reimburse Miners for losses on projects. In reality, with the government participating in 40% of the profits and 40% of the losses, it was a part-nationalisation by stealth.</i><p>I agree the mining tax was a disaster, but it wasn't as bad as you are making out. The 40% thing was always something that got the headlines, but as you point out it isn't as simple as that because it would have reduced state based royalties.<p><i>The reason the mining tax was so rejected, particularly by the mining states, was that it was to replace state-based mining royalties with a Federal mining tax.</i><p>This is true.<p><i>The mineral states stood to lose power over their own revenues, and the non-mining states stood to gain income from activities that took place entirely outside their borders.</i><p>This is also true, but not necessarily a bad thing. Australian urban centres are a long, long way from the mines and some form of distribution probably makes sense.<p><i>The tax was beloved by pro-government tax-raising types and lovers of economic theory and hated by pretty much everyone else.</i><p>I don't think the tax was loved by anyone except Rudd's kitchen cabinet (and possibly only by 3 out of them too, judging from how quickly Gillard backed off it).<p>But the goals of the tax are perhaps more broadly backed. The original article touched on the fact that many mining companies avoid investing in the communities (as you'd expect from a profit making entity), and this has caused some issues. From the article:<p><i>One of the local councils in the Pilbara, Shire of Ashburton, recently refused permission to Rio Tinto to expand its camp around the Tom Price mine. Instead the company has been asked to invest in facilities that will remain after the mine is closed, to spend $247 million on housing, an air strip, and other infrastructure at the town of Pannawonica. This kind of investment, and the employing of locals, is the only move that is going to convince skeptics like Tony Wiltshire.<p>""We were at a town meeting the other day when a representative from a mining company said, 'Come on, we're all up here to make a dollar.' The locals in the room looked at each other and thought, 'What?' We live here. We can cope with the hot summers. We're here for the long term. We are actually better for the multinationals than the contractors they fly in and fly out. We just need them to wake up to the fact that they, and we, are all in it for the long haul.""</i><p>The idea of the tax was to formalize this kind of investment. The way they went about it was probably the worst planned example of domestic politics in Australia since WW2, though!",1283729076

I don't think the cloud is defined by where the service is hosted or even how the service is paid for. To me, cloud computing is defined by 3 big ideas.<p>1. Virtualization is key. I think the cloud is marked by a construction from dynamic pools of virtualized resources.<p>2. Instead of focusing on individual physical components, the cloud focuses on pools of compute resources. This seems to have led to higher priority for service delivery.<p>3. Finally, I think the cloud is defined by being convenient for the consumer instead of being convenient for the provider.<p>Within those constraints, I usually call a cloud private if it is under the control of an enterprise IT organization, in a way similar to older systems. I think of the cloud as public if the provider is mostly in control instead of the tenants.<p>With that definition of the private cloud in mind, the model offers a lot of advantages to larger IT departments. The private cloud allows IT teams to more quickly provision resources in support of business initiatives. It's also a better way to invest in IT infrastructure. The model is inherently scalable, which means that IT funds can be used to create value instead of keeping the lights on so to speak.<p>Obviously, private clouds aren't for every IT organization, but I think the private cloud has merit. As organizations globalize and just generally get big, economies of scale can be leveraged internally to increase the quality of IT projects and services.",1283727798

Share with one click. Works on desktop too. Get free robot build-instructions each month.<p>Techie Mindstorm robot owners have posted cool pages and videos that show them controlling their NXT robot with their iPhone or Android phone. These are one-off demo projects that require significant hardware and software programming and tweaking abilities. Other less techie NXT owners have asked how they could do the same because it's cool.<p>Kleekbots is a service that lets people control their robot with their smartphone instantly and requires no tweaking or programming. And more.<p>We are beginning to see a trend that converges physical toys with smartphones, devices and social networks.

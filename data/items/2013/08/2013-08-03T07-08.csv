6151463,comment,6151319,6151319,2,0,mryan,,,"> Bloggers post content which is sold to readers, and readers can profit by promoting the good content to other people.<p>One of the problems with this model is that the incentive for sharing content is to get paid, rather than to share genuinely good content. The system will be gamed by people who are sharing as much as possible without regard for quality.<p>At the risk of sounding elitist, the types of people you want sharing your material are not the same types of people who will be excited about earning a few cents by sharing an article.<p>> This model has proven to work, and it is now time to bring this model to the greater online community.<p>This model (paying for access to content) is already available to the greater online community in the form of paywalls. They are not popular unless the content is very good and can not be accessed elsewhere.<p>> Good content is a commodity worth paying for.<p>I agree with this, but who is paying? It appears that you will buy articles from bloggers and pay readers to promote them. So where does the money come from?",1375516560

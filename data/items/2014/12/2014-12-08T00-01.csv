Instead, when a position opens up, the hiring manager looks at the pile of resumes that are already on file.<p>For that specific reason, I applied to companies based on whether I&#x27;d like to work there, rather than whether they had any openings.  One such company interviewed me immediately, but waited two years to actually hire me.  That job actually worked out really well.<p>I don&#x27;t actually know but have reason to believe that that&#x27;s not commonly the case anymore.  That is, my impression is that companies don&#x27;t solicit resumes unless they have a specific opening.<p>From time to time I find a &quot;Jobs&quot; website that specifically says &quot;We are not accepting applications at this time&quot; or &quot;We have no open positions&quot;.<p>By contrast, some others will say &quot;We are always looking for great people, please send us your resume&quot;.<p>One might at first think that it&#x27;s not a big deal for a position to be unfilled for a period of time.  But consider that a company typically expects an employee to be worth twice their pay.<p>That is, if a software engineer is paid $100,000.00 per year, then to be considered truly qualified for their job, they must write $200,000.00 worth of software during that same year.<p>That&#x27;s not $100,000.00 of pure profit.  Actually that&#x27;s the breakeven point - that is, writing $200,000.01 worth of code in a year would yield one cent of profit!<p>There are considerations of office space leasing, all manner of other costs like the equipment and software the employee requires, telephone, internet, electricity.<p>That &quot;twice your salary&quot; figure isn&#x27;t specific to coders, my understanding is that that&#x27;s regarded as the rule of thumb for the value of every employee, in every line of work.",1417999876

After having that experience, any reasonable person would say, &quot;This is crazy. I&#x27;m going to do something else with my life.&quot; Many of my classmates did say that.<p>But when does this grief stop?<p>A few months back I had the task of implementing the receiving end of what was basically a single-sign-on scheme. I had to use SAML. If you don&#x27;t know that that is, consider yourself lucky -- or, just google &quot;I hate SAML.&quot; That was one of the early hits I found when I first began researching the subject.<p>In the end, the implementation wasn&#x27;t all that difficult. But the documentation was another story. The overview documents were buzzword bingo; the spec was an exercise in tedium; the libraries were poorly documented; the mailing lists were horrible. The complaining of people on the Internet about all this was demoralizing. When I finally figured it out and got it working, I felt like the payoff was poor compensation. It was just too much frustration for what I accomplished.<p>Programming has its share of this kind of frustration. (So does systems administration.) Just taking your average manpage as an example, we work in an industry where people have no capacity to explain anything to someone who doesn&#x27;t already understand. A programmer needs inquisitiveness, yes; but that inquisitiveness needs to be steeled by an unreasonable amount of grit.<p>If programming were full of nothing but the fun of for-loops, it would be for everyone. As it is though, I perfectly understand why many otherwise smart and capable people choose to do something else.<p>I love Python; but maybe using it as an introductory language -- in college, no less -- is a little bit like luring children with candy.",1417999739

I don&#x27;t think a mere &quot;mention of the need for caution&quot; could have saved anyone here.  Handcuffs and a straightjacket on the Debian developer might have been required in this case.<p>This link covers it well:<p><pre><code>  What can we learn from this? Firstly, vendors should not be 
  fixing problems (or, really, anything) in open source 
  packages by patching them locally – they should contribute 
  their patches upstream to the package maintainers. Had 
  Debian done this in this case, we (the OpenSSL Team) would 
  have fallen about laughing, and once we had got our breath 
  back, told them what a terrible idea this was. But no, it 
  seems that every vendor wants to “add value” by getting in 
  between the user of the software and its author.

  Secondly, if you are going to fix bugs, then you should 
  install this maxim of mine firmly in your head: never fix a 
  bug you don’t understand. I’m not sure I’ve ever put that 
  in writing before, but anyone who’s worked with me will 
  have heard me say it multiple times.

Over and over, colleagues of mine have lost the leading zero in a string because Excel automatically typed it as a number, or had a cell value interpreted as a formula, or had a VLOOKUP not work because the number is typed as a string or vice versa.  These problems often have counterintuitive solutions, and for a basic user, these issues exist in both excel formats and in csv.  Excel has pretty robust ODBC integration that drives data directly into Pivot Tables or through VBA.  In this way you can provide informative (and pretty) reports to end users, with dynamic aggregations, filters etc.  If your users are more technical than that or require more detailed atomic data, the widely compatible solution is generally csv.

You&#x27;ve got to control your brakes and turn the steering wheel. If you release your foot from the brakes the car will surge forward as it is not limited by the transmission.<p>Plus water, snow or ice downhill with brakes = danger, very easy to lose control of the car. Again if you&#x27;re limited by the transmission it&#x27;s a non- issue.<p>Plus it makes your brakes hot, which makes them less efficient in case of emergency (I think).<p>Your transmission should always be the limiting factor of your speed, period. That&#x27;s it&#x27;s job, to determine the speed of the car. 
The brakes are only here for when you couldn&#x27;t downshift fast enough and you&#x27;re going to hit something if you don&#x27;t stop the car.

Because there are three (3) trains a day, leaving at 6 AM (nope), 12 noon (meaning you spend the whole workday on the train) and 6 PM (well, this one&#x27;s semi-decent, although it&#x27;s past 10 PM by the time it arrives).

If I&#x27;ve parsed your description correctly, we get no info about our opponent&#x27;s actions or the results until the end.  Absent any ability to observe their strategy, it seems like you do want to maximize for expected value of your own actions, and I&#x27;m curious about the counterexample.<p>How do we maximize EV?  A single throw&#x27;s pdf is 1, for x in [0,1], so its EV is 0.5.  The question is how to improve on a single throw by deciding to re-throw.  A re-throw is independent and gives the same EV.  We want a strategy that gives us higher cumulative EV.  Say our strategy is that we have a threshold A, where we re-throw any result below A.  Because x is uniform, the probability that we re-throw is also A.  The cumulative EV of the strategy is A * EV(second_throw) + (1-A) * EV(keep_first_throw).  Since we only keep the first throw for results in [A,1], the EV for that event (integrating x * pdf from A to 1) is (1+A)/2.  So EV of the whole strategy is A/2 + (1-A) * (1+A)/2.  It has max EV when A is 0.5, giving EV of 5/8.<p>So how do you do better?",1417997229

That&#x27;s not something unique to PHP at all.<p>This is not what the parent means. In PHP you get a crappy shared hosting account, and copy a file up to the server via FTP and it works. This is not possible with Python, Ruby, etc... you need to do more server setup in most cases. Sure this is due to historical reasons and maybe not specific to &quot;PHP the language&quot;, but that is the situation that most beginners face. It&#x27;s a very simple mental model as well. Services like Heroku kinda/sorta make it simpler for Ruby/Rails/etc., but understanding how those work and getting the command line tools set up is mentally more complex to a beginner.",1417997141

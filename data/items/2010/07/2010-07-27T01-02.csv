Lacking examples, it's super tough for people to see it.<p>Second, the math I'm talking about is not often taught, even in the best US research universities.  It's rock solid math, but it's just not very popular.<p>So people are missing both the examples and the math.  So, the whole thing looks empty or worse.<p>Sorry 'bout that.<p>I'm telling you the truth, but I can't explain it better than I did.<p>If many people readily understood the work, then the business opportunity would no longer be there.  A good business opportunity and difficulty understanding it are love birds.<p>Broadly this situation is not very surprising:  Anyone talking advanced math in Web 2.0, etc. is doing 'field crossing', but that technique, say, using clipper ships to bring pepper from India to Boston, make enough in one trip to pay for the ship, has to its credit a major fraction of the best business successes.<p>So, bringing math to Web 2.0 is field crossing.  I'm here to advise you, for the future of cheap cores, etc. in business, a major key is selected work in math; I tried to give the reasons at a high level, e.g., about 'information'.  Maybe someday I will underline this point with an example.  For now, that's the best I can explain.",1280195810

Reddit's traffic, like most sites of its kind, probably peaks during lunch hour during the workday and probably peaks at 5x that number. So we're looking at 815 pageviews per second. Given 80 servers total, we're looking at 10 pageviews per second per server.<p>Let's compare this with Facebook. In October 2009, Facebook announced they had 30k servers[0]. In September 2009, there was a rough estimate that Facebook served 200 billion pageviews per month[1]. That implies 73k pageviews per second, or 2 pageviews per second per server. Clearly the pageviews are a rough estimate, but even if facebook served 1 trillion pageviews per month they still wouldn't be beating reddit for efficiency.<p>I have a feeling if you run the numbers for any other highly dynamic site at scale, you'll find that amortized over <i>every</i> server in use, you won't get a lot better than 10 pageviews per second.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2009/10/13/facebook-now-has-30000-servers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2009/10/13/faceb...</a>

Clearly the iPad is gaining momentum, as time goes on more people are planning to buy one (at least for now).<p>2) More importantly, Forrestor said that ""no time frame was specified in the survey question"".  So they asked people who don't own an iPad if they intend to buy one.  That's fairly different from our question, which allowed the respondent to choose from:<p>1) plan to buy one
2) want to play with one first
3) will wait for later versions
4) waiting for the consensus opinion<p>Clearly, with the variety of options, some people who might have simply answered ""yes"" to the ""intend to buy"" Forrestor question would pick 2, 3 or 4 in our question.<p>Does that settle that?  And by the way, these are people who wanted to take a personality quiz, not answer a poll.

But recently I've realized that, even though it's addictive, I don't really find it all that relaxing.  So I've been trying to reclaim my old ground state of reading books.

You can move from interesting factoid to personal anecdote to hilarious cat macro without ""wasting"" any time on background or depth.<p>I think the counter-addiction technology will have to be psychological.  Perhaps research could determine if certain practices make people more resistant to addictive things, and it could become customary to have such a practice.  Meditation, self-hypnosis, ritual, counseling, introspection.  Maybe just doing things that are hard.  I suppose there is a danger that any of those could become addictive.

Even older games such as Portal or Half-life 2 run about 50% faster under Windows & Direct3D on the same hardware.<p>I've developed with both Direct3D and OpenGL on multiple platforms for most of the past twelve years, as well as using platform-specific APIs like libgcm on the PS3.

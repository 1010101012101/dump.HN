She was a partner at the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas (which famously represented the Madison Guaranty Bank, that was involved with the Whitewater scandal).<p>She also sat on several corporate boards:<p><i>&quot;...she also held positions on the corporate board of directors of TCBY (1985–1992), Wal-Mart Stores (1986–1992) and Lafarge (1990–1992). TCBY and Wal-Mart were Arkansas-based companies that were also clients of Rose Law. Clinton was the first female member on Wal-Mart&#x27;s board, added following pressure on chairman Sam Walton to name a woman to the board. Once there, she pushed successfully for Wal-Mart to adopt more environmentally friendly practices, was largely unsuccessful in a campaign for more women to be added to the company&#x27;s management, and was silent about the company&#x27;s famously anti-labor union practices.&quot;</i>[1]<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton</a>",1414259987

It&#x27;s trying to relate too many concepts from taxation theory to economic stimulation to labor management, etc, etc.<p>If the main point is to ask if capital or labor risks more the answer is trivial: capital. There is a -100% downside for investment and minimum positive earnings for labor. On the other hand capital has an unlimited upside, while labor does not.<p>A more interesting question would be how to you optimize the opportunity between capital and labor?",1414259985

It comes from the wealth created by Labor.  Workers work and create wealth, and get to keep the first few hours worth of wealth they create.  The last few hours of the day, they are made to work for free, with the dividend checks and profits sent off to these heirs and such.<p>Why should labor cooperate with these parasite heirs who suck off of their wealth-creating ability?  Labor hasn&#x27;t historically, and doubtless will in the future.  Capitalism is the fourth major economic system the world has seen, and a rather unstable one.  Marx said crises like 2008&#x27;s $700 billion TARP bailout were harbingers of an eventual total economic collapse, and I for one believe that - one day the economy will go into the ditch and no bailout, New Deal or libertarian type solution will get it going again.",1414259730

Stocks are generally such assets and the disposition of stocks results in capital gain income (or capital losses).  Apples are not intended for investment; they are intended for consumption.  Ergo, the sales of apples results in normal income.  (Note that for stockbrokers, stocks are also treated as inventory because by definition they are not in the business of holding stocks for investment.)<p>Buying and selling stocks as a day trader is not the type of capital trading that governments want to incentivize, so they treat income arising from this type of activity as &quot;short term capital gains.&quot; In most countries, including the US, short term capital gains are taxed at the same rates as normal income, which is the scenario that would apply to your day traders.  Consequently, the day traders and apple sellers are taxed in essentially the same manner.<p>It is only if capital assets are held for a sufficiently long period of time (in most countries 1 year, though in some countries as little as 6 months) that the true capital gains rates apply.  This is where the day traders may come out ahead--if they hold on to some of the stocks traded for at least 1 year.",1414258200

See also &quot;free speech zones&quot;. (No, I am not saying that that&#x27;s quite the situation we are in with facebook (yet), but that freedom of speech is more complicated than &quot;you can speak somewhere&quot;).<p>&quot;For me the strong linkage that Facebook does with my identity (and between me and others) has great value. It&#x27;s a public place more than a private one, and for private things I go elsewhere.&quot;<p>I do appreciate the difference between private and public places and the use of identifying people for certain purposes. What I disagree with is total surveillance of public places, and also the unconditional requirement of identification. If I go outside, I don&#x27;t expect to be invisible - that does not mean that I am ok with having to always wear clearly visible ID and an officer following me and recording everything I do and say. The same applies on the internet.<p>&quot;A big part of the value-add in FB is the general assumption that &quot;you are talking to this specific person that you have met in real life&quot; (say high school friends). Some identification server at the least and centralisation.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think you absolutely need any centralization for that at all, a web of trust in principle should do, I&#x27;d think. But in any case, a central authority for that purpose certainly wouldn&#x27;t need to be more than a directory server that provides a mapping between &quot;real&quot; and &quot;online&quot; identities - essentially a phone book. There is no reason why such a service should be able to read all your communication, to see how much you communicate with whom, to track which websites you visit and like, to collect photos of you, ... and all the other stuff that facebook does in addition. Also, such a service would not need to have any network effect, as it should be perfectly possible to operate multiple such services competing with each other without that being an obstacle to the user, if the actual communication is independent from the identification service.<p>&quot;Genuinely curious as to any ideas you might have on this. Did you have anything in mind? Or is it just speculation.&quot;<p>A bit of both, I guess?<p>One part is &quot;just&quot; speculation, though with some grounding in reality: If you have a system with a strong network effect under the control of a single entity, that tends to lead to a (de facto) monopoly. And monopolies tend to not be particularly supportive of anything that might weaken their position, such as commoditization of their service, and also have rather limited motivation for innovating themselves. A historical precedent of this would be the telephone operators in many countries: In some places, you were forbidden from connecting your own modem to your phone line in order to dial up some BBS, because the operators themselves were offering some new &quot;interactive digital services&quot; or whatever that usually were less interesting and more expensive than the innovation of BBS networks. Or more recently, mobile providers have been keeping internet access excessively expensive in order to protect their SMS business, and lateron telling their customers that they couldn&#x27;t use the internet access for instant messaging. And in any case, starting a new service directly on top of the telephone or mobile network is difficult. Compare all that to the internet: It&#x27;s a commodity by its very design (though some telcos have been trying to reverse that recently, see net neutrality), and it&#x27;s absolutely trivial to start a new service - anything that can use a TCP connection you can just do, no need to ask anyone for permission, no need to convince anyone it&#x27;s a good idea, no need to change anything about the network to support your new service, just do it.<p>Long story short: Centralized services with a network effect tend to be an obstacle for innovation because they prevent competition.<p>As a specific example to think about: How easy would it be to put an encryption layer on top of facebook? How easy might it have been on an open, distributed system?<p>The other part is the fact that a lot of (public) social interaction nowadays happens on facebook, and anyone who values their privacy is effectively excluded from that. What effects does that have on democratic decisionmaking, for example?",1414257632

The fundamental &#x27;conceit&#x27; [technical term] of the essay is incredibly well-worn, and it is surprising to see it reproduced here so uncritically.  There is one substantive and interesting claim, based on research by two scientists named Wayne Gray and Wai-Tat Fu:  “externalized knowledge is accessed like any other memory, and that we treat ‘memories’ on a computer screen just like memories in our head.”  This is joined to the suggestion from Edwin Hutchins that the ‘cognitive task’ of navigation at sea was socially distributed across “several people, charts, papers, clocks, and a variety of physical instruments.”  As ships in truth use GPS, and used radio beacons before then, and as in truth a single man with a map, a compass and sextant can <i>roughly</i> determine the position of a ship at sea, this sounds suspiciously like a thesis that is picking and choosing its own Scotsmen.  What exactly makes a distributed task be <i>cognitive</i> rather than, say, a computation?  I do not think that this is answered, and it seems that the entire idea never gets beyond an “A implies B, C implies B, therefore A is C” fallacy.<p>Anyway, what excites the author is the idea that this external cognitive process extends seamlessly into the internal cognitive process by way of the aforementioned findings about externalized knowledge.  There is no real notion beyond that.  He believes that as the city population grows larger and denser, the “genius” of the metaphorical city mind will increase;  he cites strong evidence that this is true, but he attributes the solved logistics and communications of a large city to that genius, no matter that a mind is capable of no similar thing.  If “people are to cities as neurons are to brains,” and based on the power-law scaling he mentions, he logically ought to end with the fear that all large cities will be eventually destroyed by massive epileptic cascades.  Instead, he does the usual soft-shoe across different scales and concepts to freshen up an old and familiar imagination of science.<p>I have no idea why this is about San Francisco, although the golden gate bridge is quite obviously a corpus callosum.",1414257159

If we go by the logic that one shouldn&#x27;t pay the same tax twice, then it&#x27;s capital gains, because income tax has already been paid on the money used to invest.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this is the wrong conclusion -- that the income of day-traders selling and buying stocks should be taxed as capital gains -- but it seems to me that this constitutes favoring one profession over another.<p>Surely, if I earn my living buying apples cheaply and selling them for more money, my income would be taxed as income, and not capital gains.

8508728,comment,8508382,8508606,0,0,gamblor956,,,"Capital gains taxes are not savings taxes.  They are taxes on <i>income</i> arising from the disposition of capital assets.  They are subjected to lower rates than normal income to incentivize capital investment income streams over normal income streams.<p>Only a few countries impose savings taxes (also known as &quot;wealth taxes&quot;): France, Spain, the Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland. There might be two or three more that I&#x27;m missing. Wealth taxes are intended to prevent the concentration of wealth by essentially forcing a minimum level of capital investment by the extremely wealthy.<p>In your example, the person who earns and saves $100 is not taxed any differently than the person who earns $100.  The saver has not invested any capital (yet), he is simply sitting on the money. Both were taxed at the appropriate tax rates (0% or their applicable marginal rate), so both have the same amount of money.  If the saver then invests the money in a capital producing asset, when he later disposes of the asset, he <i>may</i> be taxed on the gain, if any, he recognizes on the income (i.e., the increase in the price of the capital asset over the price he paid for it).  If the saver sold the capital asset for the same price, or for less, he is not taxed on the sale--in those situations, he is not treated any differently than the spender.  It is only if the saver realizes a capital gain that he is subject to a capital gains tax, and when he is, he pays a far lower rate on that income than he would if he had earned the income (max 20% rate vs 25% rate or higher assuming saver is above the poverty line).",1414256993
8508727,comment,8508382,8508606,0,0,legacyfruit,,,"Agreed.  The primary reason economists argue for taxing capital gains, is that income can be disguised as capital gains.  Startups are probably the best example of this.<p>Even this reason, however, is probably exaggerated.  Suppose for example that the CEO owns 10% of a company&#x27;s stock.  While they have a greater incentive to work hard, there is also no reason to think the stock price will rise faster than any other stock (by the efficient market hypothesis).  This apparent contradiction is resolved by that fact that the market already knows that the CEO is incentivized to work hard.  So as long as the CEO isn&#x27;t awarded shares <i>before</i> it is announced publicly, the capital income from these shares should be no different to any other share.<p>The same applies to startups, however in the case of the startup there is no market signal so it is easier to cheat accounting rules and claim that the value of the awarded shares are lower than they really are.",1414256987

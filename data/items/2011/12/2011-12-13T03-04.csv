of math, insanity, and consciousness like the story in the main article.<p>A synopsis for others to decide if they want to read it:
Chloe is a beautiful humanoid companion. Deliberately implanted
in the programming of her mind is a minor reasoning defect.
Whereas an ordinary person could live with it, and perhaps
not even be aware of it, Chloe cries and has fits whenever
she becomes aware of the flaw in her chain of thought.
A psychologist is brought in to figure things out.<p>By the way, ""Sample 27"" is the title and not the
27th sample story from the author as I originally thought.<p>A suggestion to the author: You might want to either not
use HTTPS or buy a certificate. I don't think it's a barrier
to Hackernews readers but most people won't get past

If there's a big difference in how good two people are at on-the-spot negotiation, often the less-good person will end up just not saying much, or feel coerced into something, while over email they might've hashed out an agreement. On the other hand, some people good at face-to-face discussion are really incompetent emailers, so that can also have downsides. I'm very unconvinced there's a clear ordering of what you get from each; you get different things out of different people from different modes of communication (same with phone vs. IM, to take another huge-variance example).<p>I actually find the people I know best are people I've IM'd with a lot, for whatever reason.

So why is that?  It's simply because I'm male.  Nothing more.<p>The truth is, a lot of the philosophy of the academic system is due to the monasteries that preceded it.  If you're not married to God (I mean, ""physics"") then you don't truly love it.  Which is balderdash, of course - but academics are some of the most sexist people in the world, and truly believe the place of the faculty wife is in the kitchen and picking the kids up at school, while her husband is doing all the smart stuff eighteen hours a day and getting ahead.

There was also a severe thunderstorm warning in effect (with a lot of lightning) so we decided to go back to work instead of riding our bikes home in a tornado.  Being rather inebriated, we did not do much work.  Instead, we wandered around the building and found the telepresence rooms.  We wondered, ""how do we link these up and have a conference"".  There was a phone in each room, and they had some digits on them, so I went to the other telepresence and punched those digits into the phone-like device there.  Connected!  We then had a conversation for a good hour or so; it was so much like real life that it wasn't worth the effort to get up and walk back to the other room to have a ""real"" ""in-person"" conversation.  There was no latency.  Eye-contact was eye-contact.  Everything was the right size.  The displays may have even been Retina Displays; I didn't notice any pixels like I might when watching HDTV.<p>So all in all, not bad when done right.

5934565,comment,5932815,5933925,2,0,protonfish,,,"I think throwing the term &quot;emotion&quot; around closes discussion because it is such an ambiguous term. A better model would be reason versus obedience - do we believe our own senses or what we are told? Non-science is rooted in charlatans and manipulative &quot;leaders&quot;. We should be examining how people choose who they believe to be authoritative. Then again, appeal to authority is a known logical fallacy so any conclusion based on an &quot;expert&quot; is suspect.",1372096773
5934564,comment,5932493,5932493,1,0,31aEuL4HEAg,,,"In one news report today (time.com blog), some US official tried to attack Snowden&#x27;s legitimacy as a proponent of &quot;transparency, freedom of the press, protection of individual rights and democracy&quot; because of Snowden&#x27;s choice of the countries through or to which he is said to be travelling.<p>That reasoning seems rather weak.  One might guess the Obama Administration is getting desperate.  Behind the scenes, this president could be as bad as Nixon.  He&#x27;s better looking, a good speaker and generally likeable, but, like Nixon, he&#x27;s hell bent on secrecy.  What&#x27;s he hiding?  If it&#x27;s nothing, then maybe that&#x27;s eveidence that even innocent Americans can keep secrets and there&#x27;s no need to spy on them.<p>Anyway, following that US official&#x27;s reasoning, every time some American visits, say, Cuba on their vacation, does that mean they do not support various principles of democratic society?<p>I see more than a few comments suggesting Venezuela is defective in various ways compared to the US&#x27;s democracy.  But are they really that bad (what about all the countries who are worse?)... or does a certain government that needs oil more than any other on Earth (guess which one) have particular labels for Venezuela that aim to further the US&#x27;s interests in (destabilizing or stabilizing a given regime) in order to get access to Venezuela&#x27;s oil?<p>Here&#x27;s what Carter thinks about Venezuelan elections.  He doesn&#x27;t seem to think it&#x27;s that bad.  The voting part of their elections: &quot;free and fair&quot;.  The press: may be manipulated by best funded campaigns.  But we see the same type of thing in the US, of else campaign funding would not be such a pertinent issue.<p><a href=""http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/06/19/3460412/andres-oppenheimer-carter-will.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/06/19/3460412/andres-oppenhe...</a><p>If you look on his foundation&#x27;s website, you&#x27;ll see them acknowledge there is no universal, worldwide definition of &quot;a democracy&quot;.  Look at the database they compiled on the countries they&#x27;ve studied.  The concept of &quot;a democracy&quot; is a compilation of many factors, from many sources.  Maybe democracy is more like a continuum of &quot;less democratic&quot; to &quot;more democratic&quot;.",1372096765
5934563,comment,5933422,5933422,1,0,danbruc,,,"What about this? Why not only grant a patent if you can prove that you invested a considerable amount of time and/or money to come up with the invention? This protects the often cited expensive research done by pharma companies and puts a stop to all the patents on problems with trivial solutions once you have to deal with the problem. And you still have the first-on-market advantage if you are the first to come up with a trivial idea although you have no patent for it.<p>Can you think of good examples where this will not work, where we really should grant the patent but coming up with the invention was neither time consuming nor expensive? Of course, proving how much the invention cost you and that it could not have been done with considerably less effort is a non-trivial problem on its own.",1372096755

But a $NATIONALITY implying that the US is worse than their country, or most countries, should acknowledge other countries&#x27; abuses from hundreds of years ago when they are complaining about US abuses from hundreds of years ago. Otherwise that comparison and that criticism is not very honest and should be replaced by more broadly scoped statements rather than singling out the US in a way which is essentially dishonest, for propaganda.<p>Important corollary: it certainly doesn&#x27;t defend current misbehavior of any other country to invoke ancient problems of the US. If you pay attention, you will see many examples of this. The status of the US as &#x27;world police&#x27; seems to make it attractive to defend anything you&#x27;re doing by saying the US is worse anyway.<p>1a. No, but that&#x27;s irrelevant. The US is not Ariel Castro. You can&#x27;t prove that the Hendersons are a terrible family if their problems are on par with the problems of almost all similar families.<p>2. How do you propose to &#x27;punish&#x27; the US? Who will carry out the punishment? Do you think doing this will improve the US somehow?<p>If natural cause deaths dwarf murders, then efforts to extend lifespan will likely see a better return by focusing on natural causes than on murders. Similarly, if the average person is much more likely to see serious quality of life issues from natural causes. This doesn&#x27;t mean nothing should be done to prevent murders, but a choice between two interventions of the same cost should be made based on benefit.<p>Punishment after the fact is not a reform, it is at best a deterrent and more typically revenge. Applied to international interactions, your &#x27;punishment&#x27; is liable to be a war in which atrocities are committed against the &#x27;prosecuted&#x27; nation.<p>If you are going to justify war or massive sanctions against the US then please come out and do so openly rather than beating around the bush with stupid metaphors.<p>3. When you blame &#x27;Americans&#x27; you blame all the Americans. Your argument fails spectacularly when applied to anyone who did not receive inheritance or did not descend from slavers.<p>4.

After Bradley Manning was kept in conditions that are considered torture, and after prisoners in Guantanamo, having been kept without trial for years after Obama said he was going to close it down, went on a hunger strike only to have themselves force-fed so the government can keep them alive to continue rotting in jail, surely Snowdon will receive a fair and public trial where the facts in evidence will be used to ascertain his guilt or innocence without any interference.<p>The actual likely result is he will be declared a traitor, enemy of the state, and a spy, accused of espionage, and thrown in a cell without actually being charged with a crime for years.",1372096449

For a large amount of people, especially for minorities and other groups in the past, contribution to the long-term well-being of humanity was not the goal. Some people had to watch as their children or parents were taken from them by war or sometimes trade and slavery. Perhaps those people sought revenge and reunion. Others were born into extreme poverty and prejudice. Perhaps they seek equality. Others were born into abundant wealth and perhaps they seek to amass more wealth and take advantage of a money-driven world. Yet other were born into internment camps and reservations. Maybe they continue out of ancestral pride or out of a sense of justice and reality. Because of nature of humans (i.e., greediness and hatred), in my opinion, the long-term well-being of humanity is a feeble goal meant for Engineers and Scientists for the most part.<p>At the same time, as Stephen Fry points out here, some people continue because others won&#x27;t allow them to quit. Or, in a lot of situations, they can&#x27;t quit without throwing the lives of their families and friends into a gambit.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m more of an Absurdist or Nihlist, and I don&#x27;t really see much of a point to life.

Since that time, these encroachments have continued to increase, and further forbearance ceases to be a virtue...<p>The General Government, as the common agent, passed laws to carry into effect these stipulations of the States. For many years these laws were executed. But <i>an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery</i>, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution. The States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa, have enacted laws which either nullify the Acts of Congress or render useless any attempt to execute them. In many of these States <i>the fugitive is discharged from service or labor claimed</i>, and in none of them has the State Government complied with the stipulation made in the Constitution. The State of New Jersey, at an early day, passed a law in conformity with her constitutional obligation; but the current of <i>anti-slavery feeling</i> has led her more recently to enact laws which render inoperative the remedies provided by her own law and by the laws of Congress. In the State of New York <i>even the right of transit for a slave has been denied</i> by her tribunals; and the States of Ohio and Iowa have refused to <i>surrender to justice fugitives</i> charged with murder, and with <i>inciting servile insurrection</i> in the State of Virginia. Thus the constituted compact has been deliberately broken and <i>disregarded by the non-slaveholding States</i>, and the consequence follows that South Carolina is released from her obligation...<p>We affirm that these ends for which this Government was instituted have been defeated, and the Government itself has been made destructive of them by <i>the action of the non-slaveholding States</i>. Those States have assume the right of deciding upon <i>the propriety of our domestic institutions</i>; and have denied <i>the rights of property</i> established in fifteen of the States and recognized by the Constitution; they have <i>denounced as sinful the institution of slavery</i>; they have permitted open establishment among them of societies, whose avowed object is to disturb the peace and to eloign <i>the property of the citizens of other States</i>. They have encouraged and assisted <i>thousands of our slaves</i> to leave their homes; and those who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to <i>servile insurrection</i>...<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.civil-war.net/pages/southcarolina_declaration.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.civil-war.net/pages/southcarolina_declaration.asp</a>",1372095967

I would not be so hasty to decide that it&#x27;s not &quot;a threat to the US&quot;.  It&#x27;s a big deal as to what constitutes a &quot;public use&quot;, by and large, urban complaints over gentrification are exacerbated because cities will declare whole neighborhoods &quot;blighted&quot; and then turn it over to a politically connected rich guy to bulldoze and flip for wealthier tenants.  One might argue the <i>kelo</i> case just got a lot of attention because Suzette Kelo is a white woman.

Despite my objection to patenting, given that it&#x27;s constiutional and legal, I disagree with the SCOTUS decision, that the PCR product (cDNA or otherwise) is actually an artificial molecule by any reasonable definition of molecule and should be allowed to be patented.  More subtly, I think it is Congress&#x27; responsibility to decide whether or not genes (in the fashion of myriad&#x27;s patents) should be patentable.  So it&#x27;s an example of crafty lawyers (myriad&#x27;s lawyers) extending their de jure power (using &quot;composition of matter&quot; patents to de facto become &quot;gene&quot; patents).  And then the SCOTUS comes and creates this convoluted judgement about cDNA vs PCR, and introns versus no introns, which speaks to my point about how the court (probably not deliberately) works to incentivise legal cleverness, further justifying the existence of its own profession - possibly at the expense of society&#x27;s broad interest in having a <i>simpler legal code</i>.",1372095039

I would argue, however, that you are significantly overreaching by implying that one should never take advantage of advanced features of your RDBMS. While the OP&#x27;s problem was rather easy to solve in the application layer, there are many problems where that approach is absolutely unreasonable.<p>As an example, I&#x27;m currently working on a project that involves modeling a directed cyclic graph in the database. Trying to pull the logic out into the application layer is simply unfeasible. There is no performant way to do it, period. However, it&#x27;s easy enough to work with it in the database, either by using a function that performs a recursive query, making a materialized view out of that same query, or using triggers to maintain the transitive closure in a table proper.<p>You also seem to have a pretty narrow perspective of the situations in which RDBMSs are used. As it happens, there are a lot more use cases than &#x27;persistence layer for web apps&#x27;, and in many of those use cases the idea of not using advanced features of your RDBMS would be absolutely ludicrous.<p>I do agree with one complaint made in another reply to your post, which is that version control, testing, etc. are much more difficult when your logic is residing in the database. There are a lot of solutions out there for that, though (migrations alone solve many of the headaches), so it&#x27;s really not a knockdown argument. As for portability, the SQL itself is as portable as any SQL is. WITH RECURSIVE was added to the standard in &#x27;99.",1372094687

I have several problems with that:<p>1. The whole idea that you can actually with your belief systems decipher what is good for all and then actually do it. History is littered with people who have terribly damaged the world; everyone of them (from the African dictators who slaughtered for freedom) probably thought they were doing good.<p>2. Why <i>does</i> humanity need to continue? Why of all the species that have come and gone and will keep doing that are we so special? Are we particularly nice to each other? God, no. Are we particularly more brutal than other species out there? I think probably not; more inventive, yes; but about the same in terms of brutality.<p>3. Does the Universe particularly care about whether you the snowflake exists or not? Probably not. It is unfeeling, uncaring and simply is.<p>Ultimately, life is absurd and finite. The finiteness everyone is aware of; even those who are too wrapped to be aware of the absurdity. There are a few options then why people continue:<p>1. The promise of an afterlife; sadly not convincing any more.<p>2.

In the mean time they are pests in society by their idleness, and the depredations to which this leads them.&quot; [1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=JefLett.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=230&division=div1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=JefLett....</a>",1372093626

So, in &quot;knowledge&quot;\nthey keep each other informed\non their thoughts, feelings, concerns,\ndesires, etc.  In &quot;caring&quot;, they\nactually, actively care about each other.\nIn &quot;respect&quot; they respect the other\nperson, e.g., don&#x27;t regard them\nwith contempt or to be manipulated\nor exploited.  For &quot;responsiveness&quot;,\nthey &#x27;respond&#x27; to each other,\ne.g., don&#x27;t do what was long in the\nSunday newspaper cartoons of the\nwife talking to the husband\nover the breakfast table\nand the husband behind a newspaper\nrepeating &quot;Yes, Dear.  Of course,\nDear.  That&#x27;s right, Dear.\nThat&#x27;s nice, Dear.  Yes, Dear.&quot;.<p>Then take these four &#x27;attributes&#x27;\nand evaluate them for couples you\nknow.  If the couple gets a bad\ngrade on all four, try to short\nthe stock of their marriage,\nif it is possible to do that!\nOr be very cautious about marrying\none of their children!<p>That little scorecard can give some\nsurprising results:  Can discover that\nsome couples are going along for\ndecades with what externally to\nthe community looks like a good\nmarriage but according to the\nscorecard really would like to\nknife each other in the back!\nOr, people can put on some really\nbig acts.<p>There&#x27;s more, from Fromm, and still\nmore if combine Fromm with some\nother good sources (of which\nI know only a few).<p>Here&#x27;s an exercise:  Watch &#x27;Roman Holiday&#x27;.\nThere the reporter Bradley\n(Gregory Peck)\nand Princess Anna (Audrey Hepburn)\nwere from the beginning basically\nlying to each other about whom\nthey were but slowly mutually\nbut silently worked past the lies.\nThen evaluate the scorecard:\nThey did great.  On each of\nthe four, they started off okay\nand then grew to a grade of A or A+.\nThen they were in love.  Otherwise\nthey showed it by only quite\nsubtle means, but it was \nconvincing and enough.  The\nwriter (Trumbo), director\n(Wyler), and the actors did\nfantastic jobs.  Fromm&#x27;s scorecard\nwins again!<p>People really in love will likely\nbe doing well on Fromm&#x27;s scorecard\nwhether they have heard of the four\nitems or not.  If they are not in love,\nare pretending to the public to be\nin love, and\nhave not heard of the four items,\nthen there is a really good chance\nthat their act is not working and \nthey are showing that they\nare not in love by getting bad grades\non the scorecard.<p>I doubt that Trumbo or Wyler\nhad read Fromm, but they knew enough\nabout love to give a really good\npresentation of it including on\nFromm&#x27;s scorecard.<p>Note:  I call Fromm&#x27;s four attributes\na &#x27;scorecard&#x27;; I doubt that Fromm\never did!<p>That Fromm&#x27;s little four item\nscorecard can look like X-ray\nvision through the public\n&#x27;presentation&#x27; of couples\ntrying to pretend in public\nto have a good marriage is to me\namazing and astoundingly valuable.\nSome of the best information about\nanything I ever got.<p>One more exercise:  The first item on Fromm&#x27;s\nscorecard is giving knowledge.\nWell, that is a form of &#x27;intimacy&#x27;.\nIf you are in a romantic relationship\nwithout intimacy, then you are in\ndeep trouble!  On the other hand,\nif meet a girl and soon she is\ntelling you lots of things \nfrom between her ears, then that&#x27;s\nintimacy and inviting a romantic\nrelationship.  I&#x27;ve been in \n&#x27;romantic&#x27; relationships where\nthe girl was much more open about\nwhat was between her legs than between\nher ears.  Or in &#x27;Roman Holiday&#x27;, they\nstarted between their ears and\nslowly worked down to, say,\na nice hug and a kiss.  In real life,\nit can be much more common to start\nbelow the waist and maybe move up,\nmaybe never get above the shoulders,\nand only rarely get between the ears.<p>Or, in middle school\nit can appear that a lot of the mothers\ntold their daughters to stay away\nfrom boys, not to talk to them:\n&quot;Don&#x27;t tell them <i>anything</i>.  If they\nask &#x27;why&#x27;, just say &#x27;because&#x27;.

5934195,comment,5932608,5933954,24,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>a cleaner solution is to deploy configuration changes from scratch, by deploying clean-slate instances with those changes made.</i><p>All of us who have built big cloud-server clusters have dreamed of this plan at least once. But there are big practical problems.<p>Relaunching infrastructure is easy in theory, but from time to time it becomes very difficult. There is nothing like being blocked on a critical upgrade because your Amazon region has temporarily run out of your size of instance, or because the control layer is having a bad day, or because you&#x27;ve accidentally hit your instance limit in the middle of a deployment, or...<p>A much bigger issue is that bandwidth is finite, so &quot;big&quot; data is hard to move. This is a matter of physical law. It&#x27;s all well and good to declare that you&#x27;re never going to apply a MySQL patch in place: You&#x27;re just going to launch a new instance with the new version and then switch over. But however fast you manage to launch the new instance (and you will be hard put to launch an instance faster than you can apply a patch and restart a daemon...) you will be limited by the need to copy over the data. Have you ever tried copying half a terabyte of data over a network in an emergency while the customer is on the phone? It is <i>very</i> annoying. Because it is often physically impossible to do it quickly: Cloud infrastructure isn&#x27;t generally built for that, and when it is it costs money that your customer will not want to spend for the luxury of faster, cleaner patch-application.<p>A solution to this is to use cloud storage like EBS. Now your data sits in EBS and you just detach its drive and reattach it to a new instance. That actually works okay, provided you&#x27;re happy with the bandwidth and reliability of EBS, which lots of people aren&#x27;t  and, as those people will cheekily point out, you have now solved the &quot;relaunches are slow&quot; problem by replacing it with an &quot;everything is uniformly slow&quot; problem. Moreover, detaching and reattaching EBS volumes isn&#x27;t instantaneous either. You have to cleanly shut down and cleanly detach and cleanly restart, and there&#x27;s like 12 states to that process, and all of them occasionally fail, and if you don&#x27;t want your service to go down for thirty seconds every time you apply a patch you need a ton of engineering.<p>Which brings us to the other problem: Complexity. Most programmers are not running replicated services with three-nines-reliable failover that never breaks replication. But even if you are, because you&#x27;ve got the budget for excellent infrastructure and a great team, it will always - for values of &quot;always&quot; measured in several more years, anyway - be more complicated and risky to fail over a critical production service than to apply, say, a security patch to &#x27;vi&#x27; in place on a running server. &#x27;vi&#x27; is not in your critical path. If you accidentally break &#x27;vi&#x27; on a live server (<i>and you won&#x27;t, because vi is older than dirt and solid as a rock</i>), you will have a good laugh and roll it back. Why risk a needless failover, which <i>always</i> has a chance of failure, when you could just <i>apply the damn patch</i> and thereby mitigate risk?<p>At Google scale that argument probably stops applying. But most people don&#x27;t run at that scale and it will take decades to migrate everyone to a system that does, if that even happens.<p>So, &quot;dustbin of history&quot;, maybe, someday, but in the long run we are all retired, and I will be retired before our dream becomes reality. ;)",1372093354

You serve your country by striving to make it better.<p>I guess to me patriotism isn&#x27;t telling everyone else how much better you are than other countries, it&#x27;s constantly reminding yourself how much better your country can be, and striving to make it happen.  Don&#x27;t need to be in the military to do that, and sometimes going into the military might be counter productive to that goal.",1372093223
5934178,comment,5930494,5933237,2,0,MichaelGG,,,"There seems to be a drive in some of the core standards to allow as flexible &quot;human&quot; encoding as possible. Instead of writing a tight-as-possible encoding, it&#x27;s like it becomes a game to see how complicated yet still unambiguous they can make syntax.<p>HTTP and SIP, for instance, have ridiculous parsing rules and tons of edge cases. The SIP authors even put together a &quot;torture test&quot; RFC where they take glee in making the most insane messages that still parse. And when they don&#x27;t parse, they suggest the implementation infer the meaning. Seriously.<p>HTTP and SIP allow newlines in headers that get consumed in parsing, so you can manually word-wrap lines. They allow <i>comments</i> in HTTP messages. SIP (HTTP too?) allows headers _in the URL_.<p>When a non-committee (TCPIP) or non-academic (SPDY) entity does a spec, they tend to remove a lot of this cruft and realise that human-readability comes second (unlike in programming languages).",1372093221

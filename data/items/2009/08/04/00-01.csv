740430,comment,739735,740198,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Who said the point of a partner is to help you find an idea? The point of the partner is to force you to explain your idea with enough clarity and detail that you realize how much it sucks. Then you look for a slightly different idea. ;)<p>No question, you can work on your idea without a partner. That's the <i>problem</i>. You'll risk spending dozens or hundreds of hours on your pet project before showing it to anyone with the incentive and the social position to tell you that it won't work. Your friends won't do that. They like you. They don't want to hurt your feelings.<p>Worse, when you <i>do</i> find out that your idea doesn't work, you might become despondent. Too despondent to notice that all you need is a few tiny tweaks and suddenly things will be fixed. But there's nobody to help you find those tweaks, because nobody else understands the project. Your friends and loved ones don't get it. It's just you, alone with your problem. By the time you get ahold of yourself and get sober enough to realize that your project is salvageable, days or weeks might have gone by.<p>You can try to be objective about your own work. But be warned: Not only is it likely to be less effective, but it's torture. It's the source of the emotional roller coaster that entrepreneurs so often complain about -- the one where you're euphoric one minute and despondent the next.",1249347511

They produce no emissions (other than wear on tires and brake pads) at the tailpipe. They cause minimal wear and tear on roads. They take up much less space than cars, both when traveling and when parked. Regular cycling is associated with several extra years in life expectancy, reducing lifetime medical costs for cyclists.<p>Also, the cost or providing cycling infrastructure is only a tiny fraction of the cost of providing automobile infrastructure. You can construct a permanent, continuous cycling network in a city for about what the city's road system costs in maintenance for one year.<p>In short, bicycles produce almost no negative externalities and significant positive externalities, so it makes no sense to punish people for cycling with financial or regulatory barriers.<p>Further, as the rate of cycling goes up, the rate of cycling casualties goes down, and the overall casualty risk for cyclists is lower than for motorists; so it is in everyone's pragmatic interest to encourage as much cycling as possible.",1249345190

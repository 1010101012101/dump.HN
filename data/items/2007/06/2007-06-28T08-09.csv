That'd improve the advice you'll get tremendously.<p>My suggestion is that you get your hands dirty. See how much progress you can make. Be tricky: take short cuts, use open source software, use third party services, etc. If you're genuine and inventive in your effort I bet you can create at least a prototype. That's not just sketches on cocktail napkins, it's actual progress towards your goal.

It's all about execution - the execution of the idea, that everyone in the world has, is the key to success.<p>So, all of that just to say - you'll get more offers if you actually tell us what it's about.

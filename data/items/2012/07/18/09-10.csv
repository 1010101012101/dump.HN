4260086,comment,4259441,4260002,7,0,chao-,,,"<i>The government used to not be spying on me... In the last 5 years, it became likely.</i><p>I'm going to pick on the 5 years & 10 years estimate, if you don't mind.<p>If no one was spying on you then, it was because you were a child or teenager, and presumably not very interesting. If you were someone of major consequence five years ago (2007, to keep things in perspective), or even a decade ago (2002), you'd surely have at least a minor notation, blurb or profile somewhere. If our government wasted time and money tracking John Lennon in the 60's, it's hard to imagine that by 2007 there wasn't at least cursory analysis available about anyone with a job and credit card. Never mind anyone who attended college/university, purchased car insurance or signed up for a grocery store rewards card.<p>Let me be clear: I'm <i>not</i> saying the government is specifically tracking on your grocery bill. Instead, you're letting someone else do so, and the data is simply available upon request from most reasonable actors.<p>Further temporal perspective: Google had long gone public by 2007, and people were long crying foul on privacy with respect to it. So the government may not have even been the first to open some unbeknownst profile on you. It may have just been some data aggregator who put your SSN, DoB and address up for sale after your general practitioner's secretary got some malware (I'm being hypothetical of course, but hopefully you understand the premise).<p>A counterpoint to my argument is that this is the government, not corporation X or shady data reseller Y. I concede that there is a different feeling associated with the government spying on you (with the assumption of legality), and some third-party actor who maybe, some day, could be brought to trial (we hope?).<p>Yet the practical result is the same: there are people building profiles of us which we will never see, and judging how best to relate to us based on them. They have been doing it for a lot longer than five years, and I don't see the trend reversing any time soon. It doesn't really freak me out, either. In a way, it just makes sense.",1342605541

4260058,comment,4257498,4258683,4,0,belorn,,,"You bring some interesting points so let start with the moral standpoint. If voting with your dollar should be the method to give society feedback what is needed, roads and water should be the most expensive items one pay for. Voting with your dollar sound fine in theory, but try to find a single study proving it. There is none, and studies like ""The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism"" by Economist George Akerlof, and those produced by Amartya Sen should shine some light on why.<p>Copying is as simple as needing, that is the amount of energy and action needed to copy something, is about the same as just simply needing something. Like star trek replicators, you ask for something, and a perfect copy materialize. If I was hungry and I asked the replicator for a piece of bread, would I be depriving the baker of salary?\nSo the question ends up, how should the baker be payed for the first loaf of bread. A dollar for each copy made from it? When the poor is then denied said bread and dies because he does not have that dollar for a copy, is that then murder or good for society?<p>So how do we make it valuable to develop. My answer would be:<p>- Society should pay for infrastructure, be that roads, water, or network infrastructure. (Tax)<p>- Industry regulations should regulate the industry, not private people. If a company want to do earn profit by using software made by others, they should pay. (CC-BY-NC)<p>- Concepts like media tax would work quite fine, if distributed ""To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts"". The current media tax seen at places like Canada and Sweden are twisted forms of that where the collectors take the largest share, and then popularity in radio takes the rest. (Media tax).<p>- Products do compete against free and sometimes wins. Look at the ""$9.99"" bin at the supermarket. When the product is offered as convenience, it does not matter if at the back, down the stairs, through the window, next to the gutter, there is a ""free all-you-can-eat buffet"" of pirated goods. This goes back to Industry regulations. Regulate people who are running for-profit operations and that is enough to create value for the producer. (lets call that economics)",1342604539

For example: I'm a transport planner specialising in Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) systems[1]. 5 years ago, a certain large corporation took a very serious interest in building a campus-wide PRT system, funding extensive feasibility and engineering studies to that effect. The primary rationale for the system was value of time. When these high-value employees spend a significant amount of time hunting for places to park or moving around the campus on its internal shuttlebus system, that represents a substantial loss of value-creation. Thus a $360 million PRT system which saved each employee an average of five minutes per day would pay for itself in just a few years. The business case had other legs to stand on as well, but that was by far the most impressive item on the balance sheet.<p>Unfortunately, before the scheme could come to fruition, there followed a series of unfortunate events -- including but by no means limited to the collapse of the world economy -- which convinced said corporation that an even more appealing way to optimise their employees' value creation was to cancel all capital expenditures and sack a few thousand people.

Think about other things people lose on a regular basis. For example, why not make this thing key-chain friendly? Should be pretty easy to do by adding a hole on the device.<p>Also, I would recommend removing the ""TrackR"" text from the device. Otherwise, it will be the first thing a thief gets rid of once they have your wallet. On the other hand, if you try to make it look as inconspicuous as possible, it is less likely to attract unwanted attention.<p>Another crazy idea: offer an option to have it <i>sewn into</i> the wallet so that it A) is hidden and B) cannot slide off by accident.",1352753946

4774694,comment,4773897,4774329,4,0,niels_olson,,,"As a Cr-48 owner, the thought of buying another one crossed my mind yesterday. I like the hardware affordances so much I replicated them on the high end with Apple products. My daughter uses my Cr-48 now. It almost broke yesterday. During the diagnostic process, I considered just buying another one.<p>You see, I really liked running Ubuntu on my Cr-48. It pretty well convinced me to get the 4G iPad, just so I could have mobile data on my macbook. So I now carry a 4g iPad and 15"" rMBP and gave the Cr-48 to my daughter.<p>Yesterday, my son dislocated (subluxed?) the Cr-48's screen hinge. Apparently the hinge mounting screws inside the case had worked themselves a bit loose and his action hyperextended the joint so far the plastic pieces of hinge interfered with each other so it wouldn't close. And the hinge was obviously loose. My daughter was hysterical until I took it apart (took about 2 minutes from incident to repair). During those two minutes, I seriously thought about getting another one. Because she loves it sooo much.<p>So, at least in terms of cheap, energy-efficient, light, mobile laptop, I think there's a market. ChromeOS, I don't know. I'm in the military, so a network-dependent OS is a non-starter for me.<p>For Christmas, I'm not sure I'm getting the kids any electronics. I'm tempted to get them iPad minis but I don't see them using tablets for anything productive, so an ultrabook makes more sense. But I see no reason to a) buy a laptop for a 7- and 10 year old kids, or b) buy a Chromebook, even at the price, if I'm only going to convert it to Ubuntu. In part because switching the BiOS is one headache more than I care to endure. In part because imposing an unsupported operating system on someone else just seems rude.<p>In the case of the Asus C7: no way am I buying any more spinning rust hard drives.",1352753273

As you can imagine, I am a huge fan of ""old school"" knobs and push-buttons in vehicles precisely for that reason, and the recent trends towards touch-everything drive me crazy.<p>Back on point towards your comment, maybe ""touch"" timing wouldn't work. But phones have something in-dash systems don't expose to the end-user: accelerometer.

Costs go up but behavior doesn't change, so an increase in energy costs just replaces spending on other goods, hurting the rest of the economy.<p>Over the longer run, though, if prices have risen significantly and permanently, and that coincides with a point where a consumer decides they need to replace their car, then oil consumption does start becoming more elastic: the consumer is more likely to choose the more fuel efficient vehicle. We've seen some of this in the rise in sales of small vehicles versus trucks and SUVs lately.<p>This is where building a long-term steady upward price trend is important, versus short-term price shocks, since the former allows the economy to react appropriately by increasing efficiency.",1352753134

It's less imprecise than no comment at all. Suppose you have a very simple function that does something clear - reading the code you can tell what it does and how. And suppose that function is called from several hundred different contexts in the codebase, but one of those contexts causes an exception in your simple function.<p>You could ""fix"" it, with a code change. But what if your fix goes against the assumptions of some other context where the same function is called? A comment that describes what the function ""should"" do allows you to decide whether changing the function, or its caller, will be more in line with the design of the overall codebase. This is particularly true with mature codebases where thousands of tiny fixes and tweaks have accumulated over time. There's a corpus of learning about why the code ended up that way that even in-depth reading of individual functions might miss.<p>Tests are good, and to be encouraged. But using tests in place of comments is rather like answering a question with a question. Tests provide confidence, they do not provide understanding.<p>Of course, you could do an in-depth analysis of every function, in every context it's used, and how it interacts with its callers and callees. While you're doing that, the guys who commented their code will be moving onto the next challenge.",1352753115

The US has to move cargo over large distances and buys much of it's products from producers over seas. It's completely dependent on oil from that perspective. The size of the country also hurts development of things like high speed rail and public transportation due to issues with urban sprawl unlike it's european and asian counterparts where these projects have done well. There's a land mass nearly the size of Russia with very sparsely populated areas strewn about and tons of existing infrastructure in the way. Then there are also cities that are in some cases the size of small European countries with a population that's less dense. The logistics of these make solving the cargo and transportation issues very difficult. In the mean time, the US can't sit idle and just let things collapse unless it wants risk civil unrest. Combine all this with military and economic threats from China, Russia, and the middle east and it's no surprise to me that the government wants to ensure the US can continue to play a major role in oil production. Keep in mind that oil is a commodity, so it's not about the money. This is purely about the future of the country.<p>Regarding my comment about cars, see the reply above to someone who made a similar point. There's evidence that progress is being made. It's just developing in niche markets where innovation typically happens (consumer cars, race cars, small power companies, etc..). I wasn't trying to say that CSX would start moving cargo via tesla cars. Please tell me you didn't really believe that.<p>I'm not convinced the issue is one of a lack of demand. It's just a really difficult problem to solve and when the well being of the country is at state, the politicians aren't going to willing throw it's economy into a depression or risk one of it's enemies forcing it's hand. Hope is not a strategy.<p>Finally, no sane country is going to willing limit it's oil usage. That's especially true for a country that's been in a recession for over 4 years and every good and service is impacted by the cost of oil.",1352752853

Hurley's judgment reflected accepted policy at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona. ""[P]urchasing multiple long guns in Arizona is lawful,"" Patrick Cunningham, the U.S. Attorney's thencriminal chief in Arizona would later write. ""Transferring them to another is lawful and even sale or barter of the guns to another is lawful unless the United States can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the firearm is intended to be used to commit a crime."" (Arizona federal prosecutors referred requests for comment to the Justice Department, which declined to make officials available. Hurley noted in an e-mail, ""I am not able to comment on what I understand to be an ongoing investigation/prosecution. I am precluded by federal regulation, DOJ policy, the rules of professional conduct, and court order from talking with you about this matter."" Cunningham's attorney also declined to comment.)<p>It was nearly impossible in Arizona to bring a case against a straw purchaser. The federal prosecutors there did not consider the purchase of a huge volume of guns, or their handoff to a third party,  sufficient evidence to seize them. A buyer who certified that the guns were for himself, then handed them off minutes later, hadn't necessarily lied and was free to change his mind. Even if a suspect bought 10 guns that were recovered days later at a Mexican crime scene, this didn't mean the initial purchase had been illegal. To these prosecutors, the pattern proved little. Instead, agents needed to link specific evidence of intent to commit a crime to each gun they wanted to seize.</i><p>Yep, sounds like this is all the fault of some renegade ATF agent.  Nothing to do with the laws in place, no sir.",1352752608

I have written about this here on HN before (too many times), but I think it is worth noting. My experience with my Chromebook runs like this.<p>I bought it because I thought I could use it to ssh (via the underlying terminal in developer mode) into my linode and work on the train each day to and from work. I bought the 3G Chromebook for this reason. When I got it I was very impressed. The build quality is really excellent, it is a piece of really well built commodity hardware. Plastic but excellent, hinge weight and great keyboard. The 3G was unworkable and I had to give up my mobile plans on day one (not the Chromebooks fault - I live in York and commute to Leeds, with bad 3G coverage).<p>So the next stage my Chromebook stays at home and overnight becomes the internet computer for the whole house. We watch TV on it, we do searches on it. It is fast, it is light and for surfing the internet it is just this always on service. Very good :)<p>During this time I played around with installing another OS on the Chromebook. But it was always difficult and I never dedicated the time to gritting through it. However, when the new Chromebooks came out I got all exited again and started looking into it again. In the mean time someone has set up a very easy to use install, with instructions, Ubuntu onto your Chromebook. I did this. Now I program every day on the train to and from work and I enjoy my Chromebook more than any computer I have owned before.<p>A caveat, I use my Ubuntu-ised Chromebook to hack Go code in vim. I am just using terminals and a browser. So if you want more than that from a laptop you may not enjoy it as much as I have.<p>This is just for hackers though. Does not explain why the new ones are so popular with the general public. But my wife is not in IT and she loves it (even with Ubuntu on it :)",1352751983

A few thoughts:<p>- Python.org is quite a simple web app, it would be interesting to run this against something a little more complex like a long wikipedia article or <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/</a> or even the Alexa Top 500<p>- It would also be interesting to split the times between parsing and selecting as I feel that's where the difference between pq and lxml comes in.<p>All in all it seems BS4 is quite a bit faster than I gave it credit for (especially factoring in parsing+selecting instead of just the former)",1352750583

Cargo is, and that's why I brought it up, your original argument only mentions cars specifically and everyone driving hybrid is going to make little impact and as things currently stand everyone driving fully electric won't do squat. I think we are beating the same drum though.<p>The map of country size comparison... should the land mass off a country determine your ""allowed usage"" or should be be proportional to population? Since the higher your population the more energy needs you have... I'm sure there is some complex set of graphs related to this somewhere...<p>The sarc comment is for your extremely generalized comment, it's very much an American view on the ""rest of world"" and makes you sound very ignorant. I fully agree with your US influence comment though, and not just within that region, but that's a whole other story...<p>What the US needs to do is reduce it dependence on oil so that it becomes less difficult to hurt it's economy. Oil will run out at some point (aside from the irreparable harm that is being down to the environment) and at the moment all they are doing is shifting the problem on to the next generation.",1352750567

I have almost been sideswiped a stupid amount of times because someone is holding the phone/hand/arm up on the left side and decides to change lanes without looking, while talking and with body position blocking vision. It makes me angry that mine and others lives are less important than delaying their conversation.",1352750559

Encryption does not necessarily involve ensuring data source authenticity.<p>If you have an SHA hash as part of the request url and you can trust the SHA hash calculator to verify the authenticity of the final file then you can trust the whole encryption layer to return whatever data it wants because hash verify will refuse tampered servers.<p>The trick is to ensure the hash calculator is 100% untampered. For the more paranoid people this means using command line hash calculator for this just as it's used for linux distro .iso files etc.",1352750543

4774454,comment,4772067,4772430,2,0,lubujackson,,,"I think the biggest impact of real names on Quora is their impact on quality and personal branding.  People post on Quora a lot more for vanity/business promotion than they do on Reddit.  So from that standpoint, Reddit is much richer in what people will say but also a lot noisier.  What it implies to me is that Quora has a much lower ceiling for engagement, especially since everything is public (unlike Google+ or Facebook) so people are especially careful about what they say there.  In other words, Quora simply can't take over the world because the vast majority of people don't want to have their thoughts so publicly available.",1352750448

Who is going to have it, and not spend it? I&#x27;d venture to say the percent of people flushing their basic income down the toilet is in the low single digits at best.<p>It&#x27;s a virtuous cycle, and no force should be needed to keep it going. Think about it: who in their right mind would move to another currency that wiped out their entire existing and future wealth? As another commenter pointed out, $11K a year is like having $500K in wealth paying out an annuity. Who would voluntarily give that up for some alternate currency that makes them poor?<p>Even today, look at how hard it is to modify a social welfare scheme. It&#x27;s not because the government has guns and the desire to use them, it&#x27;s because people really, really rely on social stability.<p>But yes, you&#x27;re right of course: like all fiat money schemes, it only works because people want it to work.

C can be embedded in Go easily, and even if it couldn&#x27;t, there&#x27;s no reason that one has to &quot;win out&quot; over the other. There&#x27;s less direct competition between two languages than there is with a family of OSes. And Go was never intended to replace C completely - it just provides a better alternative for some subset of what C/C++/Java are used for. On the other hand, any given system is going to run only one OS[0].<p>In any case, as I mentioned, it&#x27;s a tradeoff. There&#x27;s no absolute answer, though I think he&#x27;s right here in that the benefits don&#x27;t outweigh the costs for this example.<p>Put another way, much as I might like to run a microkernel, I&#x27;d have a hard time concluding that it&#x27;d be the right move for the Linux project to spend time refactoring the entire codebase into a microkernel!<p>On the other hand, to see an example of a rewrite that was successful, look at Reddit, which rewrote the entire codebase in its early days.

Research Unix V8, V9, and V10 got virtually no uptake, despite being incremental evolutions of the original upstream, due to a mixture of inertia and licensing restrictions from AT&T. Instead, different incremental evolutions of V7, developed by other developers outside Bell Labs, became the dominant strains of Unix.<p>Plan9 was a pretty significant departure from Research Unix V7, but not <i>as</i> significant a change compared to V10... which didn&#x27;t matter because nobody outside Bell Labs was using V8/9/10 anyway, since everyone was working on various forks of V7 (BSD, SunOS/Solaris, Xenix, etc.).",1393195692

With every project, there&#x27;s a tradeoff between achieving the goals of the project and maintaining compatibility with existing systems.<p>As a Go programmer, I feel a bit sad/ashamed to be saying this, but look at Plan 9 - it failed to usurp Unix (and its descendants) as the dominant OS, because the latter was &quot;good enough&quot;, and was already more widely supported and used.<p>Plan 9 vs. Unix is a very different comparison than Vim vs. Neovim, and there are a lot of other factors at play, but the same principle actually holds. Improving or extending an existing system in a compatible way is a lot easier than trying to establish mindshare with a completely new tool.<p>The tradeoff is that extending existing systems leads to cruft and bloat. So <i>if</i> you can establish mindshare with a new tool, you have an opportunity to make a much more elegant one. But that&#x27;s a big &quot;if&quot;.<p><i>EDIT</i>: I think a better analogy may be an attempt to refactor the Linux kernel into a microkernel.

The 3.75 trillion for basic income would be split evenly among the 330 million people, amounting to $11,364 annually per person. Each person would also have $11,364 to allocate (&quot;appropriate&quot;) for various social causes.<p>Taxation is eliminated. Everyone is fed and sheltered. Growth in wealth is shared equally. Anarchists still get to keep all of the money they earn (remember: no taxation). IRS is gone. All of the tax-funded welfare programs are gone, but we&#x27;ve got plenty of money annually to dedicate to social welfare programs. People don&#x27;t have to give money to the police if they care more about education. There&#x27;s no need for a minimum wage, or tracking people&#x27;s incomes. There&#x27;s no downside (in terms of extra taxation and lost benefits) to working more. And on and on.<p>This is entirely doable today, at a purely technical/administrative level. Once robots are doing the work of the labor class, and 40% of the country <i>literally</i> has no jobs, and won&#x27;t, everâ€”then it&#x27;ll become a social necessity.<p>That&#x27;s why the problems in this article don&#x27;t keep me up at night: not only is the solution easy, it&#x27;s far preferable and <i>way</i> more democratic and fair than what we have today.<p>For extra humanity, create a global currency, peg new money creation to the world&#x27;s annual GDP, and do a basic and social income for everyone in the world equally, full stop.",1393194153

If the attacker can crack one or two weak passwords, they can start limiting their search space immediately, and crack more passwords. As they gain more examples to work with, they will be able to work out how your salt is derived, and then they can start looking for salt collisions based only on the data that is stored in the clear.<p>At that point, your attacker has not only the ability to derive the salt and attack each password individually, but potentially the ability to generate rainbow tables for subsets of users with identical (or largely identical) derived salts.<p>The point is that at best, you&#x27;re <i>adding</i> a term to the overall hardness of the attack. When you use something like bcrypt, you are <i>multiplying</i> the hardness of the attack. There is no comparison between what you&#x27;ve proposed with MD5 or SHA-1 and simply using bcrypt on a random salt, even if the latter has your source code in the latter but not the former.",1393193409

In very basic terms, the HHI is a way to measure the concentration of a given market.

The size of the communal unit has varied across times and places in history, from clans to tribes to city-states to nations. And hybrid systems where individuals (or more often, households) are responsible for some things and a larger communal unit is responsible for others have also been common. But the individual standing alone, providing for his or her needs entirely independently of any communal system except for market purchases, seems to only exist in certain philosophers&#x27; systems, not as something you really observe historically as the natural state of <i>homo sapiens</i> societies.",1393193392

What is this, 1996?<p>Each individual Comcast customer has in theory paid for a DS3 worth of bandwidth (modulo the &quot;cap&quot;), which should be a reality-check that some of your assumptions from that era need updating.<p>The defense (and it was always a thin one) of ratio clauses in peering agreements was hot potato routing.  The ingress traffic is what you actually have to haul a long distance, so the agreement says &quot;you must meet us everywhere we peer, and you must maintain ratio.&quot;  Together, those rules mean each individual path will be asymmetric but the overall load on the WAN will be shared between the peers.  It was always slightly silly, though.<p>Hot potato is now over.  CDN&#x27;s are desperate to do all the work and bring traffic as close to eyeballs as the monopolists will allow because the cost of actually building a network is irrelevant compared to the rent the monopolists are extracting.  The monopolists are selling so-called &quot;transit&quot; to haul packets 1 mile.  They&#x27;re really charging for access to their captive eyeballs, not for moving bits.  If you want to send a few megabits to Asia, fine, whatever.  You can do it for the same price.  They&#x27;re not even mad, &quot;glad we could make a deal,&quot; etc.  The situation is nakedly broken and warped, and everybody actually in the business knows it.<p>Peering has always been a mix of market power, shaming, and political excuses (&quot;ratio&quot; was one).  What we&#x27;re now seeing is the shaming and excuses fall away thanks to apologist bloggers and weak politicians, and market power emerge as the only thing that matters.  Compared to this power, traditional outdated notions of neutrality are irrelevant: there is no need to give traffic less &quot;preferential&quot; treatment when you can simply depeer them and then try to sell them so-called &quot;transit&quot; to go 1 mile.  &quot;Paid peering&quot; == &quot;well, how much money you got?

Searching for ""a holy grail"" (a cancer cure), I came up with this theory that explains how these compounds work against cancer:<p>Quercetin is an antioxidant. It neutralizes free radicals. While doing so this quercetin changes to a radical molecule. For example it neutralizes 4 radical molecules and becomes a radical molecule with 4 radicals.\nThen it sticks to DNA (covalent binding). Because there is no water present there, it stays a radical molecule.\nWhen a cell divides, water nears this molecule so it reacts with water causing OH radicals killing the cell.\nNormal cells always repair their entire DNA before cell division, so the radical flavonoid molecule is removed. So normal cells stay unharmed.\nCancer cells divide before they have repaired their entire DNA, so they die.\nSo it's actually a bomb.\nA flavonoid molecule is like a bomb that explodes if it's not removed before a cell tries to divide. Cancer cells that divide before reperation die, because the bomb isn't removed, so it explodes when the cell tries to divide. Normal cells that divide after reperation remove the bomb so they live.\nCancer cells that do completely repair their DNA before cell division aren't cancer cells anymore (they are normal cells) because they have to wait a long time before cell division.\nNormal cells that did not completely repair their DNA before cell division can pass a mutation down to daughter cells.\nSo flavonoids kill only cancer cells but no normal cells.\nIt's like this:\nNormal cell -> completely repaired -> flavonoid bomb removed -> cell divides normal\nCancer cell -> not completely repaired -> flavonoid bomb detonates -> cell killed while it was dividing.\nCancer cell that completely repairs = normal cell.<p>http://www.acancer.info/",1365173997

5498795,comment,5497253,5497706,12,0,rdl,,,"Essentially no one does ""EPO drills"" on their datacenters.  Particularly in multi-tenant environments like commercial colocation centers.  It's quite reasonable for your DR plan to involve a $200k+ cost per EPO pull or DR failover.  Your business should have DR provisions, and you should test the DR plan, but it's probably not reasonable (or legal) to do a full test involving dumping agent, rapid power off, etc.<p>The fire suppression exists for two reasons.  One, is to get code exemptions to be allowed to run wiring in ways which would otherwise require licensed electricians to do every wiring job, and prohibit people from being in the facility.  Two is to detect small fires early, and to prevent their spread, as well as to protect facilities from catastrophic facility-wide fire.<p>Servers are just not that high a fire risk, particularly when de-energized.  Generally inside a self-contained metal chassis, less than 100 pounds each, metal/plastic, etc.  The power supply is the most likely component to start a fire, and contains a max of maybe 250g of capacitors and other components.  The risk of one server catching on fire is low, and the risk of it rapidly spreading to anything else is low, so yes, I'd be comfortable pulling a single burning server out of a de-energized rack.<p>Also, in big or purpose-built facilities, those components <i>most</i> likely to be fire risks (batteries/power handlers, and generators) are in separate rooms, separated by firewalls from the datacenter.  A fire in the <i>battery room</i> is going to be dealt with by sealing that room and powering it off, dumping suppression agent, and bringing out the FD immediately.<p>Life safety is much more important than business continuity, but a lot of people have jobs where they accept a non-zero risk of physical harm to do their jobs.  It's certainly not reasonable to demand a datacenter tech go into a burning building to rescue a database server or something, but approximately zero datacenter staff I know would have a problem with assuming the level of risk I would to find problems.  (it's probably a bigger deal for employers to actually discourage risk-taking by employees, particularly when it's risk-taking to save themselves effort, like single-person racking large UPSes or very large servers, etc.)",1365173974

5498790,comment,5497341,5498534,3,0,pdwetz,,,"I agree with a lot of your points; ego is a dangerous thing. However, I think it's important to differentiate between the two major types of rewrites (or claims as to why something should be rewritten): 1) The code is obviously subpar vs. 2) the programmer doesn't understand the code.<p>I've had to deal with code written by 3rd parties where I doubted the person was actually a programmer who wrote it; nonsensical or nonexistent naming conventions, large methods of dubious logic that were often never actually called (anymore?), and a general avoidance of best practices (and I don't mean advanced code; even simple things like code comments along the lines of ""this is a for loop"").<p>#2 is a different beast altogether and I think this more applies to your last paragraph. Is the source code too advanced for the programmer reading it, or is the code/architecture too obtuse? Unfortunately, I think it's often primarily programmer laziness more so than the design itself. I've been told by devs they don't understand a system and when asked what they don't understand, they simply shrug their shoulders. If you don't make an attempt to ""get"" the current system, in no way should you be allowed to rewrite it from scratch. You need to at least learn the mistakes of the current system.",1365173909

5498783,comment,5497851,5498405,1,0,dhstylez,,,"There was a time in high school where I came to the realization that I learned material better doing independent study than in actual lectures/classes. Reading/studying on my own allowed me to learn in a more focused atmosphere. Lectures seemed like a waste, time spent scribing what was being 'taught' (for review later) versus actually absorbing material. Also, I felt that a lot of my time was wasted on topics that I really didn't care for and was quite painful (American & European History come to mind).<p>I brought this up to my guidance counselor and asked why I was wasting my time in high school when I could just as easily buy a book. Half-considered dropping out of high school and focusing my studies on topics that were interesting (physics, chemistry, cs, math, and possibly finance).<p>Our dialogue went something like:<p>GC: Uhh...don't drop out. You should stay in school it's good for you<p>Me: But I learn better straight from the book, it's what I'm doing for my courses now anyway...<p>GC: You need to have teachers<p>Me: Why?<p>GC: It's hard to get into [a reputable?] college without graduating from high school.<p>Me: ...<p>Kind of wish I did drop out back then. I would have probably spent a lot of my time honing a particular craft, although CS and Finance/Accounting seem to be the easiest choices (lower cost of entry compared to chemistry/physics/biology - requiring labs).<p>tl/dr: I wanted to drop out of high school and study independently.

After a lot of introspection and discussion with friends, I realized that weed was making my situation worse. It had turned from an escape to a nightmare. It was like a light bulb turned on and I could see everything clearly. For example, I would get really bad headaches and start feeling nauseous around the time I would usually smoke on weekdays (5 PM). If I was in a meeting, I would usually become very moody and frequently had to leave. I never realized it was from the weed, though. I always wrote it off at every occurrence as a virus or a bad meal or just lack of sleep.<p>The day came when I decided to quit. I will give a brief outline of what it was like and how it felt.<p>Day 1: Felt really good and positive about the whole situation. I had cravings at night but was able to ignore them.<p>Day 2: Started to have a hard time eating. I also felt a bit more stressed.<p>Day 3: Woke up with my bed completely soaked from night sweats. I was so dehydrated I gagged all morning and then had to go to work. My moods would go from happy to nearly suicidal all day. I couldn't stomach any solid food and sweated all day.<p>Day 4-5: Waked up both days with my sheets soaked in sweat. Extremely vivid and stressful dreams. Couldn't go to work. Constant panic attacks. Suicidal thoughts. Even liquids besides water or soda were hard to ingest.<p>Day 6: Night sweats weren't as bad. I could start stomaching shakes and some sugary solid foods. My moods started to even out a bit and I didn't get the intense lows like the previous days.<p>Day 7: Night sweats not soaking the sheets anymore. Some food becoming more palatable. Headaches hit me around 5 PM.<p>Day 8-14: Was able to start going back to work. I had to have a lot of shakes to stay fed. The feeling of sobriety starts to hit and everything seems much more clear and lucid. I feel as if I took a drug that gave me hyper focus and mental awareness. I realized that even when not high, my mind was still very hazy and mentally affected while smoking heavily. I was essentially ""always stoned"". Getting rid of that haze was like opening curtains in a dark room.<p>That was about a year ago. I relapsed and am currently going through the withdrawal process as I type this. I have been up all night because my sweats soaked my bed and I don't want to fall back asleep just to wake up in sweat again. This line from the story really hit home this morning:<p><pre><code>     Sherman had battled clinical depression, and his mind may have been clouded by marijuana, which he often smoked to self-medicate.\n</code></pre>\nNow, I want to make it clear that I am not trying to claim this is the reason Jody did what he did. I simply feel that it is a VERY important discussion. This comment below made me very angry/concerned, enough to create an anon account and post this novel.<p><pre><code>     Stopped reading at the speculation that marijuana may have contributed to his suicide. The fuck???\n</code></pre>\nIf you claim marijuana withdrawals don't exist, you are ignorant. Talk to people who have used the drug as a life escape and then quit. Most drugs are worse than marijuana but we can't downplay its faults.

They get less and less sensitive over time, building up your tolerance to marijuana. Your cannabinoid receptors are what are used to tell your brain you are hungry. When they don't respond to normal body signals and only marijuana consumption, then you are at a state where eating is only possible while high.",1365172209

5498591,comment,5497851,5497851,35,0,rmk2,,,"This is the perfect article to be submitted to HN. Because it brings out the worst in HN. The saturated, self-congratulatory, better-than-thou crowd that is smug about their income, prospects and <i>worth</i>. Many here already believe that everything that isn't programming or engineering is virtually worthless and should be killed. This reinforces them.<p>But credit where credit is due: Academia, especially in the humanities, is everything but cosy. There is little money in it, there are few available positions.<p>However, being a slight bit along the same way as the author, I can only relay what I see around me every day. From the group of PhD students around me, how many hold any illusions as to what academia means? None that I have met. Out of a group of ~10 people, some almost finished, some at the beginning (this is not in the US, so everyone has done a masters or equivalent before), nobody wants to become a professor. One wants to become (and judging by how she's doing, she will be) a curator, I see people interested in broadcasting, teaching (as in: school), publishing and politics. It might be different in the US, I do not know. But here, it is painfully obvious to everyone I meet as to what the chances are to land a faculty position.<p>Do <i>I</i> care? To a degree (no pun intended). Would I like to go into academia? Yes. Do I know what that means? Yes. I write quickly, I enjoy a wide range of topics, I don't mind giving talks etc. I am flexible. Would I have to move if I wanted to go down that route? Yes. Does that bother me? No, it really doesn't. I will give it its fair shot, I will finish the PhD, and I will have a look around for post-doc positions. If it doesn't work? Fair enough, publishing or IT  or something else it is.<p>I am not terribly bothered about money, not because I am somehow well off, but because I do not particularly care. I don't need that much to be happy. As long as I will be able to buy books and music here and there, go out every now and then and have a somewhat nice flat somewhere, I will be fine. I would like to be able to have dog, though.<p>I don't understand the vitriol on HN, I really don't. Everytime the humanities come up, there are the same type of comments, comparing software development entry salaries to professors, talking about student debt etc. Many here seem to be <i>incapable</i> (or unwilling) to even acknowledge that their own set of values is <i>not universal</i>, that not everybody wants to make it or even cares about making it.<p>In many ways, I qualify for things here, I dabble in programming, I use LaTeX/Emacs/org-mode for all my work, I use Linux permanently, write my own shell-scripts, report bugs etc. That does not mean I would necessarily like to be a programmer. HN is obsessed with making money and in doing so forgets that not everyone shares the same worldview.<p>I'm sure I will be fine. I do not have any student debt, I will start doing whatever it is I will be doing with a clean slate, I owe no money and I see my experiences as everything but lost time. I love what I am doing, and It would be a pity to give it up. If I have to, I will, but until then, I'll see where it'll take me.<p>P.S.: I'm doing German now (though I have done other European languages before). Just like the original author. Her choice of topic probably didn't help her overall feelings about her position, either. Kafka is one of those authors about whom so much has been done that it is hard to approach him without a huge amount of preconceptions.<p>e: syntax",1365171920

We don't know enough about Martian soils to be sure that we can grow crops there.<p>>Mars will be analogous to North America in the 16-20th centuries.<p>I see this analogy around a lot and I've never cared for it.<p>1) All successful settlements of Europeans in the new world had some economic purpose for existing. The first few attempts to settle North America by English settlers were dismal failures until they discovered that they could grow valuable tobacco there. What is Mars' tobacco? We'd need a product that is cheaper to manufacture on Mars and ship back to Earth than to make on Earth. We need this because...<p>2) Mars is a vastly more hostile environment than the new world. It would have been possible to set up fairly small colonisation groups that were <i>mostly</i> if not entirely self-sufficient and thus didn't need to find economically sustainable products to sell to the home country in trade for vital supplies. In fact, later settlement in New England followed this pattern - many people paid for their passage and bought some land and only needed a few imported goods rather than the whole-sale re-supply that the earlier settlers in Virginia had required.<p>The minimum local knowledge and technology base was essentially simple agriculture at first, followed by some village-level craftsmen for simple tools and such. This meant that only a small fraction of the local economy had to produce goods for export because most things could be produced locally.<p>That is very far from being the case on Mars. The minimum technology base required to have a mostly independent colony on Mars is a substantial fraction of our entire tech base on earth. Even if we assume that high-complexity, high value-density things like computers and other electronics are imported from Earth that still leaves us with a lot that needs to be made on Mars. If we want to build another settlement on Mars from our initial base, can we do that?<p>Can we build the environmental management equipment needed? Pressure envelopes, power generation and distribution? Even something like light bulbs would be hard to do. Individually, all of these things are totally possible of but when you add them all together you start to require an awful lot of machinery to take with you.<p>The alternative of course is to keep supplying these things from Earth but without a sustainable source of goods to export back to Earth that isn't going to be sustainable.<p>3) The relative cost of transportation. Early settlers of the new world could use existing ships once they knew where to go. With Mars we know where to go but we don't have the ships. A moderately wealthy merchant could pay for the passage of his whole extended family to the Americas, even if the price drops dramatically that isn't going to be the case with a passage to Mars.<p>None of this is to say that I don't want to see permanent human settlement on other planets, but I think that comparing it to the settlement of the Americas is very unhelpful.",1365171593

Aspiring to be some sort of god among programmers won't actually make you great, it will just make you arrogant and unable to see your own failings and ignorance, which will always be vast compared to your skills and knowledge.<p>On the other side, it isn't fluffy snowflake talk to say that every human being has his or her areas of strength and exceptional insight. Helping less experienced programmers on a team learn and grow, and figuring out how they can contribute productively without causing problems is likely worth a much bigger bonus than one guru who thinks his shit doesn't stink and talks down to everyone else. According to Zen, the beginner's state of mind is ideal because it is free of preconceptions. Someone who believes the ideas of a novice are beneath him will be blind to a lot of wisdom.<p>As a last aside, <i>every</i> team I've ever worked on that inherits code thinks the code is shit and rewrites it. Then when some other team inherits the rewritten code, they proclaim it shit and rewrite it again. Some percentage of this is due to bad code. Some is because all complex applications which are developed in a hurry in shifting business environments end up pretty hairy. And the rest is because almost all complicated code looks like shit when it's unfamiliar, even if it's fairly well engineered. So you'll throw it out and run into all the same issues on your rewrite and your code will end up just as opaque, but you'll understand it now so you'll think it's brilliant, and then you'll write self-congratulatory blog posts about how great you are and how terrible everyone else is, blissfully oblivious that in 3 months, a new developer will take on the project and rewrite it and write the same exact blog post out of imperious disgust for your work.",1365171421

North Korea is of interest because the nation-state appears to be capable of complex engineering and manufacturing (if nothing else, nuclear capabilities are a good milestone), to the point of being worth international concern. By contrast, I'm sure there are some effectively isolated island or African nation-states that cannot achieve the same level of significance.<p>So for an isolationist nation-state to be able of complex sophistication, one requirement does seem to be that the people are relatively imprisoned, either through force or indoctrination, or a combination. This facilitates some type of energy/GDP transfer from the people to the central direction of the nation-state.<p>However, that alone is not enough - it does not mean that the surface area of the population and/or natural resources are rich enough. A total slave society in a desert won't produce as much complexity (Egypt comes to mind, but they had the Nile, hence the exception).<p>So some combination of (Forced Central Direction) + (Minimum Natural Resources) + (Minimum Population or Productivity) must be the formula to break out of total and immediate failure, and to get on a technology development track. I would imagine another  ingredient is external state support in N.Korea's case, but I'd like to leave that to the side at first. Maybe it turns out that's the only way an isolated nation-state can get on an advanced technology track.<p>Any thoughts?",1365170443

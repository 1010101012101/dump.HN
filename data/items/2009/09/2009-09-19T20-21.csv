It's suffering from second system effect in pretty terrifying ways.  Of course, we then jumped ship to Joomla, which has a nice core but the modules are of wildly varying quality, and so ended up regretting the move, as its problems were even more pronounced and harder to fix than OpenACS.  We finally settled on Drupal earlier this year, and have been mostly happy with it.<p>That it was written in Tcl was actually not among my many complaints about OpenACS (though there are languages I prefer, Tcl is acceptably sane and acceptably powerful).",1253393191

Sites like Facebook with their 'walled garden' photos are missing out on a great opportunity. I'm glad to hear about DailyBooth as it's a YCombinator participant. We're applying to participate in their next session. 
One way they can start monetizing now is by partnering with our company, PicWash.com. They can add a link on their toolbar for users to get their photo retouched by our  professional graphic designers. It's a revenue share model that can help get a new stream of revenue on their books. There are lots of other more traditional revenue models that can be done as well (advertising, freemium, etc).",1253391976

For people trying to run the existing webgl samples (using something like utils3d.js) that are out there with the nightly ff build:<p><pre><code>  1) canvasElement.getContext(""moz-webgl""), not ""webkitwhatever""
</code></pre>
(Conflicts w/presentation slides pdf on the khronos site, which says ""3D"" with a capital D)<p><pre><code>  2) context.clearDepth(...) -> .clearDepthf(...)
  3) CanvasFloatArray        -> WebGLFloatArray
</code></pre>
That's how far I've gotten so far.
Much more perplexing to me is a case where their code seems (I want to stress, <i>seems!</i>; maybe it's staring me in the face and I just don't get how they changed it) to break an opengl function: glBindBuffer. <a href=""http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glBindBuffer.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glBindBuffer.xml</a><p>The specs say, call glBindBuffer with (arg, arg2), and arg2 will be an unsigned int which refers to a buffer.<p>The reference above says, calling it with an arg2 of 0 and it'll reset. The webkit examples use it this way. But, their implementation of the wrapped BindBuffer method doesn't like this; if you pass in 0, it gives you an error that suggests you mean null. Pass in null, and there's an uncaught exception and an error in glBufferData, telling you that, surprise, you want an Unsigned Short.<p>In their code,<p><pre><code>  NS_IMETHODIMP
  WebGLContext::BindBuffer(GLenum target, nsIWebGLBuffer *buffer)
  {
    WebGLBuffer *wbuf = static_cast<WebGLBuffer*>(buffer);
    ...
</code></pre>
The typing of the args won't let you pass in a zero, and the typing on the constructor for the cast  is what kills it if you pass in a javascript null (it wants an integer).<p>And if you try to instantiate a WebGLBuffer instance with javascript -- whose constructor <i>expects</i> an int -- it won't let you.<p><pre><code>  nbuf = new WebGLBuffer(0);
  -> [Exception... ""Cannot convert WrappedNative to function""...
</code></pre>
You could try calling glGet... on the buffer early on, caching the default value it returns to you and then using that to invoke bindBuffer (just to be sure you're not calling it with something it shouldn't understand) but this doesn't wrap opengl directly enough; it's just whatever you see implemented here (<a href=""http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/content/canvas/src/WebGLContextGL.cpp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/content/canvas...</a>). Some functions, like bindbuffer, are implemented. The others are named very differently, and look like this:<p><pre><code>  NS_IMETHODIMP
  WebGLContext::GetCurrentArrayBufferBinding(nsIWebGLBuffer **aCurrentArrayBufferBinding)
  {
    return NS_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED;
  }
</code></pre>
Heh. Well ... I guess I'll see if I can find an example that never needs to reset the buffer binding. :P",1253390683

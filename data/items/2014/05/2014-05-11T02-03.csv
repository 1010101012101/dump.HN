Very hard. Raph&#x27;s ideas from 2006 around direct relationships and celebrity are still very much on target today -- that&#x27;s how most successful creators seem to manage it, beyond the randomness of viral outbreaks. (I count entering/winning the IGF as a form of celebrity.)<p>Beyond that, advertising it is a spray-and-pray that will likely suck up more of your money than you&#x27;ll ever make, and net you a bunch of high-churn players who don&#x27;t give a toss about what you&#x27;ve created. Not every game has an obvious niche audience to go after, not every creator welcomes or invites celebrity, and sometimes the weirdest, most un-game-like things hit a nerve nobody was expecting.<p>My mind keeps circling back to the &#x27;people who bought x also liked..&#x27; problem, as mentioned by Greg Costikyan [1].

If someone is made to feel like they&#x27;re not special, they become instantly offended.<p>It reminds me of the research that was done a couple of decades ago now, about IQs among various ethnic groups in the US. This research was considered highly controversial and inappropriate, especially once it started showing there were in fact differences between those groups (though to the chagrin of the white supremacists, people of East Asian origin seemed to slightly outperform the Europeans). Now, to be sure, some of those involved did try to misuse these results, but the outrage went far beyond that.<p>It may seem obvious now, but these results ended up causing researchers to ask even more interesting questions. We know now that IQ is as much a measure of modernity as intelligence. It is definitely dependent on the environment of both the person taking the test, as the person writing it. People taking the same tests 100 years ago would have scored significantly lower, but it is not because they were less intelligent than we are.<p>These results also sometimes point out that some communities are in fact disadvantaged in their ability to achieve in the context of the modern world.

In addition, some decisions are a trade-off (especially for doctors); for example, getting an X-ray might increase your chances of cancer, but might also detect a very rare disease; a doctor might reasonably decide, in the patient&#x27;s best interest, that given the symptoms, the increased risk of cancer is not worth the miniscule risk of not detecting the disease. If the patient is then severely injured by the disease, should the doctor have to pay out? If the patient gets support from the government either way, then the question doesn&#x27;t need to be answered. It is likely that malpractice suits encourage doctors to minimise the risk that the patient can prove a tort, rather than to act in the best interests of the patient - it is very hard to prove that a particular X-ray contributed to cancer later in life.<p>This is also fairer to businesses, because when a certain decision is unsafe relative to other practices but has a low probability of resulting in a lawsuit, most small or medium sized business engaging in the risky practice may never actually have the bad outcome happen, purely due to luck. If the government prosecutes unsafe practices, rather than the civil courts award punitive damages when unsafe practices lead to a bad outcome, businesses are discouraged or prevented from &#x27;playing the lottery&#x27;, and the desired public policy outcome of fewer unsafe practices is more directly achieved. Likewise, businesses that play it safe by industry standards but, through bad luck, have a bad outcome are not over-punished for being unlucky (this applies especially to doctors making necessary trade-offs).",1399775380

They are even contributing to peak load more than people who watch 100x as much Netflix if they happen to not be watching much Netflix at that exact moment. There is something unique in character to that Superbowl experience that is making it fundamentally more expensive to the world than other possible uses of bandwidth, and that needs to be modeled as a cost to <i>someone</i>.<p>So, much like electricity (which is difficult to store and had to then be modeled as a real-time capacity), bandwidth needs to be priced differently during &quot;peak hours&quot;. This is obviously much more complex as peak hours is defined by some decentralized notion of &quot;what is popular right now&quot;, which is why the current approximation turns into something like &quot;if you create this weird peak demand by offering the Superbowl on your website for coordinated live viewing, you should pay for this peak load increase, not the guy whose usage is small and distributed over time&quot;.<p>Sadly, that approximate solution leads to seemingly-unfortunate consequences (hence all the arguments for net neutrality), so what we need is to really think through how to get users, as opposed to content providers, to pay for this in a content-unaware fashion. If you seriously don&#x27;t want to address this and want to insist that bandwidth should be flat-rated like this you are not going to be able to achieve net neutrality :(.<p>As for the spaghetti argument: you really really <i>should</i> be thinking about your bandwidth usage. The reason we don&#x27;t have horribly wasteful electronic devices is partly because they would cause electricity bills to go up for the people using them. If you had a washer/dryer that used a thousand times more electricity than other appliances you owned, or you had a holographic television that used a thousand times more electricity than a lightbulb does, you would start to limit how often you washed clothes and watched holovision, and this would be a <i>good</i> thing: it would lead to market incentives to create similar devices that used less electricity.<p>Effectively, someone has to pay for the increased electricity cost of the world as it transitions to holovision: either users need to pay more for their electricity bill each month or the holovision manufactures need to subsidize electricity for them. The latter is what we don&#x27;t want (we want net neutrality), so either you increase everyone&#x27;s flat rate or you bill just the users using the holovision. The former penalizes people who don&#x27;t have a holovision unit and leads to inefficient electricity usage. To bill users, either you bill people who own holovision (which is largely equivalent to what we don&#x27;t want) or you just bill by the actually-relevant metric: usage.

In 1371, 75% of the degrees from the national examination had gone to candidates from the South of China. This displeased the Emperor, who believed, with many traditionalists, that Northerners were morally more worthy -- from the area where Chinese civilization had begun. The examinations were thus suspended until 1385, but then the geographical division of those who passed did not change. At a special Palace examination in 1397, all of the 52 candidates who passed were Southerners. Borrowing from the Josef Stalin school of bureaucracy, the Emperor had two of the examiners executed. In a subsequent retesting, all the successful candidates were Northerners.<p>> By 1425 it was decided that places in the national examinations would be reserved by region, with 35% for the North, 55% for the South, and 10% for some places in the middle.<p>(sourced from <a href=""http://www.friesian.com/discrim.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.friesian.com/discrim.htm</a>)",1399773955

7727420,comment,7727327,7727327,2,0,alialkhatib,,,"I get the impression that if this wasn&#x27;t calling on a third-party API (ie if you were indexing the product listings yourself) you&#x27;d be able to give more &quot;instant&quot; results, but this is a cool take on search on Amazon (although obviously inspired by Google and other instant search features). I also imagine Amazon would blacklist you for harvesting their product listing, although since you&#x27;re still giving them referrals maybe they wouldn&#x27;t. I guess if you called it &quot;aggressive caching&quot; you might get away with it, heh.<p>While you&#x27;re re-thinking product search, why not consider higher-resolution/larger thumbnails, a few more products per &quot;page&quot;, etc...? I&#x27;m <i>not</i> advocating a Pinterest clone or anything like that, but the initial load (10 items in 2 rows) looks a little... dated and spartan.<p>As said before, cool short-term project. Would be interesting to see a few more features built into this, especially if it made your search &quot;competitive&quot; with Amazon&#x27;s implementation.",1399773834

Plus the indies that have managed to get on have consistently noted that the before & after revenue is like night and day.<p>Not soul-sucking. There are other things to complain about Valve, but 30% for their services is not one of them.",1399773800

There have long been obvious differences between north and south china, but the Yangtze isn&#x27;t the border between North and South, it&#x27;s the heart of the South. North China is divided from South China by the Huai river (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huai_He"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huai_He</a>).<p>Chinese civilization is essentially the story of intensely farming a flood plain. But China has two such plains: the Yellow River defines the north, and the Yangtze defines the south.",1399773655

If you have a difficult time modeling this, try to model electricity in a world where everyone is using renewable energy sources like wind or solar (and if you find that &quot;preposterous&quot;, hydroelectric is very common as a primary electricity source in many areas). I can see a strong argument for switching to some kind of billing based on the peak load you contributed to, but that turns into a pricing model almost as complex as Amazon Glacier ;P.",1399773615

Mostly it&#x27;s because the Chinese tend culturally to be pro education and hard working but in China were reduced to very low incomes by Mao&#x27;s communism and have since been recovering and getting back towards the kind of economy they have in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and the like.<p>GDP per capita in China is $6,800 (up from $951 in 2000) against $32k in Taiwan and $55k in Singapore so there&#x27;s a way to go. A housing crash will probably just be a blip for a while. They&#x27;d have to turn back to Mao to really muck things up.",1454295499
11009398,comment,11006174,11008924,0,0,pjbrunet,,,"If you&#x27;re going to use a grid, it&#x27;s typically a starting point, when you&#x27;re looking at a blank canvas, blank screen, blank piece of paper. And as your work takes shape, you no longer need the grid. The finished work may still have some pleasing hints of underlying structure, even though the grid has been taken away. You may want to shift things just above or just below alignment to create a little interesting tension, which you can see in Cezanne&#x27;s work. But usually the grid is completely gone by the time you&#x27;re done. Most of the time, it&#x27;s not there to &quot;rule&quot; the composition from start to finish. The grid is typically a reference point.<p>Anyway, my real complaint about grids is all the technical debt it adds, and in the case of Bootstrap it&#x27;s bad, in my opinion. And it&#x27;s totally unnecessary. If you want two columns, just work from 50%, you don&#x27;t need a complex system for that. It&#x27;s harder to make changes when there&#x27;s a cryptic grid system in place. When I see code like class=&quot;grid-12c&quot; next to class=&quot;grid-9b&quot; I&#x27;m thinking what the hell? Is that supposed to be human-readable? To me, it seems like a bad trend. If people want grids so bad, then why did we stop using tables 15 years ago? Seriously. I thought floated divs were a step in the right direction, more akin to how designers/artists work, like I can just imagine Matisse saying, &quot;Float that margin a little lower. Perfect!&quot;",1454295475

The premise is for it to be used in combination with full disk encryption (since otherwise the attacker could just remove the drive), to protect the integrity of the boot shim that prompts you for the decryption password so the attacker can&#x27;t replace it with one that gives the attacker the password. But there is necessarily an unencrypted analog connection between the human and the computer and the attacker can still capture the password that way.",1454295365

11009379,comment,11008991,11009322,0,0,myztic,,,"We know far less about nutrition than we think we do. So if you know about risks and are careful about it, as far as I am concerned, there is nothing wrong with trying out various things. Regarding meat though, a lot of it is panic.<p>The problem is that it&#x27;s very hard to conduct proper studies analysing this. &#x27;Observational studies&#x27; are useless, because if I take a randomized group of meat-eaters versus vegans, of course the latter group will be significantly more healthy. Vegans are most likely more concerned about their health in general which means less smoking, less alcohol being consumed, healthier sleep, they buy higher quality food in general, due to lack of choice when out in public they cook more themselves (they won&#x27;t stop at a fast food restaurant), et cetera ... and then there is the Placebo effect, which is very powerful and should not be under-estimated.<p>The scientific data is not as clear as one might think, and &quot;nutritionists&quot; in general are pseudo-scientists at their best since you can find a study for anything. If not with humans, then with mice, or maybe just some study with some cells. The same with internet sites by the way. And Atkins strictly speaking is not the same as the traditional Ketogenic Diet. Regarding books about nutrition for example, I happen to agree with this reviewer of &quot;The China Study&quot; (not the original one, you&#x27;ll see) <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UR35AKTEYW43/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1932100660#R3UR35AKTEYW43"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UR35AKTEYW43/ref...</a><p>If anyone wants to find serious information about nutrition, you should search for meta-studies, for example by the Cochrane Collaboration, and then you should read the abstract very carefully and not insert your wishful thinking into it.",1454295126

Browser rendering engines used to be NIH proprietary behemoths and IE6 was the pinnacle of the failure of that model. Graphics APIs and hardware are another great example - game developers are writing broken shaders that driver developers need to work around because the API is broken and the hardware is undocumented proprietary bullshit. Then you end up with insanity like Nvidia having the de-facto standard OpenGL implementation in the industry such that a ton of OpenGL programs break on AMD drivers because they don&#x27;t have nuances and breakages of the Nvidia one.<p>But gradually people realize that its not a profit center to be a closed source broken douchebag. Either the industry goes through the pain of correcting the damage (gecko / webkit / blink / etc) or just abandons the insanity (Metal / Vulkan / DX12 / Mantle).<p>The thing is we are not putting any financial pressure on motherboard makers to not be complete proprietary douchebags. Libreboot and Coreboot are at best infant hobbyist projects with extremely low penetration and they take half a decade to support products or just ship firmware blobs that were half the problem in the first place anyway (cough, Chromebooks). Network routers used to be that way, until the grassroots OpenWRT projects were so succesful manufacturers started making sure their routers were supported (TP-Link / Linksys) or even in the best scenario selling hardware running open source firmware (Buffalo). This <i>needs</i> to happen with x86 chipsets and motherboards desperately because UEFI is making the ACPI mess worse when the answer has been obvious this whole time - open documentation and specifications and working together rather than working in secret.",1454293731

Depending on who you talk to this may include: hire more police officers, accept more refugees from Syria, record and analyze everyone&#x27;s conversations and movement, stop bombing civilian populations, expel all Muslims, and withdraw US forces and other support from the Middle East.<p>As this article specifically supports Israeli methods to &quot;track down enemies of the Israeli state&quot;, I&#x27;ll add that I support Sweden&#x27;s position and its recognition of the Palestinian state.<p>In that context, note also the statement &quot;[suppose] a large percentage of people from Country X have performed some form of terrorist attacks in last years.&quot; Who do you think that &quot;Country X&quot; is supposed to be? To elaborate, I think there&#x27;s a clear implication that the author of this scenario believes that a large percentage of the people in Palestine have recently performed terrorist acts.<p>Bear in mind that the US estimates there are no more than 200,000 terrorists in the world.

From the US perspective there are no countries where &#x27;a large percentage of people ... have performed some form of terrorist attacks in last years&#x27;, making the scenario pointless.

It observed various issues e-gold had had, such as being physically located in the US (though theoretically registered in a country friendly to money laundering), and intentionally fixed these bugs with the intent of being the most robust money laundering operation it could be.<p>This ended up not working out, which is why the vacuum that urgently desires a money laundering operation has replicated the same hub-and-spokes model with the hub being a cryptocurrency (presently Bitcoin) and the spokes being exchanges and LocalBitcoins sellers.  The onramps/offramps to Bitcoin are exposed to a variety of ways to curtail their operations but the central trusted DB required for them to cooperate is not controlled by anyone who can be conveniently extradited.  People in the Bitcoin community refer to this obliquely as either &quot;censorship resistance&quot; or &quot;resistance to policy attacks.&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re interested in the history of this, Paypal and e-gold were approximately contemporaries, and one of the reasons Paypal succeeded and e-gold did not was that Paypal conspicuously courted respectability, so that even if Paypal was also doing hundreds of millions of dollars of fraud and illicit transactions it would be unlikely to indict them as a criminal enterprise because they were a proper company whose lawyers wore suits and whose VCs were quite respectable.

Instead, to fiddle with EFI vars (which happen to include the OS&#x27;s kernel-module code-signing grant store, which is how people most often run into rootless) you have to reboot into the recovery partition.<p>In other words, instead of creating a custom BIOS setup as a special UEFI app with privileges that the OS <i>never</i> has, Apple has instead given OSX the equivalent of SysV runlevels—and then made EFI only writable in the single-user maintenance runlevel. Instead of transitioning between these runlevel-equivalents &quot;online&quot;, you reboot between them; and instead of being modes of the same OS image, they&#x27;re two distinct copies of the same OS. But the usage semantics are the same.<p>(The key to security here, if you&#x27;re wondering, is that the recovery OS is a single solid image that&#x27;s been code-signed as a whole, with the signer&#x27;s pubkey kept in another EFI var. The live OS can&#x27;t just be made to overwrite the recovery OS into something malicious, <i>even though</i> the live OS has full control of the disk it sits on and <i>is</i> responsible for replacing the recovery OS when it receives updates.)<p>Personally, I think something similar might be the best solution for Linux as well. People are suggesting something like a wrapper program, but a wrapper can still be used maliciously. It&#x27;s far easier to secure a &quot;maintenance mode&quot; of the OS that must be rebooted into, and doesn&#x27;t bring up the network; such a mode necessitates (remote virtual) console access to actually do what you want, rather than allowing you to simply trigger off a destructive EFI op over SSH.<p>This can still be <i>automated</i>; your automation just needs to be able to speak to the remote console. And tools like grub-install can still work; they just need one program on the live-image side and one on the recovery-mode side, where the live OS&#x27;s grub-install just records your desired changes, sets the recovery-mode flag, and reboots; and where the recovery-mode grub-install agent reads the file, actually performs the op, unsets the flag, and reboots back.",1454293172

The biggest thing you can&#x27;t get documentation for is the $10 thunderbolt controller some boards have, for asinine reasons.

This form of communication includes different sorts of warning calls, and perhaps also vocalizations for identification.<p>Any human language would have developed from a similar sort of proto-language, without an a-ha moment when two humans finally invented the language.

In that case, the population of the original speakers would be small. According to the paper you gave, &quot;phoneme number decreases as a population gets smaller.&quot; Thus, it would suggest the first language had a low phoneme count.<p>The problem is, that guideline isn&#x27;t useful for the timescale we&#x27;re talking about. It&#x27;s believed there was a genetic bottleneck some 50,000 to 100,000 years ago (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_bottleneck#Humans"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_bottleneck#Humans</a> ). All living humans come from a relatively small and relatively recent population, which means all of the diverse languages of Africa come from an originally quite small population, which therefore would have had a lower phoneme number.<p>Thus, on the flip side, what happens when populations get larger and isolated? Proto-Indo-European shows that it only takes a few thousand years to develop German and Celtic from the same language, and we know modern language can have sounds that weren&#x27;t in the parent languages.<p>So while the principle might be useful for migrations within the last 10,000 years, that&#x27;s still quite recent in the evolution of humans.",1454292218

The company deducts the appropriate amount of Australian PAYG tax based on that salary, which is sent to the ATO once a quarter.<p>The company is then taxed on any profit it makes - but that&#x27;s typically low/none, because the salary paid to me is an expense for the business, and I can control the amount I get paid so I make sure that income - expenses = 0.",1454292139

If it&#x27;s the other way around (as an average), the company is going to be bankrupt.<p>My go-to catch phrase is: If you don&#x27;t like how things are run, you can &quot;change your organization&quot; or you can &quot;change your organization&quot;. I.E. you can either put effort into fixing things, or you can put effort into finding a new job.<p>You can plan your strategy based on the value that your team is providing. If your team costs $X and you&#x27;re making $4<i>X, you&#x27;ve got pretty solid leverage to state that you guys know what you&#x27;re doing and want to make things better (or you&#x27;ll leave). Alternatively, if you&#x27;re at $0.9</i>X ROI, you can probably make a good argument that you can turn things around from losing money to making money.",1454292095

Ordinarily it&#x27;s been pretty much a neglected language which is kind of a shame because it can be highly capable and adaptable.<p>Like the author, I learned Tcl/Tk back in the &#x27;90s.  I needed to have certain tools for running my business and there weren&#x27;t affordable off-the-shelf apps available.  Especially so for Linux which we were starting to use.  There were adequate C GUI libs at the time, but writing, for example, a networked scheduling app in C was a complex, daunting task.<p>Then I discovered Tcl/Tk, I was amazed how relatively simple it was to create the UI, connect the logic and maintain the &quot;separation of concerns&quot; between them.  Also the Tcl event loop model made writing network backend database, server and client interaction fairly straightforward.  Client/server connections were made persistent, sort of reminiscent of the websocket protocol.<p>I guess these experiences echo the article&#x27;s idea, that Tcl/Tk anticipated some of the facilities the &quot;web stack&quot; is trying to provide near 20 years later.  We know Tcl doesn&#x27;t have the appeal of other languages, perhaps many consider Tcl to be &quot;weird&quot;, and it may well be.  However, a case could be made that the thousands of extant web frameworks and other current-day &quot;tooling&quot; are no less peculiar, and certainly don&#x27;t offer the versatility and staying power that Tcl/Tk has shown.<p>Of course we can&#x27;t undo history, but I&#x27;ve often wondered how the web would look today if way back when Tcl had been chosen as the browser language.  Maybe what the author of the article was trying to do was ask that sort of question.",1454292003

I have used 1and1, NameCheap, ipowerweb, yahoo, etc.<p>GoDaddy may suck balls for a lot of things, but they are the best that I've found for having multiple domains. I don't have a lot, just a dozen or so active - but the interface is sweet, fast, and very easy to do domain locking/unlocking, nameservers, multiple edits, etc.<p>Of course, I'm not authority. This is just me saying what I've done, and what I like.",1224665771

Nope.<p>Isn't a blog supposed to be personal? The mentioned sites aren't really blogs, so the article is irrelevant.<p>Blogs still matter when it comes to details that aren't discussed in the media. In my native language blog posts and forum discussions are among the top results and I often learn more and understand my country better from this content than from the PR-dominated media.<p>I am glad that some of the bloggers I read have started micro-blogging - I am not interested in reading what they ate for dinner last night.<p>I like traditional personal webpages.",1224665566

A client will ask one or more designers to each submit one or more designs with no guarantee of getting paid unless their work is selected as the winning bid.<p>It should not be confused with pro bono work, where the work is unpaid but the relationship between client and designer is transparent.<p>The practice is by no means limited to the design industry, but due to the nature of work involved, is where it is most rampant.",1224665353

339843,comment,339540,339540,0,0,markessien,,,"'Talent' is not something anybody should be proud of having. Everybody is born with a particular advantage over other people in some particular area. Some discover this advantage and put it to good use. Others do not, or never have the chance to develop it. So 'Talent' is irrelevant, because everybody has it.<p>The thing to be proud of is discovering your talent and actually putting it to use in a way that benefits you or other people.<p>In a church choir, there are tons of people talented in singing. But they don't try to develop or focus on those talents.<p>And of the programming crew here, perhaps some of you could have turned out to be the greatest footballers in the world. But you may not even know that the balance and co-ordination for this is within you. Instead you're here writing medicore PHP code.<p>To develop a talent, one needs a positive feedback loop. Many people don't get that in the area they have natural abilities in.<p>So, talent is irrelevant. Everyone has it. It's the development of the talent that counts.",1224664247

The memcached server does the former, which only needs to ensure low hash collisions for the keys itself is storing, the client software does the latter.  You couldn't have a single memcached instance that is terabytes anyway -- can you even get a machine that would take a terabyte of RAM? -- which is why you scale memcached by adding more memcached instances.",1224663673

The exponent 7FF (in binary: all ones) is reserved for <i>special values</i>: NaN and infinity. If the fraction is 0 (all zeroes), then the number is +/- inf, otherwise it is a NaN.<p>NaN-tagging works by using the unused variations of NaN for pointers. The trick is that most processors only generate a single binary pattern for NaN, so all other binary patterns are never used to represent floating point numbers, and can thus be used to represent pointers.

That would provide peace of mind which I currently don't have about their services. I'm sure having this would also free up their support as quite a few people seem to go over limits by mistake.<p>A little experimental app could easily start to overrun limits without the user knowing and run up a huge bill, and this is the only thing about their service which I found unsettling - it gives the impression they're happy to trick you into paying more than you wanted, which I'm sure is not the intended one.",1350027481

4644094,comment,4643304,4644006,3,0,rayiner,,,"A conservative GC requires the application to obey certain ""typical"" behaviors. One of those behaviors is ""natural"" alignment of structures. Most C compilers will align pointers in structures to the word size of the architecture, inserting padding if necessary. In your example, padding would be inserted between ""b"" and ""c"" to align ""c"" to 32-bits and between ""f"" and ""g"" to align ""g"" to 64-bits (assuming this is a 64-bit machine). So the GC can scan an object a word at a time and be sure it'll hit all pointers. Note that using compiler directives that pack structures as tightly as possible, ignoring natural alignments, can break this assumption.<p>As for your other questions, remember that a conservative GC manages objects allocated through it, not just random objects in the system. It can use allocator metadata to keep track of where objects start and how long they are.* It aligns objects to some multiple of the word size, and can ignore any bit pattern that doesn't point to some multiple of 4 or 8 bytes. It also knows the extents of its own heap. As its scanning pointers, it does some checks to see if a particular bit-pattern points outside of the heap or does not point to the beginning of an object. If a possible pointer passes all of these tests, it definitely points to an object. It might not actually be a real pointer, but the target is actually an object managed by the GC.<p>On a 64-bit machine, it's actually fairly rare for a random ""int"" or ""double"" to be mistaken for a pointer. Most ""ints"" are small integers, and on a 64-bit machine the heap is almost always allocated above 4GB. Similarly, the odds of a 64-bit double bit pattern pointing inside the heap out of all those exabytes of heap is unlikely.<p>*) This is similar to how a malloc implementation might use allocator metadata to know how big a chunk is for a free() call.",1350025731

4644089,comment,4643892,4644052,6,0,sarnowski,,,"Yeah I had FreeBSD on the route before OpenBSD. FreeBSD was a very disappointing experience for me. This is some years back so the situation may be better. Back then, a lot of ports were broken. It felt that every second port did not compile. The second thing was that FreeBSD is like most Linux distributions: It tries to support everything and that is bad. If you have a problem and ask how you solve that with FreeBSD you mostly get the answer: you can use X or Y or Z. X has this disadvantages, Y was not updated for years and Z has no documentation. I also tried to try NetBSD but it panic'ed on all my machines during boot.<p>Disclaimer: I am an OpenBSD fanboy because it opened my eyes. OpenBSD's base system already solves 90% of my problems with exactly one, perfectly maintained and documented solution. You want a firewall? Choose between pf, netfilter or something else on FreeBSD. On OpenBSD the answer is ""use pf"" (which is btw by far the best paket filter I every experienced). The port system just works, is up-to-date and has good default configurations (and I never missed a package). Maintenance is very easy. It is not as easy as apt-get update && upgrade but the release upgrade (every 6 months) never broke anything on my systems (and takes just 10 minutes). Besides that, there is nearly nothing to do. Here is the bug/update list of the current release (5 months old): <a href=""http://openbsd.org/errata51.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openbsd.org/errata51.html</a>\nThe last thing I want to mention now is the consistency in all tools. For network configuration there is ifconfig which can just handle everything (e.g. on linux you have to use special tools for wlan). You have great manual pages. The manual pages are real manual pages with introductions to the systems, various high level topics down to device nodes etc. They are completely up-to-date and the best source for all informations.",1350025580

I must thank to these operating systems I have the sysadmin skills I have now ;) Back then (I don't know if things have changed) you had to upgrade <i>the system</i>, while in Linux you could download the latest version from kernel.org, compile and install (ABI/API didn't change frequently, at least).<p>This different philosophy has pros and cons, and I believe one of the consequences is that Linux is more popular than BSD.",1350025527

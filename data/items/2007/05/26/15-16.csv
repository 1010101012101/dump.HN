Yes, almost everything that is created is copyrighted to the creator, automatically.<p>The only items that have no copyrights are public domain items.  The only way to have public domain items are after the copyrights expire many years later, or if the copyright owner declares it so before the time it happens automatically.<p>I agree that scribd should try it and see what FaceBook says later.  I was just pointing something out of interest to them since nobody else probably actually reads those agreements. :)",1180194444

24802,comment,24760,24761,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I'm working as an employee for one startup and a founder of another, in two totally different business domains (financial software and internet games, respectively).<p>It's hard.  Startups take more out of you than a regular job will, because you can't just switch into maintenance mode.  There've been times where my boss has had a demo for an important client one week (making me work nights & weekends for a couple days to get it ready), and then I've gone straight to preparing a launch for the startup.<p>I don't think I really could've done it differently, though.  I wanted to work at a startup so I could get experience & a sense of what I was getting myself into, and this is my first job since college.  The day job is essentially funding my startup - it pays better than YCombinator, with similar advice & experience benefits.  I thought about switching to a less intensive job at a big company, but I dunno if they'd hire me when I already have a startup on the side.  Plus, I have a pretty good relationship with my boss and the IP policy is relatively lenient at my current employer, reducing the chance of IP problems (he doesn't care as long as I'm not starting a competitor, basically).<p>Overall, I wouldn't recommend it unless you're in a similar situation - first job out of college, self-funding, and want the training of a startup.  If you're older and already have plenty of experience with business, I'd get a job at a big blue chip where nobody knows what anybody else is doing - a coworker said that Thomson Financial is great for this, almost everybody has their own private business that they run out of their cube because the company is incapable of getting anything done itself.  If you can get YCombinator or similar funding, I'd take that: you're trading equity for time, which is usually a good tradeoff.  If you can afford to, quit your day job and live off savings (I'll probably do this fairly soon, but I want a little more runway so my startup has a greater margin of safety).",1180193623

I like the idea of asking the content authors to tip you in turn when you pass the tips onto them, but is it those tips that you're relying on to cover costs or do you ask me, the original tipster, to cough up the tips + a processing fee?<p>It's a great idea and I'd like to see it succeed.",1180192166

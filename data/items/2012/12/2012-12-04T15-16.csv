Whereas Mubarak basically crushed secularist dissent, he seemed to tolerate the Muslim Brotherhood (on a very short leash) for use as boogeymen. They were also able to organize in mosques, which were more or less untouchable, whereas nobody else had such a safe place to organize. Finally, the Mubarak regime was largely secularist, which tainted other liberals by association.<p>The end result was that, after the revolution, the Muslim Brotherhood had a very well-organized political network ready to go, while everyone else was going, ""Hmm ... time to form a political party.

For that reason, while I also find those comments to be irritating I'm still in favor of a requirement that they be present for anything that's meant to be consumed by third parties.<p>Also, it sounds like some of the problem you're describing could have as much to do with people being slackers about the rule, than the rule itself. Someone should be taking charge of making sure these XML comments are useful, high-quality comments.  There's almost always more information that should be provided beyond re-iterating the element's name.  For example, the XML comments for a property named ""IsValid"" should reference some documentation of exactly what defines a valid state for that class.  Numeric properties should very likely have notes about what unit denominates them.  At the absolute least, make sure that every property's descriptive comment starts with ""Gets"", ""Sets"", or ""Gets or sets"".<p>Just to get in ahead of an obvious answer, let me also go ahead and say that if this is a situation where it's reasonable to tell users that they should just RTFS, then obviously this is a situation where there's not necessarily any need to require XML comments in the first place.  But if you do need to require XML comments, you should also be requiring <i>proper</i> XML comments.",1354636611

And when your request does need it, you should prefer mysql_pconnect() over mysql_connect() for the simple reason that it potentially shaves some execution time off the connection part.</i><p>Actually you should avoid using both mysql_pconnect and mysql_connect, because they're both functions from the deprecated old mysql library of database functions. The preferred way to deal with MySQL databases in 2012 is to use either PDO (<a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php</a>) or the ""improved MySQL"" library (<a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php</a>), both of which are better architected and give you access to things like prepared statements that the old mysql library does not.<p>There's really no good reason to be using the old mysql library at this point. Unfortunately, however, there's a vast amount of ancient PHP tutorials, code snippets, and other copypasta floating around out there that uses it, so people who don't know better still pick it up.",1354636503

This means a company that has no physical presence in a country but sells products digitally there has no taxes due (except sales tax/VAT in the EU in some cases if over a certain threshold).<p>The issue in the case of Amazon, Starbucks et all in the UK right now is that these companies DO have a local permanent establishment, but manage to minimize their corporate tax through a mechanism called ""transfer pricing"", whereby they pay their sister branches in lower tax jurisdictions license fees etc for using brand, IP, software systems etc, thus increasing their tax deductible expenses in the high tax jurisdiction (UK).<p>What's useful to note is that none of this would be possible without double taxation agreements and the EU, both which successive UK govts and tax authorities have painstakingly and explicitly negotiated and agreed to.
If there are no double taxation treaties, taxes for cross-border payments would in fact be quite punitive (withholding taxes etc).<p>It seems to me the UK govt thought they would benefit from these agreements when they where originally negotiated, but it has not turned out to be the case. The whole ""moral outrage"" is just the government passing the buck on a ball they themselves dropped.<p>As a side note, I don't believe moral outrage is conducive to the rule of law.

The weight of an unreasonably tall tower could cause it, but we know that such an unreasonably tall tower can't exist because of stability concerns. So: what actually limits the height of a Lego tower? Elastic buckling, or some other kind of buckling, or is it something weird because of the friction fit of Lego bumps in the bottom of the block above?  That's where the really interesting stuff comes into play.  The Prague tower in the picture appears to have a square cross section, but is it hollow, or solid?  What special construction techniques did they use, or is it just a matter of craftsmanship and selecting exactly nominal bricks for construction?",1354633883

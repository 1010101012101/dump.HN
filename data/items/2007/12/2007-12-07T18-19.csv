Still, it's good to sully wikipedia's reputation a little because some people put far, far too much faith in wikipedia's ""facts"".",1197053626

Even government sponsored R&D requires a free market to blossom. Of course growth of truly creative forces requires a pull back of power.<p>Put another way, you'll never get dynamic distributed growth through top-down decision making.<p>Yes, they need to give up power. If they don't, the change won't happen.",1197053594

We had a couple of phone calls from ""customers"" who (we are 99% certain) were our competitors almost immediately after we launched.<p>They weren't intelligent enough to <i>""control the conversation and information flow""</i> though :-) But it was nice to pause for a second and realize that two guys with some spare coding time had built something to make existing businesses a bit worried.",1197052002

87064,comment,86506,87048,0,0,anamax,,,"> Letting people start businesses and reap the rewards is probably all that is needed. <p>My poorly-expressed point is that that's not really a ""push"" so much as it is a pulling back by the leader's organization, a giving up of power.  Worse yet, it's allowing potentially competitive powers.<p>Orgs and their leaders gain power by controlling.  Creating by giving up power is very different.",1197050510

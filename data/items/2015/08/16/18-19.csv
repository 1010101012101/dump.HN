For example, when I turn off styles (Firefox), the numbers appear as a vertical list, which is fabulous, but they&#x27;re in no particular order. Which means that javascript is ordering them. It wouldn&#x27;t have been that difficult to order them once, and serve them in order (you have to serve them somehow anyway). And then it would have been useful/interesting to curmudgeons like me who sometimes turn styles off to see what happens.<p>Similar, when I look at the site with a text browser, I get a note saying I need javascript. To take some pressure off the server. A simple ordered vertical list would not have been unreasonable, and made the site more useful to more people.<p>In general, you should try to physically order your content in a sensible way, before rendering, to make it more useful to text browsers and visually impaired people using reader software.<p>My little peeve.

But is my memory rusty?<p>The ball looks like it&#x27;s about 128 pixels wide and 100 pixels high, so 8 words x 100 rows. Note how the screen appears to be laid out in a bitplane-minded fashion: you have a 1 plane backdrop, a 1 plane shadow, and a 2-plane bouncing ball. So, you don&#x27;t have to mask in your background when writing. Load source, write dest.<p>You&#x27;d pre-shift your ball lots of times to make this go quickly. (The shifted copies would have the ball&#x27;s rotation applied, so you&#x27;d get a two-for-one with this.) One ball = 8 words * 2 bitplanes * 100 rows = 3,200 bytes. Plenty of room, even with 512K.<p>So your loop for one row will go something like this, I guess. Assume A0 points to your 2-plane sprite data, arranged bitplane 0, bitplane 1, bitplane 0, bitplane 1, and so on, for 8 words, then your 1-plane shadow data, again 8 words. Assume A1 points to bitplane 0.<p>First draw the ball:<p><pre><code>    MOVEM.L (A0)+,D0-D7 ; 76\n    MOVE.L D0,(A1)+     ; 12\n    MOVE.L D1,1*8-4(A1) ; 16\n    MOVE.L D2,2*8-4(A1) ; 16\n    MOVE.L D3,3*8-4(A1) ; 16\n    MOVE.L D4,4*8-4(A1) ; 16\n    MOVE.L D5,5*8-4(A1) ; 16\n    MOVE.L D6,6*8-4(A1) ; 16\n    MOVE.L D7,7*8-4(A1) ; 16\n</code></pre>\nSo, 200 cycles per line.<p>Then draw the shadow in the same sort of way into bitplane 2 (this is the reason for the (A1)+ and the -4s everywhere above - it lets you start off with (A1) here, rather than 4(A1), saving you 4 cycles).<p><pre><code>    MOVEM.W (A0)+,D0-D7 ; 44\n    MOVE.W D0,(A1)      ; 8\n    MOVE.W D1,1*8(A1)   ; 12\n    MOVE.W D2,2*8(A1)   ; 12\n    (and so on, as above)\n</code></pre>\nSo, for that, 136 cycles per line.<p>Cycles per frame = 8,000,000/50 = 160,000; cycles per ball = (200+136)*100 = 33,600.<p>Taking into account that you&#x27;d have to erase the old ball and its shadow, and you&#x27;d have to advance your pointer from row to row, and whatnot - maybe 25% in total?",1439750850

10069835,comment,10066727,10068352,0,0,henrytcs,,,"That&#x27;s the right intuition. But here we have to distinguish between <i>information theoretic randomness</i> and <i>computational randomness</i> (also known as <i>algorithmic randomness</i>). In the former, we&#x27;re guaranteed that the output is actually statistically close to uniform randomness, and no statistical test, no matter how much computing time it uses, can predict any bit of the output. In the latter, the output can actually be far from uniformly random, but it has the guarantee that no efficient program (i.e. polynomial time algorithm) can distinguish between the output, and true uniform randomness.<p>A randomness extractor guarantees the former (i.e. information theoretic randomness), whereas a cryptographic hash function can only, at best, guarantee the latter (i.e. computational randomness). One might say, for all intents and purposes, we only care about computational randomness anyways. The problem is, cryptographic hash functions only work under complexity assumptions that we don&#x27;t know to be true. These complexity assumptions have a similar flavor to the P vs NP question, which you might&#x27;ve heard of.<p>On the other hand, we can actually outright prove that randomness extractors work, and they output information theoretic randomness -- no complexity assumptions required!<p>So, long story short, we&#x27;d like to <i>theoretically ensure</i>, and prove outright, that we can take weak sources of randomness, and amplify them to strong sources of randomness. Randomness extractors do just that.",1439750763

10069827,comment,10069527,10069527,0,0,jeffmould,,,"From your wording, it sounds more like you are trying to structure the amount you are trying to raise based on each VC you are meeting with. If this is the case, IMO, this is the wrong approach. Before you start meeting with VCs you need to figure out what the minimum and maximum you want to raise is. From there agree on a number internally and present that number as part of your pitch. You should then seek out potential investors that invest in that range, and that are more importantly a match for the type of business you are in. Don&#x27;t fluctuate your raise solely based on the VC you are meeting with.<p>It also sounds like you are just scheduling meetings to have meetings, without really determining if the investor is even a good fit for your company at all. Look at previous portfolio companies and any press around them. Prior to scheduling a meeting do your own due diligence on the investor to understand what their range is and how they invest (are they a lead, prefer to co-invest with others, etc..). That way prior to even scheduling a meeting you are not wasting each other&#x27;s time meeting with someone who only invests at X round or doesn&#x27;t invest less than X dollars.<p>My recommendation would be to determine what the minimum amount you need to raise is based on a clear timeline and milestones. From there add a bit of a cushion, but don&#x27;t over shoot the number enormously. In your pitch clearly layout how much you are raising and what that raise will get you too (what milestones and how long will that money last). If the investor is serious as you discuss further with them you may find your valuation changes slightly or the amount you are willing to give up changes slightly. Never ask for less than you need. The amount you ask should always be based on what that money will achieve as far as milestones. The investor wants to know what their money is buying. For example, will $1M get you to $10000MRR or will $1M only get you to $1000MRR.<p>Also, as a side note, your question in general comes off as skeptical about your whether your business can succeed down the road. Statements like &quot;we understand our place in the dynamically changing market&quot;, &quot;make sure nobody loses&quot;, are I am sure well intended, but at first glance raise a red flag (at least to me) about whether there is a chance the business will be viable in a year. This may be just me reading into your question, but if not you may want to be cautious with your wording in meetings.",1439750646

Almost all of the college students in my family went with Windows on a laptop or a hybrid.<p>I have Fedora F21 running and it&#x27;s probably the best performing Linux desktop that I&#x27;ve seen and the most usable (after taking away all of the OS X idioms of course), but unless the only thing you want to do is run Chrome more slowly than you could on Windows, then I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for normals (edit: because from what I&#x27;ve seen, it&#x27;s generally a buggier environment than Windows. Now that could be mostly because I installed a bunch of buggy plugins for Gnome, but I also had hardware issues that Windows did not have).",1439750457

Fenomas raises a good point that I completely glossed over in my post, which is what it means for something to be random or unpredictable.<p>Indeed, one can&#x27;t ever <i>know</i> for certain whether a sequence of numbers is random (after all, the universe we live in could be a deterministic finite state automaton). Instead, in this context of randomness extractors, we simply assume there is such thing as random numbers, and that there are sources of randomness that are more random than others. For example, a uniformly random sequence of 100 bits is more random than a random sequence of 100 bits where the last bit is always the XOR of the previous 99 bits.<p>Like someone else mentioned, we can quantify the quality of a random source by its entropy (more specifically, min-entropy, but ignore that for now). A randomness extractor operates under the premise that its inputs are sources with some amount of entropy (but maybe not full entropy). Its output is supposed to be a random source with full entropy (it distills &quot;all the good stuff&quot; from the sources).<p>One might find some philosophical difficulty with the idea that we can ever obtain sources with perfect randomness -- or know that we have. But the point of a randomness extractor is to say, if you believe that you have access to sources with <i>some</i> amount of entropy, then you can use an extractor to obtain sources with full entropy.<p>I hope this makes sense.",1439749788

Maybe you will too?<p>I&#x27;ve travelled extensively over the last decade before settling down about a year ago - I spent time in Europe (west and east), Russia, China, Japan, Australia, Subsaharan Africa, the Amazon and North America. What I find fascinating is that you can figuratively draw sets of what each culture cares about. The intersection is, more-or-less, what it means to be human.<p>Obviously you need a significantly large sample size, but broadly speaking everyone wants somewhere comfortable to sleep and family and trusted, non-familial companions. Everyone wants what they consider to be good food (although the definition of &#x27;good&#x27; changes somewhat). Everyone wants to look after their kids and have some sort of ritual to pass on knowledge culture and usually possessions to their offspring. Most cultures have music and dancing of some sort - both participatory and as entertainment. Every culture wants what it considers impressive to be considered impressive by outsiders. Every culture I&#x27;ve seen is more open to outsiders when they smile - I&#x27;ve learned to smile, to use body language and to relax more in unfamiliar surroundings.<p>Once I started to see these commonalities, I realised what&#x27;s unique about my own culture - I started to understand myself  better, and see myself more in relation to the society in which I was embedded. I became kinder, and more understanding of people seeming stupid or ill-educated; I became less tolerant of people behaving aggressively or using status-hierarchies to dominate others.

For a fee, you could get one that was slightly less horrible to use too.  But still.<p>&quot;Happily&quot;, in Objecteering version 6, I&#x27;m told they switched to java instead, and indeed nowadays the offspring of Objecteering, Modelio, is based on eclipse and uses Java.<p>Two other examples coming to mind are:<p>- AutoCAD, with its infamous AutoLISP.  Not that lisp be a bad embedded programming language, on the contrary, if you look at emacs and its emacs lisp (which is not the best of the lisps around but still let us write nice lisp programs, from the small punctual customization to whole applications (emacs has spreadsheets, web browsers, database management systems, games, IDEs, anything written in emacs lisp)), or embeddable full Common Lisp implementations such as ecl (libecl.so) or other less well known lisps provided as libraries to be embedded in applications.  But amongst the lisps, AutoLISP is one of the worst.  Not as bad as Gosling&#x27;s MockLisp, the (pseudo) lisp that was used in Gosling&#x27;s Emacs, but still bad.<p>- CYC and OpenCyc have a CycL lisp like language that&#x27;s also quite bad, from the language point of view.  It&#x27;s a wonder, given the availablility of ecl, why people insist on designing their own half assed bad lisp, instead of just embedding Common Lisp.  Or even scheme, there are some quite good scheme implementations that you could embed in applications...<p>There&#x27;s of course also:<p>- AppleScript. What an horror!  I mean, I can understand that 30 or 40 years after the COBOL experiment, they wanted to try it again to see whether they could at least design a programming language using an English subset that any non-programmer could use to script their system and applications.  But this SHOULD HAVE STAYED IN THE FUCKING LABORATORY! as a clearly failed experiment.<p>And anything &quot;4G&quot; and &quot;integrated&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t give you more examples, since as I mentionned above, it&#x27;s generally a very difficult experience, I try to avoid anything related to &quot;proprietary&quot; programming languages, so it&#x27;s difficult to have an exhaustive list.<p>Now we have to be careful to distinguish &quot;proprietary&quot; programming language, (where the purpose is to provide a &quot;Turing-complete&quot; programming language to write scripts or high level applications), from  DSL, Domain Specific Languages, that can have notions, notations and syntaxes that may seem strange on the first look, but that are justified by the existing habits and usages of a given community of users in a given domain.  You may find in application some domain specific language that may look strange but that fulfill completely the need of their users.  The problem only comes when they want to have programmers use them.",1439749449

The softer version is that there <i>appear</i> to be mathematical objects with independent existence, even though there is no a priori philosophical reason to believe in their independent existence, and there are indeed reasons to doubt it (e.g. non-standard models of not only the reals, but also the natural numbers).<p>One reason I find it hard to reject Platonism entirely is that the main alternative in the philosophy of mathematics, Formalism, looks to me like a kind of Platonism.  This is because formalism replaces belief in the independent existence of mathematical objects (real numbers, integers) with belief in the independent existence of meta-mathematical objects (theorems, proofs) which most formalists conceive of in mathematical terms.<p>Ultimately I think that there is no a priori limit that we can place on how science is going to pan out, and how this will affect our philosophy.  E.g. I find the idea of multiple universes distasteful and nonsensical (e.g. If everything possible happens, then how can we interpret probabilities?  Why do we live in a universe where macro observations are consistent with applying the law of large numbers to quantum randomness? I can&#x27;t think of any anthropic/observer based principle that would enforce this) but I can&#x27;t yet rule out that that&#x27;s really how things are.",1439749183

Choosing RF as our path forward means we throw in the towel on that one and accept that people will always have to regulate their appetite for bandwidth.<p>Are there technical reasons we can&#x27;t use 4G/LTE to provide the same service, or simply the strategies of the carriers to extract the most rent possible from the least infrastructure?<p>An enormous portion of the spectrum is reserved for military and government.

I dislike how they decontextualize the conversation and how they require trust in an additional resource. Eg, when I come across a gist during a web search, it&#x27;s hard to figure out the point.<p>By comparison, an email provides the full context, and is easier to integrate into a workflow. For example, I can drag an attachment directly into my editor. A gist requires additional steps.<p>Regarding hnnotify.com, I enjoy the ability to let go of most HN threads after a couple of days. This thread one of a handful of exceptions. Can I really subscribe to one-and-only-one thread? I don&#x27;t see that&#x27;s it&#x27;s worthwhile to set up a third-party account and active the service for a rare event. In any case, if it takes a month for bmh100 to evaluate the code then the HN thread will be closed, so there&#x27;s only a narrow window for which this service is useful.<p>I do not share your optimism in the random contributions of others. To start, it&#x27;s not like I haven&#x27;t talked about this before. See <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/dalke/smilez"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/dalke/smilez</a> and <a href=""http://www.dalkescientific.com/writings/diary/archive/2007/06/25/smiles_states.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dalkescientific.com/writings/diary/archive/2007/0...</a> (under &quot;Compressing SMILES&quot;) for two examples. Have I gotten <i>any</i> feedback about them? No. So why put more effort into hoping for a one-in-a-million event, which is what you suggest, instead of optimizing the chance of getting a followup from someone who specifically expressed interest? Experience says that I should optimize for the latter.<p>What is your interest in the SMILES notation that can&#x27;t be resolved through <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_lin...</a> ? I would be glad to tell you more. I have worked with different aspects of SMILES for over 15 years and co-authored the OpenSMILES specification. I have also written many blog posts about different aspects of how to work with SMILES. And gotten few followups.<p>What skill set do you have, that I might tailor a response? Are you comfortable installing from source, do you prefer one of the GNU/Linux packaging systems, or Mac/homebrew? Or are you happiest with extracting data from a database dump? My &#x27;synopsis .. of possible alternatives&#x27; was more an offer to follow up on any of those options, but was of itself incomplete. It works because email has the implied statement that I will respond to further questions.<p>If you don&#x27;t have specific interest, are more generically wanting to be informed, then perhaps you can understand why I would prefer to use other mechanism, like my blog posts, which are more likely to get the kinds of responses I&#x27;m looking for than spending time tuning an off-topic HN comment.",1439748581

The last one was about the ""Tying of Internet Explorer to Windows"", this one could be about the ""Tying of Cloud Offerings to Windows""<p>To me it seems that when users are going to upgrade to or buy Windows 8, they will probably opt-in to cloud storage from Microsoft. Long term Microsoft may lock-in a very significant percentage of desktop, laptop, smartphone and tablet users to their services. It doesn't seem to be a level playing field for e.g. Dropbox.<p>More generally speaking, it looks like the big three have a strategy to use the OS as the 'gateway drug' to their online (cloud) offerings. By offering integrated always available API's to 3rd party developers they ensure the path of least resistance always leads towards iCloud, Google Docs/Drive and Windows Live/SkyDrive.<p>Microsoft still has a monopoly on the desktop as far as I can tell.

The number of <i>available</i> search results is now almost at 700.<p>Unless you are dead-set on having a specific name, there's no reason you should have to pay more than the $12 registration fee to pick up a decent domain name for your next site.<p>I'd even go so far as to say that as word of Lean Domain Search spreads (it's less than 5 weeks old), it will have a major impact on the premium domain name market for this very reason.

Avid is still the top gun, especially now that Apple redesigned FCP.

There are also good stand-alone packages that offer more precise control.<p>Audio is another prime indicator of production quality.  A perfectly shot video with poor audio is just as bad, if not worse, than a poorly shot video.  A good shotgun mic or lav mic will help greatly in this respect.  Always try to lower or eliminate as much environmental noise as possible and remember to record ambient noise (room silence) to mix in with the finished audio when needed.<p>I could go on and on, but there are plenty of resources for this stuff freely available.

Quite a few of author's ideas are not about bootstrapping gradually, they're about faking it.<p>But quite a few of those ideas <i>are</i> useful.<p>The only ones I thought were a bit out-there were the ones about ""just processing it in the cloud"" while the local copy is still loading. But other HNers are probably more qualified to judge how realistic this is.<p>What <i>is</i> a possibility, however, during loading a lot of time is spent on loading all sorts of modules, ones that might not even be used that session, and most definitely not in the first few minutes. Because what is the user going to do first? Most likely it'll be `File > Open ...` and browsing through the filesystem looking for whatever project they intend to open.<p>You don't need any plugins for that. And it's exactly the type of task that spends relatively a lot of time waiting for user input and not so much time computing or loading things. During this task the app can continue loading modules and plugins and the user doesn't have to wait because they're selecting a file.<p>You probably need to disable (most of) the instant preview in the file open dialog until it's done loading, but that's a minor trade-off.<p>Of course you're loading the modules necessary for opening files <i>first</i> (most recently used filetypes first). When that's done the dialog can start showing previews. <i>If</i> the user happens to have found and selected their file before it's done, then, <i>only then</i> they'll have to wait.<p>Now you're loading the file and it's showing on the screen, the user can browse the layers a bit and ponder where exactly they left off last time. A wonderful time to load the rest of the modules! Of course the features used in this project will be loaded first. If there's no text layers, we can put off loading font-rendering support in favour of other modules.<p>It's not all load-on-demand, but a lot of user tasks are not as processor- or data-intensive as you'd think, because the user is busy thinking and as long as the UI is responsive enough they're happy.",1329767020

""contact them and say I see you're not using xxxxx.com, I have a little project I'd like to use it for... would you be willing to let it go?"" etc. etc. etc. HORRIBLE ADVICE.<p>People that are sitting on domain names don't keep paying the registration fees every year for fun, even if they aren't using the name. They know it has value. So don't insult their intelligence making them think they should do you a favor by letting you have their unused domain.<p>Many Domain Owners Think They're Sitting On A Lottery Ticket<p>Many domain owners think that one day someone is going to come along and give them millions for their .Com no matter what it is. The fact is, domains are only worth what someone is ready to hand you a check for. (A tip to all you wannabe speculators.) I've seen many GREAT domains never get sold, so always keep that in mind. Anyway, because domain owners have this thinking, they are very reluctant to NAME A PRICE. So forcing them to start by naming a price isn't something they want to do, because they're hoping YOU offer some ridiculously high price that they will then counter to go much higher.<p>Because of this, you MUST start out on first contact with an offer (more on this in a second). The approach of ""would you be willing to sell xxxxx.com? If so, how much?"" isn't going to cut it; one of the main reasons is that domain owners of decent domains get TONS of emails all the time asking them that, and when they've replied in the past with a price or try to start negotiations so many people are only willing to pay $100 or some insulting price.<p>So what do most domain owners do? IGNORE YOU. That's right. So if you've ever contacted a domain owner after looking them up with a Whois search and they didn't reply, it's not because they didn't your email (which makes you think that follow-up fax or phone call will do the trick; HINT: it won't.) It's because they think you're like everyone else that thinks they can buy the domain for $100 or so.<p>Here's how you get their attention and get the ball rolling...<p>Rule #1: You must start out by making an offer in your initial email.<p>Rule #2: This offer must be high enough to get their attention and make them at least THINK.<p>NOTE: Rule #2's amount will depend on how great the domain is.<p>The two magic price points I have found that work the best (they depend on how valuable the domain is) is either $1,000 or $2,500.<p>If it's a great domain then $5K-$10K is usually the starting point. These amounts are enough to get anyone's attention. I've bought many $100K+ value domains for $15K-$20K by starting with a $5K or $7K offer.<p>By starting with at least something that gets their attention they will take you seriously. This is the first step or you have no chance to make a deal.<p>In most cases for decent 2 words domains, the $1K to $2.5K opener works best.<p>* TIP: Always know your seller if possible. Do a Whois on who owns the domain, visit the domain in their email address or do some Google searches, etc. You'll often find a struggling Web designer is sitting on a great domain. $1,000 cash to that person is a lot of money. So this also goes into the process of deciding what to open the offer with.<p>The key here is not to insult someone with a lowball offer, but offer enough to make them know you're a serious buyer.<p>So here's a sample initial contact email to send... (and I'll explain the rest of the language I use)...<p>Subject Line: Whatever.com ($2,500?)<p>Hi,<p>I see you are the owner of Whatever.com. I'm in the process of trying to find a domain name for a client I am building a web site for and think your name could be a good fit. I am contacting different domain owners as we have it in the budget to buy a cool name and Whatever.com is on the list we came up with.<p>Would you be interested in selling it for $2,500?<p>Let me know and I can have the funds wired to you next day or PayPal'd to you. Just let me know your PayPal address.<p>Thanks for your time.<p>-YOUR NAME\n-------------------------<p>Let's breakdown why I used that language...<p>1. You've positioned yourself as not the future 'owner' of the domain. You're just managing a budget for a project. This helps because as they will usually counter with a higher amount, you'll play the ""sorry, I just don't have it in the budget to go that high"" to work towards a price you want. You'll also be able to play the ""let me see if the client can approve a budget increase to accommodate that price"" etc. etc. This also allows you to play Good Cop, Bad Cop in a way. You're just someone trying to get the deal done to do your job (build the site). You're also presenting yourself as someone LESS EMOTIONALLY INVESTED IN THE NAME -- which will potentially keep the price down. (Trust me, it works very well.)<p>2. You mention that you're contacting several domain owners (i.e. making multiple offers). You're playing up SCARCITY, one of the most powerful emotions when it comes to sales. For all this person knows they could reply and say ""okay, I'll sell it"" but you may come back and say, ""sorry someone replied to our email first and now we have a domain.""<p>3. By closing with the ""we'll pay you right away"" it makes the offer more REAL. Many of these domain owners get offers that people back out of and have no intention to actually pay. And you're also ASSUMING THE SALE by saying, ""what's your PayPal address?"" :-)<p>Again, all of these things are very, very powerful and I have tweaked this initial contact email over the years.<p>ADDITIONAL TIPS<p>Let's say you initially offer $2,500 on a great name and the owner counters with, ""I couldn't sell it for that, I've had higher offers. I would never sell it for anything less than $10K.""<p>FIrst, you must IGNORE anything they say. You'll get the ""I've turned down higher offers"" response a lot. In the example response about $10K above, unless you would love to have it for $10K, just reply with something like this... ""While I do think your name is possibly worth $10K to someone, we just don't have the budget for that much, sorry. I could probably get something more like $5K-$7K approved, but even that's pushing it. Anyway, thanks for your time.""<p>That's it. Cut them off. Trust me, they'll come back to you 90% of the time. Sometimes you just have to be a little PATIENT and you'll save a fortune. Remember to always play up the SCARCITY. ""That's just too much for our budget... looks like we'll just go with an alternative name that we've been negotiating for a lot less, even though we preferred your name. Thanks for your time and at least trying to work something out."" That's NOT what they want to read from you. ;-)<p>There are THOUSANDS of amazing domain deals out there waiting to happen. I, personally, buy domains all the time this way. In fact, this is probably a good time to negotiate some deals as many people need the cash more than in recent years.<p>FINAL TIP: It's not uncommon to settle on a final price that is 30% of what their original asking price was. Keep that in mind as a general rule of thumb. I've had many deals for great names where someone ""really wanted $60,000"" and we closed the sale around $20K.",1329766978

Data plans were expensive and the speed of AT&Ts network at the time of original release was horrendous. These obstacles alone were enough to kill the iPhone. Dropping the price from $699 to $299 and now lower really drove the explosion in demand. The margins they made on the iPhone at this point, I imagine, would call your claim into question.<p>Additionally, the iPod was not a one dimensional device. Apple made its real money off of iTunes exclusivity. The first gen iPhone was an insanely expensive iPod at the time with the added cost of a data plan.

They both grow...""<p>There is such a thing as trivial replication, the trick is non-trivial replication. I dont have the background to give you the formal definition, but my laymans understanding is that non-trivial replication works from a description of a thing and a general-purpose factory that makes things from descriptions.<p>I think the formal definition says something about the information encoded in the thing that is replicating.<p>A fundamental questions mathematicians and computer scientists asked themselves in the first half of the 20th century was whether it was possible for a factory+description to be encoded in the description. 70 years later, we know the answer. but at that moment, it wasnt obvious how this could be done: If the factory required space F for itself and the description of the factory required space d(F), F+d(F) seemed to be larger than d(F), so the description of a factory plus the description of the description of a factory seems intuitively larger than the description of a factory, call it d(F+d(F)).<p>This seemed to go on ad infinitem, so how could you make a description such that when handed to the factory, the factory would make another factory AND copy the description so you would end up with a new factory plus a new description? Smart people figured out how to do this theoretically with things like the lambda calculus.<p>John von Neumann was interested in self-replciating robots. Stanislaw Ulam had been working with CAs and suggested von Neumann try buildinga  self-replicating CA on these lines, and von Neumann showed this could be done with a 29-state CA. This led to John Horton Conways radical simplification that we call Life today, and it has been both proven and demonstrated that Life is a universal computing machine. You can build self-replciating patterns that have encoded descriptions, universal Turing machines, hexadecimal calculators, and just about everything else.<p>Some of the most amusing oddities actually output numbers and letters organized as dots as if printed by a dot matrix printer!<p>Warning: Life is addictive but unremunerative.",1329765843

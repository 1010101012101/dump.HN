I've wanted to do this for a while and finally have the funds, so here I am.\n\n  I know how hard it can be to work on your dream project while you're trying to keep a steady income, and I'm hoping that there's a provider reading this job description with a great idea that we can work on together.\n\n  Before I get into the details, I'm not here to rip off anybody's idea. I'm an honest, ambitious person that's putting out a feeler for a strong partnership with someone that's equally honest and hardworking. I'm happy to sign any non-disclosure agreement you send my way (after reading it over thoroughly, of course).\n\n  So with that being said, I need details. I need to know how long your project is going to take, what it is, and how much you're going to need to stay funded without taking any freelance jobs (you'll need to be 100% focused and committed to this project).\n\n  In order to qualify to bid on this job, please:\n\n  -Be an honest person\n  -Be motivated, ambitious, and want to work for yourself and change your life\n  -Have a decent amount of feedback (and have a very good reputation)\n  -Be able to provide references\n\n  When you explain the idea, please provide:\n\n  -Tell me a bit about yourself and why you want to partner together\n  -An explanation of your idea\n  -Tell me what makes this project special\n  -Explain how the site makes money\n  -A description of the competition\n  -An idea of the overall income potential as the site grows\n\n  To let you know a little about me: As I said, I've done a lot of work on Elance over the years. I have an advertising/marketing background as well as a lot of experience marketing on the internet. I've been an affiliate marketer for years and am hoping to fund this project by myself, but if the idea is big enough and it's necessary I have the connections to get a lot more funding together.\n\n  Sot that's it! I'm looking for more than an idea - I'm looking for a partner. You have to be honest, extremely hardworking and wanting to change your life. It doesn't matter what part of the country you're in as long as you're honest, hardworking, and have a great idea.\n\n  Go ahead and bid on this job with the price it will cost me to fund you while you develop this project (the money you need as well as the expenses we will incur for possible servers, design, etc...). I'll be able to help pull other contractors together if necessary too. You can post as much detail as you're comfortable being displayed publicly with your bid, and private message me anything else.\n  \n  I look forward to hearing from you!</code></pre>",1363960739

As such its value should be stable on the micro (day to day) level. Slow decrease in value over time ensures that it is not a very attractive store of value, meaning that cash is invested, recirculated and used rather than simply hoarded.<p>Additionally, a central bank can (and should) act to stabilise the value further. When there are financial crises there are a variety of powers that can be used by a central bank to try and mitigate problems that could be exacerbated in a currency without this feature. Having a central bank with a variety of monetary powers is therefore a positive.<p>With a fixed supply and an ever-increasing value, bitcoin discourages any investment (why bother with risk? I'm getting richer just sitting here). More than this it massively rewards people who have bitcoin over those just coming into the game, using the economic output of those that are actually productive (be they workers, business owners, entrepreneurs, whoever) to enrich those that just sit idly on a hoard of coins.<p>This is why I think the fundamental parameters of the Bitcoin currency are unsuitable for large-scale or society-wide deployment.",1363959893

Listen to the can bounce as it falls down those stairs and that is exactly what Chinese sounds like. [...] TING TONG KLING KLANG...""</i><p>Hey, that's not true.  Hitting an empty soup can in various ways, you basically hear an explosive sound with each collision, then a ringing as the can resonates, then the ringing fades.  Hitting it along the sides, the ringing could be loosely interpreted as an ""ii"" vowel, but it also seems to be like ""ah-ee-uh"" if I listen closely.  Hitting it on the bottom, the vowel analogue of the ringing sound is decidedly ""uh"".<p>It is only by linguistic convention that this sound is transcribed for English speakers as ""ting"" or ""bang"".  That actually makes some sense, because those words begin with an explosive consonant and have a single vowel followed by ""ng"", which can be compared to an approximately-pure ringing fading out.  Still, there is definitely no ""n"" or ""ng"" sound from the can; I'd transcribe some of the sounds as ""tuh"" and ""baeyuh"".  A human saying ""ting"" sounds very different from the can.  I think there are beatboxers who could make a much better approximation, and I suspect a language with different sounds (some languages have click sounds, for example) would transcribe it differently.  (Offhand, does anyone happen to know how other languages transcribe various sounds?  Bang, ding, thud, hiss, gulp, crash?)<p>If he wanted to make that point, he should have said, ""Roll a tin can down the stairs, then ask an English speaker to tell you what it sounded like, and listen to the sounds the English speaker makes.""

Page breaks are ok.\nGUI apps are about controls/forms, lists, tables, trees, to interact with a backend - in short, they're about ""functionality"". Page breaks in a GUI app are disruptive and are therefore avoided.<p>HTML guys hate latency, they're used to the most direct effects. OO guys usually don't mind to invest time before coming up with effects.\nHTML guys often shy away from learning a new programming language; it's important that they can apply the same skill set over and over again. OO guys don't mind to learn a new language, but don't like to miss out on paradigms and patterns they value.<p>Cappuccion would be in the upper right quadrant (OO Programmer / GUI App), while e.g. jQuery would be in the lower left ( HTML/CSS/JS background / Web Page). Probably, the crowd behind the HTML/CSS/JS profile is larger than the OO programmer crowd. And the amount of effort spent on web pages with spiced-up appearance is larger than that of carefully crafted rich internet clients.<p>But probably both have their relevance, so why trash one in favor of the other?! For someone advertising on the web a slick appearance is prime, while a vendor of set top-boxes values reliability of their web-based configuration GUI.

Which means, sometimes I will generalise a response rather than using a status code in one place and one place only.<p>I'm not so sure on using verbs for special actions like search, 'q' is a well understood part of the 'query string', and I'd make that just an optional parameter on the pluralised collection URL.

5422614,comment,5419071,5421605,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"White: a layoff for a legitimate business reason (termination for convenience). Firing people who break the law or do things that are unethical (termination for cause). Firing people who fall short of a <i>published and objective</i> performance standard, if the policy is enforced uniformly. These are all considered to be unambiguously legal and ethical cases of termination.<p>Black: firing those who intend to unionize, firing with discriminatory intent, retaliation (including against protected insubordination such as whistleblowing), firing people because of disabilities that can be reasonably accommodated, firing people because they disclose compensation (anti-unionbusting provision), firing people for making legitimate use of HR or internal-mobility processes (a subcase of retaliation), firing people in retaliation for opposing harassment.<p>Gray: firing people who fail socially (when there's a record, in the company, of allowing internal transfer), firing people for ethically justifiable (but not explicitly protected) insubordination, firing people whose health issues interfere with the job, firing people you don't like.<p>In the US, most Gray cases are <i>not</i> considered tortious. You're correct. The burden of proof is technically on the employee to prove that it's a Black case.<p>If he knows what he's doing, however, the employee can establish enough Gray-Blackness that the company will desire to settle.<p>Typical firing example: Bob doesn't get along with his boss, Mark, who suspects Bob would rather be on another team. Mark gives him shitty performance reviews and he's flushed out. Looks like a non-tortious Gray case; the performance assessments are inherently subjective, but there's nothing about this that entitles Bob to legal protection. Even an inaccurate performance review is non-tortious managerial incompetence, right? Well, it's not that clear. For one thing, most companies make performance reviews part of the transfer packet. Then, a negative review can be construed as harassment: <i>interference with work performance</i>. Part of the employee's job is to cultivate internal relationships and that makes it harder.<p>Let's say that the performance review happened on February 1, with Bob being fired on March 15. Bob establishes that, in fact, he met with Alice (manager of another team) on January 24. Bob was, in fact, discussing internal mobility. He has a chain of emails to prove what was discussed.<p>That's not an uncommon thing for people to do when they don't get along with a boss, nor is it uncommon for bosses to pre-emptively fire flight risks. Now, Bob has a legitimate case for <i>retaliation</i>. He was making legitimate use of internal mobility processes and trying to build relationships within the company, which can reasonably be considered part of his job description, and he was punished for it with a negative review.<p>If, as is typical, his performance reviews are part of the transfer packet, his negative performance review constitutes <i>harassment</i> insofar as it interferes (tortiously) with his relationship with Alice.<p>Bob's claim is much stronger, <i>if</i> he has the paper. If he emailed himself (because, after being fired, he's lost access to his work account) copies of the relevant documentation, he has enough paper to initiate a discovery process. Even that, most companies would prefer to avoid.",1363957230

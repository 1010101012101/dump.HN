(which is the coolest thing to be in front of but I guess there must be already some algorithm application to handle this case)\n2) Why? Could you give some examples? I ask because I also think that rating-less like is dependent on the subjects personality. For me a dislike button should be much more meaningful because as a optimistic there is a bigger range of things I like with a bigger variation of likeness, while when I (would) hit dislike I must be pretty sure that I don't like it.\n3) I agree but the implication is that sites should use negative qualifications differently, it shouldn't be shared with others in the same way the likeness is shared unless, as in your suggestions, they enable you to find better content.

Rational scientists and laypeople must be open-minded...but we all gotta have a quack-filter too.<p>It's pretty funny to attack science on its strengths like that.<p>It gets better: <i>Some liberal  politicians have extrapolated the theory of relativity to metaphorically justify their own political agendas. For example, Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama helped publish an article by liberal law professor Laurence Tribe to apply the relativistic concept of ""curvature of space"" to promote a broad legal right to abortion.</i><p>Reading the original text which they are referring just saddens me, Conservapedia is taking issue with a metaphor describing layers of complexity in the nature of subjugation of women:<p>Laurence H. Tribe: <i>""The Roe v. Wade opinion ignored the way in which laws regulating pregnant women may shape the entire pattern of relationships among men, women, and children. It conceptualized abortion not in terms of the intensely public question of the subordination of women to men through the exploitation of pregnancy, but in terms of the purportedly private question of how women might make intimately personal decisions about their bodies and their lives. That vision described a part of the truth, but only what might be called the Newtonian part. ... [A] change in the surrounding legal setting can constitute state action that most threatens the sphere of personal choice. And it is a 'curved space' perspective on how law operates that leads one to focus less on the visible lines of legal force and more on how those lines are bent and directed by the law's geometry.""</i><p>I find it ironic and sad that both the science metaphor that they don't like and the woman's rights topic it addresses are both issues the religious right has an extremely poor track record accepting, even today, 2010. If someone disagrees that pregnancy and childcare have historically made the sexes unequal then perhaps they should say so and back it up (good luck) instead of freak out about a metaphor.<p><a href=""http://conservapedia.com/Theory_of_relativity#Lack_of_evidence_for_Relativity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conservapedia.com/Theory_of_relativity#Lack_of_eviden...</a>",1281766783

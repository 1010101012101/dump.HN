201337,comment,200670,201009,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've written system administration tools in both Perl and Python.  Perl is the better tool for the job (Ruby might be better still, once Unicode and performance are straightened out).<p>My Python code always ended up being significantly longer <i>and</i> slower than the same task written in Perl.  Partly due to CPAN (if you can imagine it, there's at least three libraries for it in CPAN), and partly due to the nature of Perl.  Perl is like a DSL built for system administration.  Sometimes it gets a little clumsy on non-system administration related tasks, but when you're working in Perl's sweet spot of functionality, it's a very nice experience.<p>That said, Perl can be intimidating, because it is such a wide ranging language, and some of its features aren't quite right (references, and the way lists and arrays behave, can be confusing, and they're still a source of confusion for me after years of working with Perl).  Python has its own quirks, and though I spent a couple of years working almost exclusively in Python, I didn't find it at all painful to come back to Perl.<p>Ruby, on the other hand, is a language that could probably steal my heart.  Between deciding to shutdown my old company and starting up Virtualmin, I was undecided on what to do with myself.  I learned some Ruby and tinkered with Ruby on Rails.  Loved Ruby instantly.  RoR, not as much.",1211918251

201334,comment,200797,200845,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"see this is the problem I have with progressives.  Your entire paradigm relies on collectivism.  No, the government shouldn't take my money and decide how to spend it ""for the good of the people"".  People should decide for themselves and the market will be forced to reflect people's real desires rather than some artificial notion of ""good"".  Who are you to decide what's good for me?<p>Gasoline isn't a problem.  Eventually supply will be constricted and demand will slow down.  It's not going to be The Grapes of Wrath overnight, we'll be forced to gradually move to more efficient transportation.  Economics trumps feel good social programs.",1211917550

201326,comment,201014,201319,0,0,thorax,,,"Yeah, ""motivation crowding"" is an interesting problem. I think the lightness of TJ helps that a bit, and for our site, it's an opt-in process so they have to be that sort of person if they want that.<p>I think you see more confusion in the revenue-sharing models. When you bill it as ""We'll pay you for content!"" then it really puts people into a mindset of $$$ which can effect how much they want to contribute in their spare time.<p>I think there's a good chance that won't happen in this model when you say ""Hey, you can let people tip you a dime for this content if you want.""<p>Still, I'm interested to see how well our community enjoys it.",1211916629

Cf: Google Answers vs. Yahoo Answers, among others.<p>The real challenge, I suspect, is creating a cultural expectation that certain kinds of online content/service <i>should</i> be supported by casual tipping.

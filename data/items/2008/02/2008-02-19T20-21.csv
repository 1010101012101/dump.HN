We cannot definitively say one thing or another, which is why I'm asking ANYBODY from a.viary.com to show the YC.News community something substantial.<p>For example: send an invite to somebody of high reputation at Digg/reddit/YC.News and have them spread the word.  This is a simple strategy that not only will help a.viary.com but will also lend tremendous credibility to their development efforts, not to mention future potential.<p>I think the best example of my cynicism is tagsy.com:<p><a href=""http://tagsy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tagsy.com</a><p>vs.<p><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/*/tagsy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/*/tagsy.com</a><p>Notice any similarities with streamy.com and the old tagsy.com?  I'm willing to bet streamy.com is total vaporware.  They've had enough time to get beta testers and lend some credibility to the notion that they are not vaporware; especially given the fact that the Streamy demo on YouTube looked like a finished product!  I have not seen the Aviary demo (where I work blocks YouTube), but I'm willing to bet that it looks like they've got something on the verge of being released (or in other words it is as impressive/polished as Streamy's demo on YouTube).",1203454184

No one can really deny the power of celebrity endorsements. Now what can be questioned, though, is just how many connections do you need before you can be considered an influential, and what magnitude is their influence? From Watt's experiment we can probably conclude that 40 is not enough to do a lot.",1203453944

I totally missed that paragraph when I read it the first time -- I thought they were only reporting numbers for the ""middle income"" folks.<p>I'm actually amazed that the number is that high -- I figured that even the ""menial"" jobs would have to pay more than that in that region.

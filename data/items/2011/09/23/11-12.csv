Recent research [1][2] suggests that ""normal"" Go program spends more time collecting garbage than performing actual calculations.<p>[1] <a href=""https://days2011.scala-lang.org/sites/days2011/files/ws3-1-Hundt.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://days2011.scala-lang.org/sites/days2011/files/ws3-1-H...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/07/01/go_v_cpluplus_redux/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/07/01/go_v_cpluplus_redux/</a><p>Go programming language has gone too far to separate owning and non-owning pointers at syntactic level, to disallow changeable global variables, to enforce rules like ""each mutable object is accessible from <i>only one</i> thread"", and introduce other means to avoid GC.<p>But Rust is new and young, already has 2 types of pointers, and it could avoid GC by RAII and reference counting. Objects linked in cycles with owning pointers would cause memory leaks, and I think this behaviour may be left as is, kinda ""it's not a bug, it's a feature"". Weak pointers could point to intermediary descriptor which holds owning-refcount and nonowning-refcount. Weak ptr behaves like a NULL if owning-refcount is zero and target object is already destroyed. This is to guarantee safe memory model.<p>In short please take all means to avoid main Go defect ""Garbage collection takes more CPU time than actual computations"". Please avoid stop-the-world GC approach which makes the language almost useless for real applications.",1316777613

They may or may not need funding. So there's no right or wrong answer - only what is best for what you want to create.<p>Once you have an idea of what size company you want to create and any timeframes you are arbitrarily placing on yourself, then ask what you will do with funding to achieve that? Do you need $100,000 to achieve that? Or $1,000,000? Or $10,000? There's little sense in raising more money than you intend to invest (with the possible exception of a buffer for unforseen blow outs) - that's just selling part of your company at a lower valuation than it will achieve in the future.<p>Good luck!",1316775969

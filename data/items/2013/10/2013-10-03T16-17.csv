It&#x27;s not that 75% tax hurts many people. The only thing it really does is propagating france image as a country that treats capitalism, investment and private initiative with the highest dose of suspicion. Thats nit a society thats enetrprenually friendly. It&#x27;s almost funny how many french i know that prefer to do art and fashion in new york than paris just because france would penalize them for being succesful.

If you are single and willing to live with roommates, you will be able to navigate the &quot;high cost of living&quot; pretty successfully.<p>I&#x27;m living quite comfortably in San Francisco and spending a <i>fraction</i> of what I was spending in Texas.  Why?<p>- No car. No gas. No upkeep. No payments. No insurance. No inspections. No car.<p>- Roommates. I HATE living alone so this was a no-brainer. If you insist on having your own place, then yeah it&#x27;s probably going to sting. If not you can often find good deals.<p>- Food. A tech job often provides free or free-ish food. Plus I can get reasonably-priced staples at the market on the corner of my block. The culture here makes it much less likely I&#x27;ll spend $400/mo at Olive Garden, Chili&#x27;s, and The Red Lobster.<p>- Stuff. Don&#x27;t need much. When I was in Texas I lived FAR away from anyone who really shared my geeky interests. I&#x27;m surrounded by them here. I simply don&#x27;t have the urge to buy so much stuff to keep me occupied. I have the stuff I need and I spend most of my time doing things with people. These things are often free. Speaking of which...<p>- &quot;funcheap&quot;. SF is famous for this (as is NYC). You can ALWAYS find cool stuff to do that costs little or no money. You can also, of course, find stuff that costs a lot of money. It&#x27;s your choice, day by day.<p>Now if I couldn&#x27;t stand to live with roommates or had a family to support, this would be a whole different story. Also, &quot;high cost of living&quot; really means $$$/sq ft vs $$/sq ft. It IS outrageous in places, but I&#x27;m much happier in my apartment with 1 bedroom to myself than I was in a 2600 square foot house in Texas. So yes, price per square foot is going to hurt on paper, but if &quot;size doesn&#x27;t matter&quot;, you might end up paying less by <i>actual dollars</i>.<p>Your mileage may vary, of course, but I&#x27;m pretty passionate about this since I stuck around in places that weren&#x27;t right for me a lot longer than I should have... simply because I let popular rhetoric convince me that only dot com millionaires could afford to live in the Bay Area.

Then there&#x27;s also the remaining double-row headers, which I&#x27;d assume are arranged on a 0.1&quot; spacing in relation to each other, and are possibly a new Arduino standard for a 3.3V-only header layout.<p>It&#x27;s still not perfect, though. Personally I wish they had made the new standard headers closer together than the old headers instead of further apart, to make it possible to at least bridge across some of them with a $10 5x5cm PCB (even the existing Arduino header standard is just a bit too large to fit on a 5x5cm board, and that&#x27;s the standard lowest-price tier at all of the super cheap chinese PCB services). But I guess if you only need access to the Uno-era Arduino pins, you can now fit everything into a ~4.4cm long double header. But it&#x27;s a double header, so you can&#x27;t make your &#x27;shield&#x27; able to pull double duty by plugging directly into a breadboard, which you could have if there had been two close rows of 5V headers instead of a single double-row.<p>But it is an improvement, and the form factor does have a history of working, a single double-row header is the basis for the entire Pi-Crust/Plate/Shield ecosystem.<p>High-resolution photos at <a href=""http://e2e.ti.com/blogs_/b/toolsinsider/archive/2013/10/03/introducing-arduino-tre.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://e2e.ti.com/blogs_/b/toolsinsider/archive/2013/10/03/i...</a>",1380819068

2) Lots of potential clients will be eligible for premium subsidies.<p>The net effect is that exchange-listed plans -- because of the two forms of subsidy -- have lower per member acquisition costs than traditional individual plans, meaning that for any given premium level, they can provide more profit and/or more coverage. These plans can expect to lose lots of their existing customers to exchange plans in the short-term, and its not really worth the effort to replace them -- so, for the insurer, it makes sense (especially since if they are also <i>offering</i> exchange listed plans) to just cancel the no-longer-viable non-exchange individual plans rather than continue to bear the fixed overhead of operating them when their sales prospects aren&#x27;t good.",1380818740

Mechanical Turk certainly CAN be abused, but it also CAN be used ethically. For example, we regularly use MT to complete tasks that pay workers effective hourly wages in the range of $8-20 per hour, and I know several other requesters who pay similarly.<p>It is probably most accurate to say that the lack of worker safeguards on MT attracts many users who pay rates that are (IMHO correctly) classified as abusive. Part of the issue with MT is that traditional worker protections like a minimum wage no longer make sense when you have compensation that is paid on a per-task rather than per-hour basis. Under a per-task compensatory system, faster workers will always earn more money (on an hourly basis) than slower workers. For the tasks we do, it is not uncommon for subsets of workers to earn effective hourly rates almost three times as high as others. In many ways this is good - incenting workers to spend their time on tasks that they can complete most effeciently (and away from tasks that they are less suited for) helps promote the most efficient allocation of labor resources.<p>But how do you ensure that all workers will always be treated fairly when a minimum wage no longer makes sense?  What do you replace it with? Its not clear that there is a simple replacement that works in the micro-tasking context.<p>Our platform (<a href=""http://houdiniapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://houdiniapp.com</a>) helps businesses complete projects on MTurk.  One of the things we realized is that many requesters pay low wages simply because they are really bad at estimating how long tasks actually take to complete.  Weve been able to solve this (somewhat) by providing tools that provide real-time feedback on average completion times in order to provide direct visibility into real hourly wages.  However we allow users to set their own compensation and some users still end up paying effective wages in the $2-3 (which we do not encourage, but don&#x27;t have any simple way to prevent).",1380818194

I know that there&#x27;s a search bar, but it&#x27;s not what users will see first. Why am I being given an alphabetic listing of cars? You may want to allow users to drill down further by car types, make the search more prominent, and if you have to provide a list of cars, order them by what you think the user will be likely to look at, instead of an alphabetic listing. At the very least, group them by manufacturer.<p>- Once you pick a car, the information is very sparse. Some pictures, some info about mileage, cost, and then an affiliate link to Edmunds.<p>The amount of information you get about a car after all that trouble is not even close to what car buyers are looking for. In the end, the only way to do research is to follow the link to Edmunds, so this entire website feels like a way to get affiliate revenue.

Well the market won&#x27;t bear that. So we have this tipping system set up.

There&#x27;s too much on the line to just leave this work to unpaid volunteers. But a real security department, for many reasons, is simply unfeasible. Real security has to audit everything. Too much manpower is needed. Bug bounties allow websites to get the security updates they need while compensating researchers somewhat adequately.<p>It&#x27;s not entitlement to believe that you should get an appropriate payment for your research.

So it most likely then becomes a race to the top, which once again will benefit the party with the larger war chest up until all assets are used up.<p>A set percentage of assets would feel better in my opinion, though in extreme cases it would probably still be a pretty penny.",1380816681

It would let you save custom builds of vehicles, each potentially from a completely different vendor, so you could review and compare side-by-side your own custom builds, with pictures, packages, pricing, etc., all arranged in ways that are conducive to comparison. It would be great if you could simply share URLs with friends so they can see exactly what you&#x27;re considering and give you feedback. Popular builds could be saved publicly and ranked and discussed by the site&#x27;s community and more.<p>That is what I would personally envision as a sort of revolutionary tool in this space, but there&#x27;s probably a reason it doesn&#x27;t exist. It would be pretty hard to maintain a custom build & price tool that generalizes basically all the custom ones out there--and to then keep it up to date at that.",1380816045

But I really don&#x27;t see the point in a service like this, at least not personally.<p>There&#x27;s three main issues I have with it:<p>1. Why should I let some random company I don&#x27;t know or trust keep my savings for me? I would assume you&#x27;re not a actual bank, so should you go bankrupt there&#x27;s no government insurance that&#x27;d ensure I don&#x27;t loose my money. And not saying you would, but from my point of view, what&#x27;s there to stop you from taking the money and run?<p>2. A charge of 3%. So to save 100 I&#x27;d loose 3. If I was saving for a Retina MBP of around 2,500 I&#x27;d lose 75.<p>3. Interest. Ok, sure, banks pay pretty horrible interest, but still, I&#x27;m loosing out of money I would otherwise have gotten. I saw your response about working on providing interest somehow in the future, but I&#x27;m focusing on the now here :)<p>When you add it all up, the increased risk of losing all the savings, combined with the loss of money in the 3% charge and lack of interest, personally I really see no point in using your service compared to my bank&#x27;s savings account.<p>And ok, it&#x27;s easy to move money out of my savings account, but it&#x27;s supposedly easy moving it out your service too. If you were to change that, there might just possibly be some point to it compared to a savings account. Except then you&#x27;re treading on dangerous legal and/or moral ground if you deny people access to their money, even if they&#x27;ve previously agreed to the terms.<p>On a final note, I believe the only valuable feature you have to offer is the fact that friends can chip in. If I were you, I&#x27;d focus on that feature instead of holding people&#x27;s cash. Let people set up some kinda campaign page for their new phone/laptop purchase and let family and friends chip in, wiring the money back to the user, rather than you holding on to it. Think of it like a personalized kickstarter mashed with amazon wishlists or something.<p><rant>Let little Jimmy Neutron setup a campaign for his wish to get an Xbox One. He&#x27;s got 200 cash already, which the campaign reflects, then he sends the campaign page to his grand parents, uncles, aunts, etc, and maybe they&#x27;ll chip in enough so he can get his new console.</rant>",1380816008

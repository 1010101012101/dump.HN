When you do that, and read a book on it ( i like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Editor-Nutshell-Linda-Lamb/dp/0937175676"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Editor-Nutshell-Linda-Lamb/dp...</a> ) then it comes together and you start to really feel like a maestro.",1237628532

You can buy multi-region players or remove the region lock with a code on certain players, but the mainstream are R2 only. Which is a pain.<p>Indeed, simple region flipping on a PC could have seen Brown sitting down with Citizen Kane (or whatever other 'American classics') quite happily...",1237628086

One of the few consumer oriented regulations that has had a real impact upon such outdated and outmoded restrictions.",1237627699

But you will notice a huge difference in the reaction of someone who learns you went to Berkeley than if they learned you went to SF State or Irvine. Doesn't mean those schools are bad, people are just biased.<p>A Computer Science degree is kind of a benchmark. It's really what <i>you do</i> that matters. If you make a significant contribution to the linux kernel, you could have gone to community college and astute employers would still be impressed. Or you could distinguish yourself by publishing research papers as an undergraduate.<p>When it comes down to it, though, if you are just looking to get a job then experience is the key. Getting internship<i>s</i> programming in popular languages is a good idea. There is a list on the web somewhere that contains languages used by employers in percentages.",1237627658

If you were married or have a kid together that is a different story. But if she's not even your girlfriend anymore, then definitely no. There are plenty of fish in the sea.<p>While grad schools do put some emphasis on the school you graduate from, the most important thing (I'm assuming you're talking about a PhD) is showing you can do good research and getting good recommendations by your professors. Getting decent grades probably wouldn't hurt either.<p>As far as getting a job is concerned, it really depends on what you want to do. If you want to go work in consulting or at an investment bank, then yeah, the school is very important and going to a good school will open a lot of doors. If you want to work at a startup, being able to get things done is much more important.",1237626498

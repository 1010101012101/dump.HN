E.g. if you have your own system you can allow to match your funds. So instead of $20k you can get additional $80k from other investors. Likely it will be regulatory nightmare... but maybe there is some legal workaround.",1439276899

The pitch also causes one foot to underpronate and one to overpronate which is also usually a bad idea.<p>Most of peoples&#x27; issues relate to bad form, muscle imbalances, etc. Although I will grant if your form is terrible you are probably going to put weird stresses on your knees, etc. I blame our incredibly sedentary lifestyle. I sit probably 60+ hours a week (job, commute, home, etc.) and run only about 4 hours a week (~30 miles). I have been racing and running for close to 25 years and most of my current issues came from very hard training in the past and not taking time off when I got injured. When I just run 4 to 6 miles &quot;easy&quot; I am basically injury free as long as I supplement with a few other exercises such as single leg partial squats and monster walks with a rubber band. These are mostly only required because of my sedentary job and not the running though.",1439276858

Sauron and the Orcs are objectively evil, and you can kill as many orcs as you want without feeling any remorse. Sarumans industrialization is pure evil. Aragorn is the rightfully ruler purely by virtue of being a &quot;good guy&quot; and having the right ancestors.<p>Now compare to Princess Mononoke. Obviously the corruption of the nature is an evil thing, but Eboshi is not &quot;evil&quot;, she saves the outcasts of society, lepers and prostitutes and gives them life and dignity, but as part of her plan she upsets the balance of nature. This is much more complex conflict as in Tolkien, and the solution is not as easy, since you cannot just kill all the bad guys.",1439276523

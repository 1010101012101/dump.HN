Why do you need to make a decision when you&#x27;ve reached the current block--can&#x27;t that decision wait until you&#x27;ve seen more data or been told there is no more data?<p>--<p>...I can see that if you&#x27;re using bit vectors to represent active states, that&#x27;s how you can make use of SSE4/string instructions and POPCNT... I&#x27;ve been thinking about how to do that but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work with a VM implementation. Maybe for a hybrid filtration scheme, though...<p>--<p>Have you implemented Watson&#x27;s MultiRE with input skipping, or Wu-Manber? I&#x27;ve tried some hacky approaches to skipping before and the problem seems to be that a sufficiently large pattern set will always include a short pattern (e.g., &quot;PE&quot;) and now you&#x27;re stuck with a bad l-min.<p>--<p>Ordering is horrible, both between patterns and within patterns (Perl&#x27;s ordered alternation rules). It took us a couple years to get full compatibility with PCRE (for forensics, correctness is more important than line speed searching; and most of our input comes from spinning rust, not ephemeral packets). We had to sacrifice the strict guarantee on O(M)/static memory usage during searching in order to gain full compatibility. Fortunately, branch prediction and reserving memory remove pretty much remove that cost, so that with normal pattern sets we don&#x27;t see mallocs.<p>Streaming matching is criminally understudied from a theoretical perspective. You cannot match some patterns in O(M) memory in a streaming model as an NFA algorithm should. The one we know about is any time a lower priority path is a prefix for a higher priority prefix; you have to buffer the lower priority match until the high priority match resolves. E.g., &quot;a+b|a&quot; on a string of a&#x27;s is pathological. These kinds of patterns can be detected; what I don&#x27;t know is whether there are other classes (I don&#x27;t think so, <i>but</i>...).<p>--<p>I&#x27;ve always found the DPI use case fascinating, as it is a completely different input model than what I&#x27;ve worked on, which has its own rules, and yet has many of the same demanding theoretical requirements in its treatment of automata.",1445395483

They are scared of radiation, therefore allow for lots of unnecessary deaths, destruction of the environment <i>and</i> even more radiation by refusing to replace coal plants with nuclear ones. They&#x27;re also afraid of vaccines, microwaves and cell-phone EM radiation (how they were never afraid of radio waves in pre-cellphone era is beyond me, but maybe they initially were but got over it).<p>That people are afraid of things that aren&#x27;t dangerous doesn&#x27;t mean we should stop doing that things. As for how to make people not afraid, I don&#x27;t know anymore. Maybe we should just pay the advertising industry to fix that with propaganda?",1445395454

That is, our NFAs are just bitvectors over states, not threads that can hold their own SoM or information about prior quantifiers. &quot;NFA&quot; has suffered a bit of semantic drift over the years...<p>We&#x27;ve heard of redgrep. I think there&#x27;s a role for JITs here but I&#x27;m not sure I buy the concept that it should be a straightforward &quot;turn the DFA states into code and jump around&quot;.<p>Predicting the future: if we have a regular expression made up of R1, R2 and Q (where R1, R2 are regexes and Q is a quantified something-or-rather - NOT necessarily with Q and R2 disjoint!) as follows /(R1)(Q)+(R2)/ and we&#x27;re in streaming mode, &#x27;predicting the future&#x27; means that we need to understand what happens beyond a stream boundary to know what to do now. Supposing that we have a stream boundary falling between something matching both (Q)+ and (R2) what is <i>going to happen</i> to future matches of R2.<p>This can be done but is hard - the problems are very similar to SoM tracking in a traditional NFA or DFA, and mean that you are starting to track loads of extra state.<p>The other problem for us with trying to support lazy/greedy quantification is ordering. We might have another regex (in a multiple regex set) that is unambiguously meant to throw a match between two potential matches controlled by something we might need to hold on to until we see whether the equivalent of (R2) matches for the second instance. So we can&#x27;t just fire and forget if we go the quantifier-support route.<p>The fact is that the client base in network apps is very familiar with &#x27;automata semantics&#x27; (i.e. lazy/greedy is a no-op and you get all matches) and supporting anything beyond that is a lot more expensive to get right.<p>Yes, there&#x27;s something a <i>bit</i> peculiar about the idea of capturing and streaming mode together, isn&#x27;t there? &quot;Oh, we have the offsets of what matched, but you threw the data away, sorry&quot;.<p>Bounded repetition is a huge pain and is a work in progress for us in the general case. Single-character-wide bounded repetition (e.g. \s{100} or .{80,120} etc) works quite well. Depending on the form of the bounded repeat and the context, it is sometimes be possible to replace the repeat by tracking either the location of first or last entry, but the general case is horrible: /a.{20000}b/s is just as bad as it looks. We actually do this, but you better have 20,000 bits handy per stream state. :-)",1445393778

The fact that building simple CRUD apps can be done quickly, reliably, and efficiently without the need to be on the cutting-edge of JavaScript wizardry is amazing, but it also means that you probably won&#x27;t hear about it on Hacker News because it&#x27;s not what &quot;hackers&quot; (in this case I mean people who like to experiment with new technologies) are getting into.<p>The only reason why this is becoming more of a &quot;thing&quot; nowadays, at least on blogs and in the media, is because the idea of creating a web application that actually <i>does</i> stuff entirely with JavaScript is a relatively new idea, at least in practice on a grand scale. As a job, many web developers (myself included) use JavaScript only when absolutely necessary, and it&#x27;s really just to make things &quot;look nice&quot;. At work, JavaScript is not the thing that drives our entire application (in fact we have more than a few tests that ensure our apps&#x27; critical functions work even when JavaScript is disabled in the browser). But I&#x27;ve been experimenting with Ember, Electron, et. al., and it&#x27;s pretty cool what you can do nowadays with JS alone. These new toolchains have brought and will continue to allow entirely new genres of web applications to be developed with ease, meaning my job gets a little more interesting. We&#x27;ll probably always have/need CRUD apps, but as a web developer, your fate is no longer sealed in writing CRUD apps for the rest of your life. That&#x27;s pretty neat!",1445392844

5611069,comment,5609613,5610761,3,0,lsd5you,,,"I think this misses the point.<p>Grouping ANT/Maven together because of XML is a very superficial association to make. ANT despite what it claims is essentially an inflexible programming language, which offers very few benefits over java (and many disadvantages), except that it is interpreted (not compiled), has a library of build tasks and can be stuck in the root of a project without looking like source code. XML is a big issue in ant because it is a very poor choice for writing a programming language.<p>Maven is a build framework, into which you make your program fit, by decomposing it into maven projects ... etc. etc. XML is a perfectly good choice for configuration here. The core problem with Maven is poor design. For one, it has tried to make things simpler than they are, and does not recognise that some programming projects are fundamentally not amenable to a module structure (i.e. what ebuild calls products). It also makes developing across the dependency boundary (i.e. your program + the library) very cumbersome indeed.",1366941343

The reason I blame the Reddit users who were involved in initially accusing him is because they were very aware that the news media could, and likely would, report on their speculation.  Early on in the /r/findbostonbombers subreddit rules were posted that specifically addressed the media.  One of the rules stated was to not report on the speculation because it was just that.

This is a shortcut that people automatically use to make judgments about things based on their overall impression of those things. It is responsible for a ton of glitches in people's perception.<p>For example, if you tell people that a nuclear reactor is particularly safe (in terms of meltdowns), they will tend to assume that it also generates less waste.",1366938854

I don't want it in the browser either. However, I don't understand how it is a red herring. Everything that is being proposed in EME is already possible in Flash and Silverlight, and those features only exist in those plugins for the same reason. Neither of them need file encryption in order to work as a platform - it is a feature so that people that want to have encrypted/licensed material on the internet can do so.

Now I will definitely look elsewhere. One problem is that FB APIs have a tendency to be constantly changing, and the documentation is not good. This shifting sands is not a good place to build a service.<p>However, the biggest reason is that FB is NOT a back end service provider.  Facebook's customer is the advertisers. Before getting bought, Parse's customer were the companies that used their service. Now Parse is part of FB so future directions will all be in service of FB's main customer, the advertisers.  I have no problem with this from a business standpoint, I am sure it is a good move for FB, but as a customer of back end cloud services I want to be purchasing that service from a company that puts me first.  FB will not do that.<p>TL;DR: I was Parse's customer, I am not Facebook's customer.",1366938603

It was recommended by a Pomodoro program I use called Tomate[0] which defaults to a minimum 10 minute timer instead of 25 minutes:<p>> The rationale is that the hardest part of working is getting at it. Past the first ten minutes, continuing to work is far easier. So you only have to commit to the first ten minutes, your motivation should do the rest.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://gitorious.org/tomate/pages/Home"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gitorious.org/tomate/pages/Home</a>",1418637501
8751289,comment,8750309,8751211,0,0,lingoberry,,,"No, I didn&#x27;t mean it takes months to get your loan approved for most people. It did for us though, since we moved from abroad, having no work history in Sweden and no jobs at that point. That means you have to get two job offers first (for a couple) and that takes time. During this time you are looking at apartments but can&#x27;t bid since you haven&#x27;t secured a loan. Then comes the looking part, which for us took maybe 2 months. There was a lull in availability (and extreme competition between bidders), and we were outbid for everything. When we finally found one, and outbid another couple (price rose 700SEK btw), we had to wait another 3 months to move in.<p>Everybody&#x27;s experience is different, but I think we can agree this is madness and not good for our economy. I rarely have much positive to say about the US, but one thing is that you can literally go to almost any city (except maybe SF and NYC), live in a hotel, and within a week you have found some place to live. Might not be the highest standard of living, but you can always trade up.",1418637454

How about those over the hill all the way over at 7/8ths through?  The guy who has only done this procedure twice before, shall we have him work only on the mentally deficient who don&#x27;t know any better?<p>By definition we cannot all have the best surgeon (and there is one).  Therefore you can only ration access to this &quot;best&quot; surgeon in one of three ways: need, luck, or money.  Personally I&#x27;d rank them in that order in terms of sense - and none of them <i>truly</i> involve patient choice.<p>Metrics are great for use internally, as oversight.

8751285,comment,8749647,8751084,0,0,ggreer,,,"That&#x27;s not true. We know enough about ecosystems to assess the importance of various organisms. For example, biologists say the 30-or-so malaria-bearing mosquito species can be eliminated without causing trouble.[1] Doing this would save at least 1,000,000 lives (mostly children) and tens of billions of dollars per year. Like the American Chestnut, these mosquitos are massive populations that serve important roles in nature. Yet killing them would not cause problems for their ecosystems, let alone humanity. Our dependence on nature is not so great, and our knowledge of nature is not so small. A single species so obscure as to be unknown to us simply cannot be crucial to humanity&#x27;s survival.<p>With the story of the American Chestnut and the biologists&#x27; assessments of mosquitos, I hope I&#x27;ve presented some convincing evidence that lack of biodiversity is not an existential threat. Is it a loss? Assuming genomes aren&#x27;t sequenced, yes. But the same is true for the destruction of old books. While regrettable, I don&#x27;t lose much sleep over either.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_control#Proposals_to_eradicate_mosquitos"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_control#Proposals_to_e...</a>",1418637387

Both processes and compartments shield JavaScript objects against each other.<p>The most important distinction is that processes offer a stronger separation enforced by the processor hardware, while compartments offer a pure software guarantee. However, on the upside compartments allow much more efficient cross compartment communication that processes code.<p>With compartments cross origin websites can still communicate with each other with a small overhead (governed by certain cross origin access policy), while with processes cross-process JavaScript object access is either impossible or extremely expensive.<p>In a modern browser you will likely see both forms of separation being applied. Two web sites that never have to talk to each other can live in separate processes, while cross origin websites that do want to communicate can use compartments to enhance security and performance.&quot;<p>You can read more about how that works at <a href=""http://andreasgal.com/2010/10/13/compartments/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://andreasgal.com/2010/10/13/compartments/</a>",1418636486

This isn&#x27;t Stack Overflow, you aren&#x27;t educating beginners, and even then there is no need to come to the comments with an axe to grind.<p>The compiler is not a magical fairy that optimises away the cost of memory allocation.

You use them because you have a bunch of fixed size allocations all with the same lifetime, and - <i>after profiling</i> - you need to exploit that fact.<p>There will be unsafe code outside of Vec because you need to do four things:<p>- allocate a chunk of memory (for non-relocatable objects) \n- construct objects in portions of the memory of that chunk \n- destruct objects in each chunk\n- deallocate the chunks of memory<p>If Rust ever gets placement box we can do the whole thing safely, but IIRC there hasn&#x27;t been a decision made nor any experimental implementation.

8751210,comment,8749518,8749518,0,0,joshuak,,,"Do not write a spell checker like this!  I will hunt you down and beat you with a dictionary.<p>I find spell checking in almost every application that I&#x27;ve tried to be spectacularly bad for anything other than trivial typos.  Google is quite good, but it is leveraging data not always available in other applications and is a special case optimized for search applications.  Spell correcting for general writing is somewhat different in requirements and optimization vectors.<p>Spelling errors that can be classified in terms of edit distance, are far better characterized as &quot;typos&quot; not spelling errors. A typo is a transcription error, whereas incorrect spelling is a representation error. Both can be present in a particular ward, but they are different phenomenon.<p>People make incorrect spelling choices when they <i>intentionally</i> chose the wrong letters to represent phonemes, or to apply spelling rules incorrectly.<p>A better approach in all respects is to do what&#x27;s often referred to as a grapheme to phoneme transformation, which is basically to `compile` a word in to a smaller set of characters representing the phonemes of the language.  With the reduced set of symbols, that in and of themselves eliminate trivial typos, statistical models can preform better, and faster.  Further, unknown words can often be corrected via the corrected spelling of the phoneme.<p>Why most spelling checkers fail to do grapheme to phoneme transformation when it is easy and both reduces the symbol set for statistical analysis and is demonstrably more accurate (with the possible exception of Indian languages) is beyond me.

I could also do some actual shopping, with considerable tolerance from the vendors, no doubt, but without anything other than Bulgarian and good will.<p>We had a formal dinner at the end, and as the Rear Admiral came down the line shaking hands I said ""Blagodarya"" (can't write Cyrillic) and he stopped dead in his tracks.

Sure, he might be arrogant and he might spam search engines..but let me ask you this, if you could ""spam search engines"" and get away with it all while profiting, would you do it? You would be an idiot not to. This might be an unpopular response, but you know deep down it's the truth.<p>Now I actually watched the video, and I admit that it's inspirational. He speaks many truths and through the duration of the video he mostly concentrates on his failures, and to me that's an invaluable resource. This has NOTHING to do with emulating anyone, in fact he points out at the end that you should not copy anyone and suggests you should lead and by leading you will find your successes in life. Fairly redundant material, but reiterating it from time to time helps.<p>As for him being two face, and arrogant..again, unfounded. You don't know the guy, do you? Judging someone via hearsay and via the internet is not cool.<p>As for the video, its worth the watch if you have the time.",1266052174

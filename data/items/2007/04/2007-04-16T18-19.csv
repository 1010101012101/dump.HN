While achieving a critical mass might be impossible (read unlikely and hard to control) if you try for the world as a whole, it may be possible for a smaller one.  Once you have a small group that is largely converted you can add other groups in such a way that you don't put out the fire by separating members of the first group.  <p>It may be that a large part of the success of Facebook comes from the way they were able to use student bodies as small, self-contained networks, and then build from there.<p>It reminds me of building a fire with charcoals.  If you keep them together you can keep them burning.  If you can get a nice group going you can add to it bit by bit and build as big as you want.  If you disperse them they die.<p>Our world has a million little self-contained networks.  If you try to win some over perhaps some will succeed to the point that the network works for you.  Then maybe you can add others.

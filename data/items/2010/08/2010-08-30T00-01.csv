- The design of the site is fantastic. I can safely say I've never seen
a site that looks as well, both in terms of artwork, appearance,
navigation etc. I did spot one or two usability glitches and spelling
mistakes... I am a bit anal when it comes to that, but I'm sure you know
that already!
- The concept and ideas are also excellent: the semantic engine; a Q&A
market; seamless integration with other sites. This kind of research
tool/experts network should be in very high demand, if it catches on.
From what I can see, the biggest challenge will be attracting enough of
a user-base to get the ball rolling. I think you need to explain to
users exactly what differentiates beepl from your competitors, like
Yahoo answers... for example on the ""About Beepl"" page, or maybe by
putting an article up on Wikipedia about beepl before the launch.
- I can't comment on how viable it is in terms of revenue, but I'm sure
you have the business model worked out already!<p>That's all I can think of off the top of my head. Hope it's useful. I'd

Mozart's music seems to have convinced Einstein that whatever theory ultimately successfully described the cosmos would have to have a grace, succinctness, and beauty that corresponded to the grace, succinctness, and beauty of Mozart. In the case of Einstein, as I am sure you are aware, this worked to his advantage and against it; for it when he discarded superfluous ad hoc physical constructions such as the luminiferous ether in favor of c's constancy, and of course against it when he constructed the cosmological constant to satisfy his intuition that the universe was eternally static. You can say that his interpretation of Mozart's music as perfect, succinct, and eternal could have simply been a matter of his subjective feelings on the matter, and of course I would agree with you. However, I'm not sure that music's subjective nature necessarily negates its usefulness as a model for mathematical aesthetics. If Beethoven pleases me, I'll look for solutions that satisfy me in a similar fashion.

And when it looked like merb might possibly overtake rails I went ahead and gave merb to the rails project and got the two teams together so there wasn't wasted effort. After all to have ruby and rails itself win we needed to compete with java and python and php. Merb was starting to fragment the ruby community as it became a more and more viable option and I did some personal heavy politicking to get it merged back into rails so we could take on the world instead of infighting within the ruby community.<p>I think it's been a great success story and most of the ideas of merb's architecture have made it into rails.<p>So I'm incredibly happy to see rails 3 finally come out. And I'm incredibly happy that my little experiment in making rails architecture better has paid off and the two projects merged. But I do think it's a bit weak that merb was not mentioned once in the article.<p>(Edit) all this being said I don't want to come across as co plaining. My work on merb ended up exactly as I wanted it to, it made rails better.<p>So huge congratulations to the rails team for making this happen!<p>(Edit) <a href=""http://rubyonrails.org/merb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rubyonrails.org/merb</a>",1283128332

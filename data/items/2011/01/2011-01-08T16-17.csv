Just some weeks ago some girl I didn't know that happened to be the designated driver of the group of friends I was with on the new years eve sent me a friend request on facebook.<p>I don't want to be rude and accepted it, but she went to my list of people that I don't consider friends, but people that at some point in my life I had some interaction that as now ceased. That list doesn't have access to my photos, only some personal information and the majority of my status updates are invisible to them unless I explicitly set otherwise.<p>So yeah, they're my fake friends. If your friends list is already big setting this up and checking if there are no backdoors into your information will be painful, but I think it pays off. I did it mostly because I didn't want to bring the family and friends sides of my life together in a single website, with all the potential problems that could come from that, but I ended up creating more than just the friends and family lists.<p>Funny thing, right now Facebook privacy is more about protecting your information from your ""friends"" than from the outside world.",1294503653

Yes, a lot of writing gets lumped in as ""science fiction"" because it has space and robots and lasers, but you can look for science fiction as a genre. I define it as fiction that explores questions raised by developments in science and technology. ""Do Androids..."" was clearly sci-fi, dealing with questions about what it is to be human, but also about if we could create souls, etc. (As an aside, it's a direction of thought I really wish the new BSG would've focused more on, as opposed to mythology/political thriller)<p>William Gibson has been consistently good with writing what I describe as science fiction. So was Neal Stephenson (Cryptonomicon, Diamond Age, even the System of the World trilogy). Conversely, Star Wars would not be considered science fiction, just fantasy with spaceships.",1294503176

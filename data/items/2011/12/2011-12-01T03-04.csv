Pending patent applications sometimes can tell you a lot about where a company is heading.<p>Here are a couple of quotes from Carrier IQ's pending U.S. 20090207749	USER-INITIATED REPORTING OF MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM ERRORS:<p>""...This configuration enables the system 200 to dynamically generate and download to a population of wireless devices rule-based data collection profiles. Data collection profiles may be generated manually by a network administrator, a software developer or other personnel involved in the operation of the network (hereinafter referred to as ""network administrators""), created offline as a portion of a data analysis solution, or automatically generated based on network parameters or other events. Profiles define what information is to be collected on the devices in response to which conditions and events, as well as the conditions and events that cause the device to upload the collected information.<p>[0038] Conditions or events include any occurrence in the network or on the device that the device can sense, such as a call dropping or a user pressing a button on the device. Conditions and events also include the passage of time, or a request from a network administrator that the device report information back to the server. Conditions and events which cause a device to collect information or upload the collected information may generally be referred to as ""triggers."" ""<p>and:<p>""[0080] In the exemplary embodiment, triggers may be included in the data collection directives of a data collection profile, and their inclusion causes the client to initiate, abort, and terminate data collection activity as appropriate when the associated trigger condition is invoked by the wireless device 400. A trigger invocation that matches the initiating trigger causes data collection activity to begin. A match of the terminating trigger causes the data collection activity to end, and a metrics package is then prepared for uploading. An abort trigger causes data collection activity to cease, and a metrics package is not prepared or is not uploaded. In the example used earlier, launching an application caused the client to be invoked with an ""application launched"" trigger event, which is matched against triggers in downloaded profiles and causes data collection activity to begin on a user's device. The user's entering of a particular key sequence, pressing of a dedicated button, or selection of a particular menu option while the application is running would cause another trigger to be activated, and the SQC would match the event to a terminating trigger in the profile, cause data collection to stop and a metrics package to be prepared and uploaded. As can be seen, the inclusion of a trigger in a profile effectively selects the condition under which a specific action associated with that profile is to be executed. The trigger is not strictly within the profile, rather it associates specific profile actions (start, stop, abort) with a specific event on the device. ""<p>And the claims from their pending ""USING MOBILE DEVICE TO CREATE ACTIVITY RECORD"" application No. 20090210516 is quite interesting to browse:<p>1. In a communication system, a method for creating an activity record, the method comprising: recording data at a device, the data including one or more events and event-related data that describe activities of a user; uploading the data to a server, wherein the server organizes the data based the event related data; and generating an activity record using the data that can be presented to a user, wherein the activity record represents at least a partial log of the activities of the user.<p>2.

The method of claim 2, wherein generating an activity record using the data comprises creating an entry for each of the one or more events describing where and when an event occurred.<p>4. The method of claim 3, further comprising presenting the activity record on a website, wherein the website is accessed by the device or using another device.<p>5.

But I think they would happen a great deal <i>more</i> when the market is bigger and more legitimate (legitimate from the POV of the purchaser).<p>> Would it be morally preferable to only allow people who aren't ""economically oppressed"" to sell their bone marrow?<p>It's more morally preferable if only those who sold their organs didn't need the money (ie, they are doing it from the goodness of their hearts, not because they were screwed by some societal systems and are down on their luck), but less morally preferable if you actually had to enforce it (which would require selectively enforcing a law based on your perception of someone's intentions).<p>As I think about it more though, I'm leaning more towards: Let them sell their body parts, it's their body, their choice.

That's my point.  HN isn't an island.  I've seen quite a few people who disable comments on their blog posts and explicitly direct readers to the corresponding post here for discussion.  The real damage to real reputations is being done elsewhere, and condemning those who point it out here seems counterproductive.<p>""I don't think you can talk about ""de-escalation""""<p>Ad hominem, pure and simple.

3298108,comment,3288013,3288013,1,0,peterselj,,,"Hi guys - author (Josh) here.<p>Thanks for reading and commenting. Even the negative stuff is appreciated. I thought I'd leave you a quick response.<p>First, I'm thrilled that you thought to do a brief background check, and found me. I can offer some explanation to some of the conclusions you've drawn based on the article and otherwise.<p>The most important note that I think gets lost in translation: In its original form (appearing in Harvard Business School's newspaper), the piece is a satire. Specifically, it's a response to a series of events that painted a particularly gushy and fuzzy picture of entrepreneurship. As many of you were quick to point out the holes in an article that was blatantly and exclusively negative, I had merely been acting likewise to the opposite prompt. Also, lamentably, much of the piece's humor had to be edited out for the broader internet audience (unless you suspect you'd appreciate quips about the eccentricities of HBS's staff & curriculum). In the given context, and even in the broader context, much of your criticism is certainly valid.<p>endtwist- I think ""trolling"" is a bit harsh, but yes, the goal is to provoke a discussion. Mission accomplished? I'm happy to hear that some mutual friend has vouched for me. And yes, given a broader scope and bigger word count, the art of delegating would certainly have been investigated at length.<p>jpdoctor- I understand your point. No, I've never worked in a union shop (sorry!). My argument was that, in some strange, perverse way, having such a burden lifted (as in your union shop illustration) is a nicety compared to the stresses of ultimate responsibility. But again, I can see why this might not be the case.<p>bdrocco- Yep. You're right.<p>MJR, brownie- Yep, you found me. Sorry about the typo- publishing the article on RWW was done through a third party. Though I can't claim to be a venerable authority with decades of experience, I hope my credentials (and brief explanation above) can add a little more worth to the piece.<p>tluyben2- I don't think I failed as an entrepreneur. And I most definitely tried. (I suppose the edited version of the article's second doesn't really make this clear, but I did continue to work full time after graduating from undergrad.) Without a doubt you make more money, have more free time, etc. etc. than I do - do bear in mind that I'm currently a student. That all said: much like you, I was in love with what I did, and look forward to re-entering the entrepreneurship field some day in the future. Thanks for commenting.<p>GFisher- Sorry for baiting you. But yeah, you're absolutely right.<p>rdl, chr15- technically I wasn't a 2+2, though most of the structure is accurate. As for ""accomplishing nothing,"" I suppose it depends on your definition of accomplishment. And again, the article doesn't totally make it clear that I ran my company full-time, expanded operations cross-country, and exited via sale in the two years between now and my time in undergrad. Not your typical consulting background, but I think HBS likes to bring in a few strange people for diversity.<p>bodegajed- I'm with you 100%.<p>moocow01- I'm with you 115%.<p>Everyone else- thanks, too.<p>Cheers.",1322708583

If parameter names are identical, there's less to maintain; I like using a single underscore ""_"" for all header-file parameters.<p>Here's an example of a method that has lots of parameters, where the parameter names are kind of pointless:<p><pre><code>  @interface UIView : . . .

If only software patents really <i>were</i> what they're supposed to be.<p>I wish patents were a celebration of inventiveness, as they are in other fields, instead of often obvious and consequentially hated in ours. Inventiveness is the highest ideal of our field; and patents, really, <i>should</i> be about that.<p>A secondary problem is that the description isn't intelligible to him - who invented prior art for it. One of the requirements of a patent is that someone skilled in the art is able to construct the invention. If the originator of slashdot, who is cited as prior art isn't ""skilled in the art"", who is? Software patents have truly lost their way.",1322708432

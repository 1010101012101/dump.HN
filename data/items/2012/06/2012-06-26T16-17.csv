4162867,comment,4161610,4162109,4,0,notJim,,,"I learned ST2 from my coworkers, who were all using it. Now I'm learning vim much the same way. I've switched to vim fulltime from ST2, and here are the features of ST2 that I miss:<p>1. Multiple cursors. This is the only reason I ever use ST2 now. They're sort of like vim's visual block mode, except on steroids. For example, if you have multiple cursors, you can start typing and each cursor will behave as in insert point. Each cursor can also move independently, which means you can do things like moving word-wise or line-wise over lines which are not heterogeneous. Using Cmd + D, you can add selections, and then they're multiple cursors. This ends up replacing things like find-replace for me, because it's so fast and easy.<p>I should make a video of me using multiple cursors, because I feel I'm not explaining it well at all.<p>2. Cmd+p/goto-anything. Suppose I want to go to the getUser method of the auth class. All I have to do is hit Cmd + p, then type Au@getUser. As I type, a window appears with filenames, so first I type, Au, and then seeing that Auth.php is at the top, I type an @, which tells ST2 I'm now looking for a method, it then starts searching for methods within Auth.php.<p>Now, with vim I use Cmd-T, but that only gets me to the file, and it's kind of a bitch to get it working. It also has a thing to navigate methods, but I have to use something called tags, which means a) I have to figure out what the hell that is and b) I have to fiddle with getting it all setup. All that time could be spent programming. Mmmm, programming. I understand ctrlp makes some of this better, but I haven't tried it yet.<p>3. Better platform integration. With vim, there's a bunch of weird shit I have to do to get the clipboard working properly (including recompiling vim o_O), and the mouse seems janky. I mostly never use the mouse anyway, but the clipboard issues are annoying.<p>4. Python API vs vimscript. I wrote a couple of small plugins for ST2, which was nice and easy, because everybody knows python, and the API is modern and well thought out. With vim, I feel like it's a whole different matter, starting with learning a new programming language.",1340729471

4162865,comment,4162211,4162717,8,0,jiggy2011,,,"I wouldn't say ""hate"" programming, people who hate programming tend to write the worst overcomplicated code because their idea of re-use is copy-pasting the same bit of code they found online into every place they think it will fit and changing it around in various ways in different places so it becomes very hard to abstract later. They also like to stick with the same set of now deprecated APIs they learned 10+ years ago which means that it becomes hard to take advantage of newer libraries which were not built with these in mind, meaning that you will do a lot of wheel re-invention or shimming. They tend to think of economizing on effort and brain usage <i>right now</i> rather than economizing on technical debt in the long run.<p>There is also sometimes a trade off between saving time for the programmer and saving time for others. For example a manager might want a feature that saves them 10 minutes of time once a month when they want to produce a particular report but may cost programmers several hours a month just keeping this feature up to date. In this case it comes down to who's time is more valuable.<p>The best way to explain this to people is in terms of ""tax"" (since everyone hates that). I was once asked by a management type ""I used to get all my changes turned around same day, now I seem to wait weeks or even months. What's going on?""<p>Of course the simple answer to this question is that a year ago the program was about 10Kloc , now it's more like 200Kloc. It's also much more ""mission critical"" than it was. A year ago the program was small enough that I could easily imagine all the consequences of making a change in my brain so I could do basic testing and push to production, now a small change can have many consequences so it has to be thoroughly tested first.<p>So the analogy to make would be the government building infrastructure for say the road network. The upfront cost of building is $x , but when doing that you commit to $y spending per year (in terms of cost+time) to keeping that going.<p>Persuading people not to add functionality they don't need is a good idea of course, but this isn't always going to be practical. 
Firstly it assumes that the developer understands every aspect of the business well enough to evaluate this, in which case they really may as well just put the developer in charge of the whole thing.<p>It's also partly a political issue, I've spent months adding features to codebases that I know for a fact are not required because somebody with enough influence simply insists that it will be important. There is only a certain level of argument you can get into before you get to ""do as you are told"", that level will of course depend on many non-technical factors.<p>Another interesting point is that I find sometimes people will request feature X because they are perusing a line of though that will eventually lead them to conclude that they actually need feature Y. In many cases feature Y may be easier to implement (or maintain) than feature X but they simply haven't reasoned that far ahead yet so will insist that they want feature X now but acknowledge that they may change to feature Y a few months down the line.",1340729437

Is this something that needs to be improved there, or are you happy with that being one of the built-in anchors?<p>Additionally, I'm not sure that the implementation of the hard reliable case sounds very mature or even well thought-out.  Having a syncer running at 20hz and waiting for it even in the synchronous path seems a bad idea.  That's kind of like adding an anchor to your anchor so your speedboat can crawl while it crawls.  Or was that a misrepresentation?<p>And who cares if the tone is serious?  The criticisms seem to be valid, and ones that anyone releasing software making bold claims should expect.  Statements about performance need to be qualified.  Out-of-the-box behavior is not a reasonable point of comparison if (1) that's not what people do in the real world (2) the tests you use are ones that one piece of software is tuned for and the other is tuned against.  Some kind of sorted index by field is necessary for some very common and desirable queries.  Some of the performance gains come at an unacknowledged cost.  The durability just isn't there (and for trivial reasons that could be fixed by making a few more parameters tunable, it sounds like), but is implicitly lauded by claiming to be ACID.<p>I don't know if you need to go looking for praise in that article.  It really seems like there are some criticisms it would be beneficial to take seriously, even if you object to the author's tone or lack of praise.

If smart people can make gobs of money in other fields (never mind why, the important thing is that they <i>can</i>), why should we be surprised that they won't become programmers for 80K a year?",1340728613

The editor has a project system where you just add whichever directories you care about, which is simple but effective for many jobs.<p>As an IDE replacement, I don't think the combination of available packages is even close to sufficient yet. If you want to start looking at things like code navigation, code completion, refactoring, and integration with external tools for build/test/analysis/source control, you need a bit more flexibility than the default project system. The catch is that for this kind of tool, it has to be done so that it plays nicely with arbitrary plug-ins in arbitrary languages, and without descending into the kind of abomination that is configuring a project in most IDEs.<p>That's a very tough problem to solve well. If you work on projects using multiple programming languages, I'm not sure anyone has actually solved it yet. But for single languages, IDEs do a lot more than what ST2's default project system can support, and if anyone has built a plug-in that gets anywhere near what I think would be necessary, I've never found it so far.",1340727560

4162659,comment,4161664,4161664,3,0,einhverfr,,,"I think the hate comes from two sides:<p>1)  Relational folks who feel that ORMs don't really enable good relational design, and<p>2)  OO folks who feel that ORM's cause a lot of headache regarding relational to operation data structure conversion.<p>The folks in camp 1 are usually absolutely right.  Most ORMs encourage the developer to design the database around the ORM which has to be an antipattern when it comes to relational systems.  This isn't always the case.  DBIx::Class has done some awesome work on some things like composite primary keys and the like.  But generally in most cases it is true.<p>On the OO side I am less convinced of the costs.  So my complaints come from the relational side.  Yes object to operational data structure mapping is <i>hard</i> to automate, and it's even harder to automate well.  So maybe we shouldn't try.  Maybe ORM's should be disregarded in favor of ways of designing the data so that abstractions occur at different points.<p>In the LedgerSMB project we decided to use stored procedures to accomplish this abstraction.  We don't put ""all the logic"" in the database, far from it.  But database operations go through the stored procedures, and these are often well tuned for performance (or as well tuned as they can be).  The stored procedures thus create an API for addressing relational data, and this allows an abstraction layer to be formed which maps these into object methods.  We'll probably extend this further in the future to tie object properties to complex database types, but we haven't decided the best way to do this yet.<p>ORMs get a lot of hate because they tackle a very difficult problem and consequently tend to produce results that are unsatisfactory particularly to db folks.  They are the product of app designers looking at the db, more often than not, rather than db designers looking at the app.",1340727100

I want it to be clear my comment wasn't a personal attack) is that I use a strong password that would not be easily crackable by dumb bruteforce or rainbow tables.  Therefore even if an attacker breaks in to a service that I use, steals database tables containing hashed and salted passwords and gets cracking, the likelihood that he/she breaks MY password is relatively low.  Now the minimal effort from the company providing the service went to great length to complement MY effort of choosing a strong password.<p>There are a lot of problems in security.  Weak passwords and password reuse are the burden of the user.  Correct storing of passwords and preventing intrusions are the burden of the developer.  Neither of those are an excuse for skipping hashing and salting because ""it can be broken easily"".  You mention 12 months yourself, I'm sure my bcrypt'd/salted 16 character non-dictionary word unique password would discourage any cracker (and take more than 12 months to crack) and all of that was a lot easier to set up than a dedicated password storage solution.<p>Point is, do whatever you can to protect data.

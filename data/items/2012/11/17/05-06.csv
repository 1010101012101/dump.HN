4797364,comment,4796456,4796730,3,0,misterjangles,,,"Nobody really says ""here is a task I am delegating to you.""  Delegation sounds more like ""I need this by Friday"" or ""How long will XYZ take?""  or ""Let's put this task on the top of your priority list.""<p>Learning to delegate tasks is a tricky hurdle to get past if you start to get into management.  For one you have to get over the guilt of assigning other people tasks.  You just can't be a good manager if you don't learn to delegate.  There's also a weird thing when you are too nice and timid about assigning tasks then it tends to create problems due to, I guess, lack of respect for the boss.  If you're pretty confident and no-nonsense about it then people don't seem to question it.  It's a weird thing.  Assuming of course you're being reasonable, aware and considerate about people's abilities and workload.",1353131771

That statement is a major disconnect from reality.<p>I also think that there are many service out there that are buying into this 'high pricing' doctrine and are giving prospective customers sticker shock. These starving young companies can't afford to do that so early in the game.<p>The other day I saw a site on HN selling business ebooks to startups: ""how to drive more traffic to your website"" $99, a customer segmentation ebook for $39, a copywriting ebook for $49. All this stuff is way overpriced. Dozens of quality articles can be googled up in a few minutes for the same information. I know because I did just that.<p>The people that tell these young startups to jack their prices are not being helpful or even honest. Maybe its a way of trying to justify their own high pricing.<p>I suggest young startups get users <i>by any means possible</i>, even if it means discounting heavily. They need habitual users, and that requires making it affordable enough that the enduser uses the tool / service for a long enough time that it becomes a habit and the tool becomes too entrenched in their workflow.<p>If anything is rude, it's telling young startups how to price their businesses when it looks like they don't have a clue on pricing even their own.",1353130737

Rudy Guiliani, for the most part. Ron Paul has been, in most policy dimensions. When Romney was running for MA Senate and then elected as Governor, he was pretty socially tolerant, as well. And before him, another Massachusetts GOP governor, William Weld. Chris Christie isn't a socially-conservative crusader, and a number of the other GOP governors/senators are more pragmatic than anything else.<p>It's always been there; it just needs a stronger hand versus the deeply socially conservative elements. However, as more issues have ""nationalized"" the parties have homogenized somewhat, with Dems successfully tarnishing even socially-tolerant Republicans as if they were the same as faraway hardcore religious conservatives, and liberal Republicans peeling away (as with Lincoln Chafee in RI and Charlie Crist in FL).<p>I suspect the national parties (or perhaps mainly the GOP) will have to devolve into more than 2 brands for healthy regional competitiveness. While our system has a bias at every level towards 2-big-coalitions, having only two harmonized national brands doesn't offer sufficient competitive diversity.

4797296,comment,4796289,4797176,8,0,rayiner,,,"> This is simply false. Pollution would be treated as a tort. Now, you can't set up a home near an already existing, noisy club and complain about noise pollution. If you set up a home in a quiet and unpolluted area, you have a right to maintain the structural integrity of that area.<p>Let's analyze this situation with some economic rigor. What you're invoking is Coase's theorem. The idea that if you create property rights in what would otherwise be externalities, and let people transact freely in those property rights, the end result will be an optimal allocation of rights that maximizes value.<p>Now, I'll get to the punchline before going further in depth. It's deeply ironic that libertarians invoke Coase's theorem in this context, because Coase himself used smoke pollution as an example of a situation that called for regulation rather than the creation of property rights.<p>You see, there is an important assumption underlying Coase's theorem: transaction costs are zero. But in the environmental context, transaction costs are not zero, and in fact they totally dominate the relevant transactions. A polluting coal plant might cause $1,000 of health damage to each of 100,000 people, and it isn't worth any of their whiles to litigate such injuries. Yet the cumulative impact of such activity is large--the coal plant is essentially ""stealing"" $100m, but getting away with it by stealing a little from a lot of people at once.<p>Multiply that by the hundreds and thousands of pollution sources that have a measurable impact on each person, and what you get is an unworkable system. And Coase himself recognized this and said as much in his papers.",1353129538

It was small arms and man-portable weapons like mortars and MANPADs.<p>And while those armies did eventually get arms supplies from abroad, in their early days they had to improvise. Viet Cong fighters early in that war, for instance, had to scrounge old French weapons or even homemade shotguns fashioned from galvanized pipe. The Iraqis' first IEDs were jerry-rigged artillery shells lifted from abandoned army depots.

C++ doesn&#x27;t add constness by default anywhere (with the novel exception of lambda function call operators). If you give me a modifiable range, the least surprising thing to do is to give you a modifiable element, because that&#x27;s what all of ptr[idx], * ptr, and * iter would do.<p>> how realistic (from the impl. POV) would be to have value-semantic range-based `for` with _mandated_ copy elision whenever possible?<p>If you say &quot;for (auto elem : range) { elem = stuff; }&quot; the write to the elem-copy will be dropped on the floor. Copy elision can&#x27;t solve that.<p>> it doesn&#x27;t say that `it` _itself_ has to be immutable (right?)<p>Correct.<p>> How do you think about InputIterators?<p>The concept is single-pass, read-only, but a given iterator may be stronger. for_each() is kind of special (it&#x27;s the only algorithm that takes InputIterators, yet allows stronger iterators to be used with modifying functors), but other algorithms are vaguely similar. For example, transform(InIt first, InIt last, OutIt result, UnOp op) permits transform(first, last, first, op) for an in-place transformation - here, first/last&#x27;s type clearly has to be InIt and OutIt simultaneously, i.e. a mutable FwdIt iterator or stronger.",1406006964

It reminds me of the difficulty of teaching a one-semester course in Software Engineering: you need a large project before software engineering principles start to be needed; but developing a large project is more than semester&#x27;s work in itself...<p>I&#x27;m not sure there is an answer to this, for equational reasoning. It seems some tradeoff/sacrifice is needed; something must be given up. Maybe: only summarise the project and sketch out the proof (like those of professional mathematicians) - the tradeoff is that this is no longer elementary from first principles, and would be inaccessible to newcomers. Maybe a &quot;201&quot; blog post, that has as prerequisites some of your &quot;101&quot; blog posts?<p>There&#x27;s certainly a need to have an actual complex project to prove. Could be one of your own; building one specifically for this (so the complexity is not overwhelming; and minimize interactions); or choose some  existing complex project off the shelf. Probably needs to be an objectively convincingly complex one (so not one that is intrinsically tied to addressing problems within Haskell itself).

Begin working on bugs assigned in the tracker.  \n</code></pre>\n(Representative example: List of students assigned to a particular class has an off-by-one error resulting in there being one less student actually displayed in reports than the report says it contains.)<p><pre><code>  12:55: Three bugs done, good job.  Break for lunch.\n  1:30: Back from lunch.  Planning meeting for project Y\n  2:30: Meeting over.  Meet with trainee for scheduled professional development lesson.\n  3:00: First uncommitted time on the day.  Begin making progress on the quarterly objective.\n</code></pre>\n(Sample objective: ~20 new features in our proprietary framework. We have a custom tag which we use in our Big Freaking Enterprise Java apps which lets us turn POJO collections into tabular data, but let&#x27;s have it such that users can click on a particular row in the table and have that highlight the row, through the magic of Prototype.)  Nobody will ask me about this for another three weeks so I have to pick the pace, being mindful to tread the line between looking like I&#x27;m busy but not being so productive as to make more senior engineers look bad.<p><pre><code>  5:30 PM: Planning meeting.\n  7:00 PM: Meeting over, quick break for dinner.\n  7:15 PM: Eating dinner at desk.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m totally cashiered at this point but cannot socially speaking make a habit of going home this early.  Accordingly, I sit quietly at my desk and make a show of working diligently.  It is mostly for show.  Everyone around me knows it is for show, much like them checking that I am diligently working is for show.  These are <i>important</i> shows.<p><pre><code>  9:00 PM: Hit the first group of more senior salarymen going home.  Yay.  Almost done.\n  9:30 PM: Apologize for my early departure.\n</code></pre>\nNote that the above is <i>not</i> crunch time in a Japanese megacorp, as you can see by me arriving and departing on the same calendar day.<p>Here&#x27;s a day in the life of my consulting career:<p><pre><code>  8:00 AM: Inbox triage for my own businesses.\n  8:30 AM: Leave hotel.\n  9:00 AM: Arrive at office.  Get coffee/cereal.  Consume them while reading client-related email.\n  9:30 AM: Enough email for the moment.  Start working on Project Deliverable A.\n</code></pre>\nRepresentative example: complete redesign of the front page (low-fidelity mockup) plus 2,000 words of copy plus 10 suggestions for the H1.  These will be A/B tested against the existing front page.<p><pre><code>  10:00 AM: Meeting with stakeholders for Deliverable C.  Representative example: email content for a free one-month mini course which they&#x27;ll use to get more leads for the software.\n  11:00 AM: Back to working on A.\n  12:30 PM: Lunch, downstairs with team.\n  1:00 PM: Meeting with stakeholders for Deliverable B.  \n</code></pre>\nRepresentative example: Implement a first-run experience of the software to handhold users through getting their account set up and running.<p><pre><code>  2:00 PM: Tired of working on A. Investigate JS frameworks for B.\n  4:00 PM: JS framework chosen.  Write down in notes.  OK, back to A.\n  5:30 PM: Prep for tomorrow&#x27;s meetings, check email.\n  6:00 PM: Apologize for ducking out early. \n</code></pre>\nThere are still client team members working (and there will be until 7 PM or so in the evening, at least).  I have, however, to go to a dinner that I had scheduled for 6:30 PM.  (I <i>generally</i> work such hours as are standard and customary for clients.  At some clients this means I&#x27;m out of the office at 5 PM on the dot, at others it means a bit later.  If &quot;standard and customary&quot; means &quot;salaryman hours&quot; at your office then at around 6:30 or so I just leave quietly.)<p>And what do things look like when I&#x27;m working on my own business (where, n.b., all of the products involve substantial amounts of code that I wrote)?<p><pre><code>  7:00 AM: Wake up early for meeting.  It was canceled.\n  9:00 AM: Breakfast with wife.\n  9:30 AM: Catnap due to only having 6 hours of sleep.\n  12:00 PM: Up again.  Business administration (moving money).\n  2:00 PM: I should really be getting lunch now, but I&#x27;m on HN instead.\n  3:30 PM: Will probably be done with lunch.  Start working on essay.\n  6:00 PM: Probably done with essay, if the mood is right.\n</code></pre>\nIf not, I&#x27;d have task-switched to one of the other todos on my list.  Of the top ten exactly one involves programming and that is under 100 lines of code.<p><pre><code>  6:30 PM: Come home, play League of Legends a bit.\n  8:00 PM: Dinner with wife.\n  9:00 PM: Quick sweep of inbox for 20 minutes or so.</code></pre>",1406006289

I mostly program full time in Objective-C and work on a wide range of problems like image processing, audio, networked applications and more recently parsing, NLP and (non-game-related) AI.<p>1. Wake up around 8, start working around 9.<p>2. Respond to emails for ~30 minutes.<p>3. Program for 7.5 hours, usually having lunch while working.<p>4. Have dinner, spend time with family.<p>5. Possibly program for another 1-3 hours. The late night stuff might be a side project (or more likely) the most complex part of the current project I&#x27;m working on.<p>6. Rinse, repeat. Take weekends off and try to take a mental holiday to the largest extent possible (drink some craft beer, smoke some pot, play video games, go shopping, take the family somewhere, etc).<p>I get paid (relatively) large sums of money to solve (relatively) hard problems. The key to being successful in that is getting large blocks of uninterrupted time to work, and when the complexity of the problem warrants it, being able to get in a lot of extra time researching and trying out different things.<p>There is also some time getting on Skype with clients but I try to keep a steady stream of github activity / emails flowing their way so we don&#x27;t have to kill too much time talking about the work we&#x27;re doing. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t like to talk to people -- once I get started it&#x27;s hard to shut me up -- but I think meetings quickly become counterproductive.<p>I either work from home or from a local coffee shop. I have a (somewhat) high end headphone rig that gives me the privacy that I need. I drink coffee like water. I exercise a bit and try to eat as well / healthy as possible.<p>Dealing with burnout is a very real thing and I don&#x27;t think it matters how disciplined you are. I come from a corporate / entrepreneurial background which granted me a &quot;work before mental health&quot; work ethic. I take what I do very (maybe too) seriously. Still, I find it entirely possible to push myself too hard then find it nearly impossible to re-engage. It&#x27;s never the end of the world because I recover quickly (a couple days max) but it is something I have to be aware of. I often make breakthroughs burning the midnight oil but that comes at a cost.<p>Put another way, sometimes you feel like you could work through the night. Most of the time you shouldn&#x27;t. You need to find a balance between getting things done short term and getting things done long term. There&#x27;s definitely an art to it.<p>The life of a programmer will vary considerably based on what type of job they have of course but for me it&#x27;s like the life of a writer or a composer (though I don&#x27;t wow people at cocktail parties). I spend most of my time in mental solitude. I love what I do and it&#x27;s lucrative enough that people generally don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m insane for being as obsessed as I am.",1406005811

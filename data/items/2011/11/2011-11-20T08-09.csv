It's only popular among the arm-chair internet specialists on corporate governance. For a well-rounded perspective on the subject I would suggest the ""Corporations"" text book by Alan Palmiter.<p>In brief, a corporation's purpose is maintaining balance between interests of various stakeholders such as shareholders, employees, management, creditors, regulators, consumers, the public, etc. Each stakeholder is exerting a different kind of influence on the corporation and suffers different consequences from the resulting consensus action (which motivates his influence).",1321779548

This is a classic case of ""how can we make the customer do what we want"" instead of ""how do we make our customer's life better"".<p>Yeah, Google's profit is all in ads, so it wants you to spend as much time on the web and as little time on native apps as possible. Guess what Google: <i>your customers don't care about your bottom line</i>.<p>They want the best device, for the lowest price.<p>So here are our two contenders:<p>- A ""broken laptop"" that can't do everything the user wants it to do. It can only go on the web. It uses a strange OS that nobody is used to but yet does not seem to offer any benefits.<p>- A full-featured laptop/netbook that gets the same battery life (if not better), runs a common OS everyone is already familiar with, runs all of their apps (and the ones their friends are running too), <i>and does the web thing just as well</i>.<p>And checking out Chromebooks and Dell/HP netbooks... <i>They're even the same price</i>.<p>So here's Google, offering <i>substantially</i> less value for the customer's dollar, and people are standing around shocked that it's not working.<p>The core question here is: is this product better than what it seeks to replace. And the answer, IMO, is an <i>emphatic</i> no. It's missing many features people have come to expect from such devices, and for that it's not even cheaper.<p>Google needs to turn this upside down and work from the customers. At the end of the day, as long as you don't have a monopoly, the users do what <i>they</i> want, you cannot push a product that has a shitty value proposition and expect people to latch on.

(quite often for contract gigs at large companies, even if the decision maker knows you and wants you, there is still a body shop in the loop.)<p>The whole point of recruiters, job sites, and that whole industry is to try to move beyond ""It's who you know""  and while that is a laudable goal, I don't think they have made a whole heck of a lot of progress, in part due to the intangibles you describe, but eh, I think that communicating the intangibles about the employer to the potential employee has all the same problems of communicating the intangibles of the potential employee to the employer, and neither problem has been solved.",1321778431

If someone doesn't pursue their own interests then by logical necessity they are pursueing interests imposed on them. ""Social interest"" is merely a euphamism for State interests. Killing the Jews in gas chambers was a social interest. Of course, by disagreeing with that you would prove my point that ""social responsibility"" is anything but a completely subjective term that varies (greatly) by each individual, and only has power in the context of the State.<p><i>As a practical matter, only a few crazies actually believe that people have no social obligations.</i><p>But what does social obligation mean?

Once a class has been run, how much labor is required of Stanford staffers?<p>My concern is that Stanford will hold these classes, realize no payoffs besides goodwill, and then quit. It may sound strange, but it'd be comforting to know Stanford is materially benefiting from the classes. If they aren't, I worry they'll stop. I think I won't have time for <i>any</i> classes this semester, as I'm taking some for credit classes elsewhere.<p>To remedy that, I wonder if Stanford could offer tutoring services for pay, sort of like giving away software and then charging for support. This wouldn't be too different from the status quo where TAs teach undergrads who in turn subsidize graduate instruction. This might create an incentive for Stanford to make classes unnecessarily abstruse (by analogy, making software impossible to use without technical support), but if professors weren't pressured to hit revenue targets, I don't think it would be an issue.<p>The next step to truly revolutionize education is to grant credits and eventually complete degrees, while lining up employers who would accept these degrees and hire their holders.

3257598,comment,3252656,3254370,2,0,neilk,,,"Hi, I work at the WMF. I'll address your points here.<p>> Why cant we have Stypi recording all changes made to Wikipedia articles?<p>Because Stypi didn't exist until a few months ago?<p>Ok, more seriously: I and my colleagues have talked to everybody else that ever did collaborative editing tools. We know the Wave guys, the Etherpad guys, and others, over the past year. I myself did a little analysis of Stypi a little while ago to try to learn some things from them.<p>We are working on this problem. I think you will be pleasantly surprised with the results shortly. The new editing ""surface"" is making progress by leaps and bounds lately.<p>See <a href=""http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Future"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Future</a> and others.<p>There are reasons why we can't just grab anything off the shelf like Etherpad, Wave, Etherpad-lite, or Stypi. MediaWiki already has a huge infrastructure of tools behind it and the entire community model is organized around chronologically ordered single-user discrete taggable edits of a very specialized format. Wikipedia wouldn't work well without all the bots and scripts that our community has written, and then we'd have to rewrite all of <i>them</i> too.<p>Etherpad has plain text with bold and italic. Stypi has even less, as far as I know. It is possible to use these editors to create a collaborative way to edit wikitext (I did an experiment this summer to do just that). But that doesn't get us any closer to a GUI editor, which most people think is a sine qua non.<p>Given the resources we have devoted to this -- basically <i>some</i> of the time of four or five engineers since March or so -- progress has actually been pretty good. Anyway, that's a slice of life at the WMF. Just so you know, in my corner of the world at least, we really are trying to make things awesome and it isn't costing the world a whole lot.<p>> Why cant we create more engaging Wikipedia articles using
> something like Popcorn.js for videos?<p>Again it comes down to the wikitext format. We do not have the liberty of banging out a new JS library and content model and then slowly adding features.<p>Because the Foundation is adamant about never deploying any technology that's not 100% open source, we missed the whole wave of Flash-based video. Only in the past few years has it become possible to seriously do open source video in the browser. Michael Dale from Kaltura has written some great HTML5 video libraries for MediaWiki; watch for them on Wikipedia in the near future. In the meantime we're also upgrading our APIs and storage infrastructure to support uploading longer format videos and so on.<p>This brings us into parity with maybe Youtube circa 2007 or so, with some more advanced editing and annotating tools due to the wiki-nature of everything we do. But better late than never.",1321776785

""By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it."" The rhetoric we use today ""a rising tide lifts all boats"" and the like is thoroughly rooted in that thinking.<p>The fact of that matter is that we know this premise to be false. That knowledge is indeed irrelevant if you conceive of the profit-maximizing principle as being entirely rooted in an ""every man is an island"" hyper-libertarian conceptualization, but that is a relatively modern phenomenon and a wholly inaccurate description of the underpinnings of modern American ethics.<p>As a practical matter, only a few crazies actually believe that people have no social obligations. A large majority have some social conscience, but because they fully buy in to Smith's normative principle, they believe that their business decisions need not be guided by considerations other than profit. To the extent that this principle is invalid, their behavior is inconsistent with fostering desirable outcomes.",1321776394

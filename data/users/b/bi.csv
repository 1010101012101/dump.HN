The Bitcoin market moves exceptionally fast and for developers, that means that they don&#x27;t have time to integrate 20 different APIs from all over the net, let alone create accounts with all of them. Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if you could just integrate one cryptographically secure API, write one line of code, and receive the current market rates for every available coin on every popular cryptocurrency exchange?<p>Bit API Hub allows developers to write very little code, integrate a short one file SDK, and call any API anywhere in the world through our custom designed gateway service. Our system integrates hundreds of APIs so you can always get the data you need right from a single API. If we don&#x27;t have the API you&#x27;re looking for, you can write a custom API call to tell our server where to find it and how to use it.<p>We support JSON responses from API servers who use the most popular response types, JSON, XML, and SOAP. If your desired API speaks a different language, we have you covered. Simply request the response in your desired API&#x27;s native language.<p>Check out what we&#x27;re building at http://bitapihub.com!",1416428438,1429477163

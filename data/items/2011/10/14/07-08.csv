That is, a highly dynamic site that is NOT dependent on user logins.<p>1) If the site is only moderately dynamic, you can just use plain Nginx and set fastcgi_cache to a few minutes or hours. Much less load on the server. I like to keep things simple, I wouldn't even bother with Apache. Porting rewrites to Nginx is super simple.<p>2) If the site is customised on a per-user basis, 'microcaching' will break the site and have disastrous consequences. Every user will see the system customised for whichever user primed the cache.<p>My primary website is user based. That means this 'microcaching' concept wont work at all. It would be catastrophic.<p>That's where Varnish comes in with ESI. I really wish I didn't have to use Varnish. It's slower than Nginx, it adds another layer of complexity, and in testing, it seems slightly flaky. But what Varnish+ESI allows is caching of parts of my page that aren't user specific.

The component writer knows the needs of the component and can set the caching policy for it there.  Other developers can then just include the component without knowing what its needs are.  In a way, this means they don't have to design the page for caching.. they kinda get it for free.<p>2. There are several optimizations I can make using this method, and since it is intrinsic to the need to be able to run things in parallel (components have a clearly defined line between them another components) the caching ability is just a few extra lines of code and so relatively low cost for me to add.",1318576358

3110318,comment,3109283,3110171,12,0,gruseom,,,"That's a good enough question that you've provoked me into figuring out what I think about this.<p>Adding words takes up space. A downvote doesn't. Therefore a downvote is more lightweight, therefore there are times when it's more appropriate than a comment. It's an in-between gesture, partway between silence and verbalization. I like that subtlety. It's an especially good way to express disagreement with something one feels is not only wrong but also somehow debasing. A comment doesn't have to be rude to be debasing, it can just be mediocre or somehow crass, nor is one always able to say exactly how. Those are cases where fostering more discussion is unlikely to do good and it's better to hold one's tongue. But downvoting still gives a signal to the original commenter as well as to other readers that someone's not ok with what was said.  I think that's meaningful, and also that it's fairly rare to see people abusing that signal. It does happen, but more often when someone thinks they don't deserve it, it's kind of obvious to others that really they do. So when it happens, the best way to respond is with a touch of self-honesty. Maybe you'll come out roses but just maybe you'll notice something worth correcting.<p>One other thing about downvoting. I think what makes it controversial, and also interesting, is that it's an emotional expression. (Upvotes are too, but downvotes are stronger.) That explains why people get upset about it, have strong opinions and so on. But it also explains why it's a good thing to have around. There are very few emotional channels available to us that don't require proximity. It also explains why it's wrong to say that downvotes are inferior and should be replaced by comments. Imagine if people were forced to put every emotional gesture into words. It would be impossibly ponderous. And we'd end up talking about nothing else.",1318575886

One of the things I've been thinking about is having applications define a pipe, and then sending requests thru the pipe.  The pipe is inherently sequential, so it fits well with a sequential language like javascript (you'd just write fittings in the coffeescript/javascript and then at the app level define the pipeline as a series of fittings.)  On the other hand, this seems potentially less parallelizable and so I won't know which is more performant until I can run some tests (And I'm not yet to the point where I can do that.)<p>Anyway, reading the page you linked to now, will update this comment with what I learn from it.<p>EDIT TO ADD:\nHave read a good chunk of that page now.

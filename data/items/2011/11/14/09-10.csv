Currently my brew is broken and I can't upgrade anything until I figure out why some obscure Gnome lib isn't compiling... I have not had any sort of issue like that with Linux in the past 8 years when it comes to upgrading routiney used software.<p>OSX's command line utils are BSD style... so going between OSX and Linux shells, I often end up with messages such as 'ls: -l: No such file or directory' because I expected to be able to put flags anywhere in the arguments.<p>Even between the vaunted Mac editors such as TextMate and Coda, I haven't found a text editor I like as much as Kate.<p>There are various other issues I've struggled with, mainly relating to installing and upgrading open source software. Projects simply expect that you will be using Linux, and using this proprietary BSD offshoot is simply inconvenient due to it's usual *nix differences.<p>Also, my own preferences and habits come into play. I like KDE, Gnome, WindowMaker... being able to press ctrl-alt-Fkey and get a fullscreen terminal...

And if the designers are careless things get obsolete really quickly; I know a design that used a Bourns resistor network with a 1% tolerance.  This package was once offered by Bourns, but the standard was 2% tolerance, and the 1% part was rare and thus very expensive.

Your customers/readers in the midst of trying to solve some problem at 2AM, and/or under the watchful eye of the CTO/CEO, and/or in a colo's hot or cold aisle with fans blaring and a melted-down stack, aren't going to tolerate your Yoyodyne Tron-a-matic Blipvert Flux Capacitor Mark 5-1000[tm] descriptions line after line.  It's ""it"", ""the device"", or some other simple pronoun or generic phrase.<p>2: You're writing to solve a problem, to accomplish a goal. Figure out what the problem and goal are. If you don't know, get an engineer who designed the product, or more likely, a solid sales engineer who uses it and encounters customers who know the ups and downs, to straighten you out. Actually, they're the ones who're probably best off writing the docs (they probably already have), and you as a technical writer should squeeze this into your publishing system and verify correctness of the information.<p>3: Descriptions of features shouldn't mirror the text or name of a feature, but <i>explain their purpose or function</i>. The quantity of proprietary/commercial documentation which falls down on this point is staggering.<p>4: Document significant product bugs and failings, clearly. This is a necessary corrolary of the first principle above. The ""BUGS"" section of UNIX manpages were (and are) revolutionary.<p>5: The bulk of the style guidelines in the ""Technical Writing Tips"" article referenced are really niggling points of grammar and/or exposition.  They're best left to a last pass through the documentation. Yes, it's helpful when the piece doesn't read like a 7th-grader better versed in SMS texting wrote it. But if you're addressing these issues before hitting the four previous points, you're rearranging the belly button lint on the deck chairs on the Titanic.  It's a complete waste of time to start with, and at least three degrees removed from the real problem.",1321262722

Being exposed to advertising, as you say it yourself (when acknowledging that you don't have to click on the ads), is being unconsciously manipulated by them, and that's exactly what they are trying to do.<p>Advertising is not work, it is not producing anything useful for the society. It is only trying to either create needs or direct customer's attention to a particular vendor without any objective comparison between products, often creating value out of thin air just by gregarious feeling (so called ""brands"" making people happy to buy something not for what it brings to them but because they'll be happy to show their mates how cool they are to possess something with a particular logo on it).<p>So well, I recently installed AdBlock because I was tired of having my speakers start to shout silly songs when browsing the web at night, surprising me and making my heart rate jump sky high.

It seems to be the watershed when leftism stopped being about education and material welfare, and started being some kind of conceptual art project.",1321262297

Even the QA girl was a maths PhD. It was funny, all the alpha-PhD male programmers were always competing over who was the second-smartest... The smartest guy was <i>light years</i> ahead of anyone else (and the nicest bloke you could hope to meet). I always used to say, the rest of them should pick up his laundry and wash his car so he could concentrate more (they <i>really</i> liked that, HAHA).<p>I didn't do anything beyond the simplest algorithms, most of my work was on interfaces between our code and other stuff (like databases, data feeds, etc). Just grunt work really. Someone's got to do it tho'...",1257944352

8277653,comment,8276565,8277490,3,0,saryant,,,"The Scala community isn&#x27;t toxic.<p>There&#x27;s been drama and each time the community has moved on. Paul, Tony Morris and probably others from before I started paying any attention.  Even with this recent &quot;drama&quot;, after thinking about it for a few days, I&#x27;ve come to welcome it if anything.  Regular Scala can shift its focus to becoming a conservative language while Typelevel acts as the incubator.  If the two meet their compatibility goals, everyone wins.<p>I&#x27;d also argue that &quot;constantly making waves&quot; is an overstatement.  Scala just celebrated its tenth birthday.  How much drama has there really been in this community over ten years?  For the most part, I&#x27;ve found it to be very supportive.  My interactions are almost entirely just on the mailing lists but I&#x27;ve seen few issues.  Maybe I&#x27;m just blind to them, who knows.<p>I recognize that tensions within the community are high but I don&#x27;t currently believe that they present an insurmountable challenge to Scala&#x27;s future.",1409982911

I rely on a much better source, the thousands of sources that define science in the same way, unambiguously, including many court rulings, for example those that keep Creationism out of public school classrooms by defining science as something that requires empirical evidence and objective falsifiability.<p>> Alright, this is the end of the road for me.<p>Of course it is. Before we had this conversation you had no idea what constituted science and falsification, and now, you still have no idea.<p>I want to thank you for taking part in this conversation -- I often think it&#x27;s not possible for someone not to understand science basics -- it&#x27;s really rather simple -- but then I have a conversation like this, and I get it all over again.<p>> I don&#x27;t disagree that physics is a more mature science, where connections between different branches are more clear.<p>What you think, your opinions, <i>do not matter</i>. Only evidence matters. And it occurs to me that you will never get this.<p>Scientist A says, &quot;There is a largest prime. I don&#x27;t know which prime it is, but there is a largest one. Infinity is not a number, it&#x27;s a concept, therefore there cannot be an infinity of primes. Therefore there is a largest prime. Call it p.&quot;<p>Scientist B says, &quot;I will falsify your claim. I agree that we shall call the largest prime p. Now let q = p factorial, i.e. q = p * (p-1) * (p-2), etc. At the end of the process, q is either a prime larger than p, which falsifies the claim, or q is composite, composed of primes, at least one of which is larger than p, which falsifies the claim. There are no other possibilities. I have falsified the claim.&quot;<p>Scientist A says, &quot;Yes, you have falsified the claim, my opinion doesn&#x27;t matter, how I feel about it doesn&#x27;t matter, the falsification relies entirely on incontrovertible, objective evidence, <i>evidence on which all educated observers must agree</i>.&quot;<p>That is science. That is manifestly not psychology.<p>Another voice on this topic:<p><a href=""https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_site_summary.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/doc...</a><p>Quote: &quot;Today, all natural scientists throughout the world employ the scientific method. Normally it works like this: First, gather some data by observing an object or event, then propose an idea to explain the data, and finally test the idea by experimenting with Nature. Those ideas that pass the tests are selected, accumulated, and conveyed, while those that don’t are discarded — a little like the evolutionary events described on this Web site. In that way, by means of a selective editing or pruning of ideas, scientists discriminate between sense and nonsense. We gain an ever-better approximation of reality. Not that science claims to reveal the truth—whatever that is — just to gain an increasingly accurate model of Nature.&quot;<p>&quot;Despite an emphasis on objectivity, some subjectivity does affect the modern scientific enterprise, for this is work done by human beings having strong emotions and personal values. Yet, with the test of time and repeated observations, objectivity eventually emerges and then dominates, enabling us to reach conclusions free of the biased viewpoint of any one scientist, institution, or culture. As a rational investigative approach used to formulate descriptions of natural phenomena, the scientific method is designed to <i>yield a reasonably objective consensus on the nature, contents, and workings of the Universe</i>.&quot; [emphasis added]<p>Couldn&#x27;t have said it better myself.<p>Have a nice day.",1409982027

8277606,comment,8275970,8275970,7,0,sounds,,,"One important concept that seems to be missing from the discussion is Sender Stores.<p>Email currently uses a Receiver Stores model. SMTP servers can relay messages, but in almost all cases the message is transmitted directly from the originator&#x27;s network to the recipient&#x27;s network. The storage of the message only effectively changes _ownership_ once, even if the message headers say it was forwarded many times.<p>That makes email a Receiver Stores model: the recipient&#x27;s network is expected to accept the message at any time and then hold it until the recipient comes to look at it.<p>Some of the bitcoin messaging protocols propose a Sender Stores model. That is, the message may be transmitted any number of times but the recipient&#x27;s network is not responsible for long-term storage. The sender&#x27;s network must be able to provide the message at any time up to the point when the recipient actually looks at the message.<p>There are some obvious restrictions such as requiring that the message be encrypted with a Diffie-Helman key (negotiated when the message is first transmitted to the receiver&#x27;s network) to reduce the feasibility of de-duplicating millions of messages. And in order to prevent revealing exactly when the recipient reads the message, the recipient&#x27;s network doesn&#x27;t ack the message for a while.<p>Ultimately all of this is just designed to make bulk email (slightly) more expensive.

Your argument would be far more persuasive if Google were really biting the bullet and dropping support for SHA1 even when an old browser connects. I assume that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re doing, but please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.<p>If you are returning two different certificates for two different situations at Google.com, the least you could do is dedicate some of your vast engineering resources to making the plugins to support such a setup production ready. If Google uses it&#x27;s technical sophistication to avoid the pain while the rest of the web burns then that&#x27;s, at best, hypocritical.<p>I&#x27;ll make you this deal: if you do it for Apache, we&#x27;ll do it for NGINX.

8277588,comment,8277343,8277343,29,0,creamyhorror,,,"Enjoyable, nostalgic thread. Later on one member (age 78) of the core Concorde design team even appears. Here&#x27;s an amusing anecdote from early in the thread:<p>========<p>Whilst on the Concorde conversion course at Bristol, occasionally crews would have the privilege of meeting some of the original design engineers and draughtsmen who had worked on the Concorde project.<p>...<p>Suffice to say that the senior fire officer who misread litres-per-minute as gallons-per-minute during an Olympus water ingestion test probably would not want any further publicity, likewise the apprentice who didn’t defrost the chicken before firing it into an engine running at full power in the bird ingestion test. My favourite was the supersonic hailstone story, fired as part of a hailstone ingestion test, but with uncertain results, the final resting place of said hailstone still being slightly obscure to this day. If anyone in the greater Bristol area got hit by a particularly hard snowball in the early sixties, the Filton test engineers are very sorry, and would like to apologise!<p>However, it is often the little insights into the past that amuse one the most and stick in one’s mind. During one such conversation, with a couple of thermodynamicists, I ventured to ask how they had settled on the (rather difficult to memorise) various temperature limits associated with Concorde.<p>For instance, why a nose temperature limit of +127°C, why not +130°C, much easier for a pilot to remember?<p><i>“Isn’t it obvious?”</i> one replied politely, genuinely puzzled by my question.<p><i>“Computer generation,”</i> replied his colleague to him, pointing his pipe stem at me.<p><i>“Ah yes,”</i> said the first, <i>“that would be it.”</i><p>They then went on to explain, in ever such a kindly manner, that, in thermodynamics, apparently the square, and the square root, of the absolute temperature of a material are terms used in many equations. Being armed mostly only with slide rules (and as they were in the vicinity of 120°C to 130°C as a limit anyway) it had been decided to make life easy and settle on +127°C as the limit, a temperature for which they could easily calculate the square and square root in their heads.<p>Noticing my bewilderment at the thought that anyone might be able to calculate the square or the square root of 127 in their heads, they proceeded to explain it to me still further, very slowly; in the manner that one would speak to an aged and rather deaf great aunt!<p><pre><code>    • Absolute zero = -273°C = Zero Kelvin = 0K\n    • Max Nose temp = +127°C equal to 400K\n    • √400 = 20\n    • 400² = 160,000.\n</code></pre>\nThese are the people with the amusing stories to tell!",1409980177

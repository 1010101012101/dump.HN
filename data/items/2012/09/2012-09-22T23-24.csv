4559389,comment,4558474,4558474,12,0,tptacek,,,"Not a fan. We tend to react to offers like this as if they were obviously equitable: after all, we're getting paid for the time even if we're not good matches. But the offers are never equitable, because they're almost invariably calibrated to your starting salary. In other words, ""we'll pay you for two weeks, and then, if it works out, we'll commit to paying you indefinitely"".<p>In the real market, a commitment to pay only two weeks comes attached to a <i>drastic</i> jump in your rate. If you expect a $100k offer, your 2-week rate isn't $50/hr; it's probably something much closer to $100/hr. There are a lot of reasons for this:<p>* Your cost basis as a contractor is higher than your cost basis as an employee; for instance, you're paying ~2x payroll tax, and paying to maintain your own health insurance.<p>* Your full-time salary includes a sizable discount that buys continuous payment, even when you aren't being utilized. A contractor doesn't make a dime when they're not doing billable work.<p>* Your rate includes the opportunity cost of not doing whatever else it was you could have been doing (if there's nothing you can be doing except accepting this offer, I guess you can't really negotiate it --- but then, fix THAT problem, stat.)<p>There's more not to like about these temp-to-perm arrangements. For starters, in a lot of jobs, the first N weeks of your employment are going to be your least productive. A lot of that time is going to be spent ramping up. One wonders whether offers like this are a manipulative way of getting people to work their asses off to minimize ramp-up cost; that practice would obviously be abusive.<p>Downthread, 'gruseom says he wishes offers like this were more common, because the risk of a bad fit with a new role cuts both ways. But it doesn't! Employment virtually everywhere in the US is at will. If you're in a bad fit, just leave; or, better yet, negotiate with the company owners, confident that you have a strong BATNA (what do you have to lose?).<p>If you come across a gig that wants to do this temp-to-perm dance, and you're amenable to it, my advice is to ask instead to just do a series of contracting gigs at a reasonable rate instead of taking full-time employment. Let the prospective employer get used to the idea of working with you, and do that at a contractor rate, so that when the time comes to cut over to full-time, your salary requirements automatically look sane in comparison.<p>More people should learn how to freelance. If a job's going to force you to do it, seize the opportunity to do it right.",1348357642

But then again, as a patient it's a ton of work to really be on top of your care.

Also, Greenlets run cooperatively meaning each one gains control of the CPU until it's done with its computation or hits an IO call.

Last night, I couldn't sleep well because of some noise outside and I had this dream.  One of those dreams where it is so vivid and the story line is so clear, and there are ""scenes"" almost like a film where the ""camera"" zooms in on some aspect, that you wake up remembering the details and go ""WTF?  What does that <i>mean</i>?""<p>So I thought about some of the things I remebered for a little bit.  Some of these details made absolutely no sense.  They served no purpose in the storyline of the dream.  And suddenly it hit me they were derived from <i>words</i> I had used in HN posts.  Not topics, but individual words.  My brain had woven them into the story.  And it had done so with some pretty crafty storytelling.  I'm not sure I could have done it so well if I was awake.<p>As if you gave someone a list of random words and said, ""Make up a story and weave each of these words into the story.""<p>I guess this is nothing unusual.  Probably happens to people every night.  But it left me thinking about how just how ""self-driving"" the brain is.  What the heck is it doing when we go to sleep?

Assuming that every client should get the highest-resolution (and thus highest-bandwidth and highest-memory-cost) assets is just lazy.<p>Use Javascript. Something like <a href=""https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill</a> works beautifully and results in only one request per asset, with a noscript fallback. It's more markup, which is kind of a pain in the ass, but it means that the right clients get the right assets and you don't end up destroying your poor EDGE and 3G customers because you decided they needed a 2400x1200 splash image. Let's not forget that a ""retina"" image imposes a 4x memory cost on the client - image data has to be decompressed to be displayed. So, your user on their mobile phone with 512mb of RAM is going to have a terrible experience when your website is using 4x more of their precious RAM on images that don't actually provide them with any visual benefit.<p>Double-pixel displays are still, by a massive margin, the exception. Unless you're specifically serving a Retina Macbook-targeted audience, you're going to incur a lot of overhead for no appreciable benefit for the majority of your audience.",1348355268

That's a reach.<p>I happen to think that your view that ""When will <snip> technical males realise that the government created the industries they worked in through decades long investment where the free market failed to do so."" is flawed in a million different ways.<p>Virtually nothing government does is done well, efficiently and with true far-reaching vision towards future goals that will benefit all.<p>In most cases it the results are nowhere near what government expected.<p>The ""invention"" of the Internet is one such examples.  While the genesis is solidly found in ARPANET not one person in government PLANNED for what we have today.  Natural market evolutionary forces made this happen.  Lots of entrepreneurs and investors throwing money, blood, sweat and tears into the pot and here we are.  If it were up to government we'd still be trying to figure out how to raise taxes to pay for some ridiculous solution that nobody would want.  Fortunes were made and lost giving the Internet life.  Government couldn't even approach the people and financial investment that went into actually making it.  Look at examples like Webvan to see the risks people took back then.  Eight hundred million dollars pissed away chasing an idea.  Yes, it was a failure, but that's EXACTLY what the free market is about.  Some win.  Some loose.  And we all benefit from those who try.<p>How about jumping into bullshit wars?  How is that working for you?  You certainly can't pin that one on private enterprise, can you?<p>Nah, what needs to realized here is that we are an incredibly capable species that thrives by being challenged.  We develop solutions by cooperating towards common goals and, yes, when there are benefits to be had (financial, intellectual, emotional, altruistic, etc.).<p>Government, at least in the US, has degenerated into a do-whatever-it-takes-to-get-votes organism.  All parties. All ideologies.  They all want votes to stay in power 'cause it's a sweet ride.  That's all they care about.  Not you, I or our kids. Nothing else matters. The sooner we realize that and start to figure out how to fix it the better off we will be.  Interference with private enterprise is just one side-effect of how these governments are failing us.<p>I don't really like political labels that much because they don't really represent the person.  I tend to use ""libertarian"" because, well, the other have nearly never represented me.  One side is overly religious and the other side can be reminiscent of populist South American dictators that rile-up the masses, give them shit and buy votes.  None of it good.  I prefer to believe in the individual, the power of self determination and the drive to succeed.  I could be wrong, but I think this is far better than some organization telling a startup that they can't disrupt the cab industry because, well, THEY don't want it disrupted.<p>It's like asking buggy-whip workers if their industry should go out of business in order to allow automobiles to happen.  Of course they'll say ""no"", and the politicians and unions that might represent them would have raise hell to protect them.  In the end, protecting that industry would have been a huge mistake.",1348355187

The fact that changes to laws are being proposed in order to shut Uber down proves that Uber is perfectly legal under the current laws, which means Uber is well within its rights to open up shop without asking permission. In fact, if Uber were public and I was a shareholder, I'd be pretty pissed-off if Uber actually asked for permission first, because that's just asking to be shut down.<p>Any sort of disruptive business will get lots of pushback and anticompetitive pressures from the existing incumbents. There's no reason why Uber needs to make it easier for someone else to block them from operating.",1348355045

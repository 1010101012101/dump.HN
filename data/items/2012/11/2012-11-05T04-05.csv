4742263,comment,4740378,4741865,2,0,bpatrianakos,,,"No. The copy argument is bunk. It's not about depriving someone of product, it's about depriving someone payment. In the case of software there is unlimited supply but there isn't an unlimited amount of consumers. Each consumer who circumvents the payment process deprives the creator of the payment they ask of their work. So now you'll argue that they wouldn't have paid anyway but that's also a terrible argument. The original post shows that some people would pay but won't because it's too ""inconvenient"" to. Furthermore, even if they wouldn't have paid anyway they should have, it's still wrong that they have and use the software and they still deprived the creator of payment.

The incentives are aligned, Facebook wants you to engage with items in your News Feed. Page owners want people to engage with their posts. If you don't like it as a user, you can change the News Feed sort to ""Most Recent."" Advertisers who don't want engagement can potentially buy different kinds of ad units to accomplish whatever it is that you care about (clicks, sales, etc).<p>I do think Facebook wants to keep you on Facebook, so they paid attention first to making ""native"" ads that work on Facebook. If you are only going for traffic to your site, you are not using your Facebook Page for what it's best at, which is helping you naturally become part of a conversation that people are having with their friends. I think that's very meaningful and a much better advertising experience. If you care about traffic, Twitter's promoted tweets are very good at sending traffic to your site. If you think about it, that also makes sense because that's what's ""natural"" on Twitter (i.e. we use Twitter to discover interesting content online that we can then click on to go consume).<p>With that said, Mark Cuban did recently get really angry about this too (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=460717227304430&set=a.185767724799383.39013.156011887774967&type=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=460717227304430&...</a>) and I understand why. He worked hard to get 2.3M fans on Facebook for the Dallas Mavericks because that's what Facebook was about before. But then a post only reached 27k fans organically and he was asked to pony up $3k to reach ~50% of his fans. That just sounds too much like blackmail. Facebook failed to communicate and manage the expectations of Page owners. They didn't know that their posts were never reaching 100% of the fans, and when that became apparent, they noticed that the algorithm was updated and depressed the reach numbers significantly. With the recent IPO, Page owners think Facebook is money hungry, and then they noticed the new Promoted Posts so they fired back. Facebook could've just communicated more to manage people's expectations along the way.",1352089756

Being followed by a man not behaving according to social rules is an obvious possible threat that hardly needs to be proven, but how creepy it is to be surveillanced is another and more interesting point to prove.<p>So the experiment should be redone to factor out the creepy man. That means, either have a trusted and passive person do the filming (police, reflex-vest, etc) or to set up a tripod with a camera. Even if it was made clear that the video would be streamed to public, I think very few people would react as they did above, simply because a film camera is a lot less threatening than an unknown, weird person.<p>Dressing up the cameraman in different clothes and behavioural patterns would emphasize this point further.

Onsite generator, fiber, etc., and a way to split the building into public event space for 100 or so people, and offices, with private offices for everyone, with courtyard-type spaces for the groups of offices.  300-500 square feet per person in the ""office"" area.<p>The smaller buildings on Plymouth in MV, or Pioneer Way, or some of the office parks in Menlo, would all be fine.<p>I doubt most other startups want this -- they all want shared spaces with big open plan offices in nice buildings in downtown SF, it seems.",1352089547

    sequence of keys and f is a function that will take the old value

4742216,comment,4739883,4740746,1,0,IgorPartola,,,"Correct, my viewpoint is that seatbelt laws are a good thing. Your insurance company will make you pay more for not wearing seatbelts. The math dictates it. I have no way to make you pay more (other than raising your taxes which you may or may not pay depending on your income). Thus my only recourse is to make you wear a seatbelt via a law that my representatives in the government impose and enforce. Do I have any business making you pay for not wearing a seatbelt (via fines or higher premiums)? Yes, so long as I am on the hook for your medical bills. The waiver I mention is fictional not only because we could never enforce it, but also because the medical staff admitting you takes an oath to treat you. However, my argument is that the waiver is the minimum requirement for the financial math to work out. Therefore seatbelt laws are in place for a reason, do more good than harm, and are absolutely in my right to demand of my government. In that sense my argument is absolutely sincere.<p>On top of the above, I spent many years in a country with a poor healthcare system and lax seatbelt laws. The results were not pretty.<p>Lastly, in your original post you seem to suggest a possibility that the government telling you to put on a seatbelt is somehow comparable to being a slave in the early days of this country. If that really was your suggestion, I am not sure how to respond to such misrepresentation of reality.",1352088954

I believe there is a threshold level of performance beyond which casual users cannot discern any improvement.<p>I believe that threshold for CPU performance is currently around a low/mid-range i5.  Getting a faster processor than that will not translate into any tangible benefits in everyday usage.  Even if there were a CPU that had twice the performance of an i5, an end user can not tell the difference between ""practically instantaneous"" and ""1/2 practically instantaneous.""<p>Likewise, there are limits to storage capacity.  My parents, for example, store everything on a single 1TB hard disk.  Their drive barely has 250GB used, OS and all.  At their current rate of consumption, they <i>might</i> exceed 50% disk use in 5 years.   Now we could come up with cases where the computer user is a photographer, a videographer, or likes to collect linux isos, but I believe in most real ""casual use"" cases, anything >1TB (currently) may as well be infinite.<p>Obviously there are also upper limits on what screen size a casual user would be able to effectively utilize.  We should note, of course, that many casual users do not understand how to effectively manage windows between two monitors.  I think the coming increase in pixel density coupled with a medium (say, 21 inch) monitor would provide a casual user with about as much screen as they could effectively use.<p>Lastly, there are cost trade-offs for all these things.  Consider home internet.  It is true that power users might be able to make do with internet speeds that would frustrate casual users (e.g. using Opera Turbo or using a data plan.)  However, in my area for example, you would have to pay roughly 3x as much to get a ""performance"" 25 Mbps package versus the entry level 3-5 Mbps.

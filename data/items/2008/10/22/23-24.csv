340728,comment,339899,340713,0,0,netcan,,,"Personally I think the most important of the anti zealot side of this debate is the insistence on everything being centred on code being written by hand.<p>Dingy little WYSIWYG editors, machine generated web pages, & (in this context, I suppose) software that allows users to generate anything from blogs to shops to social news sites without any technical knowledge, and all their friends have probably done more for for the web (& it's accessibility) then standards have.<p>We aren't there yet. From online shops to Slinkset, you still need a little css & html to get you past a certain level of control. But I think it would be an achievement, if these weren't needed any more & 'view source' got taken out of browsers from lack of use.",1224719509

340713,comment,339899,340695,0,0,tdavis,,,"1. Yeah, I guess I worded that incorrectly, though you can see the tie-in between semantics and how that html is executed (rendered). Using proper semantics = not using tables for page layout = better rendering (under circumstances mentioned)<p>2. ... so you're saying we should write HTML, then write XML to describe that HTML? Why not just write HTML which describes itself in the first place? It seems awfully redundant to do it any other way, considering HTML comes with all these handy tags which, when used correctly, describe the content already. Hell, XHML was created as an HTML which conforms to the XML spec for precisely this purpose.<p>If you write something like:<p><pre><code>    <body><div id=""content""><h1>My Cool Site</h1></div></body> \n</code></pre>\nYou've already ""encoded"" it. If you write:<p><pre><code>    <body><table><tr><td colspan=2><font color=""red""><big>My Cool Site</big></font></td></tr></table></body>\n</code></pre>\nThen, yeah, you've got your work cut out for you to give <i>that</i> any sort of meaning...<p>3. <i>""And in that case munging the results afterwards is as inelegant as patching machine code.""</i> -- Right, so your choices are write it yourself or get a bunch of garbage generated by an IDE or Framework or whatever. If you're happy with the garbage then you probably don't need to edit it afterwards or just ""edit"" it using the same IDE or language or whatever. What happens when your IDE or framework or language can't generate HTML/CSS to do something you need? Then you have to start editing that crap by hand... this should eventually lead to suicide.",1224717891
340712,comment,340395,340395,0,0,Sam_Odio,,,"This is class uncov flamebait.  The author sets up several straw men, and then proceeds to valiantly strike them down.  Yahoo, like all companies, has made a number of investments in startups.  Some of them work out (viaweb, anyone?), some don't.  Unfortunately, this article lacks a concrete analysis of all the investments yahoo has made.  Instead, the author makes the argument that yahoo shouldn't have made $2.5bn in investments because three (totaling $0.248BN) haven't turned out well.",1224717853

Obviously, people are looking more for an opportunity to save than to spend. Can you help them do that?""<p>In my consulting experience in the corporate sector, it seems to me that while executives are interested in hypothetical savings, they are simply less interested in investing in products or services altogether.

It makes expansion much easier, because people are most willing to loan money to people who don't need it.  I kind of expect it's the same in the startup world...if you're sitting on a large pile of cash with a low burn rate and high profitability, you can probably raise cash a lot easier than a startup that's down to their last nickel with a huge burn rate and no profitability in sight, yes?",1224716525

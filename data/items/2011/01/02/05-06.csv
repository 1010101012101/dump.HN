They'll never install more than 3 applications, will pay out their ass for texting and will be perfectly happy flashing their iPhone to their friends. Meanwhile, 4 more Android phones are activated without any excitement, where the respective user also probably never installs a wide range of apps and pays the carrier's exhuberant SMS fee.<p>Is Gruber suggesting, or am I supposed to buy the notion that the emotional appeal of a product is some sort of important measurement? Who's activating more phones, who's making the revenue.<p>I'll never stand in line for an Android phone, I won't even stay up late to press ""Buy"" on when the purchase link goes live for the HTC Thunderbolt.

Apple products do have a huge emotional appeal to it. The price for which is weirdly, both the cause and effect at the same time. Most people who buy Apple will continue to buy Apple (they are already buying products that are not cheap by any means, so cheaper Android phones won't do much to dampen that enthusiasm).<p>Fact is that most people won't line up to buy Android and certainly not as many as Apple fans. Does that mean Android won't sell - hell, no. It will only sell more.<p>Most of the complaints about Android from Apple fans seem to be on the lines of - ""hey it is imperfect and a lesser phone but why does it still sell?""

If your product does solve a real problem, and solves really well, you'll get the users.<p>If you just make something cool that doesn't really do anything people need, well then, don't blame it on market saturation.<p>There are types of apps that you can only reap the fruit of when there are lots of users. These apps can't succeed if they require you to pay before using it. Facebook is useless if you don't have friends on it. A blog is useless if people had to pay before reading it.

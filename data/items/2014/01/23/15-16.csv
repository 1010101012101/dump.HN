Mainframes are where the money is for IBM.<p>Yup.  even if that&#x27;s only 10% of their revenue, I bet it&#x27;s a lot more of their profit.   Margins on assembling servers are driven down by massive competition, and by the fact that it&#x27;s really difficult to &#x27;differentiate&#x27; x86;  your product is  the same microchips as the competition on very similar boards in very similar metal boxes.  (Which isn&#x27;t to say the margins are zero, it&#x27;s just that the customer has a lot more negotiation ammo.  Your sales person has to work a lot harder.)<p>This situation is very good for the consumer, of course;  they can reasonably play one supplier off of five.

Not only does this give you the ability to get into emacs without going through init, the server will maintain all of your editing in the same process so you don&#x27;t have to manage editor instances.",1390491075

It&#x27;s one thing to make an inadvertent disclosure yourself on some mailing list or another, it&#x27;s quite another to have activities from multiple sources aggregated and de-anonymized for you.<p>I&#x27;m of an age which learned &quot;you don&#x27;t transact personal business online&quot;.  I&#x27;ve found e-commerce, online banking, social networking, and the like to be highly curious in that regard, and the long tail of tears (yes, with many successes) to be rather predictable.  Maintaining an offline separation for these activities isn&#x27;t a perfect solution either, though it does generally provide me with plausible deniability and far fewer opportunities to worry about disclosure, though integrating surveillance into phones with integrated GPS tracking your location everywhere makes things a tad more difficult (read Stallman&#x27;s many postings on this topic).<p>It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m planning on a life of crime or terror, but I&#x27;ve already seen my (largely professional / intellectual) online activities come back to me, and by disassociating myself from what I do in my online an offline life (much as you describe), I&#x27;m sparing myself that pain.<p>Facebook is arguably worse than Google in this regard, but both companies have a positively autistic lack of emotional comprehension over this issue.",1390491062

The input is malicious, and contains not only XML data, but XML directives to include other documents, specifically /etc/passwd on the location machine. The XML document is processed, the contents of /etc/passwd are automatically read by the XML parser/processor.

7108675,comment,7107735,7108341,2,0,bhauer,,,"This sentiment that Nokia <i>should make</i> or <i>should have made</i> Android phones is common.  I won&#x27;t disagree with the article that Lumia sales are disappointing and that Nokia would have faced much harder decisions today were they not part of Microsoft.<p>But I find it surprising how often I hear fans of Android bemoan the dearth of Nokia Android phones.  It implies that there is some hole in the Android market that would be filled by Nokia.  That is remarkable—I&#x27;d go so far to say implausible—considering the wide spectrum of manufacturers already providing Android hardware.<p>A quick glance at Verizon&#x27;s current offerings shows seven manufacturers offering Android phones via Verizon, many with multiple options.  Meanwhile, for fans of Windows Phone—few of those as there may be—we have Nokia, Samsung, and HTC, offering one option each.  And if rumors are to believed, Samsung may only be offering Windows Phone thanks to Microsoft paying them to do so.<p>To suggest that Nokia should offer Android phones implies there is some subtle quirk or distinguishing design element that would make a Nokia android preferable to the seven existing Android manufacturers&#x27; offerings.  Certainly there isn&#x27;t anything as substantial as a wholly new look and feel or new way of working with applications to distinguish the potential Nokia Android phone from those seven other manufacturers.  So it would be something like the color of the case, maybe a few proprietary apps, the material, a few minor specs such as a good camera or wireless charging.  Though many existing Android phones offer all of those things and more.<p>Meanwhile, being the principal Windows Phone manufacturer brings <i>actual</i> variation to the consumer.  In fact, taking away the operating system, the Lumia hardware is not very unique.  Spec-by-spec, it&#x27;s about on par with an average Android phone.  But it piqued my interest because it&#x27;s not-Android and I wanted something new to try having become tired of the same old thing.  My wife is now waiting for the Icon to be released to replace her Galaxy Nexus because she too wants to move on.<p>So yes, Nokia&#x27;s sales are disappointing.  Maybe they will look up in the future.  Maybe not.  But as a consumer, I <i>treasure</i> that they offer something more interesting than just another Android phone.",1390490541

7108669,comment,7107735,7108493,4,0,vidarh,,,"> All phones cost that much.<p>Let me start by saying I agree with your point about pointing out the cost of taking the &quot;subsidy&quot;. Personally that&#x27;s part of my reason for the phones I&#x27;ve had the last couple of years. I figured that the subsidy in fact is costing me enough that if I opt for slightly cheaper models (see below), I can, if I want to, easily justify upgrading once a year instead of once every 18-24 months as is typical for the contracts here, and given my propensity for having phones slip out of my hands and end up shattering on the floor on the other side of the room, I figured that&#x27;d be a good idea...<p>But going to $600 for a smartphone is not at all necessary these days unless you &quot;must&quot; have the very latest and greatest. For those of us willing to put up with last years performance, you can get great quad core phones with full hd (1920x1080) screens based on MTK or Rockchip CPU&#x27;s for well under half that.<p>I swore off the flagship phones a year ago - the tier down and cheap Chinese knockoffs that do lag behind performance wise but are otherwise fantastic, are &quot;fast enough&quot; now that I just don&#x27;t have any need for anything faster.<p>My latest unsubsidised phone is an iOcean X7. With an extra 3000mAh battery it cost me ca $250 for the 32GB version (internal, also supports 32GB micro SD) including paying extra to get it shipped from China in 5 days (many of these models you can also find on Amazon Marketplace from a variety of importers if uncomfortable with ordering direct). It&#x27;s a fantastic phone, with just a couple of minor caveats (the GPS is shit on a number of the Chinese phones - it&#x27;s a known chipset problem coupled with bad antenna design; for this model there&#x27;s a known easy non-invasive fix).<p>I&#x27;m unlikely to consider a phone above $300 again anytime soon...",1390490469

Everything you do in Emacs (even arrow up, left or right) is bound to an Emacs function. So if you start out, and you want to do something, but you don&#x27;t know the shortcut, just do CMD-. and start typing. The naming is really good. Say you want to deactivate line truncation. You go into MX and type &quot;truncate&quot; and among the results will be &quot;toggle-truncate-lines&quot; you go there, hit enter, and you&#x27;re done. This is a bit more difficult in stock Emacs, as it has no wildcard search for MX but I&#x27;m using the Helm plugin, which offers this feature and makes it really really easy to find functions. I hardly ever use all these Emacs shortcuts like C-c C-e ... I just hit MX and type what I need to do.<p>Sadly, startup is still really slow for my configuration, which is why I have a Vim config with similar keys for quick Terminal usage.

This reinforces my concept that Amazon is reasonable to deal with, and I&#x27;ll be more likely to buy from them, other things being equal.<p>Similarly this is why I have a preference for Square and Stripe over other similar services, my local $preferred_brand car dealership (over other local ones) and so on with other reasonable to deal with companies. At the end of the day, I&#x27;m willing to pay even a bit more if the hassle is lower, or expected to be lower should I need something &#x27;weird&#x27; (defined as: not just purchase and walk away forever).<p>Generating a little bit of good feeling towards your business is totally worth some overhead cost.",1390489403

It&#x27;s not as simple as &quot;Nations must be able to fight wars.&quot; Details matter a great deal, and I think a case could be made that even if war-fighting is necessary, the vast majority of what we <i>currently spend</i> on it is unnecessary and immoral.<p>Further, who decides what&#x27;s necessary? I imagine a hard-core pacifist would argue that national defense is <i>not</i> actually a necessity. That same person might argue that access to good health care, including contraception, is a fundamental human right and therefore funding that <i>is</i> a necessity. Why should someone be forced to pay for anything they find immoral and unnecessary, even if <i>you</i> happen to think it&#x27;s necessary?<p>My own response to that would be that some people are simply wrong about that, and allowing people to opt out of things they feel are unnecessary and immoral simply wouldn&#x27;t work. The good thing about government is that it allows us to take collective actions that benefit us all but would fall victim to things like the free rider problem if they were funded voluntarily. But then we need some way of collectively deciding what&#x27;s worth funding through government and forcing people to pay for, and what&#x27;s not.<p>And this really just puts is back where we started. We have to fund some things, and no matter what they are, some taxpayers will feel that those things are unnecessary and immoral. That, I think, indicates that &quot;I shouldn&#x27;t be required to pay for things I find immoral&quot; is not a good argument.",1390489380

But it doesn&#x27;t handle the case where you have lots of instances of the same view class in a list and want each handler registered only once for the whole list. You can do this manually by checking out the event target and maintaining a mapping from dom nodes to views, which you ought to do if you have lists of hundreds or thousands of repeated subviews. But Ember and various Backbone plugins can do this for you automatically.",1390489356

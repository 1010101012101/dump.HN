3120716,comment,3119155,3120447,2,0,dpark,,,"> <i>And GC is always less efficient than no GC, even with more memory.</i><p>No, it's not. GC allows for more efficiency in many scenarios. Imagine creating and destroying many small objects. With traditional memory management, every malloc incurs a cost to allocate a chunk of memory from the free store. This will involve some work to break the correct-sized piece of memory off some larger block, and some bookkeeping for later restoring that memory to the block and possibly enlarging the block, merging with others, etc.<p>On the other hand, in a modern generational GC, a malloc typically consists of adjusting a single pointer to the nursery pool by the size requested.<p>Depending on the scenario, GC can be just as fast, or even faster.  In other scenarios, manual memory management may be faster.",1318863540

I don't know anyone who would ask a developer to ""rewrite the code to not be ugly"" (without providing specifics).  I think it's a useful informal term for when specifics aren't needed: ""making this change will require us to touch the X module, which is really ugly, so factor that into your time estimate"" (if both developers know the X module, this needs no further explanation).  In other words, I've not encountered any discussions where ""ugly""'s ambiguity has caused problems.<p>Sometimes ""ugly"" really seems to hit the nail on the head, like when code fails to communicate what it does or why it works (e.g., due to an implementation that looks like it resulted from brownian-motion trial and error).",1318863333

Which has made me not listen to Build & Analyze, or use his app. Hell, ""Build & Analyze"" isn't so much about ""Building & Analyzing"" as it is him bitching about stuff. I'm not even talking about the coffee discussions, I can get through that stuff, the bullshit attitude I can't get through though.<p>He used to be pretty humble in the first dozen episodes, but he's slowly gotten a big head and turned into a dick. At least from my perspective.<p>I don't recommend his app any longer, instead, I suggest people use one of it's competitors, Read It Later.<p>Again, the podcast isn't so much about building apps as it is a soapbox for him to complain about other applications and other developers. While he does discuss some of the aspects of Instapaper, he may as well have called the podcast something else. If you're expecting developer oriented discussion there are better podcasts to listen to.<p>If you're going to spend time listening to a 5by5 podcast, I suggest two that are much better. Hypercritical with John Siracusa. John at least knows how to complain while being constructive, unlike Marco. The second would be The Incomparable, on a totally different topic but very worthwhile.<p>As as example of marco being an ass. Just listen to any of the podcasts from 10-onward. Also, listen especially to the programming episodes where he tries to argue against Siracusa but instead sounds like a whiny brat.<p>edit: Keep on down voting people. Seriously. It's called an opinion. If you don't like it, too bad. But it helps people make a valid attempt at determining whether they want to listen to something, or read something, otherwise spending their time with something. Make your own opinion of the podcast and Marco. But down voting simply because my opinion is different than yours is just stupid.",1318863243

Building the whole dependency graph for all versions of a gem with many dependencies in itself will a) take a very long time and b) probably be huge - likely much bigger than the whole gem index that was downloaded up until 1.1. The time required for parsing those MB after MB of data of which most will be thrown away will quickly get significant.<p>Another option would be to query for all dependencies of a specific version of a gem. That would reduce the amount of data, but it would still mean more work for the server and it would produce a lot more data to cache (much of which would never be queried more than once)<p>With the currently applied method, only the data that's really required must be queried and it can easily be cached on the server side too.",1318863162

Massively adopted by IT organizations, the Sonar platform provides Continuous Inspection capability on application portfolio to track quality defects and report them into customizable dashboards (test coverage, duplications, architecture integrity, rule compliance, complexity, etc.). Used by many large corporations, Sonar performs analysis on billions lines of code... daily.<p>What's hot in this release?<p>- Cross-Project Detection of Code Duplication: so far the detection of copy paste code was only done inside a project. Thanks to GSoC, Sonar has now got its own Copy-Paste Detection that is very scalable and can detect cross-projects duplications.<p>- TimeMachine 2.0, the ability to replay the past has been greatly improved and is now fully part of dashboards as it is widget based. This means that the evolution of any metric can be tracked along with the dashboard. And in order to not display irelevant analysis, it is now possible to removed them.<p>Read the release note : http://www.sonarsource.org/downloads/#2.11

3120655,comment,3119932,3119932,10,0,SimHacker,,,"Ideas for games are not at all scarse. They are not at all hard to come up with. They are not at all unique. In fact, ideas for games are much more trouble than they are worth. Game developers don't need any more ideas. The only way to ship a game on time is to brutally throw away as many ideas as you can, until you have the smallest design that will actually work and be fun, and then EXECUTE on that.<p>Execution is what matters, not ideas. Everybody wants to be the ""idea guy,"" because they think that's the easy part, and the glorious part, where they just sit there and tell other people what to do, and get all the credit. But there are very few positions in the industry for ""idea guy"", and the only people who get them have a proven track record.<p>I work for Will Wright, who is an idea guy. It's my job to execute on his ideas, come up with prototypes that let him play around with the ideas, and then throw them away and start from scratch when he gets different ideas, or rewrite, iterate and polish the good ones until they're production quality. The designs he gives me are high level enough that there's lots of room for creativity, filling in the gaps between the design and the implementation. But the only reason I get the privilege to exercise any creativity is because I'm also executing on the hard part: implementing the code.<p>If you don't want to actually do the heavy lifting and grunt work of writing code, and if you aren't willing to throw it all away and start from scratch when the designers decide they want something else, or work on the complex, tedious plumbing that nobody will notice, then it's going to be very hard for you to find a job in the games industry.<p>The best thing to do is to write your own game, all by yourself. Then you will have something to show. But nobody in the industry wants to hear your idea, if you don't have something to show that works and is fun, because it's just a distraction from executing on their own ideas.<p>But now days it's entirely possible for one person or a small team to actually execute on their own idea and produce a good game, like Minecraft for example, as long as they're willing to do the hard work, and not just into it just because they think it will be an easy, glorious job to be the ""idea guy"" who tells other people what to do and takes all the credit.<p>And for god's sake, if you have no intention of doing any programming or other hard work, and you are just looking for a programmer to do all the ""easy"" work for you for equity instead of salary, now that you've done the ""hard part"" of coming up with the idea for the world's greatest game or iPhone app, then please fuck off and die.

(A bad coder will say ""ugly"" for any kind of code he did not write.) Here are some of the reasons behind ""ugliness"":<p>- Wrong logic giving correct results (this is awful)<p>- Hidden dependencies making remote changes dangerous (b)<p>- Misleading variable or function name<p>- Unnecessary use of magic (eg programmatically building function names), this breaks a lot of code analyser, and makes your code base ungreppable, which is very bad.<p>- Code duplication and configuration factorization.<p>- Nasty hack breaking the model (eg changing request parameters on the fly)<p>All in all, I agree with the OP premices, but not with his solution. Adding comments all over the code is not going to save you, and making sure you understand all corners of the module you work on before starting to modify a comma is not that helpful either. In front of a montain of legacy code that need some ordering, if it is a short cycles mode with versionning, I would:<p>- First make sure my tools are accurate and fast. It mostly means tweaking my grep alias, so I grep all the code and nothing more. I may mean to find a way to run the modified code in less that 3 secs (unit tests can help for that part).<p>- Second, don't try to understand all the thing, start low, maybe rename a few variables that are obviously wrong, for example marking them as private (adding _ prefix in python).<p>- You won't know were are the painful points in the begining, so you should continue doing safe & simple refactorings, one step at a time, in order to slowly ""wake up"" the code. A bit of temporay commenting can help, like ""this func returns a x-blob used by that module"".<p>- Then when you become familiar with the code you'll be in position to decide if and where to do some real changes. Some people here seem to believe that legacy code should not be changed except in case of earthquake. I don't agree. Adding a pile of hacky crap over a pile of hacky crap to make the thing temporary work is not a good bet on the future: do it only if you plan to leave your company soon enough.<p>- Doing a bigger change might require some iterations and lacemaker work. If possible, you can bridge the legacy code, ie write a func_new and compare it's result with func_old during one iteration, to kinda prove that they are the same.<p>- I noticed that it is sometime useful to take a big class, a big god-like object doing too much, and cut it in much smaller pieces. Sometime you may have to re-glue together some pieces because you went too far, sometime you may even kind-of rollback your changes, but in any case these operations will shaken the code base a bit, which is good.<p>These operations require courage regarding of the code base, because you will feel lost sometime, you will fear regressions, you may even fix a functionality that should not be working and, consequentially, break something. Here, be careful, you should not be fixing broken parts and refactor in the same operations, except if you know enough to be sure. One purpose of refactoring is to allow you to fix broken (or slow) part later. I insist on ""later"".<p>It is also requiring patience and tenacity in front of the operational team: they will think you are doing nothing (they are right, from their point of view, per the very definition of refactoring).",1318861476

Part of why Python has succeeded in scientific computing is integration of legacy codebases (via f2py or C extensions or...). There are probably man-years of work involved in devising a solution-- which by the time it's complete may be basically irrelevant or, worse, fragment the community. I personally think that going down this rabbit hole (porting 10 years of scientific Python libraries to PyPy) would amount to an exercise in vanity rather than producing the kinds of revolutionary changes to array-oriented computing that need to happen <i>soon</i> to deal with the large-scale data processing challenges of the present and future. Having recently used GPUs to speed up statistical inference algorithms by a factor of 50 or more, I am not that motivated by a JIT beating C in some cases (as Travis wrote: ""C speed is the wrong target""). Many in the SciPy community are convinced that NumPy will not provide the computational foundation that we need going forward, and they are going to step up and start building the next generation NumPy (or whatever it's going to be called). We'd rather have more of the smartest computer scientists in the Python community focused on this problem (building more sophisticated data processing pipelines for use in Python) than on speeding up the Python code that by my estimation doesn't matter that much.",1318861129

Congratulations, I guess, for being the first to patent the idea of authenticating a web app based on a password plus a cookie from a prior session, and requiring additional authentication if the cookie isn't there.  Hard to imagine that that wasn't obvious in 2004, but maybe it just seems that way in retrospect.",1318860126

3120485,comment,3119586,3119586,1,0,lyudmil,,,"There's an implied assumption in this post that handling edge cases or one-off, extreme cases necessarily is done by writing ugly/dirty code. I think the whole point about writing clean code is avoiding the hacky stuff even if the problem is messy. We're in the business of articulating solutions to messy problems clearly enough so that they can be executed by a machine. The best professionals in our field do that, and also make it so that other people can read and understand their work. That's what clean code is to me.<p>Admittedly, there's room for interpretation and a degree of subjectivity here. However, this doesn't prevent us from knowing about what <i>dirty</i> code is and I don't see a compelling reason why we ought to tolerate it (e.g. long functions with a lot of branching are difficult for <i>everyone</i> to read, so you shouldn't have any of those; same goes for badly named variables/functions/classes).",1318860066

Class A amps will have both odd and even-order harmonics but class AB will be mostly even-order. That is both an audible and and electronically quantifiable difference.<p>If you are talking sound reproduction then A vs AB is insignificant because you only see the difference when the amplifier starts distorting. If you are a guitar player who drives an amp to distortion as a matter of course this difference is germane.",1318860018

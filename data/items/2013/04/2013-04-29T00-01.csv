For me, anything like this that slows me down and interrupts my flow with 3-4 seconds of ""click on the error message and add a one-line comment"" is <i>incredibly</i> annoying.<p>Development has several modes. One mode is ""hacking"", just hashing out what you want until it works and is elegant enough as a solution, perhaps changing your mind frequently when you see how it works in practice. Another is ""polishing"", carefully annotating, cleaning up, documenting, burning off loose threads, making sure the test coverage is top notch, etc.<p>The problem is that Go's compile-time strictness lends itself to the ""polishing"" phase, but not to the ""hacking"" phase.",1367197117

5623553,comment,5620842,5622032,8,0,ahoyhere,,,"I've been watching these issues for a long time and here's the conclusion I've come to:<p>Americans care far more about people getting ""what they deserve,"" than caring about costs in the long run. Many of the Americans who have the least will still argue against <i>people like them</i> getting ""free"" things like healthcare -- ""I DON'T HAVE HEALTHCARE, LOOK AT ME, I'M FINE"". Because they believe those other people don't <i>deserve</i> it. On some level, they believe <i>they</i> don't <i>deserve</i> it either. <i>(In America, land of opportunity, you get what you deserve! So if you don't have it already, you don't deserve it, post ergo propter hoc.)</i><p>This also explains why allegedly fiscally conservative Republicans don't support a guaranteed minimum income, because ""those people"" haven't ""earned"" it -- no matter that the uncountable costs to society, and the totally countable costs to the government/taxation system, is much greater when people go poor and raise their children in poverty and in slums.<p>Americans, by and large, are so afraid that one person will get something they don't ""deserve"" that they'd rather punish them, and everyone else, many times over. The opposite of ""Better 10 guilty men go free, than one innocent suffer.""<p>IMO this also explains our ridiculously punitive sentences, instead of simple rehabilitation which is proven to reduce recidivism. ""Why would you give them THERAPY? and GYMS? and let them have PUPPIES? THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN JAIL!"" And why so much (much more than you'd think) of the general spirit seems to be against young women who are raped. And on and on. People obviously must be getting what they deserve, or nothing makes sense about their beliefs about themselves, their country, what they've achieved (or not) in their lives, etc.<p>(I say ""Americans"" because I've lived for years in another country and traveled all over, and this is far from a universal feeling.)<p>Puritannical background at work?

The system is constructed (partially by design and partially due to circumstance, i.e. such scarce resources) such that scientific truth is no longer the goal. The goal now is self preservation and self promotion. The truth today is that it is no longer good enough to ""just"" be a good (or even great) scientist. Now you have to sparkle. Now in order to get postdoc funding you have to show how your science is not just great but also how it links up with industry. Now in order to get hired into a tenure track stream you not only need to have published your PhD work in prestigious journals but you must also show evidence to your hiring university of your ability to attract money. Now in order to get tenure you need much more than ""just"" a solid, respected track record of doing science. You need articles in high-end journals. You need patents. You need links with industry. You need to have been featured in the popular press. You need a track record of attracting money to the university. The more of this you produce, the higher your salary, the more perks you get at your home university.<p>Lots of people excuse the system by saying something like: well, sure, the system has changed, boo hoo, but after you get tenure you can stop being concerned about all the BS and return to just doing good science.<p>The thing is, people don't do that. People build a ""brand"" as a professor-scientist, and as their profile gets higher, so does their salary, so do their perks.<p>At my university, perversely, the highest-profile scientists, with the highest salaries, (1) teach zero. I mean zero. (2) travel 70% of the time away from home base. (3) supervise grad students by, truthfully, farming out the supervision duties to their postdocs, who by the way, often write the grants for the supervisor as a sort of write-of-passage (sic); (4) are trotted out by the university anytime they need to boast about how good the uni is.<p>The system has been twisted so that the goal is to get money and the means to that goal is to publish high-profile papers with simple stories in high-profile journals, and the means to THAT is to ""do science"".<p>The goal ought to be good science, and the means to that ought to be funding (money). It's backwards.<p>PS, I speak from experience, I got my PhD in 1999 and I've been tenured since 2006.

An implication is that we might not know as much as we think we do about the <i>kinds</i> of proteins that bind to DNA, since we're still finding new stuff.  However, for all we know, this protein could work just like one of the known DNA-binding proteins, just using a different protein sequence.  That would be weird, but not exceptionally weird.<p>It's possible that this is a pretty rare find, and that we really do know most of the basic protein structures that bind DNA sequences.

<i>Theres a HUGE amount of upside here. Thats why Garden State grossed $35 million at the box office. Or, put another way: if 350,000 people see this movie in theaters, at $10 a ticket, thats $3.5 million  10% of what Garden State made. If Braff gets $2 per ticket, thats $700,000 right to him.  Wow! </i><p>There is no way that Braff got $2 a ticket.  At $10/ticket, that represents 20% of the top-line grosses (i.e., before expenses and the theater's take), and would represent almost 50% or more of the <i>studio's</i> receipts on the film at today's prices. (When Garden State came out, ticket prices were $2-$3 less, so the alleged $2/ticket amount would be even more obscene. ) Theaters typically receive 1/2 of the ticket amount in the first week or two, and an increasing amount each week thereafter to incentivize theatrical longevity.<p>Studios then divy up the remainder, taking their share and expenses first out of such earnings.  (Actors and directors are generally paid their salaries at the onset of the project and would normally be treated as an expense for the studio to recoup).<p>Some actors are able to negotiate a portion of the net proceeds, and receive those in the unlikely and rare event that the movie company with which they contracted shows a profit.  More preferable, but infinitely more unlikely, is for a star to negotiate a portion of the <i>gross</i> proceeds (i.e., before the Hollywood accounting kicks in).  Zach Braff has never been a big enough star to get that sort of arrangement--that's the sort of deal that even Tom Cruise and Will Smith would be hard-pressed to achieve without serious salary concessions--most actors only ever achieve a portion of the gross if they <i>forgo</i> their salary and participate in principal financing.",1367194588

He seems to think (with ardent passion) that regimes in the middle east fell because ""Twitter made that happen.""<p>Okay, sir. Time to settle down and reel that nonsense back in.<p>He speaks emotionally about things that aren't necessarily tethered to reality and his facts aren't precise, and maybe he has the amnesia of a politician.<p>His message is that prisons are bad, and that we should rethink the manner of punishment we exact on people. His passion is very obviously motivated by personal experience, and that doesn't invalidate his message. Essentially, I agree with him. But. I'm not drinking his kool-ade about ""OMG INTERNETZ.""<p>Yes, I'll entertain his notions about prison being an inefficient and destructive practice that mostly leaves inmates as damaged wrecks, and possibly transforms many into more terrible criminals than they might've been without jail time. But I'm going to take his message with a grain of salt.<p>When I say dangerous, I mean it. He is too new to the internet, to extoll its virtues. In the same talk in which he absolutely RAILS against the privatization of prisons (which is an evil all its own, and yeah I'll agree with his points on that) his next words advocate just haphazardly dumping absolutely anything into the hands of large, corporate, profit-driven nigh-monopolies like Facebook. There's a cognitive dissonance in those two concepts that he very obviously hasn't thought deeply about (and to be fair, maybe he hasn't been given the time yet).<p>Which is surprising, I might add, considering that he's a man who had his mail read by prison staff, his phone calls monitored, and was displaced across 19 prisons during his time served.<p>He needs to acclimate himself with some of the debacles of the recent internet over the past 5 years in particular, and maybe familiarize himself with personalities like Julian Assange. If he can bring himself to understand certain realities about the internet, and how it can enable evil as well as good, maybe he wouldn't be so quick to proclaim that it's some kind of universal salve, which can cure all our ills.",1367194265

He had the choice of abandoning the work or redoing the experiment. But he had already spent a lot of time on the research and was convinced his hypothesis was valid. I said  you know what, I am going to create the data set, he told me.<p>> Sitting at his kitchen table in Groningen, he began typing numbers into his laptop that would give him the outcome he wanted. He knew that the effect he was looking for had to be small in order to be believable; even the most successful psychology experiments rarely yield significant results. The math had to be done in reverse order: the individual attractiveness scores that subjects gave themselves on a 0-7 scale needed to be such that Stapel would get a small but significant difference in the average scores for each of the two conditions he was comparing. He made up individual scores like 4, 5, 3, 3 for subjects who were shown the attractive face. I tried to make it random, which of course was very hard to do, Stapel told me.<p>This sort of misconduct is shockingly common in academia, such that it is often not even seen as misconduct.",1367194153

However, the support is there in case I, or another developer, make a mistake.<p>FWIW, catching future mistakes is definitely not the only thing for which we use Unit Tests. The problem domain is hard, and for every test fixture we&#x27;ve written we&#x27;ve found at least one bug.

You create it by POSTing the original, and the server returns a 201 Created, with a Location header pointing to its new URL. The client can then GET it to download the converted version. The document resource should have a TTL so that it can be pruned from cache.<p>I guess, but it forces the server to store the document somewhere (presumably in RAM). It&#x27;s much easier and cheaper in RAM to answer the POST with the formatted document, and you also spare complexity client-side (only a single HTTP call and only a single location for error handling).

Some things I don&#x27;t unit test:<p>That clicking a particular button fires a particular event. Syntax-wise, setting up the event handler was essentially an assignment, and testing the physical clicking of the button was the job of whomever wrote the operating system&#x27;s GUI system.<p>Similarly, that setting a field actually persists the value. Assignments are easy to get right. They get wrong when I&#x27;m naming my variables poorly. Unless that field is actually a property that is really syntactic-sugar for a method call, in which case it is necessary, so test away.<p>That values adhere to certain type properties. If I have to write a test to check type information at runtime, then I&#x27;m not using the type system in my programming language (be it static or dynamic) correctly.<p>I do not use mocks to be able to test stateful subsystems. The whole mock system creates a maintenance nightmare and makes changing APIs extremely brittle. It&#x27;s far better to have scripting in place to build a base, test system from scratch and walk the program through a set of steps, checking state transitions after each step. In other words, it all becomes on, big, stateless test.<p>The added benefit: such scripts tend to help figure out deployment issues before they happen.<p>I try to use stateless designs for everything. Method calls do not mutate in place, the create a new object and return the results. This is not only safer, it&#x27;s infinitely easier to test, as you automatically have both halves of your state transition, rather than having to clone the initial state before calling the mutating function.",1394121297

7354426,comment,7353767,7353767,13,0,geebee,,,"Some of my my comment here may be a difference in how we view unit tests vs functional or integration tests, and it may also have a lot to do with my use of ruby rather than a language that needs to be compiled.  But I hate having less than 100% test coverage, I find it unsettling.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve often said to sell people on the concept of testing: you&#x27;re already testing.  Guaranteed.  If you&#x27;re writing a complicated method, you&#x27;re almost certainly calling it on the command line and checking output, right?  Well, those things that you&#x27;re writing to check it? save them in a folder called unit tests.  You&#x27;ve probably written some code to ensure that different bits of code work properly together?  Save those in a folder called integration tests.  You may be opening a browser to make sure that the app is behaving the way you expect.  Save those tests in a folder called integration.  All of this would make testing natural, rather than something you impose onto your project that feels contrived and vaguely forced.<p>I will admit that there is some overhead on all of this.  Rather than just typing into a browser and checking the results, you&#x27;ll need to figure out how to automate that process.  Rails makes this quite easy in my opinion, and rails does blur the lines between a few of those categories I mentioned above.  I wouldn&#x27;t worry too much about that - if you&#x27;re writing tests that cover these scenarios, I wouldn&#x27;t bother getting too deep into the semantics of testing.  You&#x27;re good.<p>I run a code coverage tool because I like to see what I haven&#x27;t tested.  Often, it turns out I left some code to rot and forgot about it.  My gut feeling is that code rot is probably the most confusing thing to a new developer, and one of the hardest things to deal with (can I remove this?  should I?)  Leaving around obsolete code is kind of a burn on anyone who comes after you.<p>I have mixed feelings about TDD.  I will say that when things are going swimmingly for me, I am often doing TDD.  But it requires a clarity that I sometimes just don&#x27;t have.  More often, I&#x27;m writing tests and code essentially in parallel with each other (like, write a line of code, write a test, write a line of code, write a test).  I suppose I could reverse them.<p>One last thing - I think that tests, especially the integration tests, should give you a very good sense of what an application does.  In short, if you wanted to give someone a demo of your system, a walk through every case in your integration tests would probably be a very good way to illustrate what it does.",1394121278

The snippet above is the standard idiom.<p>Let&#x27;s say a user mistakenly passes &quot;values=0&quot; instead of &quot;values=[0]&quot;.<p>If you had done:<p><pre><code>    if not values:\n        values = []\n</code></pre>\nThen the code will happily proceed with &quot;values&quot; being an empty list and _silently give incorrect output_ instead of raising an error a couple of lines later.<p>You can make the (very reasonable) argument that this is all the fault of dynamic typing, and if python was just a staticly typed language, the compiler would catch all of this, but that&#x27;s beside the point.<p>Be aware of what you&#x27;re testing if you choose &quot;if var:&quot; instead of &quot;if var is not None:&quot;",1394121179

If you&#x27;re writing highly abstract code, you would likely be amazed at how simply you can write down and prove it&#x27;s behavior. For less abstract code, some formal properties may still be available and provable, some available but difficult to prove and better verified using exhaustivity or probabilistic property checking [0], and finally some are simply unknown.<p>My point is that unit tests are one of the very weakest forms of verification. They should be traded for more powerful techniques at every availability.<p>Availability is, today, still an issue, but this is precisely why dependently typed language research is interesting. In Idris you can write your core code alongside a machine-checked proof of its correctness. You can verify your outside interface by nearly autogenerating an interface fuzzer and checking encode/decode roundtrips or system fixed points. Finally, you can compile the whole thing down to Javascript and deploy it atop Meteor if that&#x27;s your endgame.<p>Idris is just one interesting point on this spectrum.

There are times when you don&#x27;t want to distinguish 0, False, None, or empty. Unlike JS which has <i>==</i> and <i>===</i>, Python only offers <i>==</i> I like that. Coding like <i>!=0</i> is very C like to me, or not taking advantage of Python. In the Python world, it is common and advised to test trutfulness until you have to test the actual value. That is, you can get away with a lot of <i>if object</i> instead of <i>if object.size == 0</i> or <i>if function() == 0</i>, i think you can do this by implementing your own <i>__eq__</i> and <i>__nq__</i> for the object. Imagine someone has multiple values to return depending on the logic branch, the following is arguably ugly and bad, but say it happens:<p><pre><code>   if cond1:\n     return -1\n   elif cond2:\n     return -2\n   elif cond3:\n     return -3\n</code></pre>\nUnless there is a good reason to return these ints, if you only care about the semantic (to distinguish which branch in the caller&#x27;s), just raise your own exception.<p><pre><code>   if cond1:\n     raise cond1Exception\n   elif\n     raise cond2Exception\n</code></pre>\nSo there are ways to go around and make code more readable. is this a bad coding?

7354304,comment,7353767,7353767,69,0,revscat,,,"I&#x27;m back in Java-land these days, which is culturally very pro-unit testing. After getting exposed to it again for a few months again I&#x27;ve come to side with the author here. I&#x27;ve never really been comfortable with the amount of time certain people dedicate to unit testing, especially the TDD crowd, but in my hiatus something has arisen in popularity which has made it all the worse: mockito.<p>Prior to mockito, unit testing was (more or less) limited to testing that your methods behaved as expected, and would occasionally expose NullPointerExceptions or other exceptional conditions. Dependent objects were either simplified or simply ignored.  With the rise of mock object frameworks, however, your tests specifically say &quot;this method on this mock will be called X number of times, with this result&quot;. Mind you, this is all happening in the context of another method call. So, for example, if you were testing the method &quot;calculateDueDate&quot;, and that method took a DateTime object, your test might look like this:<p><pre><code>        @Before\n        public void setup() {\n            MyClass myClass = new MyClass();\n            DateTime mockDateTime = mock(DateTime.class);\n        }   \n\n        @Test\n        public void specificDueDateShouldBeTenDaysFromNow() {\n            DateTime result = myClass.calculateDueDate(mockDateTime);\n            verify(mockDateTime, times(2)).getHour(); // contrived\n        }   \n</code></pre>\nThe problem with this is that the tests become obstacles in the way of refactoring the code. Should you decide that you don&#x27;t want to use the DateTime library any longer you will have to not just change the code which is using it but the tests as well. Or what if, going back to the example above, you decided not to use the getHour() method any more? Every test referencing that will have to be changed. And changing those tests is very likely to be more involved than changing the code under test, because there frequently are more tests than code. This has a negative impact on the design of the application. Because companies rarely dedicate resources to making existing software better purely for its own sake, you tend to have to do what you can when you can. This means your time is limited to make that refactor, or upgrade that library, or do whatevever change it is that needs to be done. Unit tests, especially those that use mocks, can get in the way of this to such an extent as to make such efforts impossible.<p>I think testing is important. I do not, however, share the belief that is the sole, or even primary, determinant of code quality. In fact, an over reliance on unit testing can <i>easily</i> be a net negative. Should unit tests be thrown out? No. Baby with the bathwater and all that. But they should not be viewed as a silver bullet, either. They&#x27;re not. They can help, but they can hurt.",1394120454

These are the facts. On the other hand the kind of problems he described are problems that happen in <i>every</i> mainstream language, either due to the pressure of keeping it stable and of backwards compatibility (you know, real world concerns) or because current languages aren&#x27;t equipped to handle it or because of pragmatic reasons with which he doesn&#x27;t agree with. And in fact, speaking of &quot;<i>academic papers</i>&quot;, some of the problems he cares about can only be fixed for real in languages with dependent types (ever heard of one?).<p>As for &quot;fixing bugs and streamlining the libraries&quot;, if you bothered reading the release notes on Scala 2.11-RC1 before commenting, you would know that this release is exactly about fixing bugs, modularizing the compiler, improved compilation times, streamlining the libraries, eliminating deprecated stuff and so on. By all accounts, it will be an awesome release even though it doesn&#x27;t add features to the language. It won&#x27;t solve all of Paul&#x27;s concerns of course, but there are people that actually care and work on these problems.<p>But then, whenever that happens, people start complaining that Scala breaks backwards compatibility too often. Apparently you can&#x27;t please everybody. And btw, the Scala core devs also have plans for breaking source compatibility by implementing a Go-like source-code migrator to get rid of deprecated syntax sometimes in the future.<p>Most importantly - at the end of that talk, Paul Philips still claims that Scala is his favorite language.

All this is easily available on open public Internet sites.<p>And that&#x27;s me. I make a concerted effort to remain pseudonymous on the Internet. I don&#x27;t have a Facebook. I think you&#x27;d be surprised what people can easily find out about you if they want to.<p>What I do find interesting is the dichotomy between what I perceived to be the HN majority opinion in the story about license plate tracking and this story. In the former, it seemed to me that most people declared that privacy was basically dead and we should get over it; it was perfectly legitimate to collect public data regardless of whether the aggregation of that data led to information that many people would consider an invasion of privacy. Indeed, many commenters justified this point of view by saying that, essentially, data collection didn&#x27;t really introduce any new problems, it just made it easier to get caught lying (e.g. having an affair) which is your fault since you shouldn&#x27;t be doing it anyway.<p>But here many people (perhaps it is entirely a different set of people) clearly feel that the opposite is true: individuals, even those who may be involved in very public projects, have a powerful right to privacy. Or is it just that we feel its OK for companies and individuals to buy and sell information but less OK for the media to publish the same information wholesale? If so, why? At least when the media publishes my information, I know what you know. If people are buying and selling my information, I don&#x27;t know what they know about me, I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing with that information, I don&#x27;t know if its accurate, and I don&#x27;t know how that affects decisions that companies and governments make about me.<p>I especially find the argument that we shouldn&#x27;t publish the information about Satoshi because it puts him at risk interesting. I think most of us dismissed the same arguments when it came to informants identified in the Wikileaks documents.<p>I don&#x27;t buy the &quot;seeking attention&quot; argument: many celebrities and people in positions of power aren&#x27;t seeking attention and fame - it&#x27;s a side effect of the job, or something they have done.

It is complex, verbose, and difficult to reason about without proper language abstractions at appropriate levels. Worse still are machine optimizations obscuring intent as the software evolves, work-around &quot;patterns&quot; for inferior PL designs, and other savageries inflicted upon us. It is highly unlikely you could give a brilliant programmer a few hundred thousand or millions of lines of code and ask them what the program does in an afternoon let alone ask them to find the bug in it.<p><i>Good</i> unit tests provide the specification for a certain low-level of the code to a developer. You will never catch everything but their purpose is not to test for absolute correctness. Their purpose is to specify, for a given range of expected behavior, what the boundaries are. If I write the <i>test first</i> in earnest I am telling my future maintainers what I intended to write. We can execute that intention against what I wrote and make assertions about whether it works as expected. That&#x27;s all I expect unit tests to do.<p>Formal correctness proofs for all possible inputs is way out of my league and beyond the scope of almost every project I&#x27;ve encountered save for automated proof verification software.<p>You should write unit tests and you should write them first. They are the executable specification you will run your program against to ensure your software behaves in the manner in which you intended it to. With solid, well-thought out tests guiding your design you should be able to optimize and refactor your software over time and see that it <i>still</i> behaves as expected in the face of change.

In general, I would refrain from absolute when it comes to motivation science.<p>One practical application that I have found to Moves (one of the tools listed there, and the most used one) is journaling: not really detailing how much calories I have burned, bus simply where I was, and what I’ve done. The integration with FourSquare is great to help me remember “that great little restaurant I when to when I was in Barcelona… was that in June or April?”<p>In my experience — admittedly anecdotal and (I wish on everything that is precious) representative to no one — I torn my knee a year ago: ACL, the very bad kind.

I still couldn&#x27;t barely walk and <i>had</i> to: exercise, as soon and as hard as you can, is the only treatment. Moves really helped me track my every step there, and a dozen stepped counted at the time. I am emotionally quite fragile in general, more so then (because the accident had cost me a good client, delayed an interview with an amazing company, forced my long-distance girlfriend and I to cancel holidays together, ridden me to a windowless bed while Spring was finally out) and the pain… Without that bouncy blue dot proclaiming 360 steps was a ‘Personal record!’ I wouldn’t have gone through it nearly as well. Without the app to track on its own the time it took me to tumble on crutches to my very good, very busy and very time-conscious physical therapist (a block away, that is… 20 minutes the first days), I would have had no idea how to be there on time. Not representative, indeed. Bit not useless.<p>None of the tracking apps that I’ve used have had the expected impact: some revealed to me how my psyche was at stake more than training, some that GPS technology sucks, or that good design is still direly needed… None (with the notable exception of Moves) I’ve used durably, but all have had a positive, eye-opening experience on me.

They just fall into pointless favor-trading and rent-seeking. They see creation for its own sake as self-indulgent, manic, pointless, or (gasp!) <i>effeminate</i>. The result is that motivations like &quot;build cool shit&quot; or &quot;help people&quot; are cast as reckless and irresponsible, vision goes away, and reliable mediocrity becomes the new game of the day. With competing to excel rendered impossible, people compete instead to suffer in pointless social competitions that have a flavor of reality TV.<p>There&#x27;s this negative stereotype that engineers &quot;don&#x27;t want to concern themselves with the business&quot;, and that they&#x27;d rather shut themselves away in an ivory tower and build &quot;cool&quot; stuff that no one cares about. That&#x27;s not true at all! However, they <i>refuse</i> (often passively, because to be active in it leads to professional adversity) to subordinate themselves to the business, especially when the business seems to have no vision, no real purpose for existing, and a cost-cutting mentality that squashes excellence.<p>Often, the only way to get the MBA-culture philistines to do the right thing (and let the creative geniuses shine) is to create a sense of competition and existential crisis. &quot;We have to crush Facebook before they crush us. We need this autonomy for our best people.&quot; Meanwhile, Facebook doesn&#x27;t give a damn about &quot;crushing&quot; anyone.

So it comes down to a question of if we want to allow specific organizations to amass and control huge amounts of resources, and if so, what in return must they guarantee us - how must they benefit us, etc.. ingrained in this could be the idea of accountability and responsibility, and if they don&#x27;t live up to defined expectations then they lose the powers we have allowed them to amass.

In addition to designing and programming a robot made out of Legos to complete missions on a game field, we were asked to design an innovative solution to a real world problem with this year’s theme NATURE’S FURY®.<p>We chose to focus on Flash Flooding as our topic of study after we saw the terrible flooding that occurred in Colorado shortly after the challenge began this Fall.  Soon after that, Austin was hit with heavy rains and we saw the effects of flooding and the unfortunate tragedies from flash floods right in our own town.<p>Despite the current signs and barricades used to warn us of flooded roads, Central Texas still leads the nation in flood related deaths and 75% are vehicle-related at low water crossings. This inspired us to design an automatic flood warning system that would be a great improvement over existing signs and barricades.<p>We took first place in the research portion of the FLL® competition at our Qualifier in December. We recently learned to make blogs in school so in order to get our ideas out to the community and get feedback that may improve our design, the team has created a blog describing our invention, the Flash FLare FLood FLoat (FL4).<p>We would be very grateful if you would take a few minutes to look over our blog and leave a comment with  feedback on our ideas and design. The judges really like to see that the teams have reached out to the community. Our goal is to have 100 comments by Friday night to print and show the judges on Saturday morning so feel free to forward this to anyone you think may like to help us.",1394118479

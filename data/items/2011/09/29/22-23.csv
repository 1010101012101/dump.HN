Right now the reviewers (= designated experts) have all the votes.<p>As I think about it, the reviewers achieved that status because they wrote articles that got upvotes from previous reviewers.  The first reviewers were historical and they set the standards.<p>You could end up with a situation where the reviewers were poorly chosen and so upvote complete bullshit (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair</a>), but fields of science have a reproducibility clause that provides good amounts of self-correction.<p>Hmmm.  I didn't think your boycott post would lead to an examination of the way science and engineering is published, but the time might well be ripe.  That said:  My recommendation is to narrow the scope and focus on the boycott.  It's enough to keep your plate full for a while.",1317337184

Galeo aka Tom Jobim (aka GIG) is located in Rio.<p>For the commentor who got the message in Portuguese, ""Os vos cadastrados no sistema saindo deste Aeroporto com essa durao de viagem ainda esto sendo processados!"" means, ""the flights registered in the system leaving from this airport with that flight time are still being processed"".<p>I use OX Lion and when I use the trackpad with two fingers to scroll the page, the map gets smaller or bigger. A bit annoying. Other than that, with a little work on the UI, I think you have a good idea. I would like to see an alternative with some sort of text-based layout for the flight information, perhaps with dropdown menus, etc. Another idea is to be able to select the departing city <i>and</i> the destination city via the map, at which point the cheapest flights are shown.<p>Also, TAM has (or at least had in 2010) direct flights from MIA to MAO which your site is missing.

3054667,comment,3054516,3054516,1,0,ShawnJG,,,"I would first like to preface this by saying that I think insider trading is wrong. And individuals who blatantly and obviously take advantage of privileged private information for profit should be punished. However for most cases I find that the punishment far outweighs the crime. When bankers and CEOs on Wall Street manipulate the market for their own gains or cause industry crashes based on reckless behavior and ordinary people lose billions of dollars in net worth the Wall Street hotshot get to walk away Scott free. In my opinion I rather have a guy who purchased options on a tip in making money versus reckless money managers who lost his senior citizens entire life savings. The mortgage crisis was completely avoidable and most people agree that what companies did bordered on the illegal yet no one has been prosecuted for crime. These high-profile prosecutions by the SEC seemed to be just a bit of posturing to get the image polished in the news.<p>Martha Stewart and Mark Cuban for both in the same boat, bad knowledge that their investment was about to tank in there were about to lose money. What normal person would sit back and allow their money to go down the drain. Especially when information is not solicited by you. In both cases it seems someone came to them with the information they did not actively seek it out. How could you not act on that tip. I'm not crying for multimillionaires but it's hard to ignore the fact that any normal Joe blow citizen would do any differently. this is exactly the case with the factory workers. The chief mechanical executive was observant of his surroundings and concluded something was up. He was not involved in the deal, no one came to him and give him information, he pieced the puzzle together himself. He should not be penalized for that.<p>The problem is the vagueness of the law. Laws should not be left open for wide speculation and interpretation of said law. Especially in finance, it should be as defined in particular as possible. We definitely should have fair markets, without it Wall Street would evolve into an even more chaotic and corrupt place. The people need to know where they stand and what they can and cannot do.<p>This type of disparity in the law and its enforcement is not unique to the financial industry. Drug laws and penalties vary wildly. The Rockefeller drug laws are some of the most notoriously lopsided legislation that was ever passed. You could do decades for possession of crack but only a few years of probation for the equivalent amount of cocaine.<p>Define the laws, level the playing field and enforce penalties uniformly. It's really just a simple as that.<p>On a funny note the guys who used a Croatian seamstress at the front first tried to hire strippers to solicit tips from bankers while they were partying at a strip club. Illegal, yes but funny as hell.",1317336864

No, my project 1) took less than 48 hours and, 2) while I'm proud of it, it's definitely not technically impressive. It's possible that it's something only a mother could love. Hopefully this convinces you that <i>anyone</i> can build a semi-useful website.<p>URL: http://how-many-calories-are-in.com/<p>The idea was to create a site providing useful information and then the second phase of the plan is to eke out some passive income from advertising. I'm still trying to figure out how I'm going to get the website in front of people, though. Other than sharing it with you fine folks and my whopping 35 twitter followers, I'm thinking maybe I'll email popular food and nutrition blogs and see if I can smooth-talk them into giving the site a shout out. If you have any advice/ideas for generating revenue/page views, let me know.<p>No fancy framework or anything. It's just a static HTML site that I generated from a dataset available from data.gov. The search box is still a little wonky because not all of the pages have been indexed. It was my first stab at using Ruby for something other than solving Project Euler problems, so the scripts I wrote to generate it (and the StackOverflow questions I had to ask) are embarrassing, but the scripts are provided for your amusement at https://github.com/robertseaton/how-many-calories-are-in.com/ and the StackOverflow questions are now a matter of public record. In hindsight, I should have used some type of templating system to separate the code and data, but I figure: if it works, it works. In the future, though: some kind of templating system, definitely. Maybe I'll refactor if I decide to add more to the site.<p>I probably spent about half the weekend writing the dinky scripts to output the site and the other half working on the site's design in an attempt to get it looking like a site that you might trust in giving you correct nutrition information. This is like my second attempt at designing a website. I had no idea what I was doing. I just tweaked the CSS until I found something that looked less horrible.<p>Any feedback is welcome.<p>P.S.

That's not how it works (in the great majority of cases anyway) -- you pay only if your paper is accepted and published.  (So I should have called it a ""publication fee"".)<p>This is an important difference because it means you don't have a situation where someone submits a manuscript, pays the handling fee, and feels the journal <i>owes</i> them positive reviews and publication.<p>Many open-access journals provide waivers for authors without institutional funding.  Typically, editorial staff and reviewers and not informed whether or not the author took a waiver, so that can't influence the accept/reject decision.",1317336081

3054621,comment,3053883,3054457,8,0,Silhouette,,,"I concur entirely (and have spoken with my MP about it).<p>However, as far as I can tell, anyone using any of the more established ""big name"" billing services to collect payments for a UK company is almost certainly breaking at least one law on a ""your business is at risk"" scale. Stripe would have to be very special to do better.<p>The usual culprits are VAT (I have yet to find a billing service that would actually allow a UK business to comply with its basic statutory requirements on this count, including several that claim to support VAT) and privacy (exporting personal data, such as names and credit card details, outside of Europe requires certain guarantees, which again I don't think would be met by any of the services I've looked into so far). I imagine quite a few businesses are getting away with using these services and not meeting their obligations, but personally I wouldn't want to operate with that sort of risk, particularly now Business Record Checks are becoming big news.<p>Stripe does seem to have a fairly clean API, but on the flip side, it also seems very limited in features next to some of the more established competition, so maybe it's just horses for courses. Again, I know that none of the other billing services we've considered this year even got close to supporting the <i>basic</i> charging model we wanted, never mind all the bells and whistles we've been considering, and if you wind up having to do a bunch of financial legwork yourself, these services start to look like very poor value for money pretty quickly.<p>IMHO, what small businesses in the UK really need is for the government to stop hassling banks about lending lots of money (sometimes useful, but not to many of us) and just get them to provide basic services like card payments in a sane manner: no multi-month waits to get up and running, directly comparable charging structures on some standard basis, transparent migration of customer card data between all the vault services without causing a PCI nightmare so there is genuine competition in the market, and so on.<p>And then I woke up. :-)",1317335795

There are parts of this that I actually find kind of compelling. The Ticker is a nod toward ambient intimacy the idea that you can approximate the low-level intimacy of occupying the same space as someone, in a digital way.<p>But, by being public, the Ticker fails at achieving intimacy. Because if being in the same room with someone creates intimacy, being in the same room as everyone creates the opposite. It turns all of your activity into performance. And what many have hinted at is that removing friction from sharing just displaces that friction. If everything I do on the web is under the public gaze, I have to reflect for a moment before I take any action  before I listen to a song, watch a video, play a game, or click on a link. It simply moves the friction from sharing onto the activity, in the worst kind of self-censorial way.</i><p><a href=""http://blog.byjoemoon.com/post/10755504272/intimacy-and-performance-on-facebook"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.byjoemoon.com/post/10755504272/intimacy-and-perf...</a>",1317335610

If you follow the Scala mailing lists you'll find a lot of anti-Spring sentiment, and I totally agree with them. I've hated Spring since I first saw it years ago. Why use a statically typed language if you're going to throw away type  safety for the important task of wiring your application together? Why use a modern and powerful language if you're going to, again for important parts of your application, rely on a horribly slow and gimped XML DSL?<p>One of the reasons I think people still use Spring is that XML configuration files don't require recompilation. I think that to address the Scala developers or community need to make it incredibly easy for you to run Scala scripts as part of your application. This will then allow people to use Scala like a dynamic language and allow them to deploy Scala configuration without needing to recompile.<p>Also, I think work needs to be done in the community to document accepted design patterns one can employ  to wire together your application in Scala in a way that solves all of the use cases Spring configuration is currently used for. This, combined with making it easier to run dynamic Scala, and people will never feel the need to turn to Spring again and the world will be a better place.",1317335498

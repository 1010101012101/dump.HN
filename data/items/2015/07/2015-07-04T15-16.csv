How is this even a solution in a world where a 20Gbps DDOS attack for a few hundred dollars? Real DDOS solutions are still big money only because AWS does not invest to solve this problem on the core network.

There are a few exceptions, but they are illustrative. Consider a rusted on bolt. Can it be moved? Not without a lot of effort. However a fresh new loose bolt of the same kind demonstrates movable-objectness. What about a chair bolted to the floor? It was once loose, it&#x27;s an object. What about a chair welded to the floor? Same thing. What about a chair that&#x27;s constructed of the floor its self, like a large lump or bend up from steel or molded? I would submit that that&#x27;s the floor acting like a chair, and not an object chair, but a chair like part of the floor.<p>An even more technical definition would be along the lines of &quot;Objects are the static locus of continuity within a sharp boundary.&quot; And by static I mean to include floppy objects like plants or leather. And by sharp boundary I mean in relative space to the observer and their understanding of their environment. From the ground a cloud looks like it has a relatively sharp boundary, sure, it&#x27;s complex, but the difference in the color and shading from the sky gives it away. If you&#x27;re IN the cloud it just looks like fog. Is fog an object? Sure, it&#x27;s in high contrast to the regular state of the air. Is air an object? Sure, it&#x27;s in high contrast to the ground, and from a certain perspective interstellar space.<p>Does liver fit this definition? If it&#x27;s separated from the organism, sure. If it&#x27;s still in a living body, it&#x27;s an organ, not an object.<p>>all objects are mind created.<p>I would go even further and say that &quot;All patterns are mind events.&quot;<p>Phurpa drop!<p>(A phurpa is a triple sided ritual dagger which in Buddhism symbolizes the slaying or destruction of foe or obstructions.)",1436024411

9830440,comment,9825805,9829724,0,0,nadams,,,"> Yes there is - the ability to verify identity and hence actually prevent MITM attacks.<p>In asymmetric encryption - we both will generate a public/private key pair. We can walk up to each other, exchange USB drives containing public keys, and now we can communicate securely. We have just created a secure connection without a certificate.<p>All the CA is a middle guy that says &quot;Oh you want to talk to someone claiming to be Alice? Get their public key and I&#x27;ll verify it as I know Alice.&quot; But really how do you trust that middle guy?<p>> And in most cases where an attacker has access to read a network, they can write to it, too.<p>Well maybe - put it into context. If a wifi system is open - it&#x27;s extremely easy to sniff packets (shown by the success of Firesheep). ARP spoofing and other tricks are more complicated - but less likely to happen (someone would have to prop this on a table and it would be a dead giveaway that they are up to no good [1]).<p>> You can&#x27;t ignore key distribution no matter how annoying it is.<p>I&#x27;m not ignoring it - I just want to shift it from having central CAs that can sign certificates for any domain (superfish anyone?) to CA certificates that can only sign for specific domains. Perhaps the CA certificate could be stored in DNS (even glued to the domain like NS records are)? Perhaps we keep the current CAs but force them to allow them to sign a CA cert that is restricted to a certain domain (for free or next to free)?<p>> If a CA issues a false cert, that becomes a mathematical fact, and the CA gets revoked.<p>That doesn&#x27;t matter - if I&#x27;m a bad guy and find this I know I would only have a limited time before it&#x27;s discovered. So, if I&#x27;m a smart bad guy I find a targeted attack, get the bad certificate and do my attack. By the time people figure out what happened - my attack is over and I got what I wanted. Just think of the amount of damage that could be done in a busy place with free wifi and a bad gmail.com certificate. I&#x27;m waiting for the day that happens and everyone can&#x27;t understand why their [insert service provider] account was compromised...<p>> Security here is simply not a binary thing.<p>I never said it was - but the current system is broken [2] [3] [4] [5].

9830422,comment,9829986,9829986,0,0,Kaali,,,"Node.js is in an interesting position. There is a lot of libraries and new ones are coming out at breakneck speeds. It&#x27;s also a way for frontend developers to transition to backend tasks. And it gets a lot of mindshare at the moment, with MongoDB and microservices.<p>But in my opinion a lot of Node.js ecosystem is a lot of mismarketed features. Many developers doing backend services with Node.js actually think that it&#x27;s the fastest thing available, even though multiple benchmarks, e.g. techempower, shows that it really isn&#x27;t. And even more people seem to think that it is a way to do simple parallellism, so they won&#x27;t have to understand threads and locking, which are really complicated stuff. But as many have said here, Node.js does not support threads, or parallelism without running multiple different processes. Which can be fine if you don&#x27;t have any shared state between your processes. And with no parallelism in process, it is quite easy to actually block the event loop by running anything that is CPU and not IO bound. This can be a loop that is too long, too much math, or even parsing a JSON string without using streams. All of these can block the event loop, which means that no requests are going through that process while one request is parsin a JSON.<p>And even though there is a lot of libraries and frameworks for it. The quality is often really, really bad. As in invalid MD5 algorithm bad, etc. But there are also some gems such as Bluebird for promises, which makes the callback hell more easier to handle.<p>You will also face immature debug support, profiling and static analysis. You barely get any refactoring help from your tools, even though IntelliJ IDEA does quite a good job with basic refactoring and debugging. And you will have to spend time with handling odd bugs with no logs showing up on crash, or stuck processes when something has gone really wrong in the code, with no way of knowing (if you don&#x27;t have DTrace) where the code is stuck.<p>But there are stuff Node.js seems to excel at. It is really quick for creating a simple REST service, feedback loop is really quick as the services restart almost immediately (at least when you don&#x27;t use all the latest ES6 transpilers). And if you want to create isomorphic applications, where the server can render a Javascript site on behalf of the browser for the first request, or even successive requests for mobile use, there is no better platform than Node.js. And if you know that you will not do anything that is CPU bound, just IO bound stuff, you can still use any library available. Where for example in Java or Python, you would have to find specific libraries that support your chosen async IO framework.<p>I would use Node.js between a backend server done in a more robust ecosystem such as JVM, and the browser. Where Node.js gets the data from the backend and does it&#x27;s magic with isomorphic React for the client.",1436023628

You still have to apply protection to them but don&#x27;t have whole Internet coming after you with protocols that aid attackers more than defenders. My method is typically to obfuscate identifiers for Internet services and use methods like authentication at packet level (eg port-knocking or VPN). The configuration details are sent over the non-Internet medium. Even dial-up can move basic credentials and some I.P. addresses quickly. Don&#x27;t need to do it often, either. If you hide it (eg SILENTKNOCK), attackers start getting pretty pissed and desperate wondering why not a single packet gets through.<p>This method is primarily for intranet sites, though. Web sites or apps facing the public naturally are at high risk. Best to just use Cloudfare or a similar service along with hiring good security folks.",1436023045

It puts me in a fury, like some sort of creative berserker. I like watching it to conjure that feeling.<p>At the core it&#x27;s Jodo&#x27;s intensity that I love. He approaches every part of making this movie like it&#x27;s the most important thing in the world and gets everyone around him to rise to that challenge.<p>His ability to put together a team of world-class people was also inspiring. I have tremendous respect for everyone he picked but I also find the subtext of his quest fascinating. It&#x27;s never overtly mentioned but each person he convinces to join has a desire that he exploits. Pink Floyd wants fame, Dali wants money, Orson Welles wants food, etc. There&#x27;s something powerful about aligning a creative team while being conscious of each individual&#x27;s desires.<p>There are many great quotes throughout the movie. Two stick out: &quot;Have the greatest ambition possible&quot; which is always worth reminding yourself of. The second occurs near the end, when he realizes the movie won&#x27;t get made. I forget the exact words, but roughly: &quot;We make the movie: GREAT. We don&#x27;t make the movie: GREAT.&quot; We all suffer crushing defeats, when something we wanted doesn&#x27;t happen. I love that Jodorowsky approaches this failure with equal creative intensity, and drives that creativity into new outlets (e.g. The Incal). It&#x27;s a great philosophy for dealing with failure.<p>There&#x27;s a lot more I love about the doc, but I&#x27;ll end on a personal note.

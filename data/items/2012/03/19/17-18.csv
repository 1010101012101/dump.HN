At the same time, he suggested that it was he felt it was his best work yet.  I suspect that he really feared the disintegration of 'his best work' when the lies were uncovered, and his supposed fear of un-doing the 'good' his story has done was really just another layer of justification.

3725212,comment,3720332,3722439,1,0,pmjordan,,,"I think the effectiveness of lectures might depend on the student as much as the lecturer.<p>I can remember some lectures (6-10 years ago) and their content quite vividly, even if they were fairly unidirectional and to large audiences. I find that if I start looking up something that was explained in a lecture, it will trigger the memory of the lecture, even if I couldn't recall it previously. This almost never happens for things I learned from books or the internet - if I've forgotten them, I have to relearn them. It also seems to take me much longer to understand something from a written explanation.[1]<p>I can only assume it's to do with multi-sensory input having easier access to long-term memory. And maybe there's an emotional element, too: reading a (factual) book is an emotionally neutral experience. That's not the case when you're watching and listening to a human.<p>And I'm sure the effect is more pronounced in some than in others. Many other students in my year did very well despite missing lots of lectures; I think I missed about 5 of what must have been about 2000 and would have needed to do vastly more revision to pass exams. I suspect I would have dropped out of university if it hadn't been for lectures. As it turns out, I had essentially zero intrinsic passion for my subject (physics), but the good lecturers made it interesting.<p>[1] I realise this is anecdotal and hard to verify. The most direct comparison I can think of is this: I remember that when trying to catch up after a lecture I missed, it took me much longer than the 50 minutes to understand the covered subject matter using the blackboard notes and reference books.",1332179831

Not-space. (At least the X-37 is up there spyingflying.)<p>The orbital space plane program, the one that was Sean O'Keefe's thing - neat plans, more capsules than planes IIRC, but ultimately we got not-space from it.<p>The Vision for Space Exploration, under Michael Griffin? Rocket designs that were approximately equivalent to throwing your astronauts into a paint mixer. A system about which the review panel said that ""If they gave us the system on a silver platter, the first thing we'd have to do is cancel it, because we couldn't afford the ongoing costs."" A lot of money, a launch pad rusting in the Florida weather, and a whole lot of not-space.<p>And for all the money we spend on human spaceflight, we now send Astronauts up as passengers in Soyuz rockets.<p>Now we're spending $18 billion dollars - figure subject to change, always upward - to build the SLS - the Senate Launch System. (Another estimate has it at $40B for development and the first 4 flights.) If all things go as planned, it will launch once every two years, launching an unmanned trip around the moon in 2017 and a manned trip to the moon in 2019. Schedule subject to change - always slipping.<p>Does anyone thing that SLS has a chance of working? Or is it just going to become another not-space program?<p>How about the replacement for the Hubble Space Telescope, the Webb Space Telescope? In 1997, it was going to be launched in 2007, and it was going to have cost 500 million dollars. Now we've spent 3.5 billion on it, and it will launch in 2018. Maybe. That's a ton of money to spend on not-space - and it's money that's been taken away from the moderately successful bits of NASA, like the Mars program, which doesn't have a mission in it after 2013's MAVEN.<p>I don't mind spending money on space. I like space. I've been following the MER rovers for nearly a decade. I think COTS and Commercial Crew are brilliant, and hope that they will continue to exist with a program structure that rewards results, rather than existence. Commercial space is the last best hope to get a domestic space capability.<p>But times are tight. We're massively overspending as is - borrowing tons of money our grandchildren will still be paying back. So increased spending is far from free.<p>Is it worth it? I say yes. Spend money on space. Where do we get that money? Let's stop spending it on not-space, like we have been.",1332179798

No problems.  In a few cases a spill might result.  Fires are only a factor when gasoline vapors are involved.<p>If a pure electric vehicle has a range equivalent to that of a gasoline-powered vehicle, say, 200 to 300 miles, this means that it is storing a tremendous amount of energy.  Also, due to i-squared-c losses it is very likely that the system will be a high voltage system (hundreds of volts).<p>In the case of a bad accident this energy could be released violently. There might come a day when we hear of an entire family electrocuted to death in their car after a crash.  I hope this never happens, but I have a feeling it could.<p>As I see it this is the PR problem with the technology: Huge amounts of energy that could do serious damage if something goes wrong.  In contrast to that, a gas tank is a relatively harmless device.<p>Yes, there are safety measures that can and are being utilized, like fusible links between batteries and intelligent management systems.  Still, it doesn't take much at, say, 500 volts, to cause a lot of damage quickly.  As someone who has worked with and designed very high power DC motor controls and have tested many designs to destruction I have to say that this is an area that really needs to receive a tremendous amount of attention.<p>The last thing the industry needs is the media devoting weeks to cover how a family got fried in their electric car while the fire department was powerless to aid them until the batteries fully discharged (which could take a long time).  That would be a truly horrific sight to behold and a potential industry-killing event.  Close your eyes and imagine that for a moment.  Then imagine trying to convince someone who saw that on TV to buy an electric car.<p>Super-capacitors could help in this regard in very meaningful ways.  If we could get battery packs to be small enough that leaves a lot of room for creating a crash and intrusion protection barrier around the battery.<p>Today battery packs are very large and heavy.  And, while I am sure that a lot of work has gone into safety, they could be made far safer if the batteries had higher energy capacities.<p>The other way super capacitors might be able to help could be as paradigm shift enablers.  Picture the case of not needing a range of 300 miles.  For most of us, 60 miles might be enough.  If that battery pack is small enough gas stations could morph into battery pack swap stations.  The fact that a super-capacitor has a useful life of tens of thousands of cycles means that there would be no concern of receiving someone's almost-dead battery.  The cost of re-fueling would include some amount of money to deal with packs near or at their end of life.  If you did need to go farther maybe cars could be designed with room for a second range-extension pack or some other means to connect a larger battery pack.<p>From a safety standpoint, I want to see the kinds of tests companies like Volvo and Mercedes are known for:  Fling a car through the air and roll it multiple times.

GCC also supports more languages and architectures than Clang which simply mirrors the needs of Apple (ObjC, C, C++). If you are on OSX then yes, there's likely little reason for you to use GCC since OSX ships with a (5 year?) old GCC version and also obviously because Clang/LLVM integrates much better with Apple's proprietary XCode.<p>That said I use both, and at work we test our code against both toolchains (and some other compilers aswell).

Their research has spurred similar analyses around the world, much of which is in the World Top Income Database, <a href=""http://184.168.89.58/sketch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://184.168.89.58/sketch/</a>. It is based on income tax filings, which correspond to the tax unit for each country. In the US, that would be by household.<p>You prefer talking about consumption inequality, I prefer talking about wealth inequality, but the best data that we have is for income inequality hence the choice in this plot. The defect with measuring income inequality is that it does not directly correspond to each individual's ability to bear the tax burden, which leads to issues of tax fairness. The issue with consumption inequality is that the fraction of income consumed tends to decline with increasing income, so this metric is even less tied to an individual's ability to bear the tax burden.<p>2. I think you are greatly overstating the importance of the 1986 Tax Reform Act. During the period covered by this plot, the income tax essentially went from \n- a low revenue elite tax \n- to wartime tax grabs of greater than 70% of income, \n- to a permanent tax on the middle class with top marginal rates above 85%, \n- to a tax allowing a plethora of deductions, \n- to one with our current Reaganesque rates. \nThere have been huge changes over the years, which are mostly captured in these plots.<p>3. Income inequality has been rising in many countries, although this is closely related to reductions in top marginal tax rates in each country. It is also related to tax avoidance and treaty shopping by multinationals in a global economy.<p>In addition to income tax rates, other things that affect income inequality include longevity, birth rates, and the effectiveness of estate taxes since wealth is usually divided amongst children. Also important are capital gains taxes and tax sheltering.<p>Right now, many modern countries are in a bizarre position where the incidence of income taxes, i.e. tax on net change in wealth per year) is higher on the middle class than on the very wealthy who have greater opportunities to take deductions, reclassify, and move income.",1332179092

For example the words ""a very long time"" conjures up some concept for a reader -- but when a listener hears ""a very long time"" from an old person versus a young person they may hear those as two different things. It's important and possibly absent information here that ""if [you] didn't say it, [you] didn't say it.""

3725054,comment,3723080,3724659,2,0,tmhedberg,,,"<i>Currying isn't a big deal for python programmers. The article fails precisely because it makes currying into a big deal.</i><p>I wasn't trying to imply that currying is a big deal for most Python programmers, nor do I agree that the article was. But I think it's probably safe to say that many Python programmers aren't familiar with it or how it can be effectively put to use, since in Python, it's a neat, occasionally useful technique, but isn't exactly ""central"" to the language. For whatever reason, Python also tends to attract a lot of beginner programmers, who probably haven't had enough experience to be exposed to functional techniques. I interpreted the article as targeting that kind of audience.<p><i>This is yet another example of how haskell got it wrong. Currying isn't something that one should do all the time or think about, so basing a language on it is dumb. (And that's true even if we ignore the complications that it adds to polymorphism.)</i><p>Disclaimer: I like Haskell a lot, so you should probably take my opinion with a grain of salt. I'm not trying to start an argument, just expressing a counter-opinion.<p>From my point of view, Haskell's ""currying by default"" approach gives you what is essentially a superset of the functionality available in most other languages, while taking away very little. It's fine to think of `f a b c` in Haskell as being equivalent to `f(a, b, c)` in Python, even though we know that, under the hood, f isn't really a function of 3 arguments. It has the same behavior as the Python version if you always fully apply it to all 3 arguments, though (ignoring strictness). But of course, Haskell conveniently allows you to partially apply f without requiring any extra effort on your part. At least Python gives you the functools library module to make that sort of thing easier; most languages don't even do that.<p>What does automatic currying take away? Well, as you alluded, function polymorphism based on the length of the argument list isn't as straightforward as it is in, say, Java, since Haskell functions really only have a single argument, period. But if you <i>really</i> want the ability to do this kind of overloading, it can be accomplished using type classes. And Python's optional/keyword arguments can be emulated using record syntax. It's just not particularly common to use these techniques, because most of the time there are much more idiomatic ways of accomplishing the things you might use function overloading for in a different language.<p>I'd be interested to hear what else you think is lost as a result of automatic currying. It's difficult for me to come up with anything other than benefits, but maybe I am being blinded by my enthusiasm for the language.",1332178473

He writes: ""The first cipher I'd suggest you consider besides bcrypt is PBKDF2.""<p>PBKDF2 is not a cipher.  It's a KDF, and it's almost always used with an HMAC or a cryptographic hash rather than a cipher.  The thesis of this article seems to be ""PBKDF2 is well understood, where bcrypt is not.""  In fact, the opposite is probably true.<p>bcrypt uses a block cipher (blowfish) to create its underlying compression function.  Block ciphers are extremely well understood, have been studied to death for years, and are modeled on extremely well understood constructs.  They can be used to create cryptographic hash functions, but usually aren't, because they're slow (which we don't care about in this case).<p>Cryptographic hash functions, by contrast, are not well understood at all.  They are ""magic"" in many ways, and aren't modeled after anything.  Many more ""bad things"" happen in this space than in the block cipher space.  The only reason people mess with them at all is because they're faster than block ciphers, which again, we don't care about in this case.<p>The other appeal to PBKDF2 is because it ""comes from RSA.""  This doesn't feel like an extremely compelling argument, but if we were going to believe it, then why not use the PKCS#12 KDF?  PBKDF2 was proposed in PKCS#5, and ""12"" is a larger number than ""5"", so if we're going to do what RSA tells us we should do, they're essentially saying we shouldn't actually use PBKDF2.",1332178122

Kitify makes it easy for DIY project writers to document, share and sell kits for their projects. I built Kitify because DIY is fun and a great way to learn, but actually getting the parts together for many projects is a pain; I want to solve that.<p>This is my first Rails project. I knew how to write simple PHP scripts before this, but I had no exposure to Rails - or MVC or, actually, anything meaningfully involving objects. I had the idea for Kitify months ago, but wasn't able to move it forward with the knowledge I had.<p>What really helped was finding a great, smart developer and asking him to write just the basic outline of the app and answer questions about it. I don't mean ""rails new"", I mean a working version with almost no features but with Bootstrap, useful gems, JS utility functions, models/views/controllers in the general direction of what I would eventually need. (Thank you @reedlauber!)<p>This was affordable and time-efficient, and gave me enough momentum to start learning and building.

3724957,comment,3722100,3722803,5,0,robomartin,,,"> All of their glories and all of their accomplishments have taken place within the bosom of the government.<p>I can only agree.  I haven't had the opportunity to socialize with a lot of folks who've lived their entire adult lives under the umbrella of government jobs or highly unionized jobs.<p>As things have it, I recently did have that chance.  I had dinner with a married couple, both of whom have worked government jobs since, well, forever.<p>I have to say that it was a real jolting experience.  It was truly like talking with people from another country, if not another planet.<p>My take was that the framework (union and/or government) creates such a layer of isolation from what I'll call real life that it creates a highly distorted view of reality (in my opinion) for those within it.<p>A recent example I heard about was that of a librarian that,  after working for some 15 or 20 years earning $100K to $120K per annum (with insane benefits) will retire at a very young age with a pension paying her nearly $250K per year for the rest of her life (and retain such bennies as amazing health-care coverage).  This is due to a rule in the contract of many unions that causes pension pay to be calculated on a salary that can be ""spiked"", as they put it, during the last couple of years by taking courses and doing things that, again, by union rules, count towards the salary calculation.<p>You can fully expect someone like that to have a completely skewed view of reality.  Few private citizens, entrepreneurs and small business people have the opportunity to earn $250K a year with such good benefits, much less retain that for the rest of their lives while doing no work whatsoever.  And, for good reason:  In the real world that is almost always mathematically not sustainable.  There are very few circumstances that allow a business to provide 90% pay --forever-- to retiring employees while having to hire a replacement.  It's a case of simply arithmetic.<p>I firmly believe that this kind of thing, this kind of sub-culture, if you will, is really bad for this country (and any country that supports it).  I don't know the internals of Greece, yet from outside it seems that it may very well be an extreme example of this effect.  This is a case where millions of people live in a state that is so incomprehensibly shielded from reality that it, effectively, causes a devolving of potentially valuable human capital.  In some cases this effect crosses generational gaps (""union towns"" or ""government towns"").  By ""devolving"" I mean that the removal of the need to fight for survival devolves a human being into an automaton of sorts that will spend decades working within a system that does not compensate or require excellence.  Mere participation is all that is needed and the rest of your life is covered.  One has to wonder what some of these folks may have been capable of had they been challenged to be better than that.  Hence my use of the term ""devolve"".<p>I didn't want to inject politics into the SpaceX discussion, but I think Aldrin, et al. have done this themselves.  As highly accomplished and intelligent as they are (I don't see them as ""trained monkeys"" as someone said earlier) it is true that they lived their entire lives within this altered-reality that government and union frameworks can and do create.  That, I've concluded, perhaps unfairly, isn't good for the human condition.",1332177550

3724925,comment,3720332,3721777,1,0,philwelch,,,"Your last paragraph about Zidane is interesting. Keeping possession is a bigger tactical advantage than many people previously thought. Imagine an entire <i>team</i> playing keep-away for the win, patiently building up to goals confident they will get them, and you essentially have Barcelona: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6A_K8oWqfk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6A_K8oWqfk</a><p>Zidane was more of an attacking midfielder, which makes his contributions all the more obvious, but even Zidane himself knew that the core of a great team was as far back as the often unheralded position of defensive midfield. When his club Real Madrid sold Claude Makelele and bought David Beckham, Zidane remarked, ""Why put another layer of gold paint on the Bentley when you are losing the entire engine?""<p>Despite the presence of more heralded players like Xavi, Iniesta, and Messi, Busquets is likewise the tactical centerpiece of Barcelona, almost purely due to his intelligence on the pitch. In defense, he drops back and positions himself to intercept passes rather than challenging for the ball, and once he has it he almost always makes the right decision where to put it next. And when Barcelona have possession, he pushes forward to form a triangle with the rest of the midfield, providing an open outlet to maintain possession and recycle it. If you chart out the passes Barcelona make in a typical match, there's usually a very heavy triangle between Xavi, Iniesta, and Busquets.<p>The most interesting part of Barcelona's tactic, though, is the way they seem to push even more players into the midfield. Their notional striker is Messi, but in his ""false nine"" role he plays closer to attacking midfield. Likewise, Barcelona's defenders push forward and hold a very high line.  Defensive midfielders like Mascherano and even Busquets have been repurposed to play as central defenders, while Pique can make effective runs forward. Right-back Dani Alves usually rushes forward to play as a winger.<p>The interesting thing about Barcelona's style of play is that, while it's obviously a tactic well suited for a team full of good passers who have played with each other mostly since childhood, it can be surprisingly effective for other teams. Swansea have used it very effectively in the Premier League this season, while Borussia Mnchengladbach have gone from near-relegation to the Champions League places: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAx9kYx8qo4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAx9kYx8qo4</a>",1332177324

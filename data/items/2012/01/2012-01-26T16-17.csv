The problem is public transport largely stops at midnight (apart from night buses).<p>Not to mention that automobile traffic strangles the bus lines. Bank (Zone 1) and Manor House (Zone 2/3) are approximately 5 miles apart. The 141 bus runs a direct route between them. On a good day, the journey takes 45 minutes. Taking the tube (Northern Line -> Piccadilly) will hardly shave any time off the journey and turn it into an unpleasant, claustrophobic experience.<p>The decision to cut down the congestion zone and divert a lane from an East-West artery for the Olympics is sure to make public transport just peachy.",1327597178

3514835,comment,3513060,3513582,1,0,kls,,,"I disagree, a fair majority of developers fall within the INTP or INTJ classification of Myers-briggs. both of which like to analyze a situation before they would consider answering. Specifically, the INTJ classification is filtered heavily at the whiteboard because of their Judging trait. INTJ's know what they don't know, and if they don't they are going to stop to find a resource that can provide that portion of the answer. Due to the INT part of their profile, they are not going to look at anyone in that room as a potential authority for that answer and therefore they will feel research is needed. This can cause a situation in which an INTJ can basically lock-up. They know they don't know a portion of the answer, and they have none of the natural authorities to look to, to resolve the answer so that they can move on. This can happen on something as simple as forgetting an API method or the modulus operator.<p>No matter how much interviewers say they are just looking for solutioning, they are not being honest with themselves because when they see code that is not their style or they see someone make stupid mistakes (which we all do) on the whiteboard, it embeds in the mind. It such an overpowering signal that it outweighs all other evidence. An INT already knows this and would therefore prefer to present finished code, not how you get there, which finished code is all that really matters, you can walk them through how they arrived at the finished code, and they will have a far more competent answer because they are not trying to code and drag people along with them at the same time.<p>Even if a developer makes 20 mistakes, and uses the compiler/debugger to catch them, then fixes them, if the code that they are going to check in is always clean, is his process bad? on the whiteboard it is, but for me personally if said hypothetical coder never checked in a mistake, he would be my top pick. There are just too many failure points for me to recommend the whiteboard. I believe that they provide no use in an interview and I believe they hurt companies more that employees.<p>Organizations that utilize the whiteboard are doing themselves a disservice because they are setting introverted people up in a situation where a portion of them are naturally going to fail, in a situation that send such a strong false signal that all other evidence is negated. Then some of them are complaining that they cannot find talent. If a company is whiteboarding then they are filtering INTJ's out no two ways about it. As such, they are filtering out a lot of people that combine technical skills with creativity.",1327596951

At first, I was excited by the experience of working with computers.  When I got access to a special computer lab in college that had Suns with big monitors, I used to go there and program just to use the computers.   I loved the excitement of learning new commands, playing with different desktop managers, mastering various editors.  All of it was in service of programming, but it was fun on its own.<p>B. As that stage faded, I was excited by specific technologies (Java! XML! Whatever!).  During this phase, I would write something in one language, or using one technology, and then get excited about re-writing it in a different language or using a different technology.<p>C. The final, and most lasting, phase for me was getting excited about the problems I work on.  Now, the hardware and the technologies have become tools for me, but the problems are infinitely interesting.  What excites me most is working on problems that I believe matter.<p>Of course, I sometimes go back to stage B (MongoDB! AWS!) or maybe even stage A (general purpose GPU programming!), but mostly its stage C that keeps me passionate.",1327595300

3514696,comment,3514176,3514176,28,0,T-hawk,,,"I'm going to cast a dissenting vote from the other comments here and say yes.<p>The golden age of my personal programming experiences was around 1993, during high school.  After outgrowing GW-Basic, I was hacking around in x86 assembly language, figuring out how to program DOS graphical games by manipulating VGA hardware registers.  My tutors were library books on x86 assembler and instructional text files gleaned from local BBSes.  (I still have and treasure those resources to this day.  Michael Abrash was my god.)  I was able, by myself, to produce programs as technically intricate and graphically rich as industry-leading fare like Commander Keen or Epic Pinball, in pure assembly language.  (I never actually made anything beyond tech demo stages into an actual marketable game.)<p>This was <i>magic</i>.  Not a single other person I'd ever met in my life or even on local BBSes across my entire area code had that sort of capability.  This awed even non-techies, whose pinnacle of computer experience was somewhere between Solitaire and Minesweeper.  I had a mini-career programming BBS advertisements for inclusion in zip files, putting out some neat and impressive graphical effects in 2k or so of assembler code.  My favorite trick was to include what appeared to be a custom font in these tiny executables - done by copying the BIOS ROM font at runtime and applying some bitmap transformations to each letter.  I even wrote my own mini sound engine for the Adlib FM-synthesis registers.<p>Nowadays?  Grab a Flash development tutorial and you can do in a week what I spent most of high school learning and doing.  Everything is possible in programming and everybody knows it and every answer is seconds away.  There's no feeling of exploration and achievement.  There's certainly achievement in building a business or product, but not in the programming itself, which now serves as the drudgerous means to an end.<p>The connectivity of the Internet has eliminated local maxima.  I was in high school by an order of magnitude the smartest programmer I'd ever met, but I'm thoroughly average in the Internet world.  I've never been motivated to strike out building my own cool software or startup since nothing's ever come to me that could recapture the magic of my early days of DOS VGA assembly discovery and programming.<p>All the cool technology and companies now are about <i>connectivity</i>, starting with Google and its primal concept of page rank and link juice.  Facebook and its world-squared size social graph.  Ebay the world-squared size marketplace.  Apple and its million-strong app store.  Dropbox and its seamless cloud connectivity.  You can't program anything meaningful and novel in and of itself; programs are now defined by what they interact with.  Some do find scalability and connectivity exciting, but not me.  You can certainly produce scintillating <i>results</i> with modern resources, but for me it's always been about the journey not the goal, and the journey of modern programming is, for me, essentially drudgery.",1327595189

But I have a preference for more DIYability and less interest in interfacing with APIs and cloud services, which isn't necessarily the Correct preference, but is one.<p>Games? Meh, I keep up on recent games in part because it's my job (oddly enough), but listing my top-10 favorite games, Minecraft is the only post-2000 one I can think of. In general I think they've gotten worse, mostly by focusing way too much on graphical fidelity. Even MMOs are like MUDs v 2.0, and I think in many ways haven't recaptured the depth of community and user-generated content that MUDs/MOOs had, but I admit that you can make a case either way (and Eve Online's community in particular is arguably something new in terms of multiplayer dynamics). And mobile and Facebook gaming seems to consist largely of cloning 80s and 90s games...<p>And the web is just recently catching up to the level of interactivity we had on 1980s networked computer systems, which mostly got thrown out in favor of a pile of hyperlinked documents (plus, later, Flash)... its main advantage is increasing visibility in business and society, so you can do things like buy plane tickets on it, which would've been completely <i>possible</i> with 1980s technology but didn't have the business case for it.<p>I do find workable crowdsourcing, with Wikipedia as the main successful example, to be a very interesting para-technological development, probably an emergent effect of internet connectivity. I guess that ties into whether you fundamentally find the ability to reach millions of people (as you mentioned) interesting. I think it is to some extent, but I think it's also become <i>harder</i> to reach 20-50 people in a meaningful, sustained way; things are much flatter, and recreating something like a BBS community is quite hard (though not impossible). Technologically speaking, I don't <i>really</i> find millions of people necessary; doing interesting things that impresses a few dozen people who engage with it meaningfully (rather than just clicking through off Reddit or HN for a few minutes) is satisfying enough.",1327594758

They took me to the top of the Swayambhunath Buddhist complex, in Kathmandu. I was told that this was the Monkey Temple. As a monk translated the wishes of the holy monkeys, I discovered that I was required to rewrite the OS of their ancient computer, which had failed to reboot, back in 1839. Since then, they had searched the world for a programmer competent to handle the situation. They were about to give up, as they stumbled onto me, and realized that I was the reincarnation of ChiChu Gomptar, the lead programmer for the CS monkey gang, which had served their monkey king, the creator of this computer. I was flummoxed by its design, as it was made of smooth stones, uniform beads, colored sand, and wooden levers inlaid with gold. I told them that I couldn't remember anything from my past life. They gave me something to smoke, saying that it would connect me, through the eternal ether, to my previous memories.<p>It did, and after 25 days of extreme programming, of which I recall no details, I had completed the monumental task. I stood up, and ceremoniously dropped the special IPL bead onto the machine, which then awoke from its 170-year slumber with a mighty roar. The holy monkeys were pleased. They handed over a small golden box, with mysterious carvings. It seemed empty, and I was told not to open it unless my circumstances had become truly dire. I thanked them, both for the box, and for the tremendous experience. Unfortunately, I was not able to sell them continued maintenance for their new OS, but that was mostly due to their language not having the word ""maintenance"". Anyway, I have those memories, and this box to use when things go really bad, plus the always-present hope of future adventure.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swayambhunath"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swayambhunath</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_Program_Load"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_Program_Load</a>",1327594393

Even at such low revenue, we owed everything to them for allowing us to get our first product off of the ground and finding value in our service for so many years. It was a VERY difficult decision.<p>We did not make a move until we had a very good transition process for all of our customers. We set up a partnership with Campaign Monitor so each customer could easily migrate their lists and avoid any downtime in sending emails. Sure, it is a pain to export and import lists, but there are many good options out there such as Campaign Monitor. If your electric company shut off your service you would surely be screwed, not really the same case here.<p>Regarding Postmark, this should make you feel even more confident about it. We've seen amazing growth and our team is so passionate about Postmark that we decided it was worth giving up profits on Newsberry to make it even better. That says a lot about our commitment to our other products and our focus as a team.<p>In the history of Wildbit there were many times when we could have just added a few employees to keep profits going in one area while we worked on something else. A perfect example is when we decided to drop consulting to focus on products. We could have kept it going along side of products, but focus is everything in business if you want to create something that people really love and enjoy to use.",1327594389

Your idea of freedom changes when you live in a walkable area and realize that you don't have to rely on anything other than yourself to get you to most things in life.",1327593872

At the time, javascript was a joke, fragmented, language and was not used on the front end that much, except for small pieces of dynamic functionality.

At least in the DC area.<p>I went car-less for about 6 months as an experiment.  Initially, I tried to compute value from the local car sharing services, but it didn't compute.  Plus, the nearby cars seemed to be heavily used, limiting availability.  So, I never signed up with them.  Instead, I discovered that with a little foresight and planning, I could get economy rentals from the big rental companies via priceline for like $12-15 a day.  Of course, I had to pay for the gas, but insurance was covered by my credit card.  It worked out well for times when I had to commute outside the urban area.<p>Inside the urban area of DC, I found that driving was extremely painful with traffic and parking, but oftentimes it was still less hassle than trying to get around the DC metro system.  The DC metro system doesn't work.  The train system has frequent delays, huge time gaps between trains, over-packed cars, limited times of operation, and trips are expensive.  Furthermore, the bus system seems to have bizarre, unoptimized routes.<p>Anyway, I really want car-sharing to work, but it seems like it can only work in some geographical areas, under certain conditions, and with some local support.  But, I'm always looking forward to new ideas in transportation; it's one of the worst parts of living in DC.",1327593857

Most people are car dependent because our government policies have made it so. If people had to pay the actual cost of parking, the upkeep of roads, gas, etc. it would be less palatable to drive a car everywhere.<p>Of course our country is overrun by cars, including our cities. The government has enacted policies that encourage car driving above other transportation means. This in turn has encouraged suburbanization, which, as you point out, generally requires a car-centric lifestyle.<p>There is nothing wrong with suburbanization, but we wouldn't have nearly the extent of suburbs that we have now if all transportation options were on equal footing. And it shouldn't be the governments job to make car travel so cheap that people buy large, cheap houses in the middle of nowhere.<p>This also ignores all the other costs of car-centric living such as increased risks for obesity, heart disease, depression, etc. If you live in a walkable area, you naturally walk a lot more and get daily exercise.

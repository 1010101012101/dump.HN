I'll be searching or writing up an article on communities, karma and how the hunt for karma [0] can have unintended side effects.  The solution(s) are not simple and time consuming.

Stability is not important, you can run on .com domain, or buy domain at the same company as google for $20 and host anywhere in stable country in case, we are talking about on-line business ...'</i> <p>The way I interpreted the question asked was <i>'would you start a startup ""in"" Russia?'</i> [0].  So having some local knowledge would you recommend locating  a startup somewhere in Russia? Taking advantage of the local environment (programming & scientific talent, closeness to the east, differences in RUB/USD, etc.)<p>I take your point. As for the market, yes the numbers (0.5 a US) is pretty compelling. One thing I would recommend is a <i>middle man</i> or someone who is a native or has been native. <p>I remember an instance where a product was to be launched into Japan and the translations done where very straight boring and while good Japanese not exactly the <i>hip</i> type language the local market would expect. Having a cultural understanding will avoid potential disasters.<p><i></i>Reference<i></i><p>[0] But reading it again maybe that's wrong. ",1176294671

I'm curious if there's any way to avoid the phenomenon I have seen a lot lately (at least once a day) where someone creates a topic like this and it gets voted up a lot.  I know karma isn't that important, but for someone to get 50 points just for making a topic like this while someone else has to make about 10 thoughtful comments or 5 good submissions somehow seems unfair.<p>Comments?  Suggestions?  Am I the only one who feels this way?",1176293830

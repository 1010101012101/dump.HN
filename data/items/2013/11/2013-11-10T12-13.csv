The gallery was separated from the trading floor by bullet-proof glass shortly after his visit.<p>The book is chock full of hacking techniques, by which I mean using systems (subways, payphones, shelter, society, politics) in unexpected ways. Contrary to popular belief, the content of the book is mostly <i>legal</i> things one can do to live for free.<p>Reflecting the times, Hoffman&#x27;s politics are very socialist, not libertarian. However, the book would be well appreciated by HN readers. I&#x27;m sure there are free copies easily found on the web.",1384088329

6706269,comment,6705546,6706020,9,0,bad_user,,,"First of all James Roper is one of the main engineers working on the Play Framework. You&#x27;re quick to jump to conclusions.<p>The &quot;Promise pattern&quot; is extremely awful for Java. Yes, Play does allow Java developers to do Async I/O by means of Futures/Promises. That doesn&#x27;t make it any less awful and a quick search on Play&#x27;s mailing list should highlight it. The reason for it is because working with Future/Promise instances involves a lot of calls to map() and flatMap(). In comparison to java.util.concurrent.Future (which sucks), these Futures are non-blocking and can be processed and transformed without doing a .get() ... We aren&#x27;t talking about one or two calls, but rather about chains of calls. Scala is a language designed for this, it even has monad comprehensions and an upcoming library that should bring C#&#x27;s async [1]<p>Iteratees are also one of the coolest notions for dealing with streams of data that ever came out of the FP world. And if in Java you can sort of limp around when it comes to simple Future/Promise objects, well Iteratees are in a different league [2] [3]<p>The Play developers did an extremely awesome job by exposing a clean Java API. But some things are sorely missing, as there&#x27;s no way to expose them in Java cleanly, which is why the internals of Play&#x27;s server are written in Scala.<p>Also, it does make sense to compare frameworks in language comparisons. For example you can&#x27;t compare C# versus Java for web development, without comparing the frameworks themselves. If Play also allows you to use Java, that&#x27;s only testament to the awesomeness of Scala, of the JVM and of Play&#x27;s developers.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/scala/async"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scala/async</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://mandubian.com/2012/08/27/understanding-play2-iteratees-for-normal-humans/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mandubian.com/2012/08/27/understanding-play2-iteratee...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/Iteratees"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/Iteratees</a>",1384088181

6706259,comment,6704846,6705168,1,0,mtdewcmu,,,"Possibly. OO theory and Java (I don&#x27;t really distinguish the two) actively encourage creating lots of classes to do simple things. I think a lot of people would look at that style and nod approvingly at the use of design patterns and correct use of OO idioms. They wouldn&#x27;t see much wrong with it. OO theory also promotes good, commonsense ideas, like limiting the number of classes and the limiting the complexity of the interactions among them. But they contradict themselves, because lots of classes and complex designs are the inevitable consequence of the style they preach.<p>Objects can be considered a bad idea on their face, because they are made up of code wrapped tightly around state variables that are supposed to be secret and hidden. The functional style preaches the exact opposite: functions should not have side effects; all their state is either passed-in or returned. The more state your program keeps, and the greater the number of types of transitions that are possible, the greater the number of ways that the overall state can become inconsistent and cause an error. The way to keep the problem in check is to try to make state and state transitions simple and clear. I&#x27;m not a functional absolutist -- I don&#x27;t use functional languages very often, and I see nothing wrong with doing simple things in the most natural style and language -- but I think the point is valid about how to deal with state.",1384087849

There&#x27;s a problem in patent law, that you&#x27;re infringing even if independently invented it. (Copyright is different, you only infringe if you actually copied - though see &quot;unconscious copying&quot;). Your suggestion could be implemented, I think, just by getting rid of that. Which might be a good thing, though difficult. It&#x27;s a big change (though copyright case law and legislation would provide some guidance.)<p>Of course, inventors need to be able sue people that they didn&#x27;t help produce it, so the copying part is important.<p>Alternatively, make it a requirement that you have to make prototypes and put it into production. This is also a big change (though, in the past, a prototype <i>was</i> a requirement). But I think it would be easily gamed, with shell production companies. From the other side, for real inventors, what if production requires substantial capital investment? The producer just refuses, and the patent fails. Maybe other requirements could avoid this, but seems tricky.",1384086748

The same things goes re: NIH at most large companies.  It&#x27;s not that the homegrown tool is better, but if it&#x27;s the difference between spending $250k on dev and $100k/yr on maintenance and improvements versus $1.5m on licensing, $500k on implementation and change management and another $250k/yr ongoing... those things get a lot of scrutiny.  Especially when they&#x27;re not driving the profit.  As a couple of examples, let&#x27;s look at homegrown HR systems vs things like Workday.  Workday is loads better and they are constantly adding new features, but it is always easy to excuse a homegrown HR system because of innumerable edge cases in localized employment law, or ties to tiny payroll systems in third world countries that you&#x27;ve already built but no one else has, or ....  Netsuite is having the same adoption challenges vs Oracle & SAP, too.  It&#x27;s not that the big guys are objectively better, necessarily, but that they&#x27;ve been around long enough and have a huge enough consulting arm (and external partners) to have seen almost every possible business scenario globally.  There&#x27;s a lot of value there, and it often leads to short sighted and myopic decisions.<p>I don&#x27;t actually know that this is true, but I suspect the vast majority of programmers work for large, non-software-product companies, and most of them spend their time primarily on KTLO work, not any kind of innovation or profit creation.",1384084936

Financial contributions allow the Red Cross to purchase exactly what is needed for the disaster relief operation. Monetary donations also enable the Red Cross to purchase relief supplies close to the disaster site which avoids delays and transportation costs in getting basic necessities to disaster victims. Because the affected area has generally experienced significant economic loss, purchasing relief supplies in or close to the disaster site also helps to stimulate the weakened local economy.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.redcross.org/support/donating-fundraising/other-ways-to-give/donating-goods"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.redcross.org/support/donating-fundraising/other-w...</a>",1384084915

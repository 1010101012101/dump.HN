It frees up one hand majority of the time and she doesn't have to think about it through turns.<p>For me, the benefits of an automatic are trivial compared to the joy of driving a manual transmission, with one great exception: stop-and-go traffic.<p>The process of driving a manual usually boils down to engaging the clutch partially, briefly, so that not too much fuel is wasted for each acceleration. My shins get tired after at least 20 minutes of this. You would think doing this routine every day would make it more tolerable. Surprisingly, it does not.<p>Now that I do not have to freeway commute to work, considering a manual for the next purchase. As already stated, they are more fun to drive.<p>On topic, I'd say this is why I do not prefer Apple's walled garden of simplicity. I don't want these choices made for me, necessarily. I like the fact that I can install any software I wish, at any time. As has been said uncountable times, the iPad is directed at certain types of users. I am not one of those types, and I doubt I would ever be. If I had disposable income (where I could afford to throw away $500 on an entertainment device), I'd buy one. My wife would love it, and I'd use it for idle surfing now and again. I might even make some interesting apps for Safari. Wouldn't want to learn Objective-C though, because what good is writing a program if your own computer won't even allow you to run it?",1270501191

For example, total tax revenues are 28% of GDP, and corporate-tax revenues are 3.3% of GDP; both figures are higher in Ireland, meaning that Irish taxation overall takes a bigger bite out of the Irish economy than U.S. taxation does out of the U.S. one.<p>Data on that last point: <a href=""http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/48/27/41498733.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/48/27/41498733.pdf</a>",1270499662

Although being that authority to fire is in the hands of the ground commander, he should have asked what the heck they were firing on. From the sounds of it, I think he was tied up with other things at the time he gave said permission, which doesn't absolve him from his role.",1270498136

I'm just pointing out that you can't criticize it using outdated conventions.<p>Out of curiosity suppose you're the soldier in that situation and your CO says to engage. Do you refuse to do so? That itself has to violate military protocol right? Do you say ""but they're unarmed, are you sure?"" then follow whatever instructions you're given?<p>From what I've read/heard of Marines, the people in the field are expected to make more of their own decisions than in other branches of the military. There's less micromanagement I suppose would be a good way of summing it up, and as a result this would have been less likely to have happened in the first place in that branch. Is that true?",1270498133

If they adjust the pricing, they need to do it across the board so that some of these garages don't have a license to steal.  Personally I think it discourages commerce and freedom for the merchants and citizens.  Everyone is for it probably already takes the bus or does not have a car.  Everyone should be able to make their own choices without getting ripped off by this greedy city.

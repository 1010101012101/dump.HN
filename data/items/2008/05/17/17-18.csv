See:<p><pre><code>  http://www.prescod.net/rest/ \n</code></pre>\nin particular:<p><pre><code>  http://www.prescod.net/rest/rest_vs_soap_overview/\n</code></pre>\nSOAP is indeed on the way out but not quite for the reasons most people say. It's not just due to the overhead, or even the incompatibilities. These are symptoms of the fact that it's solving the wrong problem. SOAP is a way to tear your program apart and put half of it on one machine and half of it on another. REST is a design strategy that requires the absolute minimum of coordination, thus it scales somewhat better, like the web itself.<p>That said, magical RPC-injection protocols like SOAP often work really well for quick and dirty apps within a single organization.",1211045919

192767,comment,192689,192689,0,0,jlujan,,,"SOAP was engineered by enterprise companies for enterprise applications. It came form the same thought train as COM/DCOM, CORBA, etc.,. It is still a major player in the enterprise world. You wont see many B2B apps that don't use SOAP or some other XML payload. I have used SOAP extensively in PHP and C#, together even. The support is there for it if you look. Java actually has good support for SOAP, if not the best (<a href=""http://java.sun.com/webservices/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://java.sun.com/webservices/</a> <a href=""http://ws.apache.org/axis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ws.apache.org/axis/</a>).<p>Most of the haters on SOAP and other thick WS technologies are people trying to do simple AJAX type message transfers. SOAP is a little heavy for that. But when you try passing messages between multiple systems in multiple languages, it becomes the obvious solution. As far as the following response goes...\n ""allow me to put it this way: 1k of text to get a 2 or 3 digit temperature from a weather service.""\nSOAP stacks will automatically parse that 2-3 digit number into the correct data type for the platform/language you are using. Now say instead of a 2-3 digit number you passed an entire object or data structure. Would it be easier to role your own parser or have the SOAP stack automatically marshal it for you?<p>Added to this, when you use the full set of SOAP technologies including WSDL and XSD, you also have data validation and to some extent, documentation. This is what JSON and the likes lack. If you provide a WSDL I can look at it and usually use a tool to automatically generate all the data types and interfaces needed (ie. wsdl in .Net). You point me at a JSON interface and I have no such luxury. I wont know what data to expect until you write documentation for it. Further neither of us would know if each others messages were valid without some kind of custom validator.<p>Also SOAP is transport layer agnostic. If you use HTTP you can take advantage of any compression the underlying platform supports. Apache's Axis and Perl's SOAP::Lite both support HTTP compression in their SOAP stacks. I am aware of ways to enable it in .Net as well.<p>Advances in computing power and network resources are making SOAP a more viable option, not less. It comes down to using the right tool for the job and REST is viable in some applications, but SOAP is as well. SOAP's life span will be at least as long as COM or CORBA. They haven't completely died yet either...",1211045093

Blogs will put less stress on you (or whoever ends up with the duty of writing it) than a vlog will.<p>Blogs can be written from anywhere, on any computer, and in bits and pieces. You could write an update in an airport terminal, at your home, at your work, or in the park.<p>A vlog will require a quite location, a solid chunk of time, and in most cases a pre-written script, which could have probably just gone to your blog in the first place.<p>I suppose vlogs could put a more personal face on the startup, which may or may not help you connect with your customers. If you think it would help, you could create vlogs much more infrequently than the blogs, maybe just for large milestones in the company.<p>Interesting side note: Even though they broadcasted live 24/7 for a while, Justin.tv also had a blog. I'm not sure exactly why, but I'll bet that elad's point about blogs being indexed had something to do with it.",1211044985

There was a decent one-time set-up charge, to cut the screens-- but once this was done, the per-shirt charge was pretty reasonable (pricing depended on the quality of the shirt and the number of colors), and the screens were kept on file in case there were repeat orders.<p>Any vendor should be able to send you samples, so you can check out the quality of the printing.<p>I'd suggest you try to find someone reasonably local, so you can pick up the shirts yourself and avoid the shipping costs, and can check out the quality in person.

Procrastinating obviously robs time from ""useful"" activities like working, but how much use are these activities, really? Work applied correctly certainly brings humanity as a whole to new and better pastures, but I'm wondering whether this is really the case for me as an individual.<p>Personally, I find it very pleasant to waste time. If I don't have anything in particular to do (when I'm on vacation, for instance), I get bored with whatever time-sinks I have in about two weeks and quickly move on to something that brings me forward as a person. But if there are demanding activities occupying my mind - when I study, or learn a new skill, or have a job - wasting time seems to become a natural and healthy part of my life. Four hours a day seems like a good ballpark figure - according to this I spend 28 hours every week doing nothing, in addition to whatever useful things I do the rest of the time. I fail to see how this is a problem.<p>To me it seems as if recreation naturally follows from any demanding activity. If you get 8 hours of real work done every day, what is the problem if another four are spent doing nothing? Or even if you only get four hours of real work done every day, or two, you will still produce more wealth than an average Joe would be able to produce 80 years ago. I guess what I'm questioning is the aspiration of being great if you don't find it natural.<p>Doesn't this apply even, as PG writes in ""How to do what you love"", if your work is the most interesting and rewarding part of your life?

229595,comment,228683,229287,0,0,djm,,,"I read Brave New World when I was in college. I didn't find it a particularly good read to be honest but I liked the very direct way Huxley categorizes humans in his alpha to epsilon system and how everyone knew where they stood.<p>In the real world everyone rates themselves in comparison to other people too, but most of the time the process is not very open. In the workplace people are prevented from saying what they think about other people by office politics, employment law, and HR policies against this and that. Probably the only place it is really transparent is in school (If memory servers correct there is a PG essay about this).<p>Stranger in a strange land is definitely a great book and Heinlein has to be one of the greats of SF writing. Read 'the moon is a harsh mistress' too if you get the chance.",1214555578
229594,comment,229047,229047,0,0,zby,,,"It's packed with NLP tricks to capture your attention and sooooooo long.  What is really interesting in this article is this:<p>The account of perception that’s starting to emerge is what we might call the “brain’s best guess” theory of perception: perception is the brain’s best guess about what is happening in the outside world. The mind integrates scattered, weak, rudimentary signals from a variety of sensory channels, information from past experiences, and hard-wired processes, and produces a sensory experience full of brain-provided color, sound, texture, and meaning. We see a friendly yellow Labrador bounding behind a picket fence not because that is the transmission we receive but because this is the perception our weaver-brain assembles as its best hypothesis of what is out there from the slivers of information we get. Perception is inference.<p>The theory—and a theory is all it is right now—has begun to make sense of some bewildering phenomena. Among them is an experiment that Ramachandran performed with volunteers who had phantom pain in an amputated arm. They put their surviving arm through a hole in the side of a box with a mirror inside, so that, peering through the open top, they would see their arm and its mirror image, as if they had two arms. Ramachandran then asked them to move both their intact arm and, in their mind, their phantom arm—to pretend that they were conducting an orchestra, say. The patients had the sense that they had two arms again. Even though they knew it was an illusion, it provided immediate relief. People who for years had been unable to unclench their phantom fist suddenly felt their hand open; phantom arms in painfully contorted positions could relax. With daily use of the mirror box over weeks, patients sensed their phantom limbs actually shrink into their stumps and, in several instances, completely vanish. Researchers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center recently published the results of a randomized trial of mirror therapy for soldiers with phantom-limb pain, showing dramatic success.<p>A lot about this phenomenon remains murky, but here’s what the new theory suggests is going on: when your arm is amputated, nerve transmissions are shut off, and the brain’s best guess often seems to be that the arm is still there, but paralyzed, or clenched, or beginning to cramp up. Things can stay like this for years. The mirror box, however, provides the brain with new visual input—however illusory—suggesting motion in the absent arm. The brain has to incorporate the new information into its sensory map of what’s happening. Therefore, it guesses again, and the pain goes away.",1214555553

I find white on black easier on the eyes. <i>while admiring his dark desktop theme</i> I agree with the enlarging the type comment, however.<p>As for your post, I will point out that there are save one or two brilliant individuals at the F500 companies here in my midsized city (comparable to the guys (and girls) that frequent here). I've been trying to bring my skillset up to a comfortable level to work with these guys (or someone else at their level) for a while now. It's been slow and steady, and sometimes, I even have my doubts if I can (the maths are not a strong suit of mine).<p>Anyways, I do think there are some great challenges at Fortune 500 companies having worked at a few myself. Do they carry monetary rewards at the level of work that these individuals work at? I don't think so but the rewards seem to come from hands on experience received in using high-end datacenter hardware and working on large scale projects.",1214554470

Human eyes can track objects extremely well.<p>Here's a simple test to do with the demo. Try tracking that motion-blurred cube on the left with your eyes - it's all blurry. Now, try tracking the one on the right - it will be  sharp, but ""jumpy"". Now, try tracking the one on the right with your 120Hz monitor - the motion should be MUCH smoother - and that's where the need for high frame rates comes in. The higher the frame rate, the better the object will look when you're tracking it with your eyes.<p>Ideally, if we only account for objects travelling across the screen in 2 seconds, and a screen is ~2000 pixels wide, and we want to have an error of <=1 pixel, then theoretically, we need (2000px)/(2sec) = 1000 Hz frame rate for high motion realism.

5211458,comment,5209618,5209618,6,0,saosebastiao,,,"I'm gonna participate in the time-honored HN tradition of being a Debbie Downer.<p>Dashboards suck. Not because they are inherently bad, but because of the return on investment. There are two types:<p>1) The dashboards that are created using blood sweat and tears...paying attention to every possible detail, trying to maximize information conveyed per square millimeter. These dashboards are works of art and are incredibly interesting when done right, but involve thousands of hours of trained developer time to get to this point. They exist for the explicit purpose of facilitating decision making procedures. And yet, in all my experience building them, the time spent maximizing information conveyed per square millimeter is a complete and utter waste, because the decisions that are facilitated by the information can, for the most part, be trivially automated and optimized using the same data sets and the same analysis that was used to create the graphic.<p>2) Dashboards that, due to some software package that eases their design, are incredibly easy to create...and completely uninformative. The developers of these packages think their software is great because it makes the creation of pretty graphs easy, but they leave the job of making the graphs informative up to the user. But making a graph informative is the hardest part! The myriad tweaks that are necessary to increase information density either do not exist, or they are incomplete hacks that are only possible due to a bug that might be fixed soon.<p>I believe that the only reason they exist is to satisfy the egos of executives and micromanagers. They believe that if they have all the data at their fingertips, they can command and execute with perfection. These are the people who think you are there for one reason only: ""Give me the data and I will tell you what to do"". What they fail to realize is that by the time the data has been extracted, transformed, and visualized, the developer understands the data and its implications way better than anyone who only sees the high level summaries.<p>FnordMetric has its market, and it looks like it will do very well in this niche. But it won't make your business any better. If you want software that makes your business better, look for optimization software (think Optimizely, Lokad, or my personal favorite, Gurobi)...and then empower your devs to programatically make the data-driven decisions for you.",1360730998

There is a determined push by most courts across the country to not try cases that could be settled. Some force day-of-trial mediation for simple suits. For complex suits, the vast majority now require at least some mediation.<p>If you come along, refuse to settle a case that is by-the-books law <i>and you lose</i>, judges will generally impose enough to make you think twice about doing this again.<p>Whether they should, whether it's right, this is what happens.
This has actually been fairly successful on the torts side.  Only something like 2% of tort cases now go to trial across the US.   Results in other areas are not so good yet.  Family law is an area where it is very hard to get people to settle, even when lawyers on both sides tell their clients ""you won't get what you want at trial, the judge is going to follow the law and statutory guidelines, and do X. We should settle"". They still want a trial (mostly because they want some judge to tell them they were right and their ex was wrong, and instead the judge just tells them both they are wasting his time), then get angry at the lawyers.<p>In any case, to be fair to the judges, most people truly have no concept of the amount of stupid cases[1] that the average federal district court judge sees.  This kind of stuff is why the average civil lawsuit now takes years to resolve.<p>[1]  Not person did dumb thing stupid, but cases that are so trivially resolvable that they complete waste of time for everyone involved.",1360730764

He claims that being a white heterosexual male makes everything in life easier in the same way that choosing the easy difficulty setting makes a video game easier. It doesn't necessarily mean that your life is easier than everybody's life on more difficult settings but if two people are in the same situation, the heterosexual white male will have it easier. is this correct?<p>I just find this a huge simplification and generalisation. Sure, it may ring true with some people but it is an opinion piece. It doesn't present any evidence for its claims. Not everyone that reads it will draw the same conclusions about it as you. So it does nothing to change the validity of my hyperbolic list which I never presented as fact but as an illustration of the frustration that many men are feeling.<p>As stated above, the list is not a list of facts but it describes how the frustration that many men are experiencing so it is pointless to attempt to repudiate each point. Some of these points are huge issues however, and do seem to be indicative of systemic sexism towards men. Maybe you don't feel the same way but many people do.<p>Your ""Always appropriate"" comment hit a nerve because it basically says that any issues that men have with sexism towards them is null and void(regardless if it is in the form of an exaggerated list of issues) because this guy(Scalzi) says men have things easier and it doesn't matter in what context the issues arise because it is ""always appropriate"". Now maybe you didn't mean it that way but I cannot see how it can be taken any other way.<p>I do believe that the baseline (as you call it) needs to be discussed but believe it or not, not everyone sees it the same way as you or Scalzi. It is certainly not as simple as Scalzi makes it seem. Sexism towards men IS part of the ""baseline"".<p>I also take issue that you now feel that the list represents my beliefs. I never presented them as such. I have not made up my mind about them but I do feel that there are issues here. I am by no means a mens rights nut but I do feel that male issues are underrepresented and your ""Always appropriate"" comment is analogous to a ""Don't worry your pretty little head about it"" response to a woman bringing up sexism towards women. The fact that you don't see that is frustrating.<p>Having said that, I am not going to change your mind and you are not going to change mine so this is pointless.",1360730640

I grew up reading Uncle Scrooge comics (and even at age 8, I could tell a Carl Barks story just from a glance, even if I didn't know who Carl Barks was at the time) but the first episode of Duck Tales I saw just infuriated me.  They <i>ruined</i> Carl's stories.<p>For instance, the one episode they link to in the article, ""Back to the Klondike"" is <i>nothing</i> like the comic story.  In the comic, Glittering Goldie stole Scrooge's gold nugget by drugging him---he goes back to town, forces Goldie to give him his gold back, plus sign an I.O.U. for the rest, with interest.  The story is him going back to collect on the I.O.U. with a now penniless Goldie and him intentionally throwing a contest (via a subplot of him losing his memory) to let Goldie ""win"".<p>The show?  Too much changed and I couldn't even watch it past the 10 minute mark when they introduced two new characters never in the original story.  Goldie was presented as a love interest (there is no love story in the original comic) and the subplot leading to Scrooge throwing the contest was dropped entirely.  Given that I stopped watching a very painful episode for me, I don't know what else Disney did to the story, but I just can't stand the show.<p>Okay, I can somewhat understand Disney's reluctance in using Donald, but really?  Launchpad McQuack?  And you really needed April's nieces in the stories?  Ahhhhh!<p>I also can appreciate and admire the animation quality for a TV show.

5211421,comment,5210596,5211177,46,0,derefr,,,"> I would speculate that LSD turns on System 2 where normally my System 1 brain would give me an immediate response.<p>As far as I've read, LSD is, surprisingly, just a serotonin agonist, similar to anti-depressants or MDMA. (Technically, it's a <i>non-selective</i> serotonin agonist, and it does this by <i>reversing</i> the chemical reactions that take serotonin apart, to basically ""un-use-up"" serotonin you've already spent--which might explain its differing experiential effects--but in the end it still means ""more serotonin in the brain."")<p>Now, the two things serotonin has been heavily implicated for in neurology, are <i>pleasure</i> (though not <i>reward</i>; that's dopamine), and <i>neurogenesis</i>: serotonin is basically released when something ""feels good"" in a sensual way--something looks aesthetically pleasing, something tastes delicious, etc.--as a signal to the <i>rest</i> of your brain to backtrack to what <i>caused</i> this stimulus to happen, and build up the neurons involved. Basically, if I find some tasty berries while foraging, reinforce the memory of the walk I took to get to the berries. [This effect can be harnessed: consume a bit of some fat-saturated food right after you study something, if you want to remember it better.]<p>But LSD, MDMA, and other drugs that stimulate serotonin release, can have psychedelic effects well beyond what you'd expect from ""remembering things better."" This is because the reaction to serotonin, <i>neurogenesis</i>, goes way beyond sensible memory formation. It takes <i>any</i> spikes in electrochemical activity that are going on in the brain at the time, and says ""that: build up the synapse for that."" And, of course, neurons have an underlying level of <i>noise</i>, that usually gets buried under actual cognition--so, when you turn the ""gain"" up on what ""becomes brain cells"", suddenly you start forming 'concepts' for ideas that are made of <i>nothing at all</i>--the feeling of seeing shared properties between things that have none. Which would indeed, likely, be best described as ""a trip.""<p>Of course, this also informs the other thing people--especially those in creative fields--say about LSD: that it's a life-altering experience, quite foundational for later productive work. This is basically because pushing up the ""noise floor,"" if you have a lot of potential ideas lurking just below the surface as potential connections you haven't made between concepts, ready to be exploited--they'll get wired together by the non-selective flood of serotonin too. But, unlike the nodes for ""the purpleness of music"" or what-have-you, these nodes will actually self-reinforce once created--that is, they're <i>useful</i> to have, so you'll keep using them--so they'll stick around, whereas the other synapses will just get their reactivity scaled back down when it turns out how purple a song is doesn't have any causal impact on anything else. :)",1360730374

Instead you get the typical empty-head drug talk about ""seeing god"" and ""being nothing."" And for all the elaborate salesmanship, what do these people get in the end? They're extremely ineloquent and whatever wisdom is purported to be there, just doesn't seem to be there.<p>Psychedelics give an empirical experience that is undeniable  but most people don't have the cognitive constructs to interpret that experience in a logically consistent way.  Take for example the idea of frequencies.  To me a shift in perspective is like tuning into a different frequency.  It's a metaphor that conveys the many alleged isomorphisms between these two phenomena.   But to someone who doesn't have this logical background or frame of mind will take a syncretic interpretation like beings literally giving off vibrations and perspective literally having the attribute of frequency.  As Sam Harris says, taking psychedelics is like getting into a sling shot, you don't really know where it's going to lead for any given person.  They will give you ""trans-rational"" experiences but you still end up interpreting that experience through whatever cognitive constructs you already hold.  If you're a fundamentalist christian then you're going to interpret the experience through those constructs.  If you're an atheist you're going to interpret it through those constructs.<p>The most striking aspect of the psychedelic experience to me is the isomorphisms that present themselves.  I start seeing one-to-one mappings between different phenomena(real or not).  This hyperawareness of morphisms extends into the visions where every aspect of the vision correspond to some meaning.  It's an amazing experience that isn't so easily dismissed.",1360730348

Living in a city very near the border (3 hours away), work in a offshore software developing agency, friends and my father works and used to work at Ford's maquiladora and other industries.<p>For a very long time, foreign investment have played a large role in our economy, since early in the 1900, there is a lot of investment in minery particularly on the states near the border. With the modern age, a lot of ""maquiladoras"" exists in the cities that are near the border, Tijuana, Juarez, Monterrey, Hermosillo,  Nogales. The labor hand is incredibly cheap, and it's not only because the companies like Ford or Motorola or Samsung wants to pay low wages, the government plays a large role since not very long ago our economy secretary considered that a person who makes ~$500 a month can afford to have a car, a good house and send their kids to private schools (which is of course a stupid lie). A typical laborer works 48 hours a week and is expected to change schedules as the needs changes, often working more than these 48 hours sometimes pulling up to 60 hours a week or even more. The average salary for a laborer in a month is around $600, which is around $3 an hour. It is enough to live a fair life. To put this in perspective, the minimun wage is around $4 a DAY.
The article says the average wage is $6 an hour, but I find that inaccurate from what I can see every day.<p>A laborer typically hasn't finished their school, probably dropped before going to college or are graduates who studied something with not a lot of demand, like administration (probably the most studied grade) or graduates that fail to find a job for what they studied. In the eyes of the big companies, the laborers are just disposable people, there's always more from where they came from. People settle with the first opportunity they see, a lot of people dream is to find a job in the government and retire 40 years later. There is a lot of apathy and I think that's one of the reasons we don't progress as a country (Our president is a disgrace, for example).<p>Luckily the software industry is MUCH different. It's one of the best paid professions here, very flexible hours and working Monday to Friday and the pay is 4 times greater than that of an industry laborer and even then that's less than a junior level engineer would earn, all you need to know is how to speak English and learn some web development. A well paid software engineer with around 5 years of experience, earns around $14 an hour, which is I think around twice the minimum wage in USA? An entry level engineer earns around $5.<p>Life here is much cheaper, I can go out with my girlfriend, eat something fancy, buy a 3 liters of beer and go see a movie with $25 and still have some money left.",1360730190

What this paper says is that increasing parking does not help the city, economically speaking.<p>If the thesis is correct - which the data seems to support - then having cars diminishes the options for those who want a ""vibrant city."" If you're in favor of options, then surely you should be in favor of no-car parts of town, no?<p>If you're in favor of more options, then (as the author comments on a link from his home page), do you think that ""factors like suburban infrastructure and the distance to most business centers and even the distance between many stores have made people reliant on motor vehicles"" and reduced the transportation options?<p>You write that you don't want to remove options.

But aside from that, there's a lot to sneer at in this article.<p>First, on government and the internet.  It's true that <i>""most Internet activity takes place in particular territories governed by states ... [as are] users, ... servers, ...""</i>, but so what?  States are not only trying to govern what is done within their borders, they are trying to govern what is done outside their borders.  If I start a server in China, and serve pirated software to users in the UK, a country I have never visited, the UK government will still try to prosecute me.  But all the things within the UK are things that do not belong to me and that I do not control!  I'm not taking a position here on whether they should or should not.... I'm pointing out that Micheal Lind is encouraging an even dumber mental model than ""cyberspace"".<p>And it makes _perfect_ sense to say that California or the US is <i>""extending their jurisdiction into cyberspace""</i>.  It is _not_ the case that they have jurisdiction over everything within their borders.  For an extreme and unambiguous example, the US refuses to take -- and forbids California from taking -- jurisdiction over my religious belief.  More relevantly, as I understand it, in 1900 the US took no jurisdiction over the movement of gold, and then later they extended their jurisdiction.  States (both the kind that the US is, and the kind that California is) do extend their jurisdiction from time to time (and very rarely contract it).  Again, Lind is talking nonsense.<p>As others have pointed out, people complain all the time about corporations invading abstract things.  Public spaces, the classroom/academy/etc, your living room, the national news agenda... those are all ""spaces"" that people have complained about corporations invading, and they're not all literal spaces (and of the ones that are, at most one involves a literal physical presence).  Metaphorical invasions, including of non-spatial things.  Welcome to the English language, Michael Lind, are you new here?  Or just disingenuous and demagogic?<p>All in all, the bulk of this article is worse than the thing it denounces.<p>That said, props for the mention of A Declaration of the Interdependence of Cyberspace, which I hadn't heard of or read, and which I think is a pretty great rant (even if I think casting aside Article 27.2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights just might be a good idea).<p><a href=""http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/print/9236603/A_Declaration_of_the_Interdependence_of_Cyberspace"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/print/9236603/A_Decla...</a>",1360728727

Lack of these means infrastructure will be tough to setup and you are making it harder on imported human resources.<p>2. Culture, infrastructure and security. These go hand-in-hand. If you don't understand and play by the rules of the culture, security is compromised, and without security, infrastructure is at risk. Without infrastructure things are much more costly. A less liberal government (one that enforces conviction of drug lords that make security a nightmare) may result in better security and therefore better infrastructure.<p>3. Resources. Access to labor, materials, etc.<p>4. Heat. In hotter climates, humans are rewarded physically by not working as hard by the fact that they don't get overheated. This is engrained in almost all of us, but even more so when evolution and natural selection also have rewarded lazy behavior. I will probably get downvoted multiple times for saying this, and it isn't true everywhere, but I believe that it happens and can become a cultural phenomenon. Ever heard of a siesta? I know it is just a ""break"", right...",1360728412

It's not intended to be a disincentive, rather a plaintiff is only supposed to be able to recover actual damages.  The guiding principle is ""make whole"" -- a plaintiff can go to court to recover actual losses, and no more.  Punitive damages are assessed where the defendant is shown to have willfully and intentionally harmed the plaintiff, but only in extreme circumstances should those damages exceed the actual damages incurred from the act itself.<p>The statutory minimums don't really adhere to that principle which is unfortunate.",1360728204

Instead, I calculate what your eyes would realistically see.

If you track the moving square, then by definition there should be zero motion blur (if your display were perfect).

It&#x27;s like the Trojan Horse, it looks okay on the outside. The particles being dealt with for a billion years I imagine have varied little in their molecular construction and bio-reactivity.<p>Your idea is that we can introduce tons of new plastic particles into the environment having all the disruptive properties plastics have been shown to have, but it&#x27;s okay because there are already &#x27;particles&#x27; in the environment.<p>Elsewhere you question what studies have been conducted to quantify damage done by these particles.<p>As you may know, the earth is an immensely complex system. Sometimes it is relatively easy to draw a causal line from A to B. Other times the effects of something are no doubt there, but the interworkings of so many factors make it hard to precisely quantify the effects of any one factor.(see Honeybees and Colony Collapse Disorder[1])<p>So your idea that we should go ahead and saturate the environment with this substance that has been shown in other realms and at other scales to be detrimental, and then if someone happens to take an interest in precisely quantifying damage that it is doing, <i>then</i> we can do something about it, seems wrongheaded.<p>Maybe you&#x27;re just playing the reflexive contrarian like <i>worklogin</i>, &quot;shouldn&#x27;t we avoid laws?&quot; This is precisely what laws are for, to protect the common good! And it isn&#x27;t a stretch to infer damage being done based on what we know about plastic.<p>[1]<a href=""http://cdn.billmoyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/67296281_bee_stress_624in-1.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn.billmoyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/6729628...</a>",1403038752

7906958,comment,7898035,7899134,1,0,naivegenius,,,"I did a quick search and nobody mentioned pickup, but I seriously recommend it.<p>I had the same problem with introversion. And people are often surprised because I seem very outgoing. I followed a very clear path to get to where I am and it&#x27;s outlined below. There are some very simple things you can do right now to make progress. I felt like I had to change my entire wardrobe, personality, and gain muscle. None of this was necessary and just lowered my self esteem.<p>First, find a pickup group. Just google around or contact me. Then go out with that group and try the following things in order. Do each one several times. If one of them is too easy then just skip it. I had to start at the very bottom. It was that bad for me, but pickup helped me be social and outgoing naturally, so it&#x27;s not just about women.<p>1. Go to a supermarket or a mall and just ask questions from a female cashier. Say you&#x27;re getting a gift for a female friend. Say you don&#x27;t like her, but she likes you. This is super fun.\n2. Go up to 10 random people in a supermarket or wherever and give them a compliment on something. I felt really good after doing this. It taught me that communication that isn&#x27;t technically productive can bring people a lot of joy.\n3. Get used to approaching women -- any women at all. Go into a mall or any place with lots of people and approach the first 3 women you see. They don&#x27;t have to be pretty; you don&#x27;t have to like them. They can be old or young. It&#x27;s important that you do not discriminate. It helps build a reflex to approach women, and prevents you from having to decide who to approach and who to avoid. This one thing has helped me more than I can tell you.\n4. Once you&#x27;re somewhat comfortable approaching women, then just see how long you can stay in the conversation.\n5. Then near the middle of each conversation ask for the woman&#x27;s phone number.\n6. Then get used to asking women to go on a date with you, even if you&#x27;re not interested.<p>All of the above is practice and necessary. Then when you meet a girl you really like while going out then you will know what to do. I glossed over a lot of details, but I&#x27;m sure you can do this.<p>Your pickup group can become your first group of friends. It&#x27;s a little weird at first, but many of them are still my friends. You can tell them things that are too intimate to discuss with even a girlfriend. My group helped me a lot. And you need that positivity because hitting on girls is hard. You&#x27;ll get rejected a lot. But that negative feedback will tell you exactly what you need to improve.<p>Women&#x27;s minds are hardwired to be attracted to men who are socially intelligent. By practicing pickup you will naturally become socially intelligent. This social intelligence has helped me get more friends, land more interviews, negotiate, and even helped me get into events for free.<p>Pickup is not for the faint of heart, but I&#x27;d still be lost without it. I say it&#x27;s worth a shot.<p>Contact me\nnaivegenius@gmail.com<p>I will do my best to help you.",1403038687

I get tons of referrals now from past candidates, but I almost never ask for referrals. I&#x27;d rather be the one not asking for them, which differentiates me from most other firms out there.<p>If they didn&#x27;t ask you to forward, would you freely respond with what you in fact are looking for, or would the recruiter specifically have to ask that? I usually phrase my intros by saying if the opportunity I presented isn&#x27;t something you are interested in, I&#x27;d like to learn about what types of things would interest you so I can let you know about only those opportunities if they happen to come across my desk.

7906948,comment,7903938,7905876,4,0,enraged_camel,,,"I&#x27;m not convinced that lack of religion and pessimism are correlated at all. In my experience, religious people are as likely to be pessimistic as non-religious people. The latter may be more cynical, but those people were almost always religious at some point in their lives and their darker attitudes are caused by their disillusionment about religion, rather than by lack of religion.<p>I think you have some deeply rooted misunderstandings about the relationship between religion and fertility. Religious people have more kids primarily because most organized religions frown upon birth control. It has nothing to do with hope or optimism and everything to do with the fact that they are having sex just as often as non-religious folks but are much more likely to conceive. Another reason is that non-religious people tend to be more independent in their thinking and they question and resist social pressures -- and even economic incentives -- to have kids. Atheist couples are much more open to sitting down and having a conversation about whether they want kids and, if they do, whether they are ready.<p>As for religion and evolution... I don&#x27;t even know where to begin. Just because you&#x27;re popping out child after child doesn&#x27;t mean those children are likely to survive, prosper and reproduce. That is traditionally why people have felt the need to have lots of kids: you didn&#x27;t know how many of them would live long enough to have kids of their own. It is only very recently that modern medicine has significantly decreased child mortality and increased lifespans. This is yet another reason why developed countries have lower birth rates.<p>The bottom line is that your entire narrative seems to be that lack of religion leads to pessimism, which then leads to lower fertility, and this is somehow going to have evolutionary implications. To anyone who is knowledgeable about any of these topics, this is just sheer, unadulterated nonsense.",1403038581

It&#x27;s possible that companies that are in poor markets and likely to do poorly in the next few years <i>have to pay more</i> to attract qualified CEO candidates, because good executives realize the shit the company is in and don&#x27;t want to take the risk of a failure on their resume without being compensated significantly for it.<p>This would also explain why the negative correlation is strongest at the extreme high ends of the pay scale - these are the companies that are in the worst shape - and why these CEOs relied heavily on acquisitions, because they had no talent or useful products in the organization itself.  It also fits with Warren Buffett&#x27;s observation that &quot;When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact.&quot;<p>One way to confirm or deny this hypothesis would be to look at companies that previously were high-performing, and then see what the correlation between CEO pay and the change in market performance is within that group.",1403037599

It puts a ceiling on the tyranny the &quot;powerful&quot; can impose, by allowing empowerment of the less powerful.<p>For the most recent recognition of this concept, note that one of the many, <i>many</i> rules ISIS is imposing is that nobody else can own guns: <a href=""http://claytonecramer.blogspot.com/2014/06/totalitarian-governments-guns.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://claytonecramer.blogspot.com/2014/06/totalitarian-gove...</a> (link to a blog so you won&#x27;t use up your Torgygraph monthly quota; the author is very reliable).

As long as the system allows negative votes to oust the powerful, they too are working under a ceiling, although of course they frequently don&#x27;t realize it until it&#x27;s too late,  e.g. ask Eric Cantor, the first House Majority leader to lose an election since the office was created in 1899.

We have all the expected disadvantages (mostly: no easy shouldComponentUpdate), but things are easy to reason about, otherwise. We found that stuff like &quot;has the user expanded a dropdown&quot; or &quot;which auto-completeable search term has just been entered&quot; works perfectly in a local component&#x27;s setState. The idea is, basically, anything that the user doesn&#x27;t care losing when navigating away from the current screen can go in a local component&#x27;s state. This seems to go entirely against the functional immutability idea, but it significantly reduces the amount of updates we need to do to our big central data structure.<p>I&#x27;m going to build a new thing and I&#x27;m considering going the nice functional way.

But on the flip side, not all welfare is good either.<p>One of the big problems is that it&#x27;s incredibly difficult to know what the good/bad ratio is because the agencies who distribute the money have the wrong incentives.  Because it&#x27;s very difficult to really know (or measure) if someone NEEDS assistance versus WANTS assistance they instead ensure adherence to things which ARE measurable.  Like correctly filling out forms.  Which, all other things being equal, will tend to favor the repeat applicants, those who have friends/relatives who have already applied and successfully received assistance, and things of that nature.<p>Furthermore if you&#x27;re trying to make a career in public service you want to always have a bigger budget and more staff so there&#x27;s no incentive for management to try and prevent abuse; so long as the abuser does a good enough job on the paperwork management or staff can always plead ignorance if they are ever questioned.<p>The incentive for an abuser to abuse is that it&#x27;s easier to not work and collect money than to work and perhaps collect less money, or the same amount of money, or perhaps only slightly more money.  If you believe or figure out that your labor will never be worth more than $9/hr and that caps your income at $1440 a month before taxes and substantially less after.  Even if you have less income from welfare, food stamps, housing, etc it might make sense to do because of the increased free time you would have and thus the better lifestyle.  It also gives you opportunities to work under the table and make far more than you could if you had a regular hourly job if you&#x27;ve got some ambition.<p>Okay so we&#x27;ve established that there&#x27;s motive for people to abuse and motive for those responsible for preventing it to look the other way.  Why is it so hard to imagine that it does in fact happen and that it might not be a trivially small percentage?  I honestly don&#x27;t know what it is, might be 10% or it might be 50% but I&#x27;d need to see some large scale, serious investigation of a scientific nature with outside observers (not self-reporting) to be convinced it&#x27;s only 2%.",1403035466

Blog post coming soon.<p>Interestingly, as your app state gets bigger, you are actually forced to use something like cursors for all state updates, for performance reasons. Naive immutability in javascript means clone-before-modify, which is far too slow when your state values are large. It quickly bubbled up in our profiler. Funneling all immutable updates through a cursor means the cursor can use structure sharing on the state value, skipping the defensive clone and preserving reference equality for equal subtrees. Also afaik, implementing a general shouldComponentUpdate (edit: in js) without something like cursors is not possible, because you need === equality for onChange props.",1403035432

Until we understand quantum gravity it seems premature to write off those possibilities.<p>Even simpler, there is the question of whether the universe allows for arbitrary precision measurement of a physical quantity. If it does, then it may turn out that an observable physical quantity (e.g. the mass or charge of a fundamental particle) is a noncomputable real number. If it doesn't, then it may be possible to represent a neural network with noncomputable real weights, but impossible to actually measure them to enough accuracy to simulate the network on a given input.",1362955784

Yes, the scraper works, but the scraper's code is much messier, and JSON keys, for example, provide some documentation in their own right. Looking at the scraper months later, there's a lot more headscratching. Scraping will work, but it also will leave you searching for many little pieces of information that would be exposed by an API but aren't by a static site.<p>Still, I will agree that scraping is much easier; I've used jsdom (Node.js) extensively, and, for my use cases, it feels like working in a browser (full DOM, scripts, etc.).",1362955743

5353880,comment,5353347,5353440,12,0,bjourne,,,"Here are my highly opinionated opinions about their respective use cases:<p>* BeautifulSoup: It was the best scraping library ever until python-lxml came around and stole the show. Despite that the manual said <i>BeautifulSoup gives you unicode, damnit!</i> it had some long-standing bugs which it gave you strings or incorrectly decoded web pages. I wouldn't use it anymore because lxml is strictly superior.<p>* lxml: The king of scraping libraries. It is a big library so it can be hard to approach. It's actually a collection of markup parsers; lxml.html, lxml.etree and some more I've forgotten about. I almost exclusively use lxml.html since it ""works"" and can handle invalid markup without complaining. Use it like this: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/mattoufoutu/823821"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/mattoufoutu/823821</a> lxml can parse both using jQuery-style selectors with cssselect() and XPath 1.0 with the xpath() method. XPath is hard to learn, but once you get it you have a really powerful parsing tool which makes your life simpler.<p>* pyQuery: Easy to get started with and use. But not as powerful as lxml+XPath.<p>* urllib: Many of the modules in Python's standard library are there because they have been there for a long time. :) python-requests or httplib2 are the best libraries for http.<p>* scrapy: A framework for scheduling and supervising scraper spiders. It takes care of everything from downloading pages, following urls, concurrent requests, handling network errors to storing data in a database or generating csv files. It doesn't parse html itself, but delegates that task to lxml. Personally, I've found scrapy to be very good when your problem <i>fits</i> with how scrapy thinks scraping should be done. If you try to depart from the scrapy-way then scrapy suddenly feels very ""frameworkish"" and limiting. For example, i spent a lot of time trying to get it to support delta-scraping -- periodically scraping the same site, but only download new or changed data -- but it felt impossible getting scrapy to work the way I wanted.<p>* mechanize: Python port of the Perl module WWW::Mechanize. It's good for tasks like scripting logins. If you want to automate login to a site with a username and password, without having to care about session cookies, then mechanize is the ideal choice. Look elsewhere for an html parsing library.<p>* Scrapemark: It has a fun and clever approach to scraping. But once again, not as powerful as lxml.",1362955618

Deep Blue wasn't a model of a human player, but it didn't matter because for the purposes of its construction it performed just as well as one.<p>My money says the singularity happens the exact same way -- we are able to ""fake"" more and more things that look exactly like intelligence until one day we're able to fake intelligence to a degree that it's virtually indistinguishable from our own. We're eventually able to do something that looks like moving our sentience into a computer even though it ""won't really"" be doing it.<p>My guess is that we're hundreds of years away from that date, but whether it happens or not, the fact that an expert right now in the complexity of the underlying physical system has an opinion on the computational problem that probably won't be solved until after 2100 doesn't seem to me to be very relevant. Of course it's complicated. Of course we don't understand it. And of course we can't duplicate the structure of things we don't understand. I believe for any layman in the field all of that goes without saying?",1362954337

5353799,comment,5352462,5352462,1,0,graycat,,,"The article points to some problems, and there are\nsome.  But the article also has some problems.<p>Here is an easier explanation:<p>First, the entrepreneurs are not bringing the\nventure partners enough projects with good,\npowerful, valuable innovation.<p>Second, the venture partners do not want to evaluate\ninnovation and, instead, want to evaluate\n'traction'.  They want to see traction significant\nand growing rapidly.  This concentration on traction\nmay come mostly from demands of the limited\npartners.  A failing of the article is that it\ndidn't explain the crucial role of traction.<p>Third, as in the article, there are some cliches\nabout 'innovation':  It's very expensive in time and\nmoney, very risky, done for its own sake just for\nthe fun of seeing amazing things, is from dedication\nto change the world and not for ROI, is impossible\nto evaluate, is largely separated from business and\nreality, etc.  To save space here, I omit 1-1\npairings of each of these cliches with parts of the\narticle.  Exercise:  Do the pairings.  Hint:  They\nall exist.<p>So, it is easy for the venture partners to be afraid\nof innovation, to fear that it is an interest and\ndirection in conflict with ROI and not an advantage.\nWith this fear, traction and innovation are worth at\nmost just the traction alone and otherwise maybe\nsignificantly less.<p>Fourth, information technology (IT)\nentrepreneurship, from both sides of the table, has\na problem with 'patterns':  There aren't useful ones\neasy to see just from the past 40 years.  Why?  The\nexamples of big successes are, say, Square,\nPInterest, InstaGram, Twitter, Facebook, Google,\nYahoo, HotMail, Cisco, Oracle, Seagate, HP, Dell,\n..., Microsoft, Intel.  So, get such a big win maybe\nless than once a year; in 10 years get only a few\nbig wins; then in the next 10 years technology has\nchanged so much that the empirical patterns from the\npast 10 years don't work very well.<p>Fifth, the cliches in the article about technology\nare too pessimistic.  E.g., if innovation in\ntechnology is so risky and unpredictable, then how\ncome it has done so much in the last 40 years?  I\nmean, we're talking a 3.0 GHz 8 core processor for\nless than $200, main memory for $10/GB, a 3 TB hard\ndisk for $135, 1 GbE on each motherboard, 100 GbE on\none wavelength on a fiber with dozens of\nwavelengths, etc.  No, there are some reliable\n'patterns' as illustrated by the technology\nadvances.<p>The pattern?  Pick a pair of a problem and a\nsolution.  The problem should be such that a good or\nmuch better solution will get eager users/customers\n(want no doubts about 'product/market fit').  For\nthe crucial solution, innovate, e.g., do some\nresearch in applied mathematics, applied science, or\nengineering.  How to do such research?  There is\neducation for that, long heavily funded mostly for\nUS national security.  The education is available at\nthe top two dozen or so US research universities and\nis called a Ph.D.<p>For more on this 'pattern', look at the progress in\nIT of the last 40 years, say, from when Intel got\ngoing, along with what the US DoD has done starting\nearly in WWII to the present.<p>Risky?  Not really:  Mostly can eliminate nearly all\nthe risk with just good technical work just on\npaper.  And before that paper is written, one of the\nlessons usually learned in a good Ph.D. program is\nhow to pick a suitable problem where 'suitable'\nmeans can get results that are ""new, correct, and\nsignificant"" with the meager time and other\nresources available to a Ph.D. student.  For the\nneeded innovation just want ""new, correct,\nsignificant, powerful, and valuable"" for the needed\nsolution within the time and money available.<p>Expensive?  Not always.  DoD and NASA projects tend\nto be expensive due to some heavy hardware, but not\nall innovation is expensive.  E.g., RSA.<p>But generally the crucial work should be done and on\npaper in good form before allocating a lot of\nresources.<p>The solution?  IT entrepreneurs need to do better\ninnovation with nearly all the risk removed by work\njust on paper (or in PDF).  The venture partners, if\nthey want to invest, need to be willing to evaluate\nwork on paper and invest at that 'stage'.<p>But there is now a threat to the venture partners:\nNow the computing is so cheap that by the time a\nproject has the traction that venture partners want\nto see, there is a good chance that the project is\nalready nicely profitable.<p>E.g., suppose an entrepreneur does some innovation\nto get a powerful, valuable solution to a big\nproblem and brings up a Web site to deliver the\nsolution on the Internet.<p>Then look at the Meeker data at KPCB and average her\nCPM figures for mobile and desktop and get $2.125.\nAssume the Web site gets users enough to send 2 Web\npages a second with 4 ads per page.  Then in one\nmonth the revenue would be<p>2.125 * 4 * 2 * 3600 * 24 * 30 / 1000 = 44,064<p>dollars.  If each Web page sends for 400,000 bits,\nthe upload bandwidth needed is commonly available in\nUS living rooms from a cable TV company.<p>It is likely that a computer with less than $2000 in\nparts is sufficient as a server.  And can consider\nusing cloud servers.<p>So, we're looking at a project with a $2000 chunk of\nhardware, an Internet connection, with phone and TV,\nfor less than $200 a month, one or a few founders,\nand $44,064 a month in revenue.<p>Now why should such a project, sending 2 Web pages a\nsecond and getting $44,064 a month in revenue. call\na venture partner or return a venture partner's call?<p>Yes, this scenario has not yet resulted in a lot of\nbig wins, but the threat to venture capital and the\nopportunity to entrepreneurs is just sitting there.<p>Likely one good example is the romantic matchmaking\nWeb site in Canada, Plenty of Fish, long just one\nguy, two old Dell servers, ads just from Google, and\n$10 million a year in revenue.<p>An established pattern?  No.  Obvious?  Yes.<p>Note that I am saying that the opportunity is to (1)\nget a Ph.D. in applied math, applied physical\nscience, or engineering from a good research\nuniversity, (2) pick a pair of an important problem\nand a good or much better solution where the\nsolution can be generated from software running on\nservers and delivered to users/customers over the\nInternet, (3) for the solution do some innovation,\nthat is, some research in applied math, applied\nphysical science, or engineering, (4) write the\nsoftware, plug together the server(5), bring up the\nWeb site, go live, get publicity, users/customers,\nads, revenue, and earnings, and grow.<p>For the venture partners, they can (1) stay with\ntheir current ROI, significantly less good than an\nindex fund, (2) look for more mobile, social, local,\nsharing apps for teenage girls to gossip and look\nfor boyfriends, or (3) get serious about innovation\nand encouraging and evaluating it and then funding\nits exploitation.  No, venture partners should not\ninvest in research, but they likely will need to get\nquite serious once the research is solid on paper\nand, in particular, drop their scorn, contempt,\nridicule, and phobia about research.<p>Funding based just on paper?  That's how nearly all\nlarge engineering projects, DoD projects, etc. get\ndone.  Net, for what is crucial about innovation,\npaper is fine.",1362954265

The stack issue comes down to this; C uses the assembly (i.e. machine) stack. It is an almost ridiculously simple mechanism ideally suited to pass parameters and allocate 'automatic' (yes this is a C term too) data. Avoid large aggregates and arrays on the stack because stack space is limited. Providing you adopt a conservative approach, you never have to worry, 90% of a 2K byte stack in a small embedded system is typically safety factor/headroom.<p>My personal view is that C offers a perfect tradeoff between simplicity and capability, it has a magical quality that has made it the most important single computer language for nearly 40 years and on into the forseeable future. Increasingly its importance is as a layer that more programmer friendly technology sits upon, but it's no less important for that.<p>I've read that the difference between chess and go (the oriental game, not golang) is that on Alpha Centauri if little green men play a game that resembles chess, they will almost certainly play a game identical to go. Go is simple enough it is almost inevitable. For me it's almost the same thing (I stress almost), with computer languages and C.<p>One final point; C syntax is ultimately a matter of taste. If you find this to be a completely obvious, correct and straightforward way of doing a non-overlapping C string copy;<p><pre><code>  while( *src )\n    *dst++ = *src++;\n  *dst = '\0';\n</code></pre>\nThen you 'get' C.

These trains travel over major bridges and under important buildings; the damage of such an attack could be enormous.<p>It has not happened yet, and hopefully it never will happen.  The bomb itself would probably be difficult to procure and transport to New York City without being detected by an intelligence agency.

You need a city with a critical mass of innovative, talented people <i>and</i> a low cost-of-living. California in the 1970s had that. I don't know what the 2013 analogue is, or if it's even in the US. The Midwest would qualify, but it's hard to raise any kind of money (VC, bank loans) out there.<p>When real estate is expensive, money dominates peoples' lives-- even seemingly wealthy people who still don't make enough to raise a family. When it's cheap, people focus on other things and money is just one thing in it.<p>I'm ideologically against expensive real estate. I think that the government should buy, build and own about 60% of housing and set the prevailing rent per square foot. Rich people will still have the ability to buy property and to rent or own nicer private housing, but the basic prevailing rate will be set. This actually doesn't bring along the negatives of price ceilings (shortage) because the government can also build more housing and transportation infrastructure to increase available supply. I think we should hold the government responsible for that. No one should have to pay more than 1/4 of post-tax income to live within 20 minutes of work.<p>The reason New York is expensive is that people like me-- ambitious, hard-working, extremely capable-- are able to find jobs here. People like me make the fucking city great. For each person like me, there are 9999 who want to be around (or employ, or exploit) people like me and they drive up the fucking rent.

In a perfect world, these proof-of-concept ideas would be the inspiration for an x-prize. The competition itself acts as a map forward which would generate a bunch of competition to tackle something, with a new industry established as the result.

Maybe we have been flying to different places.<p>""Secondly the reason commercial airlines are different from smaller planes and other bombing targets is because you can use one to kill tens of thousands of people""<p>Tens of thousands?  That's funny, because the largest terrorist attack on American soil involved airplanes and killed about 3000 people.<p>""You can't do that with a car bomb or crashing a small plane into a large one.""<p>I was replying to someone who claimed that the job of the TSA is to prevent an airline bombing.  Crashing a private jet into a commercial jet is a perfectly valid counterexample.<p>""And the fact you have these incidents at all should tell you that airline security is important.""<p>We had <i>one</i> successful attack, which was extremely well planned and extremely well coordinated.  We spend <i>billions</i> of dollars each year on the TSA.  Billions of dollars because of an event so rare that we can only point to one occurrence.<p>Meanwhile, millions of people ride urban transit systems in large cities every day, and none of them are subjected to even the most rudimentary security.  A subway train in New York has a capacity of over two thousand people, which is around how many would be on a packed rush hour train.  A single terrorist could kill a large number of those people by detonating a powerful enough bomb while the train is going over a bridge or through a river tunnel (and probably in many other places).  Yet despite that terrifying possibility, there are no body scanners, no bag X-rays, no shoe removal requirements, and no security lines at subway stations.<p>You can go ahead and cling to the idea that the TSA's airport security program is keeping us safe.  The reality is that their program does almost nothing to promote safety or security; it is all the work that you do not see that is keeping you safe.  The body scanners are not even a piece of the puzzle, they are a distraction meant to help people like you <i>feel safe</i>.",1362953137

Where Ono Sendai created the decks used to jack into the net and transport someones conscious online.<p>While the idea of navigating the internet in a way analogous to physically walking is clumsy - what we have with glass is the reverse. Where you have the immediacy of the internet available to your physical reality.<p>Banning the first iteration, even before its available, is already a lost cause. By the time we hit 2020 - Google will have done more to bring us to the Neuromancing reality than most, and we will have iteration N of Glass at that time - likely available to either ocular implants of lens overlays.<p>Having had my first child in 2004, where I saw that she would be 16 in 2020, the same age as I was when I was roleplaying the Cyberpunk character in 2020, I go back and forth on whether I think that the tech level available to her when she is 16 is going to be a good thing or a bad thing.<p>There are a lot of things that I have let go as they came about and chose not to be an early adopter of, but Glass is one that I can't wait to get my hands on. While I have no idea if I would want to imbue my entire life with Glass - as that sounds like a Bad Thing (TM) - One cannot deny how potentially revolutionary this will be to the world once truly widely available.<p>Whats more interesting to me, than the <i></i><i>banning</i><i></i> of Glass, is what the unseen reactionary responses, derivative and evolutionary apps and uses will be.<p>Iteration one has the small prism screen to the right. I predict this will be one of the first things to be extended by adopters who wish for full visual overlay.<p>Augmented full field vision is low hanging fruit. Glass will enable a true BIM overlay industry. (People like PlanGrid should be pissing their pants to get access to Glass, and if they are not - then they are far too short-sighted)<p>One thing I am keenly interested in trying is FPV training for things like martial arts.<p>Activities such as skiing, snowboarding, skydiving, etc are cool to watch from an FPV standpoint - but viewing an FPV of a long ride, great jump, etc will not necessarily be something a viewer can gain much more instructive value from, I believe.<p>However, as a martial arts instructor myself, I would like to see how an FPV view of some of the throws and holds I teach would be received.<p>TL;DR: Banning is a lost battle. in 2020 Glass will be a primary data interface to millions.",1362953068

* Secondary pulls x time later, where x doubles each time, up to a maximum value, y<p>y is the one that&#x27;s tricky to define. For us, it&#x27;s a value computed based on the frequency of update of similar URLs for that domain, the domain as a whole, similar content, and a few other bits and pieces. Essentially, our thinking is that if we can understand how alike any page is to another cluster of pages, we can use their average frequency of update to give reasonably likely initial values for x, and sensible thresholds for y. We also temper this with how much change there is, to determine whether the differences are something we care about.<p>Obviously, should the system notice that if its change timings are particularly outside where it&#x27;d expect given the cohort assigned, it&#x27;s then able to start moving around its comparison. An example would be a blog category page which updates so infrequently that it&#x27;s particularly unusual, or a page with a lot of social feeds on it where there&#x27;s a lot of flux constantly.<p>Works pretty well, but if anyone&#x27;s got a better solution I&#x27;d love to hear of it.",1434101634

Coinbase requires that you take a week off from work and work with them (I think unpaid, but perhaps you get contractor wages) on a project.  They&#x27;ve been widely criticized as exploitative here, with many people saying &quot;Why should anyone who has any choice at all agree to that?&quot;  They also open up a rats nest of legal & IP issues.<p>The best way to get a full-time position at Google - or most companies, really - is to get an intern or contractor position and then convert to FTE at the end.  Hiring rates are <i>way</i> higher for successful interns (and the interview process is shorter), because they have lots of people inside with first-hand experience grinding out code with them that goes directly into Google&#x27;s systems.  But getting that internship or contract itself often requires an interview...",1434099937

You set some limits, like once a minute to once a month. You can also adjust the multiplier, and instead of factor of 2 you use something like 1.2. This way you can adjust more precisely to the page&#x27;s update time.<p>Also headers and sitemap.XML can tell you how often the pages change.",1434099908

9704739,comment,9703500,9704696,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"I&#x27;m generally in favour of introducing applicatives, but I don&#x27;t think the code in the article is a good example:<p><pre><code>    (bid, now) <- liftIO $ do
        b <- randomIO
        n <- getCurrentTime
        return (b, n)

    (bid, now) <- liftIO $ (,)
        <$> randomIO
        <*> getCurrentTime
</code></pre>
The applicative code could be considered better, since it avoids one-shot variables. However, that&#x27;s not the biggest smell with this code. To me, the problems are:<p>- Constructing-then-destructing a pair; is it really necessary?<p>- Use of `$`; is there a way to avoid having to alter the precedence?<p>- Combining two seemingly unrelated actions into one; `randomIO` should be completely uncorrelated to the current time, so why put them in the same action?<p>- Potential laziness issues; it looks like we&#x27;re using the `(bid, now)` combination to ensure the two IO actions are executed together, but will they be? WHNF will give us `(_ , _)`; if we force `bid`, will `now` also be forced?<p>Not saying I have answers to these, but I would say those are more &quot;smelly&quot; than the do-notation with a return",1434099709

They&#x27;re generally self-insert fantasies or power fantasies or wish-fulfillment fantasies.<p>The other problem is that writing often interrupts the fantasy. The flow in one&#x27;s head is often very different than the flow of a book and that translation process often takes effort, especially if one is prone to revising the fantasy as one goes along. Worse, once a fantasy is done, one might be able to go back and retrieve it. Creative writing and fantasizing are really different &#x27;skills.&#x27;",1430411609

Recent surveys of programming languages have ranked Java as the second most widely used programming language after JavaScript.<p>Java is a strongly-typed &quot;classical&quot; object-oriented language with C-like syntax. These characteristics make it an ideal foundation upon which to build your knowledge of programming.<p>Many of the newer and more popular languages deviate from the &quot;classical&quot; way of doing things. For example, many are loosely typed. Some use a simpler syntax without semicolons or curly braces. Others have a non-traditional OO model, or a hybrid OO / functional model.<p>You will likely encounter problems if you skip over the &quot;classical&quot; style languages and head straight for something like Ruby or JavaScript. For example, when you start to get into the more advanced parts of JavaScript, all of the books and tutorials explain things by contrasting with Java or C#. Therefore, if you don&#x27;t have that classical knowledge, the comparisons will be meaningless.<p>If you start with a loosely typed language, you won&#x27;t understand why your JavaScript developers are debating using TypeScript, or why your Ruby devs are debating switching to Java or Scala to build the app to scale. If you start with Ruby or Python you will never be comfortable with languages that use curly braces and semicolons.<p>I started out by learning PHP. It was a mistake. If I could go back in time I would have learned Java first. When I started to learn object-oriented programming it was tough because I had to unlearn the procedural way of thinking which was very common amongst PHP developers at the time.

Or Scala&#x27;s Play, or Java&#x27;s Spring. But probably not anything implemented in Go.<p>There are good reasons for this. Go lacks generics and has to use reflection as a crutch to match Rails for flexibility.<p>C# ASP.NET MVC on the other hand I think is probably the best match, in fact I think it actually might be superior to Rails in many ways.<p>Namely, like Go it is statically typed. However unlike Go it has powerful polymorphic capabilities in the form of interfaces and generics. Go can only have generic data structures built into the language, they can not be built as libraries. C# however has all of it&#x27;s collections implemented as library code (though they may be in the std lib like System.Collections).<p>One might argue Go has great concurrency support, however C# has just as good concurrency support if not better. C# supports async/await, Task based concurrency, native threads, various thread pool implementations etc. It&#x27;s primary web framework ASP.NET MVC is fully concurrency aware and uses a M:N request to thread model making use of async IO.<p>The tooling is even better than Go, Visual Studio and Resharper might cost money but they are worth what they cost.
Gofmt is great, but VS/Resharper can automatically format C# code. VS can also connect to running processes and interactively debug them, even remotely. There are tools for decompiling and working with the bytecode format (MSIL). There are great profilers and monitoring systems that run on the runtime (AppDynamics is great).<p>Most of this is true of the Java runtime and Spring/Play also. I am just less familiar with them.<p>The point is Go is not great for this in it&#x27;s current form, there are better alternatives.",1430409895

9465917,comment,9463894,9463894,0,0,coherentpony,,,"> Sure it&#x27;s helpful to cover the earth in 3m squares with unique names ...<p>I&#x27;m actually not convinced.  Squares don&#x27;t tessellate a sphere; you have singularities at the poles.  Sure, there aren&#x27;t many people living there, but it&#x27;s important to think about the limitations of this approach.<p>If you think this is really just an edge case, remember that projecting a square onto a sphere necessitates some distortion.  You can choose to distort angles or distances, but you have to choose one.  For distances, well, a &quot;3m x 3m&quot; square becomes essentially meaningless.  The problem gets worse when you increase latitude.  Canada, northern Europe and Russia are especially prone to this problem.  The same argument applies to locations in the Southern hemisphere as well.",1430409885

Do you want to mislead a racist into interviewing or hiring you?<p>Besides that, I&#x27;m really tired of the cancer that is the anticipation or expectation of racism.<p>I understand there are lots of examples of racism on a regionally wide scale, and that there are hotspots. For the localities suffering from racism: it&#x27;s inexcusable, tragic that some are so far behind the 21st century and no doubt badly wanting of immediate remediation.<p>Absent some circumstance where this kind of conscious behavior modification is clearly required, why would anybody do this? It&#x27;s disingenuous, dishonest and not a reflection of who you really are. Besides that, it frames the entire situation in this defensive &quot;here comes the racism&quot; posture that isn&#x27;t healthy or likely to help anybody.<p>I truly believe the racism/sexism blinders are traps. That&#x27;s not to say they don&#x27;t exist but the existence of the concept sometimes itself harms the subject group. I completely understand that some people characterize others based upon origin, sex, belief system, or background. But so what? Those people lack the ability to reflect upon their own beliefs or have broken morals; neither of which makes them someone you&#x27;d want to befriend, work with or work for.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be better to never show up for an interview because you weren&#x27;t invited because you mentioned the NAACP, rather than have a bad experience at the interview?<p>Rather than believing in racism, believe in excellence and push yourself to excel. Any employer you&#x27;d want to work for will appreciate diversity in its staff, and they&#x27;re not going to be looking for someone who&#x27;s merely mediocre regardless of their race.",1430409808

Just like you can&#x27;t change your money on your bank account, but you can send instructions to send money (keyboard input), and your client-side app will likely immediately update your balance even if it&#x27;s not fully processed yet by the server.<p>Beyond that, computing vectors of a few players isn&#x27;t really a big deal for a server, with 20 players you&#x27;re really running a relatively simple simulation without any rendering.<p>Data on the network is the bottleneck. And it&#x27;s far more efficient to send e.g. a &#x27;player pressed Forward&#x27; on second 0, and &#x27;player released Forward&#x27; on second 8. That&#x27;s two messages, as opposed to a 30-60 frames per second update on the player&#x27;s position.<p>So for security and performance, it&#x27;s usually not that great of an idea for clients to do all that much computing. One day we might even see rendering happen serverside, too, OnLive got it to work pretty well at low-res but it was far from optimal. (they shut down btw)",1430409632

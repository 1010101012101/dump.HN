Mz,2,13032,2.27273,1138,4509,"I have started a public Twitter list called Women of HN. If you are a female member of HN, let me know if you wish to be added.<p>https://twitter.com/TalithaMichele/lists/women-of-hn<p>My actual name is Michele.<p>Why Michele is not my HN handle: http://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/2014/03/mz-not-feminist-handle.html<p>Gmail: talithamichele<p>Twitter: @TalithaMichele<p>My websites:\nhttp://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/p/my-sites.html<p>Me and Math:\nhttp://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/2015/08/me-and-math.html<p>---------------<p>On 01/29/15, my karma hit 10k. I believe that makes me the only woman here with karma in the 5 digits. If you would like to promote gender parity on HN:<p>If you are a female lurker, please open an account and start exercising your right to vote. Upvote articles you like. Upvote comments you like.<p>If you actively participate as an openly female member, here is the general formula I have followed for participating in discussion in good faith while minimizing the gender issue: http://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/2014/01/oh-my-god-its-girl.html<p>Whatever your gender, try to post more good articles by women about substantive topics, such as this one that spent a good bit of time at #1, got a lot of upvotes, and generated good discussion:<p>A story about <input>  \nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10433793<p>I feel there is too much focus currently on women complaining about how they are treated and too little focus on actual accomplishments by women or on the work we actually do. I would like to see more positive attention focused on the work we do, less negative attention on &quot;women whining&quot; or attention focused on us &quot;because we are women per se.&quot; I think that only keeps the problem entrenched.<p>If you are a man, talk to women here about substantive, meaningful topics. Debate their ideas without being ugly or making it personal. Spare them the condescending pats on the head. In short, try to treat women like respected members of the community, here to discuss interesting topics, just like you would a man. (Please don&#x27;t hit on us publicly on HN. See my somewhat angry diatribe if you want to understand why: http://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/2015/10/dont-ask-me-for-date-in-front-of-100k.html)<p>A big <i>Thank You</i> to the many people who seem to be doing more of the above good things these days.<p>If you have questions that are not answered by the Guidelines:<p>https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html<p>or FAQ:<p>https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html<p>do not hesitate to write to the new moderator, Dan Gackle (pronounced &quot;Gackley&quot;):<p>https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dang<p>He has been consistently helpful, respectful, polite and patient in the face of my questions about proper titling and the like. I could not have roughly doubled my karma in 2014 (IIRC: going from about 4500 to something over 9000 points) without his very valuable feedback.\n---------<p>FYI:<p>I am still on the lookout for better terminology than &quot;Old Boys Club&quot; or &quot;Boy Zone&quot;. I loathe the expression &quot;The Patriarchy&quot; and I think it mostly does not fit the issues of gender disparity seen on HN. I can think of one or two men here who strike me as staunch supporters of &quot;The Patriarchy,&quot; but I think most men here are not actively trying to keep &quot;little women&quot; in &quot;their place.&quot; They are mostly just human beings, who happen to be male, who don&#x27;t know a better answer than the crappy situation we currently have. But, then, most women don&#x27;t have better answers either and have much more vested interest in finding such answers. I see no reason to vilify men for such a prosaic shortcoming of happenstance.<p>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9152104<p>----------<p><i></i><i></i>Recommended Reading on Gender and HN:<i></i><i></i><p>Some Raw Data on the Prominence of Women on HN\nhttp://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/2015/01/some-raw-data-on-prominence-of-women-on.html<p>Oh my god, it&#x27;s a girl!\nhttp://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/2014/01/oh-my-god-its-girl.html<p>Lessons learned as a girl gamer\nhttp://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/2015/10/lessons-learned-as-girl-gamer.html<p>In Search of a More Constructive Answer\nhttp://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/2015/10/in-search-of-more-constructive-answer.html<p>Don&#x27;t Ask Me For A Date in Front of 100k People\nhttp://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/2015/10/dont-ask-me-for-date-in-front-of-100k.html",1248010177,1452809385

23426,comment,23390,23390,0,0,phil,,,"I'm pretty skeptical too. I don't think Clay gives nearly enough credit to people's ability to learn new things and forget the past.<p>I asked the two nearest people (one young, one old) the VCR/PC and radio/phone questions. The old one answered telephone without hesitation, and had to think about VCR. The young one did just the opposite. And, Mike Ramsay was in his 40s when he started Tivo.",1179682606

23423,comment,23236,23236,0,0,especkman,,,"Is rejection of authority more common now?  The stereotypical Millennial (according to marketers and social scientists who do lots of polling) has more respect for authority than either ""Gen Xers"" or baby boomers.  <p>The same people will argue that todays 20-somethings are more collaborative and also less patient.  One could argue that these latter characteristics might foster entrepreneurship.<p>What I think is most important is:
1.  Demographics. There are a lot of ""young adults"" these days, and typically the young have a greater tolerance for risk.  They typically don't have mortgages or kids.<p>2.  Expectations. ~15 years ago we saw the first wave of ""downsizing.""  Previously, people had reasonable expectation  that if they were loyal to their employer, their employer would be loyal to them. Todays young adults have no such expectation, and many of them have witnessed the aftermath of putting too much faith in an employer both through their parents and grandparents.<p>3. Declining needs for capital.  It's been said repeatedly, but it's just so much cheaper to start up a company.",1179681160

They are all tiny blips on my radar, popping up once every year in some obscure article. Does anybody have experience with them, and are they worth learning?

23420,comment,23390,23390,0,0,mdakin,,,"The world is not a bag of marbles and it didn't change over night.  <p>Making something people want involves two main constraints: the making and the people.  <p>Human nature has remained constant for thousands of years (read some of the Latin or Greek or Chinese classics and you'll likely agree).  <p>The art of 'making' is shifting faster but perhaps not as fast as some people try to make it seem.  Lisp is a 50 year old technology and it's still viable today.  The Internet is 45 year old technology and we're still only beginning to realize its potential.<p>If you are a smart, flexible person doing something you love  ""experience"" will only make you more effective.",1179680577

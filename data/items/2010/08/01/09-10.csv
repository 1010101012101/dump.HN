I've also had one server from LeaseWeb but they are more expensive and comes with less services.<p>I'm interested in cloud hosting like Amazon EC2 or VPS like SliceHost, especially because I want to have my servers in more than only one country but so far all the solutions I found were not as great and/or cheap than the ones I use.<p>Here are some links for specific low cost servers:<p><a href=""http://www.kimsufi.co.uk/ks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kimsufi.co.uk/ks/</a> - OVH, great and cheap little servers!<p><a href=""http://www.ovh.co.uk/products/rps_offers.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ovh.co.uk/products/rps_offers.xml</a> - OVH, great too but no disks, they use iSCSI which is better because it removes hard drive failure risks but with bad disk performance costs.<p><a href=""http://www.online.net/serveur-dedie/comparatif-des-offres-de-location.xhtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.online.net/serveur-dedie/comparatif-des-offres-de...</a> - Online.net, the other good french hosting company for dedicated server.<p>BTW until now most of my servers were hosted at my home but I'm moving to another country, this will not be possible anymore, too bad!

1565007,comment,1564761,1564886,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""Since starting my own business, I've had to deal with RBLs probably 3 or 4 times a year. Not super often, but I don't have a really massive list of clients yet either.""<p>So, this is more than I come in contact with RBL issues by a pretty good amount. I think about it occasionally because users ask how to tune their SpamAssassin rules regarding them, but that's usually not in response to any problem.<p>But, what I find interesting is that something you deal with 3 or 4 times a <i>year</i> is considered a big deal, and worth throwing out the whole RBL system over (which, as I noted, I do consider a reasonably useful addition to a spam filtering system). I can think of a significant number of things I have to deal with a lot more often on a mail server, even if I did have RBL troubles that often: bounces, software updates, spam filter tuning, fixing clamav (honestly, dealing with clamav accounts for probably 75% of my mail server related work), troubleshooting why a large mailing is going slow, user stuff, whatever. All of that stuff happens all the time. RBL issues are once in a blue moon, and usually triggered by some other issue that would have had to be dealt with anyway...getting listed in an RBL just made me aware of the problem sooner.<p>I've had to request de-listing twice that I can recall: Once for a new server that happened to end up on an IP that had been used by spammers. Once because of a pseudo-open relay (a web application had a hole that allowed mail to be sent to arbitrary recipients). In both cases it was fixed within the same day. I've also advised people on fixing open relays, DNS issues, among other things, over the years. I can't, at the moment, think of any false positives that I've dealt with directly or indirectly.<p>To add to the argument that RBLs aren't more trouble than they're worth, I'll mention a relatively recent issue in SpamAssassin that <i>did</i> effect a lot of our users, and our own mail server. There was a rule, distributed in the default RHEL/CentOS SpamAssassin package, that considered mail with a date in 20x0 to be too far in the future, and thus <i>very</i> spammy. When we ticked over into 2010, suddenly thousands of users weren't getting <i>any</i> mail (except a few spams that cleverly used dates in the distant past)...that's pretty dramatic. Easy to fix, but it effected a lot of people, and led to a couple dozen tickets and support queries in our forums. That one bug has caused more support request related to email than RBLs ever have. (And ClamAV tickets/queries still far outnumber any other aspect of our mail stack, even after the SpamAssassin 20x0 debacle.) We obviously aren't throwing out SpamAssassin just because a few problems pop up now and then.",1280654893

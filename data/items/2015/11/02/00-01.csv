We switched over to using slack for projects and for work and everything got instantly better. It takes seconds to setup and destroy places to chat that are private.  It also takes seconds to search your entire history, on any device, and find what you talked about 3 weeks ago.  Sharing code that doesn&#x27;t get removed is amazing.  It&#x27;s a pain in the ass when the IRC client removes code and tells you nothing.

Feminist psychology chalks up this indirect aggression to internalizing the patriarchy.</i><p>That doesn&#x27;t sound even vaguely right.

Specifically, people can be intentionally misled and that by itself is actually a good reason to initiate coercion.<p>Also, cannot every coercion be interpreted as a retaliation for something? Does the fact that someone initiated a coercion at some point give the other party right to infinite (sanctioned by you) retaliation? Conversely, cannot anyone facing retaliation defend himself by saying (in attempt to get help) that this is initiation?<p>I simply think you cannot absolutely reject initiating coercion and accept retaliatory coercion..

10489264,comment,10477078,10477078,0,0,dan31,,,"The question here is really &quot;When do you need distributed transactions&quot;? One of misuses is when one cannot achieve enough performance on a single node. E.g., one builds a system serving 1000 REST requests per second (RPS), achieving 2 seconds latency per request, having a DB as a bottleneck. To be honest, I&#x27;ve seen real software built giving 23 sec latency per only 50 RPS. Does it mean there is a need to scale it out or simply that a chosen DB is a problem? The cases I&#x27;ve seen through my practice are mostly on the latter.<p>Simply choose the most suitable solution, not the most hyped one. A mistake would be to sacrifise transactions via using some &quot;general NoSQL database&quot;. Today, for real, you can have a single node capable of millions RPS on real-world scenarios with ACID transactions of arbitrary complexity, choosing solution like <a href=""http://starcounter.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://starcounter.io/</a>. Please, please don&#x27;t just take yet another no-transactions DB, which is no-transactions even on a single machine, having 4 db nodes on 4 cores completely separate as if they&#x27;ve been 4 different machine. Then you observe bad performance and start to scale things up, paying more and more for the cloud. Not the best idea to spend time and money.<p>And, if you DO really need distributed transactions, then it mostly means they&#x27;d be driven by a logic of your subject domain. E.g., you might have one department in Sweden, one in the USA, then you need to manage distributed accounts in the right way, where &quot;right&quot; is up to your banking policy. However, if you need to scale reads, there is just no problem of doing so within &quot;no-distributed-ACID&quot; solution. The same time, if you need to scale writes, doing distributed transactions isn&#x27;t a good idea either, as you&#x27;ve seen from the topic starter article.<p>So, right tool for the right job.<p>Outside of the brackets I keep a topic of fighting with latency via distributed transactions. I mean those things around caching, CDN and async replication. Distributed transaction isn&#x27;t a remedy there at all, since it doesn&#x27;t patch speed of light by any means.",1446425248

I am reminded of an archaeology article I read a while back about a Roman village. The village was home to a large silver mining industry. As such, the people there prospered. The empire grew. But at the same time they poisoned their water supply. There was much suffering.<p>I doubt it would be possible to remove most of the ecological changes (I will not use the loaded term &quot;damage&quot;) that economic growth has caused without us all living in bearskins and dying of measles by age 30. That&#x27;s not acceptable. So it&#x27;s always going to be a discussion about appropriate trade-offs. It&#x27;s been that way for all of recorded history, assuming the sky gods remain happy, all we have is this reasoning by induction to use on the climate question.<p>I am honestly at a loss to tell you what the stock market is going to do over the next year. I cannot tell you how the economy will fare over five years. I have completely no idea what changes technology will bring over the next decade or two. Asking for political consensus about what some folks _guess_ might be a few inches of sea level change over the next century? It&#x27;s simply a non-starter.  I don&#x27;t mean that in a pejorative way. I&#x27;m sure folks mean well and are acting in good faith. It&#x27;s just the entire line of argumentation is far too tenuous, shaky and relies way too much on emotional verve for me to get any traction on it at all. I see a lot of anger, haughty condescension, and political ugliness, but that&#x27;s just a terrific reason for serious scientists to have nothing to do with the advocacy part of this. There&#x27;s no there there.",1446424924

One is the process of formation of ice mass from snowfall, the rate of which has been steady for the past 10,000 years (this study has now measured it at 200 billion tons per year). This affects the total amount of ice across Eastern Antarctica and the interior. Unfortunately, this process has not _increased_ either.<p>The second process is the thinning of the glaciers. The rate of _this_ process has increased since 1992-2008 by 65 billion tons. As the article points out, if this continues, than Antarctica will begin to see a mass decrease.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure how this can be interpreted as a point against AGW, or what it has to do with the anthropogenic part at all, nor do I see how it can seen as evidence against simple GW (regardless of cause), as the melting process is still increasing. At best, it can be seen as evidence that things haven&#x27;t gotten out of hand yet. Now, if the Antartic snow growth was accelerating, then we could start arguing that we don&#x27;t need to worry about CO2 increases, as the planet will just compensate any shift with some (unknown) homeostatic counter process.

A lot of times when I speak to people about Russia they have a heavy western bias (not a bad thing) and I think it&#x27;s important to see both sides. A lot of times any Russian centric piece gets shot down.<p>As for your first point about Kievian rus being Russia: I think it&#x27;s different as up to the communist revolution, peasants in Russia had almost no idea of the change of powers and many didn&#x27;t even know the language they spoke was called. Most identified through Russian orthodox instead. The same kind of hold true today. I believe that if you asked most people in Russia, Ukraine (except I think modern day Ukraine would answer different than 30 years ago) they would say they are directly descended from the Kievian rus empire. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case with Rome and that is what makes it different. In the long term history of Russia, the current Ukraine is a small blip and Russia views itself as a thousand year old empire and wants to last another 1000 years so a decade or two of unrest is nothing  it took nearly 40 years of mass starvation and hunger before the communist revolution overthrew the czar.

I&#x27;m not completely sure about the details around this specific case, but historically we&#x27;ve had to restrict connections from similar software that makes N:N connections (or even N:M connections) to our network due to our connection limit rules quickly becoming unmanageable. We&#x27;ve recently implemented new software that should make this a little bit easier for us (and we&#x27;ve accordingly started being a bit more lax about it), but this is a fairly recent development.<p>Additionally, we hesitate to cater to this use-case as it often ends up turning into &quot;we want your network to relay messages between our bots&quot; instead of &quot;we want to talk to other people&quot;. We&#x27;ve found that channels used for such bots are typically not sufficiently staffed and frequently a target of abuse, which ends up taking network staff time to resolve.<p>Lastly, we&#x27;ve had a number of technical issues supporting certain pieces of IRC client software. Older versions of EiraIRC in particular have some nasty bugs; the worst of which is that they tend to get stuck in some state where they hold multiple connections to the network open while continuing to attempt to connect again and again, with no delay. While this doesn&#x27;t impose load that our servers can&#x27;t handle, it does generate a lot of administrative log traffic that is bogus and dilutes important log traffic.<p>Many of these use cases can be covered by IRC, but our network isn&#x27;t configured to handle such use easily as it often looks very similar to the sort of abuse we usually deal with. The common denominator in most cases like this is that it&#x27;s taking too much of the staff&#x27;s time and attention to support the channel and its clients. Our time is finite, and for the health of our network, we&#x27;d rather say &quot;no&quot; to a few channels than to make all channels suffer from thinner network staff resources.",1446423852

Can you blame them?&quot;<p>I said it was a failure and they should give up on it outside research. So, no, I support their decision. ;)<p>&quot; But then an explicit goal of the Hurd specifically was freedom from tyrannical sysadmin policy, which necessarily included freedom to host one&#x27;s own private namespace in a multi-user system that doesn&#x27;t affect the global namespace.&quot;<p>That makes sense, esp given the time it was made. Clouds, etc are still experimenting with models on that due to demand.<p>&quot;QNX was proprietary and didn&#x27;t have its architectural unveiling until work on Hurd was started.&quot;<p>And then they had the details they needed for the next 10-20 years. So, my memes about applying proven methods or not learning from the past may apply here.<p>&quot;KeyKOS&#x27; main selling point was the single store and the orthogonal persistence,&quot;<p>KeyKOS&#x27;s main benefits they touted were security/reliability w/ fine-grained POLA, high performance, and flexibility. One could even extend and share things in such a way that untrusted code couldn&#x27;t swamp CPU or memory. KeyKOS did in many use cases what Mach projects failed to do thanks to its design decisions and complexity. That&#x27;s despite experienced, brilliant kernel programmers working full-time on it. KeyKOS also had the two benefits you mention. So, building a KeyKOS-style kernel had huge benefits over a Mach kernel. That&#x27;s why Shapiro cloned it with EROS. I expect porting such attributes to this Mach project will also be (or were) hard.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s the communication boundary structure (and in Hurd&#x27;s case, port rights and auth server) that intrinsically create superior cases.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s isolation, resource management, and communication. They&#x27;re necessary for reliability and security as both involve components behaving badly. Also, for reliability, add in self-healing capabilities with at least monitoring and restarting of drivers. The last is a feature but the first three are baked into underlying architecture. The paper noted it lacked one for sure. Further investigation might find problems with the others.<p>&quot;Walfield and Brinkmann&#x27;s 2007 critique was done from the perspective of developers themselves. It wasn&#x27;t a general criticism of the Hurd, but one of specific problems related to resource accounting that other u-kernel and most monolithic kernel designs suffer from.&quot;<p>&quot;Implementing the POSIX API has nothing to do with the Hurd&#x27;s problems.&quot;<p>We might be reading different papers as there were several. Here&#x27;s the one I&#x27;m referring to:<p><a href=""http://walfield.org/papers/200707-walfield-critique-of-the-GNU-Hurd.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://walfield.org/papers/200707-walfield-critique-of-the-G...</a><p>It&#x27;s entirely about Hurd except when it&#x27;s critiquing Mach. It first describes the architecture and mechanisms. Then, it goes with the critiques. I&#x27;m ignoring those that show up anywhere and just require a tweak. The biggest, for reliability and security, is that it&#x27;s trust model is discretionary on app/process level: program inherits user&#x27;s privileges with no further limits and any reductions are at <i>program&#x27;s</i> discretion. Capability, MAC models, and even Windows Vista techniques counter threats in that space that Hurd wouldn&#x27;t challenge.<p>The next come from UNIX/POSIX compatibility & integration style. The filesystem shows how vanilla UNIX apps might break or require significant debugging due to UNIX assumptions that don&#x27;t apply. The server allocation problem with open is another but might be fixed if INTEGRITY RTOS&#x27;s brilliant defence is used: calling process donates its own CPU/memory for external functions. Would that break POSIX/UNIX behavior? Idk. Author follows up, though, by pointing out most things in Hurd have lots of ambient authority and would take modifications. These are usually due to UNIX compatibility. Note that ambient authority, along with its resulting downtime and hacks, we&#x27;re one of reasons UNIX was ditched for capability architectures by projects that built them.<p>They then look at Mach. One problem, optimization w/ predictable patterns, is indeed a general problem for microkernels this flexible and dynamic. This flexibility also makes for unpredictable delays. That&#x27;s why most microkernels are static and/or optimized on critical parts. Mach also lacked secure management of global resources in such a dynamic system. Authors mention KeyKOS/EROS which didn&#x27;t have that problem. There&#x27;s others but those were best at this IIRC.<p>So, the paper and it&#x27;s problems were mostly specific to Hurd and its usage of Mach. In each case, it&#x27;s an open problem about how to fix that in Hurd while each are a done deal in one or more competing technologies. Mach and UNIX compatibility either prevent the fix or make it quite difficult. So, these should count as Hurd/Mach problems caused by their specific design(s).<p>&quot;Relative to the state of the art, it is not, but then so do QNX and MINIX 3 make sacrifices.&quot;<p>They do. Not calling them perfection, either. However, they intentionally make choices that make their job easier at kernel, architecture, and API levels. Good engineering involves making right tradeoffs rather than setting oneself up to fail. That&#x27;s my problem with Hurd if judging against its goals but in exploration mode they just need to make progress. Or make changes.<p>Note: I do disqualify the two from the secure attribute due to their compatibilities and QNX&#x27;s UNIX code got it smashed first time an online presence was publicized. Reliability, performance, resource management, and UNIX/POSIX integration? Among best in class.<p>&quot;The fundamental issues with the Hurd then have little to do with the 2007 critique. More pressing is its incompleteness&quot;<p>That&#x27;s another issue on top of the fundamentals I referenced earlier. We&#x27;re probably going to learn about some more side effects of them when they add Rump kernels assuming monolithic UNIX to the mix. It&#x27;s still a good move on their part, though, and would bring lineage full circle.<p>&quot;f all else fails, using rump drivers on a heavily stripped Linux with Mach module emulation to create a true hybrid kernel, coupled with functional package management and system state management via Guix with added on orthogonal persistence and network transparency could be another future direction for the Hurd I might end up exploring.&quot;<p>Now, that sounds like the hacked together, against-all-odds, balls-to-the-wall solution I like to see! Although above issues will affect multi-user part: specific examples were already cited. Might be fine if they&#x27;re <i>benign</i> users. So, build the monstrosity and make it work! :)<p>&quot;I would not see it as a huge bottleneck (only an inelegance) and in the hybrid case it becomes irrelevant beyond as a programming API, which it isn&#x27;t that bad of one.&quot;<p>In the past, it was a bottleneck but people thought the API was fine. So, it will be interesting to see what happens on containerized, multi-tenant, IPC-heavy workloads. On it vs alternative schemes.",1446422732

I&#x27;m disregarding the numbers and stock prices and think about what&#x27;s <i>really</i> happening, and what shifting all this capital <i>means</i>. I am putting on two hats at once to connect these financial actions with reality. The answer clearly depends on the caveat described below. If coal can produce power and the economic gain can be profitably allocated to counter environmental and societal damage, then leaving the coal in the ground is the loss that will be incurred when billionaires sell their stock and purchase land rights. That loss will be shared by everybody. Hundreds of thousands of companies&#x27; costs will go up, and their profits reduced, due to reduced electricity supply or increased cost of electricity, and their stock prices <i>will</i> be reduced. Production that is marginally profitable will be wiped out. That is the answer. Just like the world would lose out if Sergey and Larry didn&#x27;t start google. In that alternate universe, the market capitalisation of stocks that rely on search engines would be lower.<p>[1] With the caveat being the coal could be used to produce enough extra electricity in conjunction with other forms of electricity generation to counter it&#x27;s own negative effects.

In Sweden, even alcohol is a controlled substance and you may recall pressure being put on NL for allowing foreign people to consume cannabis in coffee shops (mainly in Amsterdam), well that pressure was from Sweden who saw the practise as a way for Swedes to get around their laws by flying to Amsterdam for a weekend (although just across the border in Copenhagen, a Swede can buy cannabis at Christiana, it isn&#x27;t legalized or officially decriminalized, but the police only enforce a few arrests every few years as long as there is no violence or other drugs, no such pressure was placed on Denmark).<p>It is a throwback to notions from the 19th century, puritanical christian Sweden where the notion was that Swedes have an &#x27;addict gene&#x27;.<p>You can legally have sex with animals though, it isn&#x27;t even seen as cruel, the thinking back in 1945 when bestiality was legalized with sodomy was why should an otherwise good man be plagued because he has sex with animals (or homosexual sex). Obviously this thinking wouldn&#x27;t fly in other western nations as the concept of cruelty and consent are very different. I think they are in the process of changing this now, so maybe in a few years they will fall in line with other aspects of international policy as well.",1384264788

6717792,comment,6716399,6717655,16,0,pron,,,"This is another problem with Haskell: comments like this. But in order to be helpful, let me explain why.<p>> technically Haskell is non-strict, not lazy.<p>Now, see, I don&#x27;t care. Neither does anyone really other than PL researchers. I mean, I can care in my spare time if I like spending it on PL research, but when I write a 2 MLOC software for a large customer, I couldn&#x27;t care less whether &quot;technically&quot; it&#x27;s &quot;non-strict&quot; or &quot;lazy&quot;. As far as I, the programmer, is concerned, it&#x27;s lazy. If one must be this familiar with PL jargon in order to program Haskell, then this is a problem.<p>> but don&#x27;t pretend its a feature of humanity. All runtimes come with assumptions.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not trying to make a provable statement (how does that joke go? you can tell if someone is a mathematician if everything they tell you is all true and all irrelevant). We&#x27;re talking software engineering, right? So what percentage of production code anywhere in the world is written in an eager (strict, whatever) language? If you tell me it&#x27;s less than 99.999%, then you&#x27;re being dishonest. 99.999% <i>is</i> a &quot;feature of humanity&quot;. If your point is that education can change people&#x27;s habit and way of thinking, I say, you&#x27;re absolutely right. Go for it, and we&#x27;ll talk again in 15 years.<p>> All runtimes come with assumptions.<p>Again, true but irrelevant. Some assumptions are more familiar and therefore feel more &quot;natural&quot;,and some are less so.<p>I wasn&#x27;t dissing Haskell. It&#x27;s a very impressive and elegant language.

6717787,comment,6716603,6716603,6,0,tokenadult,,,"I was glad to see that the recent article kindly submitted here gives the inmate count for Sweden, and Sweden&#x27;s population.<p>&quot;According to official data, the Swedish prison population has dropped by nearly a sixth since it peaked at 5,722 in 2004. In 2012, there were 4,852 people in prison in Sweden, out of a population of 9.5 million.&quot;<p>So I looked up my home state of Minnesota&#x27;s inmate count and population for a rough comparison.<p>&quot;State corrections officials are quick to point out that Minnesotas incarceration rate is the second lowest in the nation and to note how favorably Minnesota compares with our neighbor to the east. As of July 1, Minnesota had a prison population of 9,772 and a prison budget of $457 million a year. In contrast, Wisconsin has a prison population of about 23,000 and a prison budget of $1.2 billion.&quot;[1] Minnesota has a population of 5.379 million. In general, the state prison population in the United States is declining,[2] with Maine currently being the state with the lowest rate of incarceration, and Minnesota&#x27;s recently fluctuating rate being the second-lowest. Some states have much higher rates of incarceration, so the overall United States rate is high.<p>As the article submitted here suggests, and as the articles I&#x27;m linking here suggest too, all over the world it can reduce incarceration rates to not punish minor drug offenses \nwith incarceration. A determinate sentencing system that emphasizes severity of crimes like Minnesota&#x27;s[3] keeps first-time, nonviolent offenders out of prison and reserves prison for repeat offenders with known history of violent offenses.<p>How does Minnesota&#x27;s system work for me as a member of the public? I can walk all over my neighborhood feeling perfectly safe, and even my children can freely go out in public, walking for a radius of a mile or biking for a radius of four or five miles in any direction, without risk or fear.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2013/08/how-minnesota-can-reduce-its-prison-population"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2013/08/how-minnesot...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.startribune.com/local/216949031.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.startribune.com/local/216949031.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://mn.gov/sentencing-guidelines/images/2013%2520Guidelines.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mn.gov/sentencing-guidelines/images/2013%2520Guidelin...</a>",1384264426

To me this is the same as if he would wear that silly body builder costume with muscles poking out or the sumo wrestler suit.And by wearing those suits I don&#x27;t think it is derogatory to body builders or sumo wrestlers. It is about the person doing it making a joke of themselves because they just look ridiculous and funny when they do not appear as themselves. Walking in heels, wearing makeup, having lots of muscles on you or just lots of body mass (not to say fat) will make you walk awkward because you are not used to it.<p>There is a difference when you put on a muscle suit for a day and if you build up and have muscles every day (I wish) so it is not also about mocking the way how body builders walk (btw. the walk think is the only thing that comes to my mind if I was wearing one of those what would I think is funny on me about that, maybe there are also some other aspects why that would be funny).<p>So no, it is not degrading to dress up as any person, it is just for a laugh, at least in my case and how I perceive that. That said, if someone is making a joke not out of themselves but out of people they are dressing up as, that is not nice and not ok.<p>The real question is will you stop mean people being mean by banning and/or criticizing any dressing up or you will just kill off some harmless fun, while mean people still stay mean and find other ways to &quot;practice&quot; their meanness?",1384264394

The same thing scared me away initially (that was 8 years ago), but I&#x27;ve learned to love the power and complete flexibility that this platform offers.<p>Since we&#x27;re talking about messaging, try out the Private message module. Right off the bat, you&#x27;ll get a much cleaner form than the ugly node form. Private messages are also fieldable so you can add additional fields like attachments, labels, etc. Using the API (hook_form_alter()), you can do anything you want to any form at all. Then once you introduce a good theme, the possibilities are as endless as any other solution.<p>I&#x27;d also take a look at some of the Drupal 8 backported modules for Drupal 7 (if you&#x27;re going to use 7).

I think it was two months before I saw a light at the end of that tunnel - and only recently that I have really begun to feel as productive in Haskell as I previously was in Ruby. At this point, the costs you speak of are paid up and I do not incur them when I write new code. Yes the type system does impose a lot of structure and some boilerplate, but the benefits are profound. Its the sort of statement I did not really fully credit before experiencing myself, but I will say that is profoundly amazing how frequently my code works perfectly once it compiles. This is particularly true when refactoring. I remember sometimes in Ruby despairing to refactor some code because I didn&#x27;t want to fix all the tests...in Haskell once my tests are compiling they are passing, and the compiler errors are usually very easy to understand and fix (after several months of head-banging frustration).",1384263876

Until recently, there was only tepid attempts at hardware branded Microsoft where as Apple has always been hardware bound to software to the point you can&#x27;t easily install OSX on anything other than Apple hardware. The same cannot be said for Microsoft, the only other company that is bound by this rule of multiple defaults.<p>That rule came about because Microsoft had licensing rules that prevent devs from using MS software on their own hardware if that hardware included competing software. If you wanted to use Windows, you HAD TO use IE only. Microsoft was using monopolistic practices, but did not have a monopoly btw.<p>In a nutshell, Apple is selling a singular device that happens to have a doorway that allows users to install addition software to expand the hardware/OS beyond its default intended (by Apple standards based on analyzing the user market) purposes.<p>Other alternatives are hardware solutions that allow your choice of software as middleware to gain access to the hardware functionality.

However, &quot;body image distress&quot; is real and it even\n   drives people to suicide [1]. Violence against transgender\n   people is very common as well. Homosexuality used to be listed\n   as mental disorders in DSM I and II, but was removed in\n   1974. &quot;Gender identity disorder&quot; was finally removed in DSM V\n   last year [2].

After all, if you&#x27;re selling $40k engagements, then adding ~10 qualified leads to the pipeline every month would easily sustain a small consultancy.  That&#x27;s not all that much calling.  As your consultancy grows you tend to collect recurring engagements / referrals organically, but if you absolutely positively have to make e.g. $2 million this year to cover all employee salaries, that&#x27;s still only one engagement a week, and if you&#x27;re counting in the millions you have throw-money-at-this-problem options to being tired of all the talking on the phone.",1384262176

Peyton Jones speaks in monads to his mother?). If this article was written in response of a talk between undergraduates in a TA session, it is perfectly acceptable, and even provides links to advanced material for the curious.<p>> A general definition of an object (following Cook somewhat) is something that satisfies an interface along with some form of dynamic dispatch. There is no reason why a function can&#x27;t fall under that definition.<p>Yes, but why have that definition, if you already have functions as builtin types? Conversely, if there&#x27;s a need for functions as builtin types, why force programmers in using that clunky alternative? That&#x27;s pretty much the point made by the article: don&#x27;t corner yourself in one paradigm when others might be better at some tasks.<p>> As several others have pointed out, the fact that Java doesn&#x27;t have proper first-class functions is also utterly irrelevant. In fact, it is possible to program in a very pure OOP manner in any language with proper closures.<p>Careful, the wording is a bit lacking here imho: you join two different ideas and make it seem like the second one validates the first, while it&#x27;s not the case.<p>> If the author is representative of the quality of researchers working on programming languages, it&#x27;s no wonder the field seems stagnant.<p>That shows you probably don&#x27;t follow much the field.

The vast majority of &quot;exotic&quot; order types fall into generally two categories:<p>1) Orders that help deal with the asynchronous nature of the market. Removing the restriction on locked markets can reduce the need for these orders, but with that restriction in place these orders are a net benefit IMO.<p>2) Orders that help a participant control how an order is filled. Post only, etc, to ensure one gets a passive fill vs taking liquidity.<p>There are no secrets here. These orders are all public.

That&#x27;s a very long shot from &quot;committed crimes&quot;. It&#x27;s really just only what people report, if it&#x27;s a crime or not. The number of reported crimes is most likely below the number of actual crimes for most crimes. It&#x27;s a statistic which must be regarded with big caution. It&#x27;s an indicator and as such has a value, but without context and analysis the number itself is basically meaningless. Take for example &quot;fraud with help of internet&quot; - that&#x27;s a crime that basically didn&#x27;t exist in 2003. It probably wasn&#x27;t codified in law until much later and it&#x27;s one of the fastest growing categories. Such changes skew the statistics, context is important. Even the reverse in trend may be due to external factors such as less people reporting drug abuse as a crime.",1384261278

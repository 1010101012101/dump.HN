600793,comment,600732,600732,0,0,chops,,,"Even though the author didn't like it, I quite liked the ultra-chaining approach presented.  So what if the readability relies too much on indenting, practically every language relies on indenting for readability (or the indenting actually has syntactical meaning like python).<p>Frankly, I found this example very neat and would love to see this in jquery.<p><pre><code>  $('div') 
    .when('click') 
        .addClass('active') 
        .text('Hey') 
    .done() 
    // Also possible with on() 
    .on('mouseout') 
        .removeClass('active') 
        .text('Ho') 
    .done();
</code></pre>
It relies on indenting for readability, just like everything else. I say go for it!",1241852163

600787,comment,600517,600604,0,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"I disagree with that.<p>Before Twitter came along, I would regularly change my IM status to a nice quote, a link to a nice news story or a link to a cool website. Many people do this. Twitter makes it easy to broadcast something like this to hundreds of people, makes it all searchable and encourages conversation. It serves as an outlet for random thoughts and observations that are too insignificant to fit into a blog post. A ""stream of consciousness"", if you will. Collectively, Twitter is the entire Internet's stream of consciousness.<p>I find Twitter is a great way for staying in touch, too. Why? Because it simple. Very, very simple.",1241851336

600785,comment,597549,600034,0,0,pfedor,,,"<i>You say ""the problem cannot be solved in classical electrodynamics"".<p>Firstly, I'm not sure I agree.</i><p>I would be happy to be proven wrong, but that's what I remember from studying physics many years ago.  You can calculate the motion of a charged pointlike particle in given fields, and you can calculate the fields produced by charged pointlike particles following any motions, but you can't calculate the effects of the interaction of a particle with its own field.<p>This said, I vaguely remember some tricks that involved arbitrary dropping of some infinite terms, a bit like renormalization in QED only not precisely defined in any way.  Perhaps with those tricks you can arrive to some kind of solution.<p><i>Secondly, can it be solved at all? Can you give me an algorithm that will solve this problem?</i><p>The interaction of a particle with its own field is tractable in quantum electrodynamics or so I was told. However, as you are no doubt aware, the state of a quantum-mechanical system is not really defined in terms of positions and velocities of a set of particles, so your problem taken literally doesn't make sense in this framework.  And even if you re-stated it in an appropriate language, quantum field theory won't give you the precise evolution in time of any system, typically the best you can hope for is a transition amplitude between non-interacting particles in time minus infinity and non-interacting particles in time plus infinity.",1241851231

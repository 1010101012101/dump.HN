I never quite understand why ANY Hindus should get upset when our religious/philosophical texts  are scrutinized and contextualized. Of course, all interpretations are subjective. But if nothing else we should all embrace the notion that there is no such thing as a Hindu heretic or apostate. What matters (and has always mattered) is how we live and act. As such, I would emphasize that it is also important to keep an open respectful dialogue without alienating people from the discussion.",1417042760

There are lots of places where it can improve your ability to understand the information around you.<p>If you&#x27;re reading a graph, you should be asking yourself a ton of questions about it. A lot of those questions can be answered with mental math if you&#x27;re proficient at it. If you weren&#x27;t, you&#x27;d have to resort to a calculator or other tool, and the switching cost keeps most people from doing this:<p>examples: what&#x27;s the ratio between these two values? How did it change? I have this per minute (or, in my case, a per 4 minutes) rate. What is that per day? How much did that drop by (absolute and relative)<p>The point isn&#x27;t that people who are bad at math can&#x27;t compute these things in the real world. They can, and often do, whether with calculator, on paper, slower in their brains, or with a different query or better analysis tool.

I think that the world would be better off if all websites were treated equally by all ISPs, but I also think the world would be better off if millions of people who have never had a computer before can have the access to information that we take for granted. Given that the WMF is unlikely to be able to change telecom policy or business practices in all these countries, I think it&#x27;s better to work within the existing system and provide a resource that would otherwise be costly (perhaps prohibitively so).<p>Having said that, many Wikimedians disagree with me.",1417039456

Bottom up where you learn gates and work your way up where your first project is feeding two switches on a dev board thru a single xor gate and light an LED with the gate output.  Systems integrator is also a valid path where you go to opencores and pull a soft core CPU (ranging from totally proprietary all the way up to GPL) and start with a dumb peripheral and make it smarter.",1417039436

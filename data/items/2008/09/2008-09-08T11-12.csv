298212,comment,297297,297476,0,0,gstar,,,"I hate Word.<p>I needed to print 300 address labels last night.  I tried outputting HTML in a table (evil), then I tried reportlab (more evil).<p>I ended up outputting them as csv and importing them into Excel and doing a mail-merge with Word.  Word even shipped with a template for the exact avery labels that I bought.<p>Web word processors have a long way to go.  I know Word is a kitchen sink, but it's a working kitchen sink.",1220875090

298203,comment,297863,297863,0,0,raganwald,,,"Forcing people to buy albums for more money than the single they really want is another way to disguise the concept of charging more for popular singles. That's the iTunes policy they really hate. The reason there are only a few ""complete works"" for sale on iTunes is that Apple won't let the labels call nine completely unrelated songs a ""work"" as a sleazy way to charge $6.99 or $9.99 for a Kid Rock single.<p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/11/18.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/11/18.html</a><p>p.s. Complete works"" are not rare in the classical music section. Perhaps the artists should  try actually composing a complete work--as prog rock did in the 70s--and seeing if Apple will see things their way?<p>I wouldn't argue if an album like ""The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway"" or ""Dark Side of the Moon"" was packaged as one movement per original LP side or even one big purchase.",1220874846

As to how the shares will trade today, that would depend on whether the market had already anticipated this move and priced it in.",1220874777

298197,comment,297681,297992,0,0,streety,,,"How far has the automobile industry advanced in the last 100 years?  Four wheels, petrol engine.  Personally I'm still waiting for my flying car.<p>Of course that could be slightly harsh.  The land speed record has been broken again and again in that time period.  That brings up an interesting point.  Only one of those attempts set out to break the speed of sound, all the rest set out to beat the last guy.<p>We need targets to aim for and any project which aims to pass the incumbent leader in 10 years will be a lot more politically valuable than a project which will reach Alpha Centauri in 50 years.  Even if they are the same project.<p>Having said that this discussion is entirely academic.  The proposal was made in 1988 and not followed up.  Today, we're just aiming for the Moon.<p>p.s.  Good luck solving whatever population problem there may be via space.  I wouldn't like to try shipping a billion people 100 miles.  Moving them to another world would need more than improvements to the space program.  It would need the space program to be made irrelevant.",1220874219

In my opinion, that does not matter at all. Driving a car responsibly is about predicting possible problems caused by other drivers and actively avoiding them. There are many bad drivers out there and until self-driving cars replace all of them, they have to be ready to deal with them.",1431917949
9562694,comment,9561895,9562254,0,0,dredmorbius,,,"<i>With rail -- a bit of engine trouble breaks the whole system.</i><p>That depends on how you engineer the system. With reasonably frequent crossings, you <i>can</i> route around stalled vehicles. If you&#x27;ve got dedicated rights-of-way (rather than mixed-mode auto-and-LRV routes) then wrong-side operations isn&#x27;t so critical.<p>With sidings or triple-tracking, you can offer only modestly degraded service, though at markedly higher initial cost and land use. Still far better than highway / surface-street designs.<p>Or you can &quot;bounce&quot; vehicles to either side of an outage, running service to the problem location and running truncated shuttle service on either side.<p>It&#x27;s largely a matter of political will, costs, and frequency of outages. Which, generally, even on less-reliable system aren&#x27;t exceptionally prevalent.<p>The other issue is that busses tend to fail (for various reasons) more frequently than rail.",1431917894
9562693,comment,9560119,9561945,0,0,dllthomas,,,"There&#x27;s two ways in which I&#x27;d like to address your questions here.<p>First, directly addressing the question you asked:<p>There are a number of libraries for assembling and manipulating a Haskell AST - I would recommend looking at haskell-src-exts and Template Haskell.  Unfortunately, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to exec any of these directly (at runtime).  You could obviously pretty-print and then eval that, which may or may not be a good fit depending on your problem space.<p>Separately, I would like to suggest a different perspective, in line with the thesis of the article.<p>(Pardon me if this gets a bit rambly, and feel more than free to ask questions if it gets confusing - I&#x27;ve been meaning to expand on this in a blog post...)<p>Haskellers are fond of monads.  Lispers are fond of S-expressions.  Lisp programs are S-expressions.  S-expressions are either an atom, or a list of S-expressions - a structure also known as a &quot;rose tree&quot;.<p>It turns out, a rose tree is a monad.  In particular, a &quot;free monad&quot;, which means there&#x27;s a unique function turning a rose tree into any other monad in a way that preserves structure (in math terms, a &quot;monad homomorphism&quot;).  Getting slightly speculative, I think the homomorphism from Free to IO has to be Lisp&#x27;s eval.<p>So in a senes, when Haskellers write functions that operate on &quot;Monad m&quot;, they are writing functions that can operate on Lisp programs, and also on many &quot;partial interpretations&quot; or &quot;restricted forms&quot; of Lisp programs.  This is why Haskell programmers get about as excited about monads as Lisp programmers do about macros - there&#x27;s a deep connection.<p>The big thing that Haskell lacks, in this context, is a mutable global namespace - which keeps a few things compile-time only (and hence the need for Template Haskell for fuller coverage of metaprogramming).",1431917863

There are quite a few papers, in case anyone is interested and unfamiliar with this sort of thing.<p>Another fun problem, probably better known, is sequential hat guessing:  take 100 people in a line, arranged so that each person can see everyone in front of them, but no-one can see any of the people behind them.  Everyone is given either a red or black hat to wear, but no one can see the color of their own hat, or the hat of anyone behind them.  So the person at the back of the line can see everyone&#x27;s hat but their own, the next person can see everyone&#x27;s hat except the first person and their own, etc.<p>Now starting with the back of the line, each person is asked to publicly guess the color of their hat.  The participants are allowed to agree upon a strategy, how many people can they guarantee guess correctly?<p>Things get crazy if you allow an infinite countable line of people, and put ear-muffs on anyone so that no one gets to hear anyone else&#x27;s guess.

If people and population centers are very spread out, then the transit becomes both more expensive and less useful.  Even if you can take rail between two population centers, odds are good that you&#x27;ll still have to drive a long way to the train station then drive another long way to get where you&#x27;re actually trying to go.  Because there&#x27;s not a lot of population, transit can&#x27;t run frequently without being a massive waste of energy, so schedules become less convenient.<p>Check out this density map:<p><a href=""https://dhs.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/popdensity.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dhs.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/popdensi...</a><p>Note how Europe is consistently dense over a very large area, with a core of highly dense areas all fairly close to each other like London, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Munich, and Bern, while the adjacent regions like Italy, the Balkans, and even Poland have fairly consistent population density.  In Japan, the density is highly concentrated on Honshu, and even then it&#x27;s concentrated into certain cities and prefectures.<p>The US, meanwhile, has only a few dense regions, mostly in the Northeast, with the rest of population centers spread out very large areas.  Not coincidentally, those more densely populated cities tend to have more public transit than the average American city.  There are notable exceptions, such as Los Angeles, but LA is not representative of most of the country.",1431915842

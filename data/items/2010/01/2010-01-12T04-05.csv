1046884,comment,1046301,1046721,0,0,patio11,,,"I think what you are saying is good advice, but don't think it is necessarily co-extensive with what I'm suggesting.<p>For example, say you're targeting teachers.  Keeping a laser focus on what teachers want is important.  However, I think you need to put <i>extra</i> focus on making their first five minutes absolutely amazing.  (And their first 30 seconds.  And their first 5 seconds.) My reason for this is simple: almost all apps are going to leak an amazing number of their customers between first and second use.  I don't have my report in front of me at the moment, but I think something like 40% of BCC users never complete their first bingo card and never log in again.  Essentially none of these people buy the software.  On the other hand, roughly 2.4% of trialers convert, or roughly 4% of users who succeed in their first interaction with the app.  Increasing my bottom line by 5% requires converting 5% more of that second group -- which, let me tell you, is <i>hard freaking work</i> -- or, in the alternative, improving the first run experience of <i>three</i> out of every 40 users who fail to complete Task #1.<p>It is really hard to optimize your entire application, user experience, value proposition, etc to get +5% conversion.  However, polishing your first five minutes until it freaking shines is not nearly as difficult.  Do you present people with a blank page currently?  Spend an hour and put something on it.  I will put money on that helping.  Does it take a critical mass of friends/input/lions slain to get fun?  Do the work for them.  Fake it if necessary.<p>And, yeah, instrument <i>everything</i>.  Can I plug Mixpanel here?  <i>plug</i>  Every time I think ""You know I should really build more instrumentation into my app..."" I remember ""Oh, wait, it takes a twentieth of the time to just throw it on Mixpanel -- no visualization code or complicated controls to refine the data range required, praise be.""",1263272117

1046867,comment,1046388,1046855,0,0,baguasquirrel,,,"The thing about mechanical inventions that made patenting important was that there was often a lot of hidden knowledge in their design.<p>If we take the familiar example of the ICE, simple dimensions like the bore and stroke of the cylinder aren't arbitrarily chosen.  Altering the ratio of the bore and stroke changes the revving characteristics of the engine (a somewhat larger bore than stroke will cause the engine to have a higher rev limit, for example), and increasing the size of the bore requires disproportionately heavier cylinder heads (because cylinder heads have to have some depth and lateral reinforcement).<p>The size and weight of the cylinder heads, combined with the  stroke effect the strength and dimensions required of the connecting rods and the crankshaft, so on and so forth.<p>Basically, a lot of mechanical ""inventions"" are big physics and engineering puzzles where the mere dimensions of each part was worked out through a lot of equation crunching (and probably a lot of plain old tinkering and testing as well).

While many may argue that it can afford to lose customers who carry very low balances, those customers are also the source of their very large fee revenue.  It’s the long tail - 80% of customers with a low balance paying fees to maintain accounts that pay for the technology innovation, maintenance and new products enjoyed by the 20% of customers enjoying free or low-fee accounts.  Wells Fargo (like all banks) cannot afford to rely on traditional investment carry at today’s interest rates.

They processed a credit card payment (to themselves!) which sent me slightly into the red before my paycheck on the same day. This was the second time this occurred. The first time, a decent CSR returned the fee. The second time, I was denied.<p>Instead of calling again for another CSR, I decided to just go to a physical bank to talk with a manager. She said that the case was ""already decided"" and there was nothing she could do about it. She said she would have fixed it if only I hadn't talked to a rep on the phone first.<p>I immediately withdrew all of my money and closed the account, thinking that maybe she'd fix things before I got through with that. Apparently, she really couldn't do anything. Now I'm with Wachovia. I had been with BofA for 10+ years before closing the account. Things are fine with Wachovia so far but I expect that, eventually, they'll end in similar fashion.<p>I also learned during this whole process that they'll send you an alert AFTER you go into the red but not before an automatically scheduled payment is set to go through that would put you in the red. That would have been nice since I could have delayed paying the credit card account until I was sure that the paycheck would be processed. Of course, such an easy-to-implement system would reduce the late fees they rake in. My new bank has the same set-up.",1263271384

I'm glad you found this post useful.<p>I think I should have given more attention to use cases of `delete` before delving into all the details of how it works :) My bad.<p>I wouldn't say using `delete` is almost always the wrong approach, but it is certainly often misunderstood. There are valid use cases where one needs to delete a property, usually before iterating over an object (and performing some operation on each of the remaining properties), or when using `in` operator to detect property existence. Note that simply assigning `undefined` doesn't delete property — it is still visible during iteration or when inspecting object with `in`/`Object#hasOwnProperty`.<p>In practice, I immediately think of event abstraction, where `delete` is often useful. In fact, jQuery uses it just for this kind of purpose — <a href=""http://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L158"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L15...</a>.<p>In Prototype.js, there are also a couple of places where we use `delete` (such as to delete a property from an object for some special purpose (take care of IE bug) and then iterate over the remaining properties of an object — <a href=""http://github.com/sstephenson/prototype/blob/master/src/dom/dom.js#L134"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/sstephenson/prototype/blob/master/src/dom/...</a>)<p>The idea was to explain what can and can not be deleted; that deleting variables is useless (and even not future-compatible), unless those are declared from within eval (very unlikely); that deleting host objects is dangerous.<p>Everything else — i.e. deleting user-defined object properties — can and should be done in the right context ;)",1263269937

Is there a comprehensive website or book that you can recommend?</i><p>The freelance kit from www.sitepoint.com is where I learned a lot about techniques for freelancing.  That's where I picked up the technique for deposits and milestones.  In fact, one of the best pieces of advice I got from there was never to be the lowest bidder.  There was a project we were bidding on, and the client ended up going with us even though we were the highest bid ($8000).  He showed us the other bids, and they came in at ($1600, $2800, and $4500).  He liked our proposal for a few reasons:  One, the other 3 bids were just Word documents or PDFs attached to email.  Ours was printed in color, bound, and sent FedEx overnight.  Another, we had detailed writeups of 3 previous projects with testimonials and phone numbers of the clients (used with permission).  Lastly, we had suggestions for additional features to add, with a cost/benefits analysis on each, along with suggestions of features that could be cut to reduce the timeline or cost.  All of these were suggestions from sitepoint's ebook.",1313517595

Microsoft spent 10 years trying to graft a touch-layer on top of a traditional operating system.<p>The iPad's non-obvious innovation was essentially to roll back PC innovations: they massively pared down the operating system, stripped out the legacy overhead and focused applications on small, tightly controlled and limited, optimized binaries, so they could scale back the hardware to the point where the battery <i>could</i> last more than 20 minutes.<p>Truly, innovations in hardware allowed them to put more horsepower with a longer running time in the case than MS could have ever achieved in the 90s.  But as of 2008, Microsoft was still following the ""full PC+touch"" strategy.  (For that matter they seem intent on continuing to flog that horse even today.)<p>And let's not forget that what looks obvious now, looked like a <i>failure</i> to most industry observers in 2009.

Good for Stanford; thank you, thank you, thank you Dean Terman!<p>Still, nearly all the world's top research universities are in the US, and the main reason is that right after WWII Ike and others concluded that research in math, physical science, and engineering were just crucial for US national security.  Congress has gone along.  Any significant claim that the US is falling behind in research will open Congress's funding for the usual suspects NSF, NIH, DoE, DARPA, etc.<p>Net, no way, not a chance, will Congress permit US research universities to fall behind:  From Congress all it takes is money, that is easy for Congress to vote, and actually in the big picture it doesn't take very much money.<p>Also, all things considered, the money is relatively well spent.  Evidence:  Getting those grants is DARNED competitive.  Want to get promoted at a top US research university?  Get a grant!<p>And there is a secret -- hush, hush!  About 60% of the grant money, for math, physical science, and engineering, goes to 'overhead' which ends up good for the English, modern dance, French literature, and art history departments!

2892045,comment,2890828,2891913,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Is Boyd still talking about convexity?<p>Convexity is an important concept, and the world is just awash in rock solid treatments.<p>So, for some positive integer n, consider n-dimensional Euclidean space.  Suppose C is a closed, convex subset and point x in the space is not in C.  Then there exists a closed half space that covers C and omits x.  The boundary of this closed half space can share a point with the boundary of the closed half space so that the plane of the half space is 'supporting' for C.  So, this is a 'separation' result.  Yes, it generalizes past finite dimensional Euclidean spaces!  Yes, it's a darned useful theorem!  E.g., can ask for the point in C closest to x -- the point has to exist since C is closed.  Then the plane through this point and perpendicular to the line to x is supporting for C.  So, can get a nice projection result and use it for optimization and best approximation.<p>Okay, my point:  This result is one of the most important about convexity but is standard in 'analysis'.  I first saw the result in the 'advanced calculus' book, Fleming, 'Functions of Several Variables'.<p>Bigger point:  Convexity pops up frequently in analysis.  E.g., there is Jensen's inequality.  With it can easily knock off a nice list of otherwise difficult to prove inequalities.  E.g., in the L^p spaces, we can use Jensen's inequality to get Holder's and Minkowski's inequalities.<p>When we start with optimization, we should start with convex sets and also convex functions.  E.g., there is a nice list of theorems of the alternative that are separation results for cones and polyhedra that can be used to establish some otherwise tricky results about duality in linear programming and are also key to the Kuhn-Tucker conditions in non-linear programming.  Of course, the feasible region in linear programming is a convex set.<p>In non-linear programming maximization, there is a non-linear dual that is to minimize a convex function, and that can be the core of the powerful technique of Lagrangian relaxation.<p>When we have a norm on a vector space, the locus of all points distance 1 from the origin is convex.<p>In facility location we can be minimizing a convex function and doing so by constructing a sequence of planes supporting the hypergraph of the convex function.<p>Alas, I never heard a lecture from Boyd!<p>There are plenty of rock solid, highly polished books where the role of complexity is made clear!",1313515389

It looked ridiculous, except for being a clever/good use for Microsoft OneNote at the time. There's no way those tablets can be compared to today's tablets, which are a fraction of cost, weight or thickness.<p>I'll also say that while battery life did make a difference, the actual way you interact with the OS was one of the mian reasons for the tablet tipping point. The clunky mouse pointer (controlled via pen) of yesteryear pales in comparison to what we use today.

2891977,comment,2891654,2891654,4,0,thequux,,,"Those size constraints are based on the concept of storing every password and its hash in the table. However, that gives a reverse lookup table, not a rainbow table. The key to a rainbow table is that you look at an initial password, hash it, use the hash to generate a new password, then repeat a few thousand times. Then you store only the initial password and the ending hash. To use the table, you do the same thing, but check each of the intermediate hashes against the rainbow table; if you find it, you start at the initial value and follow the chain until you get the password.<p>So, of the OP's points:\n1) Storage space: cut by a factor of several thousand. Assuming that you're OK with chains of 50K passwords, that's only about 1T total for something that will (probably) cover most of the password space.\n2) Hash algorithms: If you're using a single SHA256 to hash passwords, you're doing it wrong. SHA256 was designed to be fast. Real password hash algorithms are much, much slower. \n3) Salts: As AppSec says, most sites screw up salts.<p>So, while rainbow tables aren't that useful against a properly secure system, they still have their uses.",1313514689

2891939,comment,2891774,2891862,14,0,scelerat,,,"> cultural belief that a college degree will guarantee a living wage<p>I have more than a few friends and acquaintances who are deep in debt from school loans, many of them with degrees from excellent schools but with low market value (compared to e.g. engineering, science, medicine, law). I'd be in the same boat (a lit degree) if it weren't for an obsessive hobby that happened to be lucrative (programming, design).<p>So I think you're exactly right. Many people are given false expectations about what opportunities a degree confers. Much of what you're paying for is a good brand attached to your name and access to a social network. That's much more of a gamble than med school, where although you're guaranteed to come out with a lot of debt, you're also fairly certain you'll be able to pay it off in ten years or less while making a very comfortable living.<p>I would love to see more money and effort spent on secondary education, vocational education, and community colleges. I would pay more taxes if that's where they were going. If the collective mindset could be shifted from ""I need to go to college"" to ""I need to get an education, learn how to be creative and work constructively with other people,"" we'd have fewer people in debt and more functional institutions.<p>/hand-waving",1313514272

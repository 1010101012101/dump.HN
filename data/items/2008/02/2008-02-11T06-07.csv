113260,comment,113122,113122,0,0,dood,,,"Very interesting, the most promising implementation of the micropayments concept I've seen yet. I love the ruthless simplicity of their approach, just looking at the url-entry box conjured up a half-dozen sites I had semi-subconsciously intended to tip as soon as the right solution comes along.<p>Though I hope they find a way around the possible problem of people spamming tips or just frivolously IOUing. Ideally once the thing gets some momentum, people will have a small pool of cash in their account so that the proportion of IOUs goes down, and the benefit of using the site become clear. But they'll have to get to that point quickly enough sustain interest.",1202710608

We either left them where they were or gave them options that many of them prefer, which is another word for ""richer"".<p>We haven't freed them from whatever despot got to them first, but they don't seem to value that all that much.  It's hard to see how their choice or situation is our fault.",1202709808

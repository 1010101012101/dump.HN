8959134,comment,8955310,8957300,0,0,leggetter,,,"This is definitely correct. The article focuses more on data synchronisation where as a lot of services (some of which jkarneges has highlighted) don&#x27;t offer data storage and focus on letting you define your own feeds/channels/topics/subjects and exposing data updates/changes via messages or events. These services are highly complementary to RethinkDB as it&#x27;s very easy to see how a channel subscription can map to a changefeeds.<p>So services Firebase, PubNub Data Sync, Realtime.co cloud storage, the Google Drive Realtime API and Simperium (see: <a href=""http://www.leggetter.co.uk/real-time-web-technologies-guide/#_data-synchronisation-persistence-full-stack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leggetter.co.uk/real-time-web-technologies-guide/...</a>) are much more in-context to the article.",1422442788

One company I have worked for manufactured a bunch of turbine masts.

8959131,comment,8957692,8959023,0,0,sklogic,,,"If you really want to understand how things work from the very bottom, you can build a toy computer running on FPGA, there are some very cheap boards available now.<p>To make things even more interesting, you can write your own HDL compiler (into netlist, of course, anything lower level is, unfortunately, too proprietary).<p>From this point you can build up your abstractions. The shortest route to the high level you&#x27;re already comfortable with is to implement Forth first, since it&#x27;s very easy to build a simple stack-oriented machine on FPGA, see ( <a href=""http://www.excamera.com/sphinx/fpga-j1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.excamera.com/sphinx/fpga-j1.html</a> ). Running your own Forth on top of such a CPU is easier than on something like x86.<p>Next step is to implement a Scheme compiler and runtime in Forth. Garbage collection can be somewhat tricky, but if you go for something trivial, like stop-and-copy, it won&#x27;t take long to implement, especially if you have some assistance from your hardware.<p>Three totally manageable steps from the very bottom of the abstraction ladder - and you&#x27;ve got Scheme, an extensible, powerful meta-language, from which you can grow anywhere.<p>I recently wrote this bit on bootstrapping a Lisp-like language using the most trivial interpreter possible: <a href=""https://combinatorylogic.wordpress.com/2015/01/14/bootstrapping-a-compiler/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://combinatorylogic.wordpress.com/2015/01/14/bootstrapp...</a> - you can find this approach useful, I did a similar thing on top of Forth and it was very easy, much easier than trying to implement a &quot;proper&quot; interpreter.<p>And once you know how to build the whole thing from the bare silicon, there won&#x27;t be any place for &quot;magic&quot; in your understanding.",1422442726

I found them funny, while most people would&#x27;ve accused him of racism.<p>Anyway, back to the topic:<p>Confusion is not a part of it. I&#x27;m more irritated by sophism and syllogism behind/(to justify) the actions and the hypocrisy behind it all, than by the actions themselves.<p>In other words, I understand that someone acts a certain way, even if nasty. As long as they don&#x27;t try to justify it, once they try...<p>What do I mean? I&#x27;ll give three examples:<p>1- Censorship: Censorship assumes that some piece of information shouldn&#x27;t be available to a certain demographic because (in most cases) the censor thinks it would &quot;corrupt&quot; the people he&#x27;s trying to &quot;protect&quot;. So he insulates them.<p>If that were true (that a piece of information can do that), then the Censor would be the most corrupt person, since he&#x27;s exposed to all the pieces that cause someone to become corrupt.<p>- &quot;But he&#x27;s a censor, it&#x27;s his job and he&#x27;s not being corrupted&quot;.<p>- &quot;So someone <i>can</i> be exposed to these pieces of information and not be corrupted!&quot;.<p>- &quot;No, just him. The people can&#x27;t look at it, it&#x27;s dangerous&quot;.<p>- &quot;But the censor comes from the people.&quot;<p>- &quot;Yeah, but it&#x27;s different.&quot;<p>2 - Kings and members of the Clergy in Europe back in the day. &quot;Mandatad by God&quot; to rule and defend Christian religion. Kill and torture people for fornication and adultery. Engage in orgies and anchored the word &quot;incest&quot; with &quot;royalty&quot; in the collective mind.<p>3 - Islamist terrorists who, again, reproach to people &quot;not being religious&quot; and then do the very contrary of what they &quot;stand for&quot; -killing, raping, having sex with each other (&quot;but.. but.. You kill people who&#x27;re gay!&quot; - &quot;No.. It&#x27;s different&quot;), being ignorant (knowing that the first verse that came in Quran was this: &quot;Read&quot;).<p>Where does all this lead us?<p>>So, the law assumes that critisizing and making fun of the idea is something different than making fun or attacking the person believing it.<p>Well, that&#x27;s the official rhetoric to make it look as if freedom of speech is a reality. The making fun and the attacking isn&#x27;t equally distributed for reasons people prefer to avoid because it makes them uncomfortable.<p>The <i>law</i> states that it&#x27;s okay to make fun of everyone, but the law is just a text on paper.. What about the application of the law in real life?<p>The <i>law</i> also states that people are accountable, etc. What if you have a problem with a really high-ranking official, or someone powerful? Do you believe it&#x27;d be treated as &quot;just the same as if you had a problem with your plumber&quot;. The law says yes. Reality says no.<p>You&#x27;re talking about the law, I&#x27;m talking about the way a law is applied in real life.<p>Look at stories about Government surveillance. What about the CEO of a Telco company who didn&#x27;t want to give his customers&#x27; data to the Government? Prison for 4 years, if I recall correctly. Look at journalists busting these stories.. Held up in airports, harrassed, etc..<p>This isn&#x27;t happening in a &quot;third world&quot; country. This is happening in countries that criticize other countries as not having free speech, while tormenting their their own citizens for exerting that right.<p>In other words, they make a distinction between &quot;other backward totalitarian&quot; countries who say &quot;This is what you can&#x27;t say&quot;, and themselves who say &quot;You can say anything you want * (but we&#x27;ll smak your teeth if you say the wrong thing)&quot;.<p>>The same can not be told about racist or antisemitic statements (which both are regularely condemned)<p>Why? They&#x27;re so much fun. The thing my Texan friend said was a joke: &quot;You know, Muslims invented the condom from animal intestines.. But the English improved it by removing the intestines from the animal before using them&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but I found it hilarious. And I was raised Muslim. The funny thing is that other people were shocked.<p>I&#x27;m probably the guy who&#x27;ll go to hell and suffer Eternal Damnation by any religion&#x27;s standards, so I told the joke to my observant friends, and they all busted laughing.<p>I found that we live in an era where everyone is so susceptible and hush hush. Nobody can speak freely in these illusory freedom of expression times.<p>>Any cartoonist can make fun of the jewish religion, and jews themselves do so regularely.<p>Yeah, well everyone has something that make them tick. For Muslims, they pretty much don&#x27;t care about anything(there are even jokes about misinterpreting religious concepts, usually salacious jokes or jokes to make fun of hypocrit religious people, etc), unless it&#x27;s a Prophet.<p>And here&#x27;s the thing: People think that Muslims don&#x27;t like people making fun of <i>their</i> Prophet, which is wrong.. They don&#x27;t like people making fun of / or depicting <i>any</i> Prophet in a bad light, (One of the pillars is that you can&#x27;t be &quot;religious/observant/faithful&quot; in Islam if you don&#x27;t believe in <i>all</i> of them. The other pillars are that you have to believe in the other Books, the Angels, God, Judgement Day, and Fate (good or bad)).<p>>It is a fine line, but it has historical reasons and it worked fairly well for the last century.<p>As in most things, it depends who you ask. Some might wonder a country who murdered millions in the last century (not even needing a &quot;war&quot;) might care about freedom of speech. For those who might see gratuitous jabs on things of the past, suffice to say that France not only didn&#x27;t want to appologize for what it did, it recently had a bill proposal for the &quot;Positive effects of Colonialism&quot;. Because almost exterminating a people, and throwing a country that had thousands of baths before Christ, home to Fibonacci who exported the right numerals to Europe to replace Roman numerals, go back a few thousand years back is cool.<p>As I said, I&#x27;m more irritated by the bullshit to get away with something, than the actual thing.<p>I understand &quot;Realism&quot; in the Machiavellian/International Relations sense, but don&#x27;t stand a rhetoric weak enough that a layman such as myself can pick it up, from people supposed to be fine diplomats. It&#x27;s sort of insulting.. But again, you&#x27;re free to express your mind.",1422441711

Being able to let the &quot;meat&quot; of a method be separated from all the error-checking, post, pre conditions etc would really make things cleaner.<p>Current implementation feels like it requires too much setup with separate classes, duplicate method signatures in several places etc etc. It would be really cool to have something like<p><pre><code>  public int SomeMethod(int a, int b)\n\n  pre \n  { \n    Requires (a > 5);\n    Requires (b >= 0, new Exception(&quot;something something&quot;));\n  }\n\n  {\n     // DoStuffHere\n  }\n\n  post\n  {\n    Ensures (result > 0, new Exception(&quot;needs to be above 0&quot;));\n  }\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;d even want to be able to separate it into separate files using partial classes (or something) so you could the condition stuff separate , with or without duplicating signature\ndepending if you wanted to target specific overloads<p>Full signature would simply be without the body:<p><pre><code>  public int SomeMethod(int a, int b)\n\n  pre\n  {\n    Requires (a > 5);\n    Requires (b >= 0 ,new Exception(&quot;something something&quot;));\n  }\n\n  post\n  {\n    Ensures (result > 0);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nWithout signature is trickier, but would be cool since you could use same conditions for several overloads, and just target the variables that are included in each:<p><pre><code>  Conditions.SomeMethod\n  {\n    pre\n    {\n      Requires (a > 5);\n      Requires (b >= 0, new Exception(&quot;something something&quot;));\n    }\n\n   post\n   {\n     Ensures (result > 0);\n   }\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\nheck, why not even throw in  &quot;test blocks&quot; and Visual studio could run light-weight kind of unit test as you programmed and mark the whole method as functioning or not. Imagine having a sort method and throw in something like:<p><pre><code>  public IEnumerable<int> Sort (IEnumerable<int> list, Order order)\n  test\n  {\n     (list = {3,5,6,2}, order = Order.Ascending) => result == {2,3,5,6};\n     (list = {3,5,6,2}, order = Order.Descending) => result == {6,5,3,2}\n  }\n</code></pre>\nVS could highlight the failed test(s) directly in the editor as you coded<p>The specifics and syntaxes of these things requires some thought but I love the basic premise, am I rambling?<p>edit: I saw that something in this direction if not as extensive was actually discussed",1422441378

Also, people learn, so several failed projects can actually lead eventually to a success and delivery, if the person is able and willing.",1422440550

Even if Iter is successful it will take -guessing here- decades to bring it to production and the better part of half a century to roll it out in any significant way.<p>I think the next technological leap will be in manipulating huge amounts of energy, maybe we can warp space and go to the starts. So something like fusion power is probably necessary for that.<p>In the mean time, I think we can keep the lights on.<p>&quot;The promise of fusion, if scientists can get it to work, is huge – unlimited power without any carbon emissions and very little radioactive waste.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m interested in how much CO2 is emitted to produce 400,000 tonnes of steel and concrete. I wonder what the life time emissions are for a fusion power plant, given that nothing lasts forever it will have to be maintained and have major rebuilds. This is an experimental design, so it will probably never pay back construction related CO2 emissions, so we should look at the numbers for a theoretical production unit, and how those numbers compare to other power generation technologies.",1422440295

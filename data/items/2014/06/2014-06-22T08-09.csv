By social network, we mean any places on the social sphere where people are genuinely raising enquires.  Example: nowadays, a lot of Facebook groups for entrepreneurs and freelancers have grown so much. On these groups a lot of people post their queries and look for references. Example, someone might post that they need an Android Application done, a logo, content writer or even require an event agency. Being a service provider myself, I have received genuine leads from these groups. We are looking at smartly data mining these enquiries and showing these leads to the relevant business owners.<p>Our target audience would be SMEs and freelancers. They will be able to add the keywords associated with their business and leads associated with them will automatically appear on their Leadify dashboard. Then the business can contact them via our dashboard and try to close the deal.<p>We really want some support from the community in getting feedback. \nHow can we improve it further? \nWhat relevant data would a business owner want regarding the lead? \nHow can we improve the lead generating experience of any business owner? \nWhat problems does one face in normally getting leads? \nHow much would a business owner be willing to pay if the product gives genuine value and helps convert 1-2 leads per month?<p>Here is the prototype version of the product - http://leadify.in<p>Looking forward to your valuable comments :)<p>Thank you.<p>Sumeet Chawla",1403427016

7927265,comment,7925162,7925162,2,0,chacham15,,,"I take issue with the method posed in the article when they discuss the method using a gaussian distribution to sometimes guess a number between the higher and the lower. The reason I take issue is because the ability to generate a useful distribution requires knowledge of what numbers I pick. A gaussian distribution is generated via a mean and standard deviation. To defeat this system, all a knowledgeable person would need to do is randomly select a mean and a small standard deviation and choose his two numbers from there. Then the probability that the guesser will choose his number R to be within the mean and standard deviation of the one you picked will be essentially zero.<p>To illustrate in a slightly simpler way, in order to choose your two numbers choose a random integer and the same random integer + 2 (2 to at least give the guy a chance). I could choose 1 billion and 1 billion + 2, or one and three. The chance that you would choose R to be 1 billion +1 or two, respectively, is nearly zero.<p>In order to get above 50% you need some sort of extra knowledge. In this case that knowledge comes from the gaussian distribution. Knowledge often affects probabilities even though they dont seem like they should.

Also, you are extrapolating global climate from the local climate at a single location. Local change does not necessarily correlate with global changes. In this case the data we have indicates that the &#x27;Mid-Holocene Warm Period&#x27; was only warmer in the Northern Hemisphere, and only during summer.<p>>What that reinforces in me is that regardless of cause, climate change happens<p>You are missing an important factor which is the <i>rate</i> of change. Faster changes have much greater potential to disrupt economies and ecosystems. To put that into some perspective: <a href=""http://tamino.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/shakun_marcott_hadcrut4_a1b_eng.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tamino.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/shakun_marcott_had...</a><p>>conversely even when human carbon footprint on the planet was nearly zero, the planet was warmer than it is today. And that suggests to me that human impact is irrelevant to the challenge of surviving in a changing climate.<p>Come on now, I don&#x27;t believe you are really this ignorant. The problem with climate change isn&#x27;t conditions <i>today</i>, which are not that much different to the past and don&#x27;t yet pose many significant challenges to human activity. The problem is that continued emissions is going to result in global temperature probably at least several degrees warmer within 100 years (which means much bigger changes than that in some places), and that kind of change over such a short period of time will pose a lot of serious problems to humans (and the biosphere in general).",1403426347

Newspapers are dying, but their original need - to publish what was originally hidden, to shine a light on government, still exists and seems to be well served by the Wikileaks core of true anonymity - and so faced with destruction I would expect some newspapers to morph into Wikileaks with a two hundred year track record.<p>I am seeing this in WaPo and Guardian and maybe al-jazera",1403424296

You&#x27;ve now conceded that the barista scenario is plausible and left open several others I mentioned.<p>But let&#x27;s examine this one, just bars. The basis of your criticism is that some bars are located in residential buildings. First off this still leaves quite a number of bars that aren&#x27;t. But even for those that are, the time of day and direction of travel is a pretty fair indicator of people who are bar patrons vs. residents. I.e. trips departing the building after 1am and arriving at a residential location are probably a lot more likely to be bar patrons than residents.<p>And don&#x27;t forget that this public data set is also potentially privacy-violating when combined with other data about the destination, such as information that other residents of that location may know. So even if the general public couldn&#x27;t determine much from a trip from a gay bar to a home residence one night, a live-in parent could.",1403424226

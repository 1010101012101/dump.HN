1571,comment,1548,1552,0,0,veritas,,,"The release date is set to mid 2007 from what I can gather.  June/July is probably when I'd expect it to hit the public.  I don't really develop with Flex since I stick to web based apps.  I also have few misgivings about installing Apollo and letting it mess around with my filesystem.  They better have a robust security layer or else developers will shy away from it.",1172692096

To me, this sounds like a case of too much technology and too little common sense....""<p>Seriously though, it seems they would have used a framework that wouldn't allow an error like that, especially if it was in just a few lines of code, to propagate to all of the systems.  They definitely weren't using erlang (couldn't resist).",1172692023

1561,comment,1551,1557,0,0,jwecker,,,"Well, did you notice most of the top ten list had things like-  Ranked No. 50 in the ""Entrepreneurial Activity"" indicator.  Obviously they weighed that indicator very lightly or else ignored it altogether.  As for me, I think that in a free (enough) market the entrepreneurial activity indicator would be the most accurate of all.  I think this article was to help state and civic governments feel good about themselves.  Even the indicators like Venture Funding available and IT force don't mean much in the context of startups, in my opinion.  Not if the IT force are all government workers (like in Virginia) or the VC firm has a small portfolio of enormous brick-and-mortar businesses (dunno if that's true in one of those).<p>Possibly insightful initial data.  Bad algorithm IMO for the conclusion.",1172690862

""But if you're an entrepreneur trying to do something new, something that's based on new kinds of products or services, and you want to be globally linked and need highly skilled workers and IT infrastructure, this is a much more accurate tool for that,"" says Atkinson.""<p>---<p>So I'm interested to see exactly what parameters went into determining the best places for ""an entrepreneur trying to do something new.""",1172689854
1556,comment,1548,1548,0,0,danielha,,,"Apollo has always been a curiosity for me. The things I'm seeing looks very cool but I also wonder about the psychological acceptability (ease of integration). The runtime is a small download, but it's still another runtime outside of the browser. <p>The potential of developing Flex applications, among others, in this type of environment is attractive, and I truly want to be convinced. But I need to see more before that happens.",1172689627

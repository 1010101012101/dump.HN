Self-publishing meant paying for the manufacture of physical books. There was no distribution. Normally the books sat on a pallet in the author&#x27;s garage. Readers consisted of the author&#x27;s family and friends.<p>Small press publishing is a business, just done at a smaller scale than the majors.<p>Indie publishing uses digital media and distribution networks to put texts into the hands of readers.

Conversations about it tend to be, uh, unproductive.<p>You know, you could address the topic, not the participants. To fail at this is the very definition of counterproductive.<p>> Psychology has a lousy history of weak science.<p>Yep. People have asked me why I focus on psychology, since all fields have embarrassing episodes in which the principles of science are ignored. The answer is that, although psychologists have clinics, they don&#x27;t have enough science to justify their existence.<p>Sociologists are equally unscientific, but they don&#x27;t have clinics.<p>Doctors also have clinics, but they&#x27;re much more scientific.<p>This makes psychology a conspicuous gap in the system meant to protect the public from charlatans. But the gap is closing -- the director of the NIMH, the highest-ranking psychiatrist in the country, recently decided to pull the plug on the DSM and, by implication, psychiatry and psychology.<p><a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-dia...</a><p>Quote: &quot;While DSM has been described as a Bible for the field, it is, at best, a dictionary, creating a set of labels and defining each.

6481380,comment,6480155,6480155,1,0,Theodores,,,"I think this article is about much more than nature vs. nurture and it doesn&#x27;t deserve to be trolled that way.<p>We can learn a lot about ourselves, language and how we learn from understanding a bit about those born deaf. It really is a big deal and Oliver Sacks gets to the heart of the matter in his excellent book &#x27;Seeing Voices: A Journey into the World of the Deaf&#x27;:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0330523643/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0330523643/</a><p>A highly recommended read for anyone on HN...<p>The article also mentions nannies. A problem they have that the parents aren&#x27;t ever made aware of is what happens when the child uses big meaningful words for the first time. The nanny wants the parents to be the first to hear these words rather than merely report back to the parents that said big meaningful words have been said. So praise cannot always be given by a nanny when praise is deserved.<p>Although the article says that quality conversation is important, the metric seems to be quantity of words. After a certain developmental stage I am not sure how helpful quantity actually is. There are plenty of adults that I have met over the years that can babble on and babble on. If you are actually trying to concentrate on something then having a constant babbler around is just so not what you need. I consider myself to be a bit of a rambler but not a constant babbler. However, I cannot engage with a toddler in the way a constant babbler can. I go quiet on the two year old whereas the babbler does not.<p>Further down the line I think that the dinner table offers an amazing opportunity for children to improve their vocabulary, engage in conversation, learn when to listen and when to talk. This is particularly the case when parents have adult guests and allow young children to be on the same table eating the same food. Here the nurture comes from extended family and friends. I feel slightly sorry for friends that did not get this during their formative years, even if they did have more time in restaurants (which are posh and grown up).",1380704005

I&#x27;ll do my best at a level-zero explanation of &quot;intelligence&quot; in the literature:<p>Let&#x27;s start by modestly noting that I routinely got the top score on Latin tests in high school (this was worth a small box of chocolates!).  Someone applying the concept of &quot;intelligence&quot; might predict that I would also do well in math class. The traditional explanation for this given by Latin teachers is that learning Latin trains the mind to think logically, and getting high scores on Latin tests means that the training has taken.  The intelligence-based explanation is that Latin and math are two of many tasks subject to the influence of <i>g</i>, the &quot;general factor&quot;.<p>Moving to a more general level, the observation is that for many, many tests that appear to involve &quot;mental abilities&quot; to a greater or lesser degree, a person&#x27;s score on any one of them is predictive of the same person&#x27;s score on all the others.  It&#x27;s rare to find someone who is good at one and bad at another; instead, people tend to be uniformly good or uniformly bad (known in the literature as the phenomenon of the &quot;positive manifold&quot;).  This suggests that there&#x27;s one quality driving all the results, which we can call &quot;intelligence&quot;, since that&#x27;s the label commonly applied to people who tend to do well on those types of tests.<p>Corrections are of course welcome.",1380703039

The article says that talking with, and reading to, your kids improves their verbal skills and makes them able to better process information. Who could argue with that? My mom would read to me all the time when I was younger. She would read to me books she liked, classic scifi and such. I enjoyed them very much, even though they weren&#x27;t written for kids. She would talk about the stories with me and explain some things I did not get. I think that helped quite a bit with my language skills. However, that&#x27;s in noway negates the fact that some kids are simply smarter genetically then others. Paying attention to your kid and talking with them would greatly increase their abilities, but all kids aren&#x27;t borne equal, and I don&#x27;t think the article makes that argument, unlike the title. It should be changed to &quot;Talking to kids greatly increases their cognitive abilities.&quot;<p>I think having kids be exposed to several other languages as soon as they are borne, and reading to them books you personally like and find interesting helps them immensely (obviously filter out explicit content, old classics are usually good). It&#x27;s also important not to dumb things down for kids. Basically Teletubbies = bad, family friendly comedy in a foreign language = good.<p>In a side note I also find it infuriating how economists always make an argument that women should go back into the workforce after having kids, because its good for the family and for the economy. But what about the kid. I don&#x27;t want to single out women, but I think either the mother or the father should take at least 5 years off, after the birth of their child, to raise their child, instead of hiring a nanny. I understand that it&#x27;s not fair to always ask the women to do it, but some one in the family should.

Pretty much everything just works, and a lot of that I believe is squarely because they are perfectly happy to break convention if that is what it takes for them to get where they want to be.<p>>  and they wont because now there is two backends to support for the toolkits<p>Both Qt and GTK have far more than just two backends already, yet they keep working. Two more is hardly going to be vastly more difficult to get right.<p>E.g. Gtk has Windows and OS X versions, as well as a HTML5 backend, and a DirectFB backend. And presumably the X backend will stay around too.<p>>  but what will you say in the error message &quot;Something stopped working, sorry?&quot;.<p>What does it say today if the X server fails?<p>> I never wanted to touch pulseaudio with a ten-foot pole, it is kept away from my systems in every form. Yet Ive seen apps complain about pulseaudio and have it in their settings by default, then not working and telling me to fix my pulseaudio installation.<p>So either don&#x27;t use those apps, fix them, or install Pulse Audio anyway. It&#x27;s not app developers obligation to make things keep working on every bizarre configuration around.<p>If you want a conservative distribution, perhaps you will be happier with Debian.<p>> There will be apps developed by Ubuntu for Mir that will just cause problems when others try to run them on Wayland.<p>If people write their apps to run straight on Mir, sure. Just as if people write their code to target any library that isn&#x27;t universally available.<p>But just like exceedingly few people target X directly without a toolkit or wrapper, I think it&#x27;ll be exceedingly unlikely that lots of people will clamour to write code targeting Mir directly. Much less likely than depending on pulse-audio functionality, for example.",1380701735

But we can say with complete certainty that it&#x27;s not the case that &quot;one generation didn&#x27;t have our level of intelligence and the next did&quot; because generations don&#x27;t happen at any particular time.  Imagine your ancestor through the paternal line 30 generations back from you (that is, your father&#x27;s father&#x27;s father&#x27;s... father).  If you call him generation 1, then you&#x27;re generation 31.  But other people born in the same year as you, also descended from him, will not all be generation 31.  And if you married one of them who was, for the sake of argument, only 28 generations removed from him, your children would be, in this labeling scheme, simultaneously generation 32 and generation 29.<p>The reason I say your question is confused is that the model where there was a &quot;single change&quot;, and all humans today descend from it, requires several generations to take hold (as it gradually increases its population share), but you appear to posit only one.",1380701150

6481256,comment,6477505,6477505,8,0,kijin,,,"The author is a maintainer of eCryptFS. For those not familiar with it, eCryptFS is an encrypted filesystem used by several Linux distributions (including Ubuntu) to protect your home directory and/or the entire disk. It serves a similar purpose to TrueCrypt, BitLocker, FileVault, etc.<p>For the purpose of a full-disk encryption software, fingerprints are many times weaker than a good password. The purpose of such software is to prevent a thief, the cops, the NSA, or anyone else who takes possession of your computer, from viewing the contents of your hard drive. A fingerprint won&#x27;t protect you from the cops, since your prints are already all over the place and they can probably force you to provide a fresh copy anyway. In that case, fingerprint logins would only give the user an illusion of security. So it&#x27;s understandable that the author doesn&#x27;t want to enable fingerprint logins to his software.<p>For the purpose unlocking a phone, on the other hand, a fingerprint is probably good enough. The contents of the phone usually aren&#x27;t encrypted, so a determined attacker will just turn the phone off, pull out the SD card and/or the internal Flash memory, and read everything off of it. Or if you&#x27;re NSA, forget the phone and get the data straight from Apple. TouchID is not for NSA-proofing your phone, it&#x27;s for deterring common thieves and pranksters.<p>tl;dr: I agree with the author that fingerprints are not a good fit for full-disk encryption software. But I don&#x27;t agree that fingerprints are completely useless. It all depends on the type of attack you&#x27;re trying to defend against.",1380700813

He argues that people who are going to be great programmers will discover coding as their passion just by looking around. I disagree. Many in my generation learned to code when a teacher showed them LOGO. How is that fundamentally different from organizing study groups, or trying to make a website, book, or email list that will get people who are new to programming to discover the joy of programming?",1338055120

The IPD merely shows that given a situation in which neither party has any advantage over the other the best choice for maximizing outcomes is cooperation. In this sense the prisoner's dilemma ""begs the question"" or assumes the answer it then provides.

4027864,comment,4027387,4027763,8,0,cjy,,,"I used to feel that way.  But, after some contemplation, I realized how conceited that is.  People are so multidimensional and have such varying experiences that it is arrogant to think that there is nothing interesting about someone you have just met.  They may not be good at communicating and they may seem to be boring or shallow.  But, they almost certainly have knowledge and experiences that are foreign to you.  The trick is finding what they are.  If someone can't find anything interesting about another human being, it probably says more about their lack of wonder than about the target's ""interestingness"" (although sometimes communication is the problem too).  I really like watching Dirty Jobs with Mike Rowe to see him converse with the people he is working with.  If you were small talking with these people in the dentist office they might seem boring.

4027857,comment,4027461,4027461,1,0,adrianhoward,,,"First define what you mean by ""quality"" and ""design"" :-)<p>For many people outside the design/ux field ""design"" is something that happens <i>after</i> the product is defined and created. It's just about the visuals - ""making something pretty"". For people inside the design/ux field design it's as much about understanding the users, figuring out the problem, defining the product, figuring out the behaviour, etc. Not that the visual design aspect is unimportant - but it's only a part of what ""design"" is all about.<p>For many people outside the design/ux field a ""quality"" design is something that looks like something Apple would produce. For people inside the design/UX field a quality design is one that <i>works</i>. You don't design the advertisements for a MacDonald's burger the same way you design the adverts for the latest iPhone. Their aimed at different audiences with different goals.  One isn't ""good"" and the other ""bad"".<p>So - does quality design help business? It depends (the favourite designer answer :-)<p>If you have a rubbish product then getting in a visual designer at the last minute to make it pretty probably isn't going to help much. ""Putting lipstick on a pig"" is the phrase you'll often hear designers use about this sort of project.<p>If you have an okay product with a truly terrible visual design - you may find a purely visual revamp can help. I've seen a <i>purely visual</i> revamp of a terrible web app admin system cause users to praise all the wonderful new functionality - which was always there before they just couldn't find it :-)<p>On the other hand - unless the UI is awful - you may find that a purely visual revamp does relatively little beyond make the designer not want to vomit (in the same way that having a big-ball-of-mud codebase doesn't really effect the users experience either, just makes the developers feel ill).<p>You may find that a pure visual redesign can help you reposition your product so that it better attracts the right audience. I worked on a project once where we very deliberately moved to a ""less pretty"" visual look since the ""nice"" design was putting off the low-budget end of the market.<p>The real value from design, and folk in the design/UX profession, is when you get them in from the start. All that ""get out of the building"" stuff that Steve Blank goes on about, all the product/market fit stuff that Eric Reis emphasises. That's what good UX/design folk <i>do</i> - and the good ones are very, very good at it (and have a stack of tools and techniques to help).",1338054565

The thread about DuckDuckGo a few days back exemplifies this and there was a discussion of it just yesterday. Basically, people want to be heard and the best way to do it is to be a contrarian.<p>A few years back I joined HN and was so intimidated by all the smart people here that it took a long time before I started commenting. Now, if you're not paying attention it's easy to mistakenly assume that the smart people ""know better"" and will comment with their opinions on how they'd do XYZ better. A lot of the threads I saw back then had people giving contrarian opinions and getting lots of attention for it. So for the newbie it's most likely easy to assume that's how things are done around here and that's how you prove your intelligence/expertise. But the thing is, what often looks like a contrarian view is often a question or an alternative way to do XYZ that isn't really saying XYZ is bad or wrong at all.<p>So I think it's a case of monkey see monkey do mixed with a misunderstanding of popular comments, who their authors are, and missing context. Everyone wants to be the smartest person in the room. HN can be an intimidating place because of how seriously exceptional a lot of people around here are. Hell, I still feel like a moron half the time when I comment. Egos get in the way of accepting that instead of being the smartest you should learn from the smartest and seeing that you don't <i>have</i> to say anything at all. In fact, saying nothing is often the smartest thing to do. How does that saying go? Something like ""Shut up and let people assume you're stupid instead of opening your mouth and confirming it""?",1338054221

4027791,comment,4027461,4027461,1,0,alsomike,,,"I work in a highly competitive industry, and often get this question at networking events and conferences from people in my industry. I like to see them succeed, so I give them this advice: don't worry about your website! It's just an extra cost that doesn't contribution to your bottom line or add value for your customers. That goes not just for web, but any form of style or presentation. Here are my tips for cutting out the waste:<p>- Company logo - don't need one, just use your name<p>- Business cards - new hires can design their own using web-based tools provided by the printing company<p>- Product photography - business was conducted just fine before the invention of the camera, using words to describe products<p>- Web design - have an admin type up the information in Word, save it as HTML and upload it to your website. All on one page is fine.<p>- Sales brochures - a print-out of your website<p>- Language - we don't spend a lot of time on copy editing, spell checking, correct punctuation. UX consultants who want to sell you their services will try to show you research showing how these things effect conversion rates, like how Zappos improved their bottom line by spellchecking customer reviews. Don't fall for these tricks!<p>- Suits - our company culture discourages wearing suits, even for sales people who meet with prospects. Controversial? Yes, but it lets everyone know that we have laser focus on our delivering value and cutting out wasteful spending on superficial things. Sweat pants are extremely cost-effective, easy to maintain and functional.<p>- Personal grooming - another area to reduce costs is on expensive and time-consuming haircuts, showering, shaving, make-up, shining shoes, dentistry, etc. These are nice, but humans survived just fine for thousands of years without these superficial aesthetic concerns.<p>Remember, in business, nothing else matters but delivering value for your customer. Consultants who want to sell you their services will tell you differently, but customers really only care about your product or service and couldn't care less about your website colors, logo or how your salespeople look and smell. These are added costs for trivial things that don't contribute to your bottom line. I recommend this approach to all my current competitors and also to new people trying to enter my field.",1338053289

We have a laptop with a projector but no internet access where the meeting occurs, so it had to be able to live on a Windows machine without network access. Bottle allowed me to pull together something in about five hours that uses sqlite for local storage of all of the participants names and whether they are present/absent and any notes. Previously, I was doing this on an inherited excel spreadsheet and it was very difficult for anyone else to read their name or any information. Now, it's a very simple HTML page with very large font that can be read from the back of the room.<p>So, thank you bottle! I was able to develop on Linux and fairly painlessly deploy it to the Windows laptop, and it worked the first time. (That was scary... Rarely happens to me.)",1338052054

4027733,comment,4027201,4027502,4,0,twstws,,,"I think the default should be the method that displays the most information. Why hide information if you don't have to? In the case of one dimensional data, a dotplot shows the reader everything. Using a boxplot reduces information content, mean-plus-errorbars reduces this further. The mean plus errorbars imposes a probability distribution, which may be wrong, it doesn't reveal a hidden truth.<p>The same holds in two dimensions. Show me all the data, and include a regression line or a spline to highlight a trend. Only start hiding information when the scatterplot becomes misleading. That is, when overplotting prevents  me from accurately assessing the actual distribution of the points.<p>Jumping immediately to a density plot also restricts me to your interpretation. The original data is lost. With a scatterplot, the raw data can be recovered from the plot, so i can do my own analysis should i be interested. This is common in meta-analyses that extract data from multiple published papers. If those original papers had used density plots instead of scatterplots, reanalysis will require direct access to the underlying data. Once the original author dies, or loses the data, all further use of the data is lost.",1338051939

(Although if they know exactly how many acquisitions they plan, they can just sell at the all-time high price now, keeping the money for the acquisitions, instead of selling somewhat lower so that they can use stock with confidence built into it later.  But, if they don't know this, and you would expect they wouldn't, then the latter strategy would have more merit).  So, I agree with you if you meant this is another limit to wanting to sell as high as possible in the IPO, decline or no decline thereafter.",1338051847

This is called a copy attack and it's the reason why the watermark is not very useful for identification by a crawler. A getty watermarked image could be a real getty image or any image someone inserted a getty watermark. In other words you could sort of DoS the getty crawler very easily.<p>Digimarc had an interesting research paper on their website about this topic but unfortunately it had been removed. In 2011 I wrote an email to Digimarc customer support asking if their newest watermarks are still vulnerable to a copy attack and the answer was: ""There are hundreds of applications and specific use cases\nfor digital watermarking as I'm sure you found in your research.

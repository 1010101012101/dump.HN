A gun will help me defend myself and family. 
A gun can be kept safe by adhering to certain known gun safety principles. Accidents happen but then a brick from a building's facade can smack you in the head in the morning.

I do think there is a strong argument for the fact that guns are part of American culture, or at least a large enough proportion of the American population to count in that respect. Hunting, recreation, these are perfectly legitimate and reasonable arguments to allow gun ownership.<p>The problem is that the 'gun lobby' doesn't stop there. They insist that guns make you safer, when the actual evidence couldn't be clearer that they don't. They perpetuate myths such as that an armed society is a polite society, when in fact access to firearms dramatically increases the risk that a confrontation will escalate to lethal violence.<p>American society is saturated with guns. Those weapons aren't going to go away any time soon. So the IMHO the rational response is to look at what is achievable. Educating gun owners as to the real risks, promoting gun safety, encouraging and legislating for safe practices around gun ownership, storage and use. These are all achievable goals.",1362992238

5355584,comment,5353828,5353828,5,0,neya,,,"I might get downvoted for this..but I'll risk it, because it is a message that needs to be passed. My experience on using Lift. A few months ago, I was evaluating various frameworks to start off with my new web app. I am already running a dozen RoR apps and gradually I'm moving away from RoR. I will explain as to why, later in my post.<p>I was evaluating between Play and Lift and I ended up choosing....Lift. Lift has an extremely high barrier to entry mainly because of the poor documentation. When I first started off with scala, I didn't even know what the hell was SBT, when I downloaded Lift, there were a lot of things that were confusing - I was expecting perfectly organized folders just like ruby on rails, but everything was almost hidden/scattered. However this was the only barrier to starting up with Lift. I also did read about the controversies about the framework, etc [1]. of Lift, but honestly, none of them actually mattered to the developer, that is me. Now that I've chosen Lift, I think I made the right choice. Now, WHY is Lift better?<p>1) It's a 3+ year old Framework that is extremely stead-fast and stable, production-ready.<p>2) Scalability - This is a subjective view, but many high profile companies switch to Scala from Ruby/PHP/etc. when they need to scale. And Lift is a really good framework that gets the job done. [2][3]<p>3) Contrary to popular belief, once you cross the barrier to entry, it becomes much much easier to develop Web apps with Lift. Remember those wordpress days? How scary it was in the beginning to write custom themes and plugins?? But once you started writing a few, it felt like a breeze, right? That's what I'm talking about - That's exactly how Lift is too! [4]<p>4) Security - Security is hard. Sure you can write your Web app without using a framework. But if you use RoR, you will realize how much work is being done on behalf of you to make your app secure (Authenticity token, CSRF protection ,etc.) Lift is no different and it is one of the most securest frameworks I've ever worked with.[5] This is a very good guide explaining why you need to choose Lift over anything else.[6]<p>5) RoR vs Scala - Now, Imagine this scenario - You are a sculptor (web developer). You have two materials to choose from to create a statue (your web app). One is ordinary clay (Ruby on Rails) and the other one is a Metal, preferably some alloy made of copper and bronze (Lift). It is extremely easy to model your Statue (your web app) in Clay. And once you're done modeling, you can add some chemicals, or even thin layers of metal on top of it, etc. to make it strong (Think Unicorn, Phusion, etc). But, no matter what you do, the core is still made of clay and if you throw it down, your clay model will shatter into pieces.<p>Now compare it with the Bronze alloy (Lift). It is extremely hard to make a statue with it, but once you make statue with it, it's going to be so hard and robust, it can handle pressure (load) well - Even if you drop it, it might deform slightly, but never break. But, the disadvantage is that it takes too long to model a statue with this metal. However, you should decide if the trade-off in time is worth the effort in the long run. Of course everyone wants a nice status that is robust!<p>In the real world, you will probably be ok with RoR, but when you need to scale, you will realize the potential benefits you are missing out soon[7] - For example, if RoR can handle X requests/sec, and Lift can handle 10x requests per second, and assuming X requests require an Amazon box, then you save 9 boxes with Lift. That is huge savings for your start up, isn't it? I always wonder why people try so hard to scale RoR. It's a great framework, but the wiser thing to do would be to use something more efficient when you need to , than holding onto something that is less efficient because you like it. Also RoR has its own confusing terminologies (personal opinion). For example:<p><pre><code>    render json: @post
    render :json => {:errors}
</code></pre>
Notice the colons before and after the word 'json'.<p>If you are interested in Scala, Coursera has a course on Learning Scala by Martin Odersky (The creator of Scala) and it is really good. Scala is not a purely functional programming language, which means if you are accustomed to programming in Ruby style, you can take it with you to Scala too.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.quora.com/Lift-web-framework/Why-did-Typesafe-select-Play-for-their-stack-instead-of-Lift/answer/David-Pollak"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Lift-web-framework/Why-did-Typesafe-sel...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://img.scoop.it/FP9bEzouSr7kRinQRAtGmDl72eJkfbmt4t8yenImKBVaiQDB_Rd1H6kmuBWtceBJ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://img.scoop.it/FP9bEzouSr7kRinQRAtGmDl72eJkfbmt4t8yenIm...</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://www.quora.com/Why-did-foursquare-choose-Lift"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Why-did-foursquare-choose-Lift</a><p>[4]<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2573608/what-type-of-webapp-is-the-sweet-spot-for-scalas-lift-framework"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2573608/what-type-of-weba...</a><p>[5]<a href=""http://seventhings.liftweb.net/security"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seventhings.liftweb.net/security</a><p>[6]<a href=""http://seventhings.liftweb.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seventhings.liftweb.net/</a><p>[7]<a href=""http://lift.la/lift-state-and-scaling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lift.la/lift-state-and-scaling</a>",1362992114

Then other movies copied it, and they too could be set to that same clock. Asking for originality is what we consumers should do but it is not what sends money to the bank if you are a producer. I would not know how we even could began fixing this.<p>2) video games do not present a wide variety of male types. Since when did you see a undecisive, meek, emotional erratic male protagonist? How often is he a gear of wars massive hulk made of 99% muscles, with so low base sounding voice that he likely has a serious sickness in the throat?  How often doesnt he act like an emotionalless robot, creating a flood of corpses and steals anything that's not nailed down?<p>3) while I am not a game developer, I doubt that having strong women would lower the numbers of sales to boys. I don't see anyone arguing this. I do however think that the industry is lazy, and is not going to change their products if they don't have to. Movie producers and game producers are in this aspect very similar, and focus on what ever sold the most yesterday.

I have been reading all about it when I go to the bookstore in the book Turing's Cathedral[1].<p>David Hilbert wanted to redo mathematics from square one, basing everything on set theory, axioms, and rigorous proofs.  In 1900, Hilbert gave his famous address where he stated the Hilbert Problems.  One of these was to prove that mathematics is ""complete"" in the sense that every possible statement is either provable or disprovable from the axioms.<p>In an effort to solve this problem, Alan Turing wrote his famous paper ""On Computable Numbers"" where he conceived for the first time his ""Turing Machines"".  Although his approach didn't work to solve the Hilbert problem, it greatly inspired Von Nueman who at the time was pretty much working on pure mathematics.<p>Godel came along and proved that mathematics is not ""complete"", because there are some statements about natural numbers which cannot be proved or disproved from the axioms, but rather are undecidable.<p>Von Nueman was so upset by Godel's result that he decided he no longer wanted to work in pure mathematics, because if it's not complete then whats the point anyway.  Instead he decided to work on applied math and physics.  Since he loved the work of Turing, he wanted to build a physical Turing Machine to help out with computations, and he figured there would probably be a lot of other uses for such a machine that no one had thought of yet, and that would only become apparent once the machine was built.<p>While at the Institute for Advanced Study, Von Nueman fought a hard political fight to secure funding and permission to build the first computers, the MANIAC and the ENIAC, to the horror of the faculty at the time, including Einstein.<p>Since I am posting this at 4:30am in a thread that is 12 hours old, I will be happy if someone reads it :P<p>[1] <a href=""http://books.google.com/books/about/Turing_s_Cathedral.html?id=6sElRNGXWFIC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books/about/Turing_s_Cathedral.html?...</a>",1362990695

(Disclaimer: using imaginary numbers below to illustrate the theory.)<p>Let's say your body typically wants 1000 calories at breakfast, and you eat 1000 calories with a heavy load of carbs.  Carbohydrates with a high glycemic index cause your insulin to spike.  That signals fat cells that they should start storing energy, and they do so, tucking away 300 of the 1000 calories you ate.<p>This means your body only gets to spend 700 of the 1000 calories you ate, and as such, it says ""hey, I'm still hungry"".  You eat 300 calories worth of food.  But your fat cells are still sucking up (X%) of what you eat into storage, due to the insulin reaction.  So, your body gets 200 of those 300 it wants, and it stays a little bit hungry.  (Or, more likely, your body wants 300, but you eat 500 to make it shut up.)<p>Carbs have the unfortunate habit of converting useful calories into fat storage <i>prior to</i> processing them for the purposes of nutrition.  This means carb-heavy diets tend to cause unconscious overeating, and also constant feelings of hunger/cravings/etc.<p>One of the advantages of a paleo/keto diet is that they often avoid the type of carbohydrates that cause this problem, namely ones with a high glycemic index.  This means when you eat 1000 calories, your fat cells don't skim any off the top before your metabolism gets to them, and you get the full 1000; this means you don't end up hungry after a meal, and don't suffer from the urge to snack/eat more.  Because your body got all the energy it wanted, it doesn't start saying it's hungry again until it actually does need the nutrition, and you're more likely to eat closer to the correct amount for your body's needs.<p>The difference between the examples you give, 4500 of Paleo and 1200 of junk food, is primarily how they'd make your body react.  1200 of junk food would certainly be a caloric deficit, but you'd be ravenously hungry at that level.  (I've done 1000 calories a day for 6 months straight - it's pretty awful for the first few months.)  But with keto, you <i>could</i> eat 4500 calories in a day, but you won't want to.  When I'm done eating a keto-style meal, I am completely uninterested in food until the next.  Those meals, for me, are typically 1-2 small/medium brats with no bun.  But if I go out and cheat, and grab a burger and fries, I've got to fight the urge to follow it up with some ice cream, even though the fries and burger combined are drastically more calories than the brats I was satisfied with the meal before.<p>It's really interesting stuff.  The ""calories-in, calories-out"" model is completely right from a completely energy-based perspective, but it doesn't account for the side effects produced by the energy source, and how people react to them.",1362990084

The fact that pools are more dangerous doesn't justify owning a gun, so there is no ""cognitive dissonance"" here.</i><p>What is the useful purpose of a swimming pool exactly? Are you proposing that they are a meaningful part of our society? Is this ""use"" so valuable that it clearly outweighs the deaths it causes? You seem to in your own comment think the bicycle provides the same benefit, so why keep pools if we have such a great alternative? No one swims a gun, but no one swims to work either. At least there are people actually dependent on bikes because they can't afford cars.<p><i>> We can't eliminate all the risk.
> We can eliminate unnecessary risk (like guns).</i><p>So you think pools qualify as a necessary risk then?<p>Is it at all possible that you may just personally see no use in guns while appreciating the <i>recreational value</i> of a pool despite its risks, while at the exact same time a gun owner may see no use in pools while appreciating the <i>recreational value</i> of guns? You can't swim (useless activity) in a gun. You also can't fire a pool.<p>I can actually perfectly understand the argument ""well, both guns and pools should be outlawed then"". I really have a hard time shrugging off pool deaths because they are such a clearly useful thing that is a necessary risk for society though (however that argument works much better for car deaths vs. gun deaths).<p>Edit: Below I was just commenting on understanding your audience and thus not making arguments that won't resonate with them. There is an entire culture around gun ownership. There are some people that go shooting every day, and it really hurts your position to tell them that that part of their life is not a valid ""use"". It is actually quite similar to football in some respects. At some point in this country we may have to discuss the very real health issues associated with it, and a part of the framing of that argument should probably not belittle the attachment people have to something that is in fact quite useless (as any and all recreations are to the people that don't practice them).",1362989951

If the crystallized deductive form is the goal, intuition and construction are at least the driving forces. A serious threat to the very life of science is implied in the assertion that mathematics is nothing but a system of conclusions drawn from definitions and postulates that must be consistent but otherwise may be created by the free will of the mathematician. If this description were accurate, mathematics could not attract any intelligent person. It would be a game with definitions, rules, and syllogisms, without motive or goal. The notion that the intellect can create meaningful postulational systems at its whim is a deceptive half-truth.

Maybe this was actually what he intended, but I don't think it was.<p>But let me back track a bit. There is a lot to say here about choosing an antagonistic way of presenting an idea, but one tiny nitpick affected me in particular. I was actually following fine and agreeing perfectly well up until his proposed solution of solving everything by simply making a law. Now, the problem isn't necessarily that I don't think this is the best solution, but the fact that he clearly does not actually understand the libertarian position, and thus <i>completely fails to convince me by using the wrong counter arguments to hypothetical objections he imagines I have</i>. His assumption is that libertarians value ridiculous personal freedoms more than the environment, and thus spends his time explaining how much the externalities of wood burning outweigh whatever silly freedom I may be concerned with this week. This is equivalent to patronizing someone who is for drug legalization by explaining to them that, actually, drugs are bad, and <i>that's</i> why they need to be illegal silly.<p>I think he can't fathom that I may actually be 100% in agreement with his goal (to reduce wood burning), and yet reach a completely different conclusion as to the method to achieve it. A big part of the libertarian argument is actually quite consequentialist: make this illegal and you may very well find the the amount of wood burning go up, or at least not decreasing at all. If its obvious to you that that's not the case, then it should be easy to prove. To convince me (and it is totally possible), I'd actually be curious to know things such as: is wood burning already decreasing on its own and thus not require a law and all sorts of strange enforcement practices? Are we sure that enforcing such a law wouldn't unexpectedly require another form of pollution (wouldn't be the first time an environmental law had that result). Have we really exhausted all other approaches including education on the subject? Etc. Etc.<p>I get the sense that what he wants us to walk away with is ""look how hard the truth can be to accept if you don't know it"", but I think the real takeaway is seeing how little we understand our audience sometimes. Whether the argument is political or religious, the favored method of argumentation seems to be ""shock and awe"". Showing people that as it turns out, they're actually assholes and didn't even know it! Then following up by belittling their values and explaining why your values are more important. This rarely works. I think people's goals are actually <i>way</i> more aligned than we think they are, but understandably we have reached different conclusions on how to reach those goals (again, the drug legalization issue is a great example). To finally bring it full circle, I think this is certainly true of religious arguments. I'm certain there is a much better path than trying to beat into people's heads how stupid they've actually been their whole lives and how they're partially responsible for so much suffering in the world by perpetuating this ""terrible"" thing.",1362989198

My Dad for example has Bachelors in physics and almsot finished masters - But I can see his argument going on the lines of, ""Our body can tolerate some amount of these chemicals, it has been doing that since 10 thousand years and so it is okay"".<p>Let me give you another example. Ayurveda . There are government run colleges in India, training people to practice Ayurveda as alternative medicine. Winter may not be same in India everywhere, but Ayurveda is. Now it has been scientifically proven that, many Ayurvedic medicines contain arsenic, lead in dangerous proportions. Beyond Yoga, their usefulness as medicine is also questionable. Try having argument with someone who believes in this (I used to be one).  So, I think I understand authors POV of traditional beliefs sometimes overriding our scientific training.",1362988843

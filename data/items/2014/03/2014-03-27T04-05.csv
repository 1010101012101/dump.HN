When you perform a command, a command object is pushed onto the &quot;undo&quot; stack. When you undo a command, it&#x27;s popped off the stack, its undo() method is called, and it&#x27;s pushed onto the &quot;redo&quot; stack. When you redo a command, it&#x27;s popped off the redo stack, and executed. When you execute a new command (not an undo or redo) you push it onto the undo stack and clear out the redo stack.<p>See this SO question for further detail and links: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/701131/data-structure-used-to-implement-undo-and-redo-option"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/701131/data-structure-use...</a>",1395896217

It is a form of pre-order donation, helping to bootstrap a viable market for a product the backer believes in. From the terms of use[1]:<p>&quot;Kickstarter does not offer refunds. A Project Creator is not required to grant a Backer’s request for a refund unless the Project Creator is unable or unwilling to fulfill the reward.<p>Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill.\nProject Creators may cancel or refund a Backer’s pledge at any time and for any reason, and if they do so, are not required to fulfill the reward.&quot;<p>So, if you go on kickstarter and never have any intention to deliver rewards, you&#x27;re breaking the TOS. How often have this actually happened? I&#x27;m sure <i>some</i> number of funded projects have probably disappeared -- but is it really a significant number considering the scale of Kickstarter?<p>I also see that roughly 45% of projects are funded -- so that&#x27;s a pretty decent filter right there. For my own anecdotal experience with Kickstarter, I&#x27;ve yet to be &quot;cheated&quot; -- a couple of games I&#x27;ve bought/supported are still under development, but seem to be right on track (Elite, Start Citizen, Torment and Wasteland 2). I&#x27;ve backed some one-off projects, and helped kick-start three businesses: hexbright.com, Printrbot and peakdesignltd.com/capture/\u200E<p>Why should I be upset that my &quot;reward&quot; for supporting these are a subsidized great little product, and not half of a share of the company? I mean, the risk investing in something like any of these seem on average much larger than &quot;most probably getting a cheap, unique product&quot;. Yes, the reward is less too -- but I don&#x27;t understand why people seem to think this has something to do with investing?<p>Kickstarter provides actionable market research. That&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s a chance to trial selling your product, proving it&#x27;s viability.<p>Sure, if I had a million dollars lying around, it might have been great if, say the founder of hexbright came to me and asked me for captial, so that I could be the one benefiting from his idea, not him. But for &quot;real&quot; me, that haven&#x27;t got any substantial capital to invest, that outcome would&#x27;ve been worse. I think it&#x27;s great that Kickstarter helps lower the need for up front investment for starting a business.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/terms-of-use?ref=footer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kickstarter.com/terms-of-use?ref=footer</a>",1395895358

If I&#x27;m forced to write Java, it might better be Java 8, but if I have a choice, there are so many things (as the OP correctly states) that make Scala compelling for me beyond Lambdas that just adding that feature to Java doesn&#x27;t really mean anything to me. Ruby has Lambdas, so does Python and JavaScript, Dart and I&#x27;m sure any other modern language. I like Scala because of so many other things other than lambdas that a single comment is not enough.<p>But to name a few (some were referenced by the OP)<p>Everything is an expression, For comprehensions (especially with multiple futures, resolving the callback triangle of death in a beautiful syntax IMHO), Implicit conversions, Case classes, Pattern Matching, Tuples, The fact that everything has equals and hashcode already correctly implemented (so I can put a tuple, or even an Array as a key in a map), string interpolation, multiline string, default parameters, named parameters, built in dependency injection, most complex yet most powerful type system in any language I know of, type inference (not as good as Haskell, but better than the non existent in Java). The fact I always get the right type returned from a set of &quot;monadic&quot; actions thanks to infamous things like CanBuildFrom (which are pure genius). Let&#x27;s not forget pass by name arguments and the ability to construct a DSL. Extractors (via pattern matching). And many more.<p>I think Scala is here to stay, at least for Scala developers, I am 100% sure you will not find a single Scala developer that will say: &quot;Java 8 got lambdas? great, goodbye scala forever!&quot;. Only reason I can think of is compile time and binary compatibility. If we ignore those two, all I can say is that this just proves how Scala is in the right direction (since Java 8 lambdas and default interface methods and steams are so clearly influenced)<p>I do wish however that Scala will improve Java 8 interoperability, e.g. support functional interfaces the same way. and add new implicit conversions to Java 8 collections as well as take advantage to improvements in the JVM.<p>I will replace Scala as soon as I find a language that gives me what Scala does and does it better.  So far I didn&#x27;t find such a language (examined Haskell, Clojure, Go, Kotlin, Ceylon, Dart, TypeScript, Rust, Julia, D and Nimrod, Ruby Python, JavaScript and C#, some of them were very promising but since I need a JVM language, and preferably a statically typed one, it narrowed down the choices pretty quickly)<p>Java 8 is by far not even close, sorry.

Red is hypothesized to be linked to aggression and danger in evolution, and these links are enhanced by culture-specific uses of red. Thus, color meanings are thought to be grounded in biologically based proclivities and learned associations. However, to date, there has been no direct evidence for the influence of experience on the red effect. This study focused on whether experience could change the psychological effects of the color red. In the context of the Chinese stock market, contrary to the meaning generally associated with red as negative and green as positive, red represents a rise in stock price and green stands for a decrease. An experiment using a 2×2 between subjects factorial design demonstrated that red (compared with green) impaired Chinese college students’ performance on an IQ test (in accordance with the red effect), but the opposite effect was found among stockbrokers. These results provide direct evidence of learned color meanings, in support of the general model of color effect. ...<p>which suggests that red has a non-trivial learned color meaning on people, and leaving open the possibility that it&#x27;s mostly, if not all, culturally based.<p>Or consider <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20677892"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20677892</a> :<p>> in a series of 7 experiments we demonstrate that women perceive men to be more attractive and sexually desirable when seen on a red background and in red clothing, and we additionally show that status perceptions are responsible for this red effect.<p>They hypothesize that red is not a general signal of danger, but has many meanings.

It has been argued that there are universal preferences for some colors over others (e.g., Eysenck, 1941), universal sex differences (e.g., Hurlbert & Ling, 2007), and universal mechanisms or dimensions that govern these preferences (e.g., Palmer & Schloss, 2010). However, there have been surprisingly few cross-cultural investigations of color preference and none from nonindustrialized societies that are relatively free from the common influence of global consumer culture. Here, we compare the color preferences of British adults to those of Himba adults who belong to a nonindustrialized culture in rural Namibia. British and Himba color preferences are found to share few characteristics, and Himba color preferences display none of the so-called &quot;universal&quot; patterns or sex differences.<p>Since you say that there is a &quot;fair amount of literature&quot; on this topic, can you point it out?

If there wasn&#x27;t any fraud, and that could be proven, then at least it could be shown that Karpeles was just a bad businessman, not a fraudster, and his name could be cleared.  This limbo leaves so many questions unanswered that it&#x27;s hard to know if we&#x27;re ever going to find out what truly happened.<p>Mt. Gox recently claimed they found 200,000 BTC that they&#x27;d lost track of.  If their claim can be taken at face value, then I think it&#x27;s plausible they may have panicked back when their losses first became clear to them in February, leading them to blame it on malleability even though they didn&#x27;t really have a clue where their money went or why.  They probably felt they had to tell people <i>something</i>, and saying &quot;we lost track of >750,000 BTC for unknown reasons&quot; may have been less desirable than blaming their problems on something tangible, like transaction malleability.  Unfortunately for them, it turns out that they were wrong about that.<p>So here we are.  All that&#x27;s been demonstrated is that consumers currently have very little protection in this space, and that patio11 and others were right to warn people to be very careful with bitcoin.",1395893819

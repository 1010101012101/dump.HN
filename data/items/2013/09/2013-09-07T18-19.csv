This is one topic near and dear to my heart which I think a lot of us struggle with since a lot of it can be so counter-intuitive. Reading through &quot;Java Concurrency in Practice&quot;, some of the ideas and best practices really popped out at me as something that could be translated into an abstract art style game, and for some reason, the mechanics of guitar hero with multiple guitars visualized in my head. It would be a fast paced game with trippy colors and great digitized procedural music, and you shouldn&#x27;t need to know anything about programming to play. Threads could be visualized as lines going through space, and you have to protect data units with good use of abstractions, queues, locks etc so they don&#x27;t get corrupted. And the better you get, the more threads you have to deal with and more advanced topics/tools you&#x27;d need to use. I&#x27;m not a game developer, but I&#x27;d love it if such a game existed :)",1378580231

You, who most decidedly do not think that government is an abomination, as a lawyer, are logically consistent in thinking that it should not be dismantled.<p>> Much like a corporation is the legal stand-in for the will of the collective shareholders, a government is the societal stand-in for the will of the people at large.<p>Except that it most clearly is not.<p>> A society that tries to maintain no government, or very limited government, is at an unstable point. In the best case it will collapse from internal conflict but be left alone from there (e.g. Somalia, tribal areas of Afghanistan/Pakistan). In the normal case the society will simply be eventually overrun by those who choose to organize (e.g. USA vs. the Native Americans, Hitler vs. the appeasers), but a government will spring up again one way or another.<p>That&#x27;s a normalcy bias, there have been many points throughout history with no centralised productivity extracting parasitic force initiating agency. In fact, the variant we have now with extremely high direct taxation on the incomes of almost all productive activity within a society is the historical anathema. Not only that, but this fails to take into account the methods of control the state actually uses to exercise control on its population, and that currency control was recently removed from their hands.<p>Agorism becomes a very real threat under these circumstances<p>As a nash equilibrium, an involuntary centralised productivity extracting parasitic force initiating agency is not at all stable. It stands to reason that it will only be able to maintain control by either force or fraud. Right now they&#x27;re going with fraud, from the amount of discontent I see with the political state of the world I don&#x27;t know how much longer it will last until they devolve to force.",1378580109

6346093,comment,6345433,6345985,6,0,bartonfink,,,"One approach I&#x27;ve seen that works well for untangling gnarly SQL is to refactor those mega-queries into smaller, component queries that are pieced together by application code. This keeps the processing on the DB server but avoids the pain that comes with programming in SQL. I rather like SQL, but it doesn&#x27;t handle complexity well at all (e.g. maintaining a &quot;variable&quot; to be used in different parts of the query).<p>For example, I once worked on a Foursquare clone originally written by a hardcore PostgreSQL nut. This system had a query that, if memory serves, returned a list of places of a certain type within a geographic area along with user activity on those places (votes, comments, etc). This was around a 75 line SQL query that actually wasn&#x27;t that fast (response times from the DB were roughly 1 second even with every join indexed). We rewrote that query into 4 smaller queries (place ID&#x27;s within that area, place ID&#x27;s within that category, hydrating those places from the filtered ID&#x27;s and then getting the user info), and that cut our DB response by about 70% in addition to making the system easier to work with. This required roughly 10 lines of Java code and a variable - a list of ID&#x27;s that we got first and passed into each other query. It also freed us up to do other things - for instance, if performance were still a problem, queries 2-4 could have been done asynchronously behind a latch. By lifting the &quot;glue&quot; out of SQL and into a better language, it freed us to do new things, and it freed the database from having to juggle unnecessary complexity while planning and executing its queries.",1378580058

A Unix Timestamp alone unambiguously (1) identifies an absolute point in time; there is no need to involve time zones, which are a political concept.  A Unix Timestamp can be converted to any timezone and vice-versa.  Any representation that is based on civil time is going to be more complicated and have more edge cases.<p>Thirdly, time zone offsets like -03:00 do not actually specify a time zone; they specify a time zone <i>offset</i>.  These two are not the same thing.  There are multiple time zones that can have a -03:00 offset, depending on the time of year.  Even given a specific time of year, the time zone offset may not uniquely identify the time zone. For example, Arizona doesn&#x27;t do daylight savings, so if you see a -07:00 time in the summer it could either be a PDT time (used on the west coast) or a MST time (used in Arizona).<p>Unix Timestamps have many advantages over text-based timestamp representations.  They are much simpler to parse and have far fewer lexical variations.  They are never invalid (whereas text-based dates like 2000-01-32 can be).  They can be stored directly in a numeric variable.

  abstract class Animal
  end

  class Dog < Animal
    def talk
    end
  end

  class Cat < Animal
    def talk
    end
  end

  class Mouse < Animal
  end

  x = foo ? Dog.new : Cat.new
  x.talk # undefined method &#x27;talk&#x27; for Mouse
</code></pre>
That is, even though &quot;x&quot; is never assigned a Mouse, Crystal infers the type of &quot;x&quot; to be Animal+, so it really doesn&#x27;t know which types are in and considers all cases.<p>Again, this is most of the time something good: if you introduce a new class in your hierarchy you probably want it to respond to some same methods as the other classes in the hierarchy.",1378578901

I haven&#x27;t been involved in Whois and tld stuff in a while, but back in the day, these host Whois records were allowed because the gtld servers needed glue for domain names - after all, if your domain name is ycombinator.com and your name server is ns1.ycombinator.com, how can a resolver recurse to find that, unless te gtld servers also have an A record for that label/object?

Having a view or stored proc with business logic lets it be shared across different components of the same app or even across separate apps that share a database. An extreme (yet common) example of calls best done on the DB itself is a SUM of price X quantity or any other grouping operation. Rather than moving N rows to the client, the server can aggregate it all and just send back the result.<p>If CPU usage on your DB really is your bottleneck (<i>and seriously it&#x27;s probably not</i>) then you should look into federating logic out to your app. Otherwise the centralization of app logic alone is worth it.",1378578796

Start with <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm#dtap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm#dtap</a> . I linked to DTaP but there are many others on that page.<p>To report a problem, go to <a href=""http://vaers.hhs.gov/index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vaers.hhs.gov/index</a> , which is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.<p>Did you get any paperwork about the immunization? There should have been a flyer or handout like <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/dtap.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/dtap.pdf</a> . This has information both about VAERS, as well as about the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.<p>The &quot;ap&quot; in DTaP vaccine means &quot;acellular Pertussis&quot;, which means it uses antigens of the pertussis pathogen rather than whole cells. There should be no infectious material that could cause a bad cough a week later. (It also has fewer side-effects than, but is also less effective than the whole cell vaccine.)<p>I read that newspaper article you mentioned. It said &quot;Infants under 2 months of age are at the highest risk, accounting for five of Texas&#x27; [six] deaths this year&quot; and &quot;80 percent of those were children under 2 months old, who are too young to be vaccinated against the disease.&quot;<p>This is a very different situation than what you are describing, where a cough starts a week after the vaccination. I don&#x27;t think you can make the inference that it&#x27;s a side-effect of the vaccination itself based on that article.<p>The article points out that the new vaccine formulation doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective for as long as the old one. What&#x27;s likely happening is that adults whose immunity has worn off are acting as carriers for the disease, and infecting babies and children who haven&#x27;t received any immunization for the disease.<p>This is probably one of the reasons that the Td immunization (DTaP is for children) recommends &quot;All adults should get a booster dose of Td every 10 years.&quot;<p>(While it doesn&#x27;t confer a life-long immunity, the goal is to prevent pertussis in children; they have the highest risk of death if infected.)<p>I don&#x27;t know what to say to you, other than that I, some anonymous person on the internet, agrees with your doctor that &quot;it probably wasn&#x27;t Pertussis.&quot;<p>> &quot;even considering the low expected rate of serious adverse vaccination events, it is not possible that this clinic has never had a reportable event&quot;<p>There are different styles of reporting. First off, 25% of the children who receive the DTaP vaccine get a fever, 25% get redness or swelling where the shot was given, and 25% get soreness or tenderness where the shot was given. Your doctor has almost certainly seen those side effects.<p>But they aren&#x27;t reported because they are expected. Again, they should be in the handout you got as part of the information about immunization. No doctor is going to report such mild problems.<p>Then there are the &quot;moderate problems&quot;, like seizure, non-stop crying, and a fever of over 105F. These occur in less than 1:1000 children, which means there should have been a couple of children in your clinic who have had these reactions.<p>However, it&#x27;s up to the doctor to decide if this is severe enough to report. The 
VAERS guideline include &quot;clinically significant adverse health events following vaccination&quot;, &quot;vaccination error [that] may pose a safety risk&quot;, &quot;or that the error would be preventable with public health action or education&quot; but &quot;accepts all reports.&quot;<p>These moderate problems are likely not &#x27;significant adverse.&#x27; The severe cases seem to happen in 1:1 million cases or rarer for the vaccinations I looked at. Even across all of the vaccinations, it&#x27;s unlikely that your doctor&#x27;s office would have had that happen to one of their patients.<p>So, that&#x27;s one style of reporting. Another style occurs when they get the above statistics in the first place. In that case, they enroll doctors into the program, and have the doctors report <i>all</i> problems that arise after the vaccination. This can be compared to a baseline reference from children who haven&#x27;t yet had the vaccine. (Eg, the three weeks before the vaccine compared to the three weeks after.) That&#x27;s used to weed out coincidental correlations. After all, kids do get sick even with vaccines.<p>This second style of reporting is what&#x27;s used to list the known risks of the vaccine, with the first style of reporting use to get information about the very rare cases.<p>What should the doctor have done to improve your sense of confidence? Run a test for pertussis even though your child didn&#x27;t have the symptoms for the disease? Make a report even though it wasn&#x27;t a severe adverse effect? The information you wanted - what to do if there was a severe affect - should have been information you already had. I&#x27;m somewhat surprised that the staff didn&#x27;t know that, since I (an anonymous stranger on the internet) knew it existed, but I also only know your side of the story.",1378578780

Yes, this means giving up the unthinking conveniences you&#x27;ve probably become accustomed to. For instance, if you care about the security of &quot;your data&quot;, you simply cannot have unfettered access on a contemporary mobile phone. For that capability to be created, we have to stop <i>pretending</i> that it already exists. Otherwise, the demand shifts towards MHz+eyecandy bumps instead of for phones that create security for their <i>users</i>.<p>[0] The primary thing for a secure technology is not to be assuredly secure, but for it to have a design goals that are compatible with security. For instance, OpenSSH may still have gaping holes in it. But when these are discovered, they are considered unambiguous bugs and they&#x27;re patched to be closer to the platonic.

The professor is Jeff Ullman. A legend. For free.<p>Machine Learning: A second version of Andrew Ng just ended. The third edition will be offered soon.<p>see.stanford.edu is also a very nice place to learn. They are actual stanford classes taped, and offered for free, online. I`m taking the three introdutory classes, and the machine learning classes.<p>Also, there are several architecture, compilers and algorithms classes too. After my first course (cs50.net), i realized that colleges (at least for CS) are redundant right now. They can be awsome.

The hopelessness. It&#x27;s a vicious, killing cycle.<p>Just about everything in this kid&#x27;s environment and experience was negative. Yes, we can rise above, but it&#x27;s really hard to see that there&#x27;s even somewhere to go when you haven&#x27;t seen it in your life.<p>Unemployment of 16.3 percent. Does that mean that &quot;they&quot; are lazy? Or are there other more fundamental factors?",1378577100

It really depends on how you want to use it:<p>1) Travel?  Travel to China? -- then worry about what VPNs are blocked<p>2) Need strong anonymity against the US government?  You&#x27;re probably out of luck, but Tor might be a good technology to use for now.  Really, you want something which is message-based, not streams, and can have mix-net style latency, not onion routing.  Other than email (mixmaster/mixminion, both too small in deployment to be safe, now), you&#x27;re out of luck.  Stay tuned, though.  (You also probably need more than just the network -- incognito mode, some kind of filtering proxy, etc.)<p>3) QoS/etc. evasion on e.g. Comcast for torrenting?  I&#x27;d probably go with the torrentfreak recommendations. (<a href=""http://torrentfreak.com/vpn-services-that-take-your-anonymity-seriously-2013-edition-130302/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://torrentfreak.com/vpn-services-that-take-your-anonymit...</a>)  Generally I think a seedbox is a <i>far</i> better solution for torrenting than a VPN, though.<p>4) Great Mac support?  That is GetCloak&#x27;s focus.<p>5) Mobile?  The PPTP/L2TP stuff built in is the best, although the security is weaker than SSL or IPsec VPNs.<p>6) Price?  AnchorFree is free.  The others range from (generally) $3-20/mo/user.<p>7) Need to tie in with your existing on-premises networks, AWS VPC, or support multiple clients, or do DLP, etc?  That&#x27;s what cryptoseal&#x27;s business product tries to do, or you could use a conventional on-premises vpn hardware appliance from Juniper, Cisco, etc.<p>8) etc.<p>There isn&#x27;t one best choice.",1378577013

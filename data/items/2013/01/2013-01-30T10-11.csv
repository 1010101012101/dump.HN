VC returns don't come from minimum competency.  They come from a disproportionate number of home runs.  Funding for familiarity with the school is absolutely NOT making the best investment with the money for which you are responsible, because it's not a decision criteria for putting risk capital to work - it's a risk avoidance strategy.  (As you seem to instinctively see by your use of the word safe.)<p>The question isn't whether ""if all else is equal should I hire someone like me"" it's whether you should prioritize a certain credential over other factors, as happens in a lot of hiring.  But to come back to your ""is it really that bad a decision?"" I think most evidence points to YES, increased diversity of background and opinion benefits decision making groups - in this case companies companies - more than homogeneity, with its tendency towards systematic error.<p>To challenge your final point given the fact that a lot of the top schools have large numbers of legacy hires, and getting into them often involves far more factors than mere merit you're hoping that the delta in better schooling techniques outweighs recruitment drawbacks.  Maybe, but I think it's far from proven.<p>Nobody is saying DON'T hire people from top schools, with great reputations, and track records of turning out quality candidates.  Of course not.  What's being said is that optimizing your hiring process to a handful of schools, given how many others are doing the same, makes it unlikely you're getting the very best candidates on the market - I don't see how this is anything other than statistically self-evident.",1359542615

One may even infer that the ""devious webs"" are being cast by the reformed Russian Orthodox Church.<p>I would also note that the archaic nature of some the terms she uses (""наипаче"", ""многокозненных сетей вражиих"", ""не добре"", ""седмицу""), and the archaic sentence structure is more consistent with the language used in the Russian Bible, rather than with the conventions of the early 20th century. The English equivalent would be the language found in the King James Bible.<p>A note to astral303: I noticed that you translated ""сырая земля"" as ""raw earth"", which is interesting, because while ""сырой"" means both ""raw"" and ""damp"", it most certainly is meant as ""damp"" when describing the earth. I know ""raw earth"" sounds more natural in English, but I think simply saying ""ground"" is the best equivalent, since I can't think of an English turn of phrase that invokes the connotations of describing the ground as damp in the intended manner.",1359541977

I suspect most people underestimate just how many different separate electronic systems, usually developed and manufactured by independent specialists, are involved in controlling an aircraft (not to mention the new ones that would need to be developed for when things go wrong: there's a big difference between an autopilot landing an an instrument landing system and a pilot gliding his plane to a perfect stop on the Hudson River.)<p>Also worth pointing out that the CEO of Google (yes...I <i>know</i> his company tests driverless <i>cars</i>) isn't really more of an expert on the FAA certification process than the average person here. \nI think he's on the right side of the bet, but I'd also note that the avionics which assist the pilot in controlling the plane and monitoring what's going on have changed more in the last 50 years than any other aspect of commercial aircraft.<p>Commercial considerations are a bigger factor than certification in new aircraft programme inertia: airlines' economies of scale hugely favour existing models, and expensive radical innovation in aircraft programmes can often be improved upon at lower research cost by rivals.",1359541730

Even if he breaks the spirit of a law (and I am not sure that he does: perhaps that achievement goes to the copyright lobby), far greater criminals are the beastly, sprawling mass that is government, commercial mass media, global finance, and perhaps the science of public relations. We are all but one exploitable citizenry (or shall I say, 'human resource', 'consumer' or 'market'?) under them.  And quite frankly, if Kim fights for the dissuasion of IP, it is not a great stretch to say that he fights in part for the same cause as Aaron did, albeit in different ways, and with monetary benefit. That is not necessarily stupid or evil, actually, IMHO, it's pretty damn smart: in other words, a really good hack.<p>After all, the law is the law. It is a system. Legal systems have been exploited since time immemorial. (I am sure there are lawyers reading this) Private citizens and large corporations exploit it regularly (a phenomenon particularly associated with modern American culture, but also multinationals). What we must not do is allow governments, the same governments raising omnipresent surveillance against us, to evade the spirit of the law, when they are supposed to be serving us... and not the other way around. For should we allow that, there is no easy way to go back... and some within this community would argue that it is almost upon us.<p>Remember, if the society you argue for is one in which it is not possible to break the law without being caught, then the society you are arguing for is totalitarian.<p>To quote Assange once more (sorry, he is far too well focused on these matters to avoid referencing): <i>I have a view that we are dealing with really tremendously big economic and political forces, as Jérémie said, and the likely outcome is that the natural efficiencies of surveillance technologies compared to the number of human beings will mean that slowly we will end up in a global totalitarian surveillance society — by totalitarian I mean a total surveillance — and that perhaps there will just be the last free living people, those who understand how to use this cryptography to defend against this complete, total surveillance, and some people who are completely off-grid, neo-Luddites that have gone into the cave, or traditional tribes-people who have none of the efficiencies of a modern economy and so their ability to act is very small.</i> — Julian Assange, <i>Cypherpunks</i>, 2012.",1359541610

So they have time to simply teach more stuff.<p>For example I am in the UK and studied computing at an FE college (probably equivalent to a US community college) and also at a ""red brick"" university.<p>Both courses contained introductory Java programming modules. At university the first few lectures were spent whizzing through the Java syntax and by about the fifth lecture we were being introduced to BST implementations.<p>The college course took about the same time to explain the difference between an object and a class and many students still struggled.<p>Of course if you are comparing ""good college"" to ""really good college"" the difference in intelligence might be much more minimal and admission comes down to whoever studied the hardest for their exams.",1359540300

LiCO4 does have advantages though, mainly related to energy density. For something like a car, or a plane, higher energy density in cells means greater efficiency for weight vs. energy potential. Also, it isn't like lithium cobalt is going to explode if you look at it wrong. Nearly all the risk can be prevented by proper cell management, via electronics.<p>LiFePO4 and LiMn2O4 have the advantage of larger output potential, which for your bike, allows a large amount of power to be put into the electric motor from a small battery. Electric cars/planes get around this by putting lots of cells in parallel, but requires quite a lot of regulation.",1359540063

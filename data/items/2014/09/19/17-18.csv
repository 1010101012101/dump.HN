If you need more states (i.e. more steps beyond 3 like Trello), we offer pipelines that do just that. We believe having both these systems in our product allows our customers to speak a common language when it comes to priorities. We would definitely be open to allowing you to host Catalist directly on premises. Happy to give a demo, all you need to do is sign up and I&#x27;ll contact you.<p>Catalist [<a href=""http://www.catalist.me"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catalist.me</a>]",1411149525

EG, they are constrained to roads and the interstate was a far more revolutionary change than the catalytic converter, direct injection, or DOHC or whatever. You&#x27;re basically arguing that fuel efficiency is greater, but fuel scarcity is another topic altogether. It remains the case that petrol is still the fuel of choice--not electric or some other source--becuase of its inherent efficency in terms of energy per unit of mass. So, betweeen the fuel constraint ant the roadway constraint, cars are a fractional better than they were a generation ago...but not a categorical or even significant leap by any stretch. If you read some history of LA and compare the changes from 1920 to 1940 you would have seen a radical shift in the impact of the automobile. Heck, even the impact of the container ship alone is far more interesting at a macro/absolute level.  Car safety and fuel efficiency are simply very minor improvements on a fundamentally  unchanged basic engineering platform: the two ton, four-wheel ICM constrained to a limited right of way, and a very similar feasible safe-speed constraint.<p>Note, that one better argument here is these are as much legal/social as technological constrainst placed upon the automobile. Many people in the younger genreations would rather see the (at least the personal) automobile dis-associated with its role of primacy in western society.<p>This is more or less feasible depending of course on technology and other elements improving the constraints on urban planning. The lack of the removal of these constrainsts (both technological and economic) is again also a sign that technology has/had plateaued in the area of civil engineering. It may have been improved, but in terms of radical improvement...not so much.<p>Of course, shale gas and hydro-fracking may yet do more than keep the status quo in place...but fundamentally...not much has changed in Californial in the past 40-50 years in terms of day to day getting around.",1411149506

8341561,comment,8340283,8340946,7,0,DigitalJack,,,"Verilog is a hardware description language.  You describe the hardware connections, sometimes with high level constructs like &quot;for&quot; loops, sometimes by just describing the gates themselves.  In a sense, it is similar to HTML describing a web page, but with higher level constructs available like loops.  So maybe HTML with a templating engine is a closer analogy.<p>For simulation, you compile verilog with a software tool into something executable by a VM or natively.  This is heavily event based in execution, with events being edge transitions (a signal going from 0->1 or 1->0) occuring at specific times--for most (but not all) cases.<p>For producing something usable by an FPGA or a foundry for an ASIC, instead of compiling you synthesize.  Different tool.  Synthesis is the process of taking higher level hardware descriptions and outputing the lower level descriptions usually called a netlist.  It&#x27;s akin to translating C into assembly for example.<p>Device specific tools can take that netlist and create a bitstream for configuring an FPGA, or the foundry can take that netlist and go through a process called &quot;physical synthesis&quot; which takes the netlist and chooses from the foundry&#x27;s library the components that will work best for that netlist to operate at speed, figure out where to place them on the die, and insert buffers as needed.<p>What the GP was asking: is this design small enough to fit in an FPGA.  This question is orthogonal to the language used to describe the hardware.<p>I&#x27;d say they answer is yes, depending on the FPGA you choose.

The vision, ideas and UX execution behind them were clearly thought up by inspired and talented people. What I mean to say is that from a purely technical standpoint, they would be trivially easy to build, so I don&#x27;t see why you would need to raise millions to pay for &quot;software engineers&quot; to build and maintain your initial product. They are just simple CRUD apps, a class of system of which there are a deluge of accessible and easy to pick up resources and frameworks available to learn how to work with, and a huge pool of cheap developers available. The technical problems that they solve are not novel in any way. While some of the Silicon Valley brogrammer types like to paint themselves as these renegade code wizards hacking on these super hard to solve problems(probably because it helps them get a paycheck), the truth is the problems imposed by CRUD apps are some of the most already solved around. I don&#x27;t mean to say that there aren&#x27;t plenty of code wizards hacking on hard to solve problems, but I bet they sure aren&#x27;t CRUD related. Hell, I don&#x27;t think its unreasonable at all that 1 or 2 completely non-technical cofounders could team up and learn Ruby on Rails or Django in a couple of months and put a viable product together. If you use an IaaS/PaaS system, Google or Amazon or whoever handles scalability problems for you - its literally as easy as moving a slider and paying more money. Why pay $230k a year for a &quot;scalability/reliability engineer&quot;, when I could pay exponentially less to Google or AWS and not have to worry about anything? Even if those didn&#x27;t exist, have you ever heard of a user facing web company failing because their tech stack wasn&#x27;t efficient, because it was built by someone just average at coding who chose an easy to work with system with a fast dev cycle and not a &quot;Full stack Javascript distributed scalability Guru&quot;? No, because by the point where the efficiency of their tech stack became a problem, they would have enough capital to hire 10 engineers to rewrite the whole system in Scala or whatever flavor of the month stack tech bloggers happened to be writing about if they so chose.<p>If your company required some kind of technology that only someone with specialized skills could work with, I would understand. Robotics software? Sure. Biotech? Sure. Life-critical systems? Sure. But I won&#x27;t be told that photo sharing and social media apps in this day and age require that much capital to build.<p>And networking? It seems to be that tech, is one of the fields in which this matters less than others to build a successful company, which is why it attracts so many of the engineer types who hate dealing with bullshit. They don&#x27;t want to deal with bureaucracies and market analysis, they just want to build awesome stuff. I&#x27;m certainly not saying it doesn&#x27;t matter at all, but I find it hard to believe that people would sell away stakes in their companies just for &quot;networking opportunities&quot;.<p>Google was unlike these companies, in that the product was unique in both idea and technical implementation. The idea was original - organizing search results by relevancy, and the algorithm behind the PageRank implementation required a bit of high level math. The actual engine was implemented in C++, not exactly the easiest language to work with. But like I said, Google was pretty much bootstrapped until they really did need the money. They didn&#x27;t immediately raise millions prelaunch and headhunt the best engineers in the valley. The founders were bright CS people who built their thing, ran out of a garage, and solved problems on their own for as long as they could. When they received their first investment they hadn&#x27;t even incorporated yet - they had to go file the papers and wait a week before depositing the money in an account. It would seem that the average founder has gone from being the type who is a tinkerer primarily interested in tech and doing stuff that hasn&#x27;t been done before(think Sergey and Larry, Bill Gates, Wozniak, Paul Graham, Zuckerberg)- but with a side interest in business, now to the type who is primarily interested in business and sees tech only as a means to an end, and raising as much capital as possible and throwing it at developers and marketing people as a means to achieve that end. \nI don&#x27;t mean this to sound condescending or whatever, I&#x27;m just trying to come up with reasons here.",1411148079

Everything else has.  Seatbelts.  Airbags.  Hybrids.  Automatic transmissions allow more people to drive, and are now faster/better than manual.  We moved from carburetors to fuel injection to direct injection, dramatically increasing the ability to control combustion in each cylinder.  We went from massive V8 and V12 engines (the entire 1950s Cadillac line produced about 300 horsepower from a 6 liter V8 -- a modern import sedan can produce almost the same on a 2 liter V4 e.g., the Hyundai 2.0 liter engine).  Superchargers allowed greater performance, turbochargers unlocked greater efficiency.  Radial tires were barely a thing in 1950, and advancements in tires have made cars dramatically safer.  Catalytic converters and electronic emission controls returned LA&#x27;s atmosphere to health.  Etc.<p>If there was any doubt, check out this chart:\n<a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_otfwl2zc6Qc/TIp8lXB5h2I/AAAAAAAAOW8/fmXi_SCP-jw/s1600/highway2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_otfwl2zc6Qc/TIp8lXB5h2I/AAAAAAAAOW...</a><p>Highway fatalities per mile traveled are about 80% lower than in 1950.

Or, moreso, for their boss.

There&#x27;s a certain meritocratic vibe with dancers where with just simple repetition and hacker mindset you can become quite good, and people will respect that however your physical appearance. You can make lots of really great friends in a short time. I think that&#x27;s one of the greatest life hacks a depressed hacker can do. You learn to interact with people easily as there is a very clear framework on how you approach people, there is always a big shared interest to talk about, and the amount of calories it can burn is incredible. I&#x27;m sure one can accomplish this with other shared activities, for example sports, but the amount of positive influence latin dances can do to a hacker is in my opinion unparalleled.",1411146137

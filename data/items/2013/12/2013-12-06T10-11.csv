This is something great. I don&#x27;t grant location permissions to social apps to avoid sharing my location unintentionally. They work just fine.<p>- The long list of permissions on Google Play store does not really help when the app just wants to be able to pause something when phone rings and that requires absolute access to phone services. That causes a scary list for legitimate apps almost always.<p>To be fair, Android&#x27;s way of having them listed makes it possible to assess an app&#x27;s intention before installing it. That&#x27;s great and all for me and you, but did not help 50+ million users in this case.",1386327587

6860477,comment,6859142,6859748,3,0,yaantc,,,"I fully agree. A lot of people say Moore&#x27;s law is the transistors density doubling every 18 months (or 2 years, it varied). But this misses the economic angle that was present from the start: Moore talked about the density of the least cost process.<p>So Moore&#x27;s law stops either when we cannot cram more transistors in a given area, or when we cannot increase density without raising the cost per transistor.\nFrom what I&#x27;ve read I agree it&#x27;s the economics variant that will end Moore&#x27;s law. We&#x27;ll have ways to shrink / increase performance, but not sure if there will be enough market to justify the rising costs.<p>A lot is riding on the continuation or end of Moore&#x27;s law, so we should expect a lot of spin on this issue. I note that Intel claims they will decrease the cost per transistor until 10 nm at least, which is not the case for other fabs. But those other fabs are more transparent on costs than Intel, and Intel said they will produce a low cast modem+AP chip at... TSMC. Mmmm...<p>We have very interesting times ahead of us. Not only in silicon: a lot of progress in all areas was fueled by cheap computing power. A halt in silicon progress would be felt everywhere. Case in point: I&#x27;m in telecommunications. Every big steps was enabled by more computation per watt. That&#x27;s what enabled to move from single channel TDM to CDMA to OFDMA with wider bands. If we can&#x27;t increase exponentially the amount of computation per watt, then don&#x27;t expect an exponential increase in wireless throughput either. It will progress, as everything, but at a slower pace.",1386327138

6860471,comment,6856851,6857142,2,0,mtdewcmu,,,"I think you may have hit on something subtle. To me, it&#x27;s better to have two completely distinct modes: I&#x27;m either dealing with errors or not. Then if an error occurs, I can expect one of two things -- either it should be handled or it should crash. I&#x27;ve noticed in some exception-using code I&#x27;ve encountered that a lot of times, error conditions are tested and then not really handled -- they&#x27;re either silently ignored, or dealt with by some half-measure. To me, silent failures are much more insidious than crashes. This halfway style of error handling is the worst of all worlds, IMO, and it might be encouraged by exceptions. Java forces you to acknowledge errors that you have no need to, and probably pushes you toward this gray area when you&#x27;re not sure how to handle things yet. Then, later, it&#x27;s totally non-obvious what&#x27;s truly handled and what isn&#x27;t. It also clutters up your code. Clarity is often more beneficial than reflexive error-checking.",1386327021

I haven&#x27;t used Python (I might be the only one), so I can only speculate on whether it&#x27;s truly more bug-prone than PHP. But one possible reason could be the relatively straightforward behavior of PHP, and C code. (My experience is with non-OO PHP, mainly from hacking Drupal modules, which might make a difference). C and (older) PHP have a small number of data types and few or no hidden behaviors. Neither is OO. I wonder if OO might contribute to long-term instability, because since OO languages are rich in types, they tend to let the language make inferences and allow types to alter the meaning of syntax. For predictable code, you probably want a language that isn&#x27;t too smart and always gives the same meaning to the same code.",1386326264

There is a difference in the way git and mercurial handles anonomous branches (git removes them after a while), which i&#x27;ve already said a couple of times. There is however, no difference in how checkout and update works.<p>And I&#x27;m not shouting, that would make people at this office stare, and I don&#x27;t like them staring. I instead wrote in all caps as I&#x27;ve repeated the fact that the two commands does the exact same thing, but you seem to be hellbent on ignoring that simple fact.<p>The commit is not lost in the git UI. You can either use &quot;git reflog&quot; or &quot;git fsck --lost-found&quot; to retrieve anonomous heads. If you want to keep them around, give them a name and you&#x27;re done.<p>If you really want to view all branches, even anonomous ones, like you can with hg log, you can use &quot;git log --graph --decorate $(git rev-list -g --all)&quot;<p>> After 90 days, it&#x27;s actually lost, or sooner if you do a casual &quot;git gc&quot;.<p>If the reflog contains the last 90 days (doesn&#x27;t it default to 14 days?), that commit will remain for 90 days, unless you delete the reflog. A &quot;git gc&quot; doesn&#x27;t change this. As the commit is still in the reflog, &quot;git gc&quot; can&#x27;t remove it, becouse the commits are referenced by the reflog. As a side-note, git push internally calls git gc (last I checked).<p>> There is no problem to solve when you commit at an earlir commit on hg.<p>Actually, this creates a new head which means you either have to use a named branch or --force the push. In git you don&#x27;t have to make this choice. You do however have to tell git that you want the changes to stick around by adding a reference (branch or tag) to that anonomous branch within 14 days (before the commits exit the reflog).<p>If you&#x27;re just testing something out, and find out you don&#x27;t really need that code, you leave it unreferenced, and it will be removed eventually. I prefer this to manually using &quot;hg strip&quot; whenever storage gets low.<p>Besides, if you create a head with work you want to keep around, why wouldn&#x27;t you reference it?",1386325820

6860404,comment,6856851,6860161,2,0,alexkus,,,"Exactly. Writing libraries in C means you have to be much more strict than simple throwaway single execution binaries.<p>What our company has ended up doing is wrappering most low level functions with the common code around it. For example, fopen() may fail and return EINTR if the process received a signal just as it was opening a file (we use signals to tell processes to reread their config so this does happen albeit rarely) so the wrapper calls fopen() in a do/while loop that repeats on EINTR (and a few others). It saves you from writing the same 50 odd lines each time you want to open a simply open a file.<p>In an exception led world you&#x27;d still have to do the same thing, but with different syntactic sugar. You can&#x27;t just fail and bubble up the exception without dealing with the few exceptions you must deal with and repeat, and you can&#x27;t just repeat on every exception as most will just fail again and again. You end up writing code to do the same thing just in different styles.<p>Checking the return values of every single function call, and dealing with it, can make the code verbose (one line of code and then 10+ lines dealing with errors) but it is worth it in the end for bullet proof programs. Also code where you have to undo all of the work already done in the function up until that point, which can get a little tedious, i.e.:-<p><pre><code>    APP_RET makefoo( char *fname )\n    {\n      char *foo,*bar;\n      thingy_t *qux;\n      size_t len;\n    \n      ASSERT( fname );\n    \n      len = strlen( fname );\n    \n      foo = malloc( len+1 );\n      if( foo == NULL ) {\n         return( ENOMEM );\n      }\n      bar = malloc( (2*len)+1 );\n      if( bar == NULL ) {\n         free( foo );\n         return( ENOMEM );\n      }\n      qux = malloc( sizeof( thingy_t ) );\n      if( qux == NULL ) {\n         free( foo );\n         free( bar );\n         return( ENOMEM );\n      }\n      ...\n      return( APP_OK );\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s the job of anything calling makefoo() to deal with the various errors it can return, but the idea is to return the minimum number of unique error codes as necessary to avoid proliferation of error codes to the higher and higher functions. Many calling functions will only really care about success or failure, and will just use the return code to log out the reason for the failure.<p>The wrappers help deal with many situations; did fwrite() write all of the bytes we wanted or just some of them? Well, our wrapper around fwrite will handle short writes and repeat the call depending on the result of ferror().",1386325674

6860378,comment,6858542,6859848,21,0,crayonVision,,,"My experience was a few years back. When I was starting, I realised that getting clients with no records and rating in your profile was hard. I set to build up my profile. After filling the descriptive data, one thing that makes profiles to standout, are skill ratings. One can take online tests, and get achievements. I took various tests, and with effort got some good ratings, only to realise that some folks had managed to game the test, and got 99-100% ratings on all the most important tests. The sadness started. I resigned to never achieving competitive ratings with the cheaters. Time to move on to the next thing.<p>After skill ratings, the other essential thing to stand out, is to have actual work records with ratings. I deviced a plan: Get a few very short gigs, and excel at them, to quickly fill my profile with some good ratings. After reading hundreds of insane projects, including a kid that wanted a simcity clone, to offer as a free download on his website, I found one that looked good.<p>The guy wanted to connect an HTML form with a mysql db with a simple php script. He had all the software installed. Even had a base php script. I thought &quot;wow so easy! I can make this in one or two hours as the worst possible scenario!! :)&quot;. So I contacted the guy. To my incredible surprise, the guy managed to sink me down in incredible ridiculous minutia discussion of what I was going to do. I spent five days and answered around 80 emails, discussing what I was going to do. I should have know better. But I kept telling me, &quot;well, let&#x27;s answer this, and the guy will just let me do the task.&quot;<p>Finally we agreed on doing the task. I made it in 3 hours, exactly according to the guy instructions. With the curious o desk spyware constantly taking screenshots of my desktop, and gauging my mouse movements and keypresses. After ieach screenshot, it gives you a few seconds of chance to click a button and delete it, before uploading and sending it to the client. I explained to the client, that I was including basic php security measures, as a bonus. Of which the guy had no clue. And his original form had nothing. After having the form working, I cleaned a bit the ugly graphic design, sent the stuff by mail, and went to sleep thinking &quot;well, after all the pain, I think that the guy will be impressed by the quality of the work, and dedication answering all of his concerns.&quot; I was happy.<p>In the morning , I took a coffee, and went to the computer singing a tune. &quot;Well, let&#x27;s see what the guy thinks&quot;. The agreed payment was 40$. I didn&#x27;t care about it, all I was thinking was on getting a good rating. To my incredible surprise, the guy answered with an angry rant, trowing all kind of threats and accusations, and claiming that I was trying to diddle him. The guy threatened me of giving a zero rating, and continuing the angry rant on my public profile, destroying my internet career forever. Unless we cancelled the deal, and acted as if nothing ever happened. Even told me that I should thank him, for not demanding an indemnization for his lost time. I was totally dumbfounded.<p>After some thinking, I realized that all the minutious questioning previous to the work, was a deliberated plan , to set a nest of argument traps, to later act as If he was being robbed. I was like &quot;jesuschrist, I can&#x27;t believe this. All of this tragedy just to avoid paying the pityful $40&quot;. I spent like two days lying around wanting to do nothing. Not even think. Every time that I looked at the PC, I felt like I wanted to vomit.<p>The cherry on the cake, was that a few  months later, the guy contacted me again, offering me &quot;a more challenging and involving project&quot;. Jesus! I can&#x27;t believe the kind of people that there is out there. Finally after some time, I recovered. Went back to o desk and managed some success. After some years of working at other places, I can say that there are much better places to be.",1386325139

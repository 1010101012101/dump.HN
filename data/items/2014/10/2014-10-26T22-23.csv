‪#‎NoNetTax‬
In its latest and most aggressive crackdown on our fundamental democratic rights and freedoms, the Hungarian Government has introduced a new measure to tax use of the internet--one of the last remaining platforms for independent media, information and communications in Hungary.
The move is part of the Orban government&#x27;s increasingly repressive efforts to control and punish independent media and civil society watchdog groups through both legal and economic means. It follows a wave of alarming anti-democratic measures by Orban that is pushing Hungary even further adrift from Europe. These include a recent advertising tax on media companies aimed at punishing critical outlets and a series of police raids and investigations by Hungarian tax authorities into freedom of expression NGOs that serve an essential role in promoting democratic discourse and debate.
Orban&#x27;s new tax on internet is direct attack on our freedom of expression rights and our right to access information--and risks disconnecting Hungary with global information and communication channels. The measure would impede equal access to the internet--deepening the digital divide between Hungary&#x27;s lower economic groups--and limiting internet access for cash-poor schools and universities. It would also cripple Hungarian small businesses and their right to compete EU&#x27;s the single common digital market.
As citizens of the European and global community, we defend our fundamental right to freedom of expression and information, as guaranteed to all citizens under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the EU Charter of Fundamental Human Rights.
We oppose the Hungarian Government&#x27;s attempt to strip us of these fundamental rights, which is in violation of the set of international treaties and obligations that Hungary is legally bound to uphold.
We urge members of the global human rights and internet community to join us in protesting the Hungarian Government&#x27;s proposed tax on the internet and to defend internet freedom and democracy--in Hungary and around the world.<p>Here is how you can help:

Twitter: @NoNetTax_HU<p>Additional Background and Information
Hungary’s government to introduce an unprecedented internet tax:
Hungary’s government is planning to cut off the population from the Internet to further it’s grip on the media landscape via an aggressive idiosyncratic data volume based Internet tax
A charge of 150 HUF/GB (ca. 0.50 EUR, 0.60 USD) will be levied by the government. Early estimates place the total burden of the Internet tax above 200Bn HUF (65M EUR, 83M USD) annually.
The population will not be able to use the Internet to access non-government controlled media, and be thus obstructed from the last remaining independent sources of information.
The tax undermines technological development and will create a major hurdle for businesses to operate.
In less than 48 hours 200K Facebook users signed up to the to the protest page and 30K citizens Rsvp-ing to the demonstration to be held in front of the ministry of finance, at Nador sq on Sunday, 6pm CET.<p>Mr. Orban’s government wants to distract the population from the rampant corruption, failing policies, and series of international scandals by creating an outrageous tax on Internet usage. Besides diverting attention, the Orban regime’s objective is to extend its control over the media landscape in Hungary. Having enacted a highly restrictive media law, fostered an atmosphere of self-censorship among journalist, created murky media ownership structure among other means of media control; they are now switching off the Internet. Activist and protest organizer Balazs Gulyas says: “The tax is really scary, it throws us back 30 years. I think a lot of businesses will have to move”.
Mr Orban’s regime says the internet tax is to designed to increase fairness, as people increasingly use online services for telephony and text messaging; the tax the government says is to promote fairness will in fact have a chilling effect on access to information online and further cut off the public from free and impartial information, in the latest example of a tightening political and media climate in Hungary.
In a totally new twist on preventing access, fiscal means are used over the technical approach used in Iran or China. His aim is to control information flows to Hungarians - to block access to global communications. This is the next logical step for Mr Orban, having dismantled the cornerstones of a democratic, pluralistic society step by step over the last 5 years. His declared aim is to move Hungary away from the family of democratic, liberal societies and make it look like Putin’s Russia. Access to information and communication is a keynote of open and democratic societies; the attempt to created closed systems are the soviet-style authoritarian counterparts.
We invite members of the global human rights and internet freedom community to join us in protesting the Hungarian government’s latest and most aggressive moves to crack down on our fundamental democratic rights.",1414363801

A caller&#x27;s telephone number and line type are captured by ANI service even if caller ID blocking is activated.&quot;</i>[1]<p>Even if ANI doesn&#x27;t exist on calls from, for example, an Indian call center to the U.S., the connection information must exist at some level.<p>Regardless of how difficult it might be to prosecute overseas scammers, surely the phone companies could offer a service where if I pressed &quot;*SCAM&quot; on my keypad during a phone call to mark it as a scammer, and 10 other people did the same, that incoming number could be blocked, no?<p>The only way I see that not working is if the foreign phone company is not sending the originating phone number when completing a connection to the U.S. In other words, the Indian phone company is behaving like a NAT and all phone calls from India look identical to the U.S. phone company.<p>[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_number_identification",1414363641

This means most have around 10 years of industry experience before getting funded, on average. YC would skew a lot younger (it probably shouldn&#x27;t, but it does).<p>Second is the &quot;first time&quot; myth. If you look at successful entrepreneurs, even those who appear to be hits with their first company - you&#x27;ll find that they all have at least <i>some</i> experience with delivering a product that people used before their big hit. It is a big leap to go from just having ideas and reading articles to actually building a product to completion, find even a hundred people to use it and then running through a few user feedback based iterations.<p>The same startup lore that mythologizes young first time founders usually also always mention a previous product from the founders that had some success (blue boxes, facesmash, altair basic, etc.)<p>The data shows that entrepreneurs have product or industry experience and <i>aren&#x27;t</i> in their early 20s. You can fill that time in with your own products and aim to work on the basics such as getting a product built and launched, listening to users, etc. If you can&#x27;t do it at a 100 user, $10k scale the chances of you being able to do it at a million/million scale are likely slim.<p>There is also no reason why the 100/$10k startup can&#x27;t scale up to a million/million startup - you just need to put a price on the product or your time from day 1 (product scales better) and grow steadily. But it is also good to know when an idea has reached its limits and you should exit, investing your time in taking the next idea to x.<p>For some entrepreneurs they&#x27;ll be comfortable spending that pre-time before the &quot;big swing&quot; idea in other startups (and perhaps failing) or small-scale products, or alternatively 4-5 years in industry.<p>[0] <a href=""http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/04/how-old-are-silicon-valleys-top-founders-heres-the-data/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/04/how-old-are-silicon-valleys-top...</a>",1414363534

8512809,comment,8511570,8512626,0,0,Xcelerate,,,"This is an interesting point, and brings up a kind of weird philosophical issue I&#x27;ve often wondered about.<p>Suppose that genetically, someone is predisposed to have very high motivation and discipline.  Born into whatever environment, they have the aptitude to improving their life.  Now imagine someone who, genetically, is predisposed to very low motivation and discipline.  Born into a poor, or low-class environment, they are going to have a hard time moving up.  However, someone with little natural discipline born into a high-class environment may still do okay in life (not great), by sheer virtue of the fact that they were born into fortunate circumstances.<p>Similarly, what if we find that most criminal behaviors have a genetic component?  What distinguishes mental illness from &quot;evil&quot;?  A serial killer is clearly not right in the head; do we lock them up or treat it as an illness?  Is the distinction simply based on the whims of the majority at a particular point in history?  (Note the history of homosexuality.)<p>A lot of times, people will complain about &quot;lazy, uneducated people&quot; and that if they&#x27;d just work harder, there wouldn&#x27;t be any problems, but that&#x27;s easy to say when you have an innate ability to work hard.  (Ignoring, of course, all variables other than &quot;hard work&quot;.)<p>In another vein, it&#x27;s easy to be a good, moral person if being a good, moral person is easy.  That&#x27;s a tautology, but I think it really highlights my point.  Similarly, losing weight is easy for some people but much harder for others.  Everyone projects their natural aptitudes and weaknesses on everyone else, and then makes political decisions on the basis of that projection.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t know what the correct answer is.

I&#x27;m not going to invest because by the time the KS ends and development completes I won&#x27;t have a perceived need for your product. So, what I really needed was to come across your KS page when my wife was 3-4 months pregnant. Yet, as a would-be first time parent I really had no idea what I would or wouldn&#x27;t want/need. And after the first child, I&#x27;m not feeling the pressure to get and use such an app without a specific concern (e.g. a genetic condition or predisposition to watch out for). There&#x27;s definitely more fear with the first child.<p>So, for a KS, your paying audience is a couple (or person) that is 3-4 months pregnant with their first child. That&#x27;s a <i>very</i> limited audience.<p>Now, the audience for the app itself is potentially very large. I remember that <i>after</i> my daughter was born going online to find all sorts of information and apps for all sorts of things related to her early days.<p>My gut says this is just an app that would be much better off ignoring crowdfunding all together. Just make it, list it, and market it. It has a lot of potential.

I might have a NAS, but defiantly don&#x27;t have petabytes of data, but on average 1TB to 1.5TB on my NAS. I&#x27;d be happy to pay $2-4 more dollars more if I could include my NAS... this is my thinking out loud, I haven&#x27;t run any numbers.",1414360961

The PPA manages the licensing of Taxi and Limo services in Philadelphia, but, outside of the county, it&#x27;s all the PA Department of Transportation.  Pennsylvania constables can work in any area of Pennsylvania once certified, but not in Philadelphia.<p>Am I surprised by this?  Not in the least.  It&#x27;s possible that Uber got an ok by PennDOT and thought that it would be good throughout the state...or, this might be the PPA throwing their weight behind their revenue protection.  Regardless by which one it is, I would hope that Uber will protect the drivers who took their advice (then again, independent contractors and the like) and drove.<p>*edit:  grammar/spelling.",1414360855

In our datacenter for our particular application we just choose not to.  We shut down the storage pod, calmly swap any drives that failed, then boot it back up.  The pod is &quot;offline&quot; for about 12 minutes or there about.  The RAID sync then happens as the pod is live and the pod can be actively servicing requests (like restoring customer files) while the RAID sync occurs.",1414360847

Opportunistic SPDY connections to HTTP servers rely entirely on SSL ""next protocol negotiation"" (NPN); a SPDY server will indicate that it supports SPDY to an HTTPS client via NPN.

It may even be the case that an equivalent job doesn't exist nearby and the employee is SOL if forced to quit without planning.  Furthermore, once the company fires all the blonde haired people and this becomes known, there will be cases where competing jobs can now offer less pay because it knows a competitor is no longer willing to hire blond haired people.<p>Now, you might say ""the company that fires all the blond haired people will eventually die at the hands of a company that gains an advantage by accepting blond haired people.""

Trying to fire someone in Europe is often compared to adopting a child, lawyers will take cases against former employers on commission because the probability of winning the case is extremely high. There is no comparison when it comes to US at-will employment, for eg. you have to be able to prove that the employee you fired for coming drunk to work was really drunk, that you gave him written warnings, flowed the formal procedure etc. To be fair tough, employers often use employment agencies that exploit loopholes but it only serves to increase the cost of labor. The only ones benefiting from these laws are the public sector and government owned company employees (ironically even government owned companies resort to exploiting loopholes because even they can't operate under the regulation). And these are probably much higher percentage of workforce than in the US.<p>And the corruption he is talking about is tax evasion and gray market, that's a huge part of the economy in these countries.<p>Also, I'm thinking the ""progressive tax"" in the US kicks in at a much higher nominal amount then Hungary, and that it's disproportionate to the cost of living difference.",1325924957

So instead of taking such extreme positions on this why don't we come to our senses and all agree that protections need to be scaled back but not gotten rid of. You wouldn't tell a convenience store they now have to find a new way of doing things because they can't stop the shoplifters.<p>If copyright is gone then <i>everything</i> is up for grabs and it can have unintended consequences that make the same people who were against it cry out for help. Right now the argument is framed in such a way that it only takes consumers and <i>willing</i> creators into account. There are people who create things that neither want to profit from them nor share them with the world. In a world without copyright you place much more of a burden on those people to lock away their work. Your diary is up for grabs in this type of world and if ever someone felt like publishing it as their own or selling it there'd be nothing you could do about it. That tutorial you wrote on your blog, the one that's free to access to anyone, well that just ended up in an O'Reilly book without credit and no one asked you. Sure, they won't make a killing off it in this world but it's pissing you off and you think ""that's just not right"".<p>I'm wondering if all these great ideals the anti-copyright proponents talk about are the true goal or if there's a little bit of jealousy, sour grapes, and inferiority complexes thrown in there. It kind of reminds me of the guy who works at the McDonalds drive thru who talks a lot of shit about rich people and how it's not fair and we need to spread the wealth while he just sits in his drive through hoping his bank account will fill up with piles of cash one day.<p>What is under copyright protection right now that we can't create around or over or through? Do we really <i>need</i> to base our work off of someone else's to make something better? Doesnt the greatest disruption come about as a result of inconvenient restriction?<p>Abolishing copyright sounds great and the ideals around it are just beautiful but the world isn't an ideal place and great ideals and philosophies don't really lend themselves all too well to reality when put into practice. So in the meantime why don't we jump back to reality and get SOPA voted down, lobby to <i>scale back</i> copyright instead of throwing the baby out with the bath water and generally just be more realistice about these things.",1325923743

Tell me how this sort of policy can increase a new startups short-term cash flow?  You can't exactly advertize superior working conditions (Google w/ free food/massages/nerf guns/paid child-related leave) since you do not have any track-record of being the hot new startup.  Even if you did have the best working conditions available having to pay out for an employee who is not producing anything would probably kill the startup.<p>Culture/location/talent/vc $ is what makes a company though and to some extent trumps unfavorable tax/labor laws, this is IMO why SV & California have most of the startups as compared to Arizona/Texas or why Scandinavia>Eastern Europe.",1325923439

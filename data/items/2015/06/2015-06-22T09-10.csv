When we started, Slack wasn&#x27;t so cool and only last 2-3 months people started to ask us &quot;how you differ from Slack?&quot;.<p>We created the high-performance platform that could deliver messages at worst networks fast. We can handle the good amount of simultaneous connections at once (sorry no numbers) and deliver messages at very high rate. We don&#x27;t solve any specific problem; this is just good messaging platform that works on Android, iOS, and Web. Platform means that we can easily integrate, customize systems.<p>For now we burn all our money (~100k$), and we are even not started to sell something. We are tech guys, and we can&#x27;t do sales for now and we don&#x27;t have money for this. This strategy is my (as CEO) huge mistake, of course.<p>We think that we can:
1) Raise more money. But without any traction? We have just good dev team in Russia (and we want to leave this country).
2) Fire all team and start selling by founders and make some basic traction.
3) Wait for luck.<p>All this cases seems to be unreal; no one gives us money for now, and I can&#x27;t give something to investors. It is hard to sale in our domestic market because of business culture and current economic situation (during winter we lose 50% of our money just because of currency exchange rate changing).<p>What can we do in this situation?<p>P.S.: Right now we are preparing our sources to release, and they will be available in a week or two.<p>P.S.S.: Anyone can join experimental chat by opening URL: https://quit.email/join/a8086c23dbaf9f0f7c5003844774e61dfef6d571dd37baa0c28d48fe5012171a",1434966648
9757242,comment,9756213,9756213,0,0,netcan,,,"I think the whole thing is very difficult to deal with while it is all criminalized and taboo, in the dark and so shameful. &quot;It&quot; can mean sex in general, not just prostitution.<p>I heard recently that prostitution in &quot;the west&quot; has gone off a cliff over the last few generations. Recreational sex, including homosexuality and other stigmatized tastes became a more normal part of our culture and demand for prostitution declined.  We stopped demonizing extramarital sex (or women, really) and the &quot;problem&quot; got a lot smaller. Thousands of years and thousands of cultures and god-knows how many gods worth of banning, ostracizing, preaching and tut-tutting about prostitution or promiscuity and the one thing that actually made a dent makes a difference is getting sluttier as a culture.<p>I think this is a metaphor for (or a specific instance of) a bigger principle.<p><i>an example</i><p>I was at university when grameen bank won a nobel prize for micro-lending. This was around the same time many governments and regulators (in a bunch of places) were trying to pressure  out &quot;predatory lending practices.&quot; Normal banks got out of the high risk, small loan business. They had a reputation to maintain and $400 loans to the broke and unemployed is not particularly lucrative anyway.<p>The market was left to &quot;payday loan&quot; shops who tended to be a lot shadier. Then the financial crisis happened and business boomed. If  payday loan shops get banned (as some want), the market will almost certainly be reborn as loan sharking, a traditionally criminal trade. The deeper the taboos & bans, the worse it will get. The actual thing won&#x27;t go away though. Taboos, laws or fiery political rhetoric can&#x27;t make it go away. The harder these things squeeze, the worse it will get.   Terry Pratchett would have been the person to describe but alas…<p>This is all quite ironic considering that a nobel prize was won by a bank basically doing payday loans, but with a totally different attitude. Ironic, but informative.  Grameen bank has high interest rate and uses social pressure tactics to improve repayment rates, practices considered unethical in the larger financial world. Practices shared with others in this &quot;sector&quot; of small high risk loans to the people no &quot;real&quot; lender would bother with. The practices seem to be part and parcel of the market.<p>But, Grameen bank is not like loan sharks or payday loan shops at all, culturally. Their impact on their customers and their relationship with them (and society) is far more positive. So is their impact. They won the <i>nobel peace prize.</i>! The people working at grameen bank think and act completely different than the culture of the payday loan industry. Perception matters. It shapes the thing. The perception of the employees, society, etc. are all interlinked.<p>Criminalize an industry and it becomes more criminal (with violence, abuse and all the other things that go with criminality). Label someone a pariah and they will act like one.<p>Banning, or even stigmatizing payday loans doesn&#x27;t make the industry go away, it just makes it uglier. Give it a nobel peace prize, and they become humanitarians. I&#x27;m simplifying, I know. But, I think this is a decent low resolution description of the concept.<p>It works the same way with drugs. Same with prostitution. The public perception of prostitutes, johns, madams and pimps. The taboos and laws, the disdain and ostracization. I think these things are a big part of why it is all so dark. Society tells us that it&#x27;s dark. That might keep some people away, but if it doesn&#x27;t… The johns walk into it knowing they are doing something bad and act like it. The pimps act like pimps with the characteristic dehumanization of prostitutes and the prostitutes, knowing that they are the lowest of the low.. they act like it. Suicide, depression, drug abuse and general self abuse and self hate.",1434966640

9757218,comment,9756213,9757158,0,0,erikb,,,"I agree with that rape itself is natural. And there are many instances in which even consenting sex is more exciting because it contains rape fantasies like calling the other one nasty names, hurting each other, bondage games etc. Stories like 50 shades of grey show that it is not just a male instinct to rape but also a female instead to be conquered. Power and sex are hard to separate.<p>Education and empathy is a really strong step to fight rape, I also believe that. I remember to have been reading that seeing and understanding another person&#x27;s pain can result in us having the same emotional reaction as when experiencing the pain ourselves. Therefore increasing empathy might make the experience of raping someone as unpleasent to the rapist as for the victim.<p>I don&#x27;t believe in that we are able to stop trafficking people, drugs, or anything else. When there&#x27;s demand there are people who want to deliver. But it&#x27;s true, when there are two impossible task at hand, which could you choose?

If you go out and buy a brand new VW Golf VII, insure it fully, and regularly drive this stretch, you&#x27;re probably going to experience an average cost of 247 € for this stretch.<p>But there&#x27;s two problems with this:<p>The actual marginal cost of the trip is still 25.4 €, plus let&#x27;s give it a generous maintenance cost putting it at around 50 €. That&#x27;s still less than half of the cost of the ICE. Add to this that you now have a car which can carry five people and the costs don&#x27;t increase at all per person. A trip with 5 people is still going to cost you that 500 € instead of 615 €.<p>The second problem is that this is when you&#x27;re buying a new car.

It focuses on slavery where most of the evil aspects of humans tend to come out, as in order to reduce a human person into something that can be traded, everything that gives that person a social context must be torn down. This is where the &quot;break down&quot; period comes from and it&#x27;s a common theme in everything from the African slave trade to forced labor camps. Slaves are broken down, displaced, and controlled in order to place them outside the social economics shared by everyone else.<p>The second story is one about social stigma. We live in a society which views sex trade to be worse than going into a life of crime. From a social standpoint, it means that providing a sexual service in return for money is worse than breaking the law and social order that society is built on.<p>The third, although one which often is used as an introduction, is one about poverty. In order to get food on the table people will agree to many kinds of dangerous, dirty, and unwanted lines of work. People have entered the death sentence called a coal mine, gone into work which has a life expectancy of months, but in contrast to prostitution those are often viewed as sacrifices rather than something shameful.

Can I not brute force people&#x27;s private keys by taking millions of common passwords¹ and generating public keys from them, and then seeing which ones match my friends?<p>Am I wrong? Doesn&#x27;t this seem much easier to brute force than a RSA key?

Let&#x27;s try here.<p>(By the way, one reason we ask people to send moderation questions to hn@ycombinator.com is that then we&#x27;re sure to see them. We can&#x27;t possibly read every post to the site. We miss most of them, in fact.)<p>The story fell off the front page because of a moderator penalty, though user flags caused the fall to be more dramatic.<p>We&#x27;re not trying to suppress surveillance stories [1]. We&#x27;re trying to balance it so the major ones get attention but the me-toos don&#x27;t crowd out other things. A moderator thought this was a me-too rather than a major. I might have made the opposite call, but it was probably a borderline case. For one thing, the article was shorter, and that&#x27;s usually but not always correlated with lesser substance. Since we can&#x27;t come close to reading everything, we&#x27;re forced to rely on such heuristics. They&#x27;re miserable, but they mostly work.<p>We moderate this way not because of personal opinion (I&#x27;m personally more inclined the other way, for what that&#x27;s worth), but because if we didn&#x27;t, the site would skew heavily toward these stories and there would be many more complaints (remember &quot;Why has Hacker News turned into NSA News&quot;?) than there currently are. The HN community is in disagreement here. Our job is to mediate that. Which of course is impossible. So we try to fail less badly.<p>We&#x27;re open to suggestions about how to get the balance better. We do need to balance it somehow. The idea that votes can just determine everything—without irrevocably changing the character of the site—is sadly, utterly wrong.<p>Some of the most vocal feedback we&#x27;re getting on the surveillance stories is from people who seem only to care about this one issue and would happily have it dominate HN. That feedback isn&#x27;t so helpful, because it&#x27;s at odds with what this site is. But if those of you who follow this issue closely would help us make better editorial distinctions between the major stories and the pilers-on, we&#x27;d be grateful.

I suspect it will continue to require a complex set of regulations.  I&#x27;m quite happy to see states in America experimenting with various policies towards marijuana.  Hopefully one of them will land on something not worse than what&#x27;s happening right now.  Hopefully too, the attitudes of the WHO will encourage even more experimentation.",1405818285

One is that the thermostat is actually flawed in that a single sampling point in one arbitrary location doesn&#x27;t make much sense (full disclosure: I am biased as a founder at a smart vent company), but two, and more importantly, it doesn&#x27;t have enough radios.<p>Apple&#x27;s HomeKit, also getting started in the thermostat space is too early to really get a sense for the kinds of integrations and system topology that we might expect to see.<p>SmartThings (competing with Revolve and a few others - including my open source platform <a href=""https://github.com/dandroid88/webmote"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dandroid88/webmote</a>, j/k :p) is poised to glue the IoT together within the home and it seems like at 200 Million Samsung is getting a steal.  Especially given that Nest  was 3.2 Billion...  I remember reading that Nest is/was (?) moving 100,000 units a month not too long ago, I don&#x27;t know if smart things is anywhere near this number, but with Samsung backing it, it could be a real contender and fast.<p>One can&#x27;t help but wonder where Cisco (Linksys from time to time) and others who have had a hub (complete with web server and embedded linux distro capable hardware...) in every living room for the last 10 years have been, and why they couldn&#x27;t see how good of a position they could have been in today...",1405818045

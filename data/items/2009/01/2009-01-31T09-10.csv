459417,comment,459393,459409,0,0,jmdev,,,"Exactly. The company needs to be a start-up where the founder will create the device mainly for himself - as his dream device. That's where it starts....<p>I still think there's a huge revolution coming to consumer devices. Right now, everyone's focusing on phones - namely iPhone killers and they will fail, because the answer is different - and part of the business problem is having such a unique brand that might stand up against apple and that you can build on top of it - when you see people with their Macs open and see the glowing Apple logo - this is a powerful indicator and there has to me something more to this, new, powerful and very unique...and new technologies such as flexible OLEDS etc can be building blocks..<p>Good thing is to start with a niche target (say 1 million target users) If the new start-up focuses on creating a super hackers device - now they would be on to something...",1233393611

Apple is the result of a unique combination of circumstances: a CEO who is both terrifyingly effective and also has a great sense of design.  There are very few people with both those qualities.  Even if boards of existing companies consciously tried to pick CEOs with design sense, they wouldn't be able to, because you can't recognize it unless you have it.  So the only way you could get another CEO like Steve Jobs would be the way he himself got the job: by founding the company.",1233393101

459407,comment,458825,458825,0,0,pseingatl,,,"I think it makes a difference if you want to learn a language like Russian, in which there is a great wealth of written material, or Arabic, where there is not. For Russian, you have to bite the bullet and learn the alphabet. However, for Arabic (and Persian) another alternative has grown up in the past year: Arabizi. Arabizi is the use of the Roman alphabet plus four numbers to transcribe Arabic. It grew out of the need to send SMS messages on mobile phones. It is read left to right, not right to left. Moreover, everyone can read it. This means that if you need to write a street address, you can write it in Arabizi and a cab driver can read it. You can memorize vocabulary as you work on your spoken fluency in the language. A friend of mine told me that Greek kids are using the Roman alphabet to send SMS's as well. Eventually, you can work on the traditional alphabet, but for the beginner seeking to learn Arabic, Arabizi is the way to go.",1233392738

2713813,comment,2713330,2713330,1,0,apinstein,,,"I can't find the article right now, but there have been studies about and there is evidence for that many people will do something for free, but if offered to be paid a market rate that is low for the same work, will <i>not</i> do it. In fact, they'll be insulted by the low value ascribed to it.<p>Personally I would feel like an a-hole offering someone minimum wage to do intern-level work at our startup. Nor would I want it on my resume that I worked as a web developer for $8/hour. They do <i>not</i> want a market price that low on their skills. They'd rather have a free internship on paper.<p>That said, it does all depend on context. In fact during high school I worked in a bio lab for free for about 50 hours and then asked for a paid internship (which was minimum wage) during the summer. However I was a high-schooler, so this was cool. But I would not have taken (and in fact turned down) low-paying jobs after college. So I can see that context does matter, and I don't think it's fair to rip on all unpaid internships with the same stroke.",1309438715

You would need both parties to agree to work within a closed system of modules at the outset.  Otherwise, you are right back to where we are today â€“ everything is composed more or less ad hoc.<p>At the end of the day, contracts will always need interpretation.  Contracts are simply a manifestation (in whatever form) of what two or more people expect to happen.<p>A purely top-down, closed-system approach will fail to cover all situations.  Likewise, a bottom-up, arbitrary system will not lend itself to systemization.<p>Interestingly, this dynamic is quite old in the law.  There are two major types of legal system: civil and common.  Civil is a top-down system where a code of laws tries to anticipate every eventuality.  Common is a bottom-up system where individual cases set precedent by analogy to future situations.<p>In practice, both systems tend toward the middle.  Civil law systems still require judges to interpret specific application of the laws.  Common law systems still require codified rules to maintain credibility/consistency.",1309438627

For example, many European countries have political parties that are directly descended from the fascist political parties of the 20th century (e.g. [1]). They retain their objetives, ideals and often even their signature salute. There are several politicians in government right now that I personally dislike and that I describe as fascist because that's exactly what they are.

2713777,comment,2709769,2713426,1,0,Evgeny,,,"It is virtually impossible to design a convincing study on the effect of FoodstuffA on human health. The ideal study would look something like that:\n- Enlist people into study, divide them randomly into two groups\n- Design a diet, where everything will be exactly the same, except FoodstuffA for group 1 will be replaced with some FoodstuffB for group 2.\n- Keep all subjects under supervision 24/7 to eliminate possible cheating\n- Continue the study long enough to determine long term effects (years? decades?)<p>Even in this case, there will be opportunity for speculation. Maybe the FoodstuffA is not bad, but the FoodstuffB is just beneficial, maybe we should have used FoodstuffC.<p>So, there's two alternatives that are realistic:<p>1. Observational study. Ask 1000000 people about how much red meat they eat, compare health, do conclusions. Lots of confounding variables - smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption etc etc.\n2. Randomised controlled study.

It has many features and most are very intricate, and it's very easy to get stuck for several evenings on something that experienced C++ users wouldn't even recognize as a stumbling block. 'Modern' C++ is full of template use, very hard to read libraries so it's hard to learn from them, and the quality of information online varies widely. I agree with the above poster that it would take 2 years of full time using C++ to consider one self an 'experienced' C++ programmer.<p>That said, I still think the Stroustrup is the first book anyone learning C++ should read, although that's not a popular opinion (actually I think one should start with the K&R but I consider C prerequisite knowledge). Then Koenig & Moo, Alexandrescu, then the Meyers & Lippman series. While reading these one should do the exercises and parallel with that implement a real project.<p>The above plan is completely unrealistic though, so i guess learning C++ like everybody else (being thrown into a project and sink or swim) is the more realistic route :)",1309438134

Just as having low taxes and few public services intellectually makes more sense but in reality reduces the quality of life in society, so it is with having a minimum wage. Compare the US and counties like Sweden for evidence.<p>You assume that the minimum wage is there to protect incompetent people but the reality is that when you treat someone badly like that, day in and day out, it destroys their self-esteem. You sound like you have grown up in a high self-esteem environment and probably can't relate to the poor mentality. It is a trap, it is created by the environment people grow up in and changing is difficult. For evidence, try changing your mentality and see how easy you find it. Most people tend to stay in one place in terms of their mindset for their whole lives, whether they are rich or poor.<p>If you honestly think that being paid a wage so low that you don't have enough money to bring yourself out of poverty is better than being unemployed, I have trouble not calling you delusional. Why should anyone have to work two or three jobs just to (barely) survive? How is this better than welfare for those who can't and a wage which results in living above the poverty line for those who can? How can you not understand that this would greatly increase crime? Think about it, imagine it - you're unemployed and have an opportunity to work 16 hours a day and you'll still starve or you could start selling drugs or robbing people or swindling money, which would give you enough to live on.<p>Honestly, your whole attitude reeks of ignorance.

Serfdom involves effectively permanent, near total servitude to a landowner for most aspects of life. You don't travel. You don't get educated. You don't have upside. You can't escape. You're screwed. An unpaid internship is not at all like this. Unpaid internships are not ""essentially a form of serfdom"".</i><p>No, but that's how serfdom <i>started</i> - through voluntary servitude.<p>The point isn't to equate 21st century Europe or US with pre-19th century Russia. The point is that serfdom is a form of voluntary servitude which people entered into out of desperation. Likewise, nobody works for free (outside of charitable work) unless they are desperate (or they are rich kids, and don't need to care). Companies exploit this through unpaid internships - assuming they can get away with it.<p>Saying ""you're free to walk away"" is not a moral argument; if the only way a young person can find work is through doing voluntary servitude then they are stuck in that position until they do so.<p>Minimum wage laws exist for a number of reasons.

2713658,comment,2713330,2713495,48,0,cturner,,,"There's a temptation in politics to see patterns and then fit language to it that kind of fits. It's important not to do this, because it ruins the sense of scale. For example, when someone describes a politician they don't like as a ""fascist"" it's disrespectful to the memory of people who are squashed under tanks and who are taken in the night by state agents, raped and murdered.<p>Along these lines, it doesn't fit to equate unpaid internships to serfdom. Serfdom involves effectively permanent, near total servitude to a landowner for most aspects of life. You don't travel. You don't get educated. You don't have upside. You can't escape. You're screwed. An unpaid internship is not at all like this. Unpaid internships are not ""essentially a form of serfdom"".<p>If your labour has value then you can find work that pays you a rate for it (except for minimum wage - more about this shortly). You have the opportunity to expose yourself to experience by doing internships. If you don't have anything better to be doing, then it's a win-win situation for you and the person you're doing internship.<p>When I was young I worked in a computer assembly shop for basically no money. In the course of this work I plugged a power cable into a motherboard and fried it. I probably rubbed customers up the wrong way, and certainly did dumb things. My labour was worth less than nothing, and I was lucky to have the opportunity to be allowed near the place or customers.<p>As I became valuable I struck a private agreement with the owner and spent a summer working full-time, for which I was paid one gravis ultrasound ACE. I think I ended up better on the deal than the owner, but it was a close-run thing.<p>Another time I was contracted to do a job for an oil company. It took me a month to do something that would now take me a day, and the end result was so bad that they got no return on investment of the the AUD 300 they paid me for the job. Note that in the case of the oil company work, I already had most of a computer science degree, and so was more qualified than the average kind of person who lives on minimum wage and still near-worthless.<p>After spending some time working to build up my skills, I'm now happy with my career. I wouldn't be here except for working in situations where I was earning less than minimum wage, often with people giving my low money on the offchance I might not be incompetent.<p>The minimum wage is a horrible stain on a free society. It traps people with low skills out of work and cements them into an underclass that's much more difficult to break out of. It prevents business that are operating on the edge from continuing to operate. It's a classic example of do-gooders riding in and creating damage.<p>There is an argument in favour of minimum wage, and it's this: some people are too incompetent to be capable of standing up for themselves, and these people would be easy to take advantage of for malicious bosses, of which there are no shortage. The minimum wage is a blunt force mechanism that aims (and fails) to protect this set of people. The reason it fails is that in protecting low-wage employed people, it locks out people who are in a worse situation - unempployed.<p>It's a ridiculous solution that hurts the people it claims to represent. There are much better avenues that would be cheaper and have more positive effect on people: basic risk, valuation and business skills being taught in early high-school, television campaigns that encourage people to think about how their labour is used, what they could do to make themselves marketable. Mechanisms to get people speaking English more effectively. Lower taxation. Effective technical colleges.<p>The minimum wage system is a mechanism designed by the elite to allow that elite to paper over things and sleep at night pretending they're doing the right thing. It hurts the people it claims to protect.",1309435831

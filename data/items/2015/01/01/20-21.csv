8824263,comment,8823760,8823964,0,0,tzs,,,"> Target and all of the other high profile retailers that were credit-card hacked -- they were all allegedly PCI compliant, yet it still didn&#x27;t do much good.<p>How do you conclude that it didn&#x27;t do much good? The Target breach involved installing malware on the point-of-sale terminals to grab the data as the customer was paying.<p>As far as I know, the attackers didn&#x27;t get to the stored credit card data. I suspect that they didn&#x27;t get to that data in large part because Target was mostly in PCI compliance, meaning that the stored data was encrypted, on database servers isolated from the databases not involved in payment processing, on separate networks with strong access restrictions.<p>If Target had been treating PCI the way OP&#x27;s competitor is, the Target breach could have been much much much worse.<p>> But I am debating the ethics of reporting a competitor for an activity that is NOT illegal, nor is it directly harming your customers or your business.<p>For a small business that is doing its own credit card storage, PCI compliance costs can be significant. They can easily double or triple the number of boxes you need at the data center.<p>The competitor is saving a lot of money by completely ignoring credit card security, which gives him an unfair advantage over OP. I&#x27;d consider that sufficient harm to OP to justify taking action.",1420145573

I think we all have to deal with feelings of jealousy or inadequacy from time to time.  I would imagine it tends to be worse among people in the tech world since the industry is so competitive and the bar is so high.<p>I think there&#x27;s also somewhat of a culture in tech of treating &quot;smart&quot; people like they&#x27;re somehow innately different than &quot;non-smart&quot; people or that it&#x27;s hard for a &quot;non-smart&quot; person to become a &quot;smart&quot; person.  You could also substitute the word &quot;smart&quot; for &quot;successful&quot; in the previous sentence.  Some people might disagree with this assessment, but I&#x27;m fairly confident that it&#x27;s a wide-spread phenomenon.<p>I think a culture like that would tend to exaggerate feelings of jealousy and such.  If one person is made to feel like they can&#x27;t possibly achieve the same things as another, or if they suspect they&#x27;re being denied opportunities on account of another person&#x27;s opinion of them, that would breed resentment and jealousy.  I&#x27;m not sure if that dynamic is at play in your life, but it&#x27;s worth stating all the same.<p>Anyhow, I wish you luck in dealing with those feelings.  I know how crippling they can be.",1420145454

Economic factors: The salary man is slowly going away and so are the institutions that revolve around him such as mainstream Japan&#x27;s definition of a family.<p>2. The younger generation wants more freedom from a patriarchal society; in particular women. On a whole younger Japanese women are not content with being trapped as a housewife. (It doesn&#x27;t help that women older than 25 are derogatorily referred to as &#x27;Christmas cake&#x27;, something past its due date of 12/25 that no one wants.) Younger males are also no longer content with being trapped as a corporate slave who lives mainly for his corporation and functions mainly as an ATM for his family that he rarely sees.<p>3. Xenophobia: Even though the younger generation is more tolerant, on a whole Japan is a racist country. For example, unless you have Japanese ancestry it is near impossible to get Japanese citizenship. This has larger consequences such as really low immigration numbers and generally, non-existent integration of immigrants into mainstream society (yes there are always exceptions depending on which part of Japan we are talking about). In Japan&#x27;s defense most of Asia is also racist, but Japan just takes it to another level.",1420145214

8824225,comment,8822705,8824070,0,0,thoughtpolice,,,"Yes, I suppose my larger point was more to illustrate that nothing is free. GHC is software like any other piece of software and it has a lot of competing constraints we must balance.<p>If the cost of supporting reusable IRs like you want is high in terms of LOC and needed changes, but the amount of people who will leverage that work is incredibly small, it&#x27;s honestly not clear to me if making that change and maintaining it is sensible or worthwhile. It might be worth it purely from a code cleanliness standpoint if it did a lot of cleanup, but that&#x27;s not immediately clear either. We have to maintain everything people submit to us, presumably forever - the barrier to entry for large changes should be high, and well-motivated.<p>It is similar with external core; it was several extra thousands of lines of code throughout the compiler that was rarely - if ever - used by anyone. Did a few people use it to do cool work - for example, by writing the Intel Research Haskell compiler? Absolutely, and Intel&#x27;s results were incredible - but that does not mean it&#x27;s worth keeping that ball of code around for that one use case.<p>I&#x27;d actually argue keeping it for that one case would be a terrible decision for everyone, and when I deleted that part of the compiler, Intel&#x27;s compiler lingered in my mind, as it was a user. But the fact is nobody was maintaining, submitting patches or using it in a modern GHC, including them - so I rm -rf&#x27;d it.<p>GHC is a research compiler, but it is also a production compiler for many users, and a project several dozen of us work on.<p>So while I&#x27;m sure your work is incredibly interesting (most of our large features come from people doing interesting research, so I understand your plight!), this really doesn&#x27;t mean large, sweeping changes on our part - for your one case - are very worthwhile at all for us. But maybe you don&#x27;t need sweeping changes, either!<p>(Of course, it&#x27;s impossible to say how many people <i>did not</i> use GHC because of these constraints that otherwise were unsuitable for their projects - but we have to draw a line somewhere and balance our own needs vs those of others.)<p>> Just a well-documented API would be nice.<p>To be clear - what API are you exactly envisioning? An API that makes it easy to construct Core or STG programs using GHC&#x27;s ASTs, and then feed them through the rest of the compiler? Or an API to do things like construct and manipulate the same core representation GHC uses, to later do whatever you want with perhaps with a separate tool?<p>It sounds like this is something you could tackle with a library that wrapped the GHC API. The problem is the Core representation in GHC is very prone to change, so I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s any sane way to really maintain things like API stability between versions. But you also might not need that - just a simple API around &quot;GHC Core version X.Y.Z&quot; to build programs may be enough.<p>We could distribute such a library with GHC, but this sounds like something easily doable out-of-band first, at least.<p>Either way, something like thisI can surely see the need for. Where it should live is a different question.<p>> I also agree that typing is extremely useful. But for small research projects, it can get in the way of the actual goal.<p>Yes, but again, GHC&#x27;s internal needs and developer needs outweigh those of random small research projects that might use it - the fact that it makes some kinds of work slightly harder is unfortunate, but in the grand scheme of things, this isn&#x27;t really a concern at all for any of us, and likely never will be. There&#x27;s no free lunch, I&#x27;m afraid.",1420144832

My childhood best friend is someone I met in two successive summer science programs (1968 and 1969) for gifted students arranged by our public school district. He was a very devout follower of a very evangelical denomination, certainly one of the most devout Christians in our school. (I was a church-going Christian child when I met him, and rather devout myself, but he helped me turn it up to eleven in being dedicated to what I was learning in church and Sunday school.)<p>He has pursued a very successful career as an electrical engineer in safety-critical industries such as aviation and medical device manufacturing. I actually skewed my studies to doing formal church work, missing out on a lot of the hard science courses my friend took during his university and postgraduate studies. Along the way, we each had to individually discover that the &quot;creation science&quot; we heard about in church has no firm scientific basis, and these days when I see friends here on Hacker News posting from a background similar to the background I grew up with, I gently remind them to refer to the multiple lines of evidence for macroevolution[1] so that at least we have common ground here on Hacker News to discuss biomedical research and other aspects of biological science. &quot;Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution,&quot;[2] so it is very regrettable when we have discussions here without checking the facts about evolution first.<p>AFTER EDIT: Huh, I see I am still in my edit time limit here as I expand this comment to note that there is evidently strong disagreement with my comment here. Because there is a lack of replies here, I don&#x27;t know what prompts the disagreement. I hope there is no disagreement here that the great weight of scientific evidence shows that biological evolution is a true phenomenon,[3] and I hope that everyone participating here is aware that not everyone receives factually correct information about evolution.[4]<p>Feel free to let me know what you really think about what I have written in this comment. I can&#x27;t learn from you if you won&#x27;t speak up. Speaking up with evidence is the way to convince thoughtful people that your ideas are correct.

It&#x27;s mature, reliable, and really easy to work with. The Java code is extremely easy to read (especially compared to MRI), and integrating Java libraries with your Ruby code is trivial - you don&#x27;t even have to write bindings, you just require a jar and then start referencing constants.<p>This <i>really</i> shines in places where CRuby has lagged behind - places like numeric computing and natural language processing. The library support is iffy at best, and usually the answer is &quot;use python&quot;, but when you can just drop in a Java library and call it a day, stuff gets really fun.<p>Profiling a live JRuby app with JMX and jvisualvm is <i>amazing</i> - I can attach to a live, remote production instance and perform heap dumps, start sample profiling, or even execute Ruby code! Going to back to fix our MRI apps has left me very discontent with the state equivalent tooling :)<p>My primary complaint with Java is that it&#x27;s verbose and lends itself to overcomplex design, but I absolutely <i>love</i> that I can write high-performance code in Java and then write all my business logic in Ruby - it&#x27;s the best of both worlds. To illustrate, I wrote Manticore (<a href=""https://github.com/cheald/manticore"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cheald/manticore</a>) to solve my persistent discontent with the state of HTTP clients in Ruby; the Apache Commons HTTP components are extremely comprehensive, fast, powerful, etc, but the API is horrific. I spent a bit of time wrapping them up in a nice idiomatic Ruby interface, and ended up with an HTTP client that destroys the pure Ruby clients for features and performance, and even beats out even Typhoeus (which is really just a set of libcurl bindings) - and all in only 700 lines of code!<p>Finally, the JRuby community is <i>so</i> welcoming and inclusive. #jruby on Freenode is populated with all the project core members, and they are very willing to answer questions and help out. headius (Charles Nutter) has turned around bugfixes for issues in <i>minutes</i> (in addition to being extremely friendly and helpful), and they as a group have made it very easy for me to contribute to the project.

This makes agencies that violate the rights of citizens on the Internet seem like the good guys in the minds of many.<p>> it would be pretty embarrassing if it turns out that they&#x27;re wrong.<p>No, it won&#x27;t, because they&#x27;ll always have plausible deniability in the form of &quot;we have access to information that you don&#x27;t&quot;; whether they actually do or not is immaterial.

This is not an improvement.<p><i>That you would include this barb in your comment shows that you&#x27;re more arguing against the concept of changing standards, and not against Common Core itself.

The education establishment has a long history of revolutionary change, and knows exactly how to go about it.  This always turns out badly.  The much safer way to go is to incrementally improve, with constant feedback and repetition.  It doesn&#x27;t feel day by day like progress, but it has much higher odds of actually succeeding.<p>What our educational system has done is the equivalent of throwing out a major software system, and rolling out a new one.

His customers are probably running their business, not monitoring the news for info on every SaaS they use. PCI compliance most likely isn&#x27;t what keeps them there: it&#x27;s friction in leaving, customer service, possibly features they don&#x27;t find elsewhere. There isn&#x27;t some PCI police that has a list of all their customers and will email them.<p>If customers are lost, it&#x27;ll be a trickle. Once they identify what&#x27;s up, they&#x27;ll be all hands on deck to fix it, and this amazing competitive advantage you feel fell into your lap will disappear. On the other hand, maybe he&#x27;ll ignore it - I promise you there will be customers that really don&#x27;t care. Yeah, they should. But they won&#x27;t. Your competitor will still be in business<p>I&#x27;d turn it into a marketing advantage, not treat it like a magic torpedo. Many of our competitors outsource their programming or are resellers of one of our competitor&#x27;s services. (In our industry, whoever has your data has a list of your customers, so important to control who has access to that information) In our pitch, I tell them to ask whoever they do business with, even if it isn&#x27;t us, if they outsource their operation and who controls the data. In your situation, point out that some companies in your space, without naming names, store their payment data incorrectly, and why that&#x27;s bad. Then hit them with how you are PCI compliant.<p>Another thing to consider: if your magic torpedo scenario doesn&#x27;t play out, then what? There&#x27;s people out there using a provider that stores payment details insecurely. Announce it publicly, and you&#x27;ve just made them a target for a breach - big payday for those hackers. Muahahahah, I&#x27;ve killed my competitor! Maybe, maybe not, but you&#x27;ve also just screwed over those customers. Even if they leave that provider, when they find out the reason their credit card is being abused is due to your disclosure, there&#x27;s 0 chance you&#x27;ll their business, and it could have long term PR repercussions. Hell, depending on your jurisdiction, potential legal ones.<p>(Yes, everyone will say it&#x27;s not altron&#x27;s fault - it&#x27;s his competitor&#x27;s. It&#x27;s both at that point.

If you&#x27;re already certified, nothing changes today - but when you do your annual re-certification, you&#x27;ll need to use the 3.0 forms (and not the 2.0 ones). Until such point, you&#x27;re still certified and compliant. If you&#x27;re not yet already certified, you&#x27;ll need to use the 3.0 forms; this is what most people are referring to.<p>With that in mind, this discussion only applies (right now) to sites who have never yet filled out a PCI form. For sites which have, it only applies when their annual re-certification comes up.<p>So for those sites which have to certify against 3.0, can they run on a PAAS and take payments? It depends, specifically on how the credit card number is entered. The general rule of thumb is that if the form in which the number is entered is delivered by the host (the PAAS), you&#x27;ll have to use SAQ A-EP (which is extensive, and you don&#x27;t want). if the form is delivered by the vendor (like Stripe) and injected into the page, you can still use SAQ A (which is small, and what you want).<p>How about Stripe? I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;ve released a PCI 3.0 version of Stripe.js yet, although they clearly will. Likewise, I&#x27;m not sure about the others, but I think it&#x27;s safe to assume that they&#x27;ll release versions similarly (the techniques to do this are well-known).<p>Lastly, I&#x27;m not a QSA, and this isn&#x27;t advice.",1420143671

It would print the whole board state after each move and read coords from stdin to know what square was picked.<p>I wanted to make it a proper GUI-style board with arrow key movement, randomised mines (the assignment tasked us with reading mine locations from stdin at the start), auto-expanding zeros, varying board sizes...so I did.<p>However, I knew the assignment would be marked on automated test results. I wanted to show off, but still pass the auto-tests. So I made it ask for game &quot;mode&quot; at the start, implementing both the requested behavior and my desired behavior. But if stdin wasn&#x27;t a tty, it just did the requested behaviour without asking, thus foiling the tests.",1420143198

Go looks like a hammer when the network looks like a nail. For example, Go was one of the first to start adding HTTP2 support.

The (lack of) prevalence of rape is not just a result of the technical possibility and the efficiency of law enforcement. Most people don&#x27;t want to do it, just like most people don&#x27;t want to be terrorists, and like at least <i>some</i> people genuinely don&#x27;t want to spy on others (which is hard to believe for some I know).<p>[0] that is, our individual choices - since individuals are the only place where things like norms, laws, societies, nations and even technology <i>actually</i> exist, as fragments that together with other fragments in other actually existing people form shape the emergent patterns and behaviours (in the context of technology: hardly anyone, if anyone, understands everything involved in making a CPU, and that involves medicine and food and infrastructure for the workers required, I really mean <i>everything</i>, which for even things much simpler than a CPU is a lot).<p>To consider technology or other things actual agents is just false IMHO, technology doesn&#x27;t do anything, and it can be pretty much be forgotten within one generation.

Often it&#x27;s that in the modern ones the music is playing over the voice, the female voice often attempts to sound &quot;cooler&quot; to the point of the actor doing the sync almost sounding like speaking with the closed mouth and therefore being hard to understand. At the same time, the male voices sound a little clearer to me but also significantly worse than in the old movies. In the old movies, the actors tended to be clear like in the theater.",1447581143

Most of the time it is about finding out what the right thing is and then doing it and explaining it well.<p>I think the reason why it often isn&#x27;t done like that is twofold. First, there are many incompetent, sloppy developers who just don&#x27;t care. Second, users are unwilling to pay for the time it takes a competent, unsloppy developer to do the work properly.<p>For instance, it is not impossible to design an address entry form that accepts unusual but correct addresses and at the same time captures as much structure as possible. Not impossible, but surprisingly difficult if you think about it.<p>You would think that it&#x27;s economic rationality that leads to sloppy design and hence to the need for free form text fields. Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t make sense to design everything with great care?

The latter in particular are interested in RHEL after some poor experience using Windows on warships and similar.<p>But at the same time there is a pile of MSCEs running around in these organizations, and so there is a incentive to make daily Linux management at least superficially similar to reduce retraining costs.",1447578638

10569000,comment,10567408,10567742,0,0,sparkie,,,"Kernel is ideal for creating small embedded languages, where you can selectively expose parts of the parent language to perform general purpose computation, without giving any access to sensitive code.<p>Kernel is like Scheme, except environments are first class objects which you can mutate and pass around. A typical use for such environment is for the second argument of <i>$remote-eval</i>, to limit the bindings available to the evaluator. If you treat an eDSL as a set of symbols representing it&#x27;s vocabulary and grammar, then you bind them to a new environment with <i>$bindings-environment</i>, then passing a piece of code X to eval with this resulting argument as the second environment, will ensure X can only access those bindings (and built-in symbols which result from parsing Kernel, such as numbers), and nothing else.<p>There&#x27;s a function <i>make-kernel-standard-environment</i> for easy self-hosting.<p>Trivial examples:<p><pre><code>    ($define! x 1)\n    ($remote-eval (+ x 2) (make-kernel-standard-environment))\n    > error: unbound symbol: x\n\n    ($define! y 2)\n    ($remote-eval (+ x y) (make-environment ($bindings->environment (x 1))\n                                            (make-kernel-standard-environment)))\n    > error: unbound symbol: y\n\n    ($remote-eval (+ x y) ($bindings->environment (x 1) (y 2) (+ +)))\n    > 3\n\n    ($define! x 1)\n    ($define! y 2)\n    ($remote-eval (+ x y) (get-current-environment))\n    > 3\n</code></pre>\n<i>$remote-eval</i> is a helper function in the standard library which evaluates the second argument in the dynamic environment to get the target environment, then evaluates the first argument in that. The purpose of this is to provide a blank static-environment for o to be evaulated, so no bindings from the current static environment where <i>$remote-eval</i> is called from are made accessible to the first argument.<p><pre><code>   ($define! $remote-eval ($vau (o e) d (eval o (eval e d))))\n</code></pre>\nIf you&#x27;re familiar with Scheme, you may notice the absensce of quote.<p>And contrary to the opinions in the article, Kernel is the most expressively powerful language I know, and I&#x27;d recommend everyone learn it. You have a powerful but small and simple core language, from which you can derive your DSLs with as little or much power as you want them to have.",1447578292

It works in places where mobile connectivity infrastructure <i>already exists</i>, just (presumably) not affordable enough. It is purely an economic arbitrage game, not infrastructure development.<p>EDIT2: I also speculate that competition between big players (e.g. Google vs Facebook) will not help resolve the problem either. Since all incumbents benefit from stuff like this, and almost all newcomers lose, big guys have few incentives to break down such paradigms after they are built up (very much like gerrymandering that Democrats and Republicans both like as it benefits them all).",1447578133

Innovators solution. &quot;Be patient for growth not for profit&quot; which isn&#x27;t necessarily wrong but Facebook proves that wrong.<p>While I do agree with you that his theories break down after the first book, Facebook was delivering healthy profits pretty soon after IPO. They could have made profit far earlier, but their investors chose to roll that profit back into the business and make a big bet on mobile. That bet paid off and hugely increased the available equity value and allowed them to go on an acquisition spree and diversify into other growth categories.<p>Facebook is also a unique business in this context because it didn&#x27;t really disrupt an established market. They were just first to reach scale in an emerging product category with strong network effects. But there was no product that consumers were over / under served by. You could say advertising, but their real innovation was on the consumer side: you don&#x27;t get to show lots of ads until you have lots of traffic first, and Facebook&#x27;s traffic and content acquisition strategy were novel at the time.",1449093592

It makes sense that companies aware of it would take steps to prevent it, such as those suggested by Christensen, e.g. a separate organization with limited budget (so small opportunities are attractive to them), One can also aggressively buy up potential competitors - perhaps explaining recent apparently ridiculously overpriced acquisitions.<p>e.g. Intel&#x27;s Andy Grove had a blurb on the cover of the Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma, and Intel has certainly <i>tried</i> to combat ARM with ATOM. At least, they didn&#x27;t lose the laptop market. Similarly, MS acted aggressively to curtail netbooks. (Through chromebooks have had some success.) Neither have had success with smartphones - but smartphones/tablets also don&#x27;t seem to have had any success at all in invading laptop/PC territory, despite being more than powerful enough.<p>BTW: having read Christensen&#x27;s first three books, I feel that he became solipsistic and over-abstact, and tried to make disruption a business theory-of-everything; coinciding with his move from academic to consultant. It amounted to: people buy what they want/need, and when that changes, a different business organization may be more suitable to serve it (accounting for things like improving different attributes; faster release cycles; different business models etc). Did it seem like this to anyone else?<p>I preferred his early PhD work, and e.g. his graph showing that market supply for improvements increases more quickly than market demand for improvements (so is eventually over-served, and customers shift focus to other attributes).

10666087,comment,10656987,10656987,0,0,dkbrk,,,"There are plenty of entirely worthwhile and interesting areas of research in philosophy. This is not one of them.<p>It is entirely sufficient to understand that brains are composed of physical elements - neurons and the like, that communicate with each other with little electrical and chemical signals, and that this physical state evolves forwards with time according to physical laws. I repeat, this is all that is required to resolve <i>every single one</i> of these supposed &quot;problems&quot; of consciousness.<p>We may not understand how a brain works in its entirety, but knowing that its behaviour is entirely described by these physical pieces bounds our understanding of its behaviour as a whole sufficiently that these problems are trivially revealed to be specious nonsense.<p>As an analogy, I know that the microchip in my computer is built out of transistors etched onto a silicon die. I have some knowledge about microchip design, broadly speaking, and I know about things such as logic circuits, latches and clock signals, but I don&#x27;t possess a complete understanding of how it functions. Still, knowing that it&#x27;s just transistors bounds my understanding of its behaviour. I know, for instance, that there&#x27;s no extra-physical magic pixie that makes it function. I don&#x27;t wonder about the subjective experience of the floating point unit, or about whether the L1 cache is <i>feeling</i> or just <i>registering</i> the data it stores, or whether it would be <i>possible</i> or just <i>concievable</i> for a world to exist where an atom-for-atom identical processor didn&#x27;t actually <i>compute</i> but just went through the motions of moving about some little electrical impulses.<p>On a fundamental level, our brains are very much the same. The architecture is nothing at all alike, for example: the clock speeds and signal propagation rates are much lower, synaptic signals are at least partly analog, the brain doesn&#x27;t have anything remotely close to a uniform memory space, and it continuously dynamically reconfigures itself through neuroplasticity. None of this is relevant. I did not conclude there is not a magic pixie making making my computer&#x27;s CPU function because of my understanding of it&#x27;s architecture and overall design, I concluded it because I know it&#x27;s made up of transistors, and it&#x27;s behaviour is entirely described by its transistors, and no matter how hard you try you can&#x27;t make a magic pixie out of transistors.<p>We have established that brains are made up of little physical pieces and obey physical laws. It trivially follows that every piece of data that could possible be referred to as part of our consciousness, every &quot;feeling&quot; or &quot;subjective experience&quot; is just some pattern or another entirely described by the physical state of the brain.<p>If you see some sort of problem with this, if you see some sort of contradiction in the understanding that &quot;you&quot; are just a wetware-implemented algorithm that is the end result of a rather convoluted process of natural evolution and human development, that is a problem with your understanding not with reality. There is no space in this picture for looking at some pattern of neural impulses and asking whether it <i>feels</i>; you can answer that question however you like, but with respect to reality that question is not even wrong.<p>David Chalmers would call this &quot;materialism&quot; or perhaps &quot;physicalism&quot;. Once you move past Solipsism and decide that reality actually exists, or that we don&#x27;t know that reality actually exists but it seems to so we might as well assume it does for the sake of argument, then, though this is actually a tautology, every physical thing physically exists. The problem with words such as &quot;materialism&quot; and &quot;physicalism&quot; is that using the word implies things could be any other way. There are abstract ideas, and there is reality - &quot;that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn&#x27;t go away&quot;. While I might respect a position such as solipsism as epistemologically valid, beyond that particular loophole I cannot understand why philosophers who do not agree with what is generally called &quot;empirical materialism&quot; are taken seriously.",1449092867

Direct democracy is closer to communism than any of the attempts (by nation states) that have been given its name. In the age of the Internet, direct democracy is easier than ever to organise. Effectively, you need two things:<p>1. An inclusive, informative news media.<p>2. A way to collect votes.<p>Are two things above hard to achieve? Depends on who you ask, but I&#x27;d say they were more than achievable.<p>How does direct democracy pave the way for communism? Firstly, it begins the process of breaking down the power structures that currently exist, and provides an alternative means of organising society that can fill the power vacuum. Secondly, it gets people used to the balance between the individual and the collective. We can achieve great things when we work together, but that should not come through forceful means, the rights of the individual to choose their own path should still be valued.<p>Thoughts?",1449092494

And by exotic I mean a language that stands out from the imperative or object-oriented crowd.<p>I like how Clojure challenges established paradigms with a surprisingly mature ecosystem.<p>Being a hosted language on the JVM has its pros and cons, but the cleverness and pragmatism of Rich Hickey (creator of Clojure) really stands out. He decided to go with an industry strong, battle-tested environment, effectively standing on the shoulders of giants, while providing a lot of fresh ideas.<p>Also, the fact of being a Lisp can be seen from different angles: for some it&#x27;s lots of weirdly nested parentheses, for others it has a beautifully simple, yet extremely powerful and expressive syntax.<p>But don&#x27;t let those aspects fool you. Once you scratch a little bit the surface, you will see the extraordinary power of its persistent data structures. For those who don&#x27;t know what persistent data structures are: in Clojure, oversimplifying, there is no mutation to data structures. Every time you &quot;add&quot; or &quot;remove&quot; a key from a hash map, you are actually creating a copy of it. And in order to make this efficient, you need special data structures with &quot;superpowers&quot;, that are not actually creating a whole copy of themselves, but rather modify atomically only a part (hint: trees).<p>And having those data structures leads to the next big feature of Clojure: concurrency. Not only does Clojure provide a mechanism to dispatch thread-like constructs (core.async), but the whole language is designed around supporting concurrency.<p>I also want to add that what really surprised me about Clojure is its thriving community and smart people using it. I am pretty sure that if you want to hire great, highly motivated talent, going Clojure will help you with that.",1449092425

See eg:<p><a href=""http://blog.samaltman.com/employee-equity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.samaltman.com/employee-equity</a><p><a href=""http://blog.detour.com/introducing-progressive-equity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.detour.com/introducing-progressive-equity/</a><p>The current founder/employee divide is largely a relic of the days where, to build a tech startup, first you had to convince a bunch of investors to give you $10M and then you hired a team with that.  In that system, the founders were the ones who convinced the investors, and the employees were the ones who were hired with investor money.<p>But capital requirements for startups have gone way down since then.  Now, the logical divide is before vs. after product/market fit.  If you join BPMF, you&#x27;re a founder - sometimes (oftentimes?) the title and equity don&#x27;t go along with that, but that&#x27;s because there are a lot of suckers out there who don&#x27;t actually know how the startup game works.  If you join APMF, you&#x27;re an employee.  After all, a founder&#x27;s entire job is to identify an unmet need in the marketplace and devise a strategy for solving it, and until you get PMF you haven&#x27;t really done that.<p>The complication is that <i>startups BPMF shouldn&#x27;t be hiring at all</i>, but few of them realize that, and even fewer of them can check their egos enough to realize that having people do your bidding won&#x27;t actually help you find a viable business model faster, it just makes pivoting more difficult.

The stick model will have bits sticking out.<p>However when you get 30 people working together to make a big model, the clay model is going to start looking very strange indeed. Different people will have different finger pressure and shape the clay differently. Some people will make more right angled parts with the clay which will clash with the parts of the clay that are carefully smoothed out. Someone might spend a week fixing a perfect parabola for a curve at the top of the model just for someone else to bend it off to the side with an ugly twist to fit with the other side of the model.<p>30 people on the stick model? Not really a problem. All the sticks look the same. Anybody who needs to attach one side of the stick model to something else just needs to grab a stick and tie it on. You won&#x27;t see a perfect stick parabola, but then you also won&#x27;t be stuck with a strangely twisted piece of clay.<p>You can always create a style guide for using the clay - always keep between a 30 and 60 degree angle on joins. Apply one finger of pressure when doing joins. And so on. Sometimes this works with very diligent reviews that keep everything in place, but as soon as a crisis comes up or the model needs to pivot urgently? Everyone rushes to touch up the model in the quickest way possible and your model starts to get a bit thinner on one side than the other, etc.<p>So there&#x27;s nothing wrong with choosing a great clay model that fits well into your hand and you can shape effortlessly - but you need to remember that sometimes the &#x27;painfulness&#x27; of using a model made out of sticks can be a big blessing when you&#x27;re trying to massage a bit of clay that someone else pressed a bit too firmly on.<p>EDIT:<p>Also, when you&#x27;ve been making and using models for awhile, the stick models get an added benefit: you can browse through the stick models really fast based on only their outline and be able to understand very quickly how they work. Pretty clear why: the rigid sticks form a very distinct outline (think interfaces and forced directory structure in Java). Being a stick model expert therefore has very good job mobility and high demand.<p>Each clay model is generally more unique and requires some study to understand even if it does look nicer.",1449091404

It sucks. There&#x27;s a reason there are hundreds of food delivery startups every year: the only people with the ability to start companies don&#x27;t have enough experience with the world to know what would even make a good company. Sometimes they stumble onto something wonderful, but most of the time they just fail, go live with their parents for a few months, then go start up something else. Repeat until they get tired and just get a 9-5 job at Google or Facebook.<p>Every individual has a market value. If I make $200k/yr right now, and I get an offer to work for a startup where I would make $100k/yr, how is it fair that someone who previously made $75k/yr gets the same amount of equity as me? After all, I&#x27;m giving up $100k/yr just to work here! It&#x27;s better to ask someone &quot;what would it take to get you to work here?&quot; and pay them that.

And that could be accurate. Put each of them in 1000 identical situations, and the more experienced one will close more deals but not 100x deals, probably.<p>However, that&#x27;s not the real world. In the real world, the salesperson with 24 years of experience has contacts and relationships that, to your point, will help them land more lucrative deals. So, yeah, they might not close 100x the number of deals, but they could easily close deals worth 100x to their business.<p>Or to frame it in software development, if you give the same exact task to a developer with 12 weeks of experience and one with 24 years of experience, the more experienced one probably won&#x27;t finish it 100x faster. However, if you&#x27;re giving them the same tasks, that&#x27;s a gross misuse of skills. The more experienced one might architect the system so that task naturally falls out of the design or knows of an open source tool that can handle it with no custom development or maybe they understand the business well enough to propose a simple tweak to business processes to obviate the need to do the task at all – that is, they might bring 100x value overall.<p>My point is just that, sure, there are diminishing returns on experience solving the exact same problem, but a person with 500 hours of experience and on with 50k hours of experience shouldn&#x27;t be working on the exact same problems.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like that old question when looking at a résumé: Do they have 10 years of experience or 1 year of experience repeated 10 times?",1449091133

It is currently approximately where it was 23 years ago.  This is a pretty common usage.  If a stock trades up and down all day and ends where it started, you will hear people say &#x27;it ended the day unchanged&#x27;.  Or &#x27;unch&#x27;.  Sea levels in the Marshall Islands are currently &#x27;unch&#x27;.  Over a period of 23 years.<p>And make no mistake, I acknowledge the worldwide trend in sea level is upwards, the evidence of one tidal gauge doesn&#x27;t trump the evidence of thousands of tidal gauges.  And it has been upwards of course this entire interglacial.<p>Now, your example of a linear trend superimposed on a sinusoid is a good one.  So let me say this, it&#x27;s a pretty fucking pathetic linear trend if, 23 years later, the bottom of the sinusoid is still overlapping the starting point. The noise in the measurement, and the seasonality, is greater than the supposed trend.  It&#x27;s worth considering for example the coastline of Manhattan 100 years ago.  This trend you speak of is utterly insignificant on a human timescale. We can literally grow land faster should we so desire.  For example, consider the fact that many Pacific islands are growing due to sediment accumulation (<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10222679"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10222679</a>), so weak is this trend.

In fact, all you&#x27;ve done is insist that the end goal of Communism has not been achieved.<p>That a leaderless society has not yet been created in the name of Communism isn&#x27;t relevant to what has resulted from historical attempts to create such. It matters not one whit to the question of what all previous attempt to achieve such a goal have produced.<p>Is your goal of a leaderless society with shared means of production achievable? I don&#x27;t know. I do know that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth killing another thirty million people for the sake of another attempt at finding out. History strongly suggests that that is a significantly more likely outcome of an attempt than the creation of a stable leaderless society with shared means of production.<p>It&#x27;s in no way relevant that (Russia|China|North Korea|Cuba) are not or have ever been genuinely Communist in an idealist sense.

This is significant because it calls into question the plausibility and achieveability of any kind of transition to Communism. This in turn suggests that Communism cannot ever be evaluated because it is not achieveable by means we consider acceptable. Thus, the initial question of &quot;Has Communism been attempted and failed, where Communism is defined in a textbook manner and the transition to it ignored?&quot; is rendered null and void.<p>In other words, if you can&#x27;t find unicorns, it might be time to reconsider the policy of virgin human sacrifice in order to search for unicorns.",1449090500

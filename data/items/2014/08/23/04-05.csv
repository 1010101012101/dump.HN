8215011,comment,8212340,8214567,3,0,vacri,,,"If I drink a litre of water in one sitting, I feel queasy and unwell. This is &quot;the illness of a living organism&quot;. I&#x27;ve done it before on hot days - it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s hard to drink a litre, most people can do it easily. I have been poisoned by water, using that definition, but most would say that using the term that way is needlessly pedantic.<p>Are you aware that just like the body regulates sugar, it also regulates water? The body tries to maintain the right level of water, and it&#x27;s easy to show: drink a lot. In short order, you&#x27;ll be pissing a lot, to get rid of the excess water. People that have their ability to regulate water inhibited also show a lot of illnesses as a result - in terms of demographics, this can be seen in cultures where women aren&#x27;t allowed to go to the toilet during the day. Sugar doesn&#x27;t get magical, unique treatment in biology - water even has its own organ system that is primarily devoted to managing water content. And if you want to get socio-political about it (unsure why this means it&#x27;s a poison...), we&#x27;re also addicted to water and nations go to war over fresh water supplies... something that is pretty rare for corn or cane fields.<p>The point is that labeling sugar as a poison is being simplistic, and the picture is far more complex than that when discussing diet.",1408768972
8215010,comment,8212340,8214121,2,0,visarga,,,"Calorie counting is more than balancing a budget of calories over the length of a day.<p>It creates an ability to discriminate about foods and portion types - how many calories in an apple, a slice of bread, a cup of milk-coffee or a beer? I know all of these because I have slowly learned them over the course of months. It does make a change when you go shopping and when you pick the size of your portion.<p>Also, it allows for intelligent management of cravings. For example, you have 500 calories left, and it&#x27;s 16:00. You could eat a slice of pizza and that would be it. But you could also eat two slices of bread with cheese (250) and in the evening have a moderate snack of 250. You see, that&#x27;s how you can play chess with your hunger. You can plan ahead, you can use your intelligence in a domain that was governed by blind impulse before.<p>You don&#x27;t need to refrain from any type of food - you just have to couny it. Want french fries with steak while on a diet? Want some pizza? It&#x27;s ok, but it&#x27;s going to cost you. A beer (0.5l) is 180 calories - maybe some mineral water would be ok instead of the beer? But you can still have the beer, just have to eat less pizza. The fact that you can eat anything makes the regime more humane.<p>That&#x27;s just something I deduced from my own experience.<p>TL;DR In time, better tracking and better planning become internalised and when you do stop counting, you&#x27;re left with a bunch of good habits about eating that will protect you for the rest of your life.",1408768962

8214980,comment,8214438,8214887,3,0,gregd,,,"So reading these findings is kind of enlightening.  As a former Manager with the State of Oregon, the lines about competing priorities really resonates with me.  DAS (Dept. of Administrative Services) was tasked at one point with unifying IT and related services throughout the state, which basically forced them to look at the state as one entire enterprise.  Good in theory, not so good in practice.  I think what has proven to be true, is that each Agency has very different needs and wants with regards to IT and projects that fall into that realm.<p>The report goes on to mention that &quot;the project seemed to lack a consistent, cohesive <i>enterprise approach</i> to managing the project.&quot;  This sounds like DAS wrote this.  It goes on to say, &quot;The focus was on establishing an <i>enterprise solution</i> for the exchange and for the DHS Modernization project.&quot;.  Again it sounds like DAS wrote this.<p>A key component (I think) that screwed the process was not keying vendor payment to deliverables, well and paying time & materials only.  Fucking unbelievable.  If I had been involved in this project, I would have gone on record in the beginning as against this setup and I would have considered it doomed to fail.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that they put together an RFP for a Systems Integrator and during the open question process &quot;Carolyn Lawson said that she called potential system integrators and was told that they were not interested in bidding due to the lack of clear requirements and the limited budget (the state requested $96M, but was only funded $48)&quot;  So no potential bidders would bid on this fiasco.",1408767738

They just accept whatever box they are put in without even examining it closely.  Which is a big problem.  But goes back to people wanting to keep their jobs.<p>The thing is that structures of often so fucked, it literally puts people&#x27;s jobs in jeopardy in order to fix them.  For example, if a PM at one point realized that there was no actual working deliverable after X months, they probably realized it was because of some decisions a boss or another PM had made.  So in order to rectify that situation, they would need to say or do something that could potentially get that person fired, or try to convince that person, either of which would mean it was likely they themselves would be fired.<p>Basically I think that people usually don&#x27;t want to rock the boat because they are scared, and so its easy for them to say something is someone else&#x27;s problem and just keep their heads down.<p>Comes down to politics as much as actual ability or knowledge.

As I understand it, fat partitioning appears capable of change during menstruation.<p>Of course, then we run into a problem that the results may not apply to women.

8214970,comment,8212340,8212340,1,0,visarga,,,"What about calorie counting? I think the best way to lose some fat is to add up the sum of the calories of what you&#x27;re eating, as the day goes by. In time, this will create an ability to know which foods are too rich and which are ok. Also, they allow management of appetite/hunger by allocating the rest of the calories for the rest of time. I personally found it much easier to eat on a budget of 1200 or 1400 calories a day than following a regime that forbids some kinds of foods or aims to make food less palatable. I lost 30 pounds that way and was able to keep my new weight in the following 5 years. I used an iPhone App for actual counting and calorie database lookups. Also, physical activities can be tracked and added up to the daily budget. If I walk for 2 hours, then I can have an extra meal, if I want to take it.<p>TL;DR Calorie counting makes for mindful eating and changes habits, without suffering.",1408767487

If you are feeling hungry all the time, it is because you are leptin resistant. People become leptin resistant in an insulin-flooded environment. Solution: restore leptin sensitivity by stopping the flow of insulin. You stop the flow of insulin by reducing carbs (and possibly protein). You maintain leptin sensitivity using intermittent fasting (if you have iron will-power, you could use this as a starting point, but that sounds miserable to me).<p>Note that this physiological state (leptin resistance) is likely an evolutionary survival advantage as people would be insulin-flooded when eating fruit in the late summer and early fall, just as packing on weight for winter would be most advantageous. Since we never have the proverbial winter to lose the weight and restore leptin sensitivity, we are left starving and eating more all of the time.<p>People don&#x27;t get fat because they are eating too many calories.

If you watch, most of the Microsofties will use the same gestures and techniques in the presentations, too.<p>The languages listed as ""soon"" would appear to be a freeze-the-market component of the classic competitive strategy, as are the barbs tossed at the competitors.<p>Almost certainly more technical and operations and licensing complexity and cross-version complexity, though the C-level usually discovers these costs after the deal is done.  If at all.<p>Will it work?  Sure.  But you'll (still) be using Windows and Windows Networking, with all that entails.<p>But hey, they got you to look at Windows.  Again.",1225807179

Given that McCain is so far behind the mere possibility of a Bradley effect favours him. Let's say both effects are 50% likely to exist and would sway votes by enough to tip the election. Then the results would be<p>25% Bradley + No Cellphone =  McCain wins
50% Bradley + Cellphone = Obama wins
25% No Bradley + Callphone = Obama wins<p>So in this example McCain now has a 25% chance. Of course this is an exagerated example but hopefully you get the point.",1225807076

353391,comment,352323,352389,0,0,dejb,,,"I just had a look at 538 and I'd defintely put my money with betfair or intrade. There is no accounting for things like the 'Bradley effect' or other highly correlated events on 538. I'm sure many bettors do use it as a resource but their judgement is likely to be a lot more subtle and incorporate more factors than the statistical analyses provided by the site. Kind of like the way that humans are still smarter than artificial intelligence (which is currently much like statistical techniques).<p>> If I was placing any bet<p>Well you should make a fair bit of money if 538 is accurate. Betfair has had 50K available right now for Obama at 1.08 implying a 92.5% chance which looks pretty good considering 538 says it is 98.1%. If you bet 50K  you'd have a probabilistic profit of nearly 3 grand (50K * 1.08 * 98.1%). But when you actually went to put the cold hard cash down I'm sure you would have some second thoughts about 538's models. The whole point of betting markets is that talk is cheap.<p>> There's no empirical test of likeliness<p>Yes that is a problem. If betfair was (accurately) pricing in a 10% chance of a significant, accoss-the-board Bradley effect then there would be a 90% chance it would not occur and 538's results would look more accurate (across the electorates). However that 10% chance (if accurate) would be enough to make betting according to betfair's odds profitable vs 538's odds.<p>In general this is reflective of the 'Black Swan' problem of uncommon events such as a market crashes. Those that underestimate the risk can often make money for long periods of time by betting against it. But when the risk event strikes all those profits and more can be wiped out.",1225806151

If he did eat anything, would he be able to digest it without his intestinal flora, many of which are probably also extinct? Or would he simply be eaten by one of our modern predators, anything from an eagle to a bacterium?)",1225806036

I have no idea how many voting machines are at a typical US polling place, but I'm sure they can't serve nearly as many people in parallel as the Australian style little cardboard booths, where any decent-size polling place will have dozens of people voting in parallel. The bottleneck is at the place where they look up your name in a giant book (never a computer!) but I've never had to wait more than a few minutes there either.",1225805372

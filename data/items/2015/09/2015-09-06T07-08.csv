It seems to me that a better characterization would&#x27;ve been &quot;has a positive effect&quot; versus &quot;prevents a negative effect&quot;.  For an analogy, if some engineer had suggested that cockpit doors be reinforced in pre 9/11 days, that voice would&#x27;ve drowned. If an engineer went ahead and implemented it anyway, that would&#x27;ve called for an enquiry into the additional cost, instead of rewarding the discovery and address of a vulnerability before its consequences hit people.

10177042,comment,10175296,10177018,0,0,pron,,,"Oh, absolutely, but there are formal methods for working with that, too -- well, maybe just the &quot;evolving&quot; part if not the &quot;gestalt&quot; -- mostly based on temporal logic (I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m arguing on the side of formal methods now...) See, e.g. the Esterel language[1] used in the industry (directly or through its descendent languages) to write full, safety critical real-time systems. It is an imperative, non-Turing complete language, that is fully verifiable, and actually able to track an evolving gestalt for some restricted definition of &quot;gestalt&quot;. Esterel, BTW, has had much more success than Haskell in the industry.<p>Another example is TLA+, which is used by Amazon to verify their (Java, I assume) web services[2]. Unlike Esterel, TLA+ is Turing complete, and can therefore fail to prove many things. It will also take longer and longer to run the bigger the code is, and therefore only verify algorithms, not entire systems.<p>Also, see the history of Statecharts[3], a predecessor to Esterel, that was designed first and foremost to assist humans in writing specifications and only later combined with Pnueli&#x27;s temporal logic to facilitate formal methods.<p>BTW, the same David Harel who worked with Pnueli on Statecharts and temporal logic, is now involved with Behavioral Programming[4] a very interesting programming style that makes human specifications easier to translate to code.

Solomonoff induction is just a formalization used to show the result is very general.<p>Any reasonable prior should have similar cases. Unless you really believe the mugger being a matrix lord has <i>0</i> probability, or that God has <i>0</i> probability, etc, you are forced to act as if they are true. Which results in wasted effort in the vast majority of possible outcomes, in exchange for a massive payoff in incredibly rare outcomes.<p>Assigning 0 probability is not something you should do lightly. It would mean you could wake up and find yourself outside of the matrix, and you still would not believe it had any chance of  being true. It would mean God himself could come to and say &quot;yeah it&#x27;s all real.&quot; And you would be forced to believe there is still <i>0</i> probability he exists.",1441524233

They go into incredible amount of depths for a very, very niche audience: other academics interested in, e.g., the experience of women in Japanese detective novels of the 19th century.  (n.b. Actually a book, assuming I am remembering all the details correctly.  An advisor spent years on it.)<p>This is <i>exactly</i> the result the market should hope for: a profitable method which gets academics to write down very-incredibly-niche ideas and then put copies of them exactly where someone would expect to find very-incredibly-niche ideas.  The alternative to these $150 books is not $7.50 books.  It is &quot;no book.&quot;  They do not meaningfully trade off with equally-in-depth blog posts, because academics are not scored on, and hence do not as a matter of practice actually sit down and write, book-length blog posts.",1441524119

Writing large software is hard (and a software composed of multiple components is large software, even if you decide using the network stack when calling some functions is a good idea ;)). &quot;Type&quot; people (and I&#x27;m certainly for some kinds of static types, I just don&#x27;t think that they&#x27;re the solution to everything) would tell you that types help restrict your computation in such a way that reasoning about it is easier. To that I say, but I want to do something specific which it&#x27;s pretty annoying in PFP, and they answer, just do it a different way, to which I say, if I can do it differently, so can the compiler on my behalf. In short, I don&#x27;t think that explicit types (i.e. those that can be defined in the language you use) are stronger than implicit types (i.e. anything that a verifier can prove about your program), and at least in theory, they are both &quot;the same&quot; (though, see another comment here on what I think about two things being the same in a mathematical sense). We should use whatever is easier for our minds to grasp.<p>The more essential problem -- although I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s more interesting or less interesting -- is what exactly do we want to do in our programs? If we require a Turing complete model, then no matter how many types -- explicit or implicit -- we throw at the problem, we just won&#x27;t be able to formally prove properties we might care about. Some people, however, claim that we don&#x27;t really need Turing completeness, and if we don&#x27;t, that might open a whole new world of possibilities. But once we start restricting the computational model, the representation we use -- say, PFP or imperative -- might become much more important, each being able to compute things that the other cannot (we know that lambda calculus and Turing machines both compute the same functions, but once we restrict each in some arbitrary ways, it gets harder to find equivalences between restrictions in the PFP model and those in the imperative model).<p>Finally, I think that the notions of what it means &quot;to reason about&quot; or even what it means to be correct (and certainly how important it is to be correct) are themselves vague and require answers from empirical psychological/sociological/economic research than from math.",1441523833

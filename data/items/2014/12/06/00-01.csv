The issue is Docker&#x27;s process model, which is fundamental to the way it is built. Docker seems to have taken the opinion that the best way to solve the problems with their process model is not to fix it, but add more features to the kernel to force it to work. Rocket went with the fix it approach and simply started over.<p>Also, would you mind clarifying what you mean by &quot;daemonless mode&quot;?",1417827542

A copy of Vogue (est 1892) or W magazine (est. 1972) would probably have comparable images, but would probably not have been readily available at the time to the demographic doing this kind of research.<p>We should not change it for the reasons I made in several sibling comments: we lose a common point of comparison.<p>You can dilute it&#x27;s relevance by providing many alternative reference images for many algorithms and popularized those alternative reference images. No one in the field is going to complain about having more common reference images, but they sure as heck are going to see you as &quot;book burner&quot; if you trying to eliminate the one common image without first providing alternatives. Merely stating there are other lossless images is not sufficient. You need to provide those same images after having been processed with every relevant algorithm someone might need to know.<p>How about you start off by doing this work for Bellard. Take the Mozilla set, run them through BGP and send the images to Bellard for inclusion on his website. Enrich us. Don&#x27;t make us poorer.<p>> The notion that only a person from the same field can have a valid opinion on this is frankly ridiculous.

A lot of lawyers have specialisations, i.e. litigation, IP, tax, etc. Good firms have all these capabilities in house. Just like software developers, genuine good lawyers are actually hard to find<p>First, it would probably be a good idea to talk to an IP lawyer, to understand who owns what under the laws of Delaware (and the state your live in). I&#x27;m not US based, but I can imagine some states have different laws, with some having precedence over one another. It could be that you inadvertently transferred the IP to the company, by some action or event. Now you know where you&#x27;re at, which is important if you intend to continue building the product.<p>Second, and I&#x27;m not sure on this, but I would probably talk to a corporate attorney to understand what my options would be.

8707870,comment,8705186,8707300,0,0,FrobeniusTwist,,,"I hear you, but if your assessment is based on XSLT 1.0 (which is likely, since 2.0 was not very widely implemented) you might reconsider.  The differences between 1.0 and 2.0 are so stark and significant that they&#x27;re hardly comparable.  They both use the same syntax (XML-based, which is an understandable turn-off), and the processing model is essentially the same, but the inclusion of a real type system in XPath/XSLT 2.0, and some badly-needed features that needed to be kludged in 1.0 (for-each-group being the most conspicuous, IMO) makes a real difference.  I think it&#x27;s a shame that the very real limitations of XSLT 1.0 continue to be imputed to 2.0 (and the impending version 3.0), since, if you&#x27;re working with XML at all (which maybe you shouldn&#x27;t be, but that&#x27;s another issue), XSLT is a great example of Alan Kay&#x27;s requirement that &quot;simple things should be simple, and complex things should be possible.&quot;",1417826901

See what people are talking about. If a category becomes to cluttered, add a new one.<p>Don&#x27;t try to structure your forum before you have content!<p>- Ask users what they want.<p>- Define the scope of your forum.<p>What should be the primary topic people are supposed to talk about. An off-topic board is ok, but it&#x27;g good to have a general idea on what your community is supposed to look like.<p>- Sign up beta users first.<p>It&#x27;s probably a good idea to start with a small core group before launching  and inviting everyone.

The more I ignored the pain, the longer it would take to heal.<p>In my early 20&#x27;s, I suddenly took up running--eventually ratcheting up my route to 7 miles--after being somewhat sedentary for a couple years.  The result of this was perhaps the worst case of Plantar Fasciitis I&#x27;d ever developed.<p>Shortly after, I visited an expensive shoe store downtown, and explained my problem to the salesman.  He recommended a pair of high-end Asics, in the price range of $80-$120.  I believe the pair had the title &quot;gel evolution&quot; in it somewhere.  He also laced them up a special way.  Whenever I use them, I maintain this special lacing, and always have to carefully tighten them just enough so that my feet still have enough flexibility to bend my foot without constricting it or cutting of circulation.<p>These shoes provided incredible arch support, being manufactured with a great deal of material surrounding the ankle and the sole, but while also being made of flexible material in the rest of the shoe. (Note that the shoes I&#x27;d been wearing when I injured myself were incredibly cheap, and had virtually no arch support).<p>To further enhance the arch support, I also replaced the soles with some fairly thick &quot;Superfeet&quot; soles, which are rather stiff and are curved to rise where your arches are.<p>Since then, for the last 5 years, I&#x27;ve been running on a daily (or at least weekly) basis--the problem has never come back, even though I seem genetically predisposed to the syndrome.  Having excellent shoes makes all the difference.<p>Later on, I picked up a pair of Asics from Nordstrom Rack, at a great price (under $50).  These were much cheaper (instead of having &quot;Gel Evolution&quot; in the title, they were just called &quot;Oasis&quot;).  These have worked just as well for me, although I suspect that my continuing foot health can also partially be attributed to the muscle strengthening of my feet, as well as good form.  (When you are still in pain, be very careful not to continue running if you feel like you need to modify your gait in order to avoid the pain (&quot;limping&quot;).  This can result in injuring yourself in a new, different way, such as your knees!)<p>By the way, I highly recommend jogging or running, in general.  I wouldn&#x27;t be the person I am today without it, since it is often when I am outside, running, when I come up with the best ideas.  I suspect this has something to do with the time-scale of the activity (lasting long enough for sustained thought), the freedom for the mind to roam (since exercising is not mentally taxing), and not the least due to the increased oxygen in your system.  If you run often enough, you begin to become addicted, to the point where you feel &quot;high&quot;.",1417825923

There is a gap of perhaps an order of magnitude in capabilities between what we are doing and what would be possible if we gave space exploration a higher priority in terms of expenditures. But there is a gap of perhaps 1 to 2 orders of magnitude in capabilities between what NASA is doing and what would be possible if NASA manned spaceflight were run better and smarter.<p>As an example, the Shuttle program spent around $5 billion a year consistently for nearly 30 years. In that time the major achievement of all that work was to put up the ISS. The ISS is nice now that the expense to put it up is just a sunk cost, but it was in no way worth how much it cost, nor was anything the Shuttle did worth the cost of the program. Ultimately every Shuttle launch ended up costing about as much as a Saturn V launch (and that&#x27;s a Saturn V launch back at the start of the program, more likely later launches would have become cheaper due to various economies of scale and process improvements). So we had 30 years of operating a hugely expensive low Earth orbit spacecraft instead of 30 years and over 100 launches of a heavy lift rocket capable of sending payloads beyond Earth orbit. We could have had hundreds of people living and working in orbit, on the moon, or on Mars by now, but instead we got the Shuttle and ISS. Some of the fault there comes is due to congress, but there&#x27;s no excusing the people at NASA from making and committing to these decisions.",1417824723

Even stripped of the awkward, ugly, syntax, the kind of thing you want to specify in XSLT is complicated and messy.<p>&quot;Emit X when you encounter P except if the third element of type Z (if it exists) of the grandparent of P is a Q with attribute TUESDAY having value FIZBIN emit Q&#x27;s content transformed according to rule Y&quot; is never going to be pretty, and while you can argue that only badly designed document formats require things like &quot;the third element&quot; to be specified, the world we actually live in is full of such things. And because we will always re-purpose document formats to ends their designers never envisaged, it will always be the case.<p>[#] I can&#x27;t actually remember how many S&#x27;s DS*L has in it, although I once did know most of the words to the DSSSL Song.",1417824098

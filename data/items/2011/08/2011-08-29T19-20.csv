Obviously you can have bigger buttons which is always a good thing, and you allow each button to have sub-buttons which actually works out really well. I personally think Microsoft is on the right track from a high level perspective.<p>The problem comes in the implementation. The graphic design is just horrible. Where is the grid? Where is the white space? What the <i>hell</i> is that round button that replaces the file menu?

And based on my personal experience, I believe this to be the case - most people do not know what Explorer is for, let alone how to use it efficiently.<p>The reason for using the context menu use in my case is that most options are available only from the context menu...e.g. ""edit"", ""extract [from zip] all"", etc. and it is only through many years of trial and error that I have developed any efficiency with the context menu - this is because the problem with context menu operations is that they require enough experience to recognize the context and remember what [hidden] commands will be revealed by a right-click.<p>The advantage of the ribbon is that context menus are made visible when the context is entered, thus allowing less experienced users explore options more easily. Also, the issue with traditional context menus is that they are a mixture of fixed elements [cut, copy, paste, properties] and context specific items [extract all].",1314647753

Things that are rewarding, things that enhance your ability to understand a problem, things that give you new skills and abilities, great tools, or high powered technology. But, if you don't know you need it, then chances are, you don't need it.<p>On the other hand, perhaps the fact that you are asking is a sign that you are ready to need it. Are you becoming curious with how things work? Do you run up against an assembly wall when you try to debug or get tasks done? Do you need to eek out performance that you can't otherwise get? Only you can answer that question.<p>Fortunately, assembly programming will always be there for you, and learning the underlying way things work will always make you a better programmer.

My mother doesn't want to remember what mouse button to click or that CTRL or ALT is a modifier on this command.<p>I would argue that THIS is what made Apple's OS hang on all those years it was in the severe minority.  There is a segment of the population that wants only one mouse button to click, not 3, not 3 plus CTRL or ALT or etc.  Apple did end up having to rely heavily on their option key to extend functionality but at its root the UI was designed so that the average user could do things in a simple, straightforward way.  MS sees visually exposing commands to the user as their way to do it and while I may not entirely agree, I don't think it's without merit.  My kudos to them for also letting me as a ""power user"" collapse the ""newbie visual noise"" off my screen and drop what I want on a custom quick access bar.<p>Remember: don't let your status as a power user cloud your view of how your grandmother might want to use her computer.

2938589,comment,2938257,2938507,15,0,psykotic,,,"> SIMD assembly can give performance improvements of 10-20x or even higher for many types of real-world code.<p>Using SIMD intrinsics is often preferable. For set-in-stone inner loops, the extra performance you can wring out by hand-writing in assembly may be worth it, especially on compilers with shitty support for intrinsics. For SIMD-based leaf functions that are going to be inlined in many contexts, intrinsics have the advantage since the compiler can schedule and register allocate the instructions piecewise rather than treating them as an indivisible block with hard-wired registers (GCC-style clobber lists are supposed to help the compiler do that with inline assembly, but it sucks in practice).<p>My opinion is that every programmer should learn enough assembly to fluently read the code generated by their compiler, but most of them should not be writing it. Debugging is the number one pay-off, but keeping tabs on what the compiler's optimizer does with your C code is a close second.<p>There was a good illustration of this last week on Hacker News. Someone submitted a StackOverflow thread where they were competitively coding a fast fixed-size sort based on sorting networks. The tentative winner at the time was using some god awful hand-cooked branchless code for min/max that was completely defeating the compiler's attempts at generating the simple and optimal cmp r0, r1; mov r2, r1; cmovg r1, r0; cmovg r0, r2 instruction sequence. That would have instantly obvious if they had the habit of reading their compiler's assembly. The result is that they were leaving a ~3x performance gain on the floor.",1314647458

2938533,comment,2938257,2938257,4,0,idanb,,,"Definitely worth the experience, but not really too useful for most practical programming projects.  The big advantages of writing assembler come from understanding the real time nature of a processor (at least for me).  Writing code in assembler is truly an art since at that level you can actually interweave code in such a way where blocks of code are both functional in scope as well as globally (such as using a block of code as a delay for a different action, caching the result until later using it, used often in video code).  Great assembly will generally beat a compiler significantly especially on embedded systems.<p>In my experience learning assembly language is not so much an action but more of a process.  Build yourself a nice little cheapo MCU circuit (AVR, PIC, ARM) , or get your hands on an emulator, and try to actually program it using assembly language.  I'd highly recommend doing this using either a RISC instruction set over making an attempt at a CISC one like x86.  Not hating on x86, but my experiences with it did not really teach me much about computers, rather taught me about x86 (if that makes any sense).  I'm not a massive fan of how they always teach MIPS in academia, but it's a good place to start since most RISC architectures are very similar if not based on MIPS.<p>Also, understanding assembler will help you in understanding how CUDA works under the hood.  CUDA is C based, but underneath its implementing some interesting SIMD stuff, so at least a basic feel for how instructions are fed into a processor could legitimately aid in optimizing code for CUDA where a 1% difference could be very significant.",1314646735

He's comparing it to what he's used before (command line) and assuming that any new way of doing things won't need relearning, or at least that relearning should be easy because he's a ""poweruser.""<p>- Assessing a window manager in isolation from the rest of your workflow makes no sense.<p>- Based on my experience with ribbons in Office, I think they are much less user-friendly than any other existing system of accessing commands. Primarily, I think this is because of the visual noise: there are lots of icons and words in an arbitrary layout (not rows or a grid) you have to parse through to find what you want. I think the same principle applies as with web forms (<a href=""http://www.cxpartners.co.uk/cxinsights/web_forms_design_guidelines_an_eyetracking_study.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cxpartners.co.uk/cxinsights/web_forms_design_guid...</a>) -- the ribbon makes you jump around between a whole bunch of icons before you find what you want.<p>- Spending more time with ribbons don't make them easier to use in practice. For example, I use conditional formatting, autofiltering, and sheet/worksheet protection all the time in Excel. I still am not able to remember which tab they are in on the ribbon (how does putting sheet protection on ""Review"" tab make any sense?).<p>> Someone might have a better feel for temps in degrees Fahrenheit over degrees Celsius. That doesn't mean Fahrenheit is inherently better than Celsius.<p>I'd say a better analogy would be between the US system of measuring volume (gallons, etc.) and the metric system. I've refused to learn the US system because the relationship between the different units is totally arbitrary.

SIMD assembly can give performance improvements of 10-20x or even higher for many types of real-world code.  Skill at using SIMD is in incredibly high demand at the moment, especially on ARM (with NEON).  <i>If you are writing code where performance is critical, you should always consider how to optimize with SIMD.  If you don't, you're effectively throwing away >90% of the capabilities of your CPU.</i><p>4.  If you understand the capabilities of the machine you're optimizing for, you can better write code (in a low-level language like C) to take advantage of it.  Examples of this include the ability on ARM to do conditional instructions effectively for free, or the ability on x86 to do reg3 = (reg1+(reg2<<{0,1,2,3})+<const>) in one instruction.<p>Learning assembly is quite easy; for example, last Google Code-In we had a student (age 17) who started knowing not a single iota of anything about assembly and, within a week, was writing literally thousands of lines of SIMD code and passing stringent code reviews.",1314646470

Each of these is a  'modifier' that power users are used to, but which make the mental model of file manipulation much harder for beginners to wrap their heads around. They have to remember to apply these modifiers to see if the functions they want exist. Moving the functions into a contextually aware ribbon will make life much easier for these users.<p>Third, Move, Copy, Delete & Rename occupy the center of the ribbon.

So now we just stretch the definition of dirty to mean anything one can complain about at work? Then there is no point to it, by that definition there are dirty parts to every single job in the world.<p>Personally I cant think of any other job that is further from dirty then most programming jobs (literal definition). Why is that tech people have to hijack everything with the me too talk? Next we will read about strong men competitions and all the tech people will chime in with how deployment is such a heavy weight to lift... but hey its just figurative! Or how the programming is like cleaning toilets, because you have to look at other peoples code... on your monitor!<p>And if you really think your job is dirty, go find an electrician and pull wire through a steel mill, or work with a nurse, or a truck driver, go pull up well pumps, or drain septic tanks... or any other legitimately dirty job.<p>Or just stop trying to jack the little bit of pride a blue collar worker can have because he actually knows what dirty work is everyday.",1236722298

And as it has been said before, not everyone feels the same way as the OP.<p>Though a lot of users are worried about the culture on HN. Most users like this site because there is very little trolling, low noise, and informative posts. And a lot of users here consider other sites like digg and reddit to be less useful because of trolling and a high ratio of uninteresting to interesting posts. So they want HN to keep its culture and focus. That's why if a popular story is unrelated to tech or business, someone will probably complain that it doesn't belong on HN.<p>Most people who are concerned about quality on HN think growth can be ok, as long as it's slow enough that the all the new users can have time to learn the social norms of the site. And so if someone mentions it on a highly-trafficked website, some people get afraid that the user base will grow so fast that the new users won't have time to learn the social norms.Then  HN will turn into another reddit or slashdot.<p>People started worrying about the culture of HN six months after it started, so almost everyone here came in at a time older users were complaining about growth.<p>Post welcoming new users:<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=459289"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=459289</a><p>Here's a post on culture: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=465991"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=465991</a>",1236721431

I didn't mention that anything is evil, more of a ""do Amber Alerts actually work and how big of an impact do they have compared with the questions asked by this one person on HN?"" I don't really have an opinion going either way on Amber alerts at the moment, I'm just giving you the numbers...the numbers taking into account fire alarms, firefighters responding, building safety codes, lifeguards, good samaritans, and more.<p>Just because Amber alerts are one way to approach the issue of child abductions doesn't mean it's the best way, doesn't mean it necessarily works, and doesn't mean that we should just go ""oh look children are in danger you're evil if you don't support it!"". It certainly does not mean we should be ignoring other dangers as well, such as fires and drowning and car accidents and more - what are those, the top three leading causes of accidental death in children? To do so is to be grossly irresponsible.<p>Another statistic: The CDC thinks using car seats and booster seats <i>appropriately</i> could halve the number of car related injuries, fatal and nonfatal, in children in the United States. This estimated number in one year may actually be larger than the number of children safely recovered thanks to an amber alert in more than the decade that has passed since the program started.<p>Last one, I promise: I don't dispute thousands of children do go missing every day, but even NCMEC's statistics are not grim: many children who do go missing are found again (<a href=""http://www.ncmec.org/en_US/documents/Statistics.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncmec.org/en_US/documents/Statistics.pdf</a>).

Outside of this argument, I feel people misunderstand how long something takes in a computer. The relative time a network or hard drive read takes, a memory read takes, a CPU instruction cache miss takes, and a dumb comparing of bytes via a single instruction are all a <i>magnitude</i> of difference apart.<p>So let's say you're writing your http caching server and you're using the new strlen algorithm. The amount of time your code will spend fetching the item from memory and putting it on the wire will <i>completely</i> eclipse the speedup you get from this fancy strlen. Not to mention if you're writing this in a high-level language, the nanoseconds you save on a linear algorithm will simply not matter.<p>So you can make the argument that over the last few years, the total time and energy spent by all Linux machines saved by using the new algorithm is worth it. I don't exactly buy it because most of modern computers' lives are dictated by waiting for input, processing it in burst and then more waiting. Most CPUs are sitting around the world with single-digit utilization. If we all loaded up a bunch of work to do in 1990 and the world's CPU power spent time crunching it, we might arrive at an answer a few hours or days sooner. But all it means in realistic terms, is that your Linux box will arrive at answer a few nanoseconds sooner and get to finally start waiting for its next batch sooner (whether this entails serving http requests or waiting for your next key stroke)<p>I'm all for optimization, but I think it has to be appropriate and <i>measured</i>. It probably makes sense to spend time on nano-optimizations for maintainers of one of the most-used libraries in the world, but all I'm trying to say, that for most readers of HN, it's better to spend time working on algorithm run-time optimization or caching policies than looking for getting side-tracked with strlen implementations.",1236719051

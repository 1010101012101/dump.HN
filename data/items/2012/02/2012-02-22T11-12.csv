Not that I'm some anti-hipster, but I don't think it will become mainstream right away BECAUSE:<p>1) People without smart phones exist. I'm one of them.<p>2) Nobody is going to be satisfied with phone hardware to control both their phone and their sit-down setup. At least not for a few more generations of Moore's law, and Moore's laws current method for increasing power, stacking cores, is a battery vampire. People who want their phones to actually run for a non-trivial length of time will end up under-utilizing their hardware while on the go. (Hardware that they still payed money for.)<p>3) So lets say we still have the sit-down setup in the form of the base station. This brings up it's own set of questions:<p>[A] Where is data stored? What if someone steals your phone? What if you <i>don't have one</i>?<p>[B] Where does the computing power come from, is this just a shell for the phone or does it have some power on board?<p>Now we can wrangle over these questions for a while, but I'm quite confident the answers are ""The base has an internal HD"" and ""The base has computer parts inside."" at which point I have to ask; how is this <i>that</i> different from what we have now?<p>I mean, sure my desktop is a little heavier to move than a ""base"" might be. But unless this base is going to be like the old 90's laptop bases (Huge flat thing with peripherals that plugs into a smaller top.) I can't really see myself moving it. If it has a full fledged keyboard, monitor, and mouse, I can't see myself moving it. If it doesn't, then it's a laptop. With all the problems laptops entail. (Which can only be fixed by ""desktopifying"" it.)<p>Of course, marketing conquers all. That is what everyones always going after right, true marketing? Or was that true love?

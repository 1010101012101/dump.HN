Just add an interactive component and you get something out of science fiction ( Diamond Age, Neal Stephenson, 0-553-38096-6)  ~ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age</a>  <p>Another point that parallels Stephensons book is the failure of AI. If you can add digital content, hook it up to the web who needs AI?",1182509401

But it can be improved. I haven't used the the rss feed much ( <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/rss"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/rss</a> ) but doing so I found that there is a cut-off on the browser I use (Firefox = toolbars = bookmarks ) toolbar cuts the text off at 40 characters.  So If the title contains the most accurate info in the first 40 characters it even works in the RSS feeds (reader) with readers truncating the rest of the message. The other problem I noticed with the RSS feed is the transporting you to the direct link, not the news.yc feed which as the original link in the title. So rule of thumb: good title in 40 char <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/bootload/587744795/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/bootload/587744795/</a>",1182507963

Allow me to relate my situation regarding working while in college:<p>I have one particular client who relies on me greatly.  They accept the fact that school comes first and we work around that, but things have slowed down significantly while I'm in school.  I find it more draining to sit in boring classes all day than to sit at a desk working on an interesting project.  Between that, homework, and the distractions of college life, I get little consulting work done.<p>That's just me though...I flourish when at a desk with a large monitor, not sitting in my messy dorm room with a 13"" laptop.  He may be the type who can handle both an education and work, or he may be at a school that requires very little of him.  Everyone functions differently in different situations.  Bottom line?  Keep him with you with small projects, even if he is busy.  You never know when he, like myself, will have the sudden urge to take a semester off and work on a startup (and be sure to be there to take advantage this opportunity if it should come along).<p>P.S.-There's also a lot to be said for working in the same location as someone, telecommuting kills my productivity, but again, I'm not the standard for anything :)",1182507532

4082748,comment,4081846,4082309,4,0,freshhawk,,,"> Science is provisional. In my opinion we should always approach it with humility. What I am seeing more and more is people who somehow feel elevated by science to be better than their peers.<p>You seem to be making an odd distinction here. I find the idea that humans are easily fooled and one shouldn't believe things until you have evidence, rigorously checked by other people and with techniques based on hundreds of years of experience in how human beings fool themselves and get things wrong, to be very humble.<p>I don't see more and more people feeling elevated by science and becoming condescending or superior. I do see people get that way when the idea of evidence is casually dismissed because of some gut feeling. That condescending response isn't helpful and doesn't do the scientific or intellectual community any good but it's because of the incredible arrogance behind the cavalier dismissal of all that experience in searching for what's true.<p>> Science is provisional<p>That's quite the statement. Scientific findings are provisional. At this point, it's really hard to argue that science itself is. The idea that one is most likely to be right if they don't believe things without evidence and the enormous philosophical machine humanity has built that turns hard work into facts isn't provisional. It's the only thing we've ever discovered or built that works.<p>As to the simulated universe: What if the universe where the beings who simulate our universe is also simulated in another 3rd universe, and that one in a 4th universe and so on up until you get to 7. Then it stops.<p>That's just as likely as 2 nested universes or that the universe is the dream of giant inter-dimensional turtle or that your own mind is the only thing that exists and the rest of the universe is a hallucination.<p>All these things are possible, and impossible to be disproved, but even if they are true, science is still the only working method for figuring out what the rules are to the simulation/dream/hallucination. So go ahead and believe we are in the matrix, I will still have the same simulated contempt for other simulated people who decide that thousands of years of work by human beings attempting to learn about the matrix is worth the same as what they ""feel"" should be true. That's incredible arrogance.",1339131450

Its also fun to not worry about saving some pennies every month just so that you would want to buy a new phone/tablet or whatever six months later.

4082675,comment,4081846,4081846,4,0,einhverfr,,,"One of the key things that gets lost in this that the piece tends to assume that unscientific beliefs are somehow bad and we'd be better off without them.  I am not convinced that's the case.<p>There are two reasons I think so.  The first is that, as P. W. Anderson pointed out in his essay ""More is Different"" (published in Science magazine in 1972) reductionism doesn't work.  With added complexity comes fundamentally new patterns.  Just as chemistry is not just applied physics and biology is not just applied chemistry, I don't think life is just applied science and the real epistemological limits to what science can tell us are very real barriers.  Heisenberg does a great job of mapping out these problems in his look at the history of scientific thought (""Physics and Philosophy"").<p>When you look at verbomotor cultures and how they look a the world, their ideas of magic and religion aren't really filling the same roles as science today (see Ong, Walter ""Orality and Literacy"" and Eliade, Mircea, ""Myth and Reality""  See also Turner, Victor.  ""The Ritual Process"" and Grimes ed., Ronald ""Readings in Ritual Studies"").  Instead, in a culture based on spoken discourse instead of writing, everything is based on re-usable patterns that can be flexibly applied.  This is something greatly missing in religious thought today.  The mystery of a story is not whether it happened in the past but rather how it happens today.  From this perspective a story like the Fall from Eden isn't so much about the origins of sin as it is the model of leaving one's parents' house, getting married, having kids, and becoming an adult.<p>I think these sorts of patterns are likely deeply ingrained in us and it's better for us to accept and use it than fight it in the quest to conform to science.  For example, in the article, you have the idea that people naturally think of heat as a substance.  This works fine for many applications.  One can think of heat exchangers as not being fundamentally different than the system of oxygen exchange in the body or vice versa.  They do work the same way on a metaphorical level and these metaphors as Heisenberg shows (again ""Physics and Philosophy"") are also at the core of the formation of scientific theories.  I therefore wonder if we'd have any scientific progress if our scientists had no unscientific beliefs.<p>Additionally you have issues with the quest to be more scientific often eating the tail of, well, science.  For example, it is worth noting that countries in Western Europe who use midwives as the routine primary care for childbirth have better outcomes than Western European countries that do not.  Yet there is a fear that by doing this in, say, the US, we will be backing away from our commitment to science.  Why is following emperical data seen this way though?  Is it that we really worship technology in the guise of science?",1339129538

Science theories are all about proving older theories wrong, and humans naturally regard those older theories as ""intuition"".<p>I don't think it has anything to do with being naive or not. Aristotle thought that bigger object falls faster, force is required to maintain motion, and air is made with one element. These are all great discoveries that hold for over one thousand years. They are science. And I don't think they are naive at all. Aristotle is one of the most intelligent people at his time, and so is Issac Newton, Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking. Yet today we regard the views of the elites as ""truths"" and all the rest as ""naive intuition"".<p>These scientists all did the same thing: prove something wrong by discovering something that explains more things more accurately in more circumstances. The fundamental way they achieved this is empirical observations, which are simply endless. Therefore, there's nothing stopping us from proving Newton's laws or Relativity wrong.<p>The way we come up with scientific conclusions has very similar characteristics with the way we know God. In school, we can reach conclusions by drawing a graph with 7 data points and observing some linear relationship with an imaginary straight line that somehow connects them. Boom! A conclusion of ""truth"". One major difference of scientific discoveries is that they involve mathematics, which is a priori by nature, and this makes ""science"" consistent and stable.<p>It's perfectly understandable that not many people believe in evolution. It's a fact that evolution theories have more evidence than creationist beliefs, but it's never a human nature to chase the ""more evidence"". We make irrational and hence suboptimal decisions everyday, yet we humans as a whole are not necessarily disadvantaged by irrationalities. ""More evidence"" doesn't mean it's right and ""less evidence"" doesn't mean it's wrong. ""More probable"" doesn't mean it will happen, and ""less probable"" doesn't mean it won't happen. You get the idea.<p>Or is it true that elites (minority of people) have more tenancy to believe in theories with more evidence, accept explanation that covers more circumstances and do things that have more probabilities of success?

Any rationally grounded support for such a belief vanished as soon as we developed reasonable alternative and scientifically motivated theories of the mind.<p>However, for some reason my mind's stubborn refusal to let me believe in the supernatural has not eroded my sense of religious commitment. I think this is because I realized long ago that the crux, and contemporary import, of religion for me (and this is entirely my opinion, and mine alone) is not in instilling belief in any specific historical event or supernatural phenomena, but rather instilling the notion of <i>belief</i>, in the broadest sense, deep within every individual.<p>This is ultimately what differentiates humanity from all other forms of life that we know of. That is, we are conscious creatures (mostly) capable of lofty pursuits, and there is value in exploring unknown territory and working together with other human beings to achieve great things.

The defining characteristic that still makes it science is that we can predict things using mathematical equations (although not as well as we would like).<p>Which brings me to an interesting question.  If a hypothetical alien civilization develops technology using different types of math than us, different analogies than us (particles/wave, etc.), and different beliefs than us, is it still science?  I would argue yes.  If they can create sophisticated technology that is predictable, the end effect is the same that we humans have.<p>Which brings me to my last question.  Is string theory science?  Again, I would say yes.  Because although its predictions are not currently capable of being tested, they are in principle capable of being tested with more sophisticated technology.  There is a clear path to developing a test of its predictions.<p>So I think ""science"" can best be described as the pursuit of prediction.",1339128363

The web is not a crappy X server. It's a much much much superior approach to the X server- in that it allows code to run in the gui without the latency of sending every single mouse click and key press over the network, and every single low level drawing command and uncompressed pixel put back.<p>I think what you want has already been tried with Java applets. Java applets had 10 years to establish themselves as the one true way to make professional web apps and replace the OS. It was a monumental failure of epic proportions, and javascript+html won that battle a thousand times over. Now you want to try it again because .. why? Because you think it's a technically better approach. It's just history disagrees with you.<p>The web can work over a modem and crummy mobile phone connections. X would be hopelessly unusable under such conditions so it's a complete mystery to me why you are claiming that the web is a ""poor man's"" X-server. You'd have to be half mad to think that. The web could be 10 times more shitty than it is and would still beat X for quality and responsiveness. So really... HUH!? WHAT?",1339128186

On another note, I think it's generally nothing to be proud of when you ""stop reading something"", and I wish people would stop announcing it in this complaining manner--if you didn't read the article, there's not much to discuss so you might as well not make this known at all. There are lots of other informative points to be gleaned from the article if you look past these rather superficial errors.",1339128184

I know people mean well when they give that advice, but its a downright terrible advice for the vast majority of people.<p>Let me point out that this is an article written by a guy that ended up ""loving"" programming. I know that there is a lot of programmers here, (myself included) but let's face the reality here: only weirdos love programming. I say this because I'm a weirdo and I love programming, and every friend I know that loves programming is more or less the.. eccentric type. We just happen to be very fortunate in that we happen to love something that guarantees a middle class income and plenty of opportunities.<p>Most people are normal and love normal things. They like food, they like music, they like art, they like sex, they like sports, they like adventure. If you tell normal people to do what they love, you are practically dooming them to shit careers. It's all about supply and demand. Most people love the same things that other people love (except programmers, who are weirdos), and there just isn't enough jobs that normal people will love. Maybe 1% of normal people will end up in their dream job, and the other 99% end up on the hamster wheel chasing what they love.",1339128105

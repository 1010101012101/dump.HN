In recent years, prop desks have either gained (Goldman) or lost (Lehman) huge amounts of money.<p>But this isn't always true. Sometimes services are the big moneymakers. Prime brokerage (allowing hedge funds to outsource their back office) was big up until the crisis nuked many hedge funds, for example. In a good year, classical IBanking (IPOs, M&A, etc) can be big. Big banks run many desks at either a small loss or small profit just for the purpose of keeping the lights on. When the market changes and that desk becomes important, they rake it in.<p><i>Is the economy, say, twice as well off from a financial allocation standpoint compared to 25 years ago? If not, how are the trading desks pulling in twice as much money without being extractors?</i><p>They could capture a larger portion of the new value being created. Suppose they created 100 units of value in the past, and captured 25% of it. Now suppose they create an extra 50 units of value, but capture 50% of it. Before this change, the banks captured 25 units of value, the world 75 units. After, the banks capture 50 units of value, the world captures 100 units.<p>As for payday loans, they always existed to some extent (loansharks were always present, as were pawnshops), but they only got into full swing in the 90's. The internet made tracking defaulters easier, competition in electronic banking made the transfers cheaper, and the Clinton-era wave of bank deregulation eliminated many state level interest rate caps (California's was lifted in 1996, for example).",1298393911

This is in no way limited to the programming field. For example this kind of behavior frequently leads to comical nonsense in the machine shop at the local hacker garage (we have a local TechShop).<p>I've lost count of the number of times I've seen folks gravitate to the shiniest, most miserably complex high tech tools in the shop simply because they're 1. shiny, 2. high tech, 3. complex. There was a guy in last week who's working on a project he plans on patenting. I watched as he spent over an hour setting up a complex system of jigs and programming one of the CNC milling machines in the shop. Seconds after he set the thing in motion the bit managed to snag his work piece (a small bolt), snatch it out of the jig which it then promptly used to murder his jigging system. I could offer a laundry list of minor mistakes this dude made, (no cutting fluid, incorrect jig material/setup, CNC programming error) but the one big mistake is the most interesting in my mind: he picked the wrong tool for the job. A dead simple drill press and a machinist's vice would have not only been entirely sufficient to the task at hand, going ""low tech"" would have had him productively drilling parts in less than five minutes.",1298393709

The fun comes in waves, every time when you hit one of the various physical barriers (namely latency and bandwidth).<p>That is to say the host-count in isolation is not the most interesting figure. I've seen large sites run on 20 machines or on 500, depending on the skills of the management- and developer-team, and how much they care about the infrastructure cost in the big picture.<p>The host-count becomes more interesting when you relate it to the request rate. 17k/sec is absolutely a worthwhile workload, even when (as likely in the disqus case) reads dominate writes by far.<p>That said the relation of 100 hosts / 17k rps seems about reasonable.<p>However (not meaning to narrow their achievement) the engineer in me can't help but wonder if perhaps even a little more could be squeezed out on the caching front?

I finally got off my butt and  started coding it up.  My time is limited, as I have full-time job and big family.  I'm giving it all I have, but I need sleep and just not enough hours in the day!  :-)  I need your advice.<p>My product is scratching an itch that I have.  The challenge is that I think it's scratching an itch that a lot of other people have too, because every day I see announcements on here from other people launching things trying to solve the problem – albeit via a different approach.  To date, I haven't seen any of them with the features that I think will set my site apart and really get some traction.  But I'm also aware that unique ideas are not so unique.  I dread the day I read ShowHN with something that is nearly identical to what I'm doing.  The particular feature that sets my solution apart is one that isn't developed yet – as it relies on other features to be completed before it can be implemented.<p>Further, I'm not a designer.  So my site is completely minimalistic.  I have two images only!  :-) It makes HN look pretty!  Actually, I think HN is pretty in its simplicity, but was trying to get a point across – my site is very basic and not like the visually cool things I see launched regularly.<p>My questions:<p>1.Should I release w/o the killer feature that I think will set it apart - to at least get some initial traction and feedback?  I could describe it, and mock it up, without real functionality behind it. Or would this be a bad move – in that someone with more time can implement it quicker than me?  I know I shouldn't worry about copy-cats – but I don't want someone to copy an idea that isn't even working yet!<p>2.Should I release w/o a visually nice design?  The eye candy factor is important and I don't know if my minimalistic site will deter people because it isn't pretty.  I'm no PG – and don't know the tolerance level people would have for a site that isn't backed by such a popular group of people.<p>3.I'm completely bootstrapped, and I would like to remain that way.  However, I don't have extra income to pay a designer – so should I give up part of it for design help?  If so, how much?<p>4.Release Early | Release Often – a principle I understand.  But how early is too early?<p>I look forward to benefiting from your collective wisdom.  Thank you.",1298392048

This is borne out by the rate at which new submissions move off the 'New' page (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/newest"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/newest</a>) - in the morning London time (ie, the wee hours in the US), that takes a little over an hour; by afternoon US time it's usually under 30 minutes. (I believe this is borne out by other data as well - that's just the one I've witnessed over time.)<p>So, the largest number of people are on here in that time slot. However, that doesn't mean your visibility is maximised. You want to be on the front page across that time, which is harder to achieve if you submit at that time - after all, your submission will have less than half the time to be seen on the New page before disappearing. So it may be that you want to post mid-morning US Time, having more of a chance to be upgraded to the front page in time for the US afternoon, where hopefully your front page status will maintain enough traction to remain there.<p>Of course, front page success is lightning in a bottle.

For example, I personally haven't observed any evidence of gravitational time dilation, because I haven't looked. I would be a fool to interpret this lack of evidence as evidence that gravitational time dilation doesn't exist. The engineers of the Global Positioning System have evidence.<p>However, after a reasonably rigorous search, one may indeed reasonably conclude that something doesn't exist if no evidence of it has been found, especially when evidence would be easily visible if the thing did exist. The examples the author gave fall into this category: Most likely, given the distribution of humans on Earth, there would be evidence of dodo birds if they were extant.<p>Now, it's important to be careful when estimating the likelihood of stumbling upon evidence of something. Hundreds of new species (most only subtly different than known species) are discovered every year, and there are undoubtedly thousands of oceanic creatures that have never been seen by humans, much less captured and dissected. It would be foolish to deny that there aren't hundreds or thousands of yet-undiscovered species simply because as of now we have no evidence of them.",1298390819

They aggressively dropped their pricing structures to compete with flat-rate ISPs, while their other proprietary competition (Prodigy, GENie) went out of business.  In 1997 half of all families on the Internet got it through AOL.  [1]<p>They just didn&#x27;t do all of the above better than the competition.<p>A major factor that killed AOL was the shift to broadband in the late 90s.  AOL had a huge infrastructure and competitive advantage in providing dial-up access to consumers.  As the Internet grew, though, consumers got hungrier for bandwidth, they got hungrier for content, and the relative share of both of these resources that was <i>not</i> owned by AOL increased.  It was easy to justify subscribing to AOL when they were $10/month for 56.6K access, your local ISP was $10/month for 56.6K access, but AOL gave you all this extra content.  It was a lot harder when you could pay $30/month for 500K/sec ADSL or Cable access that unlocked a whole world of multimedia content.  AOL owned none of the infrastructure that made the broadband net possible.<p>GFiber, Loon, and cell phones risk doing the same thing to Comcast, TWC, and Verizon FIOS now.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL#1990s:_a_new_Internet_age"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL#1990s:_a_new_Internet_age</a>",1431456867

Imagine if each of the 104 billionaires who bought at 432 park ave had bought their own greenwich village townhouse instead.

Some of them aren&#x27;t household names like Level 3 or CenturyLink.<p>> There truly was nothing they could have done.<p>It&#x27;s 1996, sales are terrible, stock price is in the toilet, the newest product line isn&#x27;t selling as well, and it was very expensive to develop as it moved to a different CPU architecture. Moreover, the operating system isn&#x27;t getting better, despite numerous attempts to improve it.<p>There are numerous newspaper articles saying the company should just fold, and return all the money to the shareholders.<p>There was nothing <i>they</i> could have done to save the company either.<p>Except, of course, to bring back Steve Jobs; the company was Apple, and the rest is history.<p>It&#x27;s easy to decry the obscene amounts CEOs receive in compensation, but the right one would have been able to right the sinking ship that was AOL. Of course we&#x27;ll never know if it <i>could</i> have been saved, but it&#x27;s interesting to think about the position AOL was in, back in the 90&#x27;s.<p>The big one was the switch to DSL, which AOL didn&#x27;t keep pace with. I don&#x27;t even recall if they <i>did</i> start offering DSL. My internet experience in the 90&#x27;s was interrupted dial-up and busy signals.<p>DSL changed all that, but AOL didn&#x27;t want DSL, so they got left behind. Suddenly, instead of AOL being the cool new thing, it didn&#x27;t just become staid, it become dysfunctional. Instead of wanting to be on AOL and putting up with busy signals, you kept AOL because you were trapped by the @aol.com email they gave you. The rise of Hotmail took away that last excuse.<p>I don&#x27;t know about better search technology, but if AOL had gotten into the online catalog business, Amazon may not even have gotten off the ground. AOL had the brand name recognition, and a warchest to fund something that was <i>clearly</i> going to happen, it was just the small matter of <i>who</i> was going to win. Grocery delivery was unproven, but books? Literally <i>any</i> book in print (and even some out of print) is available in a few days, shipped to your house. Sign me up!<p>Meanwhile, AOL was content to collect money from their dial-up business.<p>I actually think buying up ISPs to jump start their entry into the DSL market <i>would</i> have worked out well, or at least slowed the downward spiral. It gets them off the shrinking dial-up as into the nascent high-speed broadband market. The purchase of a backbone internet provider, combined with their purchase of Time Warner in 2000 may have prevented Netflix from getting off the ground, and could have jump started the online video streaming business five years faster.<p>Finally, buying an equipment manufacture like Sun may not seem like it would have made sense, but with the racks and racks of computers they already owned, a vertically integrated and merged AOL and Sun could started the popularization of cloud services, helped along by their online catalog and online video services.<p>The benefit of writing this two decades years past AOL&#x27;s heyday is that hindsight is always 20/20. But saying AOL was doomed, and there was no choice in the matter ignores any possible move they could have done along the way.<p>Compared to $166 billion, the purchase price of $4.4 billion is not very much at all, but that&#x27;s still approximately $4.4 billion more money than I have.<p>AOL may not be the household name it once was, but it did manage to pivot away from the dial-up business, and over to the content business. It&#x27;s just that the content business, even a $4.4 billion one, is a different market than everyone in America paying you a monthly fee to get on the Internet.<p>We&#x27;re in the middle of a similar story with Yahoo, and time will tell if  Marissa Mayer is be able to right that ship.",1431456084

These methods ought to be considered &quot;safe&quot;. This allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in a special way, so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested.<p>Naturally, it is not possible to ensure that the server does not generate side-effects as a result of performing a GET request; in fact, some dynamic resources consider that a feature. The important distinction here is that the user did not request the side-effects, so therefore cannot be held accountable for them.",1431455983

This would have the neat effect of breaking your extension, and locking in special treatment.<p>Google would not bother to do this right now, because the referrer trick largely benefits Google (the typical advice is &quot;just Google the headline&quot;), and is not widely abused.

  - The password manager *always* prompts if it wants to save a password. Passwords are not saved without permission from the user.
  - We are the third browser to implement this change, after IE and Chrome.
  - This can be undone locally by flipping the `signon.storeWhenAutocompleteOff` pref (from about:config) off.
  - The rationale behind this change was the widespread abuse of the `autocomplete` attribute to prevent password saving where no prevention is required. This change gives users full control over password saving, without compromising on security (again, the user is always prompted).</code></pre>",1431455525

The argument then becomes, &quot;okay this DRM server was disclosed in prior art, BUT my DRM server includes a memory caching process to reduce loading times for common files.&quot;<p>If you aren&#x27;t super familiar with servers, it might not be apparent that all servers have something like that, or if they don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s obvious.

All the time.<p>It was initially about access to the code that&#x27;s running on your machine, and the ability to modify it - i.e. grant you control of what happens on your hardware. But it was always also about sharing with each other, for free. That&#x27;s been part of the RMS and GNU thing since the beginning.

They <i>chose</i> to base their work on the incredible amount of work others have already put in to the Ubuntu (and general Linux) ecosystem, knowing the license it was under.<p>They have no right whatsoever, none, to now cry about this and your position there is extremely unreasonable. I don&#x27;t get to take another artist&#x27;s song, add an extra drumbeat and release it as my own without regard to the license of that original. This is much the same.<p>>> Taken further, the license that Linux falls under makes like all the more miserable for providing your own value and creativity.<p>It really doesn&#x27;t make anyone&#x27;s life miserable.<p>Basing your work on an immensely more massive body of work done by other people, and then getting arsey about license obligations, is not on.<p>And the GPL is not a minefield, it&#x27;s a reciprocal agreement - you can do what you like with this, but you must preserve the freedoms you get with it and pass those on.<p>It&#x27;s really very simple and fair.",1431455411

There is just no point where one can say that consciousness didn&#x27;t exist before and started exist immediately after. It was just increasing as the complexity of the system increased, and will continue to increase beyond humans. What we call consciousness, the carriers of future consciousness would look at like we look at lizards&#x27; consciousness today.<p>>than any implementation would have to be conscious, the often quoted simulation of a brain inside a computer as well as a gigantic pile of levers, gears and pulleys in the right arrangement.<p>giving that these examples are simpler than a simple cell, it is no surprise that we don&#x27;t observe any noticeable consciousness in these examples.<p>>The thought that a collection of gears can become aware of its existence seems, at least to me, pretty outlandish.<p>Can a collection of gears, given enough size and complexity, behave in a way as to attempt to maximize entropy it would generate over its whole period of existence? Can it make a copy of itself with modifications as to increase the target entropy achievable by the copy? This 2 &quot;can&quot;s is actually what defines the living matter. Consciousness is just the emerging algorithm of maximizing the target entropy. Self-awareness is just ability of algorithms to observe its own &quot;subroutines&quot;.",1431455318

   the line shot straight back up and stayed level again:
   
   “That’s what happens when we do the right thing”, he said while pointing at 
   the drop, “and that’s how much money we lose. We tried it just to see how 
   bad it was for our bottom line. And this is what the data tells us.”
   
   “Wow,” I said, taken aback. My employer clearly had two options: “do the 
   right thing” or “be profitable”. That was the position they had maneuvered 
   themselves into through a series of bad management decisions.
   
   My manager then said, “More than half the company would have to lose their

If I were to use this to record myself snowboarding (like the video shows), that would be a problem. Here in Colorado a typical blue rated mountain run is easily 20m from top to bottom, esp. if you aren&#x27;t gunning it the whole way.  When I ride alone I can maybe go top to bottom in slightly under 20m but I&#x27;m flying and really pushing it the whole time, I wonder if the drone could even keep up in that situation (speed would be over 25mph almost the entire time).<p>Pretty cool but I personally think there is much bigger market for a device designed to record kids playing hockey, basketball, soccer etc... imagine a tripod that tracks your kid, that would be way way more killer and useful for most people and probably a ton cheaper as you could use a smartphone as the camera.<p>Technically it&#x27;s impressive as hell, I just don&#x27;t know about how practical is in actual use.",1431453913

Their pricing certainly doesn&#x27;t reflect it:<p><pre><code>  Web + Smartphone:    $3.75/wk  $16.25/mo  $195/yr
  Web + Tablet:        $5.00/wk  $21.67/mo  $260/yr
  All Digital Access:  $8.75/wk  $37.92/mo  $455/yr
  7-Day Home Delivery: $8.90/wk  $38.57/mo  $463/yr
</code></pre>
There are multiple levels of insanity here:<p><pre><code>  Web + Smartphone & Web + Tablet are identical except
    for device type but Tablet is 33% more.
  Web + Smartphone plus Web + Tablet cost as much
    *together* as All Digital Access (and are feature
    equivalent).
  7-Day Home Delivery *includes* All Digital Access and
    costs about the same. Paper is free?
</code></pre>
None of these pricing strategies appear to be designed to maximize readership, broaden subscription basis, or grow brand penetration. They are structured to capture the most value possible from customers with high switching costs or price indifference. This is what a conservator in a dying market looks like.",1431453821

Rust allows a superset of C/C++ memory management techniques, so there is literally no technical reason you shouldn&#x27;t be able to port a c program to the equivalent rust program. Unlike java, go, etc., this doesn&#x27;t break new ground in terms of optimization but rather verification of existing systems programming techniques.<p>To put this another way, you could write a rust -> c++ compiler and &quot;automagically&quot; get the speed of c++, but the same could not be said of Java.<p>The one area of which I&#x27;m unaware is pointer aliasing (in unsafe code, obviously). I am not entirely sure how well rust can restrict the types to optimize exclusive access to a memory region ala the c `restrict` keyword.

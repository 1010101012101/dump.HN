Average immigrants make more than they would in their countries of origin, but less than average Americans, while average American born workers have done better than the median statistic.

10879833,comment,10876435,10876435,0,0,hellofunk,,,"I think one issue that pops up in many languages is the distinction between functions that have side effects and those that don&#x27;t. In C++ you see standard library higher-order-functions that accept lambdas or other functions, but the documentation says &quot;the function passed should not produce side-effects.&quot; You also see this in Clojure functions, and functions you might write might also expect only side-effect-free functions. The problem is that the functions you pass may not be functions you wrote, they might come from another library and then to be most confident, you must go and look up the source or docs to feel sure. I don&#x27;t think a naming convention is enough, since many may not use the convention. For languages where this is important, I wish there was a compiler or runtime check for these things so the user didn&#x27;t have to take responsibility. Almost as if functions were split into two &quot;function types&quot;, those with and those without side effects. Maybe starting at the lowest level of the core language library, some functions would be noted as causing side-effects, and then any function built that called those functions would automatically be categorized as such, and on up to the top, so that side-effects-beget-side-effects and function parameters that require non-side-effect-functions wouldn&#x27;t allow those to pass.<p>Anyway, it is a problem that is not solved by a naming convention.",1452505447

People don’t judge music solely by some kind of independent metric of appeal. They also judge whether the music is popular within their social circle. Choice of music is one of the mediums people use for communicating.<p>To listen to something nobody except you likes is a little like programming in a language nobody you know uses. We make up all sorts of stories about how network effects affect the quality of a language, the availability of tools, and so on, and all that is true.<p>But it’s also true that we self-identify in a tribal way with our choices, and that those choices have social import. Even if you brag defiantly that you’re a pragmatist who doesn’t care who does or doesn’t use a tool: That’s a lot like being a hipster growing a beard and putting on plaid.<p>So back to music. The vast majority of people wish to belong to the tribe of “The vast majority of people.” They work very hard to study what is and isn’t “mainstream.” There is thus a very natural force <i>by the market</i> to want to have some kind of pop music dominated by just a few superstars at a time.<p>This, I believe, drives a winner-take-all market for pop music, which in turn is a huge incentive for the existence of massive pop marketing machines. Even if you take all the friction out of distribution and discovery, the mainstream <i>want</i> there to be a massive marketing push for pop artists, it helps them judge who is going to be popular.<p>It’s not that much different than picking a JavaScript library because some large and well-heeled organization is devoting themselves to support it. You may personally say it has something to do with bug fixes, but for most people that fact helps them judge whether other people will adopt the library, which helps them judge whether they want to belong to that particular tribe.<p>And most people want to belong to the biggest tribe, and will follow the signals with the biggest boost.<p>Thus, labels or some other kind of very big, very efficient machine for manipulating pop culture.",1452505413

I suspect that Americans do work less over the whole lifetime -- the retirement age has decreased (at least for men, see [1]) while life expectancy is increasing. The problem is that it&#x27;s impossible to estimate total hours worked over lifetime for people presently in their 20s-30s and current pensioners give you a delayed statistic.<p>Personally I think that economy based on a 15-hour work week would be sub-optimal. Total salaries being equal, I&#x27;d rather employ a single person working 40 hours than three working 15 where you need to deal with lots of communication and administrative overhead.<p>Maybe the solution would be taking multiple &quot;gap years&quot; during your career or &quot;mini retirements&quot; but many employers don&#x27;t like holes in your CVs.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.soa.org/News-and-Publications/Newsletters/Pension-Section-News/2012/february/What-Is-The-Average-Retirement-Age-.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.soa.org/News-and-Publications/Newsletters/Pensio...</a>",1452505175

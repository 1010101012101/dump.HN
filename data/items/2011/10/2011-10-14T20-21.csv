3112919,comment,3112749,3112749,5,0,tokenadult,,,"As I've seen him do all too often before, here Wadhwa writes with too little analysis of the situation he is commenting on. Right now, there is a status quo of HUGE subsidies for higher education. Higher education is second only to K-12 education as a line item in the budget of my state and other states. When billions of dollars extracted from taxpayers--including taxpayers who have no prospect of ever attending college--are injected into the current system, it is little wonder that some people have trouble imagining any different system, and most people who try to set up alternatives to the system are doomed to failure. ""The endowments of schools and colleges have necessarily diminished more or less the necessity of application in the teachers. Their subsistence, so far as it arises from their salaries, is evidently derived from a fund altogether independent of their success and reputation in their particular professions."" -- Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Part 3, Article II (1776)
""In modern times [as contrasted with ancient times] the diligence of public teachers is more or less corrupted by the circumstances which render them more or less independent of their success and reputation in their particular professions. Their salaries, too, put the private teacher, who would pretend to come into competition with them, in the same state with a merchant who attempts to trade without a bounty in competition with those who trade with a considerable one. . . . The privileges of graduation, besides, are in many countries . . . obtained only by attending the lectures of the public teachers. . . . The endowment of schools and colleges have, in this manner, not only corrupted the diligence of public teachers, but have rendered it almost impossible to have any good private ones."" -- Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Part 3, Article II (1776)",1318625921

Backyard came out of our own experience at different startups. we spent valuable early engineering cycles setting up infrastructure, much of the time just recreating something that many other people had already built. so we understand the concerns about entrusting core pieces of a technology stack to a thrid-party. we plan on working closely with our users to help adress those concerns.",1318625883

3112913,comment,3103539,3111150,1,0,Goladus,,,"Right, and that's why I think ""gamification"" will be a fad.  Eventually people will see through transparent attempts to lead them by the nose through otherwise completely unengaging content and will move on to something more compelling.<p>Sure, designers will continue to include game mechanics to enhance engagement, it just won't be this crazy concept that everyone obsesses about.  It'll just be a tool you can use sometime if the situation seems right.<p>And I disagree about stackoverflow on both counts.  I believe it is fun, and that competition is a nonessential component to the sites success.  Some people do thrive on competition, others do not.  The core of stackoverflow is the dialogue between askers and answerers.  Maybe say ""rewarding"" instead of ""fun.""  The scores and rules are a nice enhancement to the core experience-- they facilitate public recognition, sorting and organization, among other things.  There has been competition and recognition on Wikipedia for a long time, and they have made no overt attempt to ""gamify"".<p>Another important thing that the stackoverflow game mechanics do is guide users to functionality they might not know about.  What you call ""driving"" users I would call ""leading.""  Hardcore completionist, achievement-oriented, and competitive users are, of course, driven.  The rest, however, are not, and to them features like ""badges"" just bring attention to the wide variety of ways the site can be engaging.  The FAQ is well-written and very useful.  The ""analytical"" badge merely helps draw a little extra attention to it.  vBulletin has a boilerplate FAQ that probably no one has read in years since it's the same on every single forum that uses the software.",1318625864

3112885,comment,3110572,3111480,1,0,mathias_10gen,,,"The global write lock, while important, is probably the most over-written-about and misunderstood issue. The writelock is only held while the db is actually in the middle of an write and tends to only be held for a very brief period (about 10s-100s of microseconds or less) at a time. For example, it is never held across multiple user actions and therefore is closer to a latch than a lock in common RDBMS terminology. The main cases where this caused issues for users are when some data we needed wasn't already in memory so we went to disk to fetch it (~10ms rather than 10us). One of the major improvements to 2.0 was a framework to yield the lock to allow other work while going to disk that is used in the places where this was seen most frequently in production. 2.2 will plug this in more places with the goal to never hold the lock when going to disk. This work is of course in parallel to work to move to DB, collection, and possibly extent-level locking replacing the global lock in almost all cases.<p>As for safe-mode, the waiting that it does is always outside of the lock. It uses a cached datastructure that is protected by a secondary mutex so that it never has to interact with the global dbMutex. If you choose to wait for replication or journalling of your writes, that will block the connection and therefore your client thread so single-threaded tests will show much worse performance with the db mostly idle. If you use more client threads or asynchronous I/O connections you should see roughly identical throughput in aggregate (see mongostat) although much higher latencies compared with not waiting.<p>If you have any questions about this feel free to shoot me an email.

Here are the things which are non-starter for me that I've found:<p>- Loading music is SLOW. I'm seeing a variable response of ~2-10 seconds PER song. This is when I dump a single track to the interface. It doesn't seem to matter which screen I drop the track into. This happens with MP3s and M4As.<p>- Doesn't automatically go to the next track after a track is done.<p>- No search field? It accepts my typing, but doesn't show it anywhere in the GUI.<p>+ The animations and the UI touches are admittedly nice and give it a nice polish. But it doesn't matter if the product underneath doesn't play music well.<p>You're asking me what you should do next with this, but it really depends on what you want to do. Do you want to build a business out of it? What would your business model look like? What is going to make people give you money for this?<p>You might have a hard time developing a business model out of this project as music players are a well-entrenched industry with many successful products already on the market. The only way you'll be able to break into this is by releasing a superior experience. And frankly, the other companies have a huge head start.<p>This is not a bad thing at all! It's okay for this to be a project without trying to make it into a business. The GUI skills from this will certainly help with future products you'll inevitably make!<p>Something that also concerns me is that you're willing to drop college to attend a startup program if they accept you. This should be a clear indicator to you that this is not a project worth dropping everything to work on (because you'd be working on this full-time and have dropped college already if you were that motivated). And even if an incubator sees something valuable in you to go through their program, I would ask yourself why you're even in school if you're willing to drop it for a 3-month program. Figure out what that answer is and see if there are ways to achieve that on your current path. I'm not saying you should or shouldn't drop school, or should/shouldn't apply for an incubator. It just sounds as if you're thrilled about the prospect of being a successful entrepreneur with all the recent buzz these last years. (This is great!)

It's not surprising that they would cancel it, they are a company driven by profit after all. I don't think there is really much to explain. Maybe once it had utility as a way to earn good will among developers, but presumably they don't care too much about that these days, given how little competition and how much brand recognition they have. (Is Steve Yegge is still wondering about that 'arrogance' thing?).<p>It does cost money, but I kind of doubt this is the reason.<p>First thing, I assume that Google will continue to have Code Search or something very much like it available internally. The reason is simple: Like many people here said, this kind of search is useful for us programmers. So Google would be silly to not let its people continue to benefit from it. Google is known to have lots of internal tools written to make its developers more productive - this would be just another one.<p>Second, given that assumption, I wonder how much money it takes to run Code Search publicly. The code is already working, development costs are already paid. How much traffic does it actually receive? I doubt it is that much that it is significant in any way for Google. Google's server infrastructure is very efficient, and the amount of people searching for code isn't that big in absolute terms.<p>So why would Google be shutting it down? I have no idea. I can throw out a few wild guesses, but don't take them too seriously:<p>1. Part of a push to limit the amount of Google websites and services - just to keep the number smaller, more coherent, more cohesive.<p>2. Keeping Code Search an internal tool gives Google another advantage that its developers have that others do not.
2.1. Perhaps Google just finished a major upgrade to Code Search, and decided it wants to keep that internal, and doesn't want to maintain two codebases.<p>3. Fear of potential legal issues, either
3.1. People suing on the assumption that code appearing in Code Search has been 'scanned' by Google, so Google can't say it never saw that code before, say, in a copyright infringement lawsuit (like the Oracle-Google lawsuit), or
3.2. People using Code Search to find similar pieces of code and using that to sue people.

If you use xmalloc() instead of malloc(), and either abjure realloc() or use xrealloc(), haven't you covered all your bases?<p>It's true that a bug could creep in somewhere, but that hardly seems like a particularly damning criticism.  Every place you use xmalloc() instead of malloc() is one less bug, one less potential Mark Dowd Flash exploit.  And you can use nm(1) or the Visual Studio equivalent to find out if your program still has any calls to malloc() or realloc(), and then you can remove them.<p>From my perspective, the problem with rigging malloc() itself to blow up is that there's no portable, standard way to do that.  And, if someone fails to do it when they're porting your code to a new platform, everything will appear to work perfectly, but the port will have introduced a subtle bug that may result in remote-root vulnerabilities.

I'd like to raise a counter argument, about replication, though.<p>In a nutshell, if someone has to reimplement the code, from the details in the paper they've read, its a great check that the original author isn't just reporting the results of subtle bugs, or particularities, in their software.<p>Its true that opening the source allows other researchers look for bugs in the code, and that's good.  But such checks are inherently less thorough than instead having another group replicate the results, in a separate environment, just working from the published paper details.<p>One objection to this 'clean room' replication, is that perhaps its not practical to re-engineer the code that was written for a paper - thats just too much work.  But that's basically saying ""well, we cant replicate the results of this paper, its too much work"" - generally, that is not the way you want to go about doing science.  A cornerstone of science we are willing to accept slower short term progress, in return for more certainty that what we are doing is correct (and hence, hopefully, faster long term progress); painstaking replication is a key part of this philosophy, I think everyone agrees.<p>Consider the neutrinos: they did an experiment; others are trying to suggest reasons for the surprising results.  In the unlikely event the result lasts, other scientists are going to want to redo the experiment.  Ultimately, its not enough to analyze the data, or experimental setup; you want to replicate, and ideally, from the ground up - in a different lab, with different equipment - and, with different code to process the results.<p>Now, maybe the manifesto is aimed at a world where its not possible to replicate based solely on whats in the paper - perhaps there's just too much detail that can't be included: and hence, a lot of the 'science' is inherently tied up in the detail of the code.  I'm sceptical about whether thats a good way to do our science - but if we decide to go down that route, then the 'paper' as publication, the de facto unit of scientific output, is something we will also have to really rethink; and reviewers are going to have to be responsible for signing off on the code, which they don't generally currently do.<p>I think there's an argument, currently, for telling people ""I could give you the code - but it'll only take you a couple of days to write your own code to replicate the results, and it'd be much better if you could do that"" - but I'm sure this varies drastically across domains.<p>I'm not sure where I stand overall - but I don't think its black and white.",1318622509

You can only read so many papers, but by talking to many other people, you expand your accessible information. Other people can mention that this paper is great or that they've seen a series of great papers from a particular lab, etc and point out connections that you might miss. It's not just the frequency of names that matters though, it's the quality of work? Are they doing revolutionary or deeply insightful work or are they doing lots of good work, but that isn't _great_ work.

I think an open source (orbital) rocket could be an interesting and important project.<p>Since, generally, the only parameter to optimize in orbital rocket launches is cost, the goal of the project would be to design the cheapest possible rocket that can reliably deliver a payload of some size to orbit. SpaceX has already done something like this, but we know very little about their design and it may be able to be improved upon in some ways for this specific goal. For example, smaller solid rockets might be much cheaper but are not well rated for life aboard and often cannot carry an average satellite cheaply.<p>I know quite a bit about rockets, and I would be willing to get familiar with some more specifics if needed. But, I don't know if I know or can know enough to get this project off the ground. People would have to be interested in this, then there would have to be a consensus in the goal, and a consensus in what meta-route to take (solid, liquid w/ gas generator or staged combustion cycle, etc.)<p>Might there be interest in this?

Could you elaborate?<p>It would help if you had read the book, it's the kind of thing that ""snaps"", but I'll try to condense it:<p>Think about forms as physical manifestations of the underlying forces acting on it. A good example I once heard is thinking about a water drop: if you take a picture of one, you can explain why it has the shape it has because that's the result of all the laws of physics acting on it at that moment. And because of that, it really couldn't have a different form than it has, unless you bend the laws of nature. It's the purest form possible.<p>Analogously, a human-designed artifact is a physical (or otherwise) manifestation of the underlying forces acting on it (which would be the requisites). In a concrete example, if you were designing a kettle, that would be all the things you need to optimize for: it should be placed atop a oven; it should have such and such size to fit in a cabinet; it should allow water to heat; it should allow someone to grab it without burning their hands; and so on.<p>As you can imagine, it is <i>really hard</i> to enumerate all the required (and often conflicting) requisites. For instance, if I were designing an artifact for heating water without stating that it should be placed atop a oven, I could arrive at a completely different form (e.g.: faucet heater). The obvious takeaway is that design, as a creative discipline, is only as good as the number of requisites a designer manages to contemplate and successfully meet (let's call it the ""fitness function"").<p>Therefore, for all collection of requisites (underlying forces), a perfect artifact with 100% fitness should exist (purest form). If that's true, then good design can be judged objectively by its ""fitness function"", quantifying how well it meets the proposed criteria, or how far it steers away from the ""purest form"". Better yet, if we devise an ideal design process, these optimal forms themselves could emerge from the requisites (that is Christopher Alexander's research, and from there it gets heavily philosophical).<p>To wrap it up, when you say an UI ""looks good"" at first glance, you are mainly judging the artistic prowess on it (which <i>is</i> subjective). The real judgment of the design though is in how well it meets the requisites (fitness, or how far away it steers from an ideal UI). So when you use said UI, you are judging the design when you quantify: how intelligible it is, how well it allows you to do what you need to do, and so on (since those are the raisons d'etre of UIs). And yes, eye candy can very well <i>be</i> one of these criteria. In fact, that's the criteria most products are optimized for, subconsciously, mainly because it's the easiest to quantify (designer shows the design to client, gauges emotional response, iterate). Hence why our confusion between design and eye candy.",1369026885

5736001,comment,5734680,5734680,2,0,elangoc,,,"I've been thinking for a long while, now, about how to stitch together the many threads of thought around diet, nutrition, environment, and economics:<p>1) eating a plant-based diet is healthier (Mark Bittman), or at the very least, eating natural things (Michael Pollan)
2) eating meat costs more, and it threatens the environment (<a href=""http://www.marketplace.org/topics/sustainability/commentary/worried-about-climate-change-eat-less-meat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marketplace.org/topics/sustainability/commentary/...</a>), including in China (<a href=""http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2012/11/china-meat.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2012/11/china-meat.html</a>)
3) for that matter, others foods besides meat that come from animals (ex: dairy) have the same effect.  Roughly 75% of the world has some degree of lactose intolerance (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance</a>)
4) nutrition is more than calorie counting -- it is about getting nutrients in the diet (<a href=""http://supplementsos.com/blog/how-to-actually-eat-healthily-o-1-per-day/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://supplementsos.com/blog/how-to-actually-eat-healthily-...</a>)  Lentils play an important part as a quality, cheap source of protein.
5) there are ways to make good food affordable to the people who can least afford it (<a href=""http://www.kpbs.org/news/2012/jul/28/new-mobile-food-truck-serves-san-diegos-homeless-d/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kpbs.org/news/2012/jul/28/new-mobile-food-truck-s...</a>)  In fact, the idea (or 'business model') of making necessary things affordable to the people who can least afford it as been around for 50 years (<a href=""http://infinitevisionaries.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infinitevisionaries.com/</a>)
6) a very important factor to incentivize people to switch diets is knowing that the food will taste good.  While it might involve a slight change in cultural diet, this is absolutely possible (<a href=""http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/international/the-dosa-man-of-new-york"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/international/the-dos...</a>)
7) the vegetarian diet of Tamils in Tamil Nadu (India) and Tamil Eelam (Ceylon) is wide & varied, largely dairy-free, and mostly gluten free.  This largely applies for the other South India states, too.  The diet consists in large parts of lentils, leafy greens, vegetables, and spices.
8) in particular, the diet in Tamil Nadu/Tamil Eelam of 50 years ago should be examined, which is before the Green Revolution occurred in India.  Back then, many of the healthier grains eaten in large quantities by a large swathe of people (millet, sorghum, finger millet, etc.).
9) An unintended consequence of the Green Revolution in India and China in the 1950's is that, at least in India, many of the healthier grains eaten in large quantities by a large swathe of people (millet, sorghum, finger millet, etc.) were dropped in favor of the far less nutritional white rice, which was for many just a once-in-a-while treat.  In North India, the favored, newly-proliferated crop of choice was wheat.  (Both rice and wheat are dreadfully water-intensive.)  Brown rice doesn't exist there, but in the region, only people in Kerala and Tamil Eelam eat a red rice that is similarly nutritious.  Of course, this is said to be not as nutritious as things like finger millet or ""thinai"" (similar to quinoa).
10) People talk about the importance of vitamin B12, and that you can only get it from animal based sources.  But this diet has been around for 4,500 years, people have been just fine. (<a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2013/01/indus_civilization_food_how_scientists_are_figuring_out_what_curry_was_like.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2013/01/indus_civili...</a>)  I'm sure people have been vegetarian for at least 2,000 years of that, if I judge based on the Thirukkural (2,000 year old literature of virtuous maxims, of which 10 talk about not eating meat).  There are athletes and body-builders in America who are vegetarian and vegan.<p>So I really think that a restaurant (or at the least, food truck) should pop up selling a variety of vegan Tamil food at a very low price.  This would solve so many problems.  I've been thinking of this for a long while now, but I would be just happy if someone 'steals' the idea and runs with it.<p>(note: I'm sure there are other ways to achieve low cost, high nutrition, vegan diets in varied, tasty ways, but this is part of my birth tradition.  You can treat that as a disclaimer / proof of authenticity. For me, personally, I'm fairly lactose-intolerant, and I'm wondering now that I might be gluten intolerant. I've been trying to be more vegan/vegetarian for the past 5 months, and it's helped a lot in my finances.  It hasn't negatively impacted exercising.  I'm hoping to see more change once I start cooking!...)",1369026204

Many popular systems were hacked together by amateurs.  Fidonet was the work of amateurs -- a global computer network that <i>remains</i> in use to this very day.<p>It is also <i>not</i> the case that systems trusted with large amounts of money must necessarily be secure.  If the past 20 years have taught us anything, it is that security is not even within the consciousness of most users of payment systems, at least when it comes to online payments.  That credit cards were <i>ever</i> used for Internet payments, rather than Chaum's systems, should be proof enough of that.  All that standards between most people's bank accounts and a potential thief is a password, yet there is little demand for smartcards or other more secure systems.<p>""Message encryption, TLS, and Secure Shell are generally trusted as being secure, but all pale in comparison to the complexity of bitcoin in terms of what they attempt to achieve""<p>Why separate encryption from TLS and SSH?  TLS and SSH <i>are</i> encryption (and authentication) systems.  Here, on the other hand, is a secure multiparty computation system that has served a large user base for over a decade without major incident:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixmaster_anonymous_remailer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixmaster_anonymous_remailer</a><p>The most major attack on remailers so far was the recent attempt to de-anonymize the Pittsburgh bomb threats.  It is unclear if the FBI was able to break the security of Mixmaster even after compromising numerous remailers; a man has been indicted, but the evidence (last I checked) remains secret.  It seems unlikely, unless the FBI had compromised all the remailers except for the ones they raided prior to their investigation; that would mean that the FBI had effectively compromised <i>the whole network</i>, which is beyond what any secure computation system can protect against.<p>Similarly, there is the Danish Sugar Beet Auction system.  This system has fewer workers than Mixmaster, and certainly less than Bitcoin, but it was designed and engineered by prominent researchers and serves thousands of users (only a slightly smaller scale than Bitcoin).  The system has been used for a few years now:<p><a href=""http://fc09.ifca.ai/papers/15_Secure_MPC_goes_live.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fc09.ifca.ai/papers/15_Secure_MPC_goes_live.pdf</a><p>""Yes, bitcoin is vulnerable to a 51% network attack""<p>Let's be <i>very</i> clear here:  Bitcoin is not merely vulnerable to a majority of <i>parties</i> behaving maliciously; that would be acceptable in a multiparty computation system.  What Bitcoin is vulnerable to is <i>one</i> party working just slightly harder than all the other parties.  In other words, a single malicious party, working in polynomial time, can successfully attack Bitcoin (whatever the definition of a successful attack actually is).  The attack allows one party to deny confirmations on transactions involving another party.  It allows one party to double-spend the currency.  It allows one party to prevent other parties from being paid for mining.<p>This is why I said Bitcoin is the work of amateurs and enthusiasts.  This is the sort of attack that nobody in the cryptography research community would consider acceptable.  This is not merely a disconnected between theory and practice (as is the case with PGP, TLS, and Mixmaster, all of which diverge somewhat from their theoretical foundations); the vulnerability exists in the very design of the Bitcoin protocol.<p>There are other signs that Bitcoin is the work of amateurs.  The protocol specification is hard to pin down; much of the design is documented only with code, rather than in the original paper.  There is no threat model and no formal security definition.  The security analysis in the original paper focuses on a <i>specific</i> method of attacking Bitcoin, without ruling out any other methods.  None of this is something you would expect to see out of expert cryptographers, and to suggest that it is the work of an accomplished mathematician is beyond wishful thinking.<p>If you want to compare Bitcoin to the work of experts, why don't you take a look at the work of experts?  Here, for example, is some important work in the field of secure multiparty computation:<p><a href=""http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~rafail/PUBLIC/57.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~rafail/PUBLIC/57.pdf</a><p>Does the original Bitcoin paper even <i>remotely</i> resemble this?

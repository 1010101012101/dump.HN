In fact it might be the majority of their waking hours.  Schools make a huge difference.  And good teachers do too.<p>I've seen great teachers in horrible schools make a huge difference.  The tough part though is that follow-up with kids is tough.  You see a class make incredible improvements one year and then over the next four years have less than stellar teachers again.  They slowly give back what thy've gained.<p>This is why the Harlem Children Zone is an example of the right step.",1286600300

Is all that data put in by hand, ie- i just won The Rock Uberness +12 killing to Bats, and I put it in the app, indicate how much dkp it cost, who i was with etc.<p>I'd almost rather see your app as an app in facebook where they do the hard work in providing the platform for communication/connectedness and you focus on all the bit elements around it.<p>If all this data goes in by hand and i suspect is does, the feeling of work overcomes me but i'm no the hardcore raider.  Hardcore fanboys will probably dig it but they want some sex in the app bad.  The RiotACT feels sexy but feels stuck as well.<p>I think you need to take 10 steps back, breathe, sit down with 5 different types of users, the noob that just joined the guild, the guy thats been there awhile, the crazy rabid collect everything on the planet girl, PVP master dude X that likes to hurt people and the guy/girl who started the guild in the first place.  Talk simple flows outloud without looking at anything.  Then go back to your app and figure out a way to REMOVE 50% of what you see.  Refine, present it to those 5 peeps and go from there.",1286600281

That's not to say <i>standardized</i> tests are most effective types of tests for learning, but they certainly have their place in a public educational system.<p>But hell, what do I know?

However, I prefer well written (and civil) opinionated film reviews if for no other reason a strong opinion creates discussion and interest.<p>Further, specific and concrete examples of ""good teachers"" presented by either the film maker or reviewer would have been absurd (but the review's point was the the film didn't even attempt to address the issue of a good teacher).  The notion of a ""good teacher"" is absurd, I think, because it doesn't exist.  Consider your kindergarten teacher and advanced math prof.  One was probably nurturing and kind, the other an expert in a complex subject.

Regardless of which side each person is on, it's clear that everyone is uniting under a common goal - to improve our nations schools - and it's inevitable that we would all have slightly different approaches and goals.<p>What I wonder is how many people like yourself will take that sudden gnawing question and begin working towards the change you believe in.  Will it create a new wave of activists, movers, shakers and changers?  Or just change the popular topic of conversation at cocktail parties and social news websites?",1286600015

1774348,comment,1774156,1774282,0,0,Empact,,,"Well, switching our schools to a model of choice, where parents choose where to send their kids, really is a meta-solution beyond test scores.  Test scores are used to exemplify kids' behavior because it's easy, it's concrete (in the ""what gets measured gets managed"" sort of way), but I doubt most parents who flee district schools for charter schools start or end with test scores: instead they consider culture, goals, outcomes, safety.  The test scores are used to prove good charter schools can be, and are better than district schools, but they aren't the only measure - just the most compact one to communicate.<p>There's a more general problem that judging a teacher concretely, fairly, consistently, is damn-near impossible. I don't think there's an easy answer to the question of what an administrator would use in the absence of value-added education (i.e. the application of test scores), but I'll bet the parents act independently of that system, and serve as a check on it.",1286598883

The conclusion was that smarter children wake up later than dumber children.<p>One possible explanation of this: children in privileged families don't have to take the bus or walk to school. Therefore, they can afford to wake up 40 minutes later on weekdays! So they go to sleep later. They also live in safe neighborhoods where it's reasonable for teenagers to be out at one in the morning.<p>You can draw almost no conclusions from this article.

1774340,comment,1774156,1774250,0,0,astine,,,"""fails to provide any clear examples of what makes a good teacher""<p>I can provide what I believe the be an example of a good teaacher: When I was in highschool I had a number of teachers but the one who stuck out the most a man who taught us religious education (I went to Catholic school.)  On the first day of class, this man, to show just how important he thought that this one point was, dropped to his knees and shouted. His enthusiasm grabbed my attention and made the lecture much more interesting.<p>This man tought us more classes and each one he tought with a sense of dynamism and enthusiasm which was infectious. He knew his subject matter, was passionate about it, was intellectually curious, wanted us to be so as well. Not only did he hold himself to high standards, he held the class to high standards as well, and all of his together made us, particularly me, want to learn.<p>I once had the privilaege to sit in on the disertation of a man who was discussion what he believed the best approach to education was. His conclusion was that a teacher's role was was to act as a sort of guide to the student. To inspire the student and motivate him to learn. His belief was that teaching was first and formost, a relationship between the student and the teacher.<p>I agree. Growing up I loved school, but I went to a very small school with a very strong sense of community. I knew all the teachers and they all knew me and it helped to make learning a very rewarding experience. I think the crux of it is this: most of my immediate role models growing up loved to learn and loved their subjects and I learned from them to learn and an appreciation of the same subjects.<p>In today's public schools, there is a certain lack of interpersonalization eityher due to management style, regulations, or budget issues, which makes it harder for the teachers to connect with the students and teach. I don't know what the root cause of this is, but I think it is a major factor in the ineffectiveness of the system.",1286598487

If it's possible for a teacher to ""teach the test"", and students can pass it just by route memorization, well then surely these are some pretty horrible tests!<p>It's rare to hear people want to reform the actual format and content of the tests to ensure that ""teaching the test"" is less possible. You could argue, for example, allowing more free-form answers, or creative test formats that allow students to display critical thinking skills to the grader would do just as much to reduce the ""teaching to the test problem"" as throwing out tests as the primary means of evaluating performance, but you don't really hear this argument all that often.<p>Admittedly I know little about it, but I find it pretty hard to believe that the best teachers, who do engage their students and provide them a solid education, end up with classrooms of worldly students that end up failing standardized tests.",1286597761

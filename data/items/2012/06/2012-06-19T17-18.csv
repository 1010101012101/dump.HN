This is not as much of a problem with the later Airs, and not for the reason you might think... (it isn't just that WiFi became more plentiful).<p>Instead, the MacBook Air 2010/2011 came with two USB ports, and the 2012 model <i>adds</i> a thunderbolt port: it is totally fine to use an adapter on a random extra port. Instead, the 2008 MacBook Air had a <i>single</i> USB port; this, combined with the mini display port, was the only extensibility on the device.<p>In essence, everything you could possibly attach to this device but the monitor had to go in to the one port, so if you wanted 1) cellular or wired internet and 2) an iPod/iPhone, you couldn't do it. I had a friend that was travelling and ended up sitting outside of a hotel in his car trying to steal enough WiFi just to upgrade his phone to the latest firmware.<p>However, it isn't just these external inconveniences that defined this device; to get an idea of just how spartan the 2008 MacBook Air was, you have to realize that they didn't even manage to get stereo speakers into it: yes, the thing had only one mono speaker. This was fixed in the 2010 versions. ;P<p>While the RAM configuration on the 2008 MacBook Air trounces your FSC Q2010 (a device that, despite its name, seems to have been sold in 2006?), it still couldn't go past 2GB, which even at the time (the contemporary MacBook Pro took 4GB) limited your options as a developer, or even a browser of many websites. In 2010 they upped it to 4GB maximum.<p>Looking at the 2006 specifications for this FSC Q2010, it is ludicrous just how much stuff they stuck in it.... I mean, you had a 2G cellular radio... the people I know who travelled with the Air had to carry around a massive USB dongle to accomplish that (as in 2008, phone tethering wasn't yet that common or convenient).<p>In essence, no: I'd argue that the MacBook Air, in 2008, was a horrible device that was mostly based on some kind of weird design fetish of ""how thin can I make a computer housed in a metal case"". It was not really attempting to be a usable system: it was at best a proof-of-concept for what, after two years of re-engineering effort, they might be able to make into an awesome machine.<p>The result at the time was then large (width/depth), underpowered (RAM/CPU), under-featured (mono speakers), and unextensible (a single port); this is even in comparison to computers that had come out years earlier (the 2006 FSC Q2010) that were significantly lighter (2.2lbs vs. 3.0lbs).",1340128369

If I feel sleepy and need some extra rest, no big deal.

The objective was only to have fun. Telling my friends their login passwords, controling their pcs, (screen streaming, key logging, file management, mouse and kb control, some nice screen effects like making the screen move like ocean waves, launch programs, it was fun, lol). There were like 200 machines connected. The infection was simple (auto-installed in services/run) and later it was even network-automated (when I got the admin pass). Then, I	handed the commanding program to some friends who used it a little bit too uch. We even had the net admins credentials, so we started to get some extra benefits (like internet outside the internet lab, etc). The admins realized what was happening, and started to use Norton ghost in every pc, first once a week (before it was once every 2 weeks), then, as the infections didnt stop and they started to get very paranoid, they run Norton ghost every single day. It all ended when they discovered a copy of the the source code I	had given to a friend of mine. They confronted him, but luckly he took the blame (as he later told me, it was very dumb of him to have saved a copy in his own account. But he managed to convince them that it was just a learning project that went  little bit too far. They reprimanded but nothing serious happened to him.  So, he is still one of my closest friends,=)",1340127653

Second, they give context to the timing of events by subtly matching them up with the day-night cycle; despite the advent of artificial lighting, our species is still instinctively diurnal, and this is a great source of intuitions about time.

4132873,comment,4132356,4132356,1,0,anvandare,,,"Disclaimer: I don't know what I'm talking about. :)<p>To go into full bombastic and Cassandra mode: the PC market is vaporizing. People are now fully expecting to have a 24/7 connection to YouTube/Google (Maps)/Wikipedia/Facebook/Hulu/What-have-you. They want media-consumption/entertainment devices (Google's Chromebooks: just an internet browsing device). Before, the only way to access those things was through the home-kitchen-garden PC most people had: a bulky big thing sitting in some corner of the living room or their bedroom. Then laptops became more popular because you can move around with those (though they're still somewhat bulky and cable-y). Then came smartphones and tablets and suddenly you have a light, more portable entertainment device you can carry with you anywhere! Then of course comes the question: why still have a computer in the first place if all you're doing is easily replacable by shaking/tapping the screen? (Yes, for gamers and workers alike, PC's are more than internet-devices and require keyboard/mice-input that's better than a touchscreen, but they're a minority.)<p>The problem for Microsoft is, of course, that they're missing the boat. Ever since that holy(?) union many aeons ago between the IBM PC and Microsoft, they have been in 90%+ control of the market. That golden era is now at an end since, in the coming years, most people will stop buying a PC and just go for a tablet/smartphone option instead. Apple and Android (and a lot of others with their own OS) have already colonized vast swaths of land in that New World, and Microsoft is now in trouble: if the PC market is going to shrink that means their total domination of that market (and all the benefits that brings when developers want to build things) means less and less. While they're sure to be in total control of heavy-duty-use-computers (that is, computers intended for office work and gaming) for quite a while to come, that means nothing if the future (kids who are growing up and will eventually join the workforce) is being made in a non-Microsoft land. 
(The main reason why Microsoft is so eager with its academic licenses and so little interested in combatting OS piracy: if people are used to working with X, they'll want to work with X. If the New World becomes the biggest (most profitable) World, whoever's in control of that might one day launch a reverse-colonization of the Old World of said heavy-duty-use-computers...)<p>None of what I'm saying is really new or shocking (or even correct?). So what does this mean? It means that Microsoft has to focus on a future tablet-dominated market, which means it has to bring out a new OS built/ready for that (Windows 8). But there is no IBM with a PC (tablet) this time Microsoft can hook on to and get a free ride to market domination, so they have to build their own (which they now have) and pray that they can reverse the coming tide that threatens to sweep them as it did IBM so long ago: into being just a huge (but no longer dominating) software company that focuses on work applications. Hopefully the market will stay shattered and no one can establish a quasi-monopoly, since it seems to lead to lack of competition and thus lack of innovation. In the Game of Software, you either innovate or you die. :)<p>(And now I'm going to click that button and see that in the time it took me to write all that five other people have written the same in a more succinct and funnier way, ah well!)",1340125555

""Stop claiming your lemonade stand is profitable if it only pays for itself if you don't count the person selling the lemonade.""<p>That's fair.  But the Internet doesn't work that way.  If you develop something once, you don't need to keep standing there and keep developing it.  The whole reason the article is wrong can be boiled down to this.  For more nuanced response you can see my other comments.<p>Basically, it would be like saying, ""A restaurant that makes 50,000 per month in profit isn't profitable if the person who made it is Bill Gates.""<p>Since, ""automatically"" Bill Gate's time is worth a lot more doing just about anything else other than launching a restaurant.  But come on.  When it comes time to buy the restaurant and see how much it makes in profit so you can see how much you will pay for it - do you really think you'll reconsider the whole thing as unprofitable just because Bill Gates spent way more of his time on it than can possibly be valued at as low as that?<p>Get real.  From an investment standpoint, nobody cares about the founder's development time.  And guess what the article is about?  Investment standpoint.",1340125331

The problem with SO is it doesn't aim to be a QA site on the longer run. It aims to be a database of programming answers site that slowly evolves to solving most commonly faced programming problems. I don't know if their aim is to be advertising based revenue site on the longer run.<p>I ask a question because I want to get help. It has so happened when I absolutely can't get anything out of the problem at hand. I go on SO and ask a question, often I've been down voted down to oblivion, then I delete the question. Because all I see in response is sarcasm, cynicism and attempts by commenters to prove how big a fool I am.<p>To me stack overflow looks like site that wishes to attract people who already know answers to their questions, but want it put in a community wiki kind of way.<p>But I do agree that a simple Google search on SO sites, gives you solutions to most commonly known programming problems. And not just that most commonly known problems on areas that stack exchange sites deal with. These address most problems people face daily. Tough problems is a different cup of tea. But most common problems often get answered and their database seems to be growing with regards to those problems. And this might also be a great business model for SO.<p>SO was the cool new shiny tool, few years back. We all like to play with Shiny tools. Until something new, and more shiny come along.<p>These days most of colleagues ping me with interesting answers on quora. I would be happy with Quora opening their questions for reading without opening an account.",1340125266

One company painted a house green just for SXSW...painting is horrible for the environment. Generators were humming 24/7 all over downtown. Traffic was at a standstill from morning to night every day, with cars pumping out smog. Bottled water was being distributed everywhere at a disgusting rate. And all of it was in the service of companies pounding me in the face with ads at every turn.<p>I'm not the biggest fan of SXSW, if it wasn't apparent, and the environmental impact is one of the reasons I dislike it so much (but mostly the pervasive corporate agenda invading one of my favorite cities in such a vulgar manner).",1340125253

If you look at YC as if it were a product, you could say its adoption is highest among people below 30.<p>I did look this up before submitting my comment.  If you figure that there aren't many 15 year olds getting into YC and the distribution is flat, then that means there aren't many 35 year olds getting in either.  I think the distribution is probably not flat, and probably peaks somewhere in 20-27 years of age, and that there are probably 40+ year olds who have been admitted and that there are also larger macro dynamics (e.g.: the age at which people get out of college is centered around low 20s) at work here.<p>From: <a href=""http://www.ycombinator.com/faq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ycombinator.com/faq.html</a>

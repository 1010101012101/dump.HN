What I was pointing out in my post was a subtle bias towards overemphasizing China&#x27;s multi-ethnic nature.  China is not especially multi-ethnic, and many of the countries in that list have ethnic minorities of similar size to China.  E.g. Afghanistan, Israel, Poland, Russia and South Africa (Khoisan vs Bantu).",1379890773

I&#x27;ve lived in a couple of countries outside the US and have travelled extensively.  I can&#x27;t think of many people who don&#x27;t strive to improve their lives, provide for their families, own a home, perhaps own a business and, generally speaking, have a good life without worries, health or financial problems.  This is not an idea rooted in the US at all.<p>How do you achieve these things?  Well, should these things be handed to you by a government?  Well, that&#x27;s not going to happen anywhere in the world.  You have to work for these things.  That doesn&#x27;t mean hard labor.  That means that you have to focus on what it is you want and lay out a course through which you can reach those goals.  No matter where you put your finger on the globe this requires determination, lots of work and focus.  It might mean going to a vocational school, college or university to learn something in preparation.  It could mean saving money for years in order to open a small business.  It could mean learning how to find people who will invest in your vision.  It could mean dedicating every free moment you have to slowly inch towards your goals.  It could mean a million different things.  None of which are unique to Americans or the United States.<p>A lot of Americans have this myopic ego-centric view of the universe.  I don&#x27;t know of anyone who&#x27;s been exposed to a variety of cultures and ideas who things this way.  There are brilliant and exceptional individuals all over the world.  Not one of them succeeds without a solid dedication to a vision.  Not one of them succeeds because the State drives them to succeed.  Not one of them advances in life because they waste their lives away watching TV, playing video games and hanging out on Facebook all day.  Those who do succeed work hard.  With &quot;hard&quot; not necessarily being defined as &quot;hard physical work&quot; but rather an intense and sustained focus and dedication to what it is they want out of life despite their current circumstances and station in life.",1379890701

It gets really hot the deeper you go. There are a lot of mines already where it&#x27;s very difficult for humans to exist for very long.<p>Also, availability. There&#x27;s a lot of stuff in the earth. But after 4 billion years gravity happened. All elements have different densities. Turns out a lot of the metals that are really, really useful also turn out to be pretty dense. Think uranium and platinum as examples. Most of these elements have sank into the deep mantle and the core over time. The bits we find left over aren&#x27;t even a taste of how much is collectively in the earth but can&#x27;t get to. On a side note, it&#x27;s been theorized that the massive amounts of uranium that sank to the core has been powering the earth for billions of years. Basically, the earth is a giant fission reactor.<p>The third point is that there&#x27;s a lot more stuff up there than down here. If you had to pick a direction to mine, in the long term it&#x27;s going to be easier and more profitable to mine the stuff in space than to dig deeper into the ground.",1379890582

This should be contrasted with the originally envisioned costs of $118 per kilogram (approximately $53 per pound) of payload in 1972 dollars ($1,400/kg, [approximately $630 per pound] adjusting for inflation to 2011)<p>> The launch rate was significantly lower than initially expected. While not reducing absolute operating costs, more launches per year gives a lower cost per launch. Some early hypothetical studies examined 55 launches per year (see above), but the maximum possible launch rate was limited to 24 per year based on manufacturing capacity of the Michoud facility that constructs the external tank. Early in shuttle development, the expected launch rate was about 12 per year. Launch rates reached a peak of 9 per year in 1985 but averaged fewer thereafter.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Space_Shuttle_program"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Space_Shuttle_...</a>",1379890518

That confuses two entirely different issues.<p>A program is commercial if it is developed as a business activity. A commercial program can be free or nonfree, depending on its manner of distribution. Likewise, a program developed by a school or an individual can be free or nonfree, depending on its manner of distribution. The two questionswhat sort of entity developed the program and what freedom its users haveare independent.<p>In the first decade of the free software movement, free software packages were almost always noncommercial; the components of the GNU/Linux operating system were developed by individuals or by nonprofit organizations such as the FSF and universities. Later, in the 1990s, free commercial software started to appear.<p>Free commercial software is a contribution to our community, so we should encourage it.

Hydrocarbons would probably be good, so I suppose you could mine the atmospheres of the gas giants for those. Interstellar travel will involve strapping a reactor to a large iceberg lassoed from the Ort belt and accelerating for one half of the trip, then decelerating for the other half.<p>Space travel will require space mining (uranium, water, gold, titanium, lithium, etc)<p>Think of all the things involved: mining equipment, (robots) depots, transport, refueling stations, distribution.

Isn&#x27;t this just a gentle way of saying that you have a bias?<p>Academic research and production code have different, conflicting, requirements. That there are people good at one rather than the other is not surprising. I know people who are fantastic researchers, but their code should never go into a production system. I know people who write beautiful code, but they&#x27;d never have something good enough for academia.<p>> There&#x27;s no fundamental reason that you should expect that a PhD (especially in CS) would be less able to write code than any other randomly selected applicant.<p>A PhD versus a coder straight out of university, or a PhD versus someone who has 3 years experience writing production code?",1379887616

It is a useful benefit. However, it&#x27;s not required. Indeed, if you&#x27;re shooting your film in Canada or Australia (which is fairly common) you&#x27;re not going to really be able to make much use of the platoon of extras the US army is willing to lend you.<p>Similarly, the DoD doesn&#x27;t have to spend money &#x27;buying&#x27; the support of movie studios <i>because the American public already want pro-US military films</i>. Studios want to make films that will bring in buckets of money. Audiences in the US are far more willing to go and watch patriotic films than those that question the actions of the military or government.<p>You&#x27;d have lots of pro-US war/military films with or without DoD support. What&#x27;s interesting is that we&#x27;re starting to see films being edited - and entirely new scenes being added - for non US markets that are not quite so American-centric.

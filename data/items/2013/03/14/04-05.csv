5373144,comment,5372726,5373022,10,0,ChuckMcM,,,"<i>Personally I don't see why this resonates so much with the HN community.</i><p>Really? This is like a nerd mantra, it hits so many stereotypes in so few words. Orson talked about it at BayCon once when it came up.<p>I don't have a clear memory of exactly what he said but I took away from it that smart, introverted, people have a terrible time seeing anything outside their pool of influence, like looking at your shoes in a crowd and saying ""everyone is crowding around me because I'm the coolest"" when if you looked up you would see a pack of wolves circling the crowd. So all of their evaluation in their environment is about them and how people around them are responding.<p>An artifact of that inward looking view is to construct an internally consistent explanation for why things suck now but didn't before. That always targets people who are not like them (the introvert) and for whom the introvert cannot understand their motivations or values. (and more often than not in a software company that is ""suits"", aka business people or managers)<p>You combine that with a changing market place, and the thing that made the software successful before isn't valid any more, but if the programmers don't know why the software was successful in the first place they can't understand what changed or how to fix it.  Imagine an artist who paints with charcoal, gets discovered, people buy their works, and then fashion moves on, and the artist goes broke. To an external viewer, fashion simply moved on, the artist was there (and fashionable for a time) and then they weren't. But <i>internally</i> the artist may have no concept of how briefly they were fashionable and now they weren't. Instead they construct an externalization of ""discovery"" where suddenly people begin to understand what it is they are doing with their art, and when they move on it is always some external force which has corrupted the minds of people seeing it or modified their vision. To accept the alternative, that their success was luck and fashion, rather than some deeper meaning, may be too harsh to think.<p>People cling to sense of destiny and purpose rather than consider themselves the random connection of ova and zygote and circumstance. Where is the <i>meaning</i> in that?<p>Orson captured this tension wonderfully in his essay, it resonates both with the bees who desperately want to be special and with the bee keepers who want productive bees without understanding that the bee's production is a byproduct of flowers and normal bee activity, it's a side effect of where the hive is and where the flowers are. Many software companies are fashion objects, successful ones are constantly producing new concepts and new ideas to stay in the limelight. Unsuccessful ones take a single success and assume they are done, nothing left to do but iterate. But fashion doesn't work like that.",1363236379

It's essentially the English language equivalent of needing ways to express less than, greater than, less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to. I know Orwell was criticising people who <i>misuse</i> it, but he beats his fists a bit too hard for my liking in that essay. Related, I get annoyed when people aggressively attack ""I don't disagree"" with ""then just say I AGREE!"". The phrase ""I don't disagree"" is useful to convey ""I might agree, I don't know whether I agree, I don't have an opinion, I agree with some of it and disagree with small details, any or all of these or more, but I'm certainly not disagreeing with you outright at this moment"".

Android sits somewhere between ""gift to hackers"" and ""Windows XP"". Phil Schiller's tweet was pointing out the consequences of this and how it shows up in successful attacks performed against the Android platform. F-Secure, even though they're an AV firm, does good work once in a while :-).<p><a href=""http://www.f-secure.com/static/doc/labs_global/Research/Mobile%20Threat%20Report%20Q4%202012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.f-secure.com/static/doc/labs_global/Research/Mobi...</a><p>EDIT: I'll give you a few hints.<p>First, Android hasn't solved the updating problem. It's getting better but at far too slow a rate. Every day, hundreds of thousands more devices that takes month to years to patch are entering the market. Furthermore, poor patch management by OEMs and carriers mean that sometimes they think they've patched when they've really rolled back updates. They do this unknowingly because their software deployment processes are abysmal. See <a href=""http://www.xray.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xray.io</a> for more info.<p>Second, Android exploit mitigations are very, very weak. It lacks code-signing, one of the strongest mitigations available (just go ask an iOS jailbreaker). Apps have access to a shell. The Linux kernel is full of infoleaks that make kernel ASLR nearly useless. App Permissions, though many people think they help with this problem, actually have nearly no effect whatsoever on the ability to root/jailbreak/privilege escalate on Android. This is what I meant by ""blaming users"" for security problems, since so many people fall back on ""educating"" people not to allow apps with certain permissions even though, ironically, it does nothing. End effect: even if Android could patch, rooters will write new exploits when they need them, as they need them. It's getting harder, but it's nowhere near where it needs to be and we're on version 4 now.<p>Third, Bouncer has a severely limited ability to impact this problem. Due to the lack of code signing and the overall architecture of Android, Bouncer can't ensure that the app that it scans is the app that runs on the phone. Apps can dynamically update their own code at runtime. Bouncer appears to rely principally on dynamic, rather than static, verification leading to tricks you can play with timers and environment detection (these attacks have been proven). Further, what about third party appstores? There are dozens out there and you can't just say that they're all second-class (third?) citizens that deserve to get 0wned. 3rd-party appstores are supposed to be a key feature for Android, but they're unsupported entirely by these controls.<p>If you wanted to develop a mobile/embedded platform to bring a new generation of users onto the web and into your customer base, you should have spent about 5 minutes figuring out how to do it without opening them up to harm. Android is the way it is because it wasn't believed these design features (aka safety) couldn't be included in the beginning.",1363235346

And I really just want to know what I'm supposed to do, the bullet points, not really needing the details.<p>Since then I've tried very hard to eat like Wahls suggests.

Seems like you already tried that and it turned into a heated discussion, here is some advice on how to approach it.<p>1. Have the conversation in a public place where professionals meet. For example, coffee shops. If you in the bay area, it would be best to have it in coffee shops known for startup discussions, such as Coupa Coffee in Palo Alto. Just choosing the right place for the conversation will make sure that the discussion does not go out of hand.\n2. Come to the discussion with an open frame of mind. There may be some issues that she is feeling - you should be willing to listen.\n3. Alert her in advance about the general topic you want to talk about. So that she is not surprised and is mentally prepared.\n4. During the discussion, make sure to lay out specific behaviors/situations/examples that you find objectionable, and listen to what she has to say. Again, be open - perhaps there is another piece of the puzzle here that you have thought about fully, and she explains it to you.\nExample: ""I put in 60-70 hours per week"" is a very general statement. A specific statement would be ""Last week, we launched feature F. I did X, Y, Z tasks over night to make the launch successful. However, you contribution over that week was only implementing a simple bug fix B. I would like to listen to you to know how can I help you contribute more to the project.""\n5. You may have some counterpoints to the arguments she makes. Be specific and encourage her to be specific. Hopefully after some time you'll sort it out amicably and you both have a good understanding of how each other works. \n6. Contrary to what others have said, I would not bring a third-party to the discussion. You need to own resolving this problem. Getting third-party involved too quickly can be detrimental - they don't know the situation as much as both of you do. Most problems like these can be solved by honest and open communication.<p>Good luck!",1363235196

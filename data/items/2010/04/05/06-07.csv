1241455,comment,1240307,1240307,0,0,yason,,,"From what I've learned, women <i>use</i> talking to clear out their mind, to reach a conclusion whereas men like to talk only <i>after</i> they're reached a conclusion. This also sets expectations in men and guides how men respond to women.<p>When a person is talking, men expect him to have a point and get there quick. This won't happen when a man is listening to a woman because women talk to find out themselves if there's a point at all. You can guess this can be totally boring for the man if he's stuck with the idea of just waiting and waiting and waiting for the woman to get the point. Soon the man will just learn that the woman's talk never reaches <i>his</i> expectations and stops listening. It's not about physical hearing, it's about mentally filtering out anything she says.<p>Neither approach to talking is wrong, they're just very different.<p>I've made it a point for myself to listen to my wife because I've seen how tremendously important it is for her. I don't expect her to get to a point and I'm not waiting for an interesting issue to be revealed in the end that I can then solve for her. I just listen, nod, make short comments, and what I expect from the discussion is her feeling better instead of a point getting delivered.",1270450662

It taught me all the basics I needed to know -- mostly lingo, since I had no clue what all the TLAs meant.<p>I had just gotten my hands on a few thousand dollars that I knew would otherwise be wasted on an unnecessary purchase, so I signed up with Ameritrade (back in 2004 when it was much less user-friendly) and had to read the book before I felt confident enough to actually place an order.<p>The book advised me to buy what I knew, and to only buy something I planned on holding for a long time.

1241441,comment,1240653,1241163,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> One important thing to point out: functional programming and object-oriented programming aren't necessarily mutually exclusive.<p>I'm not sure that's true.<p>The essence of functional programming is treating a program as evaluating a function without carrying around state, a declarative approach that promotes things like pure functions and referential transparency.<p>The essence of object-oriented programming is passing messages between objects with identity, state and behaviour, an imperative approach and one that fundamentally relies on late binding at run-time.<p>Aren't these styles mutually exclusive?<p>Of course, you can have tools <i>representative</i> of both styles, such as higher order functions and abstract data types, in the same language; the languages you mentioned all do. But whatever merit the resulting hybrid programming style may have, I'm not sure that style is properly called either functional or object-oriented programming.",1270448943

It's not like native apps are fundamentally less capable of UGC than web apps, it's just that the iPad was released, uh, <i>1 day ago</i>.<p>Media companies don't have anything against interactivity, they're just excited about the fact that Apple has had some success creating markets where people actually pay for a la carte content.  The true old-world of limited distribution is certainly not going to come out of the app store—Apple is a gatekeeper yes, but they don't have any interest in enforcing an artificial scarcity on behalf of old media.<p>The hardware limitations are just v1 stuff.  Remember when the iPhone launched without an SDK?  People were shitting cinderblocks all over the blogosphere, but Apple took its time and came out with a killer product in due course.<p>I'm all for open platforms, but the way some of this stuff reads it's like Apple already has achieved a monopoly on general purpose computing with the iPad.  Yes, it's too bad that Apple couldn't have been a little more open with the iPad, but realistically they are innovating more than anyone else in the market.  We should be glad just to have them injecting ideas into the marketplace even if their platform remains fully closed.  It's still better than Microsoft buying and killing anyone with a promising idea, or free software's inability to create a compelling end-user experience.  When Internet usage starts to approach 50% iPad then maybe we have something to worry about, but for now it's just rabid punditry desperate to cash in on the hype.",1270448026

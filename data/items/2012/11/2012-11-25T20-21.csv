I've heard 2 bits/sec before as well.<p>Is this referring to conscious sensations recorded in memory, then maybe I can be warmed up to the idea. Long term memory is definitely spotty, although why can I recall my favorite latest dance track with such precision? The lead, bass, kick, clap and atmospherics themselves must compose more than 16 bits/sec.<p>What about what is processed by the unconscious, to be remembered later? Like when you didn't notice something at the time, but in the future something sparks your memory to remember it. Does the unconscious (that can become conscious) operate on a separate port with its own bandwidth?<p>But consciously? I strictly, abhorrently refuse. This music is FLAC, baby.<p>On the other hand, if it is true, then maybe our brain's compression algorithms are insane. Maybe we process sensations in relation to all our past sensation - I hear only the unique parts of this epic bassline, but the data contains pointers to all the basslines I've heard before, turning my consciousness into a complex amalgam of current and past. Then a two-hour movie in 22.5 kilobytes could make sense.",1353877099

It actually affects the company as a whole more than you might think.  Heavily marketed consumer-focused companies never seem to stop marketing themselves.  Even in the cafeteria, you're bombarded with the marketing about how this is the best company EVAR and all the cool people are here, etc.  Sales is more about relationships and building trust.

Part is because Python3 is the only language my kids know, and I'd like to get them involved in some of what I do.<p>I would consider Django if there were good resources, such as an edition of this book, that taught Django as a Python3 web framework. I don't know enough about Django to know what's reasonable, but if the Django community updates this book from Python-1998 to Python-2005 then my kids and I will check it out--when it goes on display in the Computer History Museum.<p>But if it is reasonable to aim the next edition of this book at pure Python3, I might be interested.

But, whether you like it or not, it's not okay (in public, at least) to make statements which link gender, race, etc., with competence.<p>No fair, you (or some other reader) might say. I'm just reporting my observations. But I claim that you have a responsibility to do more than simply report your observations, and it's because people are stupid.

4829169,comment,4828146,4828511,4,0,sgk284,,,"The problem comes in when you want to write a search function for the game tree. Your search function will make assumptions about how the tree is constructed, i.e. assuming that the children can be produced given only the current board and player, which isn't true for all games.<p>Your search function will wind up actually having two responsibilities, that is 1) creating the tree and 2) traversing/searching the tree. If you want to do anything else, like add pruning functions (maximum depth, for example), then your search function will also wind up having to manage that.<p>The problem is, a search algorithm such as breadth-first or A* really has no reason to need know any of those things. If you passed the search function a pre-computed tree already pruned (i.e. capped at a max-depth) the resultant search function would do one thing: search. It would have no need to prune or compute the tree, as that was already taken care of.<p>This lets you re-use that search function for many other use-cases, rather than tailoring it to a specific game or use-case. In a lazy language, you can pass the search function an infinite tree, and the search function doesn't need to know that it is infinite. It can treat it just as though it's already been computed. Similarly, you can do the same thing with pruning the tree before passing it to the search function.<p>The end result is that rather than having to intertwine all of these unrelated concepts (generating the data structure, pruning the data structure, and searching the data structure), a lazy language makes it extremely natural (and in fact the default) to write programs where these building blocks are separate entities that can be composed with other pieces of code.<p>Hopefully that helps make sense of why laziness is a requirement for truly modular code. Note that you can always emulate lazy evaluation with closures (or often, simply using generators), but it's never as natural as just having it be built into the language by default.",1353875096

In Japanese, she uses the same word for fate (unmei) twice, one instance of which being the first word of the sentence. This is to lend the sentence some kind of parallel structure. Even given the flipping idiocy of the moment, it makes for a neat little verbal-ironic turnaround: The only way to change your fate is to go forth and meet it. In other words, the only way Snake can possibly outlive his terrible fate (death) is by running straight at it, instead of letting it crash into him while he sits there doing nothing. This is a nice little sentence that no doubt has already inspired several dozen fanfiction-writing Japanese fourteen-year-olds. In English, its a dud; the translator must have majored in newspaper journalism, had a professor tell him to never use the same word  even (ESPECIALLY) the  twice in one sentence. However, this isnt reporting  this isnt regurgitation of earthquake statistics. Its art (term used loosely). The moral of the story is that theres no concept of the word it in Japanese, which is why so many sentences resort to (eventually poetic) repetition. We mustnt forget this  this is perhaps one of the keys of Kojimas artistic conscience, here, seriously (okay, not so seriously).</i>",1353874661

All my life, in every classroom I've ever been in from pre-school through university, there was inevitably a significant portion of every class that always had this attitude along the lines of ""ugh, I hate school. School sucks. I slept through this class and I'm proud of it"". And I always wondered why they felt that way (especially in college considering they didn't have to be there) because I personally always loved school and learning.<p>This attitude comes from taking education for granted. We don't know what it's like to be without it and so we don't appreciate it. Those kids in Ethiopia aren't getting the simplest lessons that we get here in the states and they're probably seeing some people who do habe some education and they see what kind of opportunities come with knowledge and so they desperately want it and try to teach themselves.<p>Not having an education makes seeing those who have one very differently. I'm sure those Ethiopian kids envy anyone who can do simple multiplication or read a book. Because we can't even imagine not having those things we think they're basic entitlements like running water or the air we breathe. That's why, in my opinion, Americsn kids have no interest in learning while kids in underdeveloped nations want it badly enough to teach themselves.",1353874610

At least, that's what the Raspberry Pi foundation was pushing as the reason.<p>The GPIO pins and the fairly fast gpu for video rendering were secondary things.<p>The Raspberry Pi somehow or other really caught the zeitgeist at the right time.  It isn't the only kid on the block doing what it is doing, even when you consider price, but it is by far the most widely known and thus there are huge network effects that make it a good device to be tinkering with.<p>This situation is quite similar to smaller microcontrollers where in the minds of many people that whole segment has become nearly synonymous with the Arduino despite the fact that there are many other options, some of them just as capable but far cheaper (eg. TI's MSP430 which you can buy for less than 5 bucks) and some about the same price but far more powerful.<p>Of course, once all the software, tutorials and/or hardware ""shields"" crop up for the mind-share winner, that platform certainly becomes the most convenient to hack on and then that popularity feeds on itself.

There are unique cases where each is better than the other but I cannot see one overtaking the other. At best I think online education could become almost equal to traditional education but never a more popular or better option.<p>Consider those living in countries where web access is still rare or slow or a challenge to access. Online education isn't viable for these people though it may be in the future.<p>There is no substitute for being educated in the presence of a professor and a room full of students. You could email, IM, video conference, or voice call all day long but web based education takes a bit of the humanity out of the whole experience and it's importance should not be underestimated. Online education makes things more rigid in some ways. An instructor prepares lessons as usual, teaches, then receives feedback from students in the form of questions and their scores on assignments and tests just like usual but theres an advantage to being present in a room full of students. That advantage is that it is far easier to tell if students are catching on and if one or more students are struggling to understand certain concepts then it's easier to sort of improvise and immediately find out and address the cause of any sort of problem.<p>Individual attention suffers with online learning. You can still give individual attention but for many, having someone there makes all the difference.<p>That said, there are just as many benefits to online learning and I have to say, I don't believe one is better than the other, just that they're different and that I don't think either will become endangered any time soon.<p>As someone who went to but did not finish a prestigious university, I think online education should only be sought out in certain circumstances. The experiences you have when attending a traditional university are priceless and cannot be had online. Those experiences aren't part of any curriculum but are an important part of forming the person you will become after graduation. Online education seems, at least to me, better for those needing a cheaper alternative to traditional education. Also those who are unable to physically attend a university due to, again, cost constraints, or their location would also seem to be a good fit as well as those folks who are older, need a more flexible schedule, have difficulty learning in a classroom, and others.<p>I've dome online and traditional education. They compliment each other well and both offer certain things the other doesn't but given the hypothetical choice of choosing all of one and none of the other, I'd take the traditional experience any day.<p>The web is the most incredible thing that's happened to us since the Enlightenment probably but it isn't the cure to all mankind's ills. Online education is certainly a viable alternative to a traditional education but I still don't see it being able to rival or outmatch a traditional education. There are intangibles that come with a traditional education that have no on,one counterpart. So I doubt traditional schools have anything to fear and truly hope they don't.",1353874099

Strict laws govern auto insurance coverage, liability, and claims.  These laws vary by state.  This means that accidents by a renter <i>can</i> affect no-claim policies in many states.<p>Second, as others have noted--cars are easy theft targets.  Homes are not, and aside from a few high-dollar items like TVs or computers, neither are the contents of most homes.  Assuming that FlightCar is able to find an insurer willing to cover this theft risk, the policy would <i>start</i> in the millions just for California-level coverage.<p>Finally, asset seizures are a far bigger problem with cars than with homes.  A car used to transport drugs can be seized by the authorities and impounded.  The laws are very generous to the authorities for drug-related asset seizures.  For purposes of drug-related asset seizure laws, if a person is driving a car with permission of the owner (i.e., even as a rental), their actions are imputed to the owner for purposes of justifying seizure.  (This maxim has been tested repeatedly in the courts.)  In other words: if a renter transports drugs, gets caught, and your car gets seized, you're SOL.  Insurers don't cover this at the personal level; even if they provide coverage to a business like FlightCar the policy would be prohibitively expensive.",1353873902

So the only way a U.S. based company can sponsor your visa is if they offer you a job and claim that owing to the fact that you are highly skilled labor of whom there is a shortage, they absolutely need you. As part of this, you basically have to have degrees.<p>Now, Tim Van Damme is an interesting case. As you said, I am not sure he has any of these degrees.

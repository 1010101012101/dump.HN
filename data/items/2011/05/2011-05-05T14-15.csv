</code></pre>
That's a good question.  Off-hand, I would say that part of the reason has to do with experience.  Humans have been constructing bridges and buildings for thousands of years.  As such, engineering of this sort is generally well understood.  Occasionally, when working with new materials or grander scales, past experience fails, e.g. Tacoma Narrows Bridge.<p>There is another important way that designing software differs from designing structures.  Whether a building stands or collapses is governed by the laws of physics.  On the other hand, software design takes place in an entirely abstract world, where the laws that govern it are sometimes subject to change.  That combined with the sheer scale of much software makes it difficulty to thoroughly reason about it.",1304607297

Ranking things in order of preference is not hard for anyone to do. The finer points of the difference in electoral outcomes given different voting statistics might be more sophisticated, but that could be applied to any of the voting systems.<p>Voting itself though is no more complicated saying ""I'll have  a pint of Stella. If they don't have Stella, I'll have Fosters.""<p>The No campaign has made the AV system out to be more complicated than it is as a scare tactic to put people off voting for it. That seems to have worked, which is deeply unfortunate, but indicative of political campaigns across the world. Fear and doubt are excellent motivators, and seem to be far more effective than a clear, reasoned and 'intellectual' argument.<p>Call me an unrealistic idealist, but I would much rather people research and consider the options before making an informed choice. Making a case for FPTP because it encourages more people who are uninformed and unconsidered to vote isn't going to win me over, though :)<p>However, as I say, the AV voting mechanism really isn't complicated at all - my wife is an early years teacher. Voting under an AV system is so easy that - literally - a five-year-old can understand it. I don't see anyone being put off by it.<p>Moreover, I think more people will be enthused by i) their ability to vote for the candidate that they believe in, ii) the greater accountability of their elected MPs to engage with their constituents and more accurately reflect their views and iii) their ability to express their opinions in a more meaningful way through the ballot box, that turnouts would be greater, not smaller.
Low turnout and voter apathy has a multitude of causes, but the ones that I hear most often are ""lack of accountability"" and ""my vote doesn't count anyway.""",1304607295

High energy physics at CERN is the same as Climatology is the same as people who interpreted those reverse-causality ESP results as something other than a statistical anomaly.<p>Of course, some skepticism can be used to separate these three classes even for the layperson. The wiser layperson looks for articles on journal websites that they don't want to buy, looks for credentials from known universities, looks for something that sounds sciencey instead of new agey. These policies definitely can improve your capacity to learn from digested scientific material.<p>But if you interpret this power as roughly knowing how to interpret and trust scientists, which is probably a fair description of the actors in a lot of lay science argumentation (or politics in general), then you can quickly get out of your depth without others or even yourself noticing.<p>---<p>I think the article does a good job conveying the idea of scientific doubt.

When scientific knowledge is passed on to an increasingly lay audience, it should be known that this is the best guess a room full of really smart, dedicated people could get at.

Focusing on investment banks (I assume you have no problem justifying the existence of retail banks and insurers, the other two giant topics in financial services), what they do is effectively make the allocation of capital more efficient.<p>Without efficient capital allocation, most enterprise becomes extremely difficult. Without banks, there would be no stock market. There would be no way for companies to raise large sums of money to grow faster. There would be no one keeping markets liquid, which would encourage people to stick their money under the mattress rather than invest it. There would be no way for startups to exit, and so there would be no VCs, and no angels either (or at least, much more limited ones, making maybe one or two investments to help out a friend). All of this would massively reduce the amount of capital available to work with, and decimate the business world.<p>Now, you might take the view that ""you don't need capital to do business"", but that's just a very limited viewpoint that applies in very narrow circumstances, like some small percentage of internet startups. Almost all businesses need capital to get started. There's a good reason why microloans are so successful - they provide capital that helps enterprise. Think of the banking system as an equivalent of microloans for people who need more than $100 (for example, because they need to design and sell new products, build new factories, buy stock, make strategic acquisitions, etc).",1304605784

Then, given that Chrome (which maintains its own DNS cache-- a decidedly not absurd caching behavior, I acknowledge) is my browser of choice, I also set out to fix it so I didn't need to restart Chrome.

delay .5

In this regard software is the ultimate engineering.  Once you have the blueprint (the final source code), stamping out copies is perfectly reproducible.  The program applies to many more environments than a skyscraper design.<p>On the other hand, designing a skyscraper is alot like writing software.  The designer doesn't know what the building will look like.  There is an iterative process where ideas are thrown around, design errors identified and fixed, etc.<p>In terms of quality measurements, the same measurements don't apply to software since each copy is a perfect replica.   There is little need to measure how closely a copy reproduces the design, it is often perfect.  The design may have flaws, but so may a building design.<p>Having said this though, it sure seems that software is alot more unreliable than most bridges and buildings, so the question is, ""Why?""",1304605120

But, of course, this is not what people do.""<p>The problem is that it's trivially easy to find MAJOR errors in the methodology or interpretation of many or even most journal articles, and whatever passes for the scientific consensus is usually based directly off a very shallow reading of the abstracts and conclusions of these articles without taking any of their flaws into account, let alone questioning the epistemology behind them. There are probably fields where this isn't true, but they're definitely the minority. When the scientific consensus changes it's rarely because of brilliant new research, but rather because the flaws in old research gradually get publicized and so the old conclusions get replaced by the conclusions of new research that's also flawed, but where the flaws aren't yet widely known. But there's no reason why you can't actually figure out what these flaws are, it's not difficult at all, it's just that most people (including scientists) are too lazy to read the actual papers and think critically about them.<p>The point is that people who buy into scientific consensus wholesale aren't actually the rational skeptics they market themselves as being, but rather are just as dumb and ignorant as the worst of the religious fundamentalists.",1304604944

3276256,comment,3275179,3275179,3,0,mkramlich,,,"Autism sounds like truly a bad thing, truly a disease or bad health condition. But some of what the psychology profession considers to be in the autism ""range"", like Asperger's, instead sounds an awful lot to me like someone who's just smart and intellectual, and actually has a better/higher-functioning mind, than the average person. This would seem to be borne out by the fact that these ""conditions"" are more prevalent in scientists, engineers and their children. From my perspective, yes, people who have a much more powerful mind, greater analytical abilities, people who can think visually, three-dimensionally, hyper-logically, etc. are going to sound/look/act strange to people who don't do these things and don't have these abilities. But that doesn't mean it's bad. Or rather, it doesn't mean the ""strange"" person has something wrong or non-ideal about them -- it may be the ""normal"" person who's defective or non-ideal.",1322197065

We would all be better off.<p>But the truth of the matter is, for a lot of people there are two choices after high school:<p>A - Pay $[bignum] for education that has high employability and will give them the knowledge and qualifications necessary to find work, which is absolutely necessary if they ever hope to repay said debt.<p>B - Pay $[bignum] for education that has low employability and will <i>not</i> give them any of the qualifications sought for in in-demand jobs. They will still owe $[bignum] which will compromise all other aspects of their lives.<p>I see your line of argument a lot whenever this topic comes up. My challenge to you is: besides a lot of feel-good platitudes, how will your system <i>work</i>? How will people feed themselves, clothe themselves, and put a roof over their head - their head full of wonderful perspectives and understanding but no job?<p>The ""we can all get comprehensive"" education idea died when education became expensive. It died when globalization squeezed the American middle class to become more desperate and ever more critically reliant on continued employment. Far from being the norm, the age of comprehensive college education was a brief blip in thousands of years of human civilization lasting no more than a few decades. The gravy train has come to a full and complete stop, and it's time for industrialized nations to clue into something: life is tough. You scramble to survive. High-minded ideology comes second to the survival of yourself and your loved ones.<p>If, in this topsy-turvy struggle you can find time to fit in a comprehensive education. Good for you - you won.

3276200,comment,3275869,3276068,5,0,abhimishra,,,"> If the objective is to create well-rounded, cross-disciplinary citizens, then no, that is a horrible idea.<p>Why is it that everyone thinks a STEM education means you are automatically not well-rounded or cross-disciplinary? There are universities with STEM programs that mitigate this problem successfully by creating the right requirements for the degree.<p>As an example, the requirements for breadth were FAR more stringent at my university for technical fields than for the humanities/social sciences. The 'science' breadth requirement for a humanities major could be satisfied by first-semester courses like the introductory Nutritional Science course, but the breadth requirements for technical majors required that students end up taking at least a couple 3rd/4th year courses in liberal arts fields (which in turn had lower-level prerequisites, naturally). This resulted in the inverse problem from my POV, whereby the majors generally assumed to create well-rounded students actually failed to do so.<p>Furthermore, being well-rounded is a lot more than what you study in college IMO. A well-rounded citizen has to continually invest in 'upkeep' that earns them that label.  The most well-rounded folks I know read throughout their life (often across a broad set of topics), continually invest in their education on their own time through this reading, keep up on current-events, and so forth. I don't see a lack of liberal arts education precluding these activities or any other activities that might contribute to being well-rounded.<p>> And why can't someone get both a liberal arts education and a ""practical"" education?<p>I generally agree that this would be ideal, but it is also constrained by how much money we have as a society. Remember - you and I are contributing our own funds indirectly to subsidize this same education, and it is certainly not cheap these days (see other comments on cost of education). The trick of course is to strike the right balance and realize a good return on that educational investment. Personally, I can see value in something like a Minor in a field that is completely different than one's Major, but I don't see the benefit being much greater if one were to get two full degrees.",1322194888

China is a communist country of the Cold War mold, if not in all the particulars, then at least in some of its centralist, autocratic ways. Communist countries of this type have outright told people what they should study, to fill particular state needs. That there is freedom to choose in China is a sign of course that this is 2011, not 1970, but still... it makes this kind of thing not at all shocking.",1322194788

The truth is if you looked at the advancement of any modern superpower you will see nothing but the same kinds of flaws. I'm not saying this kind of crude, unstoppable progress is a good thing.. but passing it as something that's just part of the Chinese mentality is probably a poor representation of the true values of the culture as a whole.",1322194669

3276185,comment,3275869,3276021,1,0,Jach,,,"The problem is people complect education with college, most egregiously in the private sector with companies requiring BS/BA degrees to do any job (and reasonably above minimal wage). In the US, most education is free or nearly so, especially in the humanities, if you're willing to do it on your own. College on the other hand is obscenely expensive, both in opportunity costs as well as the actual loans and so on. In order to combat that expense, you should have ""something to show for it"" that's applicable in the job market when you're done. The purpose of college has become making money, via getting that piece of paper, social connections, etc. If you sign up for a liberal arts degree priced at $100k, you're doing a bad job at making money (and a pretty bad job at educating depending on where you go--even with Computer Science if you pick a bad school you could have learned everything and more in 1 year that the school took 4 years to teach you). Since you're doing a bad job, you should be mocked in the way a person whose goal is to profit in a yard sale and who ends up paying people to take stuff away, should be mocked.",1322194330

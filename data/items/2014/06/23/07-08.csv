7930710,comment,7928968,7930584,1,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"> The goal was to come up with a good regular expression to validate URLs in user input, and not to match any URL that browsers can handle (as per the URL Standard).<p>WTF? What is &quot;validation&quot; supposed to be good for if it doesn&#x27;t actually validate what it claims to? Exactly this mentality of making up your own stuff instead of implementing standards is what causes all these interoperability nightmares! If you claim to accept URLs, then accept URLs, all URLs, and reject non-URLs, all non-URLs. There is no reason to do anything else, other than lazyness maybe, and even then you are lying if you claim that you are validating URLs - you are not. If you say you accept a URL, and I paste a URL, your software is broken if it then rejects that URL as invalid.<p>This does not apply to intentionally selecting only a subset of URLs that are applicable in a given context, of course - if the URL is to be retrieved by an HTTP client, it&#x27;s perfectly fine to reject non-HTTP URLs, of course, but any kind of &quot;nobody is going to use that anyhow&quot; is not a good reason. In particular, that kind of rejection most certainly is something that should not happen in the parser as that is likely to give inconsistent results as the parser usually works at the wrong level of abstraction.<p>> The RFC does not reflect reality either (which, ironically, is what you seem to be complaining about).<p>Well, or reality does not match the RFC?<p>> If you’re looking for a spec-compliant solution, the spec to follow is <a href=""http://url.spec.whatwg.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://url.spec.whatwg.org/</a>.<p>A spec for a formal language that doesn&#x27;t contain a grammar? The world is getting crazier every day ...<p>> That doesn’t mean there aren’t any situations in which I need/want to blacklist some technically valid URL constructs.<p>Yeah, but blocking IPv4 literals of certain address ranges seems like a stupid idea nonetheless. Good software should accept any input that is meaningful to it and that is not a security problem. And as I said above, such rejection most certainly should not happen in the parser.",1403509960

This is what the author is doing in the conclusion; suggesting that because he&#x27;s found one or two studies that go against the grain, that the side those studies oppose are equally poorly researched.<p>Yes, it is difficult to measure, I absolutely agree. But the author could still have made his point without resorting to spin-doctoring. He is suggesting that the line of reasoning is valid and plausible - and it&#x27;s not, because he&#x27;s heavily misrepresenting the data in that first case. If that was his point - that some studies heavily misrepresent the data like that - then he should have exposed studies instead of repeating the process as a counterpoint.<p>In any case, this is a line from his conclusion: <i>the laboratory experiments that experimental exposure to violence causes people to play contrived games in a more aggressive manner couldn’t catch that in the real world, violent movies decrease crime</i>. He&#x27;s taken this blip from blockbuster opening weekends and taken it as gospel in his rationale. &quot;Because violent people like to go see a movie with everyone else, and they don&#x27;t do more crimes later on to &#x27;catch up&#x27;, violent movies do not increase violent behaviour&quot;. It&#x27;s a really naive view of the argument around violent movies and violence in the public, that it only has short-term effects measured in weeks, yet he&#x27;s using it in his conclusion (not just in his &#x27;case studies&#x27;).<p>By &quot;couldn’t catch that in the real world, violent movies decrease crime&quot;, the author has clearly taken that faulty interpretation of the study as an overarching truth - even after saying that both sides of the story are &#x27;plausible and intuitive&#x27;, he&#x27;s still declared that &#x27;what happens in the real world&#x27; is based on the misrepresentation of his study.

Some of them take the form, &quot;This coin will produce <some specific output> in the next 1000 typical flips&quot;. That hypothesis and others with similar, more complex form, like the pair of hypotheses that predict flip 1001 after the same first 1000, GAIN CREDENCE when you perform 1000 flips that conform to them. Others of the similar form lose it.  Other hypotheses of wildly different construction, like, that a coin is more or less fair, lose and gain credence according to whether or not they predict the observed result.<p>The fact that you didn&#x27;t write a hypothesis down before you did the test has very little to do with whether or not the data supports the hypothesis. Hindsight bias matters, but only as far as it corrupts your experience.

Something like Scala doesn't have the ambiguity that a C or JavaScript program has without line terminators.<p>So semicolon insertion is just a hack that happens before parsing.  It's not that the semicolons are optional, they aren't, but it puts them in automatically according to a set of rules.  Unfortunately that means you can't just put a return on a line by itself -- a semicolon will always be inserted.",1257213514

I think the first thing you are going to run into is a need to visually differentiate a non-vote from a zero. I'm also not sure what problem it's trying to solve.<p>What I would find more useful (from a 'build a better recommendations engine' perspective) is a 5+:  a short list of favorites that can stand in for someone's favorites.  Personally, I'd also like a better way to better differentiate the gradations between standard, good, and great. Whether I hate something or 'hate-hate' it isn't going to make much of a difference.  Do you think your audience is going to be persuaded to reduce their average rating by a point, or are you still going to find the oft-quoted 4.3 average?  I'm doubtful, but this doesn't make it a a bad idea to try.<p>As to the downvote, I stand by it.  My goal is to rearrange the page so that the comments that are most useful to me are at the top.  If others find your comment useful, they will see the injustice and bring it back up to the top.<p>As to the need for 'strong backing', I think we just have different worldviews.

The characters aren't bound by the same laws of physics that you and I are. When characters make decisions, the other characters react in the way the author wants, but real people may not react that way.<p>With nonfiction, there are rules.  With fiction, there are no rules.  In fact, you don't know <i>what</i> the rules are when you read fiction.<p>You know that quote about those who don't read history are doomed to repeat it?  Well, there is a lot of history to read.<p>They're two different universes.  One, fiction, is framed in a universe where we don't exist.  The other, nonfiction, is in the same universe we all share here. In fiction, what goes up may not come down.  If you shape your life or make decisions based on fictional ideas, they don't always apply in the real world.  Sometimes they may, but mostly they do not.<p>Yes, you are right, lots of insights can be gained from fiction.  I learned a lot reading slaughterhouse five. It's fiction, but it's also pretty real in a way.  I learned a lot from 1984.  I learn a lot from science fiction.<p>But there are is also a lot to learn and a lot of insights to be gained from nonfiction as well.  Truth is stranger than fiction.<p>Think of it this way.  If you <i>only</i> read fiction for the rest of your life, could you program a computer?  Could you build a house? Could you understand quantum mechanics or any myriad other practical skills?  Probably not.<p>This of course is my <i>opinion</i>, but if I had to choose between a future life of only fiction reading or a future life of only nonfiction reading, I would choose nonfiction.  I think nonfiction is a better learning tool and a greater benefit to my life than fiction, because through nonfiction, I can learn facts that I can't learn through fiction.  It's actually difficult and confusing sometimes to decipher truth from fiction.",1257213035

You should probably also offer some deal like 3 for $20 or 5 for $30, because this will <i>greatly</i> increase your average customer value.  (Your median number of books purchased is going to be 1, otherwise.  Trust me -- nature of the beast.)  After you've convinced folks $7 is the price for a book (too low, but we'll roll with it), and they've committed to spending $7, it is very easy to convince them to spend another $13 to save a buck.<p>Another reason you'll like this: cash flow.  You see, many people are going to buy 3/5 book credits and record 1 (or 0) books.  This means that you're sitting on their money in the interim.  Depending on your local accounting rules, that can probably be booked as revenue (and can almost certainly be spent on expenses) today.  Also, since they haven't picked a book off the shelf yet, I'm guessing you don't owe any royalties on the $13 which pays for books that haven't been recorded.  (Check your contracts/legal advisors.)<p>(Some folks might be discomfitted by this advice since you may think the business is getting money for nothing.  That isn't correct: they're just getting money <i>in advance of</i> doing something of value for the customer, <i>in consideration of</i> giving the customer a break on the ultimate price.<p>This is similar to how a shareware business sells you a license today which includes technical support six months down the road, rather than selling you a cheaper license today and charging a high per-incident fee later.  We don't think the shareware vendor is being dishonest because the support hasn't been delivered yet, or because it may never be delivered.)",1257212120

The darts so far have landed on ""No"" or ""Play Golf"".<p><a href=""http://www.s2999.com/images/dartboard_decision_maker.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.s2999.com/images/dartboard_decision_maker.jpg</a><p>""Apple decided not to sell them."" is not a reason, it's an effect of a long line of decision making. The first part of your statement is missing. ""Netbooks _____, so Apple decided not to sell them"". Fill in the blank with something that makes business sense and you'll probably be not too far off the mark. You have offered absolutely 0 to the analysis of why Apple is not in this space.<p>My point, since you have failed to deduce it, is that I think Apple couldn't make their margin goals on that product line (netbooks). They sell for between $300-400. Apple's absolutely bottom of the barrel offering is $500 with no peripherals whatsoever. Margins on netbooks are pitiful, probably close to break even. Apple wants to sell commodity hardware at 20% markup, they can't do that in the netbook space. Common, this is Business and Products 101.<p>I can see no other rational business reason not to get into that space. There may be one, but I don't see it. You are certainly not offering a compelling analysis.<p>It introduces a product gap that their analysis should have spotted but they were willing to chance. The effect of that product gap is that <i>something</i> filled the hole via consumer demand and that was either:\na) People bought vanilla netbooks and ""suffered"" with XP.\nb) People bought netbooks and turned them into hackintoshes.<p>Either way, Apple didn't realize revenue from these purchases. Smart business would have tried to capitalize on this form factor, which is why every major manufacturer other than Apple has some kind of netbook offering. My claim is that this is an oversight on the part of Apple. Sure they wouldn't have realized revenue from these sales, but they would have kept their consumers ""in the fold"" since netbooks are usually a second purchase.<p>Apple's response so far has not been to fill the hole in the product line with a product (even an overpriced one), but by crippling their software.<p>It's a scorched earth policy, if they can't have the consumer's money, nobody can.",1257211986

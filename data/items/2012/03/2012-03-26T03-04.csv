I'd rather do something else with that money...<p>Any internship/co-op I get HAS to be in a city, because I am not willing to get a car.

High end hardware companies are starting to realize that things like barcraft are becoming more common, and are capitalizing on the number of viewers. It's a slow start, but esports will likely follow the same pattern modern day sporting events take. A lot of the current difficulty is that video games are not designed for people who are just watching. This is changing pretty drastically right now. Valve is working heavily in making sure that the engine for Dota 2 isn't just good for playing the game, but also for broadcasting it. They're building a very robust platform for viewing, announcing, sponsoring, and filming in game actions. Once broadcasting is efficient, the larger number of views will bring in heavier sponsors.

Satisficing is focusing on the minimum requirements to reach your goal.<p>Never finishing seems to be a combination of maximizing when you don't need to bother, and also failing to identify the true <i>requirements</i> for you.

For example, programming competition books like Programming Challenges[1] forces students to solve real-world-ish problems according to performance constraints - a time constraint, either artificial (e.g., problem statement requires execution within 2 seconds) or actual (e.g., choosing an algorithm that is too slow means the sun will burn out before the algorithm terminates).<p>Books and contests of this nature teach algorithmic <i>thinking</i>, which is far more important than the actual algorithms themselves. It also provides a context for implementing these algorithms, which means the student gets to see the more practical aspects as well: testing it on corner cases, fighting with the chosen implementation language, relying on compiler optimization, etc.<p>If the goal of the undergraduate program is to develop practitioners of computer science, or even graduates headed for academia, algorithmic thinking is essential. I don't think CLRS is necessarily the best way to teach that, and it certainly isn't the only way.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.programming-challenges.com/pg.php?page=index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.programming-challenges.com/pg.php?page=index</a>",1332732112

I was going to qualify that, but no, I think it's pretty unequivocal.<p>Also, your selection of companies seems a bit deceptive. These companies' profit strategies are very narrowly focused on the one market where it's possible to make money with free software — and even that isn't really making money from the software. You have to be in a market where people will pay through the nose for support contracts, because the software itself isn't making much money.<p>The one real exception I can think of is Mozilla, which makes decent money off of Firefox. Otherwise, unfortunately, it does generally seem to be necessary to bind the users enough to make them pay you for the software. (That's not a sarcastic ""unfortunately"" — I do think it would be great if I could reasonably sell free software as profitably as non-free software, but I don't see any evidence that it's feasible.)",1271818647

It does include the years of classes, not just the research years, but classes are usually only two full-time years or so (less if you got a master's first).<p>It's quite possible to do it in less, if things go right, though in the areas of CS I'm familiar with doing it in under 5 is a stretch (maybe if you're doing a pure theory thesis). But often things don't go right. Lots of people end up writing their PhD on their 2nd or 3rd project, not their first, either because it turned out not to interest them or turned out to be fatally flawed. Or they end up having to switch advisors for reasons ranging from personality clashes to the advisor leaving their university.<p>Things can also go faster or slower depending on how funding goes. The ideal is to be funded on a grant or fellowship to do your own research full-time. Less ideal is being funded on a grant to do something other than your research, often code-monkey implementation for some big DARPA project or something, which means you basically have a separate part-time job; or if you're supported by TAing, that's a different kind of part-time job.",1271818145
1281260,comment,1281100,1281175,0,0,pguerin,,,"Yep, the book ""Presentation Zen"" says pretty much all there is to know about this approach. And while it is not a silver bullet, it's great! I also find not using a power point at all easier too. You can connect more easily with the audience, make it more personnal, and do crazy body language movements because they will look at you instead of your slides. Sure, a good presentation can improve the message, but it's harder (chance of de-sync your speech and slides).<p>As for not using notes, it can be hard but possible. If you practice enough to master your speech, then yes you can go without notes. Anyway, it's no big deal when you speak about something you are passionnate about! You just need to speak at a correct speed (as for me, I need to slow down! a lot!).",1271818089

Generally if there is bug it's pretty easy for most to determine if it's the front or back end that messed up, and yet the customer blames EVERYTHING on the front end.  It's not their fault either - they just aren't aware of our architecture, and probably never stopped to think about it, nor should they have to.<p>Keeping this in mind, you need to have a reliable back end, and a functional, presentable front end.  The GUI doesn't have to be anything spectacular, just well organized so things make sense.  Take this website for example - nothing fancy about this GUI.  However, do spend some time making it organized and easy to use since that's what everyone will see.  Worst case scenario, hire a designer from a local community college or elance.<p>Here's some general tips to make your GUI more presentable:
1.  Form fields should line up, and generally they should be the same size.  Don't have some indented and others not.
2.  Try to keep your forms balanced across the page/screen.  Scrolling down forever sucks, so distribute placement evenly.  Similarly, horizontal scrolling also sucks so avoid that as well.
3.  Try to keep user inputs to a minimum.  People are lazy.
4.  Use colors that work together.  When in doubt, leave it black and white.  Check out <a href=""http://www.colorschemer.com/online.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.colorschemer.com/online.html</a>
5.  Use colors as indicators.  Green = success, red = failure
6.  Be consistent.<p>If you want to read an awesome book about designing GUIs try  Smashing Magazine's book:  www.smashingbook.com",1271816784

  - Mark Twain<p>-----<p>At 12 years old my sister and I were ""off the dole"" as my parents put it.  No more allowance, which had topped out at $2.75/wk.  If we wanted money, we were expected to use our heads.  We ended up mowing lawns, gardening and shoveling after having my mom introduce us to the neighborhood.<p>At 14 I wanted a computer to mess around with.  That's fine, but the family computer wasn't for that.  I went with some juniors and seniors in the computer club to dumpster dive behind businesses, or sometimes to the dump itself.  Ended up with a working stack of 386s to put FreeBSD and Linux on.<p>I had a part-time job at 15 to save for a car, because at 16 we were told we were going to be on foot.  At 16 I used to take on contract work that one of my teachers had to pass up, doing web-development.  Mostly PHP, ColdFusion and some Classic ASP.  Two of those sites, 12 years later, are still running just fine on the custom CMS built for their needs.<p>I had partial scholarships to top tech schools, but the debt load of going to CMU or WPI was still approaching that of a home mortgage where I grew up.  I had saved enough money to go to state school and pay cash.  Yet when I got there, I was completely underwhelmed.  Bored out of my mind.  There was very little I would learn until my 3rd or 4th years, they didn't end up applying AP course credit to get me out of 10x courses, and the social environment was akin to drunken day care (and I didn't need to be on campus to make new friends or go on dates).  After 3 semesters I ended up in the Vice Chancellor's office with my parents having a very long, very candid discussion about the pros and cons of me sticking it out.  They're weren't paying for it, but they were livid at the idea of me dropping out.  Long story short, no one could punch a hole in my argument and I even managed to get a partial refund for the 3rd semester.  I had until the end of the week to pack up and move out.<p>I'll go back eventually for a proper engineering degree when I'm bored building trading systems for investment firms.<p>Point is, nothing like being stuck with a dilemma (no more allowance, so unless you want a video game, we expect you to find a way to make money) and being forced to work out a solution at the ripe old age of 12.  I learned more about how to further myself in my free time than I ever did through some state-mandated curriculum.<p>Would I recommend this exact approach to everyone?  Absolutely not.  Yet there's always a playing field everyone can succeed on, and there's an immense amount of value in kids finding that out for themselves with a bit of guidance.",1271816440

There is no need to imprison (as Stallman would say) the user and disrespect his rights (at least to use, understand, improve) in order to be commercial. What ""Gates et al"" have done is to bind their users through the software they use to manage their lives and jobs, ensuring long-term prosperity through technological dependency.<p>The folks at Red Hat, Canonical and MindTouch (just to name a few I have in my head right now) are every bit as serious as Microsoft when it comes to be commercial and to be paid for their work.<p>The main difference being they show much more consideration towards their users and customers.",1271816087

I realize everyone has their own personal choice of tools and services to make their daily life easier, and my hope is that you'll share it. Of course, there are several definitions of what might be considered ""productive"" so I offer this:<p>1. Handling email from various sources (personal, work, client emails, etc). Do you use Gmail for archiving? Outlook only? Other?<p>2. Handling development work between several languages and development suites. EDIT (for clarification): For example, running different development environments inside virtual machines or doing all dev related work in the host OS? (And consequently, having all dev related tools installed on the host OS such as visual studio, debuggers, compilers, multiple browsers, etc.)<p>3. Handling social websites, services, and IM.<p>4. Handling media, both local and remote (streaming via web or otherwise). Displaying media to a television.<p>5. Your backup solution. Offite? Local? To a web service?<p>6. In general, do you prefer cloud based services or doing everything locally? If local is your thing, how do you reconcile multiple machines (phone, desktop, laptop)?<p>Feel free to pick any or all of the above to share. I am highly interested in learning what software and services create the best productive experience for you.<p>Thanks

The CTO also acts as an interface between wildly different parts of an organization. Again on this example, I may have a doctor on staff who tests our software and helps set requirements, but is not part of engineering. The CTO should be able to capture those needs and build them into the final product vision the VPE will then set about building.<p>A VPE on the other hand should understand technology really well, but also understand all of the management considerations necessary to actually ""build"" the thing. They may not know about being a doctor, but they can build a smart work schedule that will make sure I get my product out the door on time and within budget.<p>The third role he had there, PM, should know how to administer the plan the VPE setup and keep all the ducks in a row. In a large organization, several PMs will report status of various projects to the VPE and make sure that the plan set forth by the VPE is operating.",1271815474

3525669,comment,3522965,3525312,4,0,socksy,,,"> One Exemple is this myth, that OSX' font rendering is always better thant the rendering of windows' rendering because OSX applies more anti-aliasing to the fonts. As soon as you get to a certain font size - usually the one you use for articles - anti-aliased fonts are a pain-in-the-eyes.<p>It's not quite that simple, and I'm not sure everyone would agree with that assertion. It's more to do with the fact that the font rendering is done differently (regarding whether the ""pixel grid"" is respected) rather than more anti-aliasing is applied.<p>> Microsoft payed above average for their fonts. Maybe more than the customers appreciate. But everytime I sit in front of an iPad, MacBook and the like, those dirty fonts destroy the whole product for me. The only way apple is gonna get rid of that cheap rendering performance is by investing in their rendering engine (not gonna happen) or by introducing retina displays in all of their products (more likely to happen).<p>Apple paid for their professional fonts too, even including Zapfino — simply to show off their font rendering. It's not cheaper, and they already invest a lot in to their rendering engine, which has improved in leaps and bounds over different versions of Mac OS X. Fonts that looks good on Mac OS X can come out terrible on Windows because manual hinting to every typeface has to be applied to make them look good, or Cleartype will come along and distort all the character forms.<p>The only reason you think Apple's font rendering is cheap is because you're not used to it — and it pervades everything you read. In contrast, to me Windows fonts look ""cheaper"", in that they're all thin and sickly. However, it should be understood that's it's a subjective choice, rather than one necessarily being better than another.<p><a href=""http://damieng.com/blog/2007/06/13/font-rendering-philosophies-of-windows-and-mac-os-x"" rel=""nofollow"">http://damieng.com/blog/2007/06/13/font-rendering-philosophi...</a> and <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/06/font-rendering-respecting-the-pixel-grid.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/06/font-rendering-resp...</a> might be interesting reading.",1327859671

3525666,comment,3522839,3522839,1,0,ypcx,,,"This is certainly a development to applaud, but for me, the most important feature about async JS programming is to be able to catch errors in the asynchronous code, and do it without code clutter. So I hope that if this gets accepted to mainline CoffeScript, it will provide for a working try/catch around the await/defer, along with caller+callee stacktraces capturing (at least in debug mode). At that point, it will be hard for me to <i>not</i> justify the use of one compilation layer above JavaScript, which currently certainly is, and even so with await/defer.<p>Asynchronous error handling without clutter is why I created LAEH, have a look if you want: <a href=""https://github.com/ypocat/laeh2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ypocat/laeh2</a><p>EDIT: To clarify - an uncaught error in async handler means your Node.js is going down (unless you use the catch-all handler, which is an even poorer practice).

It might be possible to more slowly build up a fanbase of regular readers, though.

What do your loved ones and colleagues think about your performance on a before-and-after basis if you have tried treatment?

3525604,comment,3525445,3525445,4,0,chaz,,,"The problem is that marketing is still what drives big numbers to watching a show. Lots of money is spent so that people know when the premiere and finale of each show is, every season. When shows are sold internationally, it's the local distributor who puts up the money to do all of the local marketing and slots in a local TV channel or other distribution. If a show was made everywhere internationally, the local distributor would miss out on the ability to monetize that viewer, since they went to the US site and watched it there. Some of the youngest, savviest audiences (ie the most valuable) would be lost.<p>This would go away if it was possible to synchronize broadcast episode schedules in all target markets, but that's almost impossible due to local differences. Also, it would mean that shows need to air the same time, and TV shows are really risky. Nobody is going to put up shows for international distribution until they've seen how it does in the US first.<p>This can also go away if a show goes exclusively pay-per-episode. This would only work for certain shows (can't see this for American Idol, but maybe for Breaking Bad), and only if streaming numbers were huge. Right now, they're pretty small. Hulu gets 6-7mm unique viewers per month across all of their content. It's safe to assume even a popular TV show is only going to get a few hundred thousand at the most. Breaking Bad's finale received 1.9mm TV viewers, so it's still TV that's driving scale. For more popular shows like Big Bang Theory, it's a few times that.<p>Very exciting times, but it will take a while. It was only in 2011 when we got services like Spotify broadly available for music, even though iTunes launched in 2001. Ten years to shift the consumer habits (ownership of bits; legacy of plastic CDs), industry thinking (signing the big 4; establishing royalty structures), and technical availability (3G/4G widely avail).

But they are not necessarily specifications that are easy to estimate, either.

It is at least theoretically possible to automate the finding of programs that satisfy specifications like your two examples above.

OTP behaviors and the other erlang stuff.<p>I think here, as with many things i would characgterize as large architectural language features, it's important to see the limitations of STm (I think Duffy talked about htis in the STM/C# postmortem), the tradeoff between number of variables in the transaction, size/complexity of read/writes (e.g. putting collections or btrees in transactions), and number of threads reading /writing the TVar every second.  GHC i would point out has some impressive STM benchmarks and I expect akka could do same but tweak a few things in your app and it will probably perform differently, very probably worse, depending on how much time you have on your hands.<p>I was thinkg in the context of the leaked Yammer/scala memo for an uncoming meetup, what if there were a dozen Rich Hickeys, or 2 dozen Simons for GHC, or whatever, their languages would still not be perfect, but the imperfections and myriad interactions of all these lang/runtime features would be clearly understood.<p>the issue of timestamping messages, guaranteeing send order, is one of the unresolved issues with BEAM and akka, and as far as I know, GHC and F#.  You can guarantee send order for one receiver and one sender only.  It seems to me that if you assume only local machines in physical proximity on a LAN, and assume away latency/partition, you could make some assumptions about message sending order from several sending processes (erlangese) to one receiver, or vice versa",1327857960

However, they probably will let the dust settle for a few weeks or few months before spending their cash. At least I hope so.<p>They aren't going to pull a Microsoft and purchase a search company. Google is not as much of a threat really. Search isn't Facebook's expertise <i>and</i> it isn't their market. They would be happy letting Google continue to drive people around for answers on the web, while Facebook will continue to entertain and be friendship/family/work/etc. communication/community focused.<p>So what <i>should</i> they do with it? Focus on communication, community/community needs, and gaming. They need to ensure that they keep the attention of their existing community.<p>As for what to do with the cash:<p>1. Hire some awesome user experience/interface people. And those people need to work on timeline/profile view. The only reason people aren't complaining more about it is that FB like Google does not really provide a customer support experience that makes you feel like they actually care about your opinion individually. If you've ever submitted a bug to FB, you know what I mean. As for the interface, alternating left and right updates on the timeline makes it tougher to read and find things. And the whole feed thing on the right needs to go away. There should be a single feed page and a single profile page with controls to change filtering on posts. That is so obvious and ubiquitous elsewhere, so failing to provide a good interface for status updates when that is basically the point is ridiculous.<p>2. Hire some better folks to lead up API development. It is a huge mess right now. Too many APIs that don't all do the same thing, and breaking Javascript API with changes. Not cool.<p>3. For M&A, focus on bringing resources onboard for community, ratings and reviews, e-commerce focus. They could easily compete with Amazon and/or eBay within the existing social/community framework and it is a better idea for business than simply referrals, advertising, and selling imaginary sheep for people's imaginary farms.",1327856826

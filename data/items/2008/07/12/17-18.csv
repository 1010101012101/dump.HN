Like hunting for a wife on dating sites or hunting for an employee in a resume database.  A lot (but not all) of the best options aren't going to put themselves out there as targets because the signal-to-noise ratio is so bad.<p>I'd second the ""find the watering hole where your prey is"" comment.",1215884596

And I think asserting the certainty of <i>particular</i> innate differences, without sufficient evidence, is more dubious than the corresponding assertion of equality.",1215884375

If everyone knows about open parking spaces, then everyone will rush to the nearest space causing more congestion around it. Once they get to the space and realize someone else got lucky, they will all go to the next nearest open space. So are you really solving the parking congestion problem?",1215883464

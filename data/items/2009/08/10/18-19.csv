We hadnâ€™t changed anything. It turned out a new version of a popular add-in released and the crash was happening in the add-in, but of course end-users only saw Word crashing.</i><p>Yeah, stupid users. They only saw Word crashing... but wait, Word <i>was</i> crashing. Sounds like there's a bug in the plugin system - just as applications shouldn't crash the OS, plugins shouldn't crash an application.<p>Hell, GMail warns me about slowdowns when I load it with Firebug is enabled - taking responsibility and acting on a <i>brower</i> add-on which is affecting <i>a web app's</i> user experience seems the wiser way of dealing with issues than blaming the user.<p>Summary of last part:<p>Please don't hate us, interwebs.

We had a Unisys mainframe -- and to the best of my knowledge, they're still running most of their stuff on it -- that was responsible for their accounting, their finance, their payroll, and <i>all</i> of their school operations.<p>If it only weighed in at a million lines of COBOL, I would be surprised.<p>And layered on top of that were, probably, tens of thousands of lines of WFL.<p>We spent months auditing (and patching) all of the functions in that systems.<p>When all was said and done, only a few unanticipated systems broke in the months following January 1, 2000.<p>However, had we not done all that work, I can assure you that nobody would have received a paycheck in January.<p>The people that always point to the end results of the Y2K bug as an example of unfounded hype bug me to no end. Have you even ever talked to someone that did Y2K work? I did, and it was not a picnic, and yes, a lot of things would have been broken if we hadn't done it. (Hell, there was even a critical patch for Sun DNS servers that had to be applied; I know this, because I applied it, and fought it with as it didn't work out quite right.)<p>As for 200 billion SLOC for COBOL ... yes, that seems a bit high, but I don't honestly think it's off by an order of magnitude. We were a little tiny system by lots of standards, and we were running easily a million lines of COBOL, and a huge chunk of it was custom code and in-house patches.",1249930449

753709,comment,753409,753409,0,0,ZachPruckowski,,,"This advice is the ""how to make the safest password possible"" advice.  In general, Schneier focuses not just on ""maximum security"", but also the security/utility trade-off.<p>Individual passwords for every site are probably overkill for many sites.  For sites where no money is involved, you may as well share a password.  If someone who knows my facebook password can access my slashdot account or my arstechnica account, that's not world-ending.  Similarly, if someone has my Bank of America password, I'm just as screwed as if they knew my Amazon password or my PayPal password, so if they were the same, it wouldn't matter much (they not in my case).<p>I think the easiest way to generate a secure and memorable password is through transformations.  For instance, if we reverse my name (Zachary), use symbols for the As and a 4 for the H, we get Yr@4c@z (no, this is not my password anywhere).  Similarly, if you go one letter at a time from parent's names, you get something like JEolhinzaanbatehatnh (which could similarly take a letter->number or letter->symbol transformation)<i>.  You get a secure password, and all you need to remember is the transformation algorithm.<p></i> - My parents' names are not Johnathan and Elizabeth, this is an example only.",1249930340

If you have any ability to capture that hash, you can dictionary the password to a set of candidates.<p>If the person hesitates typing just long enough to get an interim visualization, you can probably narrow it down to a hand-guessable subset of passwords.<p>This isn't a reasonable security concession for the value of eliminating a server roundtrip to confirm a password, especially given the fact that less than 2% of your user base will ever use the visualization, but 100% of your user base is exposed to the liability.",1249930299

Then many links appear underneath like 'smashing magazine' 'six apart' etc; places that have inspiration/asset posts that are generally pretty good.  Each of those links is a link to google with my keywords plus the ""site:"" tag added.<p>I toyed with google custom searches, but it wasn't as convenient.<p>My business 'neighborhood' has hacker news, serial entrepeneur, seth godin, personalmba and a bunch of others.<p>The benefit here is that I don't have to search the entire web (Google/DuckDuckGo).  I'm searching a 'pre-selected neighborhood of places that have already proved value to me'.<p>It'd be neat if I could share the ones I have made with other people, or if my friend who is a molecular biologist could make me a neighborhood for searching on bio stuff.  It'd be cool if I could browse some publicly shared ones, but mainly, get the ones my friends have; and even cooler yet, if we can have collaborative neighborhoods where any of us can add sites.<p>Of course the step after this would be to do the searches yourself (instead of linking to google), so there'd be less clicks but hehe, I don't know if you want to get into it <i>that</i> far...the duck duck go people thought it was worthwhile making new search engines, I don't know though....<p>I hear searches are the one area of online content where it's easy to make money on advertisement (since people are searching), even if you were just a meta that linked into google in specific ways, perhaps you can monetize that way.<p>I haven't thought out the business/monetization/complexity of making a search engine ..because my version works for me...saves me lots of time, and I like it.

753602,comment,753149,753149,0,0,ZachPruckowski,,,"When you're seeking to an idle disk, three things have an impact on speed:  Seek time, file fragmentation, and file size.  Given that your max throughput to any modern HDD is measured in megabytes per second, file size isn't the limiting factor.  You've got to get the drive spinning, get the drive head to the right spot, and read it.  If there's a pile of files, you've got to do that dozens of times if they're not stored near each other on disk.  Compressing the files doesn't really solve this problem.  What one might try, however, is arranging the disk storage such that the files are physically close to each other.  One could even go so far as to mash all the startup stuff into one super-file.<p>To see this in benchmark form, look at the difference in drive speed tests between large reads (sequential) and small reads (random).  You'll go from 60 Mb/s to 6 Mb/s when file size drops from gigabytes to kilobytes, because more of the time is spent seeking.",1249928029

There's a talk out there, I think by Gosling, about the direction of Java including why lambdas were rejected for Java 7. One reason was actually to prevent the sort of functional code that polarizes people in terms of whether it is seen as beautiful or opaque. (E.g. currying, Y combinators.)<p>Java provides the flexibility to use functional programming through anonymous inner classes, but at considerable pain to the author. The point people miss is that that pain is actually a conscious part of the language design.<p>Anyone can learn about map/filter/reduce, and every programmer needs to for the situations when they are crucial. But on the other hand, the problems with explicit looping are <i>much</i> overstated and I'll admit to emotionally siding on the issue with the creators of Java and Python.<p>I don't think you can ever fully get the ""how"" out of programming, nor should you try, nor is ""what"" <i>implicitly</i> superior all the time in all situations.",1249927499

Thanks to government funding, I was able to get a decent education (bachelor&#x27;s degree, I could go for a master&#x27;s but I couldn&#x27;t be arsed) and as a result a very good job (I&#x27;ve got the best job of anyone I know besides my colleagues). Upward mobility is very good here, unlike in the US where as far as I know you either need to have your parents save up half a house worth of college funding, or some magic college fund that only kids in movies get by playing in bands or being good at sports, or however that thing works. It&#x27;s an equal opportunities system.<p>Which unfortunately has been cut / downsized thanks to the economic crisis and probably capitalist goals, so the generation after me has less opportunities and can&#x27;t, for example, do a master&#x27;s after they do a bachelor&#x27;s without working alongside it or taking out a big loan.",1438469860

Their aim was lowering bandwidth costs by shifting the content delivery costs over to the end users. This was made clear by the fact that when you played a song, it started downloading the song from AWS S3 immediately to minimize latency, then once the P2P sessions fired up, shifted over to that stream instead of their costly S3 one.",1438469365

<a href=""http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/001115.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/001115.html</a><p>The situation has only been getting worse since then. For example, it&#x27;s been noted that the Win10 setup sequence is rigged to try fool users into switching to an MS browser, irrespective of their browser settings before they started the upgrade:<p>Mozilla isn’t happy with Microsoft for changing how users change the default web browser in Windows 10:
<a href=""http://microsoft-news.com/mozilla-isnt-happy-with-microsoft-for-changing-how-users-change-the-default-web-browser-in-windows-10/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://microsoft-news.com/mozilla-isnt-happy-with-microsoft-...</a><p>Pretty bad. But we have even lower to go, as we&#x27;ve seen that by default, Windows 10 actually steals bandwidth from your ISP connection so that Microsoft can use your computer, and your connection, to send MS updates to their other customers.<p>Huh? Say what?<p>Yep. It&#x27;s a devious little feature called Windows Update Delivery Optimization. It&#x27;s enabled by default. For Enterprise and Education users, it operates over the local LAN. For ordinary Home type users, Microsoft can send their data update goodies to potentially any PC on the global Internet -- from your PC, over your Internet connection. On your dime.<p>We could get into the pros and cons of local updates being staged between local machines on a LAN as opposed to the outside Internet.<p>But as soon as MS decided that it&#x27;s A-OK for them to use my Internet connection to cut down on their bandwidth costs serving their other customers -- without asking me for my specific permission first -- the situation blows into the red zone immediately.<p>Microsoft makes the predictable excuses about this high-tech thievery.<p>There&#x27;s a way you can turn it off. Yeah, buried down deep in the settings, assuming you even know about it in the first place. MS claims they only use your connection when it&#x27;s &quot;idle&quot; by their definitions. Thanks a bunch.<p>Oh yes, and (how generous of them!) Microsoft notes that they won&#x27;t steal bandwidth this way from &quot;metered&quot; connections.<p>But here&#x27;s the catch -- you have to manually indicate that a connection shouldn&#x27;t be used for MS&#x27; update delivery scheme. Otherwise, Microsoft has no way to know if (for example) you&#x27;re paying by the gigabyte or have a low bandwidth cap.<p>Above all, the sheer arrogance of Microsoft to enable this bandwidth theft by default is stunning.<p>I don&#x27;t care if they want to move 1K or 1gig to their other happy users, I want to damn well be asked permission first!<p>Obviously, this general category of peer-to-peer data transfer is used on the Net in other contexts, such as torrents for example -- but that&#x27;s something you do voluntarily, of your own volition. Comcast uses the bandwidth of many Comcast users to turn modems in people&#x27;s homes into public Wi-Fi access points. This has been highly controversial, but at least Comcast is typically doing it over modems they supplied, and has claimed that they over-provision the connection speeds to take this into account -- and don&#x27;t apply that public usage against home users&#x27; bandwidth caps.<p>But Microsoft didn&#x27;t even bother with such rationalizations. They simply said in essence: &quot;Hey, you&#x27;ve got bandwidth, so we&#x27;re gonna use it however we please unless you tell us differently. Suckers!&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re running Windows 10, you may want to terminate this travesty.<p>The settings you need are buried down in:<p>START->Settings->Update & Security->Windows Update->Advanced options, under: Choose how updates are delivered.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting at this point that if Google had tried a stupid stunt like this, there would likely already be EU commissioners running through the streets of Brussels hoisting pitchforks and flaming torches, all yelling for Google&#x27;s blood.<p>For a while there, it was starting to look like there indeed was a new kind of Microsoft coming into view, one that had evolved beyond the hubris that had so long been Microsoft&#x27;s single most defining characteristic.<p>As we can see, any such hopes are now ... Gone with the Win10.<p>--Lauren--

Unsigned, for handling countable elements, with 0 as minimum. The good point of using unsigned integers is that you have twice the available codes, because the extra bit.<p>Example for counting backwards using unsigned types (underflow check, -1 is 111...111 binary in 2&#x27;s complement representation, so -1 is equivalent to the biggest unsigned number):<p><pre><code>        size_t i = ss - 1, j = sso;

Example for compute percentage on unsigned integers (same idea can be applied for signed) without losing precision nor requiring bigger data container (overflow checks):<p><pre><code>        size_t s_size_t_pct(const size_t q, const size_t pct)
        {
                return q > 10000 ? (q / 100) * pct :
                                   (q * pct) / 100;
        }

</code></pre>
Also, for cases where overflow could happen, you can handle it doing something like this:<p><pre><code>        sbool_t s_size_t_overflow(const size_t off, const size_t inc)
        {
                return inc > (S_SIZET_MAX - off) ? S_TRUE : S_FALSE;
        }

        size_t s_size_t_add(size_t a, size_t b, size_t val_if_saturated)
        {
                return s_size_t_overflow(a, b) ? val_if_saturated : a + b;
        }

        size_t s_size_t_mul(size_t a, size_t b, size_t val_if_saturated)
        {
                RETURN_IF(b == 0, 0);
                return a > SIZE_MAX / b ? val_if_saturated : a * b;
        }

It&#x27;s a very interesting approach to writing interpreters/JIT compilers, and produces very fast code, but developing RPython code was very painful for a few reasons (back then, maybe they got fixed in the mean time):<p>1) Huge compilation times, and compilation is non-incremental. Making even a small change to the source code causes it to be fully re-compiled, which on our project took 15-20 minutes (I can only imagine how painful this is on PyPy, which took me around 2 hours to build the time I tried it). I think the root cause of this is the static analysis and type inference, which needs to run again on the entire source code, and proved to be really slow on a huge code base. This was painful for development, so much time wasted on waiting on the compiler.<p>2) My experience with error messages was not as positive as the OP&#x27;s. Sometimes, I&#x27;d make a type error in the code and get a cryptic error message, and have to guess by myself what caused it.

9988856,comment,9986627,9986627,0,0,Animats,,,"The article kind of misses the point. The reason for having a separate queue for connections in a SYN-RECEIVED state is to provide a defense against SYN flooding attacks.[1]  An incoming SYN has a source IP address, but that may be faked.  In a SYN flooding attack, large numbers of SYN packets with fake source addresses are sent. The connection will never reach ESTABLISHED, because the reply ACK goes to the fake source address, which didn&#x27;t send the SYN and won&#x27;t complete the handshake.<p>Early TCP implementations allocated all the resources for a connection, including the big buffers, when a SYN came in. SYN flooding attacks could tie up all of a server&#x27;s connection resources until the connection attempt timed out after a minute or two. So now, TCP implementations have to have a separate pool of connection data for connections in SYN-RECEIVED state.  There&#x27;s no data at that stage, so buffers are not yet needed, and a minimum amount of state has to be kept until the 3-way handshake completes.  Once the handshake completes, full connection resources are allocated and the connection goes to ESTABLISHED state.<p>This has nothing to do with behavior of established connections, or connection dropping.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood</a>",1438466616
9988855,comment,9988266,9988266,0,0,dietrichepp,,,"There are a lot of corner cases involved here.  The corner cases for signed integers involve undefined behavior, the corner cases for unsigned integers involve overflow.  Any time you mix them you get unsigned integers, which can give you big surprises.<p>For example, if z is unsigned, then both x and y will get converted to unsigned as well.  This can cause surprises when you expected the LHS to be negative, but it&#x27;s not, because the right side is unsigned, and that contaminates the left side.<p><pre><code>    if (x < y * z) { ... }
</code></pre>
This particular case gets caught by -Wall, but there are plenty of cases where unintended unsigned contagion doesn&#x27;t caught by the compiler.  Of course, if you make x long, then y * z will be unsigned, then widened to long, which gives you different results if you are on 32-bit or if you are on Windows.  Using signed integers everywhere reduces the cognitive load here, although if you are paranoid, you need to do overflow checking which is going to be a bear and you might want to switch to a language with bigints or checked arithmetic.<p>As another point, in the following statement, the compiler is allowed to assume that the loop terminates:<p><pre><code>    for (i = 0; i <= N; i++) { ... }
</code></pre>
Yes, even if N is INT_MAX.  The way I think of it, your use of &quot;signed&quot; means that you are communicating (better yet, <i>promising</i>) to the compiler that you believe overflow will not occur.  In these cases, the compiler will usually &quot;do the right thing&quot; when optimizing loops like this, where it sometimes can&#x27;t do that optimization for unsigned loop variables.<p>So I&#x27;m going to disagree as a point of style.  Signed arithmetic avoids unintended consequences for comparisons and arithmetic, and enables better loop optimizations by the compiler.  In my experience, this is usually correct, and it is rare that I actually want numbers to overflow and do something with them afterwards.<p>All said, if you don&#x27;t quite get the subtleties of arithmetic in C (yes, it is subtle) then your C code is fairly likely to have errors, and no style guide is going to be a panacea.",1438466606

This is completely different from the security mechanisms of Windows and Unix, which are based on protecting memory and separating the kernel and applications with a carefully checked interface.  I doubt that much existing OS code would be useful for the new OS.<p>Singularity is really exciting.  There are some big potential efficiency gains with this kind of OS.  The biggest one is in reducing the number of context switches performed by the computer.  A context switch is when the OS replaces the CPU's registers, saving the current values and reading in new ones.  This takes time and can push application data out of the cache.  With current OS's, every kernel call results in two expensive context switches.  One to enter kernel mode and another to return to the application. In Singularity, an application's call into the OS shouldn't require a context switch.",1217498038

I would not be at all surprised if your (extremely complex) body system had an 'equilibrium' weight which it will attempt to normalise itself at, at the translational, post-transcriptional or homonal level. likely a mix of both.",1217496463

I have worked in India before and there is just no comparison with the costs and I know there are plenty of qualified people over there...<p>What do you think?
Any advice?",1217496226

Yes, it sounds easy, and get rich quick, but the graveyard is full others not so fortunate.<p>Turning any business around effectively still requires skill and knowledge of the market and methods.<p>In a way, this article reminds me of other I read of people that buy poorly advertised items on eBay (poor description, no pictures) and turn them around for profit simply by putting up more detailed information and high quality images.<p>Essentially anyone can do it (low barrier to entry etc.), but the difference between those that do it well and make good money and those that can't/don’t really is often down to persistence, practice, more practice, and yet more practice, and in many cases fortunate timing. The fundamental lessons of flipping houses, flipping websites, or flipping any commodity seem to be the same.<p>I wonder how this can apply to flipping start-ups.",1217495718

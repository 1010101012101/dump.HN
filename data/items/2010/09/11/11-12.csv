You <i>could</i> write a crapload of messy wrapper functions that call external programs, or link in a library and avoid adding glue to your app.<p>The annoying answer is that it's ""cleaner"", the realistic answer is you don't have to account for as many potential problems you might encounter while executing applications on any given system. The sysadmin in me would use the tool but the programmer in me would use the API. (Oh, and depending on how heavily this application would get used, the API might be significantly faster and reduce load on the server...)",1284206323

1681396,comment,1680149,1681084,0,0,thesz,,,"I should note that stack manipulation gets easier when you assign types for values on stack. Combined with algebraic types from functional languages, it allows one to express very interesting programs in quite Forth way without breaking security of strongly typed languages.<p>For example, it is customary for Forth words to return value under flag: open-file ( String -- Sandle true | false ). Ie, if we then doing IF, we get ""handle"" on top of stack in THEN part and nothing on ELSE part. We cannot DUP or OVER those values using regular DUP or OVER. But open-file can be typed differently: open-file ( String -- Maybe Handle) and then we should scrutinize value in Maybe type (defined as data Maybe type = Nothing | Just type) using special onmaybe control word, much like if. DUP or OVER can require that their stack picture should contain only single word values and they won't operate with Maybe because Maybe isn't single-word.<p>I took an attempt to implement that in Haskell: <a href=""http://thesz.mskhug.ru/svn/misc/TypedStack.hs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thesz.mskhug.ru/svn/misc/TypedStack.hs</a>",1284205221

1681378,comment,1680149,1681155,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Hey Paul, thank you for those two super comments. I have some experience with stack languages as well, wrote my own little forth a long time ago and just posted a comment which (while much shorter than yours) tries to defend forths 'raison d'etre' as being limited to embedded systems, bootstrapping new hardware and pretty much nothing else.<p>The forth zealots are running out of steam very quickly when the programs and data structures get more complex, I've yet to see a program in forth longer than a few hundred lines (though I'm sure they exist).<p>If anybody ever wrote a bookkeeping system in Forth then I'm not aware of it. (and if they did it probably deals with whole dollar values only and is limited to a certain turnover).<p>Once long ago I worked on a project that contained the 'NOVIX', then brand spanking new and top of the line, a high level language directly executed on a chip.<p>The project started off really well, it contained a PC component and an embedded component, the other programmer was to write some image processing software for the NOVIX chip and it would output a high level representation of the image sensor data through the bus to the 386 which would do the presentation.<p>In the end I wrote the image processing code as well simply because the problem was too hard to solve in forth in a reasonable time, so we would simply pump raw image data across the bus (fortunately we had enough bandwidth for that).<p>The time to write the image processing component in C was exactly a single day.<p>Forth is at the other end of expressiveness compared to most languages, if the language matches your problem well it's amazingly compact and short, but if there is an impedance mismatch between the language and the problem at hand then you may very well end up in trouble you can not get out of. There are only so many DUPs and ROT3s you can see before your eyes glaze over, and even if local variables help they are not going to solve the underlying problem that Forth tends to force the programmer and the problem to adapt to Forth rather than the other way around.<p>Edit: Another thing I really like about Forth besides it being such a tiny core is the fact that any program in Forth is essentially a DSL.<p>If someone could remove the roadblocks that stop Forth/Factor projects from going above a certain size then that might ignite a more mainstream interest in to stack based languages.",1284204605

Happy to trip across this reply.<p>I will keep your suggestions in mind, though right now there is no money to hire a designer.  I did not start this site to make money and getting well has left me deeply in debt (though not getting well would likely have worse financial consequences and I at least have hope of cleaning up my financial mess now that I am healthy enough to work consistent overtime).<p>I think the stuff I do is very safe.  It is certainly safer than the path most people with my condition take.  But what I am running into is that a lot of them just don't have background info I have and therefore people sometimes make extremely dumb mistakes that can seriously damage their health.  So what seems ""obviously"" safe to me is not necessarily safe for someone who lacks general information about physiology, chemistry, or whatever and therefore doesn't know to avoid certain pitfalls.<p>I'm actually glad to hear the amount of info is overwhelming.  I always feel there is way too little info on the site.<p>As for the people who criticize:  To me, the main issue is that I have been thrown off some lists and the moderators usually side with the people who are attacking me.  So if I don't deal in some fashion with my critics, I may be unable to reach those folks who are interested. Yes, when I really don't feel well (or people have been especially ugly to me), I whine and cry about how people are mean to me.  But that isn't really my main concern.  However, some folks have found the website on their own without first meeting me on an email list.  And those folks typically are far more interested in and open to the information.

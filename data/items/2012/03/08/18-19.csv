And there were other people were saying that they wanted to see your github user-page as a resume (or they wanted the much more sane but still very flawed requirement: a github link on a resume).<p>Yesterday I was on an open source project's website looking for the repo link and just couldn't find it, pages that talked at length about how open source they were had no link, the download page had source tarballs but no link.  Then my mind clicked: they're using github and just assume that its the only place people anyone would ever look for source.  Ten seconds later I had found the source on github.<p>Right now it just seems like a curiosity (I probably wouldn't want to work for someone with such harebrained hiring process anyway) but I do worry that the trend might have some bad implications in the future.",1331232999

More women than men take it.  What does it cost a company when a woman goes on maternity leave?  In the U.S., are they required to pay her wages during her leave?  In many situations they will have no choice but to fill the position with a temporary worker since the woman is guaranteed the option to return.  How much does it cost a company to hire a short-term replacement?  The replacement may demand higher wages for short-term work and be less productive while learning the job.  Will the woman be as productive when she returns as when she left?  What additional costs crop up if the woman opts not to return?  Does the state or federal government offer any kind of ""baby credit"" to employers to offset these expenses?<p>Yes, I agree that discrimination is bad but, if there is a real financial reason behind it, it's not going to go away without making some changes.",1331232979

Substitute your own favourite activity for programming and you'll see what I mean. In addition, exercise carried all the unpleasant connotations of high school calisthenics, or the equivalent indignity of more modern, yet equally regimented, forms of workouts.<p>But is there a flaw in this argument after all? Indeed there is. The premises are correct, but the conclusion doesn't account for the fact that regular exercise will, in all likelihood, allow you to live longer. Let's look at the numbers.<p>So, if you're 40 years old, and you exercise 15 minutes a day from now until you turn 65, you'll have spent a total of about a quarter of a year exercising in those 25 years.<p>But, if by exercising you manage to live 3 years longer, you're ahead by a total of two and three quarters years by age 65--1000 days. Your increased life span works out to an additional 172 minutes per day from age 40 through 65. Even after spending 15 minutes exercising, the life extension you can expect from getting into shape gives you what amounts to two and half more hours per day to do whatever you enjoy most! Even if you live only one additional year through physical fitness, you'll still end up with 270 more days by exercising.<p>Of course, we're talking percentages here; you could be run over by a truck tomorrow.

I was able to create an account without giving my billing details (unlike Linode).  However, when I attempted to pay my invoice via their credit card form, authentication failed (maybe because it was an international payment and my bank freaked?).  So I tried again Paypal (yuck), and it worked.<p>2.  I received a some welcome emails, one of which had my intovps account <i>password in plain text</i>.  Big warning sign that they might not be hashing passwords in their DB.<p>3.  I opened a ticket about #2, and within minutes got this response:<p>""We don't store any of the passwords as plain text.\nSince we've received this complaints before I will talk to my colleagues to no longer send the password as plain text.""<p>So a little more encouraging.<p>I'll try to post updates as I try out their service.",1331230241

So it doesn't need to be in the footer of the map, when there is no footer at all (""at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors""), but I think the EULA/about not reasonable.<p>But other people might disagree. There are even people that think the whole license is invalid and that it can be used as Public Domain, because the license is for creative work and not meant to be used for databases.

That people would go ""OMG, Apple made their own maps, they are so awesome""? Apple gives credit to tons of stuff they use from Open Source projects, and contributes to many projects with people, from LLVM and Clang to MacRuby, to Webkit, to standard user-land stuff.<p>Here's what happened, from my 10+ year experience with following Apple. Apple used the data and didn't provide any attribution yet, but will do so in the near future, and will collaborate and improve OSM data. The reason they didn't say anything yet, is the standard veil of secrecy they use. They couldn't go ahead and talk with OSM stuff about it, probably they weren't even let to add an attribution to the iOS beta versions, so they just shipped it as it is.",1331229886

And for me it actually becomes more frequent as I progress further in my career as a dev. This is because it becomes more apparent to me how much I <i>don't</i> know, and I begin to wonder if I'll ever be good enough to attain the level of expertise that I aspire to.<p>What makes it more poignant for me is that I've pursued something like this before (sports career) and didn't quite make it (understatement), and I'm currently trying to reconcile myself with all the time and effort I invested in the process and how to ramp down from something that was my overriding ambition for so long. The good thing is that I've learned a lot of lessons from the experience and the main takeaway for me was ... if it isn't working, get out ... life is too short and there are many many other things to try your hand at.<p>The second thing that I liked about it was how it shows exactly why we should have empathy for other developers. I loved this section<p><i>For every dude I dismiss, every footnote in a roundup post, every guy deemed worthy of mere shrugs or raised eyebrows — all of whom are well-compensated for their work, no doubt — there is someone far away on the other end of the phone coaching him or advising him or loving him who wants desperately for him to succeed and be happy</i><p>because one of the things I try to live by is this<p><i>Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle --- Plato</i><p>I've had endured a few insults in my life as a dev (""You'll never be an engineer son, maybe a scripter or something, but never an engineer""), by people who thought I'd never make it as a programmer. Many years, later, here I am ... doing a pretty decent job at it, and I'll never forget all the kind people who encouraged me, took a time out to explain something to me ... again, just like I'll never forget the couple of times someone was a complete dick to me, because they thought I had no prospects as a developer.<p>I guess what I'm saying is, whenever you feel the need to dismiss someone who has no skills ... maybe take a step back and see if what they need is encouragement, coaching and a little bit of direction instead.",1331229662

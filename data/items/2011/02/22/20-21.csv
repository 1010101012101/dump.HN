Some devs hit that cap after 4 years, some after ten.  But a smaller and smaller percentage of employees are promoted to a higher level after the requisite amount of experience.<p>At Google and Microsoft there is very large percentage (~60%)of employees in the T4/SDEII bracket.  This is the 2-5 year experience bracket.  The percentage of employees in a level   exponentially tapers off when compared against higher levels.  This could be one explanation of the graph as presented.<p>At the companies you mention, the graph is accurate when plotted against population but incorrect when plotted against level.<p>Mid to higher levels see approx linear growth in salary and compensation until the top echelon.  The compensation difference between two levels is approximately 10% the starting salary of a college hire.  However, this highest levels including directors, tech managers and partners see clearly non-continuous bump in salary and equity (2-5x salary, 10-50x stock).",1298408038

That said, it's too heavy. 1.5lbs is really light when you have a laptop that you set down to use, but when you actually hold the device whenever you're using it, that weight adds up. It needs a better display. Please don't misunderstand me, the iPad has an amazing display compared to what was available when it launched. When you hold an iPhone 3GS up to an iPad the phone looks like it's using 16 bit EGA. But the galaxy tab and the iPhone 4 have raised the bar for what consumers expect. Finally, it needs at least a front facing and would benefit from two cameras. The new iPad also needs FaceTime. Also, if apple were smart they'd add the same camera the iPhone 4 uses to the rear. That would further lock up production capacity so that competitors can't use the backlit camera technology in their stuff.

In my research, I've found attempts at both methods you describe above, in various forms and various states, with widely varying degrees of success, but most have ended in failure. The ""successes"" tend to offer some limited choice in plans, but the rates certainly aren't great and the deductibles are still pretty high -- mostly it's a fallback safety net for serious emergencies.<p>I think a startup that can help tackle this issue would create tremendous value in the payor / consumer market, but the field is extraordinarly complicated and requires a very rare multi-disciplinary background in individual state law (CA's system alone is very different from, say, MA's bc CA is HMO-based and MA has a public option), behavioral economics, gov't regulation, insurance underwriting methods, insurance administrative practices. Oh, and if it's a tech startup, the team would obviously need web dev / product skills as well.<p>The problem is, developing a basic mastery of all these subjects takes a lot of time -- reading, thinking, and experiencing to understand the pain points deeply. That tends to cut against the stereotypical startup team of two young twenty-somethings hacking away and living on ramen, who have never studied the insurance industry or directly experienced the pain of searching for or relying heavily on health insurance (bc young 20 somethings tend not to have major health problems). I think that's a key reason why startups haven't done much innovation in the insurance payer market.<p>My latest line of thinking is about whether there are hacks around the problem that can incrementally chip away at and disintermediate insurance payers as the sole gateway to affordable healthcare.",1298406349

3047845,comment,3047113,3047113,3,0,rubenbos,,,"Really interesting article.<p>I can imagine there are a lot of companies that don't sell Scrum right. For example: teams are still ordered to fulfill a fixed scope in a fixed amount of time. As a team you can't fight that. It's not the fault of the team.<p>But from your article I understand 'Low Quality Code' and 'technical debt' are always the fault of Organizers. I don't agree on that.<p>A team estimates (led by their scrum master) how long they will be working on a user story. It's their responsibility to take everything account that's needed. They know how much time has to be spent to get the code right.<p>The Product Owner just gets the estimates from the sprint planning and knows how far the team can get. The team said they could do a particular user story in 5 points right? If that's 5 points with crap code as a result... well, maybe it was a too optimistic estimate with no space for good code.",1317218341

And I had thought it was the norm until I met other Japanese professional programmers. Somehow they thought they were allowed to stay whining about not being able to get information from English resources.<p>Once I told the management to have them learn English because it's almost mandatory for a software engineer to understand English as much as an aspiring Go player would learn Japanese. But the management told me back it's _harsh_ to require them to learn anything more. Harsh? Huh?<p>That said, I found the need for technical books real, and translated several English books (including Programming Erlang) into Japanese. However I know this effort will not scale and these days I am inclined to abandon translation and tell them that English is just another tool you have to learn to survive.",1317218287

3047827,comment,3047642,3047642,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Yes, but what the heck to do with it?<p>Here is one answer.  It is central in a technique to find the numerically exact inverse of a matrix using essentially only single precision, integer arithmetic.<p>How?  Take the system of equations and multiply by some factors of 10 to make all the given numbers integers.  For each number in a sufficiently long list of single precision prime numbers, solve the equation in the integers modulo that prime.  Just use Gaussian elimination.  Where in Gaussian elimination have to divide to get a 1, just use the multiplicative inverse in the integers modulo the prime found from the GCD algorithm.  So, get the solution in the integers modulo that prime.  When repeat for each prime in the list, then can easily use the Chinese remainder theorem to construct the rational numbers, ratios of multiple precison integers, of the exact solution.  Of course now with processors with many cores, the work for the several  primes can proceed in parallel.  ""Look, Ma, no more worries about matrix condition number!"".",1317218114

3047745,comment,3046038,3046038,2,0,kazuya,,,"FWIW here's a story about the scene, by a native Japanese.<p>It was more than 10 years ago when I joined Fujitsu's 3G cellular network project as a subcontractor. It was a huge complex project and I believe was one of the first 3G networks deployed in the world. So I expected I would work with teams of descent engineers.<p>Except most of them were not.<p>The subproject had dozens of 'engineers', but many of them had just finished vocational schools that didn't teach them even programming in C. To make it worse, the existing code base was the exemplar of bad code, e.g. each function had more than 3000 lines, function names were a letter and some digits and we had to consult some other documents to find out what they were expected to do, etc as well as more architectural design problems. In fact there I was able to find every horror story about software development.<p>Why did such a mess happen? One of the reasons was that the contractor company (who then outsourced some senior positions to subcontractors like me) were paid by the headcount of engineers it offered to the project. No kidding. So, in order to maximize the profit, the contractor made up a legion of those incapables who were paid less. Expectedly that made things worse, and Fujitsu thought it needed more engineers to solve the problems. Vicious circle.<p>I had tried to make the situation better, but the root cause was not in the technical side and I had no clue. The only nice thing for me was that during the personal research to improve the project I got to know Erlang, which was of course never ever used in the project because of the similar reasons mentioned in the article.",1317216835

At times, it felt like he wasn't sure what he wanted to say next.<p>2. There were too many people. Maybe I shouldn't complain, since I am not sure if I would be invited if YC didn't invite so many, but it meant that the speakers/alumni were crowded-out most of the time. Having booths would make it easier to find alumni, but it makes it more like a career fair so I am not sure I like that too much either. Another alternative would be to split up the area into multiple sub-areas for each of the speakers, and have a separate parallel Q&A. I have seen this done successfully in other industry conferences.<p>3. I thought the presentations were generally quite good and left me inspired (and scared as well). Talking about YC's application process would have been a waste of time since most people seemed quite familiar with YC anyway. The one thing I would have changed - having some time for on-the-spot Q&A.<p>4. The lack of explanation about color coding was a major complaint. I would have had 2 icons per badge instead of color coding - one indicating if you were a designer/developer etc., and the other icon indicating whether you were looking for a job, trying to hire etc. Good, obvious icons are way easier to understand than color codes.<p>Overall, I am happy that YC came to NYC, and that I got the opportunity to meet so many cool people. So thank you YC team for that, and for bringing me a couple of steps closer to making the leap :)",1317215764

This grant-sucking infrastructure isn't free, and apart from the direct costs of grantwriting / paperwork / etc., universities sometimes even undertake major expenditures with a view towards making themselves more attractive to grants, e.g. tailoring construction or hiring towards grant opportunities, flying people around and hosting events to oil the gears of potential partnerships, etc., etc.<p>The top research universities pull in enough grants to make that all worth it, but many smaller universities don't ever come out ahead, though they like to pretend they do. There are small schools where they consider it a huge success that they land a $1m NSF grant now and then, but they are almost certainly spending more than $1m every few years to do so. In addition, even when you <i>do</i> land grants, co-financing is becoming more popular, so the university ends up having to kick in even more money in the successful case.<p>A bit more on that from Georgia Tech's former CS dean: <a href=""http://innovate-wwc.com/2011/05/18/if-you-have-to-ask-ten-sure-fire-ways-to-lose-money-on-research/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://innovate-wwc.com/2011/05/18/if-you-have-to-ask-ten-su...</a>",1317215624

3047641,comment,3047046,3047396,7,0,jacques_chester,,,"> I want a program that will take a set of unit tests, and create a program that takes a piece of code and evolves it until all those tests pass.<p>Look into Genetic Programming (as opposed to Genetic Algorithms, Evolutionary Programming or Evolutionary strategies, three other fields that arose independently).<p>In GP, the genotype being evolved is a program, usually represented as either a tree of instructions or a string of assembler instructions. There are other schemes but these are the major two.<p>However, there's a fly in the ointment. Averaged over every possible computable problem, no one algorithm is the ""best"".  It's called the ""no free lunch theorem"". The upshot is that with some clever encoding of domain knowledge into the genotypical space, you can often produce systems that outperform human-designed systems. But you cannot start from an absolutely generic genotype and necessarily arrive at the 'best' algorithm, you will always need some degree of manual intervention. Don't ask me to explain it better, I can't because I don't follow the maths.<p>GP has lots of interesting nooks and crannies, I refer you to <i>A Field Guide to Genetic Programming</i> for a fairly readable introduction: <a href=""http://www.gp-field-guide.org.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gp-field-guide.org.uk/</a>",1317215311

I take the iPad almost everywhere, so I have no need for an iPhone which is little more than an iPad Nano. Thing is, I need that ""little more"" - the phone part - as well, and want it as a separate device which I _can_ have everywhere. It's back to the ""just a phone"" desire, a device focused on making phone calls with Apple design sensibilities. Take an iPod Nano, insert a bigger battery & cellular chip, support Bluetooth headsets, sell millions.<p>Methinks coincidence though.

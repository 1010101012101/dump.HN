2) All employees add organizational inertia; in the case of low value employees, this is needless and prevents adaptation to changing market conditions, which can doom any organization.

Imagine you had to download a hacker news exe, and a google exe, and a reddit exe, etc.<p>By making customers download individual apps, your product becomes harder to implement/less profitable for stores which do not have an app with broad customer adoption. That makes you miss out on the long tail, which in this case could be considerable.<p>The locationally dependent browsing over in store wifi doesn&#x27;t have this downside. It could leverage exsisting web technology, which makes the development off these apps a lot easier. It  might work like this:<p>1. You walk into the beacon range. The beacon sends you the url: int.somestore.com/locationx?val=123094&locationy?val=594952&locationz=40389 
2. It sends you the connection data for the internal wifi which serves up the stores webapplication.
3. The webapp is shown in the estimote app. 
4. Profit.",1375990952

It seems like it&#x27;s mostly of theoretical relevance for parties of differing computational abilities, which is why I had a hard time grokking it. But it&#x27;d definitely come into play say if one ran two instances with the same RSA group.<p>> <i>in online digital cash protocols (like Chaum&#x27;s), there is no need for an authority on identities, or even for identities</i><p>Actually there is, but that requirement is <i>concentrated</i> in the bank, which all users have to trust to steward the currency&#x27;s value. While it&#x27;s theoretically possible to bootstrap a trustable identity, there&#x27;s little incentive to trust one party against whom you have no recourse, so adoption requires a real-world identity. These systems would be in widespread use if any government preserved individual rights. Alas.<p>> <i>The problem with Bitcoin is that validity is not well-defined and can change without warning</i><p>So can Chaum&#x27;s system. Three words: bank shuts down. The protocol instance is fine, but all real-world balances become invalid. In general, it feels like you&#x27;re reacting to a lack of guarantees that are usually provided by the <i>assumptions</i> of existing systems, and that your definitions preclude the novel and necessary parts of Bitcoin.<p>If there were only one exchange, we would say validity is whatever it accepts (which would hopefully be well-defined and non-repudiable. yes, Bitcoin would make an absolutely terrible single-issuer protocol). But once you talk about multiple exchanges, the definition must become fluid. If exchange A calls coins stolen and refuses to exchange them, exchange B will still exchange them because it hasn&#x27;t become aware of this yet, and less-reputable exchange C will exchange them at a 50% discount, are they &quot;valid&quot; ?<p>The reliance on hashing is another fallout from deconcentrating authority. I can think of a few other ways to remove trusted authorities, but they&#x27;d be equally disconcerting.

They should be a great company according to Drucker but the effect of their success is that nobody wants to be associated with them and so their &#x27;value&#x27; goes down.<p>Rather than create a problem in solve it, I read Jensen as articulating how external interest to the company with a single metric (share price) can moderate the behaviours of an otherwise free market entity in a way which reflects the values of the wider group of people. Thus allowing a &#x27;publicly&#x27; held company to achieve its goal in a morally superior way to a company that was not required to seek approval from the general public. This very closely mimics the behaviour changes in democratic societies (elected by the public) and theocratic or monarch type societies where the set of people that need to be &#x27;ok&#x27; with the action of the leaders is much more constrained.<p>So what did you get out of Jensen?",1375990278

6181177,comment,6178422,6178422,3,0,mrxd,,,"Reading this made me wonder if the author really has a good understanding of what&#x27;s going on in the UX field. Maybe he&#x27;s run into a few people calling themselves UX designers and then generalizing from a small sample into the entire field? I don&#x27;t know. Here&#x27;s some things that I wish everyone understood:<p>1. UX designers aren&#x27;t solely in charge of the user experience - Yes, UX designers have been saying that from day one. UX is about breaking down organizational barriers and facilitating collaboration across disciplines. That&#x27;s fundamental to the concept, because looking at a product from a user&#x27;s perspective, you don&#x27;t see organizational divisions, internal politics, fiefdoms dominated by specific disciplines and so on. Users experience a product in a holistic way, but organizations are fragmented into specializations. Poor UX is often the result of organizations optimizing for the efficiency of division of labor without understanding the tradeoff for the end user. That&#x27;s a fundamental mismatch that UX tries to remedy.<p>2. UX designers didn&#x27;t take ownership away from anyone. When the discipline was first emerging, very few people cared. Over the last 15 years, the trend has been UX designers saying things like &quot;How do I get my developers to care about the user&#x27;s experience?&quot; Now UX is starting to become strategically important, and (some, not all) developers realize that they&#x27;re getting left behind. That&#x27;s not UX designers doing it to you, that&#x27;s a self-inflicted wound. I started as a developer 10 years ago, but quickly realized that UX was the future, and made the switch. UX designers have been banging the drum for 15 years trying to get everyone working together. A lot of developers are only now starting to wake up and realize they need to be involved, but find themselves at a 10-15 year disadvantage. Others stepped up and took ownership over something that no one else cared about and today they have experience, knowledge, skills and a track record in a strategically important area. Sorry about that. We tried to tell you.<p>3. Elliot comes off pretty naive when he talks about iteration. That&#x27;s a pretty new idea in software, which has historically been dominated by a requirements-oriented traditional engineering mindset. As a result, some developers talk about iteration like they invented it, but other product design disciplines - architecture, graphic design, film, fashion, industrial design - have been doing iteration for many decades, probably even centuries. You know how designers talk about mockups? Here&#x27;s the wikipedia definition of a mockup: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockup</a><p>> &quot;In manufacturing and design, a mockup, or mock-up, is a scale or full-size model of a design or device, used for teaching, demonstration, design evaluation, promotion, and other purposes. A mockup is a prototype if it provides at least part of the functionality of a system and enables testing of a design. Mock-ups are used by designers mainly to acquire feedback from users.&quot;<p>4. There are still many large barriers to developers participating in the UX process, but the important ones aren&#x27;t about job titles. Here are some things developers need to deal with when getting involved in UX:<p>- Lack of career incentives - when you interview for your next job, are you going to be asked any questions about the UX of what you worked on? Is your performance at your current job evaluated in terms of your impact on UX? Do you hold yourself personally accountable for poor UX? If not, then like the chicken and pig fable, you&#x27;re involved but not committed. It&#x27;s one thing to say that everyone is responsible for a good UX. It&#x27;s another to actually hold people (or yourself) responsible.<p>- Lack of empathy - you&#x27;re building a product for someone else to use. If you privilege your own preferences and way of working, if you lack the flexibility to adopt the mindset of someone who is very different from you, you won&#x27;t succeed in UX. You&#x27;re probably very smart. Don&#x27;t let that get in the way of empathizing with people who you think are beneath you.<p>- Lack of skills - you don&#x27;t need visual design skills to contribute to UX. At a strategic level, UX is about understanding people: what they need and want, what motivates them, what&#x27;s important to them. The best UX designers are insightful observers of human nature.<p>- Over-specialization - for some people, their whole lives revolve around their job. Good UX designers are relentlessly curious about a wide range of topics and activities. They don&#x27;t accept artificial divisions of labor at work, and definitely don&#x27;t let them carry over into their personal lives. Remember the saying: nothing human is alien to me.",1375989930

You know, choose a datastore and start modeling/scaffolding right away, it&#x27;s the rails way. That&#x27;s why I inverted this in my post. I agree with you - the client is the most important thing to think about. When all is said and done <i>only the client experience matters</i> for your customers.<p>2. Of course, there are many solutions out there. I especially like Backbone for it&#x27;s minimalistic nature, forcing you to nothing else than using something jQuery-ish thing. Since it&#x27;s written by the same guys that wrote coffeescript (i prefer over JS), i like the combination of both. subtile thingie.<p>3. Yeah, of course it&#x27;s not a real framework. But for some usecases, like providing special APIs, pure node.js without express might be enough. If not, you may pick express or anything on top of it. (most frameworks seem to be built on top of express nowadays)<p>4. Well both know that rails won&#x27;t die the next years or even centuries. Personally i am currently employed as a Rails developer and see the mindshift... slowly but steady. Many developers are playing with it, don&#x27;t find it amazing first time (&quot;nothing new to see here, i can do this too with language XYZ&quot;), but after some time passed, they realize what&#x27;s different and they&#x27;re impressed more and more. Especially startups that built their first release with a classic rails/mysql-stack and need to (often struggling to) scale seem to be interested to switch over.<p>Finally, the most important point is: master JavaScript. This includes (!) stuff like Coffeescript if you like it. And then look at the vast and emerging ecosystem around it. If you don&#x27;t need rocketscience-numbercrunching and/or don&#x27;t have the tight constraints of embedded systems, nearly everything is possible. Take any other &quot;server&quot;-language, and you&#x27;ll have to deal with tons of Javascript anyways.

Watching users interact with your product directly provides a whole different level of insight.<p>A few things that I can think of that they may already be considering:<p>1. Asking the developer to specify explicitly which screens should be recorded. From the article, it seems like it&#x27;s opt-out (the developer specifies which screens should <i>not</i> be recorded), rather than opt-in.<p>2. Showing long recordings at high speed, slowing down/pausing at &quot;interesting&quot; portions<p>3. Data aggregated across multiple users: for example, a report of places in the app where most users pause the longest<p>4. Displays of multiple users&#x27; interactions with a single screen, overlaid on top of each other<p>5.

Even at 56C, it&#x27;s not far outside the temperature range of a typical cup of coffee [1]. According to that link from coffeedetective.com, coffee should be served closer to 80C. They even list the low end of proper coffee temperature at 65C (and other sources I found on Google corroborate). As nicotine and caffine serve similar functions, I&#x27;m not sure that the temperature at the throat is necessarily an issue. How many people pour a fresh cup of coffee and breathe in the steam coming off the top?

If you are already dealing with briefcases of cash, it is a simple matter to buy BitCoin using one of those briefcases anonymously. Throw Tor in the mix, and you&#x27;d have to be the next Bin Laden for the world to dedicate the resources necessary to uncover your dealings.

It is very difficult to store, being susceptible to mites and fungus. It is very difficult to exchange large quantities, think pallets instead of briefcases for millions/billions of dollars (which is the primary reason they don&#x27;t make a $1000 bill). It is nearly impossible to exchange any meaningful amount cross-border. It is difficult to count and keep track of. It is easier to counterfeit and get bad cash. Cash has serial numbers, fingerprints, and DNA all over them (I&#x27;m surprised we don&#x27;t hear more about cash forensics, or bugged cash with tracking chips in them).<p>Cash will still be used for the last mile, for the street-level &quot;retail&quot; transactions. But when those get gathered up and need to be sent back to headquarters, or between organizations, or to other nations, the backhaul, by necessity, needs to run on something more sophisticated. Today, that seems to be Bitcoin, even though I agree with you that it is far from perfect. Its first-mover advantage is allowing it to build a robust ecosystem of services that is making it that much harder for an incumbent to take its place. But when that super currency does come, and crime shifts to using it, I predict a relatively straight decline in BitCoin value.",1375988434

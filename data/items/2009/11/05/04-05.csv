923343,comment,922919,922919,0,0,GavinB,,,"Scalzi is missing quite a few points here.<p>1) 1KTF is not about today. It's a future possibility. In a few years there will be a large ebook market with very low distribution cost. For True Fans, you'll be able to sell to them directly, with no middleman.<p>2) 1KTF is about independent artists. His calculations still involve publishers. The publication route will still exist and have large marketing budgets and small royalties--which is great for the right sort of creator. 1KTF is an alternate route.<p>3) 1KTF requires direct upkeep of your fans. Scalzi talks about exceptional circumstances where he had a connection to the artist--that's the whole point. The 1KTF artist will have to cater directly to the fans. When the artist becomes friends with her fans, suddenly the wallet opens up. This isn't faux ""I appreciate you here's an autograph"" friendship. It means you respond personally to every single e-mail, tweet, etc. You do work specifically for them. He mentions a drawing of his wife as exceptional circumstances. It's not. To get 1KTF, you may have to draw a lot of folks' wives.<p>As a side note, there are plenty of people out there willing to dole out at 1KTF levels. Every WOW player, for instance, is paying more than $100 a year. There are lots of concert and sports tickets that cost $100 for a single event.<p>There's one thing that Scalzi is right about. Getting to a 1KTF level is extremely hard. It may be one of the least efficient ways to get an income. But it might also make for a fulfilling life.",1257397158

Most devices that include GPS capability do not bother to reinvent the wheel, but instead elect to integrate an existing GPS processing chip.<p>GPS chips usually output various location sentences over standard RS232 (or I2C) a rate of around 1 Hz. It is unlikely that AT&T went through the trouble to design their own GPS processor into the Femtocell ASIC--it's likely connected but separate.<p>So, if the GPS data line could be isolated, it would be well within the capability of a microcontroller to feed fake GPS NMEA sentences [1] to the Femtocell ASIC using that line. Maintaining an updated time field in the NMEA sentences might require a separate real-time clock chip, but the Femtocell may not even examine the time given by the GPS.<p>A PIC microcontroller could cost less than $5, not including the cost of a compiler and hardware programmer.<p>Program a microcontroller to output an artificial location, cut a trace, solder a few leads, and you could make a Femtocell think it is Topeka, even if it is connected to the Internet in Turin.<p>[1] <a href=""http://aprs.gids.nl/nmea/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aprs.gids.nl/nmea/</a>",1257396175

I think Scalzi is (perhaps wilfully) missing the point. He seems to be pointing at his (as an example. He is right that this applies to most) fan spectrum and noticing that there are very few 'true fans' in there & that most of the revenue comes from normal fans. He then goes on to demonstrate that very rarely do people spend $100+ on a single artist. The people who do are rare gems.<p>Nowhere does it say that your true fans are already spending $100 each with you. Most artists do not really cater to these. This is the point. Most artists cater to many more $20 fans instead.<p>Here is an example. I really like Leonard Cohen. Over the years, I have probably bought about 10 cds & books, saw a documentary of his a few years ago with my girlfreand. I went to a concert this year (2 tickets @ over $100). It doesn't add up to close to 'true fandom' though. I never bought a T shirt or an expensive premium copy of any books or CDS. Why?  I don't really like that kind of stuff. Most people don't. I am willing to spend more than $100 every year, but I have no use for special edition CDs or Leonard Cohen underpants. To get me in to the $100-$200 range, I would need to be offered more stuff I want, not just the ability to be some really expensve, die-hard only souvenir. I'd gladly see a two or three shows and a poetry reading a year, provided the cost was not so high. If he got creative & ran a writing class, I might attend. Say 1 cd + 3 shows + one-off film/seminar/debate/whatever = $20 + 3* $30-$100 + something = $100-$200.<p>The point to note is that Leonard Cohen does not cater to me as a true fan. He caters to me (and millions of others)as a normal fan.<p>Catering to fans willing to spend a lot with you is not exactly the same as catering to fans willing to spend a little. The point is that creative people have lots of choices, they can do various revenue making things. Adopting the true fans approach means choosing mostly those things that people who like you a lot will appreciate.",1257394778

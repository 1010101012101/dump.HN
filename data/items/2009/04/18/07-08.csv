But from a purely business perspective: In my experience, small-scale users are some of the most important ones to have, since they tend to be the ones who go around telling everybody they know about tarsnap.",1240041515

568180,comment,567807,567807,0,0,adrianwaj,,,"I'll sum it up: for a nice guy, the onus is on the female to say ""yes"" to his advances (if any) and for the dark-triad male, the onus is on her to say ""no"" to his advances.<p>As sexuality today is still very much mostly a powerful unconscious drive, it is harder for most females to say ""yes"" than ""no,"" because saying yes is a conscious decision and the female instead finds it easier to remain passive to her powerful unconscious side around these aholes, and which is why she's even interested in either in the first place.<p>Aholes can muscle in on the nice guy, and we have not reached the tipping point for many females to take better control of their sexuality.<p>In the end you can be a nice guy, but when the ahole comes along, be prepared. Don't leave it up to her to say yes.",1240040778

568168,comment,567807,567807,0,0,strlen,,,"As I mentioned in a different comment, I think the issue boils down to having unrealistic expectations -- and these unrealistic expectations preventing smart individuals from getting any sort of experience in dating (which builds confidence) or finding out what they really want (e.g. Are you unable to date someone who doesn't share your political views? Who isn't a fellow nerd? who doesn't have a specific body type? You'll never whether any of these ""must haves"" is really something you're looking for until you try).<p>In addition, getting into physical shape wouldn't hurt: initial attraction (what gets you the first date) is still mostly physical and being in good shape makes one confident (which gets you past the first three dates). Being in shape will also give you far more energy for 80 work weeks and all night hackathons (in no way, will being physically fit magically make you into a ""jock"").",1240039404

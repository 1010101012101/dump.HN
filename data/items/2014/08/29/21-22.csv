8244695,comment,8229513,8243238,2,0,pdkl95,,,"I suspect you may not have played many of the recent adventure maps, or played Minecraft for extended periods of time. It has been <i>incredibly</i> successful - despite the blocks, which you just accept after a while - at inducing a suspension of disbelief.<p>I agree, VR is about the perception of being &quot;in&quot; a space, and the <i>interactivity</i> and <i>mutability</i> of the space provided by Minecraft is better[1] than basically everything that came before it. This interactivity engages (and distracts) the player&#x27;s attention, and because our focus is limited[2], stuff like &quot;graphics quality&quot; can become less important. Better tech can help, of course, but no matter how good the graphics and sound are, finding that you can&#x27;t open a door because it was only part of the &quot;painted on&quot; scenery can rip you out of the illusion. This problem of having an environment that &quot;reacts properly&quot; is exactly what Minecraft tries to solve.[3]<p>Also, I fully agree sound is <i>very</i> important, and watching people freak out HARD (in ways similar to the way some people freak out when using the Oculus) simply hearing a subtle sound effect. The &quot;creeper&quot; in Minecraft is well known for this effect.<p>[1] &quot;better&quot; is subjective, of course, and Oculus is <i>very</i> good at what it does. It&#x27;s too bad about the facebook acuisition, because Notch obvious recognized the power that Minecraft <i>with</i> Oculus would probably have.<p>[2] Simple demo of what I mean ( <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKCT-simmBo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKCT-simmBo</a> ), and a better explanation by Apollo Robins regarding how it is exploitable ( <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0k2gja3ym4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0k2gja3ym4</a> ).<p>[3] The &quot;blocks&quot; are part of the way Minecraft tries to solve interactivity. Violating your expectations breaks even the best illusion, and it&#x27;s easier to believe you&#x27;re in a strange cube world because it simplifies the the problem of making the environment self-consistent.",1409349313

Experimenting with new approaches and ideas, direct competition between projects, excitement over new languages and frameworks. These are all factors that lead to advancing the state of the art.<p>It&#x27;s worth being concerned about losing the lessons learned from Qt, but this is a kind of false dichotomy between the old and the new.<p>With that said, I don&#x27;t think those lessons will be lost anyway. Qt can&#x27;t (and shouldn&#x27;t!) last forever or remain in its current form. C++, though it will live for a long time yet, will eventually fall out of favor, and large sections will eventually be purged from Qt as the project matures. The man-years that went into the portions that were, or some day will be, removed have taught Qt developers and users a great deal.<p>Qt developers and users will bring knowledge and wisdom to new projects that will compete with Qt (directly or indirectly). Some projects will survive and some won&#x27;t. Some will be much the same as Qt, while some will be completely different from the start. Conrod, as it happens, is an approach to a different kind of GUI development (see this comment: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8244224"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8244224</a>).<p>This, of course, doesn&#x27;t include developers who do their own things without ever using Qt.

8244547,comment,8243523,8243523,131,0,clarle,,,"First posted on /r/javascript, but I think it&#x27;s worth posting here too:<p>I was a member of the YUI team until a few months ago. I&#x27;m still at Yahoo now, just on a different team, but just wanted to give my own thoughts on this (I don&#x27;t represent the company or the YUI team).<p>My software engineering career started with the YUI team - I actually joined as an intern at Yahoo because of a Reddit post on /r/javascript. I was pretty new to engineering in general back then, and as a biology major with no real professional experience, I didn&#x27;t have an easy time getting internships. Jenny, the manager of the YUI team back then, really took a chance on me, and that really changed my entire career path.\nI solved a bunch of YUI bugs, added a few features here or there, and I always tried to help other folks on #yui on IRC, the mailing list, or in-person here at Yahoo, which I really enjoyed. I learned a crazy amount of JavaScript, some pretty advanced debugging / performance profiling techniques, and even gave some talks. Eventually, a lot of people always came to me first whenever they had a question about YUI, which was pretty cool.<p>From the view of some people in the JavaScript community, YUI was always considered a huge, monolithic framework that was only good for widgets. I never thought that was the case - YUI pioneered a lot of the techniques that are popular in advanced JavaScript development today, like modules, dynamic loading, and creating logical view separation in your code. A lot of the influence in RequireJS / CommonJS / ES6 modules can be seen from what YUI did first, which people used to consider &quot;over-engineering&quot;.<p>With a lot of new development in JavaScript though (data-binding, tooling like Grunt / Yeoman, promises and other async handling techniques), it was always hard for YUI to keep up with new features while still being able to maintain backwards compatibility with the constantly deploying products that people were building at Yahoo. We had to support product teams while also building out the framework at the same time, and making sure the user-facing products were the best was more important. Eventually, it was hard when developers who were familiar with newer JavaScript tools tried to use YUI, but ended up having to spend quite some time with the framework just to get it working with the rest of the JS ecosystem.<p>In the end, I wasn&#x27;t involved with this decision, but I think it was the right thing to do. A lot of the YUI (now YPT) team and other front-end teams at Yahoo are now working on helping out with more cutting-edge core JavaScript work, like internationalization (<a href=""https://github.com/yahoo/intl-messageformat"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/yahoo/intl-messageformat</a>) and ES6 modules, as well as building out components for newer frameworks like React and Ember (<a href=""https://github.com/yahoo/flux-examples"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/yahoo/flux-examples</a>). Yahoo still has a lot of really strong front-end developers, and working on these more important core components is more beneficial to both Yahoo and the JS community as a whole, than continuing to maintain a framework that&#x27;s a walled garden.<p>The one thing to take away from this is that no technology lasts forever, and in the end, what the user sees is the most important, whether it&#x27;s JavaScript, Android / iOS, or holographic smartwatches.<p>I&#x27;ll be a bit melancholy today, but I&#x27;ll raise a glass to YUI tonight.

8244510,comment,8242254,8244363,3,0,zheshishei,,,"I came here to point out this exact same thing. Why use vans and trucks to re-balance stations when you can have people re-balance them?<p>Not only can you can have dynamic pricing based upon stations and times, imagine having a feature where you can &quot;call&quot; for a bike at an empty station. There can be an app that notifies people near other close non-empty stations to ride a bike over for you. Or, you could even display it on the screen of the kiosk.<p>How would you get people to ride these bikes for re-balancing or on demand?<p>Offer something like a rewards plan (re-balance a bike X number of times and receive a discount on your next bike rental) or pay them in micro-payments (Think Tom Hanks returning luggage trolleys in <i>The Terminal</i>).<p>How could you ensure that people riding bikes on demand don&#x27;t take advantage of the process to just get a free ride to wherever?<p>First, make sure that the bike being taken out is checked into the station it&#x27;s being delivered to. Second, impose some sort of time limit in which that needs to be done. Base the time limit on an acceptable pace and take into account the distance between the stations (with a time buffer). If it exceeds that limit, it becomes a regular rental and the deliverer is charged regularly. Also, it then becomes possible to add bonus incentives for getting the bike to the station faster.<p>One particular bonus of this system is that it can leverage a city&#x27;s homeless population as a workforce. (If you disagree due to cleanliness issues, I&#x27;m sorry to tell you that the homeless already use citibikes as cycling machines). Of course, there would be a need to hedge against the possibility they may just take out a bike and never return it, since they don&#x27;t really have any sort of credit. One possibility would be to sponsor a homeless person by covering the cost of a bike and then having them operate on a &quot;one strike&quot; policy.",1409346442

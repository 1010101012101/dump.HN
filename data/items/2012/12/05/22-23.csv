You not seeing X isn't proof that X doesn't exist. Germs are too small to see, but they matter a great deal.<p>The same is true of usability. You can definitely measure it. It isn't <i>subjective</i>, but it is <i>personal</i>. Even so, it still matters, because those personal factors have a lot of regularity across individuals that can be exploited. A great example is the iPod. It wasn't the first MP3 player, and it arguably wasn't the best when it came out. But it crushed the existing players because Apple spent a lot of time on making it easy to use and slick.<p>The amazing thing to me about the iPod isn't that it was better than the competition. It's that the competition never caught up. Precisely because, like you, many of their engineers and executives never took usability seriously.",1354748307

My main use case was that I'd upload some pictures and share them to a list of family and friends of the new baby - keeping the pictures off of email and gaining some small increase in control.<p>Then we get into the problems...<p>There was no good way to bulk maintain pictures.  Horrible.  Lists?  They didn't work.  Half the time the email wouldn't be sent out to the group after I shared something.  Fail.  So, the last time I tried to use it - and realized that nobody got what I sent out, I spent an hour manually deleting every file in my account (since, again, there were no bulk interactions).  On top of that, there was no way to simply delete my account.<p>Kicksend was good in concept, but execution and reliability of it working was one of the worst of any apps I've used in the past few years.  I finally ended up switching to a Pro Flickr account and just share things via Guest Passes.  Works as expected.<p>Kicksend was something I really hoped worked well, but all it was to me ended up being a pretty UI that I couldn't trust to work at all.

This is something I do myself pretty regularly but there are conflicting things here for me.<p>The photos I usually want to print are almost never ones taken on my phone. And because the photos I actually send to people are from my camera I end up using my PC and just upload them to the company and choose the location. Costco, Walmart, Target all offer the ability to print at various locations.<p>I guess I don't see the benefit here. Driving to the store is the inconvenience in the end. That's why people attach photos or upload them on Facebook instead these days. Perhaps if it automatically snail-mailed the photo to a family member it would be more useful. But even my 70+ year old grandparents prefer I email them photos now anyway.<p>Edit - Just to add some context, I'm a father with multiple kids  with parents and grandparents who demand photos of them every day. :)",1354748107

OStatus seems to be the work of idealistic folks who hoped they could just make an open protocol and people would flock to it, solely because it was open. Predictably, that hasn't happened.

I had two interviews with a company whose software executes trades in the financial sector with extreme speed. I passed both. I was however worried about my possible position within the company, as it seemed like I would mainly be doing web development for them (this is what was described in the interview). Seeing as how the cs market is hot, I was thinking I could do better elsewhere.<p>Generally most of their employees went to ivy league schools. I never responded to their request for a third interview, as I was suspicious about how good of a position I would get in the company. Was this a stupid decision? Many of their developers are very accomplished individuals, writing really fast low latency c++ code.<p>Is it possible to get a low level job at one of these shops and expect to move into these domains of the company in the future? If so, how does one go about contacting them successfully so as to secure another interview?<p>Whats more, if one wants to get into the domain of high frequency trading, but perhaps doesn't have the pedigree to get a job outright, where is best to start? Would any old c++ developer role do? Should I target a database job? As a young intelligent individual where is best to start if one wants to maximize their income within the financial industry?( This is assuming I cannot work at Microsoft, google amazon)messed up my amazon interview.<p>Furthermore, I am looking eventually to make into a hedge fund as a developer (and lateral within the company once there).

I've found that I get intimidated and frustrated only when I'm trying to rush through something. The best method I have for slowing myself down is to keep a notebook open, and write down definitions as I go (and lemmas, and theorems, but from here on I'll just call them definitions). I try to write a definition that is more clear (likely only to myself) than how it was presented in the text I'm reading. I also try to write down important implications of the definitions.<p>I think the procedural way of thinking about mathematics is natural for someone without much exposure, and is indicative that you're still trying to work out minor details of each definition you encounter. That's fine. If you have to think about a summation as a for-loop to understand it, go for it. After seeing a bunch of summations, eventually they'll carve out their own mental space. I think that writing down definitions will also help to solidify the declarative nature of mathematics, and definitely helps me to move through math more fluidly.<p>When I'm learning new math, I find that I'm least frustrated when I plan on moving <i>very</i> slowly. I feel that I'm making good time through a mathematics text if I read a page an hour. Next time you encounter some ""real math"", grab a pen and paper and really dig in to the text.",1354747384

4879038,comment,4878356,4878356,1,0,JoelMarsh,,,"I am a UX guy who specializes in community design, and I see some fundamental areas you should work on:<p>1.) How is this better than Dribbble; a popular, well-respected site with precisely the same pitch? That's not a criticism so much as something to think about.<p>2.) You forgot half of your target audience. Community like this has two user types that support each other: designers and critiquers. Ideally the critiquers are designers too, but these are two separate behaviours, and your site is designed for one of them. You're never going to reach critical mass until you cater more to the majority (non-uploading, non-commenting lurkers).<p>3.) It's hard to browse. The start page has a few clickable images and once you choose one, you're doomed if it wasn't something you like. I bet the exit rate (Google Analytics) on that second page is through the roof... what should I do next if I didn't like it? Hit the back button? That's a no-no.<p>4.) The users are too downplayed. In a community like this, people discover the users through their content. Then they want to follow and see more, which motivates registrations. You should make it obvious who has posted each design, with a clear link to see more.<p>5.) You did a good job of selling the concept on the start page, and the path to registration is obvious and clear, but I don't want to sign up for something as time-consuming as a community without trying it and exploring a bit first. That's the part that isn't so great right now.<p>6.) I don't get the metaphor. Is it military or something?<p>7.) On a purely aesthetic level, you might consider simplifying your brand... there are a lot of colors, and mid-tones, and textures, and geometry, and it's forcing you to use lots of boxes and stuff. It's hard on the eyes. Pick a couple colors, a motif/pattern or two, and reduce, re-use, and recycle. ;)<p>Good Luck! Nice effort so far!",1354747309

Finally by the end of the decade the lump sum cost of a comparable middle class electric vehicle at the dealer (or website) will be lower than an equivalent ICE vehicle on the day that you buy it.<p>There are 2 fundamental price forces driving this phenomena - and that is peak oil, in addition to Li-on battery production related to the explosive growth of smartphones/laptops/tablets over the last decade. Indeed this is what I look for in any investment strategy - where is the falling waterfall in cost, who is going to get fucked, and who is going to ride the barrel down.

For city driving, you start with a full battery in the morning and never worry about stopping for gas (so the only place charge time matters is on the freeway).<p>The amount of time spent actually transferring liquid into the tank may only be 5 minutes.  But then you need to add the time it takes for your card to authorize, the time it takes to go inside to use the restroom and buy snacks, etc.  Then there's time it takes to get on and off the freeway (it always seems like there's a red light at the end of the off-ramp and another one to get out of the gas station).  If you stop for fast food, that adds another 10 minutes (30 for a sit-down restaurant).  Someone is sure to chime in that a gas car with three drivers and an empty container can drive 23.5 hours per day: I'm sure we've all done that at least once in college, but that mode of transport is much less appealing after one grows up.<p>My point is just that when all is said and done, the comparison is less like 5 minutes vs. 30 minutes and more like to 25-40 minutes vs. 40-50 minutes.  The electric is still slower, but not 6 times slower, and you have an excuse to eat slightly less unhealthy food.",1354746054

Assuming each possibility is equal (which is NOT true if you pick the password yourself, rather than randomly) then the entropy would be the logarithm of the no. of possibilities. Generally people use base 2, so:<p>Random 12 digits alphanumeric: 71 bits of entropy\nFour common words: 30 bits of entropy\nFive words: 60 bits of entropy<p>The multi-GPU cracker on the frontpage today would take 500,000 years to crack the 5 word password if it was stored via bcrypt (according to the article, which sadly did not specify the work factor). The four common words one, however, would fall in just four hours!<p>P.S. It isn't actually hard to remember a complex password. Almost anybody can do it! The passphrase method is actually not dissimilar to the technique I use. Say the password started ""OK53B3"" (I just generated this in LastPass). OK, let's figure out a way to remember it. OK, I thought of a way to remember the first two letters ;) 53.. 54 cards in a deck with the jokers, so we've lost a joker. ""OK, guys, we've lost a joker"" ""B3"" sounds like someone with a few missing teeth saying ""be free!"" so I'm imagining a toddler throwing the joker out of the window going ""be thfree!""<p>Very rapidly this will shortern as your memory of it strengthens with repetition (if you're entering this password every day - I recommend using a password manager so you have just one secure password you enter every day). After a few days it will be ""OK missing joker be three"" etc then just the password itself. After a bit longer it just becomes muscle memory - I couldn't actually recite it easily anymore, but I type it in seconds.<p>The important thing though from an entropy perspective is that whether you are making a story for your passphrase or for your password, the story comes second. Generate the password / passphrase and then create a story, this assures that each possibility is equal as I mentioned earlier (if they are unequal, there is less entropy).<p>Of course, I recognise that even with a good memorisation technique, passphrases still beat out f%8D( from a learning curve, ease of use, and accessibility standpoint. The reason I've stuck with the ugly and relatively short passwords is purely so I can type them in as fast as possible!",1354745886

Some advisors don't even care if you are coding in Python or in stone tables, as long as you ""have three stars in your results table"". Your comments about the quality of the computations also reminded me a lot about Ken Judd's (often ignored) arguments about paying attention to all these implementation details.<p>Good luck with your current goals, and I really hope you are more successful than within the limitations and issues of academia.<p>PS: Just out of curiosity, what were you interested on, regarding your IO research?",1354745134

4878861,comment,4878393,4878393,28,0,Homunculiheaded,,,"For anyone interest in R without a background in statistics: I would highly recommend learning the two in parallel (if not statistics first).<p>R is first and foremost a language for statistical computing. You really aren't going get much out of it without working on some interesting data/stats problems. Plus for most hacker types I think being able to play with the statistics you're learning about with R can be a great learning aid.<p>However not only is it beneficial to learn stats with R, it is imho dangerous to learn R without some stats. There's already too much research being published with were 'p-value' means ""the thing that t.test() output that I was told needs to be in the paper"".<p>Because R lets you play so freely with stats I find it a great tool to gain greater intuition about certain mathematical principles, but there is a temptation to let the tool do the work and the thinking for you.",1354745117

You need proof of insurance in order to get your registration, so on a vehicle that has no plates, there's no number to give, so wouldn't be able to get insurance.  VIN is really the way to handle it, and once you get through the ""quote"" stage to actually buying it, all the insurance companies can take any VIN (and your info, of course) and spit out how much it actually costs.  On a state by state level, I don't imagine it would be difficult to build a system to accurately compare rates.  The fact that each state has its own system of minimum requirements, as well as what can be covered, and insurance companies are isolated to a single state (the larger insurance providers are actually corporations with wholly owned subsidiaries in each state) increase this complexity when dealt with on a national level.  It's extremely similar to the issues with comparing health insurance plans.",1354744849

Whatever the criticisms, they seem to have a highly effective strategy.<p>> Trying to end filesharing is like going after marijuana users, it's a lost war whether you like it or not.<p>They can't guarantee to end it, any more than making anything illegal guarantees no-one will break the law anyway.<p>But if they can reduce it significantly, and thus provide a more credible level of protection to copyright holders, then that is still moving in the right direction. It is more in keeping with the law, which in a civilised society is usually a good thing, not least because if the law is bad then effective mass enforcement will make it necessary to fix that law instead of ignoring its flaws and having ordinary citizens risk legal sanctions by breaking it anyway.",1317905827

The list of phished card details was available through the interface and it was clear that there were some real people local to the bank who had given their name, address, card number, PIN, SSN, ... everything.<p>I decided to contact the bank.  After filling in the form for contact on their web site giving all the details of the site, I did get an email back and eventually I got someone on the phone.  This person (who said they were in charge of bank computer security) thanked me and said that they were going to try to deal with it (I had also contacted the school district whose computer was hosting the site to get it shut down).<p>I then told this person that there were real account details on the phisher site and would they like the list of people's account numbers so they could inform their customer/shut down their debit card etc.  The bank officer replied, ""No.""  As far as they were concerned the people who were that stupid got what they deserved.<p>I was flabbergasted, but couldn't do much to make the bank do something.<p>So, using the names and addresses of the people from the phishing site I managed to track a couple of them down (they were small businesses whose business addresses were available on the web) and phoned them up so they would be alerted.  They took it pretty well considering that some weird British guy was calling them from France to tell them their US bank account details were at risk.",1317904172

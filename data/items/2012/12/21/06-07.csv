An advertiser can target these things (eg: 21 year old male) but they cannot say ""Give me the profile URLs of every that likes Minecraft"" can they?<p>For example I currently have this advert displaying on Facebook: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/3p9oy.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/3p9oy.png</a>, Thinkgeek don't know who <i>I</i> am, only Facebook does. Thinkgeek provide the targeting information, Facebook execute it.<p>If this is the case, how would a company like Thinkgeek ever know to message me about Minecraft things? unless Facebook provided them with my profile, which they do not. The only way to do it would be if they were scraping profiles, which Facebook do not allow and if Facebook were to allow it they would build out such a system (targeted messages).",1356072823

So therefore you want to keep corporations invisible, and focus all anger on the government. So if you don't like something, you know, your wages are going down, you blame the government. Not blame the guys in the Fortune 500, because you don't read the Fortune 500.

The difference between zero and a very very very small quantity is not a big deal until it turns a finite number into something that is not a finite number, and then it's an infinitely big deal.  So my brain got distracted wondering ""is it <i>really</i> zero?"" until I reminded myself that the important thing is that I knew what you meant :-)<p>There are two schools of thought in teaching linear algebra.  One focuses on matrices, and the other takes the perspective of linear maps and vector spaces.  The course I took in college was all about matrices, and I didn't understand the point at all.  I hated it.  When I reviewed my linear algebra for grad school, I got a book that took the abstract approach, and it felt a lot simpler.  The linear algebra perspective on Fourier analysis is that the functions e^2isx form a basis for a vector space of functions, just like (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1) form a basis for R^3.  Any function in that vector space can be represented as a linear combination of the basis elements.  That representation is the Fourier series of the function.  There are a lot of technical details to figure out, such as which functions are in the space, exactly how to calculate the coefficients of the linear combination, and how to figure out if a given Fourier series converges, but <i>intuitively</i> you can say:<p>""The Fourier transform is simply a method of expressing a function (which is a point in\nsome infinite dimensional vector space of functions) in terms of the sum of its projections\nonto a set of basis functions.[1]""<p>There's a similar description on Wikipedia with more detail [2].<p>The neat thing is that even though Fourier transforms is a complicated subject, even though I barely scraped by learning the basics fifteen years ago, and even though I couldn't do any real calculations today to save my life, this way of looking at it is so simple that I can't forget it.  When I look at the equations I am quickly oriented:  the series is a linear combination of functions, the functions are an orthogonal basis of a vector space, and the coefficients of the linear combination are obtained by projecting the function onto the elements of the basis.  It's a good place to start if I ever need to learn something about Fourier transforms again someday.  It's also a good complement to the concrete spatiotemporal intuition that the article provides.<p>[1] <a href=""http://undergraduate.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS4240/Lectures/fourier.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://undergraduate.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS4240/Lectures...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space#Fourier_analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space#Fourier_analysis</a>",1356069635

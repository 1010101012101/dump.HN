The result of the function is 7. The depth of recursion is never greater than 18. No garbage collection takes place in the MacLisp version of this function because small fixnums are used.<p>(See <a href=""http://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/Timrep.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/Timrep.pdf</a>)<p>With such a precise description of what the benchmark tests, it's obvious (a) that it's a microbenchmark, but also (b) that it does indicate the speed of certain combinations of operations.<p>So I don't think that the title of this article is actually the takeaway message from that paper. Microbenchmarks like the Gabriel benchmarks are around for a reason.",1267005433

I have a K1, K2, iPhone Kindle, and read about 200-300 pages/week on them.  They are great for fiction, long reading, essay reading but are absolute fails when it comes to Mathematics, technical texts, diagrams, or anything with colored illustrations.<p>And, don't underestimate the amount of rapid random flipping you do in a mathematics text book - bouncing around pulling up forms for integration by parts, trying to track down lemma's for proofs, etc...    The kindle is _useless_ for rapid random page flipping - sequential or footnote read-n-back only  (The footnote navigation is actually pretty good).<p>Finally - PDFs on a kindle are converted into free form text (poorly, particularly with diagrams - a page which can normally handle about 5 diagrams on paper, can only handle 2 on a kindle) - you lose the page by page rendering, except in those rare cases where you pull them over as page-images, and trust me - fast way to bring your Kindle (K1/K2) to a screeching halt - also unreadable.<p>I have high hopes for the iPad in this space, but time will tell.  I'll be waiting in line though when it comes out.",1267004820

I wish I had the studies at hand to prove most of the conclusions.<p>I personally doubt the results laid out about Montana (in the article presented) Only on a matter of time frame, the educational practices, and the licensing protocol (that dominates american culture). People drive the way they are educated, and a LARGE part of that is from their parents. REGARDLESS of the tests and protocol new US drivers must go through.<p>HOWEVER, statistically speaking, There are things that the ""engineers"" and other nations have proven to be more effective then speed limits and warning signs. Mostly lack there of.<p>I think the problem goes beyond the laws, The designator would be the education, licensing, and philosophy of driving. Change those things in favor of the statistically correct method of driving, and well...<p>You want statistics, compare educational training across platforms and nations. Compare Money (education, licensing, upkeep, and running costs, (ie fuel)) Compare daily driving habits, (public transportation in Europe is... better, to say the least)...<p>It would be a complex algorithm to say the least...\nBut my personal conclusion would be FOR personal judgment.

It's true that people can keep safe distances without speed limits, however it's undeniable that people who go much faster than the average speed are dangerous. Limiting the speed is one way to try to get everyone to drive the same speed. It's a system and as long as everyone sticks to it, there are less accidents. If you change the system, no problem, but don't give this as an example to declare a country a police-state. Your speed is completely in your control.",1267004097

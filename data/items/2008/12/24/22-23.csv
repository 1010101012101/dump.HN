That which conceals the door is something we don't want to look at.""<p>Any of you remember the series of articles right after collapse back in early autumn of this year? There were numerous articles posted around here about fear -- whether to perservere with startups, or to cut your losses and wait until you're back on the upswing. Those were the times when all of these monsters come out of the woodwork. I had a lot of fun being able to see the manifestations of widespread panic ... even as my stomach was trying to eat its way out of my body.<p>If you can master this part of yourself, it is trivially easy to see what drives other people. It is more than social engineering. It is a hack relatively few people know about yet can give you great gifts. It is like a secret handshake when you recognize someone who has waded into the depths of his own psyche, and came back out for the better.<p>If you guys try these practices -- and it isn't limited to Buddhist meditation, either -- and get decent grip on yourself, I highly recommend going back and watching <i>Batman Begins</i>. Certain things takes on a different significance once you stop running away from your own fears.",1230159568

409209,comment,408786,408786,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"You know what, Friedman? It's a lot harder to manage a continent-spanning country of 300 million people than a tiny, rich city-state. That's where the wisdom of decentralization comes in, but we completely abandoned that in the 1930s. Can you imagine the bureaucracy to manage a country of 300 million people as well as Hong Kong? Neither can I. It probably doesn't exist.<p>The One's election to office and his promise to shovel out $1 trillion in green pork doesn't change a whole lot. Friedman says:<p>>""Because of the financial crisis, Barack Obama has the bipartisan support to spend $1 trillion in stimulus. But we must make certain that every bailout dollar, which we’re borrowing from our kids’ future, is spent wisely.""<p>There is not a single example from American history to give me hope of this.",1230159128

409205,comment,408801,409026,0,0,palish,,,"It's somewhat distressing to see that the parent comment has 8 karma points.  It suggests that there is a lot of groupthink going on here.  What was the purpose of the parent comment, other than to be a ""kick in the groin""?  Are you seriously suggesting that Zed isn't in the top 1% of humanity in intelligence?  And before you point out how many millions of people are still smarter than that, consider how many people are <i>dumber</i> than that.  99% of humanity is a lot of people!<p>So I don't see why Zed should be called dumb, and I don't see why the parent comment was upvoted.

Demonstrating how a community can work well without ego was what merb brought to the game in a way that Zed had nothing to do with.<p>There are many great hackers in the world.  Some have written code that turned out to be critical to our everyday hacking lives.  Zed seems to think that because he wrote one piece of software that has been used a lot (its really just a small blip on the ""used a lot"" scale) that he has the right to constantly remind everyone of this.  Seriously, do the authors of VIM, openssh, firebug, etc... constantly remind us that we owe a debt to them by listening to their rants?<p>The bottom line is if Zed had not have written mongrel, someone else would.  No hacker is irreplaceable.",1230158604
409199,comment,408793,409130,0,0,kwamenum86,,,"That's my point though.  Even extremely smart people can stumble on a dense abstract.  It is the nature of language- just because I know what I mean does not mean that you do.  Even if you write something that can only be interpreted correctly in one way, there is still room for misinterpretation or total lack of understanding.<p>I was really trying to say that if a paper with no meaning made it through screening (no matter how light) then maybe the papers are too dense.<p>In response to 1), I have always found that scientific papers provide more verbose explanations for even simple concepts.  I have reread entire paragraphs three times only to discover that I already have a firm grasp of the concept being discussed and can explain it in a single sentence.  But it probably just depends on the author and the verbosity could be explained by your 2): removing all uncertainty by explaining exactly what you mean.",1230158544

409192,comment,407555,408512,0,0,qaexl,,,"I think authors would benefit from <i>Elements</i>, though like all strategies, should not be taken as ideology. Apply where necessary. Even Hemmingway did not stick to strictly minimalism.<p>We can also go off on a tangent, and talk about how Strunk & White was published right at the end of the Victorian era, when WWI essentially wiped out the Romanticism ideals of that era. Something similar happened in America after the American Civial War. Mark Twain's writing became darker, gritter -- <i>clearer</i> -- when compared to his earlier works. Post-Civil War, no one wanted to trumpet the glories of war. It took the Europeans another seventy years to catch up. (My little excursion falls apart because both Strunk and White were Americans).<p>I could compare this to martial arts training. Newbies are aweful to look at. They have so much wasted motion. Economy of movement suggests mastery of the art form. Masters condense sophistication into simple movements, fully aware of their potential. They do not merely have simple movements.<p>My main point though, is that there are other skills in writing novels not found in Strunk & White. Good expressive technique does not make a good story. I may agree that <i>Elements</i> is worth using. I don't agree it is the <i>only</i> guide you should study.",1230158127

You have as much chance making the front page of Digg (or a popular subreddit) as you do getting your preferred policies enacted by the government - essentially zero. Having your voice heard in a crowd of millions is hard. Those that succeed usually hack the system.<p>The position that there is no conflict between competing interests in a democracy because ""everybody has a voice"" is BS (not that I would expect such arguments from this crowd). You can ask my sister who was outvoted for 18 years by my brother and I, the Sunnis and Kurds in Iraq, the Tamils in Sri Lanka, or the Republicans in DC about how great a job democracy does of balancing competing interests.",1230157116

7968645,comment,7964255,7966874,1,0,YZF,,,"I think the sum would be of more interest than a weighted average.  The specific comparison between Vancouver and Seattle is almost meaningless for various reasons:<p>- Nobody rents furnished accommodation in Vancouver, BC.  It&#x27;s almost unheard of.<p>- You can buy your TV across the border and bring it over (same for microwave).<p>- Food will generally be more expensive in Vancouver.<p>- Gas will be more expensive in Vancouver.<p>- If you buy a house here expect to pay a lot more in Vancouver for a comparable property.<p>- Taxes are higher (though you do get services in return).<p>EDIT: As someone who is pretty familiar with both areas I would expect it to be cheaper to live in the Greater Seattle area vs. the Greater Vancouver area.  There&#x27;s a lot of YMMV though.",1404176383

7968642,comment,7968124,7968124,2,0,ggreer,,,"I just started <i>When the Air Hits Your Brain: Tales from Neurosurgery</i>[1]. The author is a neurosurgeon and an excellent writer.<p>The last book I read was Abdel Haleem&#x27;s translation of the Qur&#x27;an[2]. For an ancient religious text, it&#x27;s rather short. Total reading time was maybe 16 hours over the course of a week. I&#x27;m not religious, but it was interesting to get a better idea of what Muslims believe and why. That said, the whole thing reads like a 7th-century version of Time Cube. I came away with the impression that the author was a schizophrenic who knew of parts of the Bible.<p>The most useful book I&#x27;ve recently read is Steve Blank&#x27;s <i>Four Steps to the Epiphany</i>[3]. It&#x27;s a more structured version of a lot of the stuff I learned in YC.<p>My favorite books of the past year are <i>Confessions of a Yakuza</i>[4] and <i>Infidel</i>[5]. The subjects of each book are as different as can be, but their stories are quite captivating. Both survived immense suffering and managed to thrive afterwards. Reading those books reminded me of how lucky I am and how insignificant my problems are.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/When-Air-Hits-Your-Brain-ebook/dp/B006WOFB5C/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/When-Air-Hits-Your-Brain-ebook/dp/B006...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Quran-Oxford-Worlds-Classics-ebook/dp/B001ODEPPI/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Quran-Oxford-Worlds-Classics-ebook/dp/...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steve-Blank-ebook/dp/B00FLZKNUQ/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steve-Blank-ebook/...</a><p>4. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Yakuza-Junichi-Saga-ebook/dp/B003YL3PPY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Yakuza-Junichi-Saga-ebook/...</a><p>5. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Infidel-Ayaan-Hirsi-Ali-ebook/dp/B000NY12CI/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Infidel-Ayaan-Hirsi-Ali-ebook/dp/B000N...</a>",1404176245

The 1990-91 ruin is still largely with &quot;us&quot; if you were one of the unfortunate ~10% there, otherwise you may not even notice, this is by \ndesign.\nEarly 2000&#x27;s there is a little downward noise, lots of dotcoms and their dependents, but 2008-09 were the worst thing since the Nixon Recession, a huge new group whose futures&#x27;s ruined for decades to come.<p>Since each significant spike destroys a different block of consumers, this is adding up, estimate totalling up to almost a majority of consumers who are not just compromised but ruined by now.<p>And that&#x27;s not all, Nixon was so incompetent that the currency had to be sacrificed too and that does not appear on the chart.  This was huge.<p>Surprises are in store if you have not yet felt the wrath from 5 years ago.\nThere is nothing more for currency to contribute, loss of property values since then has not extracted its toll proportional to negative area so something else will have to give, and it will have to be big.",1404174674

Which we&#x27;ve seen for men for decades, and women as well recently. We&#x27;ve dealt with this by a hodgepodge of measures, from a hacky attempt to patch those weak portions of the labor market using SSDI; to kids living in their parents&#x27; basements and sharing their family health insurance; to extending unemployment for periods much longer than it was originally designed; to encouraging early retirement. We&#x27;ve muddled through, basically. As the tendency intensifies, it&#x27;d be worthwhile to figure out a solid way to rationalize and optimize all those programs.<p>Your other points I&#x27;m in broad agreement with. More and more of the economy will shift from hierarchical, institution-oriented &quot;jobs&quot; to something more freeform. This effectively amounts to shifting management and monitoring costs to the individual instead of the organization, which I think makes loads of sense and is a practice that&#x27;ll end up outcompeting others. I don&#x27;t think the average worker will end up screwed in the next ten or thirty years. I&#x27;d expect that a surprisingly large number of them will be working in autonomous jobs outside of corporate environments.<p>But many of those new freeform activities will be marginal, and many of them will involve barter as compensation or even be wholly uncompensated.<p>So, I&#x27;m not so sanguine about the bottom 20%: even if we do manage to revamp our education system to deal with contemporary economic problems better (a huge, giant if that&#x27;d take decades to implement), it&#x27;ll take time to replace the whole workforce (40 years!), and there will always be students who end up performing significantly below average. Retraining programs of older workers haven&#x27;t shown exceptionally promising results, either.<p>One of the things I like a lot about the Basic Income is that it provides a way for those displaced workers to experiment with new ways of work without the vigilant eye of the State trying to shove them into legible, easily-taxed, and controlled corporate employment.",1404174087

However, it is clear that No-IP knew nothing about even the lawsuit until they lost control of their domains, as this was specifically ordered by the court.<p>Also, there is no answer as to whether transferring control over domain names from a defendant to a plaintiff is something that courts should be empowered to do as part of a temporary restraining order.  I hope a lawyer with some knowledge in this area can chime in to answer that question.",1404173172

I bought a guitar a little over ten years ago, got some starter pointers from a passing acquaintance, then spent ten years picking up the guitar every few months, pounding out some open chords reading tabs, and not progressing at all. Bought various software to help (guitar pro, rocksmith) which is good software, but doesn&#x27;t correct bad habits.<p>Finally I got tired of just being shit and went to a teacher. Almost every lesson he&#x27;s correcting a bad habit or providing insight into what I personally am doing incorrectly, and the practice I&#x27;m am given each fortnight relates to improving those specific weaknesses. Rocksmith is a hell of a lot of fun, but it&#x27;s also quite sloppy in what it expects and you can get away with horrible habits (despite this, it&#x27;s a very impressive bit of software). Guitar Pro is good for isolating the track you want to play in a popular song and repeating things to get the timing right. But for me, personally, it&#x27;s a meatspace teacher that is making the difference. A teacher isn&#x27;t cheap - one lesson is roughly the same as the software above - but I can see which of my skills are progressing and by how much.<p>The journey is interesting. I&#x27;m smart, but have no penchant for applying elbow grease. I&#x27;m used to picking things up quickly... and the skills in playing a musical instrument well can&#x27;t be gained in a short time - you have to put in the hours. It&#x27;s also interesting that the more I learn about the instrument, the further away the target of &#x27;doesn&#x27;t suck&#x27; seems to get :)",1404173023

Or the scheme they call flex, which is to pay a great deal of the salary as extras (even up to 80%) because these do not get taxed.

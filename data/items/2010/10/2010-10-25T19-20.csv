1831363,comment,1830929,1830929,0,0,mgrouchy,,,"I'm not sure where you find these people, generally you will find the small subset of students who do projects outside of class work generally work on the web because these are things that can be most easily shared with peers.<p>In my university, we did mostly Java(that was the ""teaching language"" that is used), I only did 3 courses that were primarily taught in C and there were only around 2 more courses that required C.<p>So what generally happens to most CS students is that they teach you Java in your first year and then any course where they tell you to use whatever language you prefer they choose Java, because thats what they are comfortable with and they have assignment/project deadlines looming, so they don't feel they have time to experiment in a new language.<p>Your best bet is to hire workterm/Internship students whom you can Train. It might seem like a waste, but its a real cheap way to get an idea of how good the person is, you get them early enough to train some bad habits out of them(if they exist) and evaluate whether they would be a good fit for your company. They also may accomplish something awesome along the way?<p>I did a 16 month internship before I graduated from University(which was really an 8 month extended to 16 month), most students like myself set up these internships in a way that after the internship they only have 1 semester of classes remaining, so they can ideally work part time with the company they internet with for that final 4 months and hopefully turn their internship into a fulltime Job upon completion.",1288036752

EASTL has a different allocator specification which is simpler, more efficient, more flexible, and easier to use than std::allocator. Both std::allocator and eastl::allocator are described below. EASTL follows the defect reports and TR1 as well. EASTL additionally provides and uses some of the TR1 functionality as well, including most significantly the smart pointers, type traits, and hashing containers.<p>Second, EASTL provides extension functionality to the above containers, iterators, and algorithms. An example of this is the push_back(void), set_capacity(size), and validate() functions added to eastl::vector. The majority of these extensions are driven by the need for higher performance (push_back(void)), higher clarity (set_capacity), or higher debuggability (validate()). There are about 30 such extensions to the various entities in the library. These are described in detail below.<p>Third, EASTL provides additional containers and algorithms that don't correspond to std STL. These include intrusive_list, vector_map, fixed_hash_set, slist, ring_buffer, radix_sort, has_trivial_relocate, and others. These are described in detail below.<p>There are additional differences not related to the functional specification. They include a programming philosophy that emphasizes readability, consistency, and optimal performance on limited hardware.",1288036744

1831297,comment,1829428,1829428,0,0,michaelchisari,,,"I couldn't agree with this rant more.  I use frameworks because they streamline my code, and provide basic abstractions for simple tasks.  One of my biggest issues with Rails (to be fair, it's more about people new to rails), is the way it sees abstraction as a form of magic.  Simple tasks should be abstracted, but abstracting complex tasks is a recipe for disaster down the line, when you need to operate outside of the confines of the abstraction. This can be mind-numbinglyannoying for experienced programmers, and frustrating for new programmers.<p>I do want to address specifically the idea of abstracting out things like HTML or SQL.  These are my two pet peeves.  I look at something like HAML, and I can't understand why anyone would consider that to be a good idea, even putting aside the fact that your designer will have to learn a whole new syntax, but the idea that markup should look like programming language defeats the point of a markup language.<p>Here's how I did it with Appleseed, using the simple_html_dom library.  Views are dumb, very dumb.  You create a view which is only markup, for instance:<p><a href=""http://github.com/appleseedproj/appleseed/blob/master/components/friends/views/friends.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/appleseedproj/appleseed/blob/master/compon...</a><p>So you properly class and id your markup, and in the controller, you populate the data, repeating elements for lists or tables, by targetting the dom.<p>If I want to set the title on this view, I do:<p><i>$View = $this->GetView ( 'friends');<p>$View->Find ( '.profile-friends-title', 0 )->innertext = ""New Title"";</i><p>That's it.  No template pseudo-code, designers only have to care about the markup itself. On the front-end, I do the same with Javascript.  Think of it as unobtrusive PHP.<p>I also stay away from ORM's.  I understand all the arguments in favor, but in the end, I'd much prefer writing complex joins than using an ORM.<p>Separation of concerns is so important, and yet, sometimes I think frameworks, which are supposed to facilitate that, actually can make it worse, by trying to reinvent the wheel in abstract ways.",1288035870

But I think most schools are avoiding C, outside of specific classes (whose goal is to teach C or something C related), because students get caught up in the complexity of C, and the difficulty of debugging it vs. a memory managed language, so they'd rather just avoid it and focus the class on the topic it's supposed to cover.<p>On the other hand, I know a few people who want to solely work in C because it allows them so much control over how things work, and they're capable of understanding how each and every call they make will basically function.

The US is still hanging over the precipice of a deflationary recession/depression, that only massive government stimulus and Fed intervention has been able to prevent so far, but it's not clear how permanent that success is.  Way too much bad debt in the system that is tending toward default, and Foreclosuregate isn't helping.<p>In deflation, the cost of debt is exacerbated.  The payments and interest stay the same, but there's less money in the economy, hence increased odds of lower income, hence increased odds that the same debt consumes a larger portion of your income.<p>Don't get caught with your pants down should things go south, get rid of it.",1288034206

A few courses down the line (OS, Security) tend to use C, but it does certainly depend on the instructor.  It seems to me that instructors shy away from C when they know students will likely have little experience with it.  They don't want to be bothered with teaching students what a pointer is because it will take away from the actual material of the course.<p>That said, I personally enjoy using C when it seems to be appropriate.  I would much rather write a piece of OS code in C and drop it into a linux distro than using Java to do something that would rarely be used in the real world.  I've had problems with C that I wouldn't in a language like python, but if the task is better suited for C, I'd rather work through those problems and learn because of it.  My personal opinion of students not learning C because it's hard is that they don't belong in a CS program.

So many intelligent people in different areas have many exciting ideas and they need YOUR help to do it.<p>Averaging out what I have earned the past three years, I haven't made more or less money than I did at the job I quit. However, there are certain other benefits -- I haven't set an alarm clock in over three years, I am outside in the sun right now on my laptop enjoying a beer, I have a small amount of equity in a few businesses, and I haven't had to do a ""self evaluation"" or had an Outlook calendar constantly open that is scheduled with many meetings about meetings. That said, I have also been up working at 2am many days in the past few months, haven't had a paid vacation, have been paid late many times, have no idea what I'm going to be doing in December, and there are many apps and servers running that have my name on them and could go wrong any minute, and I haven't been able to expand into something bigger. Good times!<p>My advice to you: convince 3 people to pay you money before you quit. If you can't find the clients now, then you will still have trouble when you quit.

Take on a small side gig or two while you're at your current job to work in your off hours.  This will give you a taste of what independent consulting is like and the challenges involved.  Also, in independent consulting people don't care about certification, they care about you solving their problems.<p>Also, your questions of ""Who wants to hire someone for less than a year?"" makes it sounds like you're a good candidate for third party agency consulting.  That's where Company A doesn't want to commit to a full time employees, so they hire a consultant from Company B. You're considered a temporary employee for Company B while working at Company A.  Contract terms are usually fixed, but will often go month to month once the initial term is up.  Some are often contact-to-hire.  Certification will help you negotiate your rate with Company B, but isn't necessary, and there's a HUGE number of .NET jobs that use this kind of consulting.<p>The downside is the consulting firm (Company B) takes a chunk of money before passing you a check. The counter-point is these firms often get contracts that would never be handed out on an independent consultant, and  the upside for you is 40/hours a week of stable employment for a period of time, and a loose commitment that makes it easier to do side work and/or plan for your future.

I wrote a multi-threadded crawler in C because using perl or shell scripts wrapped with xargs is not very efficient.  I love working with C mainly because I grew up writing C code and I find it very convenient.  I have a favorite debugger.  I love using linked lists.  I think that constructing a complex in-memory data structure to make a program run efficiently is an art form.  Also, I believe that using BerkeleyDB is also a much better option for a database from a programming aspect.  BerkeleyDB (like C) has been around for ever, it's fast, it has low-overhead, and it does things just as good as any other key/value database (if not better because it's so mature).  Using older, more proven technologies is slowly becoming my overall programming philosophy.  I'm not a new graduate, but I still feel that these methodologies are much better in many circumstances than the newer tools that are all the rage when performance and reliability are an issue.  Sometimes, I even re-code regexps using pcre in C to make them fast if they're a bottleneck so I can squeeze some more performance out of my code.  When I'm prototyping something, I still revert back to perl or php though - they're great for quick and dirty tasks still.",1288033503

With WPA2+AES you basically open a public/private key encrypted connection to the router (similar to SSL) and exchange the PSK in order to authorize the client.

But you know, if I meet someone who calls themselves a ""C Programmer,"" I would be surprised if they were trying to build a client-side web application as a browser plug-in in C. C Programmers tend to ply their trade in places where their skills provide value, so ""using C for all of <i>their</i> programming needs"" might work out with very little difficulty, just as a carpenter would be unlikely to try to wire a house.<p>Then again, there's nothing like expanding your horizons a little.

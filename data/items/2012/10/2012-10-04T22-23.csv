Even simple repeats can have a lot of overhead if not used correctly, have a look at ""Looking Inside The Regex Engine"" at this link <a href=""http://www.regular-expressions.info/repeat.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.regular-expressions.info/repeat.html</a>. An equivalent parser doesn't need to do any form of backtracking, and doesn't care about the structure. For example, I've seen an application use regular expressions for html parsing. After spending a while figuring out what they actually did, I found the source html had changed its whitespace, but not the DOM structure, which broke the regular expressions.<p>As for my reasoning above, I think a lot of 'abstraction' libraries would be faster by operating directly on the data, instead of just converting it to regular expressions. The beauty of regular expressions is the speed at which they can be written.",1349391417

If you have a random data analysis problem that would take your computer three weeks, why not just pay $10 and get it done in two hours (plus a few hours of debugging)?<p>If the article is correct, Amazon paid 15 million for those cards which will be out of style in about two years (not that they have to get rid of them, but something faster, easier to maintain (if Nvidia starts opening up to Linux), with more memory and less power usage will come out. They'll have to fork over a large sum of money again to keep their top ""on demand computing"" title.<p>Amazon's cluster GPU right now has two Nvidia Tesla Fermi's in it. I'm going to assume Amazon will split their new cards into twos and fours, at about half of each. That's ~1750 new computers that are going to load up. Looking at the current rates of the cluster, it's $2.100 for an hour of the normal, I'll say it will be $4.200 for an hour on the jumbo with 4 GPUs.<p>They paid $15 million for just the cards. They need to get 2380952 hours of usage out of the machines to break even on the cards. They need to log 1360 hours per machine to break even, or have someone run all the machines at full bore for 56 days. As the cards are the most expensive component (assumption), and the total price of the computer will be about the price of one of the cards, we'll add a little bit of over head for all the other things they need to do to make it work - 120 days of full time use to break even on an investment of about $25 million (they need to buy lots of other things to put all the GPUs in, and worry about all that heat, and have a place to put it all, and have people install the new computers, etc...). I wonder what the actual usage of those clusters are, and if they've had anyone sign a deal saying we'll use the cluster for an entire month. That's a beautiful maneuver though, say CERN didn't want to do all the data analysis from the LHC in house because by the time they got to this part of the experiment, their technology they purchased previously would be way out of date. Just let Amazon do it. They will always have the latest technology, and you'll have an inexpensive way of leveraging that power.<p>Assuming they can make it all work (and I'm sure a lot of their decisions now are strategic decisions aimed at future investments) this is a great time to be a computer user, log on and get the best for a couple hours for a couple dollars. Instead of shelling out $1500 on a new computer personally, I could log a ton of EC2 hours getting significantly faster, more powerful machines, that never get 'stale', and their lives are much happier (my computer probably doesn't do anything ""intensive"" 70% of its life, whereas the EC2s are probably pushed a bit harder than that).",1349390833

But let me tell you how the rest of us do it.  You wake up with a headache because you spent last night dreaming about all the meetings you had the day before. You chug your coffee hoping the headache will go. You spend 15 minutes catching up on emails and if you are lucky 15 on reading tech blogs and then the misery begins. In 15 minutes increments you jump from coding project 1 to a meeting to fixing project 2 to a meeting to learning about the domain of project 3 ... And then some douchebag in a meeting says why don't we use technology X and spend many days learning about it to build something we could've coded in couple of hours.  And then management says why don't we use technology Y because all the douchebags on the internet are talking about it. You try to make you case that we don't need any of that i.e. we don't need to use Hibernate for COUPLE of select/update/delete queries SQL is not that evil! and then even though most of the team agrees with you, no one has the guts to say it out loud.

We can't quantify the economic damage of climate change precisely, but we know enough to know it won't be $0, which is what the ""wait and see"" point of view prices the cost as.<p>Also, climate change isn't even the big issue here. I'm talking about much more mundane and also much more damaging air and water pollution from factories, cars, etc. We have very solid empirical evidence about that. Did you know that after the EPA's ban on leaded gasoline, blood lead levels in children dropped by a factor of 3-5x in just one decade? See: <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/ace/body_burdens/b1-graph.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epa.gov/ace/body_burdens/b1-graph.html</a>. This corresponds to a multiple IQ-point impact from lead. What's the dollar value of a multiple IQ-point impact on the nation's children (and future workforce)? It's a huge number.<p>Did you know that a recent Harvard Medical School study concluded that the true price of coal power factoring in the externalized environmental costs is 2-3x as much as the market price? <a href=""http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/green/greenblog/2011/02/new_harvard_study_looks_at_ful.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/green/greenblog/2011/02/new_...</a>. The same study found the total externalized costs of coal power to be $200-$500 billion/year: <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05890.x/full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010....</a>. Here in Chicago we recently shut down two coal-fired power plants that were causing $100 million in health damage per year and only creating 50-60 jobs each.<p>The total cost of environmental damage being down every year, in terms of quantifiable impact to people is probably into the trillion dollar per year range. People tend to think of environmentalism as being about ""soft values"" but that couldn't be further from the truth. Even if we assign zero value to the environment itself, we can't avoid putting a dollar figure on the value of the services the environment provides us. When New York manages to avoid building a $6-$8 billion filtration facility by properly managing the Catskills watershed, we can't avoid the inescapable economic conclusion that damage to the Catskills and similar watersheds needs to be valued in the billions of dollars range. We can't avoid the conclusion that when a company dumps waste into those watersheds, it's an economic injury no different than if tore up city streets or caused a bridge to collapse.<p>It's the government's job to protect us from all this, the same as it's the government's job to protect us from people who steal your car or break into our houses.

If the former decreases more than the latter increases, GDP goes down.  Even if GDP goes up, GDP per capita can go down.<p>Suppose we start with 100% workers and then double the population while keeping the number of workers constant AND making them 25% more productive.  The result is 25% more GDP but less GDP per person because there are twice as many people.<p>> Regarding state and local taxes in 2050, they are included in the $19 trillion figure.<p>In other words, they're part of the 19%.  Which means that the current average rate is no where near 38%.<p>You're claiming that nearly doubling the average tax burden will have no effect.  I'm pointing out that you're actually proposing something closer to 3.5x.<p>Even if we assume that you're correct, why do you think that Americans will pay those taxes?  Note that your ""the numbers work for the economy as a whole"" argument is irrelevant to what an individual does.<p>The Clinton welfare reforms as well as current experience with unemployment benefits shows that legal employment is sensitive to fairly small amounts of money.  How likely is it that it's insensitive to large amounts of money?<p>Yes, an interesting fraction of folks will go off book.  They'll contribute to GDP but they won't be paying taxes.  So, you'll need even higher rates on the ""taxed GDP"" which will push more folks off the book.<p>Yes, I realize that you're claiming that the remaining workers will have more after-tax than they have today but that's not how people think.  High tax rates make evasion more profitable and generous payments to non-workers make not working more attractive.",1349389825

2. it doesn't appear to be loading the data as you scroll around the map - it loads it all at once up front. of course it's nice that you don't have to wait for it to load as you scroll, but that means there's an upper bound to the number of listings you can search through, and just goes to show how incomplete their implementation is. i'm guessing that's why it isn't offered in NY yet - too many listings to serve all at once",1349389107

This stops you from getting addresses in Queens and whatnot which also fall under ""New York City"" and ""NYC"" city names.  More people walk nav those areas, which is why they tend to be offered before the Manhattan ones.<p>For my own walking map, I use ""Exit Strategy"", which shows the NYC neighborhood street maps with the subway stations marked so you can see all the entrances and exits.  This app also tells you which car of the subway to get on to be right at the street exit you want at the end of your ride.

Hell, in this study they found a statistically significant IQ drop (over the course of 20 years) for adolescent-onset users that only smoked 14 days out of the year on average (the median, to be precise).  Even if they do put forth incomplete or questionable conclusions, teens should be exposed to more of these findings and be allowed to think for themselves.

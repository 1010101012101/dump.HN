You shop with the earth in mind, so we then take that mentality further in donations and service projects in making a difference. This will begin to positively affect people who shop online as well as those who receive donations from the 10% we donate from each sale. So the strength of Daily Green Project is threefold: giving money to something you believe in, positively effecting the environment around you, and donating to charities that help to make the world a better place for everyone.<p>Daily Green Project members will also be doing hands on work to help non-profit organizations like Habitat for Humanity thrive in their giving. To support this program, we will take $1 of every sale and put it in our “DGP Fund”. This fund is for us to use as if we were one of the organizations you chose to donate to.",1207630211

157570,comment,157204,157204,0,0,slapshot,,,"Seems to vastly over-simplify the problem down to an alleged evil-doer that wants to destroy the world.  The markets are a lot more complex than that; short-selling has value as a tool to correct excessively high prices.  Correct (as in ""reliable"" or ""indicative of actual value"") prices make the market move efficiently.  Efficiency isn't some abstract good, it's what makes raising capital possible.  It protects buyers from buying over-inflated stocks.  It increases liquidity, etc.<p>Of course, there is some point at which any practice can be destructive, but the problem isn't short-sales; it's abusive short sales.  And there's no one evil-doer.",1207630054

157568,comment,157357,157538,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Well, realistically I'm not sure if it would make a difference since GPA is such a tenuous concept to begin with. To quote Dressel, ""A grade can be regarded only as an inadequate report of an inaccurate judgment by a biased and variable judge of the extent to which a student has attained an undefined level of mastery of an unknown proportion of an indefinite amount of material."" This quote is actually from 1956; today it would be inaccurate since most classes factor some combination of attendance, homework, and participation into the grade. (To get GPA you just average all of those together using an arbitrary weighting scheme.) That's why (IIRC) GPA only accounts for about 3% of expected future earnings.<p>If you really wanted to figure out the value of the SAT you would have to use a much more robust measure of cognitive development than freshman GPA. However, it doesn't look like anyone is going to undertake such a massive project anytime soon. Incidentally, Alfie Kohn has some really good stuff to say about grades in both Punished By Rewards and also in What Does It Mean To Be Well Educated?<p>Also, I should have mentioned above that there are some meta-studies that find that degree of validity depends on the person's race, and that if you take the person's race into account the test can be useful. I have multiple objections to this though, both practical and theoretical.",1207629749

This isn't an issue of ""Not enough people are taking these courses, so let's cull them."" It's an issue of ""We're spending a lot of money on very few students. We can probably use that money to help more students.""<p>I'm a CS PhD student. I think it's terrible that they have to cut some CS AP classes. But I also understand that they have a limited budget, and a mandate to help as many students as possible with that budget. It's easy to criticize them for cutting classes we think are valuable, but we aren't faced with the problem of trying to use a finite budget to cover classes in the sciences, math, history, literature, languages and the arts.",1207628484

157535,comment,157269,157398,0,0,sah,,,"It seems to me that the Python fans in this argument are conflating two separate concerns here:<p>1)  Requiring <i>self</i> for access to member variables and methods is a great idea, and is why Hungarian notation like <i>m_foo</i> for a member called <i>foo</i> is popular in languages that don't require it.  Ruby does this with <i>@</i>, which is also nice because it's short; I know people who use <i>m_foo</i> in C++ because it's shorter than <i>this.foo</i>, and while I don't agree with them, I can kind of see how a shorter prefix would be nice.  But Ruby does lose points in my book for not requiring <i>self</i>/<i>@</i> for access to object-local methods.<p>2) Requiring <i>self</i> as an explicit parameter in method definitions confuses the living crap out of newbies.  I've seen this several times in the real world.  Try explaining it to someone who doesn't yet understand OOP sometime, it's a disaster.  On the other hand, making <i>self</i> a magic keyword that gets you the present object, the way Java and C++ handle <i>this</i>, is less confusing, less typing, and has a perfectly nice symmetry between the scope of the definition (method <i>foo</i> is declared on objects of class <i>Bar</i>) and the namespace visible in the call (<i>bar.foo()</i> calls a method <i>foo</i> on the <i>bar</i> object).  In contrast, <i>self</i> looks like an explicit parameter in the definition, but doesn't look that way in the call.  If you want <i>def foo(self)</i>, I think the consistent thing is to do like CLOS and call it like <i>foo(bar)</i> rather than <i>bar.foo()</i>.  If you want <i>bar.foo()</i>, something like <i>def self.foo()</i> would be less confusing.",1207627592

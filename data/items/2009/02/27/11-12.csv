It gives the impression of a one-man shop, which prospective clients will, in most cases, try to avoid.",1235735413

The problem is that the arguments are very ill-considered.<p>You can say <i>any</i> law is job-killing -- a legal prohibition on murder puts all the assassins out of business.  Damn the government!  As for the ""enviro impact fees"", that's life.  We can't just keep raping the environment and expect our kids to fix the problem.  We need to pay for it now.<p>Nobody <i>wants</i> to pay taxes, but if we want to keep our society around for more than a few more years, it's a necessary evil.",1235734209

It's popular to the point that its ridiculous. \nNow you may wonder why are the sales are so poor. A casual walk into a mobile shop will show you. It's variety. There are too many phones to choose from. While the iPhone still wins hands down in sleekness, there are a host of other decent phones (with greater capabilities) to choose from.<p>So there is no 'hate' involved, it just boils down to market saturation of comparable phones.\nApple took a piss in the sea...no surprises on the results.",1235733792

497116,comment,495992,496685,0,0,herval,,,"in this specific case, it's a bit more than 'just because you can'. Maybe it can be more like 'just because you don't want to have bugs popping around when you add new servers to your infrastructure because you forgot to setup a cronjob'<p>also, other languages usually offer the same kind of stuff - like Java EE's cron-like mechanisms, for instance (with or without DSLs)..",1235733530

I work in an environment where we have serious vendor lock-in and the people in charge of infrastructure have a real fear of change. I have free reign to implement in any improvements in our performance and code so long as I don't make things difficult for them.<p>Thus, the idea of a MySQL cache system is something I've been planning to look at for a while as it plays with the existing infrastructure.

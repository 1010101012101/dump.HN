Our code base is over 100K of human written code.<p>The major library gaps were a time library (you can find a version of what we have been thinking about releasing at <a href=""https://github.com/time-cube/time-cube"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/time-cube/time-cube</a>). We use our own build system that drives cabal and ghc. Otherwise having many libraries is just painful.<p>We found that composing applications as conduits to be a very effective design pattern that minimizes many laziness issues. Monad transformers are very powerful but the machinery for them (like forking) is not fully cooked.<p>Maintaining the codebase is far easier with haskell than with anything else I have worked with (C/C++,C#,Java,etc...). Refactoring in Haskell is great.<p>You can&#x27;t fight the language. Fighting with Haskell will cause great pain.

You&#x27;re not Magyars freely riding across the plains any more, if indeed you ever were.<p>The Roma are not your problem, man, no matter how many knife attacks there are - and I know there are. But there aren&#x27;t as many as you think, and there are plenty of violent attacks in the other direction, like people burning Roma houses down with the Roma still in them.<p>As to your point of Jobbik rallies in Roma cities - yeah, that&#x27;s true as far as official rallies go. I do quite clearly remember a strongly Jobbik demonstration over near the Tisza last year that was not exactly sunshine and butterflies, though. Hatred does not pay.<p>And if you think the taxes going to support Roma kids are sapping your economic strength - there are a few ethnic Magyarok who stole 100 trillion forint from you thirty years ago and still have it. You could stack every Roma baby  in the world end to end and they wouldn&#x27;t be as tall as that.  Those guys are your enemy, and <i>they are Magyar</i>, not Roma.<p>Jobbik is misguided, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re <i>fundamentally</i> misguided. Their nationalistic principles show promise, like I say. Somebody has to start keeping the money in-country, and they&#x27;d be likely to work on that if they can get their heads out of their asses long enough.<p>Add to that the fact that Jobbik will have to be part of a coalition if they do gain more representation in Parliament (there&#x27;s no danger whatsoever of a Jobbik supermajority!), and that would temper them a little and let them learn about government, and I think there&#x27;s hope for the future.<p>Hungary has only been newly independent for twenty years. They&#x27;ve got time to make a few mistakes before everybody has any right to throw up their hands and say they can&#x27;t be trusted.<p><i>All that said</i>, yeah - your topmost point about the rhetoric used to paint the Jobbik as a threat is 100% dead on.  They&#x27;re all just Nazis reborn!  Look at the laws Hungary is passing!  Oh, wait, that&#x27;s another party?  Oh, well, all Hungarians are the same anyway.",1371581362

That requires a wage of $9 per day, which is well above the $1 per day poverty limit. On an annual basis, that comes down to $3,240 per day, more than the per capita GDP of some of the countries outside the US to which you are likely referring [1].<p>What about at scale? A 14 oz. tin of Ensure powder costs $9 at Walmart [2]. It provides 7 servings, which comes out to $1.29 per meal or $3.30 per day. Cheaper, but still not quite there - It would need to sell for < 1/3 retail price to feed those living in poverty[3].<p>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s possible to supply Ensure/Soylent at a sufficient price, especially if you subsidize it heavily through government programs or charity.

As of 6-12 months ago I don&#x27;t think the LXC on any distro was particularly secure.<p>AFAIK you have to add SELinux yourself, and all the PaaS providers are probably doing something custom (or not).  The newer thing seems to be seccomp filters (<a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/494252/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/494252/</a>), which are motivated by ChromeOS.  I would like to see a comparison; from what I can tell seccomp is a lot simpler conceptually, although there are fewer user space tools for it.<p>The article didn&#x27;t actually say &quot;LXC&quot; but it seems to be what most PaaS providers are using.  When I tried LXC, while lighter than VMs, it also seemed too heavy, because you end up with 5 or 6 processes (starting with an  &quot;init&quot;) for every process you want to run.  Using just raw namespaces and cgroups seems to be feasible although again there are few tools to do that.  Apparently systemd has support, although I don&#x27;t use any distros with it.<p>Docker is also a new thing, but I think it is just on top of LXC, so it is only as secure as your distro&#x27;s LXC is.",1371579192

I got downvoted to hell for expressing similar opinions before but I think this is a perfectly reasonable opinion.<p>Facebook is in the business of social networking, not activism.<p>The number of users using Tor compared to the general population is bound to be so low that they either shouldn&#x27;t care enough to bother blocking it <i>or</i> if they did for some reason, really wouldn&#x27;t put a dent in their daily actives.<p>Activists very well could be screwed, but that&#x27;s really not Facebook&#x27;s concern. Their no pseudonym policy makes perfect sense. Whether or not you like it or would use services that enforce it is an entirely separate issue. I feel like I don&#x27;t have to explain this but I will anyway. Using a real name helps them help you find people you know (or at least whose name you know). That&#x27;s the whole point. To start implementing policies conducive to anonymity defeats the entire purpose of Facebook.<p>I understand why Facebook is such a great tool for activists and dissidents and why a social network built especially for those people would not be ideal. That said, at the end of the day Facebook has no obligation to support such people. The fact that it&#x27;s such a great tool for activists is just a side effect of the app&#x27;s main purpose and use by the general population. I&#x27;d even go so far as to say that if they blocked Tor purposely in the future no one would really have any right to be outraged. I mean, you can certainly and understandably be outraged, but you really can&#x27;t say Facebook has wronged you as being a tool for activists isn&#x27;t really their mission. Complaining that Facebook wants to collect info to show you ads is like complaining that the coffee shop requires that you give them money to be served. Tracking is the way you pay to use Facebook and I doubt they&#x27;d ever implement paid accounts to get rid of the tracking and ads.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are some who work at Facebook who feel a moral obligation to support those activities but at the end of the day its a business and it isn&#x27;t a business founded upon principles that fall in line with those of activists. If Mozilla created a social network, maybe then we could say the company has a moral obligation to encourage anonymity where people wanted but that kind of philosophy is just not in Facebook&#x27;s DNA.<p><pre><code>     if you must conduct sensitive work, why do it on Facebook, a network that is committed to sharing things in public?\n</code></pre>\nBecause of exactly that. It&#x27;s public and the general population uses it for an entirely different reason. If you&#x27;re doing sensitive work and need to get the message out then Facebook is a great tool for the job so long as you can remain anonymous. I know that&#x27;s totally contradictory sounding but it&#x27;s reasonably possible. Currently you <i>can</i> use Tor and other measures (assuming this issue is resolved) like using a fake name (which is technically a pseudonym but what I really mean is a name meant to look like a real person but isn&#x27;t). Everyone uses it, you can let the world know important info, and though you can be rooted out, it makes it more difficult as you&#x27;re a needle in a haystack. Compare this to a tool built specifically for activist communication - it&#x27;s basically a big honeypot for unfriendly governments. They know that <i>every</i> user is a political dissident and now they really don&#x27;t have to narrow down their search. They can just start hacking and tracking every user on the site.",1371579066

I take that be be a big sign that living on liquid feed is sub-optimal and needs to be done cautiously.  Other people say it&#x27;s a sign of an industry that can be disrupted.<p>My posts in this thread are trying quite hard to be constructive.  I admit I find it difficult because I have strongly negative opinions about some of the Soylent product.",1371578766

I can&#x27;t rate the quality of a blind inbound from someone I don&#x27;t know (which is almost certainly from one of their paying customers.) And I can&#x27;t see how others have rated that individual&#x27;s communications in the past. So there&#x27;s really little incentive for recruiters to be more judicious, and that&#x27;s going to hurt LinkedIn eventually.

5900916,comment,5898305,5900629,4,0,rayiner,,,"I think most people would call the FISC an Article III court just based on the fact that historically the focus of &quot;Article III-ness&quot; has been on the independence of the judges, as a result of the Article III guarantees of lifetime tenure and non-diminishment of pay during service. At least one court of appeals has rejected the argument that the FISC judges are not article III judges because they serve limited appointments, because they are nonetheless U.S. district judges: <a href=""https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/807/807.F2d.787.85-5133.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/807/807.F2d.787.85...</a>.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think Glidden v. Zdanok unarguably supports the idea that FISC is an Article III court (though Kerr doesn&#x27;t claim it does), just because it is composed of article III judges. Glidden is actually about the opposite question: whether the judges were article III judges based on whether the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals were article III courts. And most of the analysis of Glidden focuses on things like the courts&#x27; ability to hear justiciable cases and controversies and to exercise the Article III judicial power. Under these criteria, you cannot call the FISC an Article III court because it can&#x27;t even hear any cases and controversies, nor can it exercise the essence of article III judicial power (the power to render binding, final judgments with regards to matters affecting life, liberty, and property).<p>So I would personally call the FISC an Article I court staffed by Article III judges sitting by designation. But I worry it would be an idiosyncratic use of the term. In any case, whatever you call it, it is clearly not empowered to exercise even a substantial amount of the Article III power, which is the substance of my point. It can&#x27;t put you in jail or take your property.",1371578649

What is written in the article:<p><i>This past Sunday HP researcher Vinay Deolalikar became the second person at HP to fall victim to the Internet fameball machine, as he posted his attempt to prove P ≠ NP on his personal website, and sent out an announcement email, which got picked up by the original formulator of the problem, Stephen Cook. Cook forwarded Deolalikar’s email to select mathematician colleagues with the now infamous statement “This appears to be a relatively serious claim to have solved P vs NP.”</i><p>Those who have been following this on HN know the real sequence of events:<p>1. Deolalikar emailed his paper to a select few theorists so that they could review it. In other words, he was soliciting peer-review.<p>2. Someone leaked the paper. It made it up to scribd first, as far as I know. Eventually pdfs were in the wild.<p>3. HN and others caught on to the developing story.<p>4. Presumably since the cat was out of the bag, Deolalikar posted the announcement on his webpage along with a pdf of the paper.<p>With these facts in mind, the lede is, well, misleading. As written:<p><i>What happens when Twitter and online communities filter scientific discovery ahead of professionals?</i><p>That's clearly not what happened, since the paper was first sent to the people who are most qualified to evaluate it. Further, the next sentence,<p><i>As we saw this week, a lot of fuss over a result that will ultimately be discarded into the dustbin of flawed mathematical proofs.</i><p>That remains to be seen.<p>(This is a long way of saying what RiderOfGiraffes said.)",1281650287

Local number portability is the system that allows people to keep their phone number and change their carrier. Wire line local number portability happened first and then wireless number portability went live in November 2003. I had been working in this area for about six years.<p>About a week before the system went live. I'm on site and in a meeting. We were covering all the test results and launch plan details. I get a call from my wife. I figured it was important because she knew I was on-site. I take the call. she says, ""Guess what I just heard. You are going to be able to change cell phone companies and keep your number! Isn't that cool?"" ""Um, Hun what do you think I've been working on for the last six years?""",1281650119

The problem is obvious to me: These people are book lovers. That is, they love the books themselves more than the information in them. This leads to criticism like ""oh, but you can't get that feel and smell you get when you open a book"" or ""you can't show off your intellectual awesomeness to your mates-to be"" as opposed to constructive criticism like ""note-taking on e-readers is still much more cumbersome than normal books"".

1599346,comment,1598649,1598806,0,0,rossedwards,,,"The problem is that there really isnt any definition of languages within the java landscape right now.  Meaning theres a bunch of languages but noen really stand out for any specifc uses with the expection of people that know them well and are using them well.  So its very confusing to know which to use.<p>For example Grails and groovy were supposed to be big on the java framework but due to seveeral reasons they seem to be really more niche.  PArtly because it seems the people behind both of them just arent dealing wiht the problems such as bugs quickly enough.<p>Scala is an interesting language but again there doesnt seem to be a heavy push for it.  Expect for peopel that are using it and know what its strengths are.<p>All of which leads to alot of confusion about which technology to use.<p>Then theres the issue of frameworks.  Theres a million of them but none of them really stand out.  ANd personally i dont think it helps that oracle is no running things.<p>On the other hand ruby is known by many people as being pretty powerful and used by alot of startups.  Same thing with php.

I always appreciate any effort to elucidate complicating matters--especially those on matters I happen to have a vested interest in--but seeing as this is A Really Challenging Engineering Problem That Lot's Of People Like Myself Spend The Better Part Of Our Careers Trying To Solve and it's being offered up in a pithy, bite-size, 1000-word blog post on ""Designing Web Applications for Scalability"", well, I'm going to have to get out my red pen.<p>The entire subsection on ""Choosing your data storage setup"" is <i>completely</i> inconsistent precisely because it attempts to tackle such a huge problem in the space of a few paragraphs. Couch and Redis don't even partition out of the box, Tokyo Cabinet only does so with the help of Lightcloud, Mongo's auto-sharding is still unready for production, and Cassandra and Voldemort are fully distributed clusters for whom replication and partitioning mean very different things (and, incidentally, using ""partitioning"" and ""sharding"" interchangeably is one thing; doing the same for ""shard"" and ""node"" is very different).<p>And of course by muddying the waters with respect to the datastores themselves the entire treatment of designing a schema is similarly inconsistent. How can you have a universal keying strategy when you don't even know the terms of your discussion? Are you hashing to shards or to a ring? On the client side? With Zookeeper? Or with a messaging service?<p>Anyway, I wholeheartedly agree with the author's spirit of building for customer acquisition while also building for scalability, but I guess my advice would be ""do plenty of homework and never expect to learn everything you'll need to know after reading a hundred blog posts--much less after reading just one.""",1281648995

I didn't feel all bubbly inside when he was born, and I kinda felt bad because I thought that I might be horrible for not feeling all 'father-y'. I am not sure if this is something that happens to everybody, but it did to me.<p>The first three months were tough. Physically and mentally. Your wife is going through some more serious body changes (i.e. healing from bringing another human into the world), and the human you guys brought in is reliant on you for - literally - everything.<p>It can be psychologically draining and physically taxing. You get little sleep, no matter how much you try to sleep while the baby sleeps.<p>However, just remember that the first few months are the roughest....it usually gets better from there on.<p>My son is now 2.5 years old and I can't believe where the time has gone.<p>I ask him to say 'hippopotamus' and he says 'ip-oh-pon-oh-mus'. Just for that little moment alone, everything I have been through for the last 2.5 years, all the medical bills, all the midnight rushing to the ER, all diaper changes, everything is worth it.<p>Typically, once the baby starts responding to you, guys tend to prefer that stage. It is SOOO worth it...so just hang in there, and like ezmobius said - do what your wife wants (although you will be exhausted as hell you never went through what she went through, so no bitching) and do it with a smile. She will appreciate it. If she appreciates it, you will too :)<p>P.S. I have since deactivated my data plan on my bb, because when I was with my son, I realized I wasn't really 'with him'. I was always checking my mail or responding to bbm. It's good to be away from the computer when you are away from the computer.<p>P.P.S Oh...my wife is about to give birth to our second (a girl this time), so I was writing this as much for myself as it was for you.

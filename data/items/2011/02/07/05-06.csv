Of course Google Reader works (along with every other web-based RSS reader), but is it pleasant to use? Absolutely not. I'm not implying that the RSS reader concept sucks. I'm saying every implementation I've seen sucks. As a concept, an RSS reader is an amazingly useful application. You can get all of your updates without navigating through cyber-space and having to remember to check your favorite blogs regularly. RSS readers throw it all in your face, and this is good.<p>Thinking of it from a programmer's perspective, this is not better than any other RSS reader. You have to think of it from a user prescriptive. There's a reason iPads are so popular. From a technological standpoint, does it make sense to shell out $600+ on a dumbed down computer with minimal functionality? No way jose. But it's all about convenience and usability - they're enjoyable to use, and this is exactly what a web-app like this would offer (for people who prefer web browsers over tablets).",1297058111

If I were to write a paper on it, my thesis would be that the question of ""which one is the fork"" is the result of a bug in the layer of semantics, and so what actually happens is determined by the lower layers of abstraction: code, law, and psychology.",1297056310

If there's some booming technology which offers returns of 12% (because it's just that awesome) per year, but my factory only offers 3%, why would the banker lend me money at <3% when he could make his loan to someone in the tech field and get <12%?<p>Similarly, if I'm hopping on a rocket to go mine on Alpha Centauri and time dilation cuts my years in half to just 5 years of work, then why would the banker give me money when he could give it to someone who will stay home and get 10 years of work done? I might be the better deal, but if so, I had better return with some awfully expensive rocks 10 years later.<p>Of course, this implies that investing and then going on a relativistic cruise is a good idea. But why not? That capital you are investing came from somewhere. Where did it come from? It came from someone working hard and then <i>not</i> consuming. Someone(s) chose to work hard and generate $1 million of value, say, but then chose not to go out and hold an orgy of buying $1 million of chocolate and flatscreen TVs. That $1 million of value remains and presumably circulates and supports further investment and growth, which themselves will compound and compound. When that investor returns centuries later, he deserves whatever is left of his investments.<p>(Given the past few centuries, I wouldn't place high odds on his investment growing to Bill Gates sizes, or there being anything left at all.

Your link is not really informative - he does not like it, but we don't know why. I am not surprised it has WTF for something like nodejs (which let's be honest, has rather simplistic needs for a build tool compared to samba or chromium). Waf is far from perfect for sure.<p>I have experience with quite a few build tools, from autoconf/make to waf, with custom ones, and waf is by far the one with the least WTF so far if you want to do something which is hard. It gives you the power of a real language, which is needed for complex builds IMHO. It looks like node.js is now using cmake, and its macro language is quite weak and error prone IMO, although it definitely works for non trivial projects. Waf is also fast, small enough that you can hack it if wanted (compared to cmake with C++ + architecture based on autogenerated makefiles...), and just enough usage by non-trivial projects I would expect for a tool I may depend on (samba and ardour are two quite big, multi-year, > 100 kloc of cross-platform, multi-language tools).",1297055255

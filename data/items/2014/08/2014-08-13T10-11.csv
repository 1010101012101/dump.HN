The traditional freely movable windows are usually not using the desktop space very efficiently unless you spend a lot of time positioning them or use some third party utilities and configure them properly. I have a feeling that especially &quot;normal users&quot; very seldom use for example two windows side-by-side - even though this might be good for productivity.<p>The modern UI style was more like a tiling window manager. 8.1 made it possible to split the screen vertically among n applications. It would have been nice to see them explore this further to allow other kind of configurations as well.<p>The main problem with modern UI from my perspective was the lack of application. There was only few modern UI apps available and most of them pretty useless, tiny utilities. Now Office (even Outlook), no Visual Studio etc. A &quot;simple&quot; fix would have been to allow users to run the old applications the same way as modern UI apps.",1407927125

Another is possession of the ability and skill to use the weapon appropriately. This is why, for example, young children cannot carry weapons in public. And in that respect its very hard to make a case for blind people being able to carry lethal weapons in public places, or indeed on private property.

He can claim all the liberal credentials he wants, but it&#x27;s difficult not to read this as a minor tantrum... Even assuming his claim to superior qualifications (and that&#x27;s quite the claim to make without access to another individuals resume and academic results, etc) this whole article reads like the misdirected frustrations of a wounded ego.<p>For one thing it&#x27;s a dumbass approach to human resources to favour only those candidates who possess superior qualifications, and its one that I&#x27;m pretty sure has generally lost its currency. Any enterprise with a vacancy is not only looking for a puzzle piece who&#x27;s competent to perform the designated tasks of a role, but someone who fits in the culture of the company, and there are always candidates who&#x27;s work history and experience shines for reasons besides formal qualifications.<p>I just find this whole article objectionable. That a company has made a public commitment to diversity doesn&#x27;t mean that the author and his friend failed to be interviewed because of their penises. Clearly they both have high opinions of themselves, but claiming discrimination just because a woman got the job and some vague notion that the hiring company &quot;endorsed&quot; a youtube video (really what?), well it smacks of pettiness and a complete ignorance of the thinking that goes into hiring decisions.<p>No matter the heights of the authors disbelief or his wounded pride in not even being interviewed, hiring the right person can be a dark art and just because it escapes this writers comprehension that a particular woman was favoured over him, is no kind of argument that discrimination was at play.<p>Besides, it was probably nepotism.",1407924486

Operating a vehicle is pretty expensive, and you probably need at least €20 per hour for the driver (remember, the cost of paying someone wages of X is often 1-5 or 2 times X). Then there&#x27;s insurance, fuel, tax, registration, and fees. Also, cabs aren&#x27;t always carrying passengers, so it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re actually going to get €60 for 60 minutes of driving. On top of all that, even, the fares are not adjusted much for periods of low or high demand, so a cab will cost very roughly the same at 8:30 AM Saturday morning as 5:30 PM Friday evening.<p>Really, I&#x27;d say €10 for 10 minutes is a pretty fair deal.

So, implicit learning is a scientific term, that should be contrasted with semantic or declarative learning rather than &quot;explicit&quot; or &quot;~~intentional~~&quot; learning. Implicit learning trains implicit or procedural memory, whereas semantic learning trains semantic memory.<p>Semantic memory is your memory of places, things, facts, etc.. Procedural, or implicit, memory is of things like &quot;how to ride a bike&quot; or &quot;how to identify a chess tactic&quot;. Your implicit memory, and your ability to implicitly learn, is related to all sorts of things, like creativity, fluid intelligence, intuition, all of your background processes.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how you can operationally define something as nebulous as &quot;mindfulness&quot; (I&#x27;ve seen a reference to the metric they use in another comment, so apparently operationalizations do exist), but if it does reduce implicit learning, it is indeed bad.<p>Virtually all learning should eventually end up being implicit. Implicit learning is venerable hacker feeling out a bug in some code and massaging in a solution. Implicit learning is what makes it possible for chess grandmasters to instantly identify board configurations and memorize arbitrary board layouts instantly -- as long as the layout is legal. Experts can do these things because they have automatized their disciplines, because over time their repeated, implicit practice has caused their pattern-matching brains to encode vast amounts of information over years of lessons.",1407924071

3678884,comment,3678492,3678492,10,0,moultano,,,"Publishers are right to fear Amazon, but a much better solution for mitigating it seems obvious to me: Sell DRM-free books. Amazon is getting an unassailable lockin on avid readers because they can never again use a device that amazon doesn't approve. If the books are DRM-free, then the distributor is the one who gets commoditized, rather than the publisher.<p>That said, I'm not entirely confident that DRM is as unnecessary for books as it is for music. Starting to read a book is much more of an investment, and also much more likely to be based on a recommendation from a friend who certainly has the book (and there's a long social history of legal lending.) So I guess it comes down to which they are more scared of, being disintermediated by Amazon, or disintermediated by their customers.",1331189995

3678846,comment,3676847,3676847,1,0,b0o,,,"Main flaws from his conclusion:
1. ""Don't filter reviews. If the site is supposed to be ""Yelper"" driven and democratic, so be it. Post them all!"" The reviews are for Fior D'italia ARE posted, a handful are removed (10 out of 218+115 filtered reviews). The other 300 reviews are still there, which should be more than sufficient for someone to decide if they want to eat at that place. Of the 115 filtered reviews, ~50 of them were 4-5 star reviews made by reviewers with less than 3 reviews, it seems logical to filter those out.<p>2. ""Allow businesses to opt out"". Yelp shouldn't let them. It's the internet. There is some truth in this, but yelp exists to filter out the good and bad restaurants. I can see some lawsuits coming out of this.<p>3. ""Give businesses a chance to post comments or respond at the top of their Yelp page where the public can read it before going to the reviews"". If yelp were to do that, then businesses could just stall the bad reviews and only keep the good ones, rendering the review system useless.<p>4. ""Post the filtered reviews where they are easy to find and review. Many customers of ours have had their reviews of the Fior filtered out, and they are livid."" Filtered reviews are at the bottom, and they are pretty easy to find. As I said, the filtered reviews, have reasoning to be filtered in the first place.<p>5. Continued from above: ""They don't understand why this is done, nor do we"". I understand why those reviews were filtered perfectly. Of the 115 reviews, ~50 were 5 or 4 star reviews made by reviewers with less than 3 reviews, I can see why they would be filtered because they're probably bots.<p>Yelp's system is decent. If you only take the 23 Elite members' reviews, they give this place an average rating of ~3-stars, which is a bit better than the overall review. But the owner should really read his reviews, especially the 1-star reviews.<p>If for some reason, the guy who wrote this article reads this:
1. Read your 1-star reviews, half of them are saying your food is too salty. The other half is saying your service sucks ass, either because your waiters take too long, bad vouchers(?), bad pricing and bad environment. Price, I get for a $$$ restaurant people should be prepared to fork ~$100 for the meal, but I guess the quality wasn't worth the price.
If this guy wanted to take an objective opinion of a yelp review, why not take Ike's place's yelp review with 4,128 reviews.
2. Instead of complaining about it online, why don't you just ask your customers to write reviews. Provide them a link to your yelp review, ask them to review for 10% off or something, put computers with internet browsers with your yelp page as the home page. Make them scream how good or bad your place is.<p>If I'm ever in the area, I might check this place out, if my wallet can handle it.<p>But yeah, I've been seeing increasing reviews on how yelp is putting down positive reviews because they don't advertise with them.",1331189125

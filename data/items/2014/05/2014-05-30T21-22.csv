Like this one <a href=""http://apps.evozi.com/apk-downloader/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apps.evozi.com/apk-downloader/</a> Although I don&#x27;t know how trustworthy they are.<p>If you want to avoid Google, you should install a build without Google services.<p>EDIT: OP&#x27;s server went down so here&#x27;s a copy of the rant:<p>I&#x27;ve just lost it with Google.<p>I install the latest Cyanogen Mod. What I&#x27;ve found is basically no android apps let you download the package to install yourself - you HAVE to use the App Store - and that means you HAVE to have a Google account.<p>So I make a fake account and download the apps I need. I&#x27;m not sure if I might want some more, so I&#x27;ve not logged out.<p>I went down to a museum today, took some photos.<p>What I&#x27;ve just found is they have all been fucking uploaded without my fucking permission to the fucking Google cloud. Including a set of private photos, one of which was sent to me on the understanding it was for no one else to see. Way to fucking go, Google. I CANNOT TRUST YOU.<p>So much for privacy. So much for ASKING PERMISSION. So much for MAKING IT CLEAR and so much for keeping my identity private - my IP and my phone are now associated with these photos, which contain my location info and probably shots of me in reflection. (I later found out - also my personal archived photos were uploaded - of my friends, me, personal photos for my eyes only).<p>Uploading to Google is irrevocable. You can delete all you want - Google will be keeping everything. Delete just means <i>you no longer see it</i>.<p>Oh, one other thing. If I&#x27;m logged into Google and I go to add someone to my address book, I can ONLY do so if I accept it being copied into the Google cloud - which is why my address book is currently still empty.<p>Fuck you Google, fuck you. Gone too far.<p>I hate this so much. I&#x27;m now wasting my fucking time trying to find out WHAT Google has done so I can try to undo it. I&#x27;m now searching on-line to try to find out how the fuck to delete a Google account.<p>Addendum. Yup. Logging into a Google account SILENTLY activates FULL UPLOAD OF EVERYTHING ON YOUR PHONE TO GOOGLE. Contacts, photos, emails, everything. EVERYTHING.<p>I think it&#x27;s fair to say I cannot express in words how much I hate Google.<p>So, now, the only way I can see to at least superficially remove my photos from Google is to make copies to my PC, then delete them on my phone, with sync enabled, so they&#x27;re removed from public visibility by Google.<p>All this trouble, frustrating, anger, annoyance, from Google, to me.<p>I am never going to log in to Google again.",1401487130

By using a different DNS server your ISP DNS server has no logs to show for your DNS activity.<p>It is good privacy practice to split the data about your internet activities across different providers to make it more difficult to track you. For example if you use google services for web search, then you should not use google for your email (ideally your should host your own email).<p>But the sad state of reality is that ISP DNS are often poor, whether it is hijacking DNS for profit or blocking domains following judge&#x27;s orders or local laws.",1401487127

When they can&#x27;t determine if an infection is viral or bacterial, they treat it on the chance that it&#x27;s bacterial (since we have a known treatment for bacterial infections and don&#x27;t usually have a treatment for viral infections).<p>Tonsillitis is a good example: About 50% of tonsillitis cases are viral and 50% bacterial. &quot;Relying on clinical presentation and history alone is unreliable in differentiating streptococcal from viral tonsillitis.&quot;[1] And bacterial tonsillitis can be quite serious.<p>So it seems reasonable to go ahead and treat with antibiotics even when there&#x27;s a 50% chance that it&#x27;s wasted, because the other 50% chance was that the treatment was highly beneficial.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=2024"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=2024</a>",1401486820

7824295,comment,7823385,7824245,22,0,jacquesm,,,"The biggest enemy of pigments is ultra-violet and lots of cheap flash kits do not filter that out.<p>Sunlight is about 1 KW/square meter on a non-cloudy day at noon, directly from above.<p>4% of that is a typical value for the UV component.<p>So the UV power hitting a 1 square meter surface at noon is about 40 Watts.<p>Photographic flash is on the order of a millisecond give or take, and power output of a typical flash during that millisecond is 100 Ws, or 100 KW/ms. Depending on how far away you are from the work of art you&#x27;re putting for every 10 flashes then the equivalent of about of a second of exposure to the sun on the totality of the work (much more than 1 square meter, so you have to divide by the total surface). In the case of the chapel all the light discharged in the chapel will hit the object somewhere so apart from atmospheric effects (likely small) you can assume all of that light would contribute to the fading.<p>So every 10,000 tourists passing through and making one picture each with flash on is the equivalent of about 1000 second&#x27;s worth of exposure to direct sunlight (think of a window of one square meter opening for 1000 seconds once per day), all this assuming that the flash contains an equivalent amount of UV as sunlight which likely is not the case. About 20,000 tourists per day pass through during the peak of the season, so on such days that&#x27;s the equivalent of 2000 such seconds of the open window.<p>So at a guess, this is probably not too much of a problem, unless the pigments used break down very easily. (Blue is usually the most stable, with other pigments being more susceptible to fading)<p>What would be a problem is the fact that if all these people are discharging their flashes all the time that this seriously interferes with the ability of others who do not engage in such annoying reproductive behaviour to appreciate what they are looking at.<p>edit: fixed some of the math",1401486805

Not locked away in a MySQL database that can&#x27;t be easily versioned with Git.<p>* Versioning: plain text lends itself really well to versioning. Diffs are meaningful. It&#x27;s easy and light-weight, and pragmatic to version a bunch of simple markdown files.<p>* Finally: fine-tuned output control. This is what Liquid lets you accomplish.

You can move the conflict handling totally to the client side, but the conflict handling must be implemented somewhere.

I&#x27;d pay around $150/mo for such service, and I&#x27;m not one of those guys that runs stuff maxed out 24x7.<p>There just are no options where I live for that amount of bandwidth other than Comcast.  So instead I have my primary comcast line ($120/mo) which is 150/20, and a backup DSL line from USWest/Qwest/Centurylink/whatever they are calling themselves today.  I believe that one is 20/2, but it sucks so bad (seriously no 1500 MTU still? sigh.) I rarely use it even for failover anymore.  LTE is faster.",1401483792

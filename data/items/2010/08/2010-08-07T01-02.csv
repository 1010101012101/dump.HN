(If I can get out of dealing with it and cede the work to the compiler, all the better...)<p>And the caching locality discussions are the same ones that arise with virtual memory out in main memory; if you bounce around all over the place in address space (eg: setting up the wrong stride on an array, or partitioning your data differently from your access), you'll incur page faults.<p>And if you get particularly good with your packing of your data, you can sometimes trigger word tearing when you're accessing adjacent data within the same granule from different processes or different threads.<p>Caches and cache designs, too, are individually funky.  There are processors which got faster by going to smaller and fewer caches and better (lower) latency.  So if you fell out of cache in the new design, you'd assume you'd do worse, but with lower latency on the box out to memory, you actually did better pulling from main memory than if you were pulling from second-level on the previous generation.",1281146228

However, I feel that there's a contradiction. You say that it is easier to understand but have learned to write them in plain old ""if"" first because it's better. It's easier to get it wrong if you write it shorthand.
If it's better to start writing them in ""if"", doesn't that mean it's easier to understand? If it is easier to use guards, defaults, and ternaries, you shouldn't have to resort to plain ""if"" to get the logic right.

1582843,comment,1582226,1582317,0,0,flatulent1,,,"Actually, a 5% return looks BETTER not worse, when there's deflation - you're getting the return, plus the base value of the investment  which later can buy MORE.  In your example the investment would allow buying 10% more later, the mattress-money only 5%.  Actually getting that 5% will likely be more difficult though.
When there's inflation, you're return has to match the inflation rate for you to effectively break even in buying power terms and that's not counting being hit by taxes on the gain that wouldn't buy more.<p>The real danger of deflation comes when people stop spending thinking it is better to buy later because things will get cheaper.  Along with problems getting funds, that's the killer with home buying.  If people think there's continued deflation in housing, they'll try to hold off buying.  Of course behavior has to be adjusted for other factors too.<p>Deflation from things like falling oil prices is good.  Many consumers will buy more of other products if their energy costs fall.  It would help others pay down debt.  That's good, we don't want them to default. Of course those in the oil industry want things to fall just enough to kill/delay alternatives or improvements in efficiency. It's good if we reduce the percentage of our spending on imports if those prices fall, but bad if exchange rate shifts reduce demand for our exports.  Deflation won't be flat across the board by wages, products, or region so analysis is very complex.<p>Income is another issue.  Considering that most worked-for incomes haven't kept pace with inflation for some time now, our value to the workforce has deflated.<p>Deflation is bad in the sense of allowing those out of the country holding dollars to buy up more assets like real estate.  We want people abroad buying our products and services, not our land.  Not owning our land effectively makes us slaves.",1281144043

I have one for real friends, one for people I have to accept but I don't want them to see anything about me and those who aren't on any of those lists are on the default one: they can't see most things but they can see more than those who are almost blocked.",1281143265
1582824,comment,1581156,1581156,0,0,myffical,,,"World of Goo, another excellent indie game, also reported a 90% piracy rate two years ago. The developers calculated that percentage from the number of users on their high score board, which were much more than the number of actual online sales. They were very gracious about it, deliberately choosing not to put any DRM on their software.<p>Sad as it may be, putting DRM might not increase sales numbers significantly. It just makes crackers more determined. Such was World of Goo's reasoning against DRM.<p><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2008/11/acrying-shame-world-of-goo-piracy-rate-near-90.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2008/11/acrying-shame-wor...</a>",1281143243

You can accept someone and add that person to a list which will make that person unable to see anything if you want to while still being ""friends"". Oh, you can also just forget about accepting friendships you don't want to have, the person asking for it will know you still didn't accept him but that's about it.<p>Emails: You can disable all email notifications (or toggle most of them off leaving the most important on, it's really well done) going to ""My Account"", ""Notifications"" tab.<p>Tagging: You can make your default friends' settings restrict things like seeing photos. If you want some of them to see those photos you can add them to a list where you let them see photos.<p>Vender Lock-In: I'm not sure about this but didn't Open Social just solve this problem?",1281143109

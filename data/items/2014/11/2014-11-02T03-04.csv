I don&#x27;t just want to deliver the sales pitch, but I&#x27;m reading about your problems and I know that Mylio was designed to help address them.<p>To address the speed issue, Mylio converts 20+ MB raw images into 1 MB, 2048 px previews that are faster to load and can be automatically loaded on mobile devices or laptops with smaller hdds. Caveat, we use a proprietary compression technology to convert raw images into previews, so not all cameras are supported, but we are increasing camera support all the time.<p>A lot of the users of Mylio have terrabytes of photos, and Mylio will automatically provide you with different views of your photos (time, location, people, and customized albums) as well as metadata and rating based searches across your entire library of photos, on desktops or mobile devices.<p>Bonus features, Mylio will help you sync you automatically sync photos between your phone/table/desktop and external hard drives/nas all without going through the cloud.",1414900681

However, I do have doubts.  Outside of being worried about the big brands removing your access to your hard earned reputations (which seems unlikely on a mass scale), what would be the other common uses cases for a crypto identity key?  As we know, in order for a majority of people to adopt new technologies, there has to be a very compelling use case.  I am not sure a consolidated identity key solves any real problem or rather it is just a cool tech thing that us hackers would like to see, kind of similar to the problem that bitcoin in general is having in achieving adoption.<p>I am curious if you guys have any really good thoughts on products that could implement a crypto identity key that solves a real life problem.

But the tasks we&#x27;re trying to give to ANNs are generally about seeing some dataset the same way we do. The whole point in training ANNs on data images with human created class labels is to teach them / encode in them a representation of the mental concepts that we apply to the world, which is supposed to be generalizable. We evaluate them by testing their outputs on new inputs for which we have a human-provided label. You say that &quot;similar&quot; is relative to some observer -- but if the trained ANNs differ wildly from humans in judging what is similar, then maybe they&#x27;re not doing the job as well as we hoped.",1414900163

What is the neural network actually detecting, that you can change what it is detecting with such innocuous-to-human-eyes changes?  Is there indeed some kind of pattern that is genuinely characteristic of camels or whatever that is invisible to us, but &quot;visible&quot; to the neural net?<p>The temptation is to say it&#x27;s just overtraining, picking up some noise that happens to be the same in various training set photos but is genuinely meaningless in the real world.  But the fact that multiple different algorithms have the same or similar adversarial examples, and the fact that deep learning neural networks do appear to perform reasonably well in the real world, argues against that.<p>So if we provisionally think that it&#x27;s not overtraining, what is it?  Could there be a feature of camels that we can&#x27;t see?  Could that tell us something about camels, or vision, or something?<p>And vice-versa, what if our goal isn&#x27;t a narrow task like &quot;identify the existence of camels,&quot; but instead we&#x27;re trying to get a computer to identify similar features in camels as we are (perhaps because the goal is not simply to identify camels, but to identify camels and then reason about the camel in some way).  How do we get a deep learning neural net to not focus on some invisible feature, and instead learn to identify a camel based on features that humans DO perceive?",1414899958

8545508,comment,8545206,8545206,0,0,austenallred,,,"I was diagnosed with ADHD at a very young age, and have been doing battle with my attention span for most of my life. I had only read a half dozen books all the way through when I graduated from High School, despite reading at a college reading level before I was out of elementary school and having started hundreds of them. The few books that I had read included Les Miserables and War and Peace, both of which I binge-read over a period of a few days, barely allowing myself to eat and rarely allowing myself to shower while I read them. The other ones were Frindle, Tangerine, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time, and Catcher in the Rye. They were completely consuming. My addiction to video games was so intense and so severe that they were outright banned at my house. I was terrible at school, skipping more than half of my classes, but tested in the 99th percentile for standardized testing, learning a lot of what I should have learned in school by deduction as I was taking the test. That allowed me to get into college, which I later dropped out of, electing instead to buy a one-way ticket to China unsure if I would ever come back. Basically I was either 0% engaged in something or 110%, and if I wasn&#x27;t engaged it felt like no matter how hard I fought I couldn&#x27;t force myself to care.<p>The turning point came when I was living in eastern Ukraine serving a Mormon mission. As per the mission rules, the only books we read were scriptural, we only used a computer for 30 minutes a week to email home, and in my particular mission I spent 90% of my time, every minute from 11 AM to 9 PM (except for a one-hour dinner) walking around, talking to people in the streets.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it was age or that I was finally rid of the many stimulants I used to have, but my mind just slowed down. I concentrated on <i>everything</i>, and, perhaps especially because I was speaking Russian, I could literally recall every word of every conversation I had. I sat down in the mornings and studied the intricacies of the Russian language for an hour straight without blinking an eye. I read the Old Testament cover to cover; something that would have made me literally pull my hair out just a year earlier.<p>Then I went home. I got an iPhone, I got on the Internet, and it all came back. I try to limit the stimulants, (I&#x27;ve become very minimalistic), and I usually spend a lot of the morning with a calmer mind, but... I work online. I love the Internet. And I haven&#x27;t yet been able to calm my mind like it was for those two years.<p>It may be a matter of self-control - it probably is, but learning to program is incredibly painful. 10 minutes at a time sometimes with an incredible number of stops and starts.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the answer is, nor do I pretend that I can project my experience onto some greater understanding of what ADHD is, how to defeat it, or if it needs defeating, but the experience of feeling like I could finally do all the things I wanted to do because I didn&#x27;t have anything else to stimulate me was fascinating, and it may be valuable to someone else.",1414898799

The Atlas of Economic Complexity is our current online tool that lets you interactively visualize a countryâs trade and explore growth opportunities for more than a hundred countries worldwide. There are also other National Atlas projects in the pipeline, one for Colombia and one for Mexico.
The idea is that countries provide us with their data and the Center provides them with economic policy advice based on our economic theories, and an interactive tool to explore their situation and make sound policy decisions at the regional level. If you&#x27;re looking for a high-impact job, this is it!<p>================================<p>* What we want to do:<p>We want to focus on building features around this idea of storytelling with data (see example at the end), as well as re-do our UI and design to be cleaner and up to modern standards, and to add better visualization capabilities. We look at NYtimes / WaPo data driven articles with envy. We salivate when we see Tufte&#x27;s work.
We need you, dear frontend engineer, to make all that a reality!<p>We use d3.js for the visualizations. We know that at least the visualization part would be ideally suited for a single page app, and we&#x27;d love to implement something along those lines with Angular / Backbone / etc. We want to rethink our designs and how the frontend works in general.<p>Especially with the new national projects with Colombia and Mexico, you&#x27;ll have free rein over the creative process and the technological aspects of your work.<p>==================================<p>* Our stack:<p>We use python, django, mysql (hopefully postgres soon), elasticsearch, ansible for the back end. For the frontend, it&#x27;s jquery / d3 for now. Everything we do is open source: <a href=""https://github.com/cid-harvard"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cid-harvard</a> and we use Github for bug/feature tracking.<p>==================================<p>* Work environment / goals:
Coming from the startup world, the work environment is pretty laid back, but everyone is expected to hold their own and get their work done without being micromanaged. No late nights and weekends, although I&#x27;ve been known to do that once in a blue moon because I felt like it.<p>We&#x27;re a small engineering team (me and a data viz researcher, plus a new super talented designer), but we work with a large group of brilliant doctoral / postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds like econ, public policy, physics, international development. I&#x27;ve been here only for a few months, but I&#x27;ve been given responsibility to fully overhaul and clean up the backend, which speaks towards the kind of autonomy you&#x27;ll have.<p>I&#x27;m looking to build out our burgeoning team into a small but strong group that specializes in turning ideas into reality. We have great plans and dreams for the future of this site, and we need people to help. We&#x27;d love to hear more about you and see work samples if possible!

I think everyone acts in their own self interest, and trying to gussy it up as a conspiracy is pretty counter-productive.<p>If you take any kind of historical perspective, then the ability of the rich and powerful to control the proletariat or bend the world to their will is at an all time low.

Nobody would call albuterol inhalers overprescribed or asthma overdiagnosed either. My allergist always has to tell me not to work my life around my triggers past a certain point too. Yet I hear it all the time about the Adderall and Vyvanse I used to take, and about ADHD. All. the. time.<p>I have pretty bad ADHD too. My parents didn&#x27;t want to put me on any meds, so I learned all the coping mechanisms the hard and expensive way _and_ feel that I lost out on a lot of opportunities when I was younger as a result. It&#x27;s the only childhood issue I still hold a grudge over. When I could finally do whatever I wanted, I felt like a huge burden was lifted with meds because I never stopped struggling with said coping mechanisms anyway. Including stuff like &quot;take a shower&quot; and &quot;eat lunch&quot; on my daily-todo HabitRPG checklist.<p>Unfortunately I&#x27;m trying to get pregnant and had to get off almost everything, so now I&#x27;m back to digging myself into a hole, getting frustrated with even my non-standard and fun life. If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that I have a partner to rely on, I probably would be telling my obgyn to go fuck herself about her judgment call regarding non-stimulant ADHD meds known to be safe. ADHD is a huge negative impact on my life, and I&#x27;d even qualify it as being worse than something potentially life-threatening like asthma >:P<p>Obviously not everyone is the same, and abuse is definitely a problem. That doesn&#x27;t equate to a crutch IMO. Not to mention there&#x27;s a million other problems in the way, one in the US being a lack of accessible and affordable quality health care so people with ADHD can easily get help with non-medication options...",1414897901

But there still are many minorities in the US whose rights are not protected.<p>> Contrast this with anarchism, where the majority can tyrannize over minorities which have no recourse.<p>I think you have it in reverse. In most constitutional democracies, the majorities can legally tyrannize over minorities with the minorities having no recourse at all. Unless your argument is that the US hasn&#x27;t been a constitutional government for most of its history.<p>Anarchy is about eliminating the monopoly of violence that governments use to obtain obedience from minorities.<p>>> Anarchists are opposed to violence; everyone knows that. The main plank of anarchism is the removal of violence from human relations. It is life based on freedom of the individual, without the intervention of the gendarme. For this reason we are the enemies of capitalism which depends on the protection of the gendarme to oblige workers to allow themselves to be exploited--or even to remain idle and go hungry when it is not in the interest of the bosses to exploit them. We are therefore enemies of the State which is the coercive violent organization of society.<p>>> - Errico Malatesta",1414897732

8545455,comment,8544911,8545334,0,0,krick,,,"I thought that more or less all of AI researchers admitted now for a long time that NNs aren&#x27;t human brain and shouldn&#x27;t reasoned about as if they were, because essentially these are different things. They can be used to study some particular behaviour of the intelligence, to make something more clear about how actual brin wokrs, but one must always remember that they are not actual brain. Recent post by LeCun mentioned that as well.<p>Anyway, that would seem natural to me. Consider numbers on the rightmost image in OP-link (I&#x27;ll refer to that blogpost as [0]). Program recognises them &quot;correctly&quot;. Would you? Well, I do recognize some, but not all of them for sure, and I guess it would be easy to make such dataset so I would lose flat to that NN.<p>That makes almost all of [0] pretty much nonsense to me. Author operates common-language words lacking of technical meaning, like &quot;similar&quot;. He point&#x27;s out that two images similar to human are not similar to the algorithm, but if we keep in mind that similarity is property with respect to some observer (ie human, neural net). And that is natural that what is important for that NN is different from what is important for most of us, humans. After all, it often happens that you don&#x27;t recognize something on photo, but your friend does, and as far as you know you are both humans. More than that, after he tells you what it is you are like &quot;Oh, right, I see now! Silly me!&quot; So it&#x27;s kinda common sense that for every two different classifiers you can find two objects that will be classified as similar by one and different by another. Well, yeah, humans have more in common between themselves compared to NNs, no big surprise as well. After all your internal image classifier doesn&#x27;t receive exact pixel values on input, so of course one can find two images so you won&#x27;t even see the difference and that NN fails to describe them as similar.<p>So essentially it is saying only that &quot;every particular NN doesn&#x27;t think like human&quot; which is nothing new. Well, nice catch is that you can easily construct such counter-example manually, but that doesn&#x27;t seem like &quot;the biggest news in neural networks since the invention of the backpropagation algorithm&quot;. More than that, if the first notion (about absense of meaningful features for individual neurons) is completely true, it doesn&#x27;t explain why deep learning is so successful.<p>So, I&#x27;m confused. If it&#x27;s really something &quot;backpropagation-size discovery&quot; I&#x27;m waiting for comment from some expert we all know and trust, who can explain things clearly. You know, Hinton, LeCun. I just don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s <i></i>so<i></i> important about that paper.",1414897323

I guess the email field is only used internally by YC.<p>While I've got you here, I'll just my initial reactions:<p>- 100KB photo limit is waaay too small. Restrict image dimensions, if anything.<p>- Error messages on the side of the page (on the mugshots upload page) are not very visble<p>- What kind of things would I put in the ""tags"" box? Are they comma or space delimited?<p>- ""The person may be from the orient, but they aren't oriented toward the camera."" - This joke is in poor taste...<p>- Connections page is empty?<p>- I don't really know what to do after I've registered...<p>- Problem with links (I see <a href=""http://http://"" rel=""nofollow"">http://http://</a> -- you gotta standardize your inputs!)<p>- I uploaded a photo to search, and am returned all users in the network? This page is confusing!<p>- In order to limit the number of returned users I cropped just my face and uploaded the photo for search. It seems like I was returned everyone but myself!",1193814553

In that case, finding a mate of the opposite sex is not really a problem.  In a herd of cows, or a flock of birds, there will be both males and females.  Animals that don&#x27;t live in groups often have mating calls or attractive scents, or various other ways of attracting a mate.<p>And then there&#x27;s organisms that just do reproduce asexually when necessary, like the snakes in the article.  Or like grass, which only reproduces sexually when it gets long enough to &quot;go to seed&quot; and otherwise just spreads asexually.<p>The question of why sexual reproduction exists at all is a very deep question in evolutionary theory.

Yes, internal, a comparison is typically done via a subtraction; the flags are updated, but not the destination register.  Now, depending upon how you want to interpret the results, as a signed comparison or unsigned comparison, depends on the flags you check (and the conditional jump (or branch) instructions will do this check for you).  The flags that are checked for unsigned comparison are (!f means NOT f, i.e. the flag is not set):<p><pre><code>    above or equal: !C\n    above:          !C and !Z\n    below or equal: C or Z\n    below:          C\n</code></pre>\nAnd the signed comparisons are:<p><pre><code>    above or equal: N == V\n    above:          N == V and !Z\n    below or equal: N != V or Z\n    below:          N != V\n</code></pre>\nAnd, just for completeness, for both signed and unsigned:<p><pre><code>    equal:   Z\n    unequal: !Z</code></pre>",1419587157

A single mistake in the code can lead to a result that appears innocuous enough, but is actually incorrect. \n</code></pre>\nand I am actually sure that is, unfortunatley, very very much a real problem. The reasons I believe so are anecdotal, but so overwhelming I cannot ignore them. I personally prevented already a couple of false results of making it into a paper. And that is just me, in just one research group, in just one university. And that also happened by accident mostly (just staring at a guy&#x27;s screen during a conversation and noticing errors all over the place, redoing an analysis for more subjects and figuring out it is completely wrong, ...). The mistakes I&#x27;ve seen are close to terrifying. Scripts ignoring all input but instead using a generated fixed dataset. Scripts always yielding &#x27;good&#x27; results even if you give them white noise as input. Basically, <i>all</i> typcial programming errors and antipatterns ever invented come together in huge god scripts which produce the results, while in the background Matlab is spitting out one warning after the other, console windows are screaming errors, and all that is just being ignored by the researcher who thinks he/she just mastered the skill of programming. Or knows he/she doesn&#x27;t, but just doesn&#x27;t care. As long as there are good results, you know.<p>Oh yes I&#x27;m getting a bit sentimental now and it&#x27;s not like that <i>everywhere</i> and not <i>every</i> researcher writes code like that. But if even me, with over 10 years of programming experience and all my automated builds and tests and whatnot cannot reliably produce code without one mistake, how on earth are researchers for which the programming part is often just a byproduct, a necessary evil, going to do that?",1419585675

Speaking for myself, it casts doubt onto a site when so many other websites get along fine without relying on it to deliver the content itself and this one doesn&#x27;t. What are they trying to collect about me that&#x27;s so much more important than delivering content.",1419584997

It had a clear Smalltalk pedigree (there was a VisualAge for Smalltalk first, and I think the IDE was written in ST, but I could misremember that point).<p>And a &quot;translation unit&quot; was not a file, like in every other C++ compiler. All translation units were entries in an internal database. And you couldn&#x27;t find the header files with a file manager search.<p>Some people liked it. A lot.

Compare HTTP parsing in nginx with this one and you&#x27;ll notice how much more rigor nginx is about it. Parsing transfer-encoding by itself is costly for example, and nginx does it whether you ask for it or not because it has to populate the structure after all.<p>Just because features are not used doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t have a cost. Features drives you to make design choices that can affect the overall performance otherwise the feature cannot be implemented. Adding more code to your program might trigger a different code layout which can affect memory cache, and branch prediction.<p>It&#x27;s not fair to blindly compare webserver performances without knowing the bottlenecks of each and how the faster webserver overcame those bottlenecks.",1419584690

300331,comment,300312,300312,0,0,jlouis,,,"Reed-Solomon coding is an old fella. Whenever you have a link which is unreliable and you can't afford to retransmit packets on the link when errors are introduced, RS is your friend. Mobile phones are among the prime users of this.<p>If I remember correctly, the PAR/PAR2 formats used on usenet is using RS-encoding as well.<p>An alternative would be to plot the file in N-dimensional space and define a set of vectors to pinpoint it. When you have enough vectors you have the precise pinpoint. Additional vectors gives the error-correction capability. Some microsoft guys played with this idea for Bittorrent-like networks a while back. But there is a disadvantage in the time it takes to decode the data, and it probably doesn't help the swarm that much :/<p>Another interesting viewpoint: We might need RS-encoding on the <i>local</i> harddisks soon (implemented in hardware or software), as it would circument the bit-error rate problem with those disks.",1221051473

If I get super-relaxed, like after a yoga class or a good workout, I can actually see my heartbeat. It's weird, and it was unsettling until I figured out what it was.<p>A close friend of mine has HPPD, and although I can't speak directly from experience on that, it seems to me that much of HPPD is an anxiety reaction to normal visual phenomena that most people grow used to and filter, but for which people can develop hypersensitivity and then become convinced that something is wrong. (This would be much like how, during the onset of a severe panic attack, especially in a person who has never had one before, normal semi-liminal physical sensations morph into ""evidence"" of impending doom/insanity.)",1221051437

I do business with plenty of people that I disagree with. So do you, no doubt.<p>This is a classic (i.e. ""really old"") line of argument against political activists. To testify to that, I give you MIT's most (in?)famous political activist, Noam Chomsky:<p><i>As to how I tolerate MIT, that raises another question. There are people who argue, and I have never understood the logic of this, that a radical ought to distance himself from oppressive institutions. The logic of that argument is that Karl Marx shouldn't have studied in the British Museum which, if anything, was the symbol of the most vicious imperialism in the world... But I think Karl Marx was quite right in studying in the British Museum. He was right in using the resources and in fact the liberal values of the civilization that he was trying to overcome, against it.</i><p>Remember, the goal of an activist is not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. The goal is to <i>convince</i> the baby to join the activist's side. Which you accomplish by living inside the baby's culture, appealing to its better nature, and using all the tools at your disposal, including the baby's tools.<p>It's not as if the whole idea of Google is fundamentally evil. It's a few specific aspects of Google's business practices that Cory dislikes -- aspects which, he might well argue, could easily be reformed without significantly affecting Google's prosperity.",1221051025

300321,comment,299851,299851,0,0,andyking,,,"I read an interesting article in the paper the other week about Zimbabwe, where the Z$ has been inflated so vastly that it is valueless for all practical purposes.<p>The government there have started to ration petrol and issue vouchers entitling the holder to 20 litres of the stuff. People started to swap these vouchers between themselves for other goods and services, and in many areas of the black market petrol vouchers are approaching the status of a de facto currency. Instead of a loaf of bread costing Z$6 billion or something, it'll cost you two litres of petrol.<p>It has fascinating implications--because the official currency is backed by nothing and is now meaningless, these bits of paper backed by a tangible quantity of a valuable commodity (ie. petrol) have effectively become their own currency. People are trading them with no intention of redeeming them for petrol, in the same way as you'd never go and ask for £10 of gold for your tenner. Perhaps something inventive like this would be a better way of running these town currencies than simply pegging them to the pound.",1221050834

300310,comment,299072,300273,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"<i>So there is an initial cash inflow at the end of the quarter and a cash outflow at the start of the next quarter. Just add that in your DCF analysis.</i><p>But you don't see it! All they have to do -- all they did -- was repo a little more at the end of the next quarter. RJR did this with cigarettes a while back: they offered discounts and 100% refunds to customers who bought just before the end of the quarter, and they ended up with extra cash for their 10-Q even though these actions hurt the business.<p>A few other scenarios a cash flow analysis misleads you on:<p>* Gradual liquidation: if a company sells off its inventory and equipment over time, it can show positive, growing cash flow (and a rapidly growing cash flow as a proportion of capital!) even though the business is falling apart.<p>* A company with a few long-lived assets, like an airline with just a couple planes, will show low earnings and high cash flow when it's not replacing a plane. This is one of those situations in which high cash flow is deceptive and earnings are not.<p><i>this company is projected to earn $1 million with annual growth of 10% from Year 1 to Year 10. But they have a major debt ($100 billion) that is due on Year 11</i><p>If the debt is normal debt, that shows up on the balance sheet, and the interest payments. If it's a zero-coupon bond, it shows up in the income statement but not the cash flow statement (although the tax effect shows up in both).<p>The point of earnings is to show what kind of value has been added to the business over time. We might call this Platonic version Earnings. Cash flow is a better way to approximate Earnings when companies are manipulating their earnings, but not when they're manipulating both. In the long run, given a perfect accounting system, DCF will equal Tangible Book + Discounted Earnings. Since accounting is imperfect, and a business can be manipulated to appear better than it really is <i>by any measure that people actually use to value companies</i>, picking just one kind of valuation is folly. I use free cash flow, but I use it judiciously -- I try to make it <i>as much like Earnings as possible</i>.",1221049650

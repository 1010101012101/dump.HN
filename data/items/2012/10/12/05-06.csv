Configuration of X and such were slightly easier with Linux (Slackware back then), and HW support was somewhat better (though FreeBSD came close).<p>Also Linux has the GNU utilities (GNU grep etc), which were somewhat more featureful than the BSD equivalents.

It's helped that I'm pretty well-qualified to judge these projects, though the only ones that looked unlikely to actually deliver have been <i>really</i> obvious (the ""projector"" that was supposed to be something mini-maglite sized that plugged into an iPhone headphone jack comes to mind) so it's not like it's actually taken all that much effort :-)<p>It also seems like the small-donation structure should make it difficult for any individual to have cause for action; I see some of KickStarter's recent changes as not wanting to even get into that fight, but that's because even <i>winning</i> would be expensive (and as has been suggested elsewhere in the thread, they're actually in it for the indie films.)<p>Or do you mean just the popularity risk, if enough projects don't deliver?",1350020405

This is doubly true online when it's trivial to get it a higher quality version without advertising for free.  I'm happy to pay the monthly fee for the convenience of advertisement free streaming (which is why I love netflix and spotify), but it's insulting to pay to watch advertising (and even more so when you also have a cable subscription).<p>All hulu plus does is what cable tv should have started doing years ago which is let you watch all shows on demand, it fixes nothing else and charges too much for that obvious privilege.

4643919,comment,4643611,4643798,4,0,kevingadd,,,"That sort of explicit type annotation approach falls over for the more complex cases, like the function signature one I described. For example, let's say you have an object called a StringBuilder, like the one in Java/C#, and it's got a method for appending text to it. In JS, you'd use it like this:<p><pre><code>    var bananaCount = 5;\n    var sb = new StringBuilder();\n    sb.append(""There are "");\n    sb.append(bananaCount);\n    sb.append("" bananas"");\n</code></pre>\nIf you merely add type annotations, you're not going to win much here:<p><pre><code>    /* v8-type: this(StringBuilder) (any) -> none */\n    sb.append = function (...) { ... };\n</code></pre>\nIf you go to the trouble of adding function overloading, maybe things get a little better - TypeScript does something like this hypothetical:<p><pre><code>    sb.append = {\n      /* v8-type: this(StringBuilder) (string) -> none */\n      function (...) { ... },\n      /* v8-type: this(StringBuilder) (number) -> none */\n      function (...) { ... }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nOK, but now what if you've got collection types? If you create an instance of List, what type is List.items? It'd have to be any[], unless you also add something like generics. So now you have to add a generics system or you have to introduce type casts, just to avoid having all your type information polluted by 'any's.<p>This may still be kind of unclear; it is often hard to see the failings of a type system until you see it in action on a larger application. In practice, it comes down to this: The type inferences that an engine like V8 or SpiderMonkey can draw at runtime end up being extremely accurate, and provide a lot more information than a compiler for a language like C or C# or Erlang has access to.",1350019501

Hulu cost them 9b in revenue, and only returned 600m.<p>(Whether this drop is actually because of Hulu or not is more at issue, but I can see them thinking it is.)",1350018908

Unless there is audio or video recordings of the incidents, where we can see, through an impartial view, exactly what the people he was interacting were doing and saying, we have to hear about them through his recollection of events. As he writes these events for us to read he's recalling what those people said or did, and his memory of those events is influenced by his own biases.",1350018845

It's the privilege of every person, regardless of race, to have an opinion.<p>Do you have evidence to support your claim? Are you talking about pure numbers or per capita?

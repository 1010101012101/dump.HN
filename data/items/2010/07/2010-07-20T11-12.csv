1531775,comment,1531441,1531683,0,0,klodolph,,,"You can litter printfs in your code, you'll just get a lot of hate if you do it in library code that you share.  It's fine when debugging to write a ""debug printf"" function using ""unsafePerformIO"".  Yes, it mixes side effects into pure code, but that's fine for debugging purposes.<p><pre><code>    -- totally OK! go ahead! it won't crash or anything!
    debugPrint :: String -> a -> a
    debugPrint s x = unsafePerformIO (putStrLn s >> return x)
</code></pre>
You could also implement a memoization function using ""unsafePerformIO"".  No, you won't get a visit from the FP purity police for doing so, it's perfectly fine.  Why?  Using ""unsafePerformIO"" in a function does NOT mean that that function is impure.  It merely means that the compiler will not inform you whether the function is pure or impure -- the compiler's safety checks are bypassed when you use the function.<p>Here's how I'd type the memoize function:<p><pre><code>    memoize :: Ord a => (a -> b) -> IO (a -> b)
</code></pre>
Notice how it gives you a pure function out.  No need to do stuff at the runtime level, or write compiler hints.  It just works.  If you want to memoize some nasty function:<p><pre><code>    -- Totally fine! Unless nastyFunction is polymorphic...
    nastyFunction :: Paper -> PublishedBook
    nastyFunctionMemoized = unsafePerformIO (memoize nastyFunction)
</code></pre>
If you're new to Haskell, don't write memoize yourself if you want a version that works with polymorphic functions as that requires some more advanced techniques.  Most people who need a memoized function don't need a polymorphic one though.",1279627050

We, startup people, are visionaries. We see possibilities in things that don't even exist yet. We envision our company as the next Google, and ourself as the next Steve Jobs. There is however a really long period of time, where you just have to be like a wind-mill and grind all day (mostly alone). Grinding requires a whole different mindset than envisioning. You need to switch modes in your brain and must find a way to enjoy the small activities, in other to make it.<p><i>How to enjoy grinding?</i>
Get absorbed in the daily small tasks and focus on them completely. Our brains are built up in a way, that it's impossible for us not to enjoy ourselves, if we really focus on a single task. Multitasking really kills the flow experience, so it's good to to avoid multitasking whenever possible.<p>Have a grand strategy and know where you want to be in life. Review your strategy every one or two weeks. Look at the week ahead, and the week just passing. Is there an activities you should focus on? Look for small improvements.<p>Track your resources (time and money). How much time and money do you spend on certain activities (you think you know, but you have no idea without actually tracking it). There are time tracking apps (eg. Eternity for iPhone), that could help. Look at your spendings (again time and money) each day and find things, that you could do better / things that you shouldn't do / things that you should do instead.<p>There are a million things that might work for you, but the bottom line is to find a way to enjoy the grinding process.",1279626568

You want to build something, but first you have to overcome many hurdles. Somewhere along on the way the balance of motivation and flexibility that keeps hackers working on projects gets out of whack, code stops getting written and your project dies.<p>Overcoming obstacles is what it's all about. If you avoid signs of failure [0] you have a better chance of completing the project. This of course doesn't mean the project is worthy of being called a product. Users just might not like what you have to offer. Not completing the project/product is the quickest way to failure. There are no easy answers here. Keep moving forward.<p>[0] Reading this motivates me to finish an article I've been planning on failure.

1531698,comment,1531441,1531441,0,0,ekidd,,,"Not as my _only_ programming language, no. But in general, why not? I value programming languages for what they can teach me. Haskell does make state slightly difficult. (If you need it, just use the IO monad, already. It doesn't bite.) But Haskell makes certain other things easy, things which are extraordinarily difficult in almost any other programming language.<p>For most of my professional life, I've been paid to program in Common Lisp, Scheme, Dylan, etc. Macros, to me, are an ordinary and natural part of programming. But after a while, macros become boring: 99% of them are just a thin syntactic wrapper over something I already know.<p>In Haskell, you don't build higher-order abstractions using macros. Instead, you build your higher-order abstractions using math. And math is almost entirely stateless, lazy and functional. You are forced to think in terms of combinators, abstract algebras, algebraic optimizations, and, yes, category theory. Category theory is the closest link between the lambda calculus and mathematical logic, for example, allowing you to transform some very exotic programming paradigms into actual code.<p>So, yes, Haskell is hard, and it's an ongoing research project. You will spend a lot of time reading papers. (And frankly, you don't want to maintain somebody else's code if you haven't read the same papers.) But some of those papers and theses have blown my mind more in a single weekend than some entire years of hacking in Lisp.<p>Haskell is not the most practical language I know. (State is not the biggest problem for me, but rather the lack of subtyping.) But Haskell is the language I'd be saddest to forget, and the language which has stretched my mind the most.",1279624227

1238834,comment,1235223,1237349,0,0,danieldon,,,"Windows (and most apps) in OS X are generally intended to do one thing. Even monolithic applications used full screen like Final Cut Pro are often made up of windowed components. Even so, there are also single-window apps that are intended to be used maximised and work perfectly well that way, such as Logic Studio. The problem would only be if you tried to use an app differently than it's intended to be used.<p>For many applications it doesn't make any sense to maximise them on a large screen. Very, very few web sites are wider than 1000px, so maximizing a browser on a large screen is pretty silly. Even if the site has a fluid layout, wide columns of text are horrible for reading.<p>Other applications don't even make any sense maximized, like a chat client like adium or a password manager. Apps like a terminal that could be used either maximized of windowed work perfectly fine either way.<p>And with software development the options are usually using emacs or vim full screen, which works perfectly well; using an IDE full screen, which works perfectly weel; or using a combination of smaller apps (eg, terminal, editor, SCM GUI, broswer, etc), which, despite being a different paradigm, also works perfectly well.<p>So, really, what are these scenarios when maximizing every window a) makes sense and b) is problematic on OS X?",1270313905

Few people remember that the original iPod was <i>supposed</i> to be a driver of consumers to the Macintosh platform. For a pretty long time you couldn't use one on any other platform other than a Macintosh.<p>iPhones sold well because the competition in the marketplace wasn't really all that great. Palm hadn't really done anything interesting in the years prior and Windows mobile has always been a joke. But remember the long lines of people trying to buy up a dozen or so iPhones <i>at the original price</i> sight unseen? I remember one lady standing outside a store with a stack of cash trying to buy phones off of people who got one for 2x the original purchase price.<p>And exactly like those two items, the iPad has people lined up getting as many as possible because their iPhones are so awesome. Even though the logic of blowing up a phone app onto a tablet makes little sense, and the iPad actually demonstrates a reduction in capability over the iPhone (no camera, seriously?).<p>I'd wager that it'll be just enough that people will slurp up the next version that'll have a camera and USB even though they already own the original.<p>The problem that people have is not that the iPad is a good product or not, it's that people are buying it without having any idea what it's like beyond ""it's a bigger iPhone"". If some other vendor had come out with <i>exactly</i> the same product, they wouldn't have flocked to it, because it's sight unseen. But stick an Apple logo on it, and have Jobs sit in a chair fiddling with it for 5 minutes, and it's sold out before it even hits the stores.",1270312280

It saved my wrists while writing my master&#x27;s thesis. I use an MS 4k for a while, but the Kinesis is lightyears ahead in terms of comfort.<p>It takes about a week to learn to type on it, as the columnar layout is very different, and I had to learn to retype some characters (like x, c, and v). It&#x27;s easy to switch back and forth between typical keyboards and the kinesis, so nothing&#x27;s lost in the learning.",1423839592

9044601,comment,9044131,9044131,0,0,falcolas,,,"To address pinky pain (based solely on my own experience, this is not ergonomic or medical advice), yes. In my experience, the most painful thing about typing for my fingers is the impact from bottoming out the keys while typing (which is required to activate the membrane switches found in most inexpensive keyboards). You&#x27;ll want to learn how to type without bottoming out the keys (or pick up some o-rings to soften the landing), but absolutely yes.<p>I would recommend the Cherry MX Brown switches: they require less effort to push down than other switches, but still offer some tactile feedback when they&#x27;re activated. If you&#x27;re comfortable relying on muscle memory instead of tactile feedback, then the red switches will be a real joy to use. Blues are nice, but in your typical office situation they are almost universally reviled.<p>One advantage of going for reds - there are a number of game peripheral manufacturers which offer keyboards based on the Cherry MX Red.",1423839475

I also have a camera capture the first few minutes of the door changing state.  I get alerts if the door is opened outside of normal away hours (8-4 on weekdays).  I also have a vacation mode that will control various lights in the house to simulate occupancy.  I also set up a nightlight mode that will detect motion after dark and turn lights on and off as you pass through the house.  This was all done with off-the-shelf components and minimal Lua scripting.  Admittedly not life-changing, but more useful than moving blinds up and down!",1423838852

Too many strategies are based on the principle that every packet is precious rather than total system goodput. Indeed TCP congestion control is really premised on loss happening - it keeps inching up the sending rate until a loss is induced and then it backs off a bit.<p>OTOH, TCP really performs poorly in the face of significant levels of loss. So high levels of loss specifically in HTTP really are a bad sign, at least as currently constructed.<p>Also worth being conerned with: losses that occur late in the path waste a lot of resources getting to that point that could instead be used by other streams sharing only part of the path. (e.g. If a stream from NYC to LAX experiences losses in SFO it is wasting bandwidth that could be used on someone else&#x27;s PHI to Denver stream). A packet switched network has to be sensitive to total system goodput, not just that of one stream.",1423838837

People should remember the days of when devices would be USB&#x27;ed into a computer and not work. I can hook up an iPhone, an iPod touch, and iPod shuffle and the system instantly recognizes them, checks them for any discrepancies between the two and will allow me to sync and backup. I cannot say the same for my Windows Phone 8.1 which getting to a mass storage state requires planetary alignments and a passing comet (Microsoft, please fix this!).<p>Pros:<p>-Your device is recognized, has a graphic showing you the device and provides you with great information on the contents of the device. You can also make changes and back up individual game state files in the iTunes.<p>-Backups and restores are simple.<p>-You can transfer photos from the file system to your hard drive outside of iTunes.<p>-You can keep track of authorized and non-authorized devices on your own computer without having to go through a web portal.<p>Cons:<p>-iTunes is constantly changing the user interface between versions and makes it a learning curve period of about four tries before learning where the buttons are and the path to accomplishing tasks. All of this done without any easy to follow instructions.<p>-The first install of iTunes on a new system is great, however, each additional update places a small unnoticeable mess on my computer (in terms of start up time and interaction), by the time I am on the tenth version update, I am questioning the usefulness of the program.<p>-Music transfer between devices and ripping from CD&#x27;s has a steep Choose Your Own Adventure feeling to it. Ripping a CD meant you had to choose between the AAC and MP3 format, while you can change these later, it is a pain. Transfer between devices has a prompt on whether you own the music. Compare this transfer within the Android or Windows Phone mass storage method and it is simply a drag and drop in the explorer file system.<p>Summary: iTunes creates a walled off system, but accepting it is much better than the messes that were preceding it.",1423838115

As the article mentions but doesn&#x27;t really follow through the logic of, trading a light switch flip for a smart phone fumble just isn&#x27;t a win.<p>But remote access is one of those cases that is a win. I have a relative that spends a lot of time about 1000 miles away for business and he&#x27;s gotten some mileage out of his remote furnace control. Access for people with physical issues also makes sense, but relative to what I think the market is &quot;expected&quot; to be for this stuff, that&#x27;s still quite a small niche too. (Large in absolute terms, that is, but nowhere near &quot;we&#x27;re going to have one of these in every house!&quot;)<p>Beyond that, though, what&#x27;s the best case scenario in practice? I spend perhaps a minute during the day <i>tops</i> flipping light switches... if you 100% eliminate that I will, frankly, not particularly notice. My heater already has a standard modern (and therefore a bit featureful) electronic control and I already don&#x27;t use its sophisticated features.<p>This isn&#x27;t one of those cases where technical advances just made home automation possible, like the way tablets were a joke until all the pieces came together for the iPad and gave us a practical device for the first time. The tech has been here for decades, and it has never taken off, even among the geek set. I think the problem is there just isn&#x27;t a <i>use case</i> here.<p>At the risk of sounding simply contrarian, I&#x27;m still not convinced the whole &quot;Internet of Things&quot; isn&#x27;t going to fizzle out the same way. It&#x27;s a basic principle of good software engineering that it isn&#x27;t enough to just throw code at people and hope; you need a use case that makes sense.

Maybe there is a way I can change that in the settings, but that shouldn&#x27;t be the default behavior.",1423836629

9044348,comment,9043571,9043950,0,0,tenfingers,,,"This rings a huge bell^H^H^Hgong to me.<p>MPL is relatively complete, but it has been one of the worst libraries for plotting that I&#x27;ve ever used. You can make nice plots with it, but you can do the same using most of the other libraries as well.<p>It&#x27;s terribly inefficient when used with the OO interface, which is allegedly the &quot;way to go&quot;. But in reality it&#x27;s so verbose, that almost everybody is using the pylab wrapper at least in parts to reduce the boilerplate you need. Not to mention that the pylab wrapper in itself is a very crappy compromise with a lot of state. I never used Matlab, but I certainly know that I don&#x27;t like the way it works.<p>Even basic stuff, like the ability to customize/cycle the color of the series in a central place (which is key to being able to use palettes efficiently) is not there. You need to supply color values manually!<p>I routinely use a lot of plotting programs, but despite its shortcomings I keep reaching &quot;gnuplot&quot; very often. The syntax is arcane, but gets the job done quickly. You can customize the plot in a few commands, and often a simple ~/.gnuplotrc with a few defaults can make the plots look <i>identical</i> to MPL.<p>The &quot;publication quality&quot; is a red herring. What makes the plot publication quality is not the software. As long as it renders with AA or at 300 dpi, you can get the same output from most of the plotting packages.<p>Now, speaking about plotting packages, I&#x27;ve been using &#x27;seaborn&#x27; a lot recently, which helps in reducing the clutter you need around MPL. Unfortunately, like most of the packages that just wraps core functionality, it&#x27;s sometimes impossible to customize the plots the way you need. For example, you cannot get decent B/W plots, since you cannot customize the line types (again, missing functionality from MPL which should be core). The same on gnuplot takes 2 seconds. You would think that plotting in B/W should be common, given that often you need to pay extra to publish color figures, and this clashes a bit in the &quot;publication quality&quot; issue, which seaborn also claims.<p>A package in pythonland that shows promise is yhat/ggplot, which is a copy of the former package in R. I&#x27;m not superfond of the ggplot way of plotting: it requires a lot of data alignment before you can use it effectively (contrast this to seaborn/gnuplot, which also lets you plot any series without much fuss). But it&#x27;s already way better than plain MPL.<p>Unfortunately mastering a plotting package takes a long time. I&#x27;m curious about impressions about alternative plotting packages to python, geared at <i>figures</i> (so excluding interactive/javascript/web based plotting backends).",1423836597

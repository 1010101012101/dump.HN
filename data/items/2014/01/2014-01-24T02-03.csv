Thank you for pointing that out.<p>Alas, I must confess that I <i>have</i> written Visual Basic (VBscript) code in Emacs.<p>A while back I was screwing around with a project which attempted to generate, via the Windows speech synthesis API, output vaguely resembling SHODAN from the System Shock games (example: [1]). The most I can say for it is that I didn&#x27;t <i>entirely</i> fail; despite having access to a quite good female voice (NeoSpeech &quot;Kate&quot;), and despite SAPI 5 offering what I found a surprising degree of flexibility, there&#x27;s only so much you can do with it; I got closer than I expected, but not close enough to think it worth releasing. [a]<p>In any case, VBScript is the handiest way I could find to screw around with SAPI, and it turns out there is a Visual Basic mode for Emacs [2]; I found it to be remarkably not bad. Nothing could make working with Visual Basic other than painful, but Emacs comes as close as anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iZMD_eCpEo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iZMD_eCpEo</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/visual-basic-mode.el"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/visual-basic-mode.el</a><p>[a] I&#x27;ve just unearthed it, and it hasn&#x27;t yet succumbed to bit rot; maybe I&#x27;ll throw it up on my Github account just for the hell of it.",1390532399

You can probably explain both in terms of the other, and although calculus is probably more useful to explain a wider range of applications (via more complex maths that themselves are best explained with calculus), algebra will often do the trick.

7113099,comment,7111360,7111491,0,0,bane,,,"> Can someone shed some light on what microsoft has been selling that everyone wants? I&#x27;m really curious now.<p>Operating systemwise? An unbelievably vast software ecosystem and a highly performant, user friendly, highly hardware tolerant, flexible OS. There are things I like to do that are either impossible or such a giant PIA on my rMBP that I just don&#x27;t do them. Coming from Windows-land, the software ecosystem on Macs, especially the kind of hobbyist software I like to monkey around with, feels like a barren wasteland comparatively.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love my rMBP, and I get my work done on it well enough, it&#x27;s the best portable virtualization hardware I&#x27;ve ever owned and the second Apple laptop I&#x27;ve owned. But I&#x27;ve also realized that I spend 95% of my time on it either SSH&#x27;d into something else, in a browser or using software that&#x27;s also available on Windows (and often works better, like Office of Chrome). I can do those things with hardware that&#x27;s 1/5th the cost and have it be almost exactly as performant for those use-cases.<p>For my next laptop, if I can find a high quality portable Windows laptop with good virtualization characteristics I&#x27;d be 50/50 on not buying another Apple product <i>because</i> of the things I have to set aside due to the spare software ecosystem. There&#x27;s also enough day-to-day irritants and workarounds with the hardware and especially OS X (and especially the stinking pile of garbage that is Finder) that I find I spend most of my time trying to avoid the OS. For portability and form factor, a Surface Pro 2 is definitely something I&#x27;m considering as a next portable.<p>It seems these days, Apples get used in software development and server admin functions or among liberal arts students. And for the typical users (not the HN crowd) justifying an expensive price tag for marginally better portability for something that gets used mostly as a glorified web browsing terminal and Word/Excel computer is not a smart purchase decision for most consumers.",1390532100

The reason for the second exception is obvious: their work is needed to make even more money from the money and every trick is played, to have the smartest, best guys getting the job done ... and get it done better and better.<p>Problem is: The whole thing breaks our society. Middle classes are already melting massively in many countries. The possessions of the worlds are concentrating in the hands of very few people more and more. Those people make our laws! The other people become poorer, even in the situation that the overall worlds possessions expand massively. The countries are already so much in dept, that many of them can not pay even the interest. Even the US is so much in dept, that there seems to be no possibility to get ever rid of it.<p>Nobody seems to realize, that while we are talking, investment companies are roaming the world for land, for houses, for companies to buy them, exploit them and throw it away when not needed (and not useful) any more. The wealth of the world gets accumulated in the hand of investment companies and the super-rich.<p>By rising the value of pure money investments, the value of human labor (to a more and more extend even high-paid and high-value labor) is degrading.",1390531554

Pay lines for postdocs are effectively set by a centalized agency - NIH guidelines.  There&#x27;s limited market and a captive, oversupplied labor pool, zero ownership of the means of production (&quot;it all goes for the collective effort&quot;).  Advancement is not meritocratic, but rather a combination of being in the right place when a position opens up, and who you know (&quot;political connections&quot;).  As a result you have absurdities like me:  a PhD four years out of grad school (10 years off my bachelor&#x27;s) that can run circles around bosses both intellectually and technically, experience in multidisciplinary research up the wazoo - making $40k/year.  Meanwhile, the head of the institute built a $37 million vanity building, excuse me, lab facility, and does media gigs showing off his tesla roadster to David Frost - largely extracted off of state funds by skimming off of grants (&quot;overhead&quot;) and also state-provided &quot;R&D and investment vehicles&quot; - SBIRs, etc.<p>Well, at least I&#x27;m not an H-1B.

I&#x27;m much happier.  When I do work, I know that what I&#x27;m doing is making a difference -if minor- in people&#x27;s lives, not working to advance the agenda of a faceless bureaucracy doling out grants mostly administered by scientists who couldn&#x27;t hack it in research and so went to work for the bureaucracy (dunning-kruger effect).",1390531328

I&#x27;m thinking about a subset of humanity that actually gives a damn, and works towards a change.</i><p>Yeah, I think we&#x27;re talking about two different groups. The group I&#x27;m talking about is specifically those with capital/wealth--in part, the &quot;investor class&quot; if you will. This group does <i>materially</i> dictate the world&#x27;s various agendas/priorities.<p>OTOH, I would say that you&#x27;re already a member of &quot;your group&quot; (i.e. the group that gives a damn), just by virtue of the fact that you seem to give a damn. So, when you mentioned that you hoped to join the &quot;small group&quot; at some point, I took that as an acknowledgment of my position: that is, giving a damn and having your own priorities is not enough, without the capital/access to actually do something.<p>><i>There&#x27;s a popular meme here that &quot;the solution must be political in nature, not technological&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;d say legal in nature, not technological. And, that&#x27;s purely a practical matter. That is, it&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m overjoyed about the state of our legal system. It&#x27;s more that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s practical to play technological cat-and-mouse with our own government and expect to win. So, IMO, if we don&#x27;t at least attempt to constrain the government legally, then we&#x27;ve lost hope.<p>But, I digress. To your bigger point, yes, seeking legal redress does have political implications. And there&#x27;s no doubt that we need to fix our politics, but again, I think the problems are one and the same: the few moneyed interests I mentioned dictate our agenda, in part through our politics. So, while our politics appear to be broken due to sheer incompetence, they actually are not. They simply serve an agenda that is not &quot;for the people&quot;, while attempting to maintain the facade that they are.<p>><i>...will burn this planet down to the ground.

Beyond mere politics though, I&#x27;m lamenting the access to power to <i>all</i> but a few. That is to say, there are certainly also many thoughtful, caring people in the world whose ideas/actions could help to shape it and make it a better place for all. In other words, it&#x27;s not simply a world of a few moneyed people who know what&#x27;s best for everyone on one side vs. a slew of completely ignorant, incompetent, malicious dullards on the other.

It&#x27;s like very few &quot;peons&quot; understand the mentality of those who are &quot;in charge&quot; - e.g. the Clueless, Loser, Sociopath hierarchy of how businesses are structured.  There has been a recent spate of stories across the web about how wealth affects people&#x27;s mentality and behavior - I am reminded now of a story about India and how the stark class differences there motivate those at the upper end to treat those not in their own class as even human....  it is more subtle, but just as bad here in the UK.  Why would it be any different in the West?  How in the world is Silicon Valley, or IT in general, any much different than any other business sector?  It is a fundamental characteristic of capitalism that capital will try to exploit labor as much as possible and by any means available.  Engineers getting $250K a year is irrelevant - those people are still just &quot;house niggers&quot;...<p>As a middle class American, admittedly clueless, the education I&#x27;ve gotten over the past decade has been eye opening.  And a bit late; I wish I&#x27;d learned this stuff years ago. But that is the dark side of being an engineer - the work and the creative aspects can swamp everything else.  Other creative professions have this same basic problem, with the business major types exploiting them as much as possible. And basic Marxist theory is even more forbidden than rational thought about drugs in America...<p>i am not a raving Marxist, but after the last 4 years of my life getting shafted by one of the new crop of robber barons (an out and out sociopath) (yes, I have finally graduated from the Loser class (or been expelled)) it&#x27;s...  christ.  Humanity is so tiresome. I&#x27;ve had some great bosses, mind you, and worked for some good companies.  But the capital-labor relationship is fundamentally deteriorating and with the coming rise of automation and increased population and refusal to raise taxes and all these other social forces I see, the future looks very dystopian over the next 20 years.  Things are getting such that the only logical position to take is that you incorporate yourself and thus you can act as sociopathic as you need to, given everyone else is acting the same.  Does anyone with any sense want to live in such a world?  I&#x27;d like to just do a good day&#x27;s work, get paid fairly for it and not have to spend more time figuring out how to protect myself from getting screwed over - or figuring out how to screw over the next guy.  I can&#x27;t do my best possible work otherwise.  I&#x27;ve got better things to do than play social games.  This is something Ayn Rand touched upon in Altas Shrugged, as reviled as that book might be.  Lots of capitalists these days are nothing but the social leeches that she railed against, despite their hypocritical protests to the contrary.<p>I guess I am a Marxist, or at least see the slice of truth about life and society that it reveals. There is a value in honest work, in creating something useful for society - that is something fundamental to being a real engineer.  IT likes to claim that is a fundamental value of the profession, but I don&#x27;t see that anymore (in general).  There is too much money sloshing around. Things are getting out of balance.  I can only hope the social strife prevalent in the 30s (go read some American history) comes about again - OWS and the protests in the Bay Area now are only the beginning.  Then again, the resurgence of the fundamental social forces motivating the 60s that happened in the very early days of the rave scene got explicitly squashed by the authoritarian parts of the power structures in society....

I&#x27;ve owned laptops with worse keyboards. It&#x27;s a little loose balanced on your lap (although it&#x27;s workable) but fine on a desk. I need to get a Bluetooth mouse though because the touchpad is terrible (and of course very few desktop apps are comfortable when using touch/pen).<p>I find drawing on the screen is a little weird because it doesn&#x27;t have the friction of pen and paper, but it&#x27;s comfortable to hold and write. I&#x27;ve tried styluses on iOS and the Wacom pen is just miles better.<p>I&#x27;ve tried 4 programs and apps. OneNote (Modern app) is pretty good for handwritten notes. It does pretty much everything the desktop version does. Evernote (Modern app) is like the iPad version, i.e. very stripped down and it doesn&#x27;t support pen input. Of course you can use the full desktop app, which does support ink notes. Windows Journal is a bit of a legacy; so far I prefer OneNote for handwritten entries and mind maps but Journal is the only packaged program that does handwriting recognition. There&#x27;s a desktop app for handwritten math formula entry but I haven&#x27;t used it. Finally, because I take notes in mind map format, I&#x27;ve installed the desktop XMind, where the UI does not scale on a high-DPI screen, but if you know the keyboard shortcuts it&#x27;s usable.<p>So honestly, right now, it&#x27;s not the magic note taking machine I&#x27;d hoped for.

The article states that the planet had 400ppm 2-4 million years ago. I guess my question is, why is it bad if humans cause this when it wasn&#x27;t bad when other phenomena caused it?<p>2) Could the earth have a feedback mechanism that we don&#x27;t yet understand to deal with this on its own? These seem so common in nature on a small scale.

Humanity just won&#x27;t make the levels of fossil fuel cuts that the article says are necessary.<p>---<p>Also, to respond to your ant analogy - I gather that you equate my question of the average temp for 2014 to predicting waves from minute to minute in the analogy.

The algorithm really works and it says the average value is 1000x higher than now. Obviously, people could use it to make a killing, even though the algorithm does not claim what the year to year value will be. I could explain my logic over and over, but most people are simply not going to risk their own money on it. However, if I correctly predicted the value of the S&P500 for 2014, 2015, and 2016, I bet lots of people would take my advice for 2017.

Not really! (Paper checks - even today - move more money than Credit/Debit cards)<p>ACH is far more complex then being able to withdraw money from someone&#x27;s bank account with just their account number. To be able to initiate an ACH transaction bank level authentication is needed and it can only be done from an authorized bank. Can you give me a use case where someone can withdraw money from my bank account using just my bank account number ?<p>Any ideas ?<p>There is no logical reason for someone not to give out their bank account number anymore than their Credit/Debit card number. In both cases consumers are indemnified by federal regulations. \nHowever perception is bigger than reality - just like in the early days of the Internet/e-commerce people were afraid of using their credit card numbers online so are they wary of using their bank account numbers online.",1390529039

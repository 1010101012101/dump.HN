This is an app I wrote to scratch an itch and try some new techniques (including lots of ReactiveCocoa).<p>I'll also be releasing the source in a few days along with a blog post about the process from start to finish.<p>In short, Vinylogue is an iOS app that's like TimeHop for music. It uses your Last.fm listening data, so if you haven't been an active user there it's not going to be much fun. You can still try it out though and use my Last.fm username (ybsc).

The most significant innovations are often iterations. (Google comes to mind.)<p><i>Why do we do this? Because we want to get rich, of course.</i><p>I disagree with ""Because we want to get rich"". And I definitely disagree with ""of course"". Real hackers do this because we just <i>have to</i>. It just so happens that currently it's also a great way to make money. Many of us hacked long before it was this way and many of us still hack for little or nothing (side projects, open source, etc.)<p><i>But technologists used to work on big problems.</i><p>We still do, probably more than ever. But if you're busy reading Techcrunch and going to conferences and hackathons, you'd probably never know about what the other 99% of us are doing.<p><i>They did it because technology is about improving the human condition...</i><p>There are many ways to do this, all with relative importance. Putting a man on the moon was definitely cool, but so is getting fresh produce to your supermarket (which probably benefits more people). Like a football team, we hackers all do our part in the blocking, tackling, running, throwing, catching, and scoring.

There are companies of 1 to 2 people who can now outsource almost every physical aspect of their service so that they can focus on their core product. Do I hire a team of sysadmins and technicians to maintain a server farm to 1) pay, 2) train, 3) meet with regularly, or do I simply host my service on AWS? One could argue that AWS is nothing but a first-world solution, but hey, it's responsible for hosting a HUGE number of companies! These ""small"", ""iterative"", ""derivative"" services can have a huge impact on industries. Just because they're not devoted to saving Africa or rescuing animals or ending world hunger doesn't mean they're not important.<p><i>> There are some notable ones, but it seems to be the road less traveled.</i><p>It's funny that you mention the 'road less traveled'. People use that phrase in allusion to Robert Frost's ""The Road Not Taken,"" where the narrator opines about coming to a fork in the road and wondering about how his life would be different had he taken the other path.<p>The funny part is that Frost was really being sarcastic and basically saying that it makes no difference which road you'll take. So yes, you can ""go after the big problems"" consciously and take that ""road less traveled,"" but in the end, BOTH paths can result in solving big problems (or not solving anything).",1364921490

5480474,comment,5479848,5480264,52,0,orangethirty,,,"But they do. Let me explain. I grew up in a <i>barrio</i>, which is a latin ghetto. Junked cars in front lawns, domestic disturbances every night, shootings, drugs, all of that stuff.\nEvery kid in there made money by pure hustle. There were <i>no</i> jobs available for any of us. Some kids cut hair (then went on to become barbers), others worked on cars, but most sold drugs. There were startups, but all were of the illegal variety. No one had any type of business permit, and almost everybody sold illegal substances (including alcohol).<p>Some people did make it out of poverty and went on to live productive lives. Others, the ones that sold drugs, either ended up being junkies, dead, jailed, or just disappeared. This due to the type of business they got into. I'm sure that had these kids gone into real businesses like mowing lawns, painting houses, working at a farm, selling eggs, or anything positive, they would be good productive people.<p>I was lucky. At age 9 I started selling candy. Then I joined Amway at age 14. Then I opened up my first (illegal) auto shop some years after. Why always had the option of selling drugs, but it just wasn't attractive as a business. For every sale I would make about a dollar. If I made 30 sales in a day (given the competition from other dealers), then I would be putting myself at risk for $210 week (you worked 7 days a week). Not worth it. I did not make that much selling candy, but at least I was not getting shot at. And with Amway, made twice as that much by selling soap.<p>Why did I make it out and not others? I was lucky. My parents were professionals, the only ones in the whole barrio. The other kid's parents were not. They also had to incur into dealing drugs, or other illegal activities. The issue is that these people did not do this because they wanted, they did so because <i>they had no other option</i>. Dealing drugs was the only job they could get, much less do. So the kids were grandfathered into selling drugs, too.<p>Can poor kids do startups to get out of poverty? Absolutely. But they need to have the right information to do so. Their parents need to have legal jobs available. But not fast food jobs, but real stuff. Construction workers, electricians, mechanics, etc. Those jobs are gone these days.<p>I'm just lucky to be a software engineer. My best friend? In jail.",1364921478

The only thing that this seems to simplify is the declaration of the range of scales when they depend on the width or height of the canvas.<p>But maybe I was mistaken on first glance.

That's what rich means.<p>b - Startup founders are rich or come from rich communities. So are their investors and advisors. They are also young, urban, techie, etc.  So, they see the things these markets need and make products for them.

5480188,comment,5479848,5479848,7,0,austenallred,,,"I see every innovation as a conglomeration of different things one has experienced. Or in other words, iterations.<p>This goes to the core of creativity: Creativity usually comes from combining things or ideas that are normally compartmentalized in others' minds. Have you ever noticed how most of the startup founders you know have a wide diversity of experiences to draw upon? Most of them have lived in foreign countries and are well acquainted with subcultures most of us are barely even aware of. The reason curiosity is such a positive trait is because it gives you more inputs to operate off of. The article gives a perfect example:<p>""A long time ago, when I was a columnist at the Las Vegas CityLife, my editor called me up one day and asked if me if I ever wanted to find out what was in the storm drains under the city. And because I have notoriously poor self-preservation skills, I grabbed a Mag-Lite and headed on down."" That's the kind of crazy, insatiable curiosity that ends in you seeing the world differently. That's why innovators seem so crazy, but what they're doing makes complete sense in their minds.<p>In other words, in my mind it's impossible to draw a line between ""innovation"" and ""iteration,"" because every innovation is really an iteration of different ideas no one had ever really put together before.",1364919336

We just don't look like one :) Tom (tptacek) always accuses me of not selling enough, so I'll give it a try.<p>Your question is actually very open-ended. We have roughly 4,000 R&D employees, so you can imagine the work is very diverse across the company. Teams are roughly 4-8 people at the lowest level and group up into larger organizations organized by product type (equities, fixed income, etc.).<p>I happen to work on infrastructure for the Professional service (aka Terminal). Our team has very little interaction with anything finance related and most of our work is related to evolving the entire platform forward and making forward-looking changes. Back in 2005, we converted all of our higher-level ""app"" development to server-side JS (custom, Spidermonkey based) and now run probably the largest server-side JS stack in the world (~20MM LOC). We migrated a lot of our GUI toolkit to be scripted as well (LUA this time) to allow us to more easily evolve it. And now we're evolving it, embedding WebKit and pushing bugfixes and feature enhancements to do what we need (our fork is on GH). We're helping define and implement CSS3 Grid spec and help implement ES6 generators among other things. We built and run a third-party app store within the Terminal. Over the past decade we've rebuilt the C++ foundation of the company from the ground up, starting with our own STL implementation using the Lakos allocator model (Lakos and a few other C++ committee members work here). We have a huge wealth of awesome C++ libraries that we started open-sourcing and will continue to add more layers as time goes by.<p>All of what I mentioned is stuff done by the infrastructure team, and we're a tiny percentage of the overall R&D population. Other teams get to do fun stuff as well. The mortgage team ported long-running ABS OAS calculations from Linux farms to GPU clusters and wrote a Python based cash flow engine from the ground up, potentially helping define the SEC's Python-files-must-be-included rules.<p>We run a worldwide network with somewhere around 35,000 circuits in 180+ countries. We ingest anywhere from 45-60 billion ""ticks"" daily aggregate from feeds in all of these countries. We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 80,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one ""feed"") from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, etc. We also design our own hardware in-house -- everything from keyboards and monitors, to custom ASICs for authentication/subscription tokens and PCIe hardware security modules for our certificate infrastructure. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com, BGOV, BLAW, Black, etc) uses mostly Rails stacks and everything you would expect to find in a web shop.<p>Oh, and we have a TV station, radio station, etc. They innovate too. Bloomberg TV is the first non-OTA channel to be distributed via Aereo, for instance :)<p>We could use a motto like ""We do a lot of stuff.""",1364919305

I started meds about a decade ago and I have slowly been weaning myself off of them for the past 6 months.  Once you're hooked (taking a daily dosage) on the meds it is remarkably difficult to get off of them.  Mostly because you feel like crap when you're not on the them and of course the ADD/HD symptoms do return.<p>As someone who is actively struggling to concentrate while writing a thesis (hey look I'm on HN now...) I have a few tips that I hope can help you.<p>Working environment is important.  If you're goofing off in your current work spot... then get out of there!  Find some other place that you can work from and try working there.  You will be surprised how a change in environment can affect your concentration. My experience has been Public and University Libraries are undervalued work spaces.  Cafes work really well for me because some part of my brain wants me to appear productive in front of other people, so I goof off less in open working spaces where others can see my screen.  I use that to help me concentrate.  The point is find that spot that works for you and fight for it.  Also don't be afraid to get nomadic, its OK to switch working spots when you feel like it.<p>Make Lists.  Every time you sit down to do work, spend 30 seconds and jot down what you want to do in that particular working session.  Then leave that list in front of you.  The visual cue of the list in front of you will help you get back to work when your mind strays.  It also helps you align your thoughts.<p>In terms of staying on topic I think it has more to do with personal issues.  I've noticed that when work/class induces a lot of stress, that I goof off more and I do less work.  So for me, getting over that stress and just simply enjoying the work has been hugely beneficial.  I'm not sure if this stress induced distraction is a universal thing, maybe others can chime in.<p>Finally go get some exercise.  Its a panacea and helps everything from ADD/HD symptoms to curing depression.",1364918712

I'd make the note specific to the person you're emailing (I liked portfolio piece x and would like something like the operation of y which impressed me), state clearly that if you can come to an agreement you're ready to commit to work right away without getting competitive bids, provide sketches or something concrete that shows you didn't just dream up this idea an hour ago and will have forgotten about it tomorrow, state your approximate budget and note that the money is in the bank, and make it clear some how you're not emailing the whole planet.<p>Lots of these people will be happy to work with you - but if they state on the web they're looking for work they've probably been burned a number of times by people who demanded a lot of attention and yet never had the actual intention of hiring them (even if they thought they did at the time). Do make sure that's not you.<p>EDIT: I Just saw one of your follow ups where you said ""I'm not sure if what I'm asking for is $1k or $10k"" - that's your problem, you probably are one of these bad leads at least at this point.

People looked at them the same way they look at RIM today. They were has-beens living on borrowed time. They were in really really really big trouble as a company. Steve Jobs took the reigns of Apple as interim CEO in September of 1997  (<a href=""http://www.apple.com/ca/press/1997/09/InterimCEO.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/ca/press/1997/09/InterimCEO.html</a>). Roughly 8 months later in May of 1998, the iMac is announced, and Apple's second act -- one in which it is an industrial design leader -- begins.<p>So existence by sheer momentum lasted approximately two years for Apple. I would say that the iPhone was RIM's Windows 95. Hell, Microsoft has pivoted and Windows Phone 7 is a great competitor to iPhone. Google's first shot at an iPhone competitor was also pretty good and took them a little over a year to match. But RIM? They've let the better part of 4 years pass without matching, let alone one-upping, the iPhone (and now Android/Windows Phone 7). Momentum does not last that long.<p>* edited to fix Win 95 launch date (thanks meric)",1294623204

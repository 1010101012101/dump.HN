I first started to use it when I needed a small, but flexible language that worked well on Windows. newLISP does the job just right.<p>A nice feature is the ability to compile a newLISP script to a standalone executable that does not require a newLISP interpreter. I hacked together a quick and dirsty script that my colleages at work like a lot - a script that cleans up crap in their windows profile directory. :-)<p>I have no experience with other LISPs though, and thus am not competent to say whether newLISP is a ""true"" LISP. To me that really does not matter - as long as the tool does the job.<p>Good luck.",1198712855

92810,comment,92792,92792,0,0,pg,,,"He's roughly correct.  Yet if warrior societies are so bad, why are they so common?  The answer is that they used to work. In low tech warfare, the fiercest and most cohesive side wins, even if they're outnumbered 10 to 1.  So for most of history warrior aristocracies have controlled territories way out of proportion to their numbers. <p>Industrialization changed the balance.  If you have guns and your opponents have spears, it doesn't matter how fierce they are.<p>The traditions of warrior socities may be obsolete, but it seems provincial to call them ""toxic.""  Members of those societies would be equally contemptuous of our traditions.  For example, our lack of loyalty.  We're nicer to women, but would we be as willing to die to save a friend?  We're more sensitive, but are we as honest?",1198711707

92808,comment,92788,92788,0,0,cperciva,,,"<i>Amazon S3 seems to be the ""in"" solution right now, but when you do the math, it gets pretty expensive as you start nearing multiple TB of storage.</i><p>I've done the math, and (at least compared to renting dedicated servers) Amazon S3 is reasonably priced well into the TB range.  The cheapest prices I've seen advertised for bulk storage servers online are at softlayer, where it's possible to get down to about $80/TB-month (they have TB drives for $50/month, but you need a server to contain them) compared to S3's $140/TB-month ($0.15 / 2^30 bit-months); but that's for unreplicated storage, and you'll find it very hard to get good performance and reliability (considering that drives will inevitably fail) for less than a 2x increase in price.<p>I haven't done the math on colocation (and that involves more of a judgement call, valuing capital costs vs. monthly expenses) but I suspect that any system you can design which is anywhere near as reliable as S3 will end up being fairly close to it in price.",1198710585

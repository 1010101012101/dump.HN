2041600,comment,2041510,2041565,0,0,lukeschlather,,,"I got my first cell phone in 2008 as a junior in college, recognizing that it was getting to be too difficult looking for internships relying on my landline. I didn't want anything fancy, so I just got the phone that came ""free"" with the plan. That phone had a camera and a basic Internet browser.<p>Based on that, I'm pretty sure we'll be seeing smartphones offered at roughly the same subsidized price point as a dumbphone by 2012, and I'd actually call that a pretty conservative estimate; they could definitely show up in the first half of 2011. Giving someone a $100-200 phone with a 100mb data cap is nothing, provided you can upsell a reasonable number of them to a 1GB data cap by the end of their contract.<p>I could also see data/text-only phones showing up with 250MB-1GB caps in the near future, possibly rolled in with some VOIP app that bills voice as data. (It's an accident of a minimally competitive marketplace with minimal regulation that we haven't seen these already.)",1293415016

2041588,comment,2041510,2041510,0,0,earl,,,"Am I the only person who loves my dumb phone?<p>For starters, it just works.  A good friend has a Motorola Droid X.  Android is a useless piece of shit -- his <i>alarm clock</i> keeps crashing with NPEs.  This was one of the premier android phones when he bought it, and he left it completely stock.  I, along with many friends of my generation, use our phones as our alarm clock and watch, so this is obviously pretty useless.<p>Second, my three year old motorola krzr is robust.  It's been face down in my pants pocket while sliding down 500 feet of ice when I wiped out on some really icy moguls last year.  That shattered the front.  It's survived prolly 100+ impacts in my coat while snowboarding, though none as brutal as the above.  The paint is peeling off the entire back.  It's dented, prolly from a different fall snowboarding.  It fell out of my coat pocket and hung out in the snow for 8 hours next to our car last year whence I fortunately saw it before driving off.  Through all of it, it still makes / receives calls and makes / receives texts.  I'm pretty sure I'd kill a smartphone inside 5 snowboarding days, tops.  I still get 30 hours of standby battery life, though I'll probably have to replace the battery soon.  My friends w/ iphones and the like seem to rush between charges, and last weekend at the ski house, there was a rush to find the one person who brought an iphone charger.  I didn't charge all weekend.<p>tl;dr -- dumb phones are robust, have great battery life, and generally work well at their limited functionality",1293414606

They are (IMHO) a result of both their social context and their volition.<p>You could say that, based on your logic, Hitler was not a self-made man but was the result of his social context - his rise to power was truly phenomenal and would you therefore say he had no ""self-made"" qualities?

I do not think that is a very useful way to evaluate programming languages.<p>Do you have actual data showing productivity gains for using Java over Scala or other languages that run on the JVM?

I pointed that out today, and a new rule was implemented, saying that if a cracked application has a built in (fully featured) timed trial when it detects that it is a pirated version, then that check should remain intact and un-patched, otherwise the crack or request for the crack will be removed. Not perfect, but at least a step in the right direction (they didn't have an argument when it was brought up, because their reasoning is that people want a fair chance to try apps before paying, which this compromise allows).<p>I'd link to the thread on their forums about this new rule, but I'm assuming that most people in here are iOS developers who seem to be against this, so you probably don't have an account on their website and can't view the post.",1293412322

The tracking of consumers is rarely seen as a problem by most businesses.  Most businesses want to know as much as possible about their customers.  But this is very much a problem for consumers who care about their privacy.<p><i>""How do you request payment from an overdue customer when you can't even tell who he/she is?""</i><p>Just insist that they pay up front for any service you provide.  A month's payment upfront isn't too unreasonable, is it?  In fact, it's a rather tried and true business model.  And it's not at all incompatible with anonymous payments from anonymous customers.<p>So that's not really a problem at all for such an anonymous system.<p>But there are some HUGE problems with it, which seem (at this point) completely insurmountable.<p>One problem is that anonymous money transfers aren't really looked at kindly by the IRS, the DEA, and various other organizations who have a vested interest in keeping track of who's paying whom and for what.<p>Then there are concerns that anonymous communication (nevermind payments) would facilitate terrorism, organized crime, and the like.<p>Then there are problems with getting the general public to care enough to use and even demand such systems.  And even if that somehow miraculously came about, they need to properly use such systems without inadvertently leaking information about themselves all over the place.<p>The system and software involved would also have to be made to be brain-dead easy to use, and relatively foolproof (which, if you are familiar with the pain and security subtleties of digital key management and proper encryption use is no short order).<p>I could probably list half a dozen more major problems with a attempting to create a fully anonymous system.. but I think you probably get the idea by now.<p>It's just not going to happen any time soon.",1293411815

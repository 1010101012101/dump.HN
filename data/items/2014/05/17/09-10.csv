Any harebrained idea that comes up in this process has a non-zero chance of being implemented just by the power of low participation or ambiguous opinions.<p>IMO you&#x27;re a bit oversimplifying here. There are various hurdles to take when you want to vote on a certain thing. Whether things are accepted or declined depends on various things and can change because of some little thing in a week.<p>The serious risk blabla is always a thing which various parties bring up in various votes.

You have to arse around with it first and install a jar to the token to give it that capability (I remember it&#x27;s all official from YubiKey, they just don&#x27;t ship the keys with that capability).<p>Then, I simply NFC it to my Android phone, and the YubiKey neo app shows the 2FA tokens for all the secrets on that key. You can also password encrypt the key, so that someone can&#x27;t just steal the key off you.<p>Adding new secrets is also easy, I just scan the QR with the app, touch the key to the phone, give it a name and it&#x27;s added.<p>I&#x27;ve got around 12 TOTP secrets on there, works very well.",1400318292

It is not our feel-good notion of family. My brother in law has spent the last 15 years continuously working out of country as a truck driver in Singapore, living in a ramshackle shelter on construction sites while sending most of his earnings back to his wife and kids. This is a somewhat extreme case, but milder instances are commonplace. People often have to work away from their families for years at a time to make ends meet and accrue any sort of savings.<p>Then there is transportation. Every day you will see mothers on scooters carrying several toddlers who are certain to die in even minor accidents. Another common sight and a less egregious example would be pickup trucks with the backs piled full of day laborers, or commuters casually hanging off the back of high-speed songthaew busses.

3301807,comment,3300264,3300264,15,0,pshc,,,"While text editing interfaces could be more polished and modern--the underlying problem that causes your dissatisfaction is the text. Storing code as text is an evolutionary dead end. Storing code graphs in text requires the use of plaintext names for graph references, which binds logic and presentation together. The gap between the goal-completion logic a user comes up with and how they turn those mental instructions into plaintext is an unnecessary jump--an encoding--that produces no end of trivial but infuriating miscommunications.<p>Storing code as pure structure (not XML or anything silly, the serialization is trivial) avoids a huge class of artificial problems we've had to deal with since the dawn of compilers, due to the disconnect between human meaning encoded in plaintext and machine parsing.<p><i>Visualizing</i> code as text--text as the primary view in the MVC, complemented with colours and annotations and hyperlinks and hints--is extremely useful. What we really need is a structural editor with the familiarity and ease of use of a text editor. But that is a hard problem, and more polished text manipulators are a nice stop-gap in the meanwhile.",1322780149

Otherwise, they may be just pretending to be a rationalist when they really just believe whatever the mainstream believes.<p>These are his main examples:<p>> Personally, I think that Michael Shermer blew it by mocking  molecular nanotechnology, and Penn and Teller blew it by mocking cryonics ... Conversely, Richard Dawkins scooped up a huge truckload of actual-discriminating-skeptic points, at least in my book, for not making fun of the many-worlds interpretation when he was asked about in an interview;<p>The Dawkins example demonstrates his thesis very clearly. Dawkins is skeptical of a generally accepted theory (that the OP is also skeptical of) therefore the OP now considers him an ""actual-disciminating-skeptic"". However, his first two examples attempt to support the inverse of his thesis: if someone expresses a skeptical opinion that agrees with the mainstream, then they are not a ""good"" skeptic (""they blew it""). But that is a ridiculous claim that the OP himself dismisses in the first few paragraphs talking about how religion is no longer a good litmus test for skepticism. So, it seems like the OP is actually arguing that if a self professed skeptic expresses a mainstream skeptical opinion <i>that the OP disagrees with</i>, then they are not a ""good"" skeptic. Which is a bad, close-minded argument. The OP places himself in a ""rationalist"" tribe where dissenting opinions are no more tolerated than they are in the mainstream tribe.",1322779765

Other people who self-identify as rationalists may have other reasons.

But there's something else that bothers me about the rationalist tribe.<p>Why do people join it?  Why does someone self-identify as a rationalist?<p>For the most part people are rational within the framework they have that allows them to get by in the world.  Sure it's important to question beliefs to further the state of science, etc, but why is is it critical that any idea one holds be proven to the best of our abilities?  I don't understand why belief in god has to imply there is anything magic or supernatural; it just might be something we don't understand.  Certainly it seems possible that the universe exists within frameworks whose workings can never be fully understood from our current physical position.  The rationalist view seems to be to let the astrophysicists do their work, but don't you dare believe in something that is outside the realm of what they will eventually discover.<p>I understand religion has done a lot of awful things in the past, and so it deserves to be torn down as an institution, but most bad things are propagated by extremely rational actors out of greed and self-interest.  I don't see the harm in people believing in astrology or not being atheists, I'd rather see the rationalists take their arguments against the people who are actually doing major harm in the world (eg. profiting from massive environmental destruction).",1322778432

Committees and individual browser vendors are less likely to find the right designs and get them codified as well or as quickly.<p>This is not inevitable. You could have a righteous hacker/designer at a browser company, whose API and implementation are so winning they sweep all before them. Great if this happens, but it's rare in my experience.<p>Thus the apparent paradox of low-level APIs and increasingly very fast JS engines enabling faster and better hacker-community-based de-facto standardization than even the modern browser vendors can achieve on average.

It's also slower than some people want, but Flash was not built in a day, or a year, either.<p>Browser vendor ""defection"" (failure to cooperate in standards bodies on consensus standardization) is an ongoing threat.

Here is why:<p>Let's assume you have a cyphertext c, of length l (ie |c| = l). Now I take a plaintext p of length also l (|p| = l). Let the key k be c xor p. Now<p><pre><code>   c xor k = c xor (c xor p) = (c xor c) xor p = 0^l xor p = p\n</code></pre>\nWhere 0^l is a string of l zeros. So yeah, given one cyphertext, I can craft a pair of key and plaintext such that there is a cypher (simple xor) that, given the cyphertext and the key, outputs the plaintext.<p>What is worse? I can craft |E|^l of such plaintexts (where |E| is the size of the alphabet).<p>So yeah: this test only checks if people know basic cryptography and boolean algebra.

But I'd ask you to consider the other side as well.<p>Why do you think that businesses find it worthwhile to dump so much money into political contributions? I submit that the reason is because, as the government has assumed increasing amounts of power, it acquires the ability to confer significant advantages upon those favored by the law. So it's necessary for business to take extreme steps to ensure that they are, in fact, favored thusly.<p>In these terms, I think that a more constructive strategy for solving the problem isn't to attack political contributions (which is bound to get into thorny First Amendment questions), but to strike at the root by limiting the power that the government has to decide who is going to win and who is going to lose.<p>If we take away the government's power, then there's nothing for corporations to buy. If we give the government more power (to regulate the corporations' contributions and other matters), then there is an even greater incentive for the corporations to influence the goverenment -- which is exactly what we're trying to get away from.",1322777164

3301577,comment,3301436,3301436,6,0,mzbridget,,,"I've telecommuted on and off for years and I'm doing that right now. Here is what I learned:<p>1. Always ""get ready"" for work. Do the same routine as you would if you were going  to an office: shower, dressed, etc. It puts you in the mindset that its time for work.<p>2. Make it a point to work in a coffee shop or something similar at least once per week. You need to be around people as a human being and it breaks up your week nicely.<p>3. Make lunch or meeting arrangements with people in your field on a regular basis. Its similar to point #2 but takes it a step further in forcing you to communicate and interact with another person and its work-related.<p>4. Set very clear expectations with your family. Have a space that is designated only for work. Let them know that you're ""at work"" or they will bother you and you'll start resenting them.<p>5. Set a timeframe when you'll be off work. Let them know that they can expect say, between 5 and 6 pm and at that time you're off work. Period.<p>6. Never, ever do household chores during work hours unless you set a specific time during the day. For me, I don't allow any chores but there are times when I will set aside an hour and complete a task. The joy of working from home is flexibility so use it but wisely. The same goes for work. Don't allow 'creep' to set in because it can be a slippery slope. When you're off work - be off work. When you're at work - work.<p>Good luck!",1322776954

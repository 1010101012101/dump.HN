Different knowledge base, different goals, basically.<p>I agree with the first point of setting a clear goal so you know what you are actually trying to accomplish.<p>Also, learn about statistics. Most folks make logical errors when they &quot;bet.&quot; Flipping a coin, the odds are always about 50/50, no matter what the last flip or last ten flips were. But people tend to think &quot;The last three were heads, so we are overdue for tails.&quot; Nope. It is still about 50/50 (with, I think, a slight skew towards heads).<p>Get the facts or hard data. Be very skeptical about data that comes from iffy sources or processes. Trying to decide on hazy info sucks so bad. Good info leads to better decisions. &quot;Garbage in, garbage out.&quot;<p>Get a sounding board, preferably one who has different strengths and weaknesses from you, not a &quot;yes man&quot; and not someone biased in the same way you are. My oldest son is very opposite me in some important ways.

The reason why it looks &quot;flat&quot; is because when you go to &quot;count&quot; the website scales both curves the same y-axis.  I think you mean to say something like &quot;kurtosis&quot; - which is, if anything, obscured to the eye by the process of flattening by scaling.<p>And math is not a good idea when you make assumptions like normality of curves which are absolutely not normal.

Statistical tests for randomness are still very valid and very important for PRNGs, and your dismissal of them is premature. Three million zeroes is so wildly improbable that any PRNG that for a reasonable seed value would produce such a sequence would be intensely scrutinized to determine if other seeds exhibited such behavior. If Dual_EC_DRBG exhibited that behavior, the cryptographic community&#x27;s reaction would be swift.<p>The issue here is the <i>entropy</i> of such a sequence is extremely low, and while low entropy PRNGs do exist, and they are <i>not</i> considered good for cryptographic purposes. If algorithmic weaknesses led to long stable and highly compressible sequences, or rather, sequences with a very low entropy (as measured by say, Kolmogorov complexity) would be considered suspect.<p>Determining Kolmogorov complexity is itself a difficult problem, it&#x27;s the problem of finding the shortest program (in a theoretical computer science sense) that produces a given output.

We tried to keep this new feature as close to the SMS API you already know and love as possible - for inbound there are just four new params (NumMedia, MediaUrln, MediaContentType and the new unique identifier MessageSid) and for outbound just one new param MediaUrl.<p>You send / receive your photos - we make it work for whomever is sending or receiving.

Not a big deal in itself, but every subtle signal tells others that you are solid, and down to business.  If you are worried about seeming too pretentious, if someone makes a comment about your pen, just casually mention that they are making a comeback, or something about it not being expensive.  For example, some of the lower end Parker ones (Jotter, Frontier, Urban) are around the $20 mark.<p>Other things that send signals, include the way you dress (don&#x27;t have to wear a tux everywhere you go, but wear clothes that fit, and have a sturdy look to them).  Also it is helpful to work on your speaking skills, so that you speak with inflection and purpose.  For example, listen to the difference between a radio host, and call in listeners.",1379532867

(And yes, &quot;?pretty_print=1&quot; is another option, but of course this has its own set of obvious tradeoffs.)<p>You seem to think that a <1% hit on (uncompressed) response size doesn&#x27;t outweigh the benefits of such a design choice. But the problem is you&#x27;re not expressing this as an opinion but as a fact. There are plenty of scenarios (I&#x27;d argue the majority) where a tiny increase in the % of bytes you transfer is worth making it so developers can easily debug your API. Particularly when you are an API-providing startup with a few people and minimizing support-side touch points is crucial to scaling.",1379531112

Sometimes few, othertimes dozen, and few times we were like 40-50 kids gathered from group ages from 1st to 8 or 9th grade playing together (bullying was all the time there I guess, I&#x27;ve never noticed it seriously - it wasn&#x27;t an open concept, neither taboo - more like unknown thing - that just happens and you deal with it. It&#x27;s different now that you know it, and have a child on your own, and live in USA - like me).<p>As kids, often we would go to the nearest construction site (usually high-rise building in construction) and do stupid things. It was the norm to fight with sticks - plastic or wood, throw stones, rocks at each other - and almost everyday come with blood here and there (no big deal, I survived).<p>My biggest adventure by far was, when me and my one year older cousin (he was 6 or 7 then) took the road to walk from one city (Chernomoretz, Bulgaria) to another (Burgas) - here is the route on google maps - <a href=""http://goo.gl/EfRMsK"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/EfRMsK</a> - It&#x27;s 26km - and we walked, took some bus, did a lot of stupid things (bent signs, ate stuff that we should not do). But overall had pretty good time. We started off like 8:00-9:00AM in the morning, and showed up at my grandparents apartment somewhere in afternoon. It was all because I thought we need an important plastic truck which was there.<p>Then with my other grandma we went couple of times to her village in the summer, and there I would roam the village, river, forest ( <a href=""http://goo.gl/8HyhbQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/8HyhbQ</a> ) - and come back late at night, sometimes 10:00pm, sometimes 2:00am - and I was 2nd or 3rd grade.<p>I guess she was afraid, but one thing she knew, or kind of expected it - is that other people if told that I&#x27;m lost would look for me, scorn me if they had to.<p>In short: I had respect of everyone bigger than me, and everyone else too. The situation in USA currently is that the first time you open your mouth against some kid to scorn him, and you might end up in prison. And that might be the right thing to do... But it&#x27;s very unhelpful, since the kids no longer respect you.<p>It&#x27;s quite different now with our son (soon to be 6) - he grows much faster than me emotionally, intellectually - he asks things that I would&#x27;ve asked much later in my kids&#x27; life. On top of that he&#x27;s supposed to start his real life working much older than me (if he&#x27;s willing to finish uni/ etc.)<p>Got the &quot;Dangerous book for Boys&quot; and would seen read it to him.

The weirdest thing for me though was that as a toddler, I was extremely social and friendly.  Then through a series of occurrences I ended up on the other end of the spectrum.  My family moved all the time and I barely ever had any friends.  I was happiest when reading. I read incessantly, constantly - often hiding in the bathroom to read because my mom wanted me to do school work. Haha.<p>It was strange though because I read fiction exclusively.  It was a way for me to find friends, even though fake ones.<p>I left home in grade 11 (Junior year of high school) for a boarding school.  I was super excited to make hundreds of friends now that I was finally going to be among more people my age, living with them.  It turned out to be a disaster.  I had always wanted friends but I had never learned to socialize.  It was a hard 2 years of rejection, pranks, people constantly laughing at me.  In a high end school in Delhi girls who don&#x27;t know how to dress, do their hair, take care of themselves, are BIG jokes. :-/  To be fair, I was not smoothest operator aside from that either.<p>After that I got into Stanford for college and that was probably the biggest blessing I got.  Suddenly I was around people who were more like me.  Yay!  But I faked a lot to fit in and be &quot;normal&quot;.  I tried really hard to be interesting.  I still only managed to make a few friends but I wasn&#x27;t a pariah.<p>Then desire struck.  I decided I wanted to fulfill my dream of being a &quot;leader&quot; and ran for student government.  That was one of the times in my life that I faked it till I made it.  I was the friendliest, best looking self I have ever been.  As I was going through the election campaign, I wondering if this faking was worth it.<p>I didn&#x27;t really realize then but that experience changed me forever.  The faking stopped feeling fake.  I now feel much more empathetic and social with people.  Similar to the person who commented below about running a bar to change his behavior and comfort level, its almost like I needed practice to civilize myself haha.<p>Anyway, in summary, I feel like faking is shitty when you are going through it but can have really good long term behavior changes.

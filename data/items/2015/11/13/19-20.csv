I personally think the reason is because it is relatively easy to build a product. But it is incredibly difficult to build a business around a product. It is very difficult to get traction and you have to really focus on and refine your product. So you have a startup who&#x27;s concept is to crank out product after product, and then just throw them into the wind, hoping something will take off. Even businesses with one amazing product don&#x27;t take off that way. A huge corporation can afford an R&D lab where 1 out of 1000 products might take off. (You might even say ycombinator is such a concept) A startup with a little bit of funding cannot afford to crank out dud after dud. They&#x27;re betting that they will hit the jackpot after, say, 5 or 10 products, depending on the amount of runway they have.<p>Then again, there&#x27;s a lot of businesses that were successful because they found the magic sauce that all of their predecessors were unable to find. If you think you&#x27;ve found it, then definitely go for it!

You can find it well-described at <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/forfeiture"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/forfeiture</a>.<p>But my description of how it actually happens is still valid.  See <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/30/why-the-tsa-posted-a-photo-of-cash-filled-luggage-on-twitter/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/30/why-t...</a> for a recent case where exactly this happened.  And it links to 3 other cases where money was seized from travelers, with no criminal charge ever being filed against anyone.  In all 4 of these cases a person tried to board a plane, TSA finds money, seizes it, sues the money, and no case is made against the person.  In none of the cases did the person get said money back.  (The main conflict over where it goes in most cases is that a couple of dozen different government agencies argue about how to divide it up.)<p>The most unusual trait connecting these cases is that there was publicity about it.  It happens so often that reporters usually don&#x27;t bother to write about them.<p>The problem is that legal standard is that the government merely has to establish &quot;reasonable suspicion that there was a crime&quot;, while the person has to establish &quot;a preponderance of evidence that there was not&quot;.  This reverses &quot;innocent until proven guilty.&quot;  How do you establish a preponderance of evidence that no crime happened when no specific crime was ever alleged?  It is effectively impossible.<p>This story from a year ago on the front page establishes the shift in standards quite well: <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2014/02/civil-liberties-and-supreme-court?foo=bar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2014/02/ci...</a>.  A quick summary is that a couple was indicted of a crime and successfully defended themselves.  In the process the government seized a home through civil forfeiture, and the forfeiture stood because the couple was unable to prove that the crime did not happen.<p>(Unlike the cases that I&#x27;m describing above, in this case a specific crime was alleged.  Normally the TSA just claims something like, &quot;there was a smell of marijuana&quot; and you have no way to prove that there wasn&#x27;t.)",1447444059

There is a place for higher education - [...] - but it cannot be expected to be the sole gateway to the middle class.</i><p>Unfortunately, your apprenticeship idea does not address a key driver of why college institutions act as gatekeepers of desirable employers.  It&#x27;s not so much the &quot;training&quot; but more of the &quot;signaling&quot;.[1]<p>As a thought experiment, let&#x27;s pretend that the USA de-emphasizes college and promotes apprenticeships.  The USA has roughly 3 million high school graduates every year.  It&#x27;s safe to say that most of them are not really interested in college purely for the &quot;skills&quot;, or &quot;well-rounded education&quot; including Shakespeare and Calculus III.  They&#x27;d rather just earn a middle-income salary right away and college is just that &quot;hoop to jump through&quot; to make it happen.<p>Well, businesses like Google, Ford Motor, Goldman Sachs, etc are not going to be interested in dealing directly with a vast sea of undifferentiated high school graduates to offer internships.  They need a pre-selection process.  Therefore, a new &quot;clearinghouse&quot; institution would naturally emerge in the marketplace to &quot;evaluate&quot; (test) and &quot;filter&quot; (rank) these hopeful apprentices.  (Perhaps Donald Trump could create a spinoff business to do just that.)<p>Once the clearinghouse is in place, the hopeful candidates will want to demonstrate &quot;talent/smarts/whatever&quot; so they get the best internship offers.  That will then lead to tutoring, coaching, preparation, etc and <i>all those services cost money</i>.<p>Because of how humans work, we&#x27;d just be replacing variable $FILTER=&quot;college&quot; with $FILTER=&quot;clearinghouse+coaching&quot;.  That new model may cost less overall to society because C+C doesn&#x27;t spend 4 months dissecting Shakespeare but let&#x27;s not kid ourselves that this new model is &quot;more fair&quot;.  A future complaint would be, <i>&quot;I took out a $20k to pay for clearinghouse coaching but instead of landing a coveted apprenticeship slot at Google Inc, I&#x27;m a barista at Starbucks.  It sucks because The Whole Point of the apprenticeship system is to TRAIN me!&quot;</i><p>You see, the core problem remains because companies don&#x27;t want to &quot;waste internship training&quot; on poor candidates.  Everybody wants the best of the best and apprenticeships don&#x27;t fundamentally change that human desire.<p>[1]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)</a>",1447443293

Our dorms at UT Austin were nearly as much as rent nearby, and while rent was barely cheaper if you commute, there&#x27;s the added cost of having to use a car. Regardless of commuter status, you&#x27;ll need a car to get to work in most cities in this country, and if you stay on campus, the parking passes make up for the savings you had living in a dorm. Luckily our yearly tuition was &quot;only&quot; 7-8.5k per year throughout my education -- yes, it increased by 15% through my stay, which nothing compared to the rent increases caused by West Coast migrants driving up prices. Now that I&#x27;m in a &quot;real city&quot;, the cost of tuition every is <i>at least</i> five times the amount I used to pay, and don&#x27;t get me started on the other costs.<p>I was very fortunate in how quickly I was able to pay off my debt, but anyone who graduates without debt in the US today is either getting a lot of outside help or outright lying about how much help they&#x27;re getting.",1447442876

From Bennis v. Michigan (which you mentioned in another thread):<p>&quot;On the Government&#x27;s appeal from the Circuit Court&#x27;s acquittal of the vessel, it was contended by the owner that the vessel could not be forfeited until he was convicted for the privateering. The Court rejected this contention, explaining: &quot;The thing is here primarily considered as the offender, or rather the offence is attached primarily to the thing.&quot; Id., at 14. In another admiralty forfeiture decision 17 years later, Justice Story wrote for the Court that in in rem admiralty proceedings &quot;the acts of the master and crew . . . bind the interest of the owner of the ship, whether he be innocent or guilty; and he impliedly submits to whatever the law denounces as a forfeiture attached to the ship by reason of their unlawful or wanton wrongs.&quot; Harmony v.

I think it&#x27;s fair to say that someone who makes a fortune using illegal means should have to surrender that fortune.<p>Where asset forfeiture falls down on this is that FAR too often, no illegal acts are proven before forfeiture is initiated, and substantive due process should need to be the hurdle before that happens.  This will of course lead to the unfortunate likelihood that &quot;bad people&quot; will use some of those fortunes in their legal defenses, but if &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; is to be our standard, and it&#x27;s a mighty good one IMHO, then so be it.  The alternative is much worse (again, IMHO), which is that those without fortunes, and hence, without the means of adequate legal representation, are simply unable to defend themselves at all except through court-appointed lawyers of potentially questionable effectiveness.<p>The trick, of course, is that the state has a hurdle before stealing goods, and they have no incentive to impose such hurdles upon themselves.  I don&#x27;t know what the fix for that is, short of being really loud and riotous, but someone else&#x27;s off-the-cuff remark the other day struck a chord to me (though not without its own potential pitfalls) -- limit attorneys general and other positions of that sort to only defense and criminal attorneys with a history of having defended the rights of citizens.<p>If we accept that the job (or at least <i>a</i> job) of the government is to defend the rights of the citizenry, then such an exclusion makes a certain amount of sense.

The following year a state-backed tuna-fishing venture in Mozambique, a country even poorer than Zambia, was able to raise $850m at an interest rate of 8.5%.</i><p>Now data from the IMF is showing that corporations and governments were probably not investing these loans into profitable activities:<p><i>Growing debt in emerging markets is not of itself something to worry about. It may be that savings are getting into local capital markets more effectively or that there are more, better investment opportunities. Sadly, those happy possibilities do not seem to account for what is now going on. While corporate leverage in emerging markets has been going up, corporate profitability there has fallen, says the IMF. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that rapid debt build-ups are the hallmarks of periods of indiscriminate lending that eventually end in tears.</i><p>So this article has little to do with the average American consumer. It&#x27;s about banks looking for higher rates of returns in riskier markets and doing dumb things with their money. If they have not sufficiently calculated and priced out these risks, which is what happened in 2007 (purposefully), then a lot of this debt might start defaulting, which could lead to another financial contraction as banks find themselves yet again with risky, misvalued assets on their balance sheets, eating up an unsustainable portion of their portfolios and limiting their ability to lend.<p>The difference is that screwing up corporate lending might not be as damaging as fudging consumer lending, such as mispriced and unsecured mortgages.

Ideas that got traction were &quot;green-lit&quot;, which basically meant that the Assembly company would provide resources for it like hosting, DNS, email services, git repositories, etc., etc.<p>Apps that were greenlit could create bounties for work that needed to be performed, and any member of the community could collect on those bounties.  Need design work like logos and icons?  A designer (or many designers) could grab the work and submit their entries.  Each unit of work would be awarded a pre-determined amount, and those payments amounted to a blockchain allocation -- e.g., submitting a logo might be worth 100 points, while submitting the accepted logo might be worth 1,000 points.  That 1,000 points equated to ownership. If there were 10,000 points awarded to date, your 1,000 points were worth 10% ownership.<p>If the product was developed, completed, marketed, etc., and turned a profit, Assembly would collect a rake to cover expenses, and all the profits were paid out based on allocation.<p>It was a good system, really, and resulted in some pretty neat projects.  That said, I&#x27;m not surprised to see it being shuttered.  A while back they pivoted most of their tools into being some kind of community changelog, and as a fairly active participant, I literally stopped using it after that, as I had no idea how to use it, saw no instructions, and all the chatrooms that had existed previously had been shuttered in favor of the changelog.<p>I assume, but have no inside knowledge, that between participation dropoff, and the other end -- that many projects were either never completed, never marketed, never got traction, or not really good, they were outlaying too much and getting too little success on the other end.<p>For a (probably) better description of what they were, this article is handy: \n<a href=""http://tech.co/assembly-basically-group-projects-adults-2015-03"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.co/assembly-basically-group-projects-adults-2015...</a>",1447441592

When I say &quot;powerful&quot;, the first thing that comes to mind is its ongoing reflection evolution. TypeTags give us access to class information in a functional manner (by passing in an implicit type info object) that we can take advantage of using Scala&#x27;s (also powerful) matching mechanism.<p>The second thing that comes to mind is the ability to support variance. To quote Twitter Scala School: &quot;A central question that comes up when mixing OO with polymorphism is: if T’ is a subclass of T, is Container[T’] considered a subclass of Container[T]?&quot; Scala allows us to express this information using +/- as in `Container[+D]` allows for subclasses of `D`.<p>Finally, though not so much related, an interesting development in the type space is type macros (<a href=""http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/typemacros.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/typemacros.html</a>). This will give us a stronger &quot;generic&quot; approach to programming that allows us to write code to construct type hierarchies. In general, Scala is moving fast and always evolving.<p>You&#x27;d have to be more specific as to what your problems are concerning boxing & jvm. Lists are properly specialized such that a = List(1) == List<Int> and a(0) == Int. Of course, if you use a diverse set of types in the list, you&#x27;ll have a `List<Any>` which then you would use `match` like so...\nmatch item {\n  case i:Int => println(&quot;int &quot; + i)\n  case s:String => println(&quot;string &quot; + s)\n}",1447441298

I don&#x27;t think that is the case - if there were, those people would start taking those jobs at the lower pay.<p>Since this isn&#x27;t the case, imagine what you say starts happening - those companies with openings raise the pay enough to find a candidate.

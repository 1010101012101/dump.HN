6544146,comment,6543080,6543879,8,0,goggles99,,,"You clearly have never used an MVNO(Reseller)<p>I just went to Verizon and chose a free SmartPhone (Droid 4) with a 500MB data plan.
It was $80/mo 2 yr contract<p>I can buy that phone outright (brand new) for $300.<p>If I go to PagePlus (Verizon MVNO) and sign up for their $1200 Minute, $3000 Text/MMS 500MB $30/mo plan here is what I paid after two years.<p>Verizon - $80 * 24 = $1,920<p>PagePlus - $30 * 24 + $300 (phone) + $50 roaming (average usage cost for 2 yrs) = $1,020<p>And what did I get for my $900 difference? (That is $37.50/mo BTW) A big &quot;Verizon&quot; label on my phone, and a two year contract.<p>You could get two plans and phones from PagePlus and still pay less.<p>I realize that there are other factors like level of customer service, and no roaming charges that VZW and ATT die-hards will tell you about. Well, in my experience, the service is no better and most people almost never use roaming service while using a Verizon MVNO. I would say that i have only spent around $20 in the last two years from roaming.<p>Other factiods:
Have Verizon or ATT and want to change your plan options (Minutes, Data amount ETC)? Sure - that will require a new two year contract. Don&#x27;t want a new phone. Well you will still be paying the same regardless. Break the contract and you will still pay the same penalty. This seems to refute your claim that you are just paying back a subsidy.<p>Want a new phone with your new contract? OK, choose a &quot;free&quot; one from a list whose retail prices have a $150-$200 difference in price. Are you going to pay less per month if you opt for the cheaper (3g) free one? If your statement was true you should.",1381697959

Apparently they&#x27;ve even finally implemented authentication using SMP challenges, which was a major usability issue compared to traditional OTR clients. Until very recently, the only way to be sure someone wasn&#x27;t running a man in the middle attack was to manually compare key hashes over an authenticated channel (and you had to do this every session at one point). The OTR developers had already discovered years earlier that this was enough of a pain that most people didn&#x27;t bother and developed a more user-friendly alternative, but sadly it involved some fairly exotic crypto that the Cryptocat developers took an age to implement.",1381696744

It feels very much like Lisp done rightwhich is to say that its very practical, and you get much more composability and metaprogramming power without all the parentheses.<p>Joy[3] was the first language to be described as concatenative, invented by the late Manfred von Thun; its operation is defined as a term rewriting system, but it can be implemented using a stack. If you want some theoretical background, Brent Kirbys Theory of Concatenative Combinators[4] may be enlightening. Cat[5] was the first statically typed concatenative language, and Kitten is my successor to Cat.<p>If youre looking at Rust, Kitten[6][7] is designed with similar goals in mind. Its a language about safe, expressive abstractions with predictable, low runtime costs. It encourages expressing programs as compositions of effects. It is not usable for production but may be fun to play around with; we are currently working on a native backend.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://concatenative.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://concatenative.org</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://factorcode.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://factorcode.org/</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.kevinalbrecht.com/code/joy-mirror/joy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kevinalbrecht.com/code/joy-mirror/joy.html</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://tunes.org/~iepos/joy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tunes.org/~iepos/joy.html</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://cat-language.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cat-language.com/</a><p>[6]: <a href=""http://kittenlang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kittenlang.org/</a><p>[7]: <a href=""https://github.com/evincarofautumn/kitten"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/evincarofautumn/kitten</a>",1381696563

On the upside, the F# community has grown quite a lot in the last year; there&#x27;s even an official F# Foundation now: <a href=""http://fsharp.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fsharp.org</a><p>I ended up working with F# through my previous job; I founded a startup whose product as a .NET -> GPU JIT compiler. The idea was similar to what Xamarin is doing now with their C# (and now F#!) tools for building iOS and Android apps, in that we aimed to make GPU programming accessible to the everyday programmer.<p>I wrote the first version of our product in C#; it was around 30KLoC, still missing quite a lot of functionality, and buggier than I was really happy with. I&#x27;d heard that F# was based on ML, and that ML was designed for work like building compilers and theorem provers, so I decided to take the plunge and learn it. It was a little difficult to wrap my head around at first, but I stuck to it, and I ported+simplified our original C# codebase to F# within a couple of months, ending up with ~5KLoC and a new version of our product which was much faster, had fewer bugs, and overall easier to maintain than before. It sounds a little cheesy, but making the jump to F# and putting in the effort to learn it <i>really</i> well was one of the best career decisions I&#x27;ve ever made, and I haven&#x27;t regretted it for a second.

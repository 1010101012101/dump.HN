They're definitely on the ""extend"" phase of embrace, extend, extinguish. They're creating their own little insular community.  Search results return Google+ results first and prominently at the top. Their browser has features that no other browser supports (native client, Dart etc).  Their previously free APIs are now going to cost lots and lots of money (Maps).  None of these things are bad in and of themselves, and all of it is certainly their choice.  However, if this is the direction they're headed then I want no part of it.<p>Edit: For those of you who find my comment off topic - did you even read the article or just the summary?  Here are some relevant quotes:<p>""Twitter had criticized Googles new social search feature, which it calls Search plus Your World, on Tuesday. As weve seen time and time again, news breaks first on Twitter, its statement said. Were concerned that as a result of Googles changes, finding this information will be much harder for everyone.""<p>""Sullivan told Schmidt he thought one feature of Search plus Your World, which recommends relevant people to follow on Google+ but not other networks, is the equivalent of saying hey, you can only find information about finance on Google finance. You cannot find information about finance anywhere else.""<p>Clearly people are upset about Google trying to block out competitor's results.  I believe my comment is completely ON topic.<p>Edit 2: Wow, I had no idea how many Google apologists were out there.  I had high hopes that the Hacker News community might actually be objective and not just fawn all over Google.  Christ was I mistaken.",1326380006
3456484,story,,,1,0,digitalengineer,"Hacking of Human Waste",,"Medical waste is extremely expensive to process. It contains blood, urine, needles and all the things no-one wants to think about. (Including all sorts of nasty diseases, viruses and bacteria). Until now hospitals paid a great deal of money for specialized transport and destruction of this waste. No more! I hope this will soon be a thing of the past.<p>Two Dutch guys hacked together a 'dishwasher-size' machine (called theLAGX) to transform dangerous and expensive hospital waste into regular standard waste. ""So what?"", you might say? Well... special medical waste is about a hundred (or more) times more expensive than ""regular"" waste!<p>I've been reading HN for quite some time and never really found anything ""worthy"" of posting. Until now! Last night a family member told me everything about a new (and very disruptive) invention he created and a problem with investors he faced. When he was done explaining I just knew the good readers of Hacker News can come up with some good advice to help him find investors and scale up.<p>Their LAGX machine uses new (and patented) techniquesto separate and disinfect hospital waste so thoroughly that a hospital can literally save millions on their waste-bills. In fact, it's so easy to use, hospital-staff can set it up in their regular workflow immediately. It's hooked up on the internet so both the hospital staff and the LAGX-HQ can keep a close eye or remotely control the machine at all times.<p>When the LAGX machine is done, medical waste likeinfusion bags and needles, blood and urine bags and almost all medical accessories are transformed into regularand sterilized waste. It can all be chucked in to a normal waste bin. Even the fluids are so thoroughly disinfected they can be disposed of in the sewer. (Saving a lot of weight on the waste-bill).<p>With theLAGX machine, hospitals can reduce their garbage-bill and <i></i><i>save a ton of money</i><i></i>. And there's more:The LAGX machine was specifically developed to let the separation and sterilization process take place at the source,so nocontamination-risk during transport.No longer are garbage trucks forced to drive around town from hospital to hospital with extremely dangerous biohazard waste.<p>The guys made sure they patented the LAGX. It was tested and approved byBiotec GMBH Germany ( www.biotec-gmbh.com ) and the LAGX also holds the 2011 TNO/KEMA certificate for medical appliances. The very first LAGX was placed a month ago at a large medical lab at the city of Utrecht (The Netherlands). <p>The LAGX is ready to take on the world. Both guys have been so absolutely focussed about finishing their first machine, the patents and getting it approved, they have absolutely missed the boat on the investors-side of the equation. They've spend loads and loads of money and time they could really use some Hard Core Hacker News Readers' advice with regards to finding and presenting to investors.<p>My dear Hacker News Readers: I'd love to see hospitals all over the world save tons of money on their Biohazard Garbage Bills, and see the LAGX take over the world. But where to start? Both guys are running out of money and I'd hate to see the machine end up in a basement unused.<p>We can show my hacking family-member the brain-power of Hacker News and give them some advice on how to find investors or otherwise help launch their new company.

3456467,comment,3455744,3455744,6,0,akavel,,,"I have some issues with this whole affair at the moment:<p>Firstly, in the linked article we can read: ""even cheaper computer [...] and it's being sold in China for $7."" Uhm? On the original Rhombus Tech page, it seems that the Allwinner A10 is just the <i>CPU</i> which is going to be used in the computer, and it's the <i>CPU</i> which they claim is sold at $7. So, the computer's sure gonna be more expensive than that. Also, this sentence suggests, that the computer is already built and being sold. Which is not the case, and this brings us to the next point...<p>Secondly, from the original Rhombus Tech page, all I can read now (please, show me that I'm wrong) is that the computer is only <i>being designed</i> now. On 15 Dec 2011 all they had (at least according to what is reported publicly on their page) was apparently a rough concept .png collage of overall layout of elements, and contact to some Factory in Shenzen, China. And they immediately started taking preorders! As of Jan 2012, they seem to be only selecting components they maybe could place on the PCB, and designing parts of the circuit in KiCAD.<p>Now, to contrast with Rhombus Tech, Raspberry Pi didn't <i>ever</i> take preorders (they specifically rejected such requests), and already had working and demoable prototypes (with loads of hardware and software concerns solved) several <i>months</i> ago. And they still needed corrections, polishing of the design etc. As much as I'd love to see a computer close to $15, RasPi's process sounds much more trustworthy to me than Rhombus Tech's. Ok, I understand Rhombus may need preorders, as they are probably not so solidly money-backed as RasPi's owner, but for me they're clearly in a much higher risk group.",1326379746

Allwinner has already reduced the price to $5. The A10 is very successful in China because it offers the best performance and power optimisations in this price range.<p>At $25 Raspberry Pi is a joke. If it actually sees a decent amount of sales, you will be sure to see actual companies that specialise in this field competing at lower prices and better performance. Raspberry Pi has realised something that everyone in the industry knows: computing is cheap. It will not take long for the competition to crush Raspberry Pi if there is a large enough market for what they are doing. As for now they are chasing after the tablet market and IMHO are going to do well.",1326378077

When the web started out, the amount of stuff was small and it was possible to keep track of the site you needed to know about. Then the web grew and people tried to manually organize it (ala early Yahoo). Then the web grew more and search became the best way to find something.<p>The same kind of thing happened with personal computers. In the early days there was limited storage and a single folder worked fine. Then storage got cheaper and hierarchical directories were added and that worked for a while. Now there tends to be so much stuff on your computer that it is often easier and faster to just search for it.<p>I think the same thing is happening on the web. As the amount of stuff we have on the web grows - especially stuff that is private or shared with a select group of people - the need to effectively search it will grow.",1326377404

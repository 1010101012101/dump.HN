4950740,comment,4950623,4950623,12,0,notJim,,,"The HATEOAS wonks are crazy, IMO. Most people who consume your API will have no idea what HATEOAS is and they sure as hell won't care. What will they care about? The URL to hit to get the data they want. They will hardcode that URL in their app, too, so expect any changes to it to require a great deal of fanfare to re-educate your users.<p>In theory, the URN solution could work, but it's far more complex and requires more maintenance than simply having URLs that can be relied upon. His solution to the problem of breaking bookmarks is also a lot of work for consumers of his API--they have to two codepaths: one for when the URL works like it should, and another for when it changes and they have to use hypermedia to find it again. Again, most consumers of the API aren't going to give a shit. They are going to hardcode URLs and complain when you break them.<p>Not only that, but consider the implications of an API that requires you to start from the beginning each time for mobile traffic. Each request over a mobile connection takes an eternity due to high latency. You're seriously telling me that you want to force users of your API to make N * depth of resource requests, instead of just going straight there, when each request takes 100 ms or more? Okay, so maybe you can cache it, but that just means the user's first impression of the app is that it takes 500 ms just to do the first thing. Pretty shitty first impression.<p>The comparison to a browser doesn't hold much water for me either. Users (and search engines) will save your URLs, so if you break them, you will lose traffic. If I try to go to my bookmark and get a 404, you really think I'm going to take the time to find your page again? Maybe, but it's much more likely I'm going to shake my head and close the tab. Of course Google will eventually find your page again, but it will have lost the SEO points it gained, which means you'll have to start rebuilding your SEO from scratch.<p>The other issue with the browse as hypermedia engine that he leaves out is the human brain. The human brain is excellent at extracting information from text data, so there doesn't need to be any kind of common standard or format to browse a webpage. The brain just figures it out that when you say click: [here], [here] is a link that goes to whatever you were just talking about. That dramatically reduces the burden on webpage authors to conform to any kind format. His theoretical (well, implementations certainly exist) universal REST client only works when every API you want to consume standardizes to presenting the information in the same format.<p>I drank the HATEOAS Kool-Aid when I first learned about REST too, and then I built a beautiful API that used it. What did the developers ask for? A list of URLs.<p>The future is almost never $elegantly_designed_complex_system. It's almost always a pile of garbage, with a few humans sitting around sorting through the garbage to find the thing they want.",1356047688

I did not say that you, jeremyarussell, or any specific person taken ""per se"" needs a higher thingie to stop him/her from committing any crimes, it's just that for example the 20th century has been marked by some of the most heinous crimes in our existence as a species while in the same time only a small percentage of our fellow humans are psychopathic or sociopaths or however else you want to call those who commit crimes for pleasure only. Somehow, to make up for the difference (in the ""people killed vs. natural-born-killers"" ratio), I believe that we have somehow to look deeper into ourselves.

But if you happen to know (like for example I do) that tens of thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of Romanian Jews (Romania being the country where I grew up and currently live in) were carried in trains to their final destination to close-by Transnistria (<a href=""http://isurvived.org/Transnistria.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://isurvived.org/Transnistria.html</a>) then you begin to see things differently.<p>It took my country's Government close to 60 years to finally starting to acknowledge that we actually did exterminate people in Transnistria.

In fact, if I were to take the tramway to work tomorrow instead of the metro I would pass right by the said church (no statue of him now), which Antonescu actually helped build (the church, that is).

But I'm always disappointing to see people do so before raising their concerns and making their arguments. It would avoid the repetition of errors and discussions that have been addressed previously. We could also work together to adapt HTML5 Boilerplate if there is a good case to do so.<p>Once-upon-a-time, I didn't appreciate the work and community knowledge that went into HTML5 Boilerplate. However, after I started to open issues against the repo and contribute to the project, I realised that it has always been <i>very</i> open to contributions and changes of direction. I had significantly underestimated how much thought and combined knowledge was going into the project, and how much it was constantly evolving.<p>It's hard to design a useful starting template that's clear and friendly enough for newcomers, documented enough for explorers, and svelte enough for experienced developers. We're always trying to figure out the best way to present the value of the project while not scaring away too many people. Hopefully, we're doing a decent job of balancing those concerns and making people feel welcome in the discussions.<p>I hope that developers will continue to work <i>with</i> -- and look to join -- the people developing HTML5 Boilerplate at any given time. If you think something is missing or should be removed, make the case for it. We listen and learn; we're constantly evolving the project.<p>Thanks<p>------<p>> HTML5 BP is maintained by Google people.\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4949018"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4949018</a><p>That's not true.

Your balance will decrease monthly if you make your normal payments.  Just mentioning that for sake of clarity -- some smart people I know don't necessarily have a lot of personal finance knowledge.  Your loans will only grow if you either default on them or do something like triggering one of the income-contingent payment plans (which are a <i>lot</i> less good of an idea than people usually think, BTW).<p>Unsolicited financial advice: go to the institution you deposit your paychecks in and ask about consolidating student loans.

4950579,comment,4949289,4950321,1,0,mattmaroon,,,"I'll give it a whack.<p>First off, I'm defining ""good food"" rather strictly. Something you'd see in a chef-owned restaurant, where the chef either went to culinary school or worked in prestigious restaurants. (Cooking, like programming, can be learned without school.) I'm not saying they have to have a Michelin star, but they have to be making a real effort to make good food, so not Olive Garden. Most of the people who disagree with me simply don't like my definition of good food (and perhaps find it snobbish) which is totally fine.<p>So imagine you took a list of everything on those menus, and started filtering out anything using a technique a rice cooker is incapable of. I suppose my statement might not be literally true, there might still be SOMETHING left on the list, but we'd be talking less than a percent.<p>There are a number of things you just can't do (I think) in a rice cooker that you do at least one of in pretty much every dish you'd see at such a restaurant. You can't cook something at more than one temperature, for instance. You can't cook at any temperature above or below 100 celsius. You can't get a Maillard reaction (the browning of a steak or toast and it's associated flavors) or caramelization to happen. Right there you've knocked out almost everything cooked that you'll see on such a menu.<p>You can't roast or sear or sautee anything. A rice cooker cooks only with conduction in a wet environment. (I'm assuming convection occurs too when there's still enough liquid in the pot.) It's too hot to simmer and too cold to braise.<p>Even one pot dishes (and anything that isn't a one pot dish, which is the vast majority of the food I've described, is out by definition unless you have numerous rice cookers) usually take multiple steps. For instance toss the chicken in to brown, remove, sweat some onions, toss in some peppers, put in some plum tomatoes and white wine, raise the heat a little to deglaze and burn off the alcohol, lower the heat, add the chicken back in, braise. Etc. (Season the chicken with salt and a little piment d'esplette in the beginning and you've got poulet basquaise! You're welcome HN.)<p>So what can you do in a rice cooker? Boil stuff, that's it. You rarely in any decent restaurant will be served something that has had nothing done to it but boiling, in fact, I can't think of anything and like I said, I'm a foodie. I travel around a lot and have been to a lot of restaurants.",1356044424

They will see the use of the tool then, and when the team accepts it they will hopefully get an official server to host it on.<p>Write tests for your code, and when other devs work with you on issues, or break things, write tests and send to them ""Hey, i wrote this test that shows the code you wrote is failing, can you make it pass?"" Also ask others to make unit tests. You will have to write the bulk of tests. You probably know which others on the team are open to writing tests and working with you on the pocket of excellence. Get them involved first, and then the idea will spread. A good idea would be buy them copies of Pragmatic Programmer too.<p>No, you aren't process oriented. A software team that doesn't at least like the idea of automated builds, and tests is crazy. As far as if it's a good place to work and improve one's skills? That depends. In some teams you might never get them to adopt the pocket of excellence. If you are working in a place like that, then it's probably not a good place to work. But if you have a shot at converting them by just doing it on your own first, then it would be a great opportunity to get experience with setting up these aspects of a software shop.

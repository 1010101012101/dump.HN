Now that we have computers we can just use mean absolute error|deviation. Before computers, we needed calculus to find the &quot;best fit line&quot; -- parameters that create the least distance between predicted and actual values. Calculus plays well with parabolas but not so great with absolute value functions. Now that computers are around, we don&#x27;t need calculus (as much).",1389819580

Don&#x27;t like the law? Demand a change in the laws instead and stop wasting time on the companies that follow the law.<p>It&#x27;s like that silly issue where everyone gets mad every year at international companies following various country&#x27;s tax laws to reduce their tax obligations as much as possible but never actually demand a change in the laws themselves. They rail against the company as if that will change anything.<p>But to answer the question again, yes indeed, Disney deserves that money because that&#x27;s what the law states. I don&#x27;t understand how I can make that more clear. The fact that they get any money at all from their original creation is directly tied into such laws. Without those laws they have to hope for the best on the goodwill of people to compensate them for their work. As for deserve? They created it didn&#x27;t they? Do they deserve anything at all? If they do, for how long until it could be considered public domain? Should anything be considered public domain after a time at all? That&#x27;s what the law is for, to answer those questions. If you want to change the law, the current law applies until you change it. You can&#x27;t start at zero and build up, you have to start with what&#x27;s already established. Therefore, Disney deserves that money because of the law as it stands today.",1389819303

The second group of participants comprised 13 Ivy League graduate students preparing for a career in financial engineering.

For example, electrical power is proportional to the square of voltage, so AC power systems are conventionally rated by standard deviation.

The documentation and writing that makes remote work possible has an interesting side effect of giving insight into all corners of an organization. While this might not be desired in some organizations, I think it empowers individuals to get a sense of the overall company goals and health and make the best decision of how to use their time.<p>- Remote work breeds trust. Instead of getting the trickle of information from closed door management meetings, you get a log of what is happening and a sense of what decisions are to be made and the implications.<p>- Remote only works if everyone is on board. I have been at organizations that tried to make remote possible, but it never quite worked as some groups refused to monitor the central chat for fear of it taking too much time. You do really need everyone on the same channels and using the same tools to maintain the level of communication required to make remote work.",1389818930

I do a whole variety of development (PHP, golang, python) with MongoDB and MySQL.<p>Currently, I have a few tabs in the terminal open connected to a few servers, MongoHub (MongoDB client), Sequal Pro (MySQL client), Firefox (2 open tabs), Chrome (15 open tabs), Sublime Text 2, Spotify, Cyberduck (FTP/SSH client), MAMP Pro, iTunes (phone is backing up), Adobe Reader, VLC and Excel open.  I usually have those, along with Photoshop and Parallels opened as well and haven&#x27;t felt any slowdown at all.<p>I&#x27;m using the Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 800 and Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000, have a 23&quot; AOC monitor hooked up via Displayport to HDMI adapter from Monoprice.  This setup was probably around ~$1500 without any warranties.  I just picked up a nice SD card that is sized to fit almost flush with the Macbook Air and is 128 GB w/ a fast 90 MB/s read/write which I can use as  a file dump, that cost around $50 on Amazon, but worth picking up a few if you want to isolate projects or just use as backup.<p>Unfortunately, the Macbook family isn&#x27;t too upgrade friendly so you may buy a laptop and it may be underpowered and until you refresh your hardware, you&#x27;ll be stuck with that hardware, so it may take you a few years to get the exact setup you need.  This is why people recommend maxing out as much as you can with RAM and expand hard drive modularly.  I&#x27;d honestly recommend not going with an older model laptop or desktop because HD space is going to end up being your bottle neck, not RAM, and the newer lineups have USB 3.0 so you want to be sure you get that, then you can pick up a 1 TB external USB 3.0 HD for $100 and won&#x27;t suffer with USB 2.0 speeds.",1389818921

When the circuit on the other end is dumb that means a little distortion which reduces the &#x27;clarity&#x27; of the sound you hear.<p>The solution is obvious, buffer, error correct and reclock your data before you turn it to analog again. Expensive USB dacs do this.<p>People thinking digital can be forgetful of the fact that with a regular USB connection, 8% loss on the channel is no problem because corrupt data is simply resent. Audio has a realtime constraint. Another problem with defending based on jitter is that jitter is pretty hard to measure, you need expensive specific measuring hardware.<p>Anyway, this explains why shielding can be important for audio USB cables. It does not explain why the cables are over $15. A reasonable explanation could be that the demand for very high quality cables is so low that it&#x27;s unfeasible to sell them for less than $100.<p>But, if the world of audiophiles was really so rational. Then these reviews would go like this: This $10 cable is nice, but it sounds muddy.  This $100 cable is nicer, it has more clarity. This $1000 cable is really good, the sound is very clear.<p>There would be only 1 sonical property, the clarity, lack of which would be caused by jitter. But, that&#x27;s not the case.

A few years before I met him, he had fired one of his IT staff.  The firing quickly became a debacle, as the recently fired employee had been performing herculean feats to keep the company&#x27;s infrastructure running.  The business owner ultimately needed to hire four new employees at more that the original fellow&#x27;s rate to get everything back under control again.<p>The owner vowed that he&#x27;d never let something like this happen again.  Of course, he decided that this wasn&#x27;t his fault.  After all, if the employee had gotten sick or was hit by a bus, he&#x27;d be in the same situation.  Instead, the problem was that the business had a single point of failure.  Too much business knowledge was only available in a single place.<p>His solution was an early form of Netflix Chaos Monkey, but applied to HR.  A couple of times a year, he&#x27;d fire an employee at random.  The plan was to ensure that knowledge was in the company, not in people.  You didn&#x27;t get used to asking Bill from Accounting how to file your expense forms, since Bill could disappear at any time.  Instead, you insisted that Bill (or whoever was currently in accounting) create easily accessible documentation for the expense forms.  Then, when Bill disappeared, everything was documented and the business continued smoothly.<p>From what I&#x27;ve heard, the owner may now be in minimum security prison for shady financials at the company, so there could have been another reason to encourage people not to stay too long.<p>Edit: Fixed stupid homophone",1389818231

I have personally experienced disks that through firmware errors returned what was essentially a freed memory block from their cache as the sector data, returned success status on a write that never actually happened, and flipped bits in the data they actually returned (without error). The whole point of RAID for data reliability is to catch these things. (RAID for performance is difference and people tolerate errors in exchange for faster performance).<p>We used to start new hire training at NetApp with the question, &quot;How many people here think a disk drive is a storage system?&quot; and then proceed to demolish that idea with real world data that showed just how crappy disks actually were. You don&#x27;t see these things when you look at one drive, but when you have a few thousand to a couple of million out there spinning and reporting on their situation you see these things happen every day.<p>The issue of course is that margins in drives are razor thin and they are always trying to find ways to squeeze another penny out here and there. Generally the expresses itself as dips in drive reliability on a manufacturing cohort basis by a few basis points.

Perhaps because they&#x27;re afraid to lose the support of the many libertarians who still walk among us, net neutrality supporters are afraid to give a fully fleshed-out narrative of what should happen: the government either makes a massive direct investment in increasing information bandwidth (as it has done with transportation bandwidth), or it assimilates the telcos and makes them do so. Finally, the current wave of market-based innovation can continue, supported (as markets always are) by a robust public infrastructure. There is a properly dialectical relationship here: you can&#x27;t have one of these moments without the other, even though they are contradictory.<p>Is this plan perfect?

First book I&#x27;ve read was the one about his time as a day trader and how on the Black Friday market crash, he made a killing and cleared his desk and never had to work again.<p>There are those that dislike his ideas because it is threatening to their existing assumptions about probability and statistics. He argues that experts and majority of people do not account for the unpredictable but significant impact a single event can have which often shatters the commonly held belief. For example, swans were white until the discovery of black swans in Oceania, too big to fail multi-national corporations going bankrupt like Lehman&#x27;s brothers and etc.<p>He&#x27;s not anti-academic, but he is against teachings in the common academia that is based on naive assumptions that is specifically tailored to serve those that thrives most off the limited quantitative measures, such as market callers, hedge funds selling complicated quantitative algorithm trades, academics seeking fame and fortune by writing the most logical and quantitative paper without questioning any of the tools they are using, it is this hypocrisy and laziness that is apparent and those that try to deny to the point of making ad hominem remarks against a man, who simply observes these things and decides to write it in an entertaining manner (otherwise nobody would give a shit because the topic would be dry without lay man&#x27;s linguo).<p>Keep an open mind, a lot of what he says I do find interesting ideas and it has influenced my thinking process quite a bit, however it&#x27;s no way in anyway, grounds for cracking jokes or ridicule, in fact when I read some of the comments here, it&#x27;s a bit shameful. We should be embracing new ideas in order to explore them, regardless of who the explosive nature of the claim, because the black swan event is very real and is not captured or understood completely by our current set of statistical tools and methodology based on questionable assumptions about how the real world operates. For example, 1/2500 chance is not what we really think it means in the real world because black swan events are more common than we think, a percentage probability do not fully reflect it&#x27;s frequency and the magnitude of it&#x27;s event.<p>Note the fall of crime rates in the United States following a decision to legalize abortion, economists and experts would come on television and bring up all sorts of random theories and ideas but little did they realize it was a chain effect from a court ruling passed decades ago until two economists came out with a paper that was ridiculed because it suggested that &#x27;killing babies from poor neighbourhoods = lower crime rate&#x27; where most poor neighbourhoods is occupied by African Americans. Because such idea was earthshakingly controversial and still denied even to this day. Because Galileo claimed the earth was round instead of flat, he was executed.

Sometimes just seeing how something is organized, or the API can give significant clues to how it is done.  It is much harder to start from scratch.<p><i>Do we have any alternatives? Are there any completely open radio chips in development?</i><p>See my parent post.  First you need a few billion dollars to buy some spectrum.",1389816005

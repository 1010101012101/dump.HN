This is blatant arrogant thievery, while also accusing both transient travelers and their local constituents of being morons for falling for this veneer of an excuse: oh it&#x27;s for drunks N drugs, OK! At the very least the police could have restricted this to race and class as subterfuge, but no this was absolutely brazen: give us your fucking money grandpa! That&#x27;s what really happened.<p>I will bet they had a lot more resources for doing searches than they did sobriety checks for those who refused the search. The search would therefore seem fast, while you probably had an insane line waiting for a sobriety test.

But I do want to respond to the comment by quonn below, which is an example of a broader type of comment for these kinds of news: some _developing_country_ invests in _scientific_project_. People say, why are you wasting money on this when you should be feeding your people? To that I say, countries should be feeding their people, as well as investing in science. As an individual, you are constrained by money because you can&#x27;t print it. To a country, money does literally grow on trees, and a country can print as much money as it wants. What should a country do to remove poverty? Invest in projects that create jobs - massive infrastructure projects come to mind here. But also invest in cutting edge science and build a scientific infrastructure. A country should, to create new knowledge, attempt that which others have not attempted. Kennedy&#x27;s Man on the Moon speech is very much in this spirit. Eventually scientific progress made anywhere benefits all humanity. So I cheer India (or any other country) in such efforts.",1421445033

8901957,comment,8896590,8900329,0,0,Chinjut,,,"Hm... You&#x27;re saying it can be possible to solve two different ways with two different numbers?<p>Suppose the corners and the center are black and the other squares are white. Then every two moves in a row adds one to black and one to white. So an even length sequence keeps the difference between the black sum and the white sum the same. In the end, with all values set to X, this difference equals 5X - 4X = X.<p>Thus, for an even-length game, we know from the start what X must be: the difference between the black and white sums.<p>This means there&#x27;s no room for a wrong move. Any solution has a prescribed number of times to hit each tile. (FWIW, the total number of moves will be 9X - the starting sum = 9(B - W) - (B + W) = 8B - 10W)<p>So far, we&#x27;ve assumed we&#x27;ll be playing an even-length game. Might we actually be playing an odd-length game? Sure. In that case, we also know from the start what X should be (since it amounts to making one move, adding 1 to the color not started on, and then playing an even-length game).<p>Is there an easy way to see from the start whether we play an even- or odd-length game? Is it possible that both are allowed for a given board? It&#x27;s not yet clear to me. I&#x27;ll reply with updates. But at any rate, there are at most two different values you can solve with, one for even-length solutions and another for odd-length solutions (and these two values will be next to each other).<p>[This is all for the version of the game in the early levels. I see from other comments that the game changes at level 51, which I haven&#x27;t played to yet. I also see that &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; start actually being used in the game at that point, making this explanation potential confusing.]",1421444992

It was like the entire world was just letting the status quo sit for a while so see how things settled after such a large political change (e.g. would Russia turn into a western-style democracy?).<p>And I think the Ukraine incident gave everyone (mostly europe and the US) a wake up call that not only has Russia not changed, but it is likely not going to change. So now you have Russia buddying up to Cuba again, and you also have a Russia which is a legitimate threat to world peace (which isn&#x27;t to say I think Russia will attack the US, I mean world peace in the sense of Russia picking fights with its direct neighbours).<p>So the US had a choice to make, they could either keep ignoring Cuba while keeping its evidently ineffective embargo going, or they could try to buddy up with Cuba. Given Russia&#x27;s current financial position (read: bad) and the US&#x27;s position (read: good) it makes a lot of sense for Cuba to pick the US right now over Russia.<p>The money forgiveness is just the &quot;cherry on top.&quot; The fact that Cuba is now largely out of Russia&#x27;s pocket financially just makes it even easier for the US to influence Cuba, which they&#x27;ve already started doing.<p>But ultimately with or without the forgiveness Cuba needs trade and tourism from the US. Russia cannot offer that logistically. I&#x27;d describe it with this analogy: &quot;Russia and the US are both employers, but you owe Russia money, Russia says that if you work for them they&#x27;ll reduce your dept but pay you nothing, the US says that if you work for them they&#x27;ll just pay you normally and if you wish to pay off the Russia debt so be it (but can keep it after).&quot;",1421444949

And that&#x27;s not to say T-Mobile&#x27;s existing LTE network isn&#x27;t great, it&#x27;s fantastic (if you can actually get it).<p>AT&T is out of new deployable spectrum so their LTE network is slowing down in congested areas. They are deploying tens of thousands of small cell sites to make their network more dense to help with this problem. So say a tower has 100 people sharing 20mhz (10x10) of LTE bandwidth at the same time. If there are now three small cell sites placed away from that tower, each additional site has 20mhz of spectrum to use. So there would then be ~25 on that main tower, and ~25 on each additional small cell site.<p>Verizon&#x27;s original 700mhz LTE network is very congested in a lot of areas, but instead of deploying as many small sites as AT&T, they instead bought that very large chunk of AWS spectrum from cable companies and have it deployed to the majority of their cell sites. In major cities this is a full 40mhz chunk of spectrum (20x20) which theoretically can net you up to 150Mb/s if you have the right device that can use band 4. They also have started re-farming a small portion of their PCS spectrum (10mhz total) in some testing areas (san francisco especially). They will need to densify their network eventually but they sure have done a great job at buying an ample amount of time.<p>I personally feel Sprint&#x27;s current slump all comes down to the Clearwire/WiMax decision. Both Sprint and Verizon were in the same situation when it came to deploy their choices of 4G technologies. They both operated CDMA/EVDO 3G networks which with the revision they were using maxed out around 3.1Mb/s. AT&T was in the middle of deploying their HSPA/HSPA+, what they now call &quot;4G&quot; (not to be confused with LTE). Verizon and Sprint did not have the option of this transition period of significantly higher speeds that was not LTE or WiMax. Surprisingly Verizon got this right. They obtained a nationwide chunk of 700mhz block c (band 13) spectrum for their initial LTE network they started deploying in early 2011. This is the same spectrum that has the open access rules attached to it that made them back down on throttling on their LTE network. The sheer speed at which they deployed this LTE spectrum was just ridiculously fast. Right now they have 99% of their entire 3G footprint covered with that layer of LTE while AT&T&#x27;s national map is still nowhere close to Verizon in terms of overall LTE deployment covering their entire legacy networks.<p>Meanwhile Sprint went ahead with WiMax and we all know how that unfolded. I hope they can recover as 4 national carriers is always going to be better than 3 competition wise, but I just don&#x27;t see it happening for potentially years from now.<p>In terms of network, Verizon got it 100% right the entire time. AT&T struggled in ~2009 with the iPhone and recovered but is feeling the effects of congestion but they are countering with tons of small cell sites. Verizon has congestion on the band 13 LTE deployment, but band 4 is helping with that. T-Mobile&#x27;s LTE deployments are great, but they are still focusing on expanding into more rural areas. Sprint is working on their Spark network, and where you can get it, it&#x27;s good, but they just are moving so damn slow I don&#x27;t know if it will be fast enough in the long run.",1421444937

Every time the government makes a bank pay out money to settle accusations of financial asset misrepresentation (eg some of the shenanigans around mortgage-backed securities), the Wall Street Journal and its ilk wax wroth about &#x27;government shakedowns&#x27; and so forth. So imagine the response if the DoJ launched criminal prosecutions of big bank CEOs in addition to fraudsters like Bernie Madoff - there would be cries about a communist takeover and what-all else.<p>It&#x27;s also true that the regulatory environment was sufficiently lax, and the chain of responsibility sufficiently convoluted, that it would have been hard to make any such prosecutions stick. Financial crime is generally slow to come to trial anyway because it&#x27;s so hard to prove intent beyond a reasonable doubt, and so hard to pin it on any individual in a sufficiently large organization. As well as (possibly) leading to political upheaval and (definitely) causing a major chilling effect on business activity in the middle of the worst financial crisis in almost everyone&#x27;s living memory, it would have been ethically, legally, and strategically problematic to bring charges that would not be easily provable at trial. If the CEO of (imaginary) MegaBank had been put on trial and the case collapsed, it would have poised every other prosecution for 20 years. That&#x27;s not rational, but at the national level prosecutions have a big political dimension, there&#x27;s just no getting away from it.<p>My read is that the administration opted to go the route of administrative penalties with the twin goals of maintaining relative stability in the financial industry and getting Dodd-Frank passed on congress to provide much stronger regulatory options for the longer term. It&#x27;s not an emotionally satisfying strategy, but a pragmatic one taken in the interests of continuity. I would have preferred a top-to-bottom shakeout of the financial industry, and maybe a change in the economic and social order that would result, but the problem with revolutionary changes is that once begun it&#x27;s hard to stop them turning. Look at the French revolution; half the instigators ended up on the guillotine themselves and 10 years after France had got rid of a king they ended up with an emperor.",1421444766

    @(next *stdin*)
    @(repeat)
    @type: @message
    #@code: FILE: @path:@lineno:
    @(output)
    @path:@lineno:@type (#@code):@message
    @(end)
    @(end)
</code></pre>
This is &quot;pure TXR&quot;: there are no traces of the embedded programming language TXR Lisp.  Stuff that isn&#x27;t @ident or @(syntax) is literal text which is matched. So the block<p><pre><code>    @type: @message
    #@code: FILE: @path:@lineno:
</code></pre>
matches a two-line pattern in the checkpatch output, extracting a type, followed by a space and colon, the message, then on the next line a code value prceded by a hash mark, followed by &quot;: FILE: &quot; and then a path delimited by a colon, and a line number terminated by a colon.<p>The following more complicated script scans diff output (usually the output of `git show -p` or `git diff`) and produces an &quot;errors.err&quot; file for Vim such that &quot;vim -q&quot; will navigate over the diffs as a quickfix list, and the messages have some information, like how many lines were added or removed at that point by the diff.<p>Here, there is an overall pattern matching logic for scanning the sections of a diff output: parsing out multiple diffs, and the &quot;hunks&quot; within each diff, with the line number info from the hunk header and such.<p>Some stateful Lisp logic calculates what is needed out of the extracted pieces and produces the output as it goes.<p><pre><code>    #!/usr/local/bin/txr

Without the agency-specific revenue enhancement provided by federal seizure rules, there is far less incentive for police to pursue seizure.<p>(That doesn&#x27;t mean they won&#x27;t still when they have other motivations, like &quot;punishing&quot; a target that they don&#x27;t have sufficient evidence to criminally charge.

How does a poor country become rich? Why by developing its science and technology, of course (well technically, by becoming more productive, but you know what I&#x27;m saying). If we don&#x27;t develop our own science and tech, we&#x27;re going to be relegated to manufacturing textiles and outsourced software projects pretty much forever. Doing those things hasn&#x27;t eliminated hunger so far, so why expect anything different in the future?<p>2. How much aid does India really receive? According to Wikipedia (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_foreign_aid_received"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_foreign_ai...</a>) it ranked 18th on the list in 2012. Sounds high, until you consider that the normally-considered-developed countries of Israel and Turkey are 4th and 5th on the list. On a per-capita basis, I&#x27;m willing to bet it is even lower<p>3. How much do you really know about how the Indian government spends its money? Did you know we spend about 38 times as much on our armed forces as our space agency? Like any other large government, we waste money on some areas and allocate and spend it wisely in others. Research that produces results is never a waste and many Indian government agencies (ISRO and DRDO) have a solid track record in this regard.<p>4. There are immediate benefits to science and tech spending to even poor Indians. For example Oceansat-2, a remote sensing satellite launched by ISRO (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceansat-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceansat-2</a>). Per Wikipedia, it&#x27;s used for coastal zone planning and identification of fishing areas, among other things. Other satellites provide weather information, which again is used by fishermen, many of whom are poor. Not to mention all the spin-off technology from defense and other research (handwaving, but I can&#x27;t be bothered to look up citations right now). EDIT: ISRO also _makes_ money by taking on satellite launching contracts. Their commercial arm Antrix Corp made $33m profit in 2013-2014 (if I&#x27;m doing the conversion right: <a href=""http://www.antrix.gov.in/pdf/ANNUAL_REPORT_2013_2014_English.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.antrix.gov.in/pdf/ANNUAL_REPORT_2013_2014_English...</a>)<p>5. Like another commenter has mentioned elsewhere, we produce surplus food. The reason it doesn&#x27;t get to all the hungry people who need it is pretty much the same reason people go hungry in developed countries: market failures and government aid not reaching the right people at the right time. These aren&#x27;t things that are solved by diverting money away from research (unless it&#x27;s to hand out straight cash to poor people, I guess, which almost no country does).<p>There&#x27;s always a rash of commenters saying &quot;feed your hungry&quot; whenever they read a story about India doing science. I hope I&#x27;ve reduced their numbers by one at least.",1421443730

I would suspect this is why you are confident with your friends but not with other people.  When you are with your friends, you are comfortable with what you say, how you act, what they are thinking but with other people, you are probably second guessing some aspect of your nature.<p>If you want to be confident with a wider group of people, you need to understand what part of you are you not comfortable showing to other people.  For some people, it is physical.  They do not believe they are attractive enough and so it holds them back.  For some, it is intellectual, &quot;what if I say something dumb or unimpressive&quot;.  There are a myriad of possibilities and it is probably a good use of your time to understand what your issues are (and why you have those hangups).<p>There are a number ways to deal with your hang ups.  One way that works is to apply brute force.  Just act inspite of your anxiety.  I suspect that a majority of people that appear really confident just take this approach.  They&#x27;re scared but just do it anyway.<p>Another approach is to try and remove the root of the fear altogether.  Some people do that by actually courting failure.  You think people are judging your intellect, then say the dumbest thing you can think of and see what happens.  Scared people don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re good looking, approach people completely out of your league.  The idea is to actively cause the situation you are afraid of so that you can experience it (instead of imagining it) and realize it isn&#x27;t so bad.<p>Whichever approach you decide to take, I would suggest you ensure you do take action to deal with it.  Anxiety has a way of making you feel like crap, which leads to further inaction, leading to more anxiety and then a spiral of regret and wasted time.  The truth is there is not much that can happen to you that will crush you completely.  Time and the love of a few heals all wounds.<p>Good luck!",1421443712

at all, certainly not peer-review.<p>After reading their Guru Ramaswamy&#x27;s <i>radiative forcing</i>
it was totally clear that they were totally worthless
for anything meaningful.<p>They are a political organization trying to raise money
by carbon taxes on the developed countries to transfer
wealth to the third world.<p>Somehow I just lost 37 points today, 5
points from my post here
and another 4 points on a post on how to help a 7 year old girl
who went to the wrong <i>comic book</i> store.  
Apparently with HN arithmetic, 5 + 4 = 39.<p>For the girl,
I suggested
she go to a music store that focused on classical
music.  I also suggested the movies, stores of
American Girl.  The comic book shop was right next to porn.
Gee, my suggestion was not liked.<p>> the vitriol that you fire at the NYT&#x27;s opinions<p>The NYT has long been and still is a NYC wild-eyed
liberal,
bleeding-heart, emotional hysteria organization,
heavily for wealthy English majors and wannabees.<p>I deeply, profoundly, bitterly hate and despise
the NYT, but I fired no &quot;vitriol&quot; but (1) 
said good things about their graph but (2)
criticized them for using extreme values to
get people excited.<p>Again, once again, over again, one more time,
rock solid, for such a situation extreme values
may be better than no data at all but, given
good average data, one more time, this time just
for you, once again, maybe you will actually
read it this time, you can read, right, 
the extreme value data is useless.  Or,
some solid advice -- f&#x27;get about extreme value
data.  Stuff it for <i>the hottest</i>, the <i>coldest</i>,
the <i>least ice</i>, the <i>fastest winds</i>, etc.<p>Leave the importance of extreme values to, say,
Olympic records.  For GDP, that&#x27;s an average.
For the corn crop, we want an average.
For crude oil production, we want an average,
say, monthly.  For global temperature 
to consider <i>global warming</i>, we want an average.
An average, not extreme values.<p>One biggie reason for the importance of the average
is that it essentially is, has to be, what&#x27;s important,
e.g., the area under the curve, the total energy
involved, etc.  The average per day times the number
of days is the total, e.g., as for your income
and paying your taxes.<p>But the NYT will use anything they can get away with
to get their readers all hysterical, up on their
hind legs, believing in their trilogy of
transgression by evil humans against the
pure, pristine, precious, 100% all-natural
mother earth.  So, it&#x27;s a 1000 year old
morality play they learned in English literature
class.  Then there is the retribution part --
destroy the coral reefs, the oceans, the whales,
the forests, NYC via rising sea levels, 
etc.  Then there is the redemption --
suffering, sacrifice, self-denial.
So, walk or ride bicycles, use electric
cars (NYC liberals hate anything having to
do with cars -- in Texas, Wyoming, and Montana
they like cars).  In this way the NYT creates
a story and an audience for their story and
then just keeps running such stories to feed
their audience.  They also make NYC liberals
feel good.  If you don&#x27;t see this transparent
manipulation, too bad -- it&#x27;s what they&#x27;ve
been doing for decades.  You&#x27;ve been
manipulated by some people who want your
eyeballs, your money, your time, etc.<p>What&#x27;s going on with the temperature of the
planet?  No one knows.  The record is totally
clear -- the computer models have been 
wildly off.  The models are far too much in
agreement and far too far away from reality --
what the models predicted for now is much, much
higher temperatures than we are seeing.<p>Just why the models are wrong, no one knows.
Maybe they got the Navier-Stokes equations
right, or the sunspot data right, or the
black body radiation right, or the convection
right, or some such, but messed up on the
biological effects, the oceans, or whatever.<p>Maybe we are still slowly pulling out of The Little
Ice Age.  As we warm from The Little Ice age,
we will also have to warm the oceans, and they are
mostly 3 miles down and 7 miles or so over
much of the Pacific; it might take a long time
to warm the oceans from the cooling they got
in The Little Ice Age.
There is the NAS report that shows
that from year 900 to year 1000, just before
The Little Ice Age started, the temperature
was increasing very rapidly, about the same
as the past 100 years, and that increase
had nothing to do with human generation of
CO2.<p>But, given their record, and their
nonsense with extreme values,
there&#x27;s no way to
trust the NYT.  So, we need to get their
data from other sources.  They have to
name the sources or we have to regard their
writing as just <i>drama</i>.  NASA?  Sadly
they may have been bent by Obama who wants
<i>global warming</i> as one of his issues.<p>While I hate the NYT, all I wrote about them
was that they wanted people to get excited
about extreme values, and there I was
rock solidly correct.  If you can&#x27;t see this,
then that&#x27;s your problem.",1421442839

A shell script that uses awk commands can be full POSIX compliant and work on any POSIX-like system with minimal changes, without the installation of third-party software.<p>So, with Awk you can do a lot of things that would otherwise require something like Python. In many cases you can do them with clearer code that has less clutter, <i>and</i> your solution is POSIX, to boot.<p>The down side of Awk is that it sacrifices reliability to pander to succinctness. Awk does not detect undefined variables; any variable you mention becomes defined. It has loose arithmetic: this is so you can increment a nonexistent variable or array element by one, and it behaves as if it had been defined with zero. Awk only has local variables in functions, and they are modeled as extra parameters (for which you could pass values, but you don&#x27;t, unless perpetrating a hack).<p>Basically, whereas you can do actual software engineering in Python and Ruby, you&#x27;d be crazy to do it in Awk, even if the lack of libraries and datatypews such isn&#x27;t an impediment against doing it in Awk.",1421442424

Its hard to join something like that and if you do, the projects themselves usualy need UX design not some pretty colors and some logo. But thats exactly what engeneers mostly want. I dont blame them, they spend lot of effort to make the project and they have their own ideas about how it should work (for them).<p>But good UX is about objectivity and about efficiency. Its also a process.<p>Another thing is that there is no tradition in that for designers. Opensource programming free time fun project for programmer is equivalent maybe something like making print posters for designers.<p>And interaction design schools are hardly helping that, they should make students to help out on opensource projects maybe as part of their assignments/diplomas.<p>How would i join opensource projects that need designers?

8901682,comment,8900016,8901475,0,0,sillysaurus3,,,"Sure, let&#x27;s go over it together.  Tlb is many things, but &quot;rarely wrong&quot; is probably near the top of the list.  He certainly read those sections before making that comment, so there must be something here which made him as an engineering expert say that it doesn&#x27;t properly address thermal expansion.  I&#x27;ll try to run an emulator of tlb&#x27;s mind, but mine is far less sharp.<p><i>The tube will be supported by pillars which constrain the tube in the vertical
direction but allow longitudinal slip for thermal expansion as well as dampened
lateral slip to reduce the risk posed by earthquakes. In addition, the pillar to
tube connection nominal position will be adjustable vertically and laterally to
ensure proper alignment despite possible ground settling. These minimally
constrained pillars to tube joints will also allow a smoother ride. Specially
designed slip joints at stations will be able to take any tube length variance
due to thermal expansion. This is an ideal location for the thermal expansion
joints as the speed is much lower nearby the stations. It thus allows the tube to
be smooth and welded along the high speed gliding middle section.</i><p>This seems like the key sentence:<p><i>Specially designed slip joints at stations will be able to take any tube length variance
due to thermal expansion.</i><p>There are two stations, one in SF and one in LA:  <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/3TavjCY.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/3TavjCY.png</a><p>(For simplicity, let&#x27;s assume it&#x27;s just the main route.)<p>That would mean each station needs to absorb 150 meters of thermal expansion.  (Would anyone mind double-checking that tlb&#x27;s calculation is correct?)<p>So it looks like the tube is resting on these things: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/srQjmps.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/srQjmps.png</a><p>and the plan is for the tube to expand due to heat, and the expansion will be absorbed at the two stations at the end.<p>Is that really feasible, especially given that different points along the route could have temperature differences?  I drove along Highway 1 and saw how incredibly different the weather can get, and while that&#x27;s south of where the route is planned, it&#x27;s easy to imagine that part of the tube could be roasting in direct sunlight while the other is cooled by rain.  Something like 90 degrees F at one part vs 70F at another part.  That&#x27;s a difference of 32.22C to 21.11C, or a total temperature difference of 11.11C.<p>The route from SF to LA is about 350 miles.  If a tube of that length expands 300 meters, then we can divide 300 meters by 350 miles to get the total expansion over a single mile.  So a variation of 40C would give an expansion of 0.85 meters within a single mile.<p>Since the variation in that scenario would be ~11C, multiplying the expansion by 11C/40C equals an expansion of 0.235 meters.<p>So I suppose the question is:  Is it feasible for those things the tube is resting on to absorb a quarter meter of expansion without that expansion being pushed all the way up to the station?  It&#x27;s the temperature differential along the route that seems to matter, not necessarily the difference from summer to winter.<p>Judging by this screenshot: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/wgUJqWr.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/wgUJqWr.png</a><p>... it seems like an expansion of 0.25 meters might be a big deal.<p>But I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about.  Is all of that about right so far?<p>I&#x27;d also be curious whether the thermal expansion results in the tube becoming bigger in the circular direction, like a bigger &quot;O&quot;, or if it expands parallel to the tube, like becoming a longer tube.  Or even both.<p>It seems like the plan addresses this with the first part of that paragraph:<p><i>The tube will be supported by pillars which constrain the tube in the vertical
direction but allow longitudinal slip for thermal expansion as well as dampened
lateral slip to reduce the risk posed by earthquakes. In addition, the pillar to
tube connection nominal position will be adjustable vertically and laterally to
ensure proper alignment despite possible ground settling.</i><p>But again, where precisely does 0.25m of steel go?  I&#x27;m having trouble visualizing how the pillars could &quot;allow for 0.25m of longitudinal slip over 1 mile.&quot;<p>I realize that a temperature variation of about 10C over 1 mile is a little extreme, but we should examine how the system handles extreme situations.",1421442189

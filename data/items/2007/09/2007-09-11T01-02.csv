53098,comment,53066,53078,0,0,mxh,,,"Frankly, even if the improvement is worth the work, I think this is the wrong kind of work.  Writing a custom toolbar (that doesn't, according to the article, work the same as all the other toolbars the user is used to seeing) seems like the wrong call.  Better to alter the design to be (a.) spiffy and (b.) compatible with the technical limitations of the system.<p>I think it's often better to work within the constraints of a system than to fight against them.  Sometimes, of course, it's a Big Win to fight them, and sometimes it's fun, but you gotta pick those battles.  (As I'm sure everyone agrees.  Sounds like Hamming's talk, in a different context, actually.)",1189475997

Make a decision now to do what needs to be done regardless of your application's outcome. You need to have the mindset ""I'm doing this anyway, and if I get funding it's a bonus""<p>Kudos for doing something to escape. Work takes on a different outlook now, hey?",1189475115

53089,comment,53066,53078,0,0,alex_c,,,">And we ended up writing our own very faux-toolbar from scratch.<p>It SHOULDN'T be a tough call in a situation like this.  There shouldn't even be a call to make.  I literally got goosebumps when I read that paragraph in the article.<p>This is a textbook example of goldplating.  No, actually... this goes beyond goldplating.  It's goldplating combined with reinventing the wheel.<p>There is NO WAY the extra effort this requires will be worth it.  The initial effort to implement it - maybe.  The initial effort plus the extra effort to maintain their own faux-toolbar - no way.  I'm willing to bet that in version 2 - or at most version 3 - it will be replaced with a standard toolbar.<p>What happened to KISS?  Like I've said in another post - if something is getting more and more complicated as you work on it, it's time to backtrack because there's a good chance that you're doing it wrong.<p>I'm happy that the designer got nice-looking buttons, but I think the rest of the team dropped the ball on this one by allowing it.  I'm not usually this vehement about something, but there's no conceivable way I can be convinced that this was the right decision.",1189474137

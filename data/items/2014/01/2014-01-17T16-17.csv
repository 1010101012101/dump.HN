The number of interviews I&#x27;ve conducted where the candidate has <i>heard of</i> trees before, but cannot articulate, even in a basic way, what they are, is depressing.<p>To be more clear, the basic level I&#x27;m expecting is &quot;it&#x27;s a way to store data, where one object has children objects, which in turn have children objects&quot;, or something along that theme. Really, if you articulate in some way that it&#x27;s stuff pointing to other stuff, you&#x27;re already further along than half the people I&#x27;ve interviewed.<p>A <i>lot</i> of people can&#x27;t even get that far.<p>These questions aren&#x27;t designed to defeat you, they&#x27;re questions that have depth so that you can get some idea about the candidate&#x27;s level of understanding of data structures. Once you get past &quot;it&#x27;s an object with children&quot; we can go deeper - what is the complexity of fetching an object out of a tree? What of sorting? Disadvantages and advantages in application? Cycle detection? All of these are nice to haves - but the basic requirement is that you have to know what a tree is.",1389977978

7076814,comment,7076464,7076464,12,0,higherpurpose,,,"What upset me most about his speech is him conflating the issues of protection against terrorists and protection against cyber-attacks, implying that they are basically the same, and that the NSA is just as useful for both.<p>I won&#x27;t discuss the fact that 12 years of surveillance have led to no results on stopping any terrorist plots, as the NSA has already admitted, but the NSA has actually made cyberattacks <i>more</i> likely because they are undermining the security of everything, including US infrastructure.<p>As Schneier says, it&#x27;s not a question of whether we allow the NSA to spy on everyone or not. It&#x27;s a question of whether we allow <i>every attacker</i> to spy or attack our networks - or we try to make everything more secure by default.<p>So when president Obama implies that NSA should keep hoarding their vulnerabilities into systems, he&#x27;s choosing the former, rather than the latter. He&#x27;s making cyberattacks <i>more</i> likely, not less. The way you defend against cyberattacks is by increasing security, not by increasing your offense capabilities.<p>If they <i>really</i> cared about the security of US infrastructure, they&#x27;d divulge the vulnerabilities they found or bought from the black market that exploit the security of these systems, so those systems can be <i>fixed</i>, and no one else can exploit them with these exploits. Instead they keep them for themselves so <i>they</i> can exploit them. That&#x27;s not just wrong. It&#x27;s incredibly dangerous and reckless, especially from an agency that supposedly wants to &quot;protect us&quot;.",1389977925

It&#x27;s too easy to implement something that can do the 1-or-0 elements in Maybe, but still isn&#x27;t a Monad. You should also do a conditional, which I believe this code fails; that is, a monadic computation can examine the intermediate results and make flow-control decisions.<p>The minimal example is probably something like:<p><pre><code>    minimal :: Int -> [(Int, Int)]\n    minimal i = do\n        x <- [i, i + 1]\n        y <- [i, 10 * i]\n        if i `mod` 2 == 0\n            then return (x, y)\n            else return (y, x)\n</code></pre>\nRunning this in GHCi, I get:<p><pre><code>    > minimal 2\n    [(2,2),(2,20),(3,2),(3,20)]\n    > minimal 3\n    [(3,3),(30,3),(3,4),(30,4)]\n</code></pre>\nThe evenness or oddness of the parameter controls which side of the tuple gets which element.<p>It may still be possible to implement this without implementing a full monadic computation, but if you can pass this test using something like bind or join, you&#x27;re probably at least on the right track.",1389977814

Additionally, there are too many companies out in the world who are just looking for the cheapest developer that they can find. This combination creates a huge problem. I would venture to guess that most  weekend PHP developers think that they are capable of developing in Magento. I mean, do you think you can take on any new PHP project and figure out how to make it work? While some may have skills to do such, it is the large marjority that do not have the drive, desire, or knowledge to do this the right way. In the end, it is this group of people who are giving others in the Community a bad name. They hack Mage code, lack even basic development skills, and leave projects in an even worse position than when they started. The Magento community can only do so much in education and help. Additionally, Magento recognized that this was a huge problem and started providing training with Magento U. While this may not be cost effective for every developer in the world, at least Magento has acknowledged that this need exists and continues to provide training and new programs on an ongoing basis. TLDR, Magento is complex, and complex systems are not meant for every developer in the  world. Pick your developers wisely and they will not burn you with bad code.

However, if I interpret the numbers they are quoting as from 2013 with the delta from the year previous, I am unable to reproduce the BLS&#x27; numbers from 2012.<p>I am confused by the magnitude of the discrepancy.

The one-year gain in that segment is, according to the BLS, over 100,000 jobs, again assuming that we&#x27;re looking at 2011 to 2012.<p>I have taken the liberty of repeating the analysis while intentionally making several easy processing mistakes in interpreting the 2012 data, for example looking at the numbers for only the private sector.

System halts with striped lines ect.<p>- I contacted Apple care to ask if I would be eligible under this program, they told me that since BestBuy had shut down they would honour the extended warranty should it be diagnosed as a manufacturing fault.<p>- I booked an appointment at the Apple Store (Bristol Cabot Circus) to have the laptop tested. They confirmed a GPU fault and told me that Apple wasn&#x27;t responsible for upholding the extended warranty. I told them I would get back in contact with Apple care as this contradicted what I had been told before.<p>- I spoke to a Apple Care Senior Technical Support Advisor at AppleCare again and he told me that the store was wrong and do not deal with these niche cases as often. He enquired about the test that was run on my laptop and told me that they still needed to confirm if this was a general fault or a manufacturing fault. This I have been told can not be done at the Apple Store since it was not bought from there (both I and him found this very unusual).<p>- I was told I would need to book in a &#x27;Consumer Law Claim&#x27; test at a company called Western Computer in Bristol. If this test confirmed a valid consumer law issue I would not be liable to pay the fee for the test of £78.00 and the hardware repair would be carried out for free. However if it indicated a general fault I would have to pay this myself.\nBefore having this test run I wanted to ask what was involved and how one distinguishes a general fault from a manufacturing fault. I got a vague reply that indicated the test was software based which didn&#x27;t give me much confidence that this test would throw the &quot;error code&quot; that was required for a consumer law repair.<p>- As of now I am waiting to see how this plays out, it&#x27;s hit the tech news now and I am hoping just like in 2008 and 2010 there will be a class action lawsuit that will save me all this hassle. I don&#x27;t think I will get the test run at this time as I want to save myself the expense.\nI&#x27;ll keep this updated with my progress.",1389976845

Many of the players pocketed the savings and just never followed up with their end of that deal.<p>Also, network congestion has nothing to do with bandwidth limits (data caps, really). If you are transferring large amounts of data at 3am on a Tuesday when the rest of the network usage is almost non-existent, then you are not impacting anything. If you are doing it at 8pm on a Friday night, you probably are contributing to network congestion. So, why apply the concept of a limited resource (data) across the board?<p>We are done with the lie from telecoms that data is somehow a precious resource. It is an artificial constraint used to justify both lack of infrastructure investment and jacking up prices on customers. This is no longer a point of contention as it is finally known industry-wide and covered by the press (finally) as of a couple years ago.<p>Think of data caps in relation to a freeway. That freeway can carry a certain number of cars at one time. That is the only constraint. Cars that are driving at 2am when the freeway is empty are not eating into tomorrow&#x27;s rush-hour-drive freeway traffic capacity. It is a constant. Likewise, it is not your 300gb of data per month that is impacting the network. It is when you are transferring that data.<p>And, finally, since the telecoms claim that &quot;only two percent of users use a lot of bandwidth&quot; and that something like 95% of users do nothing but check their email and watch one or two youtube videos a week, then there should be PLENTY of bandwidth left over for these bandwidth hogs. The solution is simple if that is the reality (which it isn&#x27;t): Make email the highest priority in your traffic shaping. That way, those horrible people consuming a ton of bandwidth are not impacting the flow of those 12 kilobyte messages passing by here and there.<p>Oh, and finally, people do not go over their bandwidth limits because of p2p traffic. They go over it because it is 2014 and Netflix movies run several gigabytes per hour and people consume a lot of movies/tv shows every month and multiple people live in a single home. They go over it because they listen to lots of podcasts or watch video podcasts which run a gigabyte an hour. They watch streaming online networks, listen to streaming music, use remote online backup services, use VOIP, watch youtube, watch twitch.tv, stream to twitch.tv.<p>Youtube and Netflix account for just over 50% of traffic.\nP2P accounts for 10%.",1389975486

That is no small thing; families were starving to death in the rural areas, whereas so far as I know they had it better in Pyongyang.<p>But, it is a &#x27;show&#x27; city. It is the only place where foreigners are allowed, for example. School children do not go to school to learn. They go to school and drill endlessly in song, dance, marching, playing musical instruments, and so on. Then they put on shows for visiting dignitaries, government officials, and tourists. Woe be to the child that makes a mistake. Where &#x27;woe&#x27; could include prison camp for them and their family.<p>Use Google Earth, and look around the city. Then go to some no-name China city and do the same. In Pyongyang the streets are very wide, yet entirely empty. It is thought that part of the emptiness is due to the famine - millions died - but it is also because it is a facade. Entire tall apartment buildings and factories are built - and left empty. Most of the tall buildings, so far as we can tell, are empty. People are employed to mill in and out to give the appearance of business, but Google earth tells the real story - this is a ghost town. I mean truly empty. You&#x27;ll see a few trucks or cars, and a few people walking around, but otherwise...entirely empty.

7076443,comment,7075228,7075558,3,0,dredmorbius,,,"The online communities I&#x27;ve seen work best generally:<p>⚫ Are selective.  Actual or de-facto barriers to casual participation exist.<p>⚫ Are focused around a specific interest.  Usually topical, occasionally by geography.<p>⚫ Are based around discussion from people interested in <i>receiving</i> as well as <i>transmitting</i>.  The traditional exceptions to these are trolls and spammers, but I had a brief experience on mailing list that was heavily subscribed by people in the entertainment industry some years back.  It was <i>horrible</i>.  For, several reasons:  people in love with the sound of their own voice, top-post/forward style messages (3 lines on top of 3000 wasn&#x27;t uncommon), and ultimately far too many participants for the forum.  Even though it wasn&#x27;t spam / trolling / SEO, it was about the worst and most useless forum I&#x27;d ever seen.<p>Having well-established formatting and quoting styles matters.  That&#x27;s one of the things I enjoy about reddit, especially as compared with G+:  the richer markdown, and inclusion of blockquote syntax, helps hugely.  One idiot on G+ (who I finally blocked, for various reasons) had the habit of using an inline quote/response format, but his marking syntax (python-style quote tagging, I think), was all but impossible to follow.  Dealing with his BS <i>and</i> difficult-to-follow style really weren&#x27;t worth it.  Oh, and it&#x27;d be nice if HN had a proper blockquote markdown as well ...<p>Also from G+:  I noticed that without a proper &quot;plaza&quot;, what you tended to end up with were, effectively, cocktail parties:  hosts (users) who has a sufficient level of followers that they&#x27;d kick off conversations, as well as a good seed, and policing of guests to keep everything in line.  Discussion nucleated around posts and specific users.  Not communities, not topics, not pages.<p>Communities were and are effectively dead outside a very few exceptions, largely due to the inability to filter out crap.  And even with the cocktail-party mode, there was a very narrow goldilocks zone:  too few followers and discussions wouldn&#x27;t get off the ground, too many and it rapidly got inane (effectively somewhere between a college kegger and a street brawl), and hosts who were either uninspiring or absentee would (respectively) garner similarly inane commentary and/or have largely directionless commentary.<p>I find the dynamics of discussions fascinating.<p>Hrm.  I&#x27;ll take a look at your project, but that website gives a horrible first impression.  Try to make your text <i>text</i>.

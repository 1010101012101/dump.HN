I recently watched a Noam Chomsky documentary, <a href=""http://video.google.com/videosearch?oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&q=Power+and+Terror:+Noam+Chomsky&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei=bwggS9ylBsiUtge0mOmxCg&sa=X&oi=video_result_group&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CBAQqwQwAA#oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&client=firefox-a&q=Power+and+Terror%3A+Noam+Chomsky&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei=bwggS9ylBsiUtge0mOmxCg&sa=X&oi=video_result_group&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CBAQqwQwAA&qvid=Power+and+Terror%3A+Noam+Chomsky&vid=6909612995471559345"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.google.com/videosearch?oe=utf-8&rls=org.moz...</a>, in which when discussing the history of social activism he made the point that the post WWII era up to the 60's was anomalous and that we are now settling back to business as usual. It is may be that this is true of many other activities.<p>If we look at Victorian Era science it was rife theories and notions that were scientifically somewhat mainstream, Phrenology, Spiritualism, ..., that we now consider pseudoscience. It is possible that some of the points raised in this article may be contemporary manifestation of what will in time become pseudoscience.<p>I think it more likely that we are seeing th normal state of science not the decline.",1260392364

The vulnerability of initial assumptions is a problem for any form of inquiry, science included, but it isn't a fatal problem.

It affects your sexual life, hence it affects your personal life as well. A pregnant woman with an herpes outbreak is endangering her baby. There's a very good reason society's morals have evolved towards condemning promiscuity. The sex revolution only happened a few decades ago because of penicilin and antibiotics. Sure, many people carry the HSV without even knowing it, but that does not mean it's OK to have it. And, as you know, it is known that HPV causes cancer, so I don't think it's OK to carry it as well.<p>In the end, the only truly safe sex is masturbation, but that's not a life option I recommend to anyone. When teenagers are educated on sex via porn movies, promoting safe sex is the responsible thing to do. If the no-condom movies went underground, then one could ban them. Or rate them as akin to child porn, and hence, illegal.<p>In any case, if there are people willing to pay for no-condom porn, then the world is sicker than I imagined in my worst nightmares...",1260389960

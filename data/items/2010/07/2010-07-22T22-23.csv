1539803,comment,1536356,1537244,0,0,Mz,,,"<i>you've traded away most of the peace of mind that comes with obliviousness in exchange for an unquantifiable reduction in hassles.</i><p>There is some truth to that.  I do, at times, fret too much. So there is some cost in terms of peace of mind.  However, even though I cannot prove to other people that there is a cause and effect relationship (between my actions and specific outcomes) and even though the reduction in hassles cannot be quantified with exactitude, that doesn't mean I cannot quantify it sufficiently to conclude that the benefit is well worth the cost.<p>For example:  My divorce was amicable and there were no lawyers.  IIRC, the average cost of a divorce lawyer when and where I got divorced was $18,000.  No, I can't know if I ""would"" have spent $5000 or $18,000 or $40,000.  I can know that I saved thousands of dollars on lawyers fees by having an amicable divorce.  I am also very certain that it benefited me by more than that:  I got thousands more from my husband than I was legally entitled to.  My husband was not a wealthy man.  After paying lawyers, there wouldn't have been that much to fight over. (He had a job, we had a bunch of debts and some household possessions.)  I have every reason to believe that the approach I took was all to the good.  Can I prove that to skeptics beyond a shadow of a doubt?  No.  Can I measure it with a high degree of confidence for my own peace of mind?  <i>Yes.</i>",1279839415

No attempt at solving any possible problems with exceeding Fair Use, just an out of state Federal lawsuit for $75,000 (the minimum you can sue for this kind of thing).  Like the RIAA it would appear that in their legal strategy they're entirely focused on getting small settlements that aren't so small for the bloggers and other small organizations they are suing (in one case, they're suing one of the newspaper's own primary sources for a story! <a href=""http://chanceofrain.com/2010/05/review-journal-sues-its-own-source/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chanceofrain.com/2010/05/review-journal-sues-its-own-...</a> Which puts the newspaper in an impossible position to continue reporting on the story.)<p>In the case I'm familiar with this isn't clear cut and economically damaging copyright infringement like with the RIAA's lawsuits, just excerpts of 6 stories.  If taken all the way to trial and judgment the damages would be de minimus, but who can afford to fight a Federal lawsuit for these sorts of stakes in another state?<p>Perhaps worse, look at the end example in the article where the defendant claims the proper venue is the DMCA since the possibly infringing material was submitted by a user.

Multitasking made stuff a bit snappier again, until you have too many apps open, then you have to manually kill them for some reason.

Maybe it has to do with the cache-size of apps that stay in memory, which is a bit too big to fit in the 3G's 128mb RAM?<p>This could also improve things: doing a hard reboot (holding home + lock until it reboots - don't slide to power off) and when +- 15 seconds in the reboot process (with the apple on the screen), hard reboot again. I saw someone suggest that this would clear all saved app states and speed up things too.

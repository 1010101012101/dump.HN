4606338,comment,4606047,4606047,25,0,molmalo,,,"I think that an important distinction has to be made about this kind of people. Unlike many journalists, and 'futurists' out there, trying to predict what the future will be like, people like Jobs and Gates[1] do not make bold predictions, just for the sake of making them. Instead they have a vision and they work to make that vision real.<p>That's the reason of why, when they speak, sometimes the things they tell may seem to be a little bit odd at the time, but eventually that things became real.<p>There are a few examples of this in the interview made by AllThingsD to Gates and Jobs together in 2007. [1] At 35:30 Gates said that he was sure the tablet market was about to explode (while jobs was looking at him with a funny poker face), and later, he basically described Kinnect, a few years before Project Natal was made public.<p>If Google haven't revealed Glass or their autonomous cars, and Larry or Sergey came out speaking about driver-less cars, and wearable devices, some would think that they are dreaming, but the truth is that they are describing their vision, and they are working to make it real.<p>It's like what jobs said at min 43, when asked about 5 years from 2007 (yeah, right now!). And he said: ""I don't know, "" [...] ""but something comes along, gets really popular, people love it, get used to it, you want it on there"".<p>They are not wizards, they happen to know what currently exists, and what's being developed. So, instead of making weird assumptions (like: ""ok, assuming that we will develop a material 1000 times stronger, 100 times lighter and 10 times cheaper, we'll have X in ten years""), they rationalize about what's the logical evolution of the technology, based on what they know.<p>[1] <a href=""http://allthingsd.com/video/?video_id=60C4F9FA-9AD5-4D04-8BB6-015AEBB1C052"" rel=""nofollow"">http://allthingsd.com/video/?video_id=60C4F9FA-9AD5-4D04-8BB...</a> , Min 28 and forward.",1349250753

A large amount of PHP documentation provides context in which you may effectively implement a piece of code by providing ""sufficient"" examples. A grenade I can almost guarantee you probably comes with documentation, but probably a warning which states when you pull the pin, it will blow up. PHP will not blow up the world, or blow your hands off. The documentation does not have to be ""perfect"". PHP has changed  web development in many positive ways, by increasing what could be done via simplicity using what you might call poor documentation. It has sufficed enough that good developers found it sufficient to build large complex code-bases which they could both build on and make money from. Much of MSDN library is created from internal comment-style documentation automation(JavaDoc,PHPDoc, XML Comments). MSDN will often times lack easily readable code-samples, and provide enough context in which you may actually use a library. Just because you define a prototype with long naming conventions doesn't mean Joe schmuck has a clue. PHP examples are generally not obtuse, or obfuscated to newbies. It's the ""I'm going to show you how to hunt fish"" and nobody said it had to be pretty. MSDN has gotten better over the years, but there are still many areas in the many libraries hosted on there which don't have ""even good enough"" documentation to help you to the most basic things.",1349249798

Have a way to increase the potential customer lifetime value much more than the $35-ish price - e.g. 1-on-1 classes for more money. Who is the type of customer who would pay you e.g. $200-500 for a lesson? What do they <i>need</i>?

Currencies die that way - they increase in value when they are traded, i.e. transacted in. A high ratio of buy-and-hold investors to merchant activity in a currency is a sign of speculative build-up. Paradoxically, the attractiveness of a currency to trade in is partially a function of how well it holds value - price level volatility bodes badly for that cause.<p>As a financial market participant, yes, it is surprising that the Bitcoin market stabilised as quickly as it did since it suggests there was an influx of asset and currency owners willing to trade their value into Bitcoins despite the risk of rapidly losing that value in price level volatility. Having examined some AML flow of funds data I can say this resilience has nothing to do with the zeal of the Bitcoin community, which in terms of wealth is insignificantly tiny, and everything to do with its adoption in trades deemed, shall we say, unsavoury by the world's legal authorities. As a supporter of further sophistication in the Bitcoin markets myself, this sentiment of seeing nothing awry in the Bitcoin/USD volatility is worrying, though the faith expressed in the currency is reassuring (these are, after all, fiat currencies).",1349249248

4606227,comment,4604555,4605312,2,0,rybosome,,,"The constant LANGUAGE_NONE represents the value 'und'. Yes, using the value directly rather than the constant is bad practice, and certainly is not idiomatic in any language; I'll concede that point to you.<p>Regarding the use of field_get_items, check the documentation on the return value:  ""An array of field items keyed by delta if available, FALSE otherwise."" Per my requirement of getting a single, OPTIONAL field value, field_get_items might return false, which means we are still looking at something like this overly verbose code:<p>($first_name = field_get_items('node', $person, 'first_name')) ? array_shift($first_name) : '';<p>Lastly, ""you want a formatter, a whole display mode, etc. You very rarely need that level of plumbing"". One of the requirements for this project was that each page represented by a person node would have a very specific layout. This meant that I couldn't rely on Drupal's default layout (even with formatters there was too much baked-in HTML that was unacceptable), and had to create a node--person.tpl.php file, i.e. a custom template.",1349248206

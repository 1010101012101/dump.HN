Funnily enough, a lot of the uptake of Go has been from former users of Python, Ruby, and other dynamic languages; they attracted to Go's simplicity, safety, and speed.<p>But really there's a lot more to Go the faulty dichotomy of ""dynamic vs static"" (or Python vs C, whatever).

The deployed versions of WebKit differ quite significantly across the myriad of mobile devices on the market, and WebKit is just the layout engine anyway. It doesn't run JS or talk directly to the network stacks, and it isn't responsible for any GPU acceleration that may or may not be available.<p>If you're doing anything more complicated than serving static HTML and images to mobile devices you will already need to test on as many different devices as is feasible for you. It's basically unheard of for something to work across all WebKit based browsers just because your CI is telling you it works OK in desktop Chrome.",1365071392

Your experience of something, even if similar to the experience of many others, is unique and cannot be reproduced within the constraints of social media. So internalise that experience instead. Think about it. Go home and think about it some more. Write about it in more than 140 characters; on paper even. Paint a picture of it. Talk about it face to face with your friends. Talk about how it made you feel.<p>I think this is precisely backwards. Social media sharing enhances my experience rather than detracting from it, precisely because it is so artless: I'm not thinking about how to describe where I am or what it looks like, I just check in or send a photo.

This is one reason why the &#x27;antenna&#x27; inside one of those old fashioned AM receivers is actually a coil with a ferrite core (and conveniently internal to the device), and an FM radio (the A/F have to do with the modulation, not specifically with the frequency but the bands are between 455 and 1600 KHz vs 88-108 MHz) typically uses a rod antenna.<p>Now you could make an FM radio with a coil for its antenna or an AM radio using a rod but neither would be very efficient.<p>So it&#x27;s the small distance and low frequency of RFID technology that drive the choice for magnetic coupling, whereas the high frequency and longer distances of WiFi make the choice for antennas.<p>AM radio, with its low frequency and <i>enormous</i> power output allows magnetic pick-up at very large distances from the point of origin, this is also why it is not &#x27;line-of-sight&#x27; but WiFi <i>is</i> line-of-sight (yes, you can bounce radio waves off objects (such as the moon or the Heavyside layer) but that&#x27;s another subject entirely).<p>The higher the frequency of operation the more you&#x27;ll be looking at properties resembling those of light (which is also a form of electromagnetic radiation).",1448031557

People with only the basic gist of &quot;Economics 101&quot; fail to understand that supply and demand economics <i>do not apply to the housing market</i> the way they do for consumer goods.<p>In a nutshell, hyper-inflation of rents in a metro area actually decreases the rate at which new units are built.  Landlords have incentive to keep supply down; and when they do build &quot;nice new&quot; units for <i>rent</i>, those rent prices increase the average rents on the market.<p>In a sense, landlords are able to bully renters into being &quot;customers&quot; for longer period of time. Harms middle-class housing in two ways:<p><pre><code>  (1) larger portion of renters&#x27; income dumped into\n  rent decreases ability to save for down-payment to buy\n\n  (2) fewer people buying decreases rate at which new\n  units are built, and thus never allows the &quot;housing\n  supply&quot; to react to actual market realities.\n</code></pre>\nAnd what causes hyperinflation in rents?

If you&#x27;re a user and you are used to Yahoo or Altavista but you hear about this new Google search, you can easily check out Google search and start comparing how it works relative to your usual experiences.  If you like Google search better, you just start using Google search as your primary engine.  Done.<p>If you had been user@yahoo.com for years and hear about Gmail, you open a Gmail account, start sending and receiving email as user@gmail.com and if you prefer the new service, you set up forwarding on your user@yahoo.com account and tell friends and family to use the Gmail address.  Done.<p>If you had been using Safari and hear about Chrome, you download Chrome and use it for a few days.  If you prefer your old Firefox setup you leave Chrome installed or ditch it but if you like Chrome, you just start using Chrome.  Done.<p>But social networking isn&#x27;t the same as email or a browser or a search engine.  It&#x27;s about communication like email but unlike email, you can&#x27;t just pick whatever social networking service you prefer and use it.  For social networking (at least in the typical Friendster/Myspace/Facebook way we usually think of it), you need <i>everyone</i> to be on the same service in order to communicate with them.  Switching services is a lot more work than switching a browser or a search engine and there&#x27;s no relatively easy &quot;patch&quot; like forwarding for email.  For a massive amount of people and orgs, Facebook was the first big social network that they invested their time in.  It was the first one that really got widespread adoption among people who may not really do much else on the web.  It was the one that your mom and your boss and your neighborhood association and your local bartender all joined.<p>And when G+ came along, plenty of people (myself included) checked it out because we like checking out new services and Google has put out several that are at least competitive if not definitive (gmail, search, chrome, maps, etc).  I won&#x27;t speak for everyone but I found it much nicer to use than Facebook.  There was no Farmville spam.  Sorting the contacts that were displayed on your feed or who saw your posts was much more granular and visual than Facebook.  The mobile app was much faster and more attractive.  It was already tied to your email, voice/video chat, calendar, and photo/video hosting if you had a Gmail account.  At the time, Facebook didn&#x27;t have a lot of these features.<p>But regardless of whether you liked it or hated it compared to Facebook, it turned out to be irrelevant.  Because unlike switching from Yahoo to Gmail or Firefox to Chrome, switching from Facebook to G+ wasn&#x27;t something that only depended on your interest and relative acceptance of change or effort.  Because unless all of your Facebook contacts did the same, it didn&#x27;t matter which you liked more.  The real limit of these kinds of services is that they&#x27;re not interoperable.  And if one (in this case, Facebook) gets a &quot;critical mass&quot; of users who might be resistant to change or switching services, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to succeed as a competitor.<p>The only real way it could succeed is by offering something other than Facebook (which is what they&#x27;re going for now I guess) but they will never be able to succeed as a <i>better</i> Facebook even if they build one.",1448030902

Our work environment is lacking in a lot of feedback and review; we&#x27;re often reporting to people who don&#x27;t work in our company and touchy-feely stuff is indirectly seen as unnecessary in this culture. Add that to the fact that we&#x27;re separated from the majority commercial IT world and there&#x27;s a sense of &quot;we&#x27;re just hacks&quot; and really don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re doing, we&#x27;re just her because of a lucky credential that gets us hired and riding the contracting gray train.<p>In trying to evaluate my skills absent feedback, I look to compare myself to those around me. And there, I&#x27;ve noticed, is dangerous territory. I need to state that what happens here, is not good, but it should be recognized. If I&#x27;m on a team of engineers and operations staff, building a system, I look around and see what others are doing. Did the configure something wrong that resulted in a fault? Someone screw up and dump too much on that datastore? &quot;Ha!&quot; I guiltly laugh. Because I knew not to do that, I must be better than them. And since, given I hold a very critical view of my own skills, if I&#x27;m simply average or &quot;getting by&quot;, then they must be really bad indeed.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s a terrible thing to think about one&#x27;s colleagues. There&#x27;s a danger in thinking that because one knows something, that knowledge must be common because to know something esoteric would be exceptional and therefor, better. Keeping with the narrative that we&#x27;re average, and knew it anyways, then it must be exceedingly simple and the other person should have known better. That&#x27;s not the case. We can know uncommon things. We can be deeper in our fields than we think.<p>The other fallacy of course is that it&#x27;s also a degree of confirmation bias. Everyone else&#x27;s failing below ours is a sign of their ineptitude. It assumes that our own mistakes wouldn&#x27;t have been caught in turn.<p>All of this I&#x27;m trying to illustrate is, impostor syndrome can be harmful to more than just ourselves when we fail to believe in our own abilities and at the same time, measuring ourselves against others.

There&#x27;s a bit of an unwritten rule to leave implementation details public that would be private in other languages. Many libraries simply don&#x27;t bother with prefixing privates with &#x27;_&#x27; and just leave things undocumented that you probably shouldn&#x27;t touch/use.<p>One notable example is importing libraries in your code automatically exposes them to the caller.<p><pre><code>    $ cat lib.py\n    import re\n    \n    def somefunc():\n        pass\n\n    $ python\n    >>> import lib\n    >>> lib.re\n    <module &#x27;re&#x27; from &#x27;/usr/lib/python2.7/re.pyc&#x27;>\n</code></pre>\nMany packages also do `import *` from files which polutes the package namespace with all kinds of stuff you really don&#x27;t want in there. For example, the popular Requests package:<p><pre><code>    >>> import requests\n    >>> requests.logging\n    <module &#x27;logging&#x27; from &#x27;/usr/lib/python2.7/logging/__init__.pyc&#x27;>\n</code></pre>\nThe logging module is not a public part of requests&#x27; API. It&#x27;s just there because requests uses it internally.<p>So to answer your question, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s just common practice. If it&#x27;s undocumented in Python, you should pretend it doesn&#x27;t exist.",1448030581

Everyone else will use it to slash and cut language barriers, doing real-time, face-to-face, cloud-based speech translation with augmented reality so you can talk to anyone, anytime, without any barriers. Indoor maps and navigation will become a reality, superimposed over our vision, telling us when and where to go so we aren&#x27;t late, informing us of dangers, and educating us about the world around us. Self-driving robots, cars, and other gadgets will rely on constant, reliable bandwidth, and link to our calendar management services and travel planners so they can just show up without us actually even having to open an app to call them. Health monitoring devices will tell us based on cloud-based services if we encounter foods that contain allergens, and constantly update their data and firmware.<p>A paywall that causes even 60 seconds of interruption to this flow of data is going to throw off this technological dream.

Obviously the size, age and (development) leadership in companies would determine exactly how &quot;excellent&quot; released code could be. My career has mostly been as web (application) developer at small companies that had a priority other than &quot;highly skilled developers.&quot; The priority was usually &quot;a complete web site that functioned.&quot; Whatever ugly, un-reviewed code that made it into that released product was fine, as long as it &quot;functioned.&quot; None of these places included code-review as part of the release process, so there&#x27;s zero chance of preventing code being released that wasn&#x27;t written with full understanding.<p>Personally, I only came in contact with the term &quot;closure&quot; rather recently. Scope was something I intuitively understood since my early days as a coder, and read about. This is the good and bad of being completely self-taught in most respects. There was no linear escalation of education to hold my hand through each and every concept. I would try code that I felt would work. Usually it would. Was it elegant, self-contained, de-coupled? Nope, not at all. But it functioned.",1448028164

I can&#x27;t recommend this book strongly enough particularly if there are mental health issues in your life -- and who doesn&#x27;t!<p>Dr Ratey references and describes a number of experiments and studies done in elementary  schools where mental acuity improved across the population when exercise was added. One fascinating detail was the immediacy of the effect. I&#x27;d be very surprised if the most recent data is not consistent with the results described in Spark.",1448028109

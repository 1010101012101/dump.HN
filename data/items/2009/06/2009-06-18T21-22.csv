There's a reason why big companies tend towards bureaucracy and inefficiency. It's not that the people in the company are stupid, but rather that as a company grows larger, the actions that are in the best interest of the individual increasingly diverge from the actions that are in the best interest of the company. While I agree that the soul-crushing, morality-corrupting experience of working at a large company will teach you many things that are essential to an entrepreneur later down the line, I think you would be better served developing some individuality and backbone through college or the yc experience. Both options will give you a chance to experience what it really means to make your own decisions and to sink or swim by them (assuming you are not living at home for college).",1245361745

As a result, it'd be tastier and healthier (?), and thus more appealing.<p>That's not to say that there aren't risks, and that sometimes the costs outweigh the benefits, but to condemn genetic or hormone manipulation on the basis of it being <i>manipulation</i> just seems silly.

If I were coming up with an admittedly vague rule-of-thumb off the top of my head, I think the line would be speech advocating or intended to likely lead to the immediate harm of any individual or group would not fall under protected speech.<p>And, looking it up on wikipedia, it seems that there is indeed already a set of guidelines. John Stuart Mill introduced ""the harm principle"":<p><i>""John Stuart Mill argued that ""...there ought to exist the fullest liberty of professing and discussing, as a matter of ethical conviction, any doctrine, however immoral it may be considered.""...However, Mill also introduced what is known as the harm principle, in placing the following limitation on free expression: ""the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.""</i><p>Makes sense to me, and should be used as the guiding principle.

664140,comment,663864,664105,0,0,mquander,,,"Well, my comment was meant to distinguish between your examples of quality and other metrics of utility.  You gave the example of popular singers, and popular singers might not be the ""best singers"" in the sense of musical quality, but they entertain a lot of people a great deal. The unnammed woman who stirred up an online community got a lot of traffic, and she might not be well-liked, but clearly she provoked a lot of discussion and interest (if only rubbernecking entertainment sort of interest) among people linking to her and reading articles about her, so there's an element of usefulness in what she did.<p>You say that Google's idea is ""...that if a lot of people cite you, you must be on to something.""  I'd refine this to say that if a lot of people cite you, you must be providing some kind of thing that those people value.<p>My thoughts on your $20 scenario --<p>- I think part of the problem here is that an offer like that on the internet isn't very credible.  If I were reading that page, I would be unlikely to actually get 20 dollars, because I probably wouldn't take it seriously enough to email you.  As a result, that page isn't really very useful in a certain practical sense.<p>- If you were able to make it credible somehow, and even one person stumbled across the page, emailed you, and received 20 dollars, I bet that you would get a very large amount of readers very fast.  If your page was accessible to search engines, I suspect that you might get that one person (and a later flood of people once word spread) without any promotion at all, eventually.",1245359170

Thanks to an endowment from an alumni, I have a free subscription to magazines such as Inc. and Small Business, an all-inclusive trip to an Entrepreneurship conference once a year, and access to a center for entrepreneurship that provides counseling and training from experienced professionals. If anything, my degree provides me resources similar to what is offered at YC (without the prestige, quality, and seed funding).",1245359099

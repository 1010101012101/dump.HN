8608084,comment,8604814,8606258,0,0,polybius,,,"Yes. Here’s a slapdash translation of the other paragraphs, using a lot of rusty French and a little Google Translate. Let me know if there&#x27;s anything to correct.<p>- - -<p>When I finally made contact with the mathematical world at Paris, one or two years later, I ended up learning, among a lot of other things, that the work that I had done in my area with the means at hand, was (pretty much) something well known to &quot;everybody&quot;, under the names of measure theory and of Lebesgue integrals. To the eyes of the two or three seniors to whom I had spoken of this work (or even shown a manuscript), it was a little as if I had simply wasted my time, by re-doing that which was &quot;already known&quot;. I do not recall having been disappointed, before. At that moment, the idea of collecting &quot;credit&quot;, be it the praise or let alone the interest of others, for the work that I was doing, would have been foreign to my spirit, still. Besides, my energy was well enough spent in familiarizing myself with a completely different milieu, and, more, learning that which was considered at Paris the equivalent of a B.A. in mathematics.<p>However, in thinking back now on those three years, I realize they were in no way wasted. Without even knowing it, I had learned in solitude that which was essential to the mathematician&#x27;s work - that which no teacher, truly, could teach. Without ever having it said to me, without having met anyone with whom to share my thirst for <i>knowing</i> things, I was, however, aware, &quot;in my gut&quot;, I would say, that I was a mathematician : someone who &quot;did&quot; math, in the full sense of the term - like you &quot;make&quot; love. Mathematics was becoming for me a mistress always welcoming of my desire. Those years of solitude had formed the basis of a confidence which has never been shaken - neither by the discovery (disembarking in Paris at the age of 20 years) of the whole extent of my ignorance and of the immensity of that which it would be necessary to learn : neither (more than 20 years later) by the uproar of my leaving for good the mathematical world ; neither, in these last years, by the frequently pretty crazy events of a certain kind of &quot;burial&quot; (anticipated and painless) of my person and my work, orchestrated by my closest friends of old. . .<p>- - -<p>[other paragraphs; see above]<p>- - -<p>The infant, <i>he</i> has no difficulty being alone. He is alone by nature, even if occasional company doesn’t displease him and he knows to reach for his mother’s breast, when it’s time to drink. He knows well, without having had it said to him, that the breast is for him, and that he knows how to drink. But often, we have lost contact with that infant in us. And constantly we pass next to better things, without deigning to see. . .<p>If in these <i>Récoltes et Semailles</i> I address myself to someone other than myself, it’s not to the &quot;public&quot;. I address myself to you, who reads me as one person, and to one person alone. It’s to them, and you, who know how to be alone, to the infant, that I would like to speak, and to other people. The infant is often far away, I know it well. There, he’s seen all the colors, for ages and ages. He’s hidden God knows where, and it is easy, often, to stumble upon him. You would swear he’s been dead since forever, that he had never existed at all - but I am sure that he’s there sometimes, and very much alive.<p>And I know also what the sign is, when I’ve been heard. It’s when, despite all the differences of culture and destiny, that which I’ve said about my person and life finds echo and resonance in you ; when you also find there your proper life, your proper experience of yourself, on a day on which you were not, perhaps, giving attention to it. It doesn’t mean anything along the lines of &quot;identification&quot;, to something or someone distant from you. But maybe, a little, that you rediscover <i>your</i> proper life, that which is closest to <i>you</i>, in going over the rediscovery that I did of mine, through the pages in <i>Récoltes et Semailles</i>, and up to these pages that I am in the process of writing even today.",1415983838

Often there are huge &quot;chunks&quot; missing where lines died out or went their separate ways. We arbitrarily declare that such-and-such collection of organisms between this point and that point on the continuum are a distinct species. Sometimes, this species can interbreed with another and even have fertile offspring, but they just don&#x27;t - even if they live in the same locale! Sometimes two species are even more genetically similar than the first example, but they can&#x27;t interbreed at all. Sometimes two organisms could interbreed, but it&#x27;s physically impossible for some reason (very small dogs and very large dogs) without some kind of assistance. Sometimes they can, but the offspring is not fertile. And as you get further and further away on the continuum, the less likely they can interbreed at all.

8608020,comment,8605978,8607322,0,0,pm90,,,"While there is a great demand, hiring people is actually a lot more complicated than most would-be employees have an idea of. If you&#x27;re not from the same country (as you seem to be implying), it is even more problematic. The thing is, most employers are anal about hiring the right kind of person because an employee represents a significant investment: not only do you have to pay for his/her benefits, but also he/she will be writing code that will go into their infrastructure, and they want to be really really sure that the person is good.<p>Now, how do employers find this kind of person? One way is to go to well known universities; most US universities have recruiting events that are chock-filled with tech companies; and this is by far the best place to get a great entry-level position. Once you work at a known company for even a little while, that experience is a signal to other companies (and recruiters) that you are someone who is hireable and they will then actively pursue you. That is the impression that I got, and it has fairly matched with my personal experience.<p>Outside of university recruiting events, I think your best shot is Meetups. There will definelty be some of those in any city, go there. Introduce yourself, ask questions, learn news stuff and talk to people. I know this is really really hard for a lot of people with an academic background who tend to be rather shy. But hey, you want to work for a great company with the nice pay and benefits, then  you have to step outside your comfort zone.<p>I cannot over-emphasize the need for networking for advancing your career.",1415983334

I&#x27;ve had the displeasure of working with some of these guys. They have some paper certs and some basic understanding of what they&#x27;re doing but they have zero big picture and any love of what they are doing.  Don&#x27;t get me started on their work from a security or stability perspective.  These guys are just in the wrong field. They heard the siren&#x27;s song of being a coder, did some coding bootcamp or took a community college class or two, and are shoved into big departments churning out junk code.<p>I think these jobs echo how a lot of basic IT support staff in the late 90s and early 2000s got work. Companies were scrambling for someone to sit down with end users and explain how Outlook worked, install software, and maybe reboot the occasional server.  These guys all ran to braindump sites, got a MCSE or CCNA, and now are lifers at the company they fooled into hiring them.<p>There&#x27;s something somewhat sad about all this.  These people probably would have been better off in a different field but are now stuck in unpromotable positions because they just don&#x27;t have what it takes to move up.

The mirror mechanism&#x27;s speed is limited by the strength and flexibility of its materials (too fast and it&#x27;ll break), and the power level of the actuator moving it. Not to mention the faster you move the mirror the more slap you will get, causing vibrations in the camera that affect image quality. There is a &quot;limit of physics and material science&quot; problem inherent in SLRs.<p>A mirrorless camera has none of these disadvantages - and it shows, even the vaunted Canon 1D has a shutter lag between 40-50ms depending on model, while the Sony NEX-5N has a shutter lag of 22ms.<p>The Canon 7D lordbusiness brings up clocks in at ~70ms. In fact none of Canon&#x27;s DSLRs can get below 40ms.<p>The Olympus E-M1 comes in at 50ms, as is the Fuji X-T1. Mirrorlesses already outperform even high-end DSLRs when it comes to shutter lag.

8607760,comment,8606860,8607130,0,0,htns,,,"Back when this was happening it was big news because the Swedish military didn&#x27;t really hide they were searching for a submarine in an enclosed bay. In the end they didn&#x27;t catch anything, so this could be seen as an embarrassment for them whether or not there really was a sub.<p>The political side is that Sweden is not in NATO, as the electorate sees NATO as too global and too likely to draw the country into remote conflicts or the next world war. Russia is the only remotely plausible military threat in the region, so it&#x27;s the bogeyman NATO will have to use if it wants to lure Sweden in. This incident will be used to argue the Swedish military is inadequate on its own. On the other hand Russia is testing everyone&#x27;s military capabilities, e.g. Russian planes routinely skirt US airspace. In the 80&#x27;s Sweden had lots of similar incidents (as well as confirmed ones: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_submarine_incidents"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_submarine_incidents</a>), and those didn&#x27;t drive Sweden to join NATO. However Swedish society has become a lot less militant since then, abolishing conscription and reducing military budgets, and the memory of Sweden faring splendidly through WWII by staying independent is not as fresh. Eventually Sweden may end up in NATO solely because there isn&#x27;t political will to do anything else.<p>If Sweden were to join NATO that could have implications for the neighboring Finland, which isn&#x27;t in NATO either but still has conscription. Finland is the buffer between Sweden and Russia, so it is a given Finland would have an independent Sweden&#x27;s backing.<p>Another thing is that there&#x27;s much trade between Finland and Russia, and it&#x27;s certainly old hat in Finland to fish for benefits by being the one European country that&#x27;s not overtly russophobic. Finland even has much Russian military equipment.<p>Also, this video: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B19kYo80yec"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B19kYo80yec</a> , though I don&#x27;t really remember its backstory. (The RT article linked in the description seems to be reporting on a Swedish site reporting on that video, and the link to the Swedish site is broken.)

But to use the word &#x27;bandit state&#x27; - I think it&#x27;s a bit more complicated than that.<p>To me, a bandit state echoes a temporary institution that is held up mostly through the use and threat of direct violence. To my eyes elements of the current status harken to a russian tzardom hundreds of years back.<p>Strong autocratic leaders have always been a part of the political apparatus and the fatalistic psyche of the population drive individuls to yield, survive and pour their energies to something else than politics. It is also notable that russia is a typical country suffering from the curse of oil which itself is empirically a really hard thing to avoid or heal from which twists the dynamics even further.<p>I would suggest three brief bodies of text to explore the problem of russia to those who are not familiar with them:<p><a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse</a><p>Kennan&#x27;s long telegram:\n<a href=""http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/coldwar/documents/episode-1/kennan.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/coldwar/documents/episode-1/ke...</a><p>And thirdly, a bit longer work that reads like an autobiographic surrealist version of Catch-22, a description of the soviet system which trained most of those now in power (Suvorov:&quot;Inside the soviet military&quot;): <a href=""http://militera.lib.ru/research/suvorov12/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://militera.lib.ru/research/suvorov12/index.html</a>",1415980953

Our methods can achieve much better results than interpolation based approaches (example: https://www.dropbox.com/s/74duixpek7fxhl4/superResolution.png?dl=0).<p></i>Image/Video Depth of Field Adjustment - Our algorithm is able to estimate depth information from and adaptively apply filters to emulate different depth of field - effectively allowing for a clip captured with a smartphone to look like it was shot with a different lens (example: https://www.dropbox.com/s/7qhfgnwl08vtk63/compare.png?dl=0).<p>We’re intending to eventually make as many state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms available as possible and would love your feedback on the kinds of image/video processing tasks that you would want to be able to use.<p>Would you find this a useful tool?

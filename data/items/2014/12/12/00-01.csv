Yet, someone 150lbs heavier than me, same age, sex, etc. is much more likely to have health problems yet pays the same premium.<p>In other words, there is the perception that those who chose to create these problems aren&#x27;t bearing the cost themselves, all of us are being forced to foot the bill.",1418345976

Ironically, the consistency of Perl&#x27;s syntax in those days (vs having to remember awk, sed, and other somewhat overlapping tools, each with its own awkward syntax) made it an amazingly convenient super-tool for stream processing.

Full-text search isn&#x27;t super-handy. Searching by musical phrase would be nice, but very hard to make user-friendly. If it automatically parsed out the title and composer that&#x27;d also be cool (especially when I upload a 64-tune collection), but from a ML perspective that&#x27;s not entirely easy.<p>I wish the website remembered my login.<p>For my taste the upload form is too cutesy. The faux iPad is a bit much (and makes the site seem very tablet-centric, when in fact it works fine in any browser), there&#x27;s a lot of real estate devoted to each file and yet somehow they look cluttered, showing PDF in huge letters isn&#x27;t really necessary when the file extension is shown (and the hover effect makes it seem clickable when it&#x27;s not), and most importantly there&#x27;s no obvious way to exit the form—it was a leap of faith to just go to a new page and assume everything had been uploaded correctly. Also, &quot;Remove file&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to work—files removed from the upload form (that had already been uploaded) still show up in my library. And then there&#x27;s no way to delete them from the Web UI.<p>---<p>I realize I have a specific use case, but the ideal for me would be to snap a picture of a tune I have in a music book, have your OCR magic autofill the title and composer, and let me slap some tags on it.

The difference is that, while felonies are notionally more serious crimes with more at risk, defendants actually have the right to be represented at present evidence at preliminary hearings, while they are entitled to neither for grand jury proceedings. (And that preliminary hearings are before a judge, rather than a grand jury.)<p>So, the alternative to grand juries doesn&#x27;t give prosecutors more power, it gives them less.

Now, the UK, Japan, the police may not be any nicer but they have the privilege of correctly presuming suspects are unarmed.<p>As Americans i don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll get to a place where arms are well regulated, so I think other options will be necessary.  Training in defusing confrontations, perhaps sending in officers in exoskeletons and armor.  Something which allows for the suspect to actually intend harm but unable to execute on the officer.  That way police don&#x27;t feel they have to err on the side of safety given the propensity of arms in The US.<p>The police are trained to neutralize a suspect rather than &quot;wing&quot; them.  I think it has to do with how &quot;baddies&quot; can have actual firearms whereas in many other countries firearms are heavily regulated for the general pop.<p>In any event, the police and the general pop need to be able to feel more at ease with each other otherwise we&#x27;ll be on our way to judge dredd and that&#x27;s not a good path.",1418345219

I also wouldn&#x27;t compare a Swiss canton to a US state - Switzerland in total is about as large and about as populated as an average US state - which is true for most\n many European contries. So IMO it&#x27;s a better comparison to just look at Europe as a whole and you&#x27;ll probably find much more regulatory grind for the carriers. And yes, of the three Swiss carriers only one is domestic only, so the others deal with this vast landscape of regulations just fine.<p>So to conclude I don&#x27;t see how regulations are the problem - the US with a more centralistic system than <i>Europe</i> as a whole should do better there. My suspicion is that <i>because</i> the US regulations can be influenced at the federal level, it&#x27;s just much easier for Big Corp. to pour lots of money into lobbying to get their way. In European countries you (a) don&#x27;t get as much ROI and (b) the political system doesn&#x27;t lend itself as much to it because there is a more diverse party landscape in almost all European nations, so you would have to deal with more people to get a majority. This is why I think that the US needs two things politically:<p>1) a switch to a more proportional election system in order to break gerrymandering and the two-party system.<p>2) decentralisation for industry regulations.<p>Both these would lead to more difficult lobbying and it has better political representation as a nice &#x27;side effect&#x27;.",1418345147

Set up and aiming IR sensors takes more time than writing the &quot;program&quot; for misterhouse.  The inevitable labor expense of troubleshooting and fine tuning is huge.  This is the main limiter for my own home automation.  In the long run controlling my tropical fish tank and the security sensor lights that light the walk from my garage to the house pays off.  My hallway to the bathroom doesn&#x27;t pay off for labor.  I hooked up the basement door sensor and got it to work and still haven&#x27;t hooked up or automated the basement stairs light yet.

If anything, this speaks to a failure to be self-critical more than a surplus of outward negativity.<p>More generally, I&#x27;m frustrated by what I see as an increasing tendency of people to parse the world into &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot;.

Not being ACID doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;none of the above&quot;, and atomicity in an embedded database is practically a footnote in a distributed system anyway, because you&#x27;re looking for atomicity on a much grander scale. You can impose whatever locking strategy you want around the memory to ensure updates are atomically visible. It&#x27;s an embedded DB so consistency is in the hands of the application logic.

I'm a Ruby guy and I've looked at Python several times and it never really stuck (I could work on a project that use Python, it just wouldn't be as fun as a project using Ruby to me). I could complain about various technical details, but if I'm entirely honest it would just be minute, meaningless, bitchy detail nitpicks.",1219417176

That way, the diode effectively reads the toast temperature rather than color, which would address the issues you mention. But I was a bit worried that the infrared emission of the heating coils would swamp that of the toast.<p>For my original design, you'd definitely have to set the control to only slightly darker than your rye bread, or you'd get burned rye toast.",1219417043

Among my own circle of friends, it's surprising how neatly we (well, those of us who use either language) divide into those categories.

And the process of creating something - it is usually a nice feeling to be able to build something tangible  from scratch (a blank editor screen). No, I don't see myself programming forever.<p>As an old programmer told me once, the most qualified programmers are usually the ones who are not programming. When you first come out of school and/or first start programming, you are young and excited and eager to learn the latest/coolest technology. After several projects and/or years of experience, you start to realize it's not about the technology - there are commonalities/patterns. And maybe after that point (when you start to become uber efficient and deadly) you start to think about transitioning out and getting married/starting a family..

283726,comment,283639,283639,0,0,raganwald,,,"They're both impressive, modern languages. What I find interesting when comparing Python to Ruby is how much Python isn't like Lisp. Matz has said outright that he considers Ruby to be ""MatzLisp"" and it shows, whereas Guido has absolutely no problem chucking Lispy things overboard--like multi-line anonymous functions--if they do not fit the rest of the language.<p>Instead, Python finds another way, like powerful list comprehensions that can be used wherever Ruby would use blocks and maps.<p>So I would say you can learn some very interesting things from either language, and there's a good chance they will be <i>different</i> interesting things.",1219416544

For example, the command line tool gen_bridge_metadata (supplied by Appleto make it possible to access system frameworks written in C from scripting languages) is itself a ruby script.  I notice that on Linux it's the reverse - python seems to be the preferred scripting language.<p>But don't take my comments as saying only ruby is supported on the Mac, or only python on Linux - in reality it's only a light preference one way or the other.",1219415545

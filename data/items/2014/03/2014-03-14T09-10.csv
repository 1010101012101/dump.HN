The real &quot;problem&quot; as I understand it is that some people get information sooner than others and can profit from it<p>That&#x27;s effectively describing the problem is a slightly reformulated way. HFT basically gives traders priority access to the market - they can receive outside information at the same time as you and just react to it quicker.<p>Moreover, they have priority access to information about how others in the market are behaving.<p>>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s possible to fix that, but one idea would be to do trades in discrete increments of a few seconds or whatever.<p>That simply changes the race from about being the quickest trader to being first in the queue during the increments.",1394790995

They do the trick for smaller databases, but are difficult to retroactively fit in as the OP mentions.<p>A great tip I also received once was to split migrations across releases when they are destructive. ie. if a column is to be removed, first release code that don&#x27;t use that column, if all okay, rename to column in the next release db migration, and if still ok, in a release later on actually delete the column. If this was done in one release and didn&#x27;t work your rollback would be difficult.<p>Other defensive actions e.g. when deleting rows of data, is to copy the affected data to a temporary table first before deleting it in the original table(s), and only in a later release when its proven you did not need to rollback should you delete the temporary table.<p>And if for some reason you don&#x27;t have any automated database versioning, at least create a versions table to manually keep track of changes and dates for some sort of sane auditing.",1394790783

It&#x27;s about preventing HFT operators from effectively levying a tax on the rest of the participants in the equities market (e.g. pensions and value investors).<p>>Reducing speculation increases price volatility<p>Absurd.

Well, they come from you. Specifically, large investors (pension funds), insurance companies, value investors, etc. Other participants in the market.<p>HFT takes money directly from pension funds who are executing large orders, by &#x27;skimming&#x27; off the orders they make. Their profits are not made out of thin air.<p>>So an FTT would indeed drive up costs for individual investors making the\n>critics correct on this very point then?<p>Nope. FTT is infinitesimally tiny % of a transaction. Unless you&#x27;re executing millions upon millions of transactions a day that&#x27;s an infinitesimally tiny amount. In which case you&#x27;re NOT an individual investor, you&#x27;re doing HFT... the exact kind of behavior this tax is intended to cut down on.<p>>Sigh. The argument is now that it‚Äôs not going to cost people very much\n>because we‚Äôve decided not to count that cost which is going to be the\n>largest for people.<p>Firstly, HFT WITHDRAWS liquidity precisely when it is needed the most. Most algos will freeze up during times of market distress. So yeah, they&#x27;re not helping when the markets are ACTUALLY suffering from a lack of liquidity.<p>Secondly, they&#x27;re adding trading volume, not liquidity. It was never hard to actually sell or buy a stock before HFT. They&#x27;re not cutting down on spreads (that&#x27;s what market makers do - and HFT is NOT market making).<p>When the markets are operating normally, they&#x27;re <i>already</i> very, very, very liquid (as was the case before HFT). HFT makes little to no difference.<p>HFT is basically legalized front running. It should be banned somehow because it is parasitic on the other participants in the equities market. The financial transactions would cut down on that, but don&#x27;t expect them to give up without a fight (as this guy is witness to).",1394790596

Now those factors are much less restricting than before, so everyone has their own indie game. ;) But that means there are many, many more games than the maximum number that can ever achieve significant sales and attention. So the new bottleneck is public attention, and the new king gatekeepers are the gaming media (including Penny Arcade, Let&#x27;s Players like Totalbiscuit and so on), who can direct the public&#x27;s attention to your game. So which players are ahead in the new game? Guys with gaming-media juice, either through having gaming-industry recognition or being ex-journalists themselves.

This industry was dominated by steam shovels until the 1920‚Äôs, when gasoline powered engines began to replace them. This was, however, not a disruptive innovation, but a sustaining one, even though the design of the machines changed radically from that of a steam-powered system of cables, to that of a gasoline engine driving a system to extend and retract the cable connected to the bucket. The new engines were more capable than the old ones, and were better at doing more work more reliably, and cheaper than the old system. Despite the radical change in the industry, the same firms that were strongest in steam shovels stayed on top. The disruptive change came with the introduction of hydraulic-actuated systems after World War II - a change that eliminated nearly all of the established players by about 1970, in favor of companies that entered the market with hydraulics. The first hydraulic-based excavators were less capable than the cable systems that were in existence, and certainly couldn‚Äôt compete with them. However, they were small enough that they could be deployed for jobs previously done by hand, opening up a new market, in which the desired attributes were quite different from the big jobs that the cable actuated excavators were used for. The technology involved in hydraulics continued to improve, however, and with time eventually equaled and then surpassed the needs formerly filled by cable-based systems. In the meantime, though, the established firms were still going strong, and didn‚Äôt do much, if anything, to deal with the new competitor (because it wasn‚Äôt really seen as a competitor, not being sufficient for their existing clients‚Äô demands) until the new arrivals were ‚Äúin the midst of their mainstream market‚Äù. By the time the established companies introduced their own hydraulics, however, it was too late, and the later entrants were by then better positioned with the new technology.<p>From <a href=""http://www.squeezedbooks.com/articles/the-innovators-dilemma-the-revolutionary-book-that-will-change-the-way-you-do-business-(collins-business-essentials)-summary.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.squeezedbooks.com/articles/the-innovators-dilemma...</a> - a site I sold on a few years ago.",1394789107

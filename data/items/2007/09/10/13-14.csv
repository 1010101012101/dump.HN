If the author is correct though, and the business really is a low margin headache, wouldn't it still be in their interest for Apple, Google, Microsoft, etc to set up some kind of joint venture to administer the network while they focus on their individual services?<p>I know it may be tough for them to work with their competitors like this, but it's better then being squeezed by and independent operator.",1189431978

However, the cost of a man-in-the-middle attack is usually higher than the content you are transferring <i>in most cases</i>.<p>For example, if I'm downloading sources of an open-source program from a public web site, what's the point of attacking me and changing the contents?<p>(And I have no idea why you were downmodded.)",1189431376

Things can still improve if the hardware configuration remains the same.<p>And I have no idea how long the trend for increased horsepower will continue.<p>My hope with my comment was to get away from prognostication and reducing a problem to a simple number. But perhaps one take away is that we should use a suite of real programs to test hardware configurations. Benchmark routines are pretty useless when  hardware optimizes for the routine, which has obviously been happening for years.<p>A seti-at-home style system that noted top and your system configuration would be useful. Deploy it to a few hundred computers and see how things perform in the aggregate with increasing quality hardware.",1189430850

If you could start a company with anyone in the world who would it be?<p>As a non-tech person I'd probably pick something who was strongly technical - most likely Steve Wozniak.",1173160571

For quite a while though it was the only language being commonly used that had first class functions where you could program in a functional way.<p>""'I thought JavaScript was just super-dumb Java'. Lots of programmers and web developers use Javascript this way, tweaking HTML DOM elements, declaring variables without types, and generally writing like it was BASIC for the web.

I suppose there is no need to restrict but I would say that as great as Woz is - would he really add more to your startup than an angel investing veteran like Ron Conway?  Investing is as much about bringing a list of contacts to the table as it is about anything else.",1173160401

2517,comment,2463,2468,0,0,jwecker,,,"Have two primary objectives with your startups- to get them stable, solve the big/fun problems etc., and secondly to replace yourself.  I know we're all irreplaceable, but the truth is a good businessman can find someone almost immediately to train and groom to take over whatever it is you're doing- releasing you to move onto the next thing.  You'll have finished most of the creative stuff that needed you.  Then you go back every 6 to 18 months when they have an exciting new problem and save their butts.",1173158887

It turned out to be a pretty frustrating and disheartening experience, but I learned a lot. After some time in NYC I just decided to come back to Massachusetts and really try and get my own ideas off the ground. My partner is 25 and rotting away at a repetitive flash development job. He's damn good at flash though haha

137159,comment,136759,136765,0,0,wheels,,,"Yeah, this is crap, and honestly, it's more typically French than German.<p>I suppose the political logic was something like, ""What's hot right now?  Google.  Why don't we have one?  Well, let's fix that.""<p>On the other side, doubly so in Berlin where I'm based, there is significant funding for startups available especially once they start creating jobs.  We're planning on tapping that once we get far enough in.  At least as best as I can judge, Berlin's one of the hot-spots for startups in Europe right now.",1205528073

137146,comment,136067,137002,0,0,apathy,,,"5 years?  If you count from when FSFS became the standard (2005?) it's really more like 3 years.  I think Subversion will probably remain the standard for your 'average' developer, and Git will make huge inroads into the more elite/distributed teams, since it's the default repo for the Linux kernel.  I don't really see the point of learning how to use tools that other developers are unlikely to use -- CVS, SVN (which is almost identical to Perforce), and git have compelling projects which use them.  Most others don't.<p>If you use SVN in a group, you should also use Trac, btw.  It's fucking amazing.  <i>looks at Trac Hacks</i>  Holy mother of god, someone went and wrote a plugin to make Trac play nice with Git and Perforce (AMZN and GOOG use p4).  Well, that's pretty sweet -- no effort required regardless of repo.  And apparently they added a continuous integration dashboard, Bitten (<a href=""http://bitten.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitten.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation/index.html</a>).  I love those Edgewall guys.  Makes me want to go back to workaday development... almost.",1205526927

137131,comment,135944,136305,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I don't use ActionScript classes.  Everything's done with closures and literal objects.  Can't even use prototypes; MTASC doesn't allow standalone functions or prototype declarations (instead <i>requiring</i> that everything live inside a class), so that falls outside the common subset.  We namespace things the way it's done in JavaScript, with objects serving as namespaces, so there's a notion of libraries that're imported at compile time.  My Scheme experience certainly comes in handy.<p>I haven't ruled out doing a mini-translator; this is very obviously a hack, and if the common codebase grows much larger we'll probably appreciate it.  (We've also considered rewriting the whole thing in pure Flash, but there're certain user benefits that the dual-language architecture gives us that we're not quite ready to give up.)  This approach is ""good enough"" for now though, so we're hoping that it'll get us to an initial launch, and then we can decide whether it needs a rewrite based on what users want to do with it.",1205525735

It's completely inaccessible to most people.<p>I don't understand the point you're trying to make with that article. Clarkson published his account details and challenged people to exploit it. If you gave the keys to your home to a burglar, what would you expect? The article does not say he was unable to recover his funds.<p>There must be dozens of ways for someone to steal your financial information. If you truly want to be safe, you should start by burning your trash, always pay in cash, and never hire an accountant to do your taxes. You never know where there's a leak. It's not practical to exercise this level of caution. Just live your life.

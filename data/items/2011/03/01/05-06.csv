So even if his shares, if converted, would only be a small percentage of the company, he may have effective veto power.<p>In the end you're counting on the decency and reputation of your investor(s) that they don't turn out to be the kind of people who think, ""can I squeeze a few more bucks out of this deal if I'm willing to blow it up, and don't care what people think of me?"" (Or even if, in the investor's real peer group, he can tell it as an impressive war story of his negotiating prowess.)<p>It'll be dressed up as something else – ""I'm not receiving a proper premium for my preferred privileges!"" – but is really just a bet that their toughness/ambivalence can force other shareholders to cave.<p>I suspect it's a more likely tactic with investors whose background is in other older, and more zero-sum industries. (The similar experience I mentioned in my other comment was with someone from the government-granted telecom franchise field.)",1298959154

Unfortunately, yield is a Javascript 1.7 extension for now, but there's hope for it in ES Harmony.<p>Anyway, with generators and promises you can write asynchronous code which looks like synchronous code but which under the covers is still completely async and callback-driven.  We use it in gjs (a GNOMEy JS runtime built on top of Spidermonkey).<p>Instead of workflows like:<p><pre><code>  function onServerRequest(req, res) {\n      db.query(""get filename"", function(result) {\n          fs.readContents(result, function (data) {\n              res.write(data);\n          });\n      });\n  }\n</code></pre>\nwhich can get pretty nasty if you're running things in serial, or want to run a couple of things in parallel but then run something serially, you can have a workflow more like this:<p><pre><code>  function onServerRequest(req, res) {\n      var queryPromise = db.queryPromise(""get filename"");\n      var filename = yield queryPromise;\n\n      var data = yield db.readContentsPromise(filename);\n    \n      res.write(data);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThe main difference between the two is that the async functions in the latter return promises instead of nothing.  The db.queryPromise() function itself would probably look something like:<p><pre><code>  function queryPromise(query) {\n      var promise = new Promise();\n      db.query(query, function(result) {\n          promise.putValue(result);\n      });\n      return promise;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nI imagine you could probably write a function to automatically generate promise wrappers for existing async functions as long as they followed a certain schema, and Node's functions tend to do well with that.<p>Anyway, the onServerRequest() function would itself be wrapped in a function which took the generator values from it and returned its own promise.  This way you could stack promises all the way up.<p>The gjs implementation of this is here: <a href=""http://git.gnome.org/browse/gjs/tree/modules/promise.js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git.gnome.org/browse/gjs/tree/modules/promise.js</a><p>This is pretty similar to Twisted's inlineCallbacks if you're familiar with them in Python.",1298956548

A key idea is you don't confront a competitor head-on, but begin in markets that they don't care about, with a product that's not as good, in <i>their customers' opinion</i>, and so doesn't threaten them.<p>> <i>Disruptive innovation</i>, a term of art coined by Clayton Christensen, describes a process by which a product or service takes root initially in simple applications at the bottom of a market and then relentlessly moves ‘up market’, eventually displacing established competitors.<p>> An innovation that is disruptive allows a whole new population of consumers access to a product or service that was historically only accessible to consumers with a lot of money or a lot of skill.  Characteristics of disruptive businesses, at least in their initial stages, can include:  lower gross margins, smaller target markets, and simpler products and services that may not appear as attractive as existing solutions when compared against traditional performance metrics.<p>> Because companies tend to innovate faster than their customers’ lives change, most organizations eventually end up producing products or services that are too good, too expensive, and too inconvenient for many customers.  By only pursuing “sustaining innovations” that perpetuate what has historically helped them succeed, companies unwittingly open the door to “disruptive innovations”.\n<a href=""http://www.claytonchristensen.com/disruptive_innovation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.claytonchristensen.com/disruptive_innovation.html</a> [see also <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_technology#The_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_technology#The_theor...</a>]<p>Far from being excruciatingly painful, the disrupted incumbent is often at the height of their success, well-respected and well-liked, and doing a great job at serving their customers. For example, just before Digital's fall (the puzzle that Christensen wanted to understand in his PhD) it was a highly lauded company. <i>How could Digital get killed?</i> he implored.<p>To me, this article's use of ""disruption"" is a signal of quality that says: <i>this is not a rigorous article.</i> It seems to be using <i>disruption</i> in its common dictionary meaning, <i>to shake things up</i>. But when writing on technology adoption and startups to a seasoned audience, one would expect an awareness of the technical meaning. Although, to be fair, it does seem that many people in startup circles use the term extremely broadly (as if it meant ""to compete with"" or ""to beat"").

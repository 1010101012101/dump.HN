Mars; the counterpart should get flipped instantly, no?

But, that's not enough - lots of people of that caliber apply.  You've got to have something about your application that makes you stand out, that makes you special. You will simply stick in the recruiter's mind. And in this case, stickiness is good.<p>It's the same thing when you're creating a startup -- you got to stand out.",1192552635

The playing field between 3rd party mobile software startups is level when no one else can get in. <p>In a selectively open platform, companies that are ""picked"" to develop for the iPhone have a distinct competitive advantage over those who do not.

The reason is that there generally are no details to give.

Some of this stuff is random, some of this stuff you can make happen, and some is a combination. YC is a combination. They're doing their best to figure out who to pick and you're doing your best to make your company work. Golden rule of being self-employed: NEVER focus on one opportunity or plan. Always have several things going. And be flexible about it.<p>
What's PG say their success rate is? Something like 50%? Sure -- it'd be great to be in a graduating class, but getting into YC is NOT like passing a test. You don't control it and even for the people who do control it, it's a crap shoot. It's more like bumping into some folks in the hall and chatting a bit and giving them your business card. Maybe they'll call. Maybe not. Don't get your hopes on it. How much can you really convey to somebody by bumping into them and chatting in the hall?",1192550537

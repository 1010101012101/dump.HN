So the best you can do is infer it from what you already know of that person. But if you already know so much as to be able to infer it, you can understand/predict that person's behavior without resorting to any pigeon-holing.",1212256741
205329,story,,,1,2,iamdave,"Ask YC: To Hack or Not to Hack?",,"I got a phone call this past week from a good pal of mine.<p>He and an associate of his are looking to have a website built.  A directory of sorts for local businesses.  Due to a confidentiality agreement that's about as much as I can say, but it's going to be a massive project.<p>My team of 4 is excited about it, and rightfully they should it looks like it could be a great challenge for all of us, both in production and infrastructure demands.<p>After performing a project analysis, it became quickly evident that this is going to be a very expensive deal for him.  This isn't just a glorified business card website ""this is our company, call this number and buy our stuff"" situation, and I somewhat fear he and his partner's commitment to this idea may be less than great once they see the costs and responsibilities on their end.  This is completely unfounded, but from the rhetoric and context they explained what they wanted, I don't think they completely understand the magnitude of what they're asking for in terms of actually putting together such a website.<p>We have a ball park estimate produced, as well as a few slides detailing some of the avenues we plan to take in making this site happen that will be presented this coming Monday.  All of this said, after alerting him of the possibility that prices will be high, and he may need to seek support from outside investors, would it be wise to continue with this project?  As I said my speculation that this project may be over their pay range is completely unfounded, but not unlikely.<p>(It kind of brings this image to mind: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/38/80500328_2cf369deb4_o.jpg)",1212256715
205328,comment,205318,205318,0,0,metachor,,,"Both and neither.  On a case-by-case basis, I will do some light google research on the experience of the mac-unix community for that particular package.  Sometimes either the fink or ports release is recommended over the other, sometimes a stand-alone installer has been made, and often I just choose to compile from source.  The decision is usually based on factors including latest version available (fink and ports are not always up to date), reported stability, dependencies (I might already have some of the dependencies obtained by one particular method), etc.  If the choice was just between fink and ports on their merits alone, I slightly prefer ports, but that is probably a religious decision (a la vi vs emacs, etc...).",1212256675

They can only start and continue violence. They can't build homes, mend communities, teach children or care for the sick and injured. They can't  stock shelves or forgive debts. These war bots appeal to young men who have not yet faced physical adversity &military & political leaders too far removed and too surrounded by military contractors. Would you want your family to face these machines? I disagree with the claim that force protection is a valid basis for bots. Thebots don'tprotect the troops. They continue violencethey can't stop. Every bomb  dropped leaves more work for soldiers on the ground and increases the hostility of the local population toward those troops. Those troops are your friends, neighbors, sons and daughters.<p>If code is law, what codable theoretical concept can society use to stop young men and the leaders of the military-industrial complex from killing us all in a scorched earth search for a technological solution to war? The concern most have expressed here boils down to <i>moral hazard</i>, the same concept employed to curb bailouts of housing speculators and big companies. In both the bot and bailout cases, moral hazard has been gradually removed  from the decision-making process. In finance, computing power, a credible objective(profit), gimicks, and the failure of regulators to keep pace with their charges, made it possible for the actors to get into the problems they now face. In the military-industrial complex the case is more extreme:massive computing power, a credible objective (less danger to our troops (they thought)), and a complete abdication of regulatory responsibility, and exceptionally simple regulatory basis (can't get much simpler than the five bases of jus ad bellum). How to put lot more moral hazard back into the equations?",1212256360

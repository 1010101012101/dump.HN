As we all know, science doesn&#x27;t work that way.  This study needs to be put into context with other studies, if it contradicts those studies, that needs to be discussed, future studies that might resolve the discrepancy should be identified, limitations on the applicability of this study and on the ones it contradicts should be pointed out, changes in the model we use to understand the effects of mobility and posture on health should be discussed, etc. etc.<p>Instead, we get serial repetitions of &quot;standing is bad&quot;, &quot;standing is good&quot;, &quot;it doesn&#x27;t really matter&quot;.

Growth is great, but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that profits are in the pipeline (e.g. Groupon).<p>And on top of that, what exactly is it that Square does that it&#x27;s going to be profitable on?  Is it the Point of Sale devices?  Is it their Square Readers?  Is it their small-business loans?  They&#x27;re not a terribly focused company, and maybe that&#x27;s a reflection of their CEO doing double-time (completely speculation on my part).<p>Personally I see this as their last-ditch effort to grab some cash, to exit before the market gets worse.

We also want to express our sympathy to the women who were victimized, and we deeply regret the pain they have suffered.<p>Once the investigation in to Professor Marcy’s conduct concluded, Berkeley’s leadership considered disciplinary options, but did not have the authority, as per University of California policy, to unilaterally impose any disciplinary sanctions. Discipline of a faculty member would include an additional faculty-led investigation, and a full hearing before a faculty committee, is a lengthy and uncertain one. In addition, the standards of evidence that would be used in that process are higher than those that are applied by the Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination(OPHD) in the course of its investigations. The faculty-led process would also be subject to a three-year statute of limitations.

I&#x27;m not sure this is a valid assumption.<p>For a hot and fast civilisation like us to exist for serious amounts of time in space, it&#x27;s going to have to adapt to living in space --- because, as you say, it&#x27;s intensely hostile. One of the key adaptations is to stop being hot and fast. If you can live on small energy budgets you&#x27;re way more likely to survive. If you live slowly then travel becomes much easier, as well as costing less.<p>But if you become a cold and slow civilisation, inner solar systems aren&#x27;t going to be very hospitable --- hot, radioactive, space is so bent that travel is enormously difficult, everything&#x27;s at the bottom of cripplingly expensive gravity wells... why bother? The gas giants are rich, but are even more expensive (to get from low orbit around one of the moons of Jupiter to low orbit around another takes about 10 km/s. You can launch from  the <i>surface</i> of Earth for that). But further out... the Kuiper and Oort clouds are peaceful, cheap, hospitable, and chock full of light elements with interesting (if slow) chemistry.<p>Estimates of the Oort cloud density predict that there&#x27;ll be a 20km body every 30 light seconds or so, and that there&#x27;s about five Earth masses in Sol&#x27;s Oort cloud alone.

They may not bother; if we survive long enough to adapt to space, we&#x27;ll be out there soon. Or they may not be able, depending on their energy budget. Or maybe they are, and we just haven&#x27;t noticed. (New Horizons has a 12W transmitter and we would have to be looking in exactly the right direction to spot it.

CF is basically a salt-wasting condition. There are various forms of defect in the CFTR, but knowing that it basically leaks may explain why it is basically a salt wasting condition.</i>&quot;<p>Errr, that was referring to normal CFTR.  The class of proteins it belongs to normally require ATP, the ready energy source in cells, to actively transport stuff, e.g. use up one molecule of ATP to transport one molecule of whatever.  CFTR is &#x27;broken&#x27; in that it looks a whole lot like one of these proteins, but instead of ATP being used to transport a molecule, i.e. against an osmotic gradient, the ATP just &quot;opens its door&quot; (or the reverse, I didn&#x27;t check), and then ions and water go whichever way the gradient favors.  I.e. if there&#x27;s lots more water in the cell than outside the cell, it goes out.<p><i>So one of the things I found was that there are two conditions that cause higher misfolds of proteins within the cell: Derangement of PH level and derangement of salt level. You see both of these things happening with CF.</i><p>Ah, I see where there&#x27;s usefulness here, given the variety of CFTR mutations (and note that one person might have two different mutations, one contributed from each parent, or arising from very early stage embryo mutations).  There will be mutations that as you describe, where if you can adjust the conditions under which the protein is created and initially folds, and or preforms afterwards, you get a more favorable outcome.<p>As for acid, well, it depends on where the acid is.  Acidosis is a condition outside the cell, per the <i>Merck Manual</i> &quot;<i>Acidosis is excessive blood acidity caused by an overabundance of acid in the blood or a loss of bicarbonate from the blood (metabolic acidosis), or by a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood that results from poor lung function or slow breathing (respiratory acidosis).</i>&quot;<p>So to refine your hypothesis, once the protein is in the cell membrane, a greater concentration of hydronium ions (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydronium"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydronium</a>) outside will damage it.  And if the outside is more acid than the cell, they&#x27;ll flow in through the channel, where they can donate a proton (bare hydrogen atom), doing mischief to CFTR or even the cell.<p><i>So I have concluded that there is a vicious positive feedback loop where the more acid you get, the more you see protein misfolds and the more you see protein misfolds, the more acid you get. I believe this is why it is a degenerative, progressive condition.</i><p>That would only happen if your as blood gets more acid, it stays more acid, but short of requiring intervention.  Note also that proteins tend to? often? have have a life cycle, they get produced, work for a while, often get zapped one way or another, and then get recycled.  That mutation class I mentioned of premature degradation implies this is true for CTFR; the cell would fail to keep up production sufficient to counter that.  Note also there should be a signaling mechanism that tells the cell to produce more or less of CTFR, I&#x27;m assuming that even if the signal is &quot;I really need more!&quot;, the cell has a limit to how much it can produce, and still survive, it can&#x27;t under-produce other vital stuff too much ... and that also might have an effect.<p>Sounds like there&#x27;s cumulative damage elsewhere that can&#x27;t be reversed in this way, e.g. the stated pancreas scarring that causes Type 1 diabetes, or the classic clubbed fingers per the Wikipedia picture.<p><i>But most people with CF are prescribed a high salt, high fat, high calorie diet. This means they are actively encouraged by medical professionals to eat a junk food diet. I went the other way. I pay very close attention to the quality of my food, not the quantity. I went looking for good quality fats and salts and other foods. I think the current practice of prescribing a junk food diet because it is high in fat and salt without caring that it is low in quality is part of what is killing people with CF.</i><p>Well, salt is salt, and it might help to increase the saltiness of your blood (not sure how much that&#x27;s possible or practical), you&#x27;ll end up with more salt inside the cells (or that sounds likely, but there are surely other proteins that also can transport salt in and out), and outside the cell, the former probably not so good, the latter perhaps in balance for the best for many people.<p>More later if you wish when you have time, on this HN topic, or you&#x27;re welcome to email me (see the address in my account info).",1444855770

They were marketing geniuses and that is something I learned a lot about that I likely would have never studied.

I know what quality looks like that in area. I have seen many good examples.<p>It made it clear that I don&#x27;t do well in a big bureaucracy. But it also exposed me to world class training and awareness of public image and some other things that have been very important for me.<p>I was a homemaker for a long time. Figuring out how to interact effectively with the public did not come easily to me. I was pretty socially adept, but what worked one-on-one did not work in more public settings and I am not sure I would have gotten a good handle on that had I not worked at a large company for a few years. Trying to marry skills developed during a long period of having a very private life to goals of having higher engagement with the public has been an uphill battle.<p>I really got a lot out of working for a large company, but I am unlikely to do so again.

The fact that &#x27;overall&#x27; men have better experiences will be cold comfort to such people. While in aggregate we tend to encourage men/boys to play chess, and as such there are a lot of competitive men, an individual man/boy may have a very different experience. Telling that one man/boy that overall men have it better in this scenario (and others) just won&#x27;t be compelling. That&#x27;s why I tend to argue that we should consider these incentives.

GSA pegs the average value of Medicaid around $8,000 but consider the max family out-of-pocket for Bronze ACA without any subsidies is $13,200, and that&#x27;s not even counting the premiums, so that $8,000 value is assuming a a relatively health family of 4.<p>If the family has chronic health needs, then getting eligible for Medicaid can save upwards of $25,000 per year between premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. Also note, SSDI is ~$48,000/yr for a fully vested disabled individual with 2 children.<p>So I definitely agree if you just look at the tax return the average healthy family of 4 will see net income rising certainly before you hit $100k gross. How much their cost-of-living is increasing in lock-step with that rise, versus how much is eaten by increasing work-related and income-related expenses is a more contentious topic which I have yet to find, even from GSA, a truly comprehensive analysis which includes the effects of the ACA.",1444854942

They are <i>extremely</i> time and cycle-durable: 20-<i>50 years</i>, almost immune to repeated deep discharges, relatively cheap and simple to produce. Cons: they need a bit of maintenance (not a big deal at grid scale), and have a less-than-stellar efficiency.<p>The problem with compressed air is that the Ideal-gas law [1] actively works against you to reduce efficiency, assuming it will be kept at ambient temperature. Inserting energy by compressing gas heats it up, which increases the pressure of the gas in the tank, which makes you work harder to put more gas in. Extracting energy cools the gas down, which reduces the pressure of the gas, which reduces the amount of energy you can extract from it. You can mitigate these issues by carefully controlling the temperature of the gas (more energy) or having a much much bigger tank so a single cycle only thermally cycles by a small amount (more $$).<p>Another option I hadn&#x27;t considered until now is to let it heat up -- and insulate it to let it stay hot. It will cycle in both pressure <i>and</i> temperature on a nearly daily basis so you may not lose all that much energy in heat.

Obviously, this was a race condition. After a lot of hair-puling and waiting for 5-30min every time I wanted to test something, I decided to simply replaced the actual locking code with a single global spinlock at every entry to see if a serialized driver worked[1].<p>After that version still crashed, and a lot of trial and error, I finally found out that the spinlock were never actually running. Microsoft&#x27;s compiler was compiling loops like this as if it was a NOOP:<p><pre><code>    #define SPINLOCK(lock)      \
        for (;;) {              \
            if (TESTLOCK(lock)) \
                break;          \
        }
</code></pre>
But it worked after I made this change:<p><pre><code>    -    for (;;) {
    +    while (1) {
</code></pre>
Empty for loops were dropped... but only in macros. Now I&#x27;m wondering if it was getting commented out in some subtle way.<p>[1] There was some concern about hardware errors, as a similar PCI chip we were using failed to notice changes in the PCI GNT# if it change REQ# in the same clock cycle.",1444853082

In my experience, the implementation language and APIs can easily lead one to a suboptimal realization of algorithms.<p>Once done, the original python code can serve as a reference implementation for conformance and unit testing.

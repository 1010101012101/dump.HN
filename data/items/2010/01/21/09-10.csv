Or simply, what legitimizes government?<p>2) If government is legitimate, what are the limits of its mandate where an individual's fundamental rights are concerned?<p>Western governments can claim to express the will of the people because it is the people who have elected them (directly or indirectly). The Chinese government's power is based on a military campaign many decades ago. It cannot claim to speak for the chinese people. The laws it makes are nothing but the the will of a clique of people with guns.<p>The second question is a very difficult one. Where do fundamental individual rights come from? Who defines them with any legitimacy? Does it have something to do with nature or psychology or are the relative to culture? I don't know, but I do know that I want to claim individual rights independently of any collective expression of opinion and power, and everyone else I know wants to do that as well.<p>If western governments run a system of censorship it may in many cases be a violation of fundamental individual rights. That doesn't change the fact that it may at the same time be a legitimate expression of the will of the people. It may be the will of the people to violate fundamental individual rights. That's the contradiction we in the west have to grapple with, and it's totally different from the problem the Chinese have with their clique of men with guns holding them hostage.",1264066226

If you're feeling completely burned out, you might want to chill out and travel around for a few weeks (or whatever) to clear your head. After that:<p>- If you want, go back and get your degree (it only gets harder as you get older)<p>- Do an entrepreneur-in-residence gig (instead of an associate.) From what I've seen, EIRs do anything from hanging out and shooting the shit all day (i.e. very little) to reviewing investments/networking/helping portfolio companies to actively incubating their next idea (or a bunch of ideas simultaneously)<p>- Join a growing startup that is past the ramen-fueled-fight-for-survival frenzy, which might be a good balance of upside vs expected value. A lot of former YC founders do this if their companies don't work out. As a current venture-backed founder/CEO, I can say with certainty that your startup experience would be highly valued.<p>- Join Google, Microsoft, or Facebook, check your dreams at the door, and ride out comfortably into a middle-aged sunset (I kid, I kid.)<p>Feel free to email me at drew at dropbox[dot]com if you want stories or intros to people who have been through this.",1264066010

You'd want to be able to be proud of some specific fact about yourself and unfortunately nationality is a particularly easy way for minorities like the Chinese (in the US) to do this.<p>And so this easily leads to American raised Chinese to jump on board supporting their home country. The alternative is to admit that their special home country needs advice from the US. Perhaps they weren't properly (or weren't in the US long enough) brainwashed to accept democracy, but something is causing them to think that they understand the complex policies better than the rest of the developed world simply because they lived there once.<p>I also know a Chinese international student in Canada for college who insists that I am brainwashed by the west. I think that's a pretty bold statement since it pretty much implies that I was too stupid to distinguish the noise from the truths when I learn shit, since the fundamental difference between the democratic world and the communist world is that in the democratic world the truth is always there no matter how much shit is piled on top of it and in the communist world they just pile shit on your face and actively try to hold the truths out of reach.<p>I think with the silly gaffs like the little girl who was lip syncing at the olympics that the CCP is still tripping over itself on <i>universally</i> backwards policies, and that all this is not just a case of the <i>west</i> trying to assert its cultural differences onto China.",1264064567

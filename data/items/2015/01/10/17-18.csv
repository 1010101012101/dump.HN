This lets you plug in previous-generation serialization protocols like Protobuf, Thrift, or Avro but probably won&#x27;t allow you to plug in a next-generation zero-copy protocol like Cap&#x27;n Proto, SBE, or FlatBuffers, where the in-memory data structure and the wire format are one and the same.

It&#x27;s better to have full coverage of empirical tests across an entire system than limited coverage of formal tests, for instance.  So, on that account, you may be correct from a pragmatic perspective.<p>From an epistemological perspective, a test suite to confirm a property using chosen examples is not nearly as good as a formal proof that guarantees a property over a given domain.  For simple cases, such as branch coverage, the test suite may be good enough.  As complexity increases, or when testing things like modular arithmetic over an elliptic curve, unit testing leads to false confidence.<p>But, just like in empirical testing, it&#x27;s possible to build bad proofs.  This is where the specialization comes in.  There may be plenty of competent engineers who can hack at a test suite, but their results will not be nearly as comprehensive as someone trained in formal verification.<p>It all comes down to epistemology.

From <i>The Art of Loving:</i><p>If a person loves only one other person and is indifferent to the rest of his fellow men, his love is not love but a symbiotic attachment, or an enlarged egotism. Yet most people believe that love is constituted by the object, not by the faculty. In fact, they even believe that it is proof of the intensity of their love when they do not love anybody except the &quot;loved&quot; person. This is the same fallacy which I have already mentioned above. Because one does not see that love is an activity, a power of the soul, one believes that all that is necessary to find is the right object - and that everything goes by itself afterward. This attitude can be compared to that of the man who wants to paint but who, instead of learning  the art, claims that he just has to wait for the right object - and that he will paint beautifully when he finds it. If I truly love one person I love all persons, I love the world, I love life.

Not because the server is &quot;maintaining the authentication cookie&quot;, but precisely because the server is maintaining no state at all, it&#x27;s all in the cookie (which in the latest versions of Rails is by default encrypted and signed, to prevent snooping or tampering -- but that doesn&#x27;t prevent replay).<p>I think most people set cookies https only, figure they can&#x27;t therefore be sniffed, and don&#x27;t worry about it.<p>If you wanted to deal with it, still without maintaining session state on the server, I guess the best thing to do would be to put a timestamp in the cookie, and refuse to honor &#x27;old&#x27; cookies?

This amounts to a search as there is penetration into one&#x27;s protected property and no probable cause exists just by virtue of being in public. A passive detector, on the other hand would be completely reasonable, such as a radiation detector because the material being detected is being emitted, basically being broadcast, while invasive detectors are  actually &#x27;entering&#x27; the area being targeted.<p>My question is, how many bombs have been discovered? What&#x27;s the success rate? Probably close to zero; otherwise they&#x27;d be trumpeting their successes all over the media to justify further expansion of this type of search.<p>It&#x27;s funny how the TSA has had virtually zero success in catching terrorists, yet we still allow them to anally probe us in the cause of safety. I&#x27;d rather have a hijacking once per decade and go back to the pre 9-11 airport security system than go through a proverbial strip search every time I fly. 9-11 didn&#x27;t happen because of a catastrophic failure of airport security: it was a failure on multiple levels -- from immigration enforcement, intelligence failures, etc. El Al screening methods are most effective, but TSA&#x27;s political correctness has then treating an 85 year old black woman from Birmingham with the same level of scrutiny as a 23 year old from Egypt with Yemeni entry stamps in the passport.",1420909989

8867135,comment,8866849,8866849,0,0,sz4kerto,,,"I have been playing with an idea to decentralize search (or, more generally, information processing).<p>I would consist of<p>- a publicly available hierarchical type system (similar to how classes look like in an OOP language with multiple inheritance). For example, URL is a type, or set of search terms is a type.<p>- any number of nodes on the net. Each of them would provide a mapping from a set of input data to a set of output data (data is defined in the terms of the types). For example, Google would provide a mapping from set of search terms to URLs, but that&#x27;s a very generic node.<p>- the nodes also advertise the cost of one mapping operation. The cost is given in some kind of currency (?).<p>- there should be routers that can find a route between a set of input types to a set of output types. The route is composed of nodes, obviously, that pass information between them and finally the output is the stuff the user wanted.<p>- the user pays the sum of the cost needed for his query (transformation)<p>- the user could pay nothing if some nodes have negative cost. There could be a node that takes a set of URLs (search results) and produces a set of URLs that are basically the original URLs + some advertisements. Therefore if somebody specifies that he wants a transformation from types X to types Z (and provides data of types X) under cost C, then the routers should find a set of nodes under these constraints<p>- nodes could provide mappings that are the same as other nodes, and the routers would slowly insert them into mapping chains, and rate them based on some user feedback (this is essentially a genetic algorithm)<p>This system could very much help good competition in the distributed information processing industry. Nowadays nobody can really compete with Google or Bing because you need to build _everything_ in one step. A distributed infrastructure like this that&#x27;s based on the evolution of components would lower the barriers to entry dramatically. Also, data would be shared across participants, not owned only by the one single market leader.<p>Ok, this is just a very naive and early idea, and it&#x27;s also too big to implement in my spare time at the moment, but I think it&#x27;d be an interesting way to apply the good old Unix principles for building internet services.",1420909364

In fact, from what I can see, the whole purpose of scrum is to disempower developers while giving them the illusion they are empowered.<p>As the author reveals, under scrum, it is not the developers who decide what new features to add to the software. It is the product owners.<p>Who decides the priority of the new features under scrum? Not the developers but the product owners.<p>At least under waterfall, developers could get their teeth into a good chunk of interesting work. They could come up with some fancy architecture or something. But under scrum, all work is broken up into bite-sized chunks of work that are rarely challenging and often highly repetitive.<p>Under scrum, the developer's time and ingenuity are not valued. If a product owner out of the blue decides to ditch a new feature or radically change one, wasting the work a developer has done creating it, he does so without a moment's concern about the developer's wasted time and effort.<p>In short all that scrum offers developers is a small amount of control over their workload. Compare that with developers of the past, who would conceive software and build it themselves the way they wanted, and you can see that, far from empowering developers, scrum has reduced them to little more than assembly line robots, at the beck and call of their masters.<p>I am not saying that we should go back to the past when developers were in charge or everything but to say that scrum empowers developers when it clearly does not needs to be challenged.",1317223651

I'm not sure branch prediction is realistic, though; I'm not actually parsing the code myself, so finding the branch points would be a lot of extra work.  I'm considering a scheme where you have to call an extra function inside each branching statement to get useful branch prediction results.  Something along the lines of:<p><pre><code>    for x in foreach([1...VA.length], ""for1"")\n      y = 0\n      while branch(VA.gt(x, y), ""while1"")\n        y++\n        if branch(y == x, ""if1"")\n          break\n      VA.insert(x, y)\n</code></pre>\nWhere the `branch`, `foreach` functions are identities over their first argument, and they use the second argument to to track branching for a given branch point (i.e. you must uniquely name each branch, foreach line).  A foreach would be a branch run arg0.length + 1 times, with arg0.length true branches followed by a single false branch.  Sound at all reasonable?",1317222874

Since the savings are placed so forward in time and are not guaranteed at all, by the time the problem becomes a concern the money will already have been made. Let's say a homeowner starts a blog showing that they are paying much more for power with their new system than from the grid and questions it. Google then points out that the savings will come in 2030 at the end of the loan. If a journalist looking into this is persistent and good they will get a commitment to show exact numbers, which can then be directly discussed as to likelihood. But more likely the graphs will continue to have unmarked y axes, and those doing an analysis of how much the systems cost and what it means to charge 11% interest for 20 years will be discounted as not having the right facts, but no details as to what facts are incorrect and what the correct facts are will be forthcoming. Then, in 2030 the articles will either say how forward thinking the purchasers were to have bought in before electricity skyrocketed, or there will be a retrospective on how they got ripped off. In both cases, Google will have made their money back on their investment in collateral backed AAA rated debt securities.",1317222715

3048153,comment,3046651,3046651,42,0,kragen,,,"This is an interesting case where you can improve your negotiating leverage by giving up freedom.  Consider a researcher who wants their research to be open access.  They can attempt to negotiate this every time they send a paper to a journal, but most researchers are not in a very strong negotiating position relative to the journal.  Or they can accept a postdoc position at Princeton, which now means that every time they submit a paper, they must inform the journal that unfortunately they cannot assign copyright.<p>There are many journals who would be willing to decline to publish the papers of an individual intransigent researcher. There are not many journals who would be willing to ban papers from Princeton entirely.<p>As an example, Dan Bernstein, who is certainly a well-respected researcher in his field, has individually adopted a policy of dedicating his papers to the public domain so that, like researchers employed by the US Government, he cannot assign copyright in them.  The IEEE has consequently decided to reject his papers even when its referees accept them, even though they accept papers from US Government researchers: <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/writing/ieee.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/writing/ieee.html</a><p>This kind of phenomenon, where giving up freedom improves your negotiating position, was extensively studied by Schelling in his theory of negotiation.<p>It's also very relevant to the debate over Treacherous (or ""Trusted"") Computing, signed bootloaders, and the like.  You might prefer not to have the option of cryptographically certifying to Warner Music that your machine is running an approved operating system on approved hardware.  That's because if you have that option, they might not sell you music unless you exercise it, probably giving up many of the rights you have under copyright law; while if you don't have that option, they are faced with a less tempting choice of only selling you a CD.<p>Advocates of these systems sometimes design systems where you have full freedom to run either signed or unsigned software, claiming that this makes their systems safe from abuse.  This overlooks this phenomenon, where having a freedom makes you subject to pressure to exercise it.",1317222181

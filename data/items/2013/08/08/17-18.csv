Python pushes the limit wrt to memory and battery consumption, but if you code conservatively and make judicious use of Cython or native code libraries, you can do OK.  Incidentally, Python performance seems just fine for GUI programming on modern mobile phones (based on personal experience). But because of the way you have to package Python/Lua/Ruby programs, it takes a long time to open them.  But once they are open, they all do fine (and Lua does fine any way you want to measure it).<p>As someone developing on Android, I so wish that Google had opted for native code on Android, and a native toolchain SDK, which would have allowed people to use almost whatever language they wanted: C, C++, Python, Lua, Ruby, etc.  If that had been the case, I suspect most people would opt to use C or C++ for the backend, and code the frontend GUI in Python, Lua, or Ruby.<p>And yes, you can use the NDK now, but everything visual has to pass through Java.",1375984432

Solving puzzles and fitting different pieces into place to create new things is awesome, but this part of work faded with time.<p>Instead, it turned out to be mostly connecting pieces that don&#x27;t fit correctly and covering it up. It&#x27;s not that it wouldn&#x27;t be possible to do better, but I can&#x27;t think of a way doing it without loosing too much time and therefore money. Also, the feedback loop of implementing and debugging seems to have a negative conditioning effect suggesting me a rather negative outcome of situations in general.<p>To overcome struggles like these I observed many programmers, myself included, obsessing with improving their programming tools and skills. Searching for and thinking of paradigms, techniques, languages, frameworks etc. that could improve the work started to become an important part of my day and from my observations, others too. This may have improved my programming skills and work quality, but it did not make me enjoy the work more.<p>With time I started to hate computers. Not because they don&#x27;t improve my life in some aspects, but because I&#x27;m one of those that make them work.

It takes a lot of courage to make that statement especially for someone with great public influence.<p>I&#x27;m just curious as to why it took him this long. Medical marijuana has been prescribed in hospitals for some time with great benefit. I mean, just from a clinical standpoint, he should&#x27;ve seen the great upsides and limited downsides to using the drug. Patients, typically the elderly, with cachexia from cancer are often given marijuana to stimulate their appetite, and it works. Given its  possible links with the development of Schizophrenia and the rest of its relatively mild side-effects, a quick and simple benefits/costs analysis should show that in many cases, its efficacy far outweighs the potential risks.<p>A <i>huge</i> percentage of physicians today, as indicated in the article, would be supportive of a move to legalize it. And it has been this way for several years. I just do not understand why it took Gupta so many years, having to go to the ends of the earth to dig up research from various countries to come to that conclusion.<p>My suspicion is that his initial viewpoint was more rooted in irrational bias and ignorance than in scientific evidence proving the drug&#x27;s inefficacy. You can tell that by his mentioning of his children and how he wouldn&#x27;t let them try marijuana, which is both irrelevant to the issue and an ignorant emotionally-charged argument commonly used when the topic of legalization (for medical use) is brought up. It&#x27;s effectively &quot;but remember the children!&quot; The same could&#x27;ve been said for legalization of opioids and a myriad of other medications that have much more severe side-effects. And that really saddens me, because I&#x27;ve got great respect for the guy. I&#x27;m glad he&#x27;s on what I believe to be the right side, but as someone with great influence in this country, with such an accomplished background, I feel he could&#x27;ve arrived to this conclusion much earlier, with much less data, and pushed for its medical legalization when the conversation was happening.<p>All in all welcome aboard, Dr. Gupta.

There&#x27;s research [0] into CBD mitigating THC&#x27;s interference with memory formation.<p>Also, intentionally-high-CBD strains are under development [1]:<p>&quot;A high-CBD cannabis strain was developed in the 1980s by David Watson and Robert Clarke, American naturalists who founded a company called Hortapharm in Amsterdam to pursue their goal of developing plant strains for different purposes. (The day Watson and Clarke became expatriates is the day the U.S. lost its lead in the field of cannabis therapeutics.) In 1998 Hortapharm sold its seed stock to a British start-up, GW Pharmaceuticals, which has since developed a strain that expresses 97% of its cannabinoid content as CBD.<p>GW plans to test its high-CBD strain as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, psychotic disorders, and epilepsy. It is now in Phase 2 trials to determine the dose levels to use in clinical trials involving people. GW mixes its high-CBD and high-THC strains in a 1:1 ratio to make Sativex, a plant extract formulated for spraying under the tongue that has been approved in Canada and elsewhere to treat neuropathic pain associated with multiple sclerosis. CBD evidently bolsters the pain-killing effects of THC while moderating its psychoactivity.&quot;<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101001/full/news.2010.508.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101001/full/news.2010.508.ht...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.counterpunch.org/2007/07/14/who-s-afraid-of-cannabidiol/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.counterpunch.org/2007/07/14/who-s-afraid-of-canna...</a>",1375983510

6180441,comment,6179163,6179965,8,0,dctoedt,,,"> <i>For better or worse, the shareholders are the ones who set the pay of the CEO.</i><p>Um, no.  At publicly-traded U.S. companies, executive compensation is <i>set</i> in the first instance by the compensation committee of the board of directors [1].  The law requires only that shareholders be allowed to vote on non-binding &quot;say on pay&quot; resolutions at least every three years (or more often if the shareholders so vote) [2].<p>It&#x27;s been suggested that executive compensation naturally and inexorably ratchets upward because:<p>+ Comp committee members don&#x27;t want to be sued by shareholders for negligence or gross negligence in setting executive comp.   (That&#x27;s just what happened when Disney was required to pay ex-CEO Michael Ovitz a $140 million severance package even though he&#x27;d been on the job only a year or so when he was shown the door [3].)<p>+ So, comp committees rely on survey reports about existing executive compensation levels in the relevant industry, market segment, etc.  (They also hire professional consultants to provide documentation and political cover.)<p>+ Comp-committee members are supposed to be independent, that is, not beholden to management. BUT, board members tend to be supportive of management:  They might well have been recruited by management.  Business friendships develop among management- and non-management board members as well as with senior executives. The board as a whole feels it&#x27;s a team; its members naturally want to be perceived as team players (they probably wouldn&#x27;t be on the board in the first place if that weren&#x27;t the case).<p>+ Here&#x27;s where it gets interesting: Comp-committee members <i>like</i> it when they can tell company executives, <i>your comp is in the top half for our industry</i>.  They might also honestly think that <i>their</i> company&#x27;s executives <i>deserve</i> to be paid at least in the top half of the &quot;comparables,&quot; that is, above either the average or the median for the company&#x27;s industry segment.  So consider what happens mathematically to executive compensation across the board when lots of comp committees have this mindset:  <i>The mid-range of the compensation band floats upward over time.</i><p>+ As the mid-range of the band rises over time, <i>future</i> compensation committees may feel pressure to raise executive compensation to keep up with the Joneses, that is, with the rising mid-range.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wlrk.com/webdocs/wlrknew/wlrkmemos/wlrk/wlrk.18330.11.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wlrk.com/webdocs/wlrknew/wlrkmemos/wlrk/wlrk.1833...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78n-1;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78n-1;</a> see also <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2011/33-9178-secg.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2011/33-9178-secg.htm</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.integrogroup.com/data/File/white-papers/exec_comp_disney_decision_jan_06.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.integrogroup.com/data/File/white-papers/exec_comp...</a>",1375983137

I&#x27;ve often seen people with older Windows laptops (newer Windows variants, 7 and 8 certianly Vista maybe, are much better at this) that are set to display UK time but think that they are in UTC-0700. This can be fun when using file synchronisation tools... If the OS doesn&#x27;t know its timezone then the browser won&#x27;t either. This is a moot point when you are talking to just one user, until that user fixes their clock settings of course, but becomes a significant issue as soon as you need to coordinate timed actions between users.<p>Detecting the local time offset from your reference clock isn&#x27;t always useful either: the machine&#x27;s clock could be completely wrong so it says 01:23 where the user&#x27;s wall-clock says 21:00 and your reference time matches neither.<p>Also some users may wish to fix your interface to a timezone other than the one currently set on the device they are currently using. Someone on holiday or on a business trip might want to keep some things linked to local time back home so they find it easier to coordinate with people there. Conversely someone currently in their home timezone might want to force your interface to match a non-local timezone for coordinating with teams/friends elsewhere in the world. You can&#x27;t rely on them adjusting their clock in this circumstance as they may not be using their own machine and so might not be able to adjust the time/timezone settings (or may wish to keep them accurate to current local for other reasons).<p><i>tl;dr:</i> Dealing with time values when there are <i>any</i> international concerns it harder than we tend to assume.",1375982960

My ride was bout 9 miles, which is longer than I&#x27;d expect most people to ride, but I couldn&#x27;t afford to be closer.<p>Biking on the same roads as cars is generally not fun.  I first used Middlefield most of the way, but that meant biking in with the cars.  It wasn&#x27;t until much later that I discovered Bryant street, which prohibits through motor traffic but allows bike traffic through.  It&#x27;s pleasant enough, but you are still sharing a road with cars and I&#x27;ve seen many simply blow through the stop signs on those residential streets (there are rarely any other people around anyway).  Even with Bryant, half my ride was on a major auto thoroughfare.<p>The position of bike lanes on American streets is stressful for bicyclists.  You basically have cars on either side.  On one side you have cars driving and who want to make right turns across your lane.  On the other side you have parked cars with drivers-side doors that completely block the bike path when open.  These people also want to cut across your lane to enter traffic.<p>In my roughly eight years of bicycling around the bay area I&#x27;ve only been hit once by an auto, and that was one where he was fully at fault for making a left turn into me when he acknowledged he saw me in the opposing lane and thought I was slowing for him (I slowed because it looked like he was going to turn without having right of way).  It was low speed and I wasn&#x27;t injured.  However, bicycling around the bay is not fun, despite having a few decent bike paths.<p>I&#x27;ve also biked in Amsterdam and I can attest that we have a long way to go.

Generate two maps of low frequency noise. Perlin noise would probably work well, but just blurred noise will do. If we&#x27;re thinking in terms of blurring, the radius should be on the order of x-height/2. Call that scale &quot;S&quot;. One map is for X and one is for Y.<p>2. Convert the text to Bzier curves.<p>3. Process those curves, subdividing any long curve segments until they are no longer than S.<p>4. Now, process the curves again, and for each point, look up the corresponding point in your two maps. Displace the point&#x27;s position according to the map value, with maximum distance somewhere on the order of S/4.<p>5. Render the new curves.<p>The parameters would need to be tweaked (I&#x27;m reporting them from vague memory), but that basic outline can provide surprisingly convincing results when applied to a handwriting font.

Additionally, 9/11 was used to drum up a great deal of additional support for the invasion by painting it as part of the war on terror. I don&#x27;t believe it was ever outright stated, but it was heavily implied that Iraq was partially responsible for 9/11, and that the invasion would prevent future attacks.<p>In a hypothetical world without 9/11, the Bush administration would still want to invade Iraq, no doubt.

The doctors couldn&#x27;t figure out what was wrong (ran all of the tests, put her on liquid diet and the pain continued) so her doctor put her on OxyContin until the HMO approved a referral to a research university. The insurance declined the referral stating they wanted a second opinion, so my wife went to get one and the doctor wanted her to get off all of the medications.

At least today, at least in this case, Dr Sanjay Gupta is one of the good guys.  Not for espousing one opinion or another, but because he&#x27;s publicly changed his mind after considering more evidence.  Maybe he has incomplete evidence, and maybe in the future he&#x27;ll change his mind three or four ways from more evidence.

The father of the victim has claimed the owners of ask.fm should be charged with murder, which is just ridiculous.<p>Any website which promotes, glorifies, or encourages bullying should be punished (definitely not with a charge of murder), but it would be fair game for a boycott or loss of advertising revenue. Ask.fm does in fairness provide a fairly easy platform for people to bully you, since it is all anonymous, but then so does any other social media site. The website has a duty to do as much as they can to stop abuse, but then so do the users themselves. No one is forcing you to have an ask.fm profile, or indeed engage with it.<p>If we look to Lawrence Lessig&#x27;s four modalities of regulation, up until this point, ask.fm has relied on the social norm of users not making hurtful comments to other users. Advertisers pulling out is a form of regulation by the market, but it will hurt the site, not the offending users, and I believe the site does as much as it can to stop bullying. Removing some of their revenue won&#x27;t stop the problem unless they shut the whole site down because they run out of money.",1375981217

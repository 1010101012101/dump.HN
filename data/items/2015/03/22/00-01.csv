Where I was in IBM Poughkeepsie we kept our programs on removable disks of somewhere around 16 in. in diameter.  I don&#x27;t remember the capacity but it was in MB.  At the end of the line of disk drives sat our 029 card punch.  I spent way too many hours at that punch because my fingers were so inept.  There was no backspace &#x27;cause you can&#x27;t unpunch holes.<p>We used a card based program to modify the code that accumulated on our personal disk as ISAM data sets.  I set that up for my department after dropping and bursting open a very long portable card carrier (of mostly unsequenced cards) that was used before my 1967 &quot;innovation.&quot;  :-)<p>What shocks me at the moment is the incredibly clear 50 year old mental map and images I have of that machine room and the computers in it.  A 360 model 50 that I primarily used.  Beside that a model 40, down the isle a model 67, behind that a 7094 and further on a big ol&#x27; model 85.  Across the hall a honking model 91.

So basically our platform allows users to create studies and structure the entire workflow of a trial(in a lot of these they are multi-staged so there are multiple steps that need to be designed). Now after this done, they can follow this workflow on our platform when they are conducting their trial in house. Now for parts where a doctor/researcher is not present(like drug/medication/treatment application), we have a mobile and web app that lets users answer questions/file serious adverse events if they face any, etc.<p>Now here is the cool part, the above is just the surface. Our team is really passionate about data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence and its applications in real world. So we do something called adaptive clinical trials where we run analytical models on the data that comes in and can forecast when the trajectory of a trial needs to be altered. This means you can catch any serious reactions to drugs, faster.<p>All in all, to answer the main question, our solution helps keep the costs of clinical trials low and reduces error rate. Being able to run these trials fast and keeping the costs low, allows not only for drugs to get out to the market faster, but also helps reduce the costs of drugs(due to the reduction of costs to process).<p>I also only explained the application of our tech in clinical trials, but our software is so flexible that it can be applied to any industry such as Consumer Insights, Depression analysis studies, etc.<p>Not sure if I adequately answered your question.",1426985541

In most industries, the way that plays out is that incumbents fail to change, new competitors emerge with the new processes baked into them from the beginning, and they then kill the incumbents.

There&#x27;s a very blunt and obvious explanation of what&#x27;s wrong here, and it&#x27;s the very unpolitical one.<p>Here&#x27;s the deal. Physicians and nurses and administrators are overworked and untrained to handle a modern operational model. The hospitals tend to be based around politics rather than patient care, though the party line is invariably &quot;help the patient&quot;. Doctors will, under the aegis of &quot;help the patient&quot;, justify hoarding equipment, setting up alarm thresholds that screw up operations across the unit, block acquisitions, and in general just make everything terrible left to their own devices.<p>Nurses are overworked and are charged with increasingly important parts of patient care, and at the same time are treated as annoying appendages of the rest of the medical apparatus and not given the respect or authority that they require to perform well at their jobs.<p>Billing is handled through arcane back-and-forths between the care providers themselves, the hospitals, insurance companies, the government, and collections agencies. I&#x27;ve seen at least one local children&#x27;s hospital (the economics of such institutions are quite fascinating) have banking and financing services occupying the same building as care (something you&#x27;d expect at a car lot, not a place where injured children are healed). Claims may take months or years to process, which is absurd.<p>The whole stinking mess should have been grist for the capitalist grinder decades ago. However, clever regulatory capture by hospitals and manufacturers and labor policies restricting the supply of new physicians has managed to prevent any of the normal efficiencies from being introduced.<p>When trying to introduce new technology, you have to fight the most conservative and risk-averse institutions you&#x27;ll ever encounter. People that do not understand basic statistics or mathematics, or that flat out refuse to recognize the value of operational data research in making decisions because &quot;they know better&quot;. You&#x27;ll be turned away because you&#x27;re not one of the chosen few, and ignored unless you can convince them that they get to put their name on the new shiny.<p>This is but the first level of the fractal of sadness and absurdity that is modern medicine in America.",1426982557

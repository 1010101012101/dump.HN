It&#x27;s certainly possible to google for blog posts and stack overflow questions to assemble such a list, but it would be handy to have them all in one place.<p>My use case is when interviewing candidates I often ask them to rate themselves on a scale of 1-5 in the languages they know, and then ask them increasingly &#x27;tricky&#x27; questions in each language to get a feel for how their &quot;personal&quot; scale aligns to their real knowledge. This works fine if we have an overlap of several languages, but in the case where I know nothing or very little of one of the languages they know I lose that data point.<p>I find it valuable to know what a &quot;I am a 1 at X&quot; vs &quot;I am a 3 X&quot; vs &quot;I am a 5 at X&quot; means to them, since I&#x27;ve found little correlation between how harshly someone rates themselves and their true ability. Sometimes self-rated 5s are really 5s by my book, sometimes self-rated 3s are really 5s by my book, and sometimes self-rated 5s are really 2s by my book. So I want to know how &quot;my scale&quot; translates to &quot;their scale&quot;. If it was more formalized I&#x27;d go as far as to get a &quot;confidence quotient&quot; for a person as self-critical and self-confident people can be fantastic engineers or horrible engineers.<p>Does anyone else do this process when interviewing?",1399568297

7716271,comment,7716070,7716070,3,0,themodelplumber,,,"I worked at a software testing firm as a summer job one year while I was still at university. A few of the guys at the firm were refugees from game testing gigs, and they universally said it sucked. So this doesn&#x27;t surprise me. Their experiences sounded pretty bad at the time, being that at this &quot;superior&quot; job, we worked standing up in a warehouse. Not the greatest working conditions unless you think it&#x27;s cool enough to be surrounded by computers of every sort.<p>I was really impressed by the guys who had been there for a while--they actually understood what they were doing, like the author of the linked article. If they looked over your shoulder for even a few seconds, it felt like you learned something.<p>One day the higher-ups noticed that I knew how to use a particular kind of software and within an hour I had a raise and a desk inside an air-conditioned office. No chance of doing warehouse work anymore. It was like the feeling you get when you go from a parking garage into a hotel lobby. That put the testing conditions into stark relief--it wasn&#x27;t really as fun or interesting as I thought it would be. Putting it on my resume afterwards attracted some really boring job offers. But lots of places want cheap QA.<p>The people on top at the testing firm had it pretty much figured out. If their clients wanted to pay for really high-quality testing, they could do that. The resources are there. On the other hand, if they are just getting their software out the door, they can pay weak rates for summer job kids, and tell their developers to yell and scream until they get the more interesting-sounding bugs narrowed down to something actionable. I remember a few irritated emails: &quot;I don&#x27;t really care that the button is out of alignment,&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m not paying for grammar advice,&quot; etc. My bad, buddy. Why don&#x27;t you talk to management about the conditions of your testing contract, and they&#x27;ll get one of those veterans on the job?

Those most opposed to euthanasia are likely to hold the belief that <i>all</i> human life is equally valuable, and there is no such thing as a life not worth living, and to support euthanasia and assist someone in actively taking his or her life, is to abet them in the mistaken belief that their life is not worth living.<p>The typical response to this is that euthanasia opponents are living in a dreamworld, and lying to themselves.  It is obvious at its face that some lives are not worth living, and to think otherwise is foolish.<p>On the other hand, the euthanasia opponent can reasonably ask how can we both support euthanasia and have suicide prevention hotlines?

7716264,comment,7714267,7714267,5,0,saurik,,,"The Apple App Store (which has been disclosed in earnings calls multiple years as only just barely in the black) handles your sales tax compliance for you (though the Google Play Store does not...), deals with refunds and complaints, isolates you from chargebacks (every customer that complains to their bank typically costs you an enforced $10-$20 per complaint in addition to the money), is handling your server distribution (fast bandwidth to send updates adds up for large applications that are updated often), provides licensing infrastructure (you don&#x27;t need to build some kind of &quot;enter your code&quot; DRM system with a bunch of servers that have to be online: you just give your app to the market and wash your hands of the problem; this is also often much easier when a user trades his device in due to a hardware issue: that&#x27;s the market&#x27;s problem), and is usually subsidizing a large population of free software that also accumulates complaints and infrastructure costs (and it is that large catalog of free stuff that often is causing your customers to have this experience installed anyway)... I run an app market, we charge 30% and end up with a fraction of that; I&#x27;ve had people who were additionally doing their own payment processing (we run an open ecosystem, and these people were not losing the distribution benefits of my market) stop and transfer all their existing license records to me, because I was simply providing them a more solid and convenient payment experience: they got to concentrate on building their app, and the price difference between their true costs of running this and what I was better spent improving their product and marketing efforts. Comparing to a real estate agent is really off, by the way, because the costs of doing transactions in hundreds of thousands of dollars is fundamentally different than doing transactions on a $1. The &quot;good rates&quot; (so throwing companies like Stripe out the door, which would cost $0.33 upfront) are still going to run you 10% the transaction cost, and the chargeback on a $1000 purchase is still going to cost the same $10-$20.",1399568000

Depending on the direction of the force, 10g for a minute would be close to the edge for untrained people but not expected to have long-lasting harmful effects in most cases.<p>There are several ways in which high g forces cause harm to humans. The article mentions blood flow, specifically applying the amount of acceleration necessary to stop oxygenated blood from reaching the brain. Completely stopping the flow of blood for 60 seconds <i>will</i> result in a loss of consciousness, but the designers of the coaster seem to be under the impression that achieving this even for a moment kills people. They&#x27;re wrong. If normal blood flow is restored after 60 seconds of anoxia, no adverse effects are to be expected at all, not even in the short term. Of course statistically there will be cases where the heart enters one of several possible failure modes under these conditions (again mostly in humans with pre-existing health problems) and while I expect it to be rare among the healthy population, those people would indeed need immediate medical attention - but they too can be expected to make a full recovery if they receive it.<p>High g forces can also damage blood vessels due to simple overpressure, causing them to rupture. This will happen with body parts located in the direction of the force applied. In this design, this will be the lower extremities, where this damage - if it occurs - will be minimal. But if you suspended people &quot;upside down&quot;, that would be another story. Overpressure in the blood vessels of the brain is a dangerous thing. Again, I&#x27;m not sure 10g for 60 seconds is enough, but I&#x27;d intuitively say if there was any way of inducing fatalities with this coaster that would be the way to go. Especially people with existing defects and weaknesses of the blood vessels in their brains would be most at risk, people with aneurisms for example.<p>Lastly, high g forces can cause tissue trauma due to compression or internal impact damage. 10g for 60 seconds would not be enough to cause that in healthy organs. But if the coaster&#x27;s design was changed to 20 or 30 g, delivered over an extended period, injuries and fatalities due to organ trauma (including the brain) will occur.<p>So on final consideration: this roller coaster will cause people to pass out for up to a minute. However, this effect is completely reversible. In healthy people, no lasting damage is expected.",1399567857

7716169,comment,7715833,7715833,9,0,evmar,,,"I work on an app that has made a similar tradeoff.  I won&#x27;t restate the positives because the post describes many of them (after all, we chose a similar architecture) but I&#x27;ll add that fetching app logic+assets (in the form of JS/HTML) from a server also lets us iterate on the app more quickly and without requiring the user to approve an update.  (Edit: oops, he actually did mention this in the post!)  And we get to use all our HTML-based testing tools (like automated screenshotting) to catch regressions.<p>Our app is also different in that we precache all the HTML in the background so we can always load it from disk rather than the network, which helps avoid any loading delays.<p>Here are some of the negatives I&#x27;ve encountered.  (My experience is solely with Android but I believe the basics are also true on iPhone.)<p>- There&#x27;s a long tail of details that are hard to get right.  E.g., handling multiple device DPIs, or getting navigation right (Android has a confusing mess of back vs up and tasks vs activities).  This is all solvable (after all, that&#x27;s why you&#x27;ve gone hybrid), but it ends up pushing more of your code native than you&#x27;d originally expect.<p>- There&#x27;s a delay on all click events on a webview.  This is probably worthy of a longer blog post but to summarize, there are at least two causes of this.<p>One is that by default click events happen 300ms after the touch event (I think due to it waiting for a double-tap?).  You can work around this by handling touch events specially (and there are JS libraries that claim to do it) but in practice it doesn&#x27;t work in all cases (e.g. some form controls can&#x27;t be worked around) and we ran into bugs on obscure devices (e.g. our users report they can&#x27;t focus a form control on certain Samsung devices; we even got one of those devices but couldn&#x27;t reproduce the problem).  Alternatively, the newer Chrome-based webview turns off this delay if your content&#x27;s meta tags indicate it&#x27;s not zoomable, but you can&#x27;t really rely on this because the Chrome-based webview isn&#x27;t widely deployed.<p>The other source of lag is that the &quot;active&quot; DOM state is <i>also</i> delayed, but by some other number and unrelated subsystem.  This means when you tap a button it&#x27;ll light up a bit after you tap it.  In my brief survey I think other mobile apps work around this by not having a prelight state.<p>Sorry to be full of bad news.  (Like I wrote above, I still think this architecture is the right tradeoff for my application&#x27;s purposes.)",1399566914

We patch the kernel regularly, allowing our customers to be protected without the hassle of rebooting.<p>Applying patches to the kernel to fix security vulnerabilities is orthogonal to knowing you can reboot your server. Rebooting servers is more than &quot;will it come back up&quot;, it also includes all the headache of scheduling and the risk of what happens if it doesn&#x27;t come right back up. But, because servers can and do crash, hardware needs to be upgraded, etc., you certainly need to know you can bring your system back up from a cold state.<p>Applying a hot fix means you are immediately protected from a vulnerability. Unless you are running at massive scale, few companies have an infrastructure that allows random servers to reboot (good on all those that do, regardless of scale!). Instead, most companies have systems and processes that make rebooting painful, especially for the IT guys who wind up working at 10pm on Saturday so they don&#x27;t affect most people.

Everything DHH mentions in this post is spot on as far as my experiences developing hybrid apps goes. I was on a project that was resource constrained but needed good mobile presence as well called kona.com that&#x27;s in the same problem space as Basecamp. We tried both the full native and full HTML5 routes but neither option worked for us. We didn&#x27;t have enough developers for our native apps to keep up with the web app and the HTML5 app (powered by Sencha) simply didn&#x27;t perform well enough on phones back in 2012.<p>After scrapping both those attempts I suggested we go with a hybrid app. We would lean heavily on javascript (angular.js in our case) and rely on native for access to native APIs and for UI elements that required better performance like the Facebook style drawer, slide up animations, the top and bottom nav bars, etc. It was the right mix between developer efficiency and app performance and allowed us to target not only Android and iOS with 90% of the same codebase, but also a native desktop app as well using Chrome packaged apps. We had written the main web app in JavascriptMVC but when I left the project we were just starting to port over the angular app to the main site, so eventually the same angular app would be powering the website, desktop app, iOS app, and Android app.<p>It only took one developer (myself) to manage the native code on Android and iOS and the logic was very similar in both places so it ended up being pretty simple to maintain. And as DHH mentions, setting up communication between your native code and your web code is easier than you&#x27;d think, although I am interested in hearing more about how they did it.<p>At any rate, DHH is totally right about the fact that most apps would be suited just fine by hybrid mobile apps as most apps are data heavy like Basecamp. Don&#x27;t tell that to native developers though because you will catch an earful about poor user experiences and maintenance hell, which in my experience is a bunch of FUD. The proof is in the numbers, and the Basecamp apps are well received (as were ours). The FUD around mobile apps and user experience reminds me of this post that showed up on HN last week: <a href=""https://medium.com/design-founders/f59c964513ef"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/design-founders/f59c964513ef</a>, which examines the failure of the assumption that meticulous, cutting edge design will guarantee success. In my experience, if you can get close to native but you solve the user&#x27;s actual problems (which is very rarely related to a lack of unique swipe gestures and translucent backgrounds) you are usually good to go. Why continue to deal with the pain and cost of having dedicated teams working on the <i>exact same app</i> for Android, iOS, Windows Phone, the Web, native desktop apps and god knows what else?",1399566489

Cooke had funding from NASA to develop SequenceL because evidently NASA was/is very interested in program correctness (it&#x27;s hard to guarantee correctness of a C++ program) and a simplified programming model.<p>The way Cooke explained it in class, SequenceL was born out of a desire for a simpler programming language (he believed that modern programming languages are too complex -  so many require extra tooling to be productive) and a desire to make the implementation of a program as close as possible to the definition of the problem. He reasoned that if you could make an executable specification (i.e. the definition of the problem was executable), then all the mistakes that implementers make while implementing a program based on the problem specification/requirements would go away. In other words, since the definition of the problem <i></i>would be<i></i> the implementation, zero implementation mistakes would be made.<p>Interestingly enough, the first SequenceL interpreter and compiler was written in Haskell.",1399566217

Moreover, the head teacher mostly blew me off when I complained about this -- apparently there is increased competition, and times are rough.<p>Increased competition, indeed. It is presumably a good time to find out if any yoga studio has taken up the niche that my old studio has mostly abandoned -- and your site claims to offer this information.<p>So I checked out your site. I&#x27;m afraid I didn&#x27;t find what I was looking for. You got the names and addresses of some local studios, and I&#x27;ll trust that you found out accurately whether or not they offer free mats or sell bottled water.<p>But what I really want to know:<p>(1) Which studios offer the most advanced classes? You list &quot;beginner&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, and &quot;advanced&quot; on your website, but these seemed a bit arbitrary. I didn&#x27;t really trust them.<p>(2) More to the point, I like training that is a little bit more &quot;sink or swim&quot; than is the norm in this town -- not in any bad way, but where the teacher wants to get you to Reverse Bird of Paradise Pose, and if you&#x27;re not getting there today, that&#x27;s okay! -- but the teacher is focusing on those who will.<p>I want to know <i>that</i> from browsing your site.

I do agree that asymmetric connections aren&#x27;t a good thing, but disagree on the &quot;chicken&quot; versus &quot;egg&quot; as you put it. I don&#x27;t think there will be <i>any</i> demand for greater upload bandwidth until <i>using</i> that bandwidth isn&#x27;t an <i>event</i> that totally swamps your connection and requires manual coordination with other users.<p>Upload traffic is theoretically able to be <i>precisely</i> prioritized, where a long-term file upload uses any extra bandwidth but adds <i>no</i> latency to other traffic (besides unavoidable pktsize/linerate). But easy/standard configs provide <i>best effort</i> shaping even if you go out of the way so that it is able to discern interactive ssh from uploading ssh. (And nevermind download shaping, which really requires application-level involvement to get predictability).<p>Static IPs could help as a nice crutch, in that they would enable us to start with current server-authoritative protocols and patch/configure them to deal with one-nine uptime. But conditions here are set, and static IPs are not a panacea - I have the option for $6/mo, but don&#x27;t take it. And I deal with the same fundamental undistributed service problems between my own machines on tinc.<p>So I don&#x27;t see much point trying to lobby ISPs for larger upload (esp when it goes against their technical constraints. I do have to wonder how the world would be different if digital computers had been invented before radio, causing p2p to be dominant over broadcast), without the software to make it <i>useful</i>. And I think that software has to be developed with the current conditions and the understanding that most people don&#x27;t want to have caring for a home server a prominent part of their lives.<p>(Now, maybe my tune would change if instead of 12M/1M DSL, I were on GigE where my upload throttling would be done by &quot;the cloud&quot; ;))",1399565520

They are essentially &#x27;pre-paid&#x27; computation.<p>Take the classic example, a search for &#x27;bilbo baggins&#x27;. What that is, is a request to identify documents on the web that have referred to Bilbo Baggins and return their locations.<p>1) It is absolutely true that you could sit down at your computer and look at each site, from aol to zillow, read all their pages, and note the ones that mention Bilbo. Then you could go back and order the list by the ones that had more of the information you were looking for to the ones with less useful information. Along the way you would find some sites that would not open up to you unless you had an account, those you could not visit.<p>2) A search engine can look at all the sites, it can note which sites mention Bilbo along with a bunch of other terms and can essentially &quot;pre-compute&quot; that list you were looking for. Along the way it will find sites that, through their robots.txt file, will say &quot;We&#x27;d rather you not look here.&quot; and it will respect that, thus not indexing those sites.<p>In both cases figuring out which web pages have information about Bilbo on them is creating &#x27;new&#x27; information out of existing data. You can do it on your own and it will cost you time, or you can do it with a few thousand machines and it will cost you money. Either way you get a list of possible sites.<p>That list forms a distribution, where there are a lot of sites that don&#x27;t care one way or the other if you read them, sites that won&#x27;t show up because they asked to be excluded, and sites that will show up because they <i>paid</i> to be included. Some sites really want you to find them, some sites really don&#x27;t. A good search engine caters to both types.<p>ii) If a search engine was taking the page, copying it, and then showing that instead of showing the page (this is what got Google&#x27;s news product in trouble) then its pretty clear that they should not do that. But in terms of location information? The sites themselves derive a huge economic benefit from being in the index that isn&#x27;t reflected at all back to the search engine that sent traffic there [1], so on a pure economic basis the search engine is on the losing side of that transaction. However, the marginal cost of additional transactions is small (search engines are general purpose) so they make a small amount on large volumes.<p>To put your question in more specifics, where is the economic value in the list; bobs middle earth atlas, wikipedia entry on bilbo baggins, middle earth web ring, imdb pages on characters in the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; movie.<p>Is it that Bob has an atlas of Middle Earth? Or is it the list itself? Who made the list? Bob or the search engine? (or some human curator of a bookmarks page[2])<p>iii) It is completely up to the site to allow or disallow access to its content by search engines. Some sites do only allow themselves to be indexed by Google and they find they get less search engine directed traffic that way. Some sites don&#x27;t allow anyone to index them and they get no traffic (sometimes they are surprised by this, sometimes they don&#x27;t care, sometimes they are angry that the only way for people to find them is to be in a search engine index)<p>[1] Google broke that by creating AdSense for Content and created a pretty interesting conflict of interest for themselves.<p>[2] Good luck finding a book marks page these days :-)",1399565338

We don&#x27;t just have failing schools, we have a failing institution that is, for the most part, accredited.",1399564973

Except that it could never actually work in practice---the infrastructure will see to that. Instead, it&#x27;s better to treat a TCP connection with a fixed port of 80 (or 443, if you&#x27;re so inclined) as precious and slather on some more bandaids until it stops not working at all.",1399564956

It seems to me that your startup is a boutique restaurant and so is not a good fit for a McDonalds-style franchise contract. However, at the end of the day, running a boutique restaurant is a lot more satisfying, at least in my opinion, and most of the time, more financially rewarding too. On the other hand, you do need authenticity to be a successful boutique restaurant owner, not the attitude &quot;we are disrupting XXX&quot;, &quot;we are changing YYY, one ZZZ at a time&quot;.",1399564944

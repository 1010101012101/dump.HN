The client connects to you, you impersonate Google by spoofing their IP (which you can do becase you control the peering point and routing tables), and using their certificate. Connect to Google simultaneously, spoofing the client&#x27;s IP. Use EDH to establish independent sessions to both the client and Google, with your (now essentially useless) perfect forward secrecy, MITM away.<p>Edit: replying to the poster below, it doesn&#x27;t have to be a passive attack, and I&#x27;m not sure what you mean about checksums. The scenario above would look exactly like normal Internet traffic. You&#x27;re not mutating packets, you&#x27;re sending entirely new ones.",1370660397

Having the TLS keys is still not having &quot;direct access&quot; to their network, since the NSA at no point accesses internals of their network. But the NSA gets all the data and decrypts it.<p>Next, NSA engineers spend time reverse-engineering the company&#x27;s protocols. Or maybe the companies hand over the specs. Anyway, the NSA can now recognize a request to Facebook representing posting a message; or it can recognize in Google&#x27;s traffic someone reading or sending an email. It can tell when a file is stored into iDrive.<p>It saves copies of all of this - the date and time of the request to Facebook, the message, etc.; for Google, the entire copy of the email, or search query.<p>NSA stores all of this data into a searchable, queryable database, that is capable of looking up a person&#x27;s activity in those systems.

Perhaps that is true, and the tapping happens at the Internet backbone level, without awareness by these companies (beyond giving up their TLS keys).<p>I think the question we need to ask Google, et al., is: did you divulge your SSL/TLS keys to any government, agent of the government, or any other entity?",1370659941

And we continue to stand firm against any attempts to do so broadly or without genuine, individualized suspicion, and publicize the results as much as possible in our Transparency Report.&quot;</i><p>He may be ignorant of that fact...however, that last statement, &quot;<i>as much as possible</i>&quot;, would cover that.

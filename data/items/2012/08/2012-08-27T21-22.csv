4441107,comment,4440808,4440808,3,0,hansef,,,"Like ""agile"", ""lean startup"" can mean pretty much... anything the person using the phrase wants it to mean.<p>With agile, sometimes the word is used to justify a rigid excess of ceremony, or as a firewall for lazy developers to hide behind to avoid being responsive to non-engineering members of the organization, or as an unrealistic attempt to turn software development into an assembly line of a bunch of jack-of-all-trades ""cross-functional"" team members (""specialists? we don't need no stinkin' specialists!""). But the core observation of agile is that writing huge planning documents and spending weeks perfecting PRDs and GANTT charts at the outset of an engineering project and then using these to derive project timelines and costs is inefficient, and that ""delivery to QA"" 3 months over an arbitrary schedule and 70% over an arbitrary budget is a classic failure mode for this approach to planning. Instead, a focus on building self-organizing, trusted teams who are delivering working software frequently and iteratively, and gathering customer feedback and adjusting ""the plan"" after each delivered increment of software can result in both happier developers AND happier customers.<p>Similarly, ""lean startup"" CAN be synonymous with ""changing my mind about what business I'm in and 'pivoting' every 3 weeks"", but really the core observation could be summarized as ""build things people want"", with all these new-fangled buzzword-y tools like customer development interviews, business model canvases and even ""pivoting"" as a means to this end. While the Ries book is useful, Steve Blank's The Startup Owner's Manual (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Startup-Owners-Manual-Step-By-Step/dp/0984999302"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Startup-Owners-Manual-Step-By-Step...</a>) is <i>phenomenal</i> and the ideas there certainly ""transfer very well outside the world of tech start-ups.""<p>Take what works, leave what doesn't, ignore the hype and think critically.",1346104332

They could just revoke API access for apps that don't show ads per their guidelines. It'd be easy to catch any Twitter client with a significant user base that isn't showing ads properly.<p>At the end of the day though solutions like this just aren't realistic. If Twitter's going to show ads and other content like cards in their stream, advertisers have to have confidence that the content and presentation will be preserved. The only way to truly do this effectively is to control how your product is presented in all cases.<p>The problem isn't that Twitter's making these changes. The problem is that Twitter's only getting around to doing this now, years after a vibrant ecosystem of third-party clients has been well established. No one complains that there isn't a rich market for third-party Facebook clients, even though the Facebook app historically has been pretty substandard. Facebook, wisely, never relinquished control over their platform.<p>Twitter, as ever, is cleaning up for previous incompetence, trying to clean up a mess that never should have existed. How could they not have assigned one or two people to build an iPhone client the minute the iPhone SDK was announced in 2008? How blind do you have to be to not anticipate that mobile will be huge for Twitter, a service originally engineered around being used over SMS?<p>Watching Twitter bungle issue after issue over the years gives the distinct impression that Twitter is successful in spite of their executive management, not because of it.",1346103836

The loss function quantifies how much your model sucks.<p>Ideally, your loss function should be the true loss, in real life. In a business, your true loss function is: -profit over the lifetime of the business. A lot of time it's difficult to measure the true loss, so your loss function should be a ""surrogate"" (approximation) of the true loss.<p>The author is poking around with techniques, without considering what he actually wants to optimize.<p>Brandon Ballinger said it well: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-keys-to-operationalizing-a-machine-learning-ranking-system-from-an-organization-engineering-management-point-of-view/answer/Brandon-Ballinger"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-keys-to-operationalizing-a...</a><p>""Make your success metric user happiness.

It's completely possible to have a model with a reduced error rate which lowers revenue, due to Simpson's paradox and a host of other reasons.""<p>The author of this post hasn't really considered these questions, and gets all hand-wavey about precision and recall vs. confusion matrices. How do you know that any of these are what you <i>really</i> care about?<p>So: What's the value of a false positive? What's the value of a false negative?<p>Here's where it gets interesting. For airport screening, one person might say that a false negative (terrorist slips through and kills 100 people) is 100M times worse than a false positive (I strip-search an innocent person). So this person has made a value judgment that the death of a random innocent person is 1 million times worse than humiliating an innocent person. The TSA, on the other hand, decides that a false negative is 100B times worse than a false positive, so they assign 1000 times as much value to catching terrorists vs. humiliating people as the other person.<p>Who's right? It's a value judgment, and machine learning can't answer that.<p>What I'm getting at here is that the choice of a loss function is ultimately an <i>aesthetic</i> decision.

I can redeem those points/miles for flight tickets, hotel bookings, in-kind purchases, etc. In that case, the exchange rate of the point is set by the dollar value of the reward that I'm purchasing. Usually rewards-based cards let you choose from a few options, so we can define the highest-valued reward to be the one that determines this exchange rate.<p>The credit card company can adjust this exchange rate at will, either to the benefit of the consumer or not. They can do this by awarding more/fewer points <i>or</i> by adjusting the value of the reward (by changing the number of points required to purchase a particular reward) - or both. This is analogous to the US government increasing/decreasing the money supply (and in fact, it has the exact opposite effect, since it's the credit card company doing it). In the case of airlines, frequent flyer miles have experienced dramatic inflation recently - if you had held onto your miles from, say, 2002, they'd buy you a lot less today (assuming they didn't expire altogether).<p>The credit card company can do this because they're acting as a central bank for the 'points' currency <i>and</i> as a monopoly (if you consider the products' parent companies, not the final branding), <i>and</i> as a monopsony (they are the only purchaser of the 'points' currency, so the only way to gain value from their points is to purchase their products - but they can set the prices of those products at will, since they're also a monopoly).<p>So, to circle back to your original question, the 'premium' is the difference between the constant cash rewards rate (say, 1%) and the 'effective' exchange rate of your points.<p>> I am skeptical of the actual worth of the points provided by various travel rewards cards. Here's an example: <a href=""http://www.delta.com/skymiles/use_miles/pay_miles/index.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.delta.com/skymiles/use_miles/pay_miles/index.jsp</a> -- the typical conversion rate for a ""mile"" is one point per ""mile"", is it not?<p>I share your skepticism - they can probably change the points-per-mile rate via the fine print (though that's a more cumbersome sword). More likely, though, they'll just change the dollars-per-mile rate (ie, 'how many points does $FLIGHT cost'), since that doesn't require notifying the customer of the updated terms of their card.<p>For that reason, the cash back cards are more reliable - why arbitrarily force yourself into a completely centrally-regulated market?",1346101390

Because it's just a protocol, so you can build a Facebook alternative on top of it, sure, but you can also build services equivalent to Twitter, Tumblr, LinkedIn, FourSquare, Instagram, Pinterest, Path, you name it, all interoperable. And the guys coming up with Tent don't have to be the ones who design the application layer. If they suck at UI/UX (which was questionable in the case of Diaspora), no problem, we can still build on their underlying tech.<p>Plus, it's not inherently noncommercial. With email you have three hosting options: free with ads, paid, and host it yourself. That's the best possible situation. On the one hand, companies are making money off ad-supported and paid email hosting, so they have incentives to provide the best service possible  unlike the non-profit ""community pods"" of Diaspora. On the other hand, you have interoperability and the freedom to use your data as you want  unlike on Facebook or Twitter, which will block you from exporting your contacts to a competing service. The Diaspora hosting model  where random people hosted servers for free just because they thought it was cool, or something  basically doesn't exist for email (or, say, web hosting), which is a good sign that it's unsustainable.<p>Diaspora was a flawed idea, but Tent, because it's a protocol, looks like a much more promising and realistic way to open social-media walled gardens.",1346101237

For those who don't want to wade through this technical and fairly lengthy article, here's a quick summary:<p>The people who say ""a calorie is a calorie, and to deny that would violate the laws of thermodynamics"" are arguing from the first law of thermodynamics (conservation), but misunderstand the second law (entropy). The article shows that if you take into account both laws of thermodynamics, then the statement ""a calorie is a calorie"" is actually a violation of the laws of thermodynamics.<p>The next two paragraphs are the conclusions of the article, quoted verbatim:<p>A review of simple thermodynamic principles shows that weight change on isocaloric diets is not expected to be independent of path (metabolism of macronutrients) and indeed such a general principle would be a violation of the second law. Homeostatic mechanisms are able to insure that, a good deal of the time, weight does not fluctuate much with changes in diet  this might be said to be the true ""miraculous metabolic effect""  but it is subject to many exceptions. The idea that this is theoretically required in all cases is mistakenly based on equilibrium, reversible conditions that do not hold for living organisms and an insufficient appreciation of the second law. The second law of thermodynamics says that variation of efficiency for different metabolic pathways is to be expected. Thus, ironically the dictum that a ""calorie is a calorie"" violates the second law of thermodynamics, as a matter of principle.<p>The analysis above might be said to be over-kill although it is important, intellectually, not to invoke the laws of thermodynamics inappropriately. There are also, however, practical consequences. The seriousness of the obesity epidemic suggests that we attack it with all the means at our disposal. Metabolic advantage with low carbohydrate diets is well established in the literature. It does not always occur but the important point is that it can occur. To ignore its possibilities and to not investigate the precise conditions under which it appears would be cutting ourselves off from potential benefit. The extent to which metabolic advantage will have significant impact in treating obesity is unknown and it is widely said in studies of low carbohydrate diets that ""more work needs to be done."" However, if the misconception is perpetuated that there is a violation of physical laws, that work will not be done, and if done, will go unpublished due to editorial resistance. Attacking the obesity epidemic will involve giving up many old ideas that have not been productive. ""A calorie is a calorie"" might be a good place to start.",1346101232

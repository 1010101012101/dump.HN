I can design circuit boards, find directions to a restaurant, read wikipedia, browse reddit and snap a photo to share with friends at a moments notice.<p>But in this constant frenzy of mental consumption in order to ward off the looming spectre of boredom, how do you find time to stop and collect your thoughts?<p>Having access to the sum of human knowledge (though not necessarily all of its parts) <i>is</i> amazing.  It&#x27;s also very distracting and can lead to a false sense of accomplishment based simply on the mental effort required to consume (and not necessarily retain) all of that content.<p>Kind of like going on a luxury cruise ship. There is always something to do, watch, eat - something fun, flashy, delicious.  But at the end of it, you&#x27;re exhausted.<p>What happens when the cruise never ends?",1379948396

6431373,comment,6430191,6430905,6,0,ihsw,,,"The impact of unchecked surveillance, like bad security, is impossibly difficult to quantify until shit hits the fan long enough for it to inconvenience people. Furthermore it&#x27;s simple and easy to dismiss serious problems as exceptions to the rule, for example Snowden was branded as &quot;very smart&quot; after there were claims that a &quot;high school dropout&quot; evaded NSA&#x27;s internal security systems and successfully escaped to Hong Kong.<p>If there are egregious violations of privacy and freedom then we won&#x27;t be seeing the admissions of guilt/reform, but instead we&#x27;ll be seeing recriminations and diversions. There needs to be punitive measures in place to deter that kind of negligence and recklessness, in addition to the punishment for actual violations.<p>Rehabilitation and recidivism are very serious issues that need to be focused on, especially because those who disregard privacy will do so on an ideological level -- it&#x27;s part of their personal belief system.",1379948259

That was kind of my point. I should perhaps have been more explicit about it. I was unsympathetic, but, hey, now that you mention the problem and make me think about it, I can see how most people could have problems with this; while for me it&#x27;s just plain obvious that you don&#x27;t ever take more than the recommended maximum dose because you don&#x27;t want to deal with side effects, other people do that with no expectation that <i>death</i> is a possible side effect.<p>As far as interactions, you&#x27;re right, it does interact with other drugs and non-drugs (the fact that lots of other OTC medications contain acetaminophen is also troubling, but a different issue in my mind), but in my experience as a guy who has to take a lot of painkillers and who&#x27;s married to a nurse who takes care of figuring out what&#x27;s safe, acetaminophen is one of the less worrisome drugs to deal with.

Now there is an exploit.. now the collective security researcher (and hacktivist) will work to make the hack easier by building a tool.. THERE lies the real danger.<p>I still commend Apple for trying.

Having children isn&#x27;t free. It&#x27;s actually one of the more expensive things you can do. Both for yourself and for society.

It&#x27;s true that working adults provide for people, but the money that creates those working adults can be more efficiently applied. It&#x27;s better to have a new company funded that provides employment to ten or twenty people and adds value to the economy than it is to have another person for whom work doesn&#x27;t really exist.<p>And this is before we get to the motivation of the children themselves:<p>Because, even from a pragmatic perspective, love is valuable.

A two hour on-site costs the company at least two hours engineering time, so you have to sort more aggressively in incoming applications - this puts those with &quot;high value brands&quot; (top universities and well known employers/internships) at an advantage over a maybe equally qualified candidate with an off-the-beaten-path CV. A complete-from-home test is much, much quicker and comfortable to &quot;grade&quot; and can thus be given out much more broadly.",1379946053

6431079,comment,6427029,6427283,3,0,smithzvk,,,"The FSF is about advocating for Free Software.  From their point of view (and I think this is mostly true) the conditions are in place where society doesn&#x27;t actually need to use proprietary software (outside of device drivers, and they are actively working to improve that situation).  Sure, you personally have to use proprietary software because the rest of the world does and proprietary solutions are often superior (either technically or in terms of usability), but we would get by fine, as a society, if we did away with proprietary software.  Further, so long as proprietary software is used by most people, and most developers are getting paid to develop proprietary software, technical superiority is almost guaranteed.  I think that the FSF long ago realized that the battle field is in public opinion, not in delivering quality software.  Sure, the software needs to be &quot;good enough&quot;, but once the software is &quot;good enough&quot; then no killer feature is going to shift people away from the proprietary software that they know and that the vast majority of the world is using.  Now, there could be meta-killer features in terms of responsive development, transparency, and privacy.<p>So, I can completely understand that the FSF feels that their time is best served by getting the public to change their views regarding Free Software vs proprietary software.  I don&#x27;t think that it has been very effective, but it is a heck of an uphill battle.  But doing this in combination with their other work (lobbying, writing briefs for court cases, acting as a GPL violator watch dog, and publicizing when large organizations have selected Free Software over a proprietary alternative) also help the cause more than funding any particular project I can think of.",1379945900

I think starting at version 5 they switched to one giant window and the community, pretty unanimously thought it was one of the worst UIs they had ever used (see this blog post: <a href=""http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2011/03/30/skype_5/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2011/03/30/skype_5/</a>).

Indeed many people reverted back to 2.8. I used 2.8 up until a few months ago when Skype finally decided to drop video support for it.<p>I think the newest version of Skype does let you break things into new windows, but to me it seems that it should be the default.<p>My main point is: the UI was already great, it didn&#x27;t need any changes.",1379945872

I&#x27;ll just throw out a scenario I tell everyone when it comes to buying Apple devices that&#x27;s strictly just financial and not exactly being an Apple &#x27;fanboy.&#x27;<p>Two options here, if you buy a phone on contract for say $200, then you can always sell it in a year, or even two, for around double of what you paid for it.  Example, iPhone 5&#x27;s are going for around $450 in my local market.  I just paid $200 a year ago for it on contract.  Some people hate contracts and say it&#x27;s cheaper to not have data or what have you, but like I said this is just this particular scenario if you are on a plan.<p>Option B, you can buy a device for full price, ie $650 and wait the year or two and sell it for ~$450 but now you have a gap of $200, but you still own the device outright.  Sometimes depending on what carrier, you can get an iPhone discount of $100 when not in your contract and that could bring it down to ~$550.<p>These examples exclude taxes and exclude some abnormalities with the pricing and buying markets such as unlocked > locked phones such as Verizon.  Verizon phones don&#x27;t have the same desire as AT&T phones because of the CDMA vs GSM difference with being able to use it on other prepaid carriers easily and worldwide use.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s my two sense from what I&#x27;ve learned over the years.  If you buy a phone on contract and take care of it, you&#x27;ll still get a great phone and double your money in a year when you go to sell it.  That&#x27;s how the markets have been treating them so far over the years.<p>Edit:  I will say that if you wait too long such as the large jump from 4 to 5S, the resale value on the 4 is now dipped to ~150-200.  So to me it makes more sense buying every release or two on contract, and then letting the phone pay for itself.",1379945215

6430932,comment,6429010,6430595,1,0,mdkess,,,"I&#x27;m certainly no Angular expert, so take my advice with a healthy amount of skepticism, but I think that it would be one element. The idea being that if I want to swap that stuff out for a new and improved quantity picker, I just change the directive. The idea of angular is that the HTML is supposed to make it clear what&#x27;s going on, so a single element isn&#x27;t a bad thing - it says, &quot;here&#x27;s the part that chooses quantities.&quot; Remember that you can nest directives too - so the meat of your page could look like:<p><pre><code>  <div ng-controller=&quot;QuoteCtrl&quot;>
    <shirt-chooser></shirt-chooser>
    <color-picker></color-picker>
    <size-picker>
       <size-picker-choice label=&quot;SM&quot;></size-picker-choice>
       <size-picker-choice label=&quot;MD&quot;></size-picker-choice>
       <size-picker-choice label=&quot;LG&quot;></size-picker-choice>
       <size-picker-choice label=&quot;XL&quot;></size-picker-choice>
    </size-picker>
    <number-picker></number-picker>
    <order-summary></order-summary>
  </div>
</code></pre>
And then your directive figures out what that means in terms of rendering. But now, the nice thing is that I can just substitute that with <my-size-picker> and, assuming I fulfill the contract, everything should continue to work.<p>Now you get the added benefit that you can test directives individually, as well as the whole controller. Right now, if you do some restructuring of the page, you could end up in a situation where you break all of your test cases. I mean, in this case it might be overkill, but as a general principle I think it&#x27;s the right approach.<p>Anyway, looking forward to see what you do next!",1379944926

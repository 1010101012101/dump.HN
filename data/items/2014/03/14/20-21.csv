Now that the system is off: tap the power button.<p>Modern systems (whether server, desktop tower or laptop) have a &quot;soft&quot; power button, that when tapped briefly sends a signal to the OS.

All of this has been true for quite a few years now.<p>If the system is so locked up that the power button initiated shutdown doesn&#x27;t work, you might as well just pull the power, which holding the button down for a second or two will do. Even if this happens, you&#x27;re probably using a journaling filesystem that comes back up cleanly.<p>None of that will help with unsaved data in an application, because you almost certainly have to tell the application to save, and if X has locked up there is no way to do that.

Pinto seems to have treated subprime loans as non-liar’s loans, but that is clearly incorrect.  I cited Credit Suisse’s finding that by 2005 and 2006, half of all subprime loans were also stated income (liar’s loans).  The presence of such large amounts of Alt-A loans is one of the demonstrations that Pinto, Wallison, and the Republican Commissioners’ “Primer” are flat out wrong to claim that it was affordable housing goals that drove Fannie and Freddie’s CEOs’ decisions to purchase loans they knew would cause the firms to fail.  That claim doesn’t pass any logic test.  One of its unobvious flaws is that no one was making Fannie and Freddie buy liar’s loans.  For the reasons I’ve explained, and Pinto admits, Fannie and Freddie actions with respect to liar’s loans were the opposite of what they would have been if they were trying to demonstrate that the loans were made for affordable housing purposes.</i><p>The GSEs were deeply irresponsible with their lending and were poorly run, but both were prevalent long before any CRA impact would have been felt. If AEI / Pinto / Wallison had focused on the actual causes of the mortgage / financial crisis instead of trying to blame poor people and Barney Frank, the world would be a lot better off.<p><a href=""http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/02/wallison-is-far-too-kind-to-fannie-and-freddie/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/02/wallison-is-far-too-kin...</a>",1394829541

Is it the best solution though? If the product is good, slowing down on features or customers seems fairly acceptable until you can cope with them.

So if you&#x27;re from the North East or the West Coast, you can&#x27;t really do much to keep Uncle Sam&#x27;s hand out of your pocket, at which point it becomes extremely attractive to put in for your own boondoggles to try and claw some of it back.<p>It&#x27;s not ideology, it&#x27;s political arithmetic.

7401472,comment,7398926,7400360,1,0,nostrademons,,,"I did some Googling.  &quot;back pressure&quot; in the Node context is basically what most people refer to as &quot;flow control&quot; or &quot;overload behavior&quot;.  Node programs work by enqueueing a bunch of work items for the event loop to handle, and then going on and doing a bunch more stuff until all the work items have been handled and their callbacks have been called.  In the process, those callbacks may themselves enqueue further work items.<p>The problem is that all these callbacks themselves take up memory and hold onto references in the V8 heap.  And so if callbacks are being enqueued faster than they can be processed, the heap will get more full.  V8&#x27;s GC takes time proportional to the amount of live data, and so GCs will become more frequent and take longer.  This further reduces the amount of available CPU time to process callbacks, which increases the amount of live data, until the system thrashes to a halt.<p>Haskell programmers (who use a similar scheduling mechanism for lazy evaluation) call this a &quot;space leak&quot;, and it&#x27;s a big problem in Haskell as well.  The solution is for the runtime to let the calling code know that it&#x27;s overloaded, and then either temporarily block the calling code from creating more callbacks until existing ones have run, or let the calling code gracefully degrade and choose to handle things in a simpler fashion.",1394827739

There are no oil, spark plug or fuel filter changes, no tune-ups and no smog checks needed for an electric car.&quot;<p>Well then what about BMW with bumper to bumper service as only one example. That&#x27;s a high end car that you don&#x27;t pay for service for (iirc) 3 years. They cover everything. Wiper blades you name it. I think last I checked the same was true for Subaru and I think even Jeep Chrysler is doing this (may be wrong about that one).<p>And that&#x27;s not a conflict of interest but rather a business model. In the case of cars which do make money from service they therefore in theory have a lower price for the vehicle.<p>This argument is like saying that you are a better airline because you don&#x27;t charge for luggage. Presumably that extra revenue allows you to offer lower ticket prices. And surprise that is what happens. Back when airlines were regulated (and had less competition) and they charged way higher prices they didn&#x27;t have to nickle and dime you to make a profit.",1394827552

It was more like extending knowledge I already had, than having to learn something completely new. The slowest part was trying to determine which modules met my needs, then sorting through the myriad of somewhat confusingly- (or just plain badly-) written documentation.<p>The best part was being able to use the same language end-to-end.

This project flowed much more naturally and left me quite enthusiastic about whatever the next one is (I get a lot of latitude in devising solutions).<p>Some of the code is probably badly-written and I&#x27;ll spend some time cleaning that up (first project in Node) for an update and there are still a couple of parts to write (shell scripts, mainly). There&#x27;s also one key part that no-one seems to be able to solve (MD5 in Mono won&#x27;t match the MD5 from JS), but we&#x27;ll figure that out as we can ignore it, for now.<p>Really, given all the interruptions I faced during the process, going from zero to finished in two weeks of eight-hour days (including having to learn some things) feels pretty good.<p>The same project in PHP would have taken about the same amount of time, without having to learn new things.

Go watch a Congressional hearing on a tech issue. Tell me you think more of us shouldn&#x27;t be sitting in that room setting the record straight. Congress should represent all people, and include all professions like engineers and developers, not to mention people under 40.<p>Also, we&#x27;re just a few weeks into the campaign, but next week I&#x27;ll be posting a more detailed policy platform on <a href=""http://coleforcongress.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coleforcongress.com</a>, so I hope you&#x27;ll sign up and stay engaged.<p>To the cynics, as I said in the comments of the article:<p>> Yes, the influence of money in elections is corrupting, but I refuse to give up on the idea of representative democracy. I&#x27;m willing to fight for it, even if the deck seems stacked. I see no shame in giving it my all.<p>> And it&#x27;s a simple formula for how we win: less money from more people vs more money from less people. If people like you and me who recognize the system is broken put our necks on the line, work together, and contribute what we can, we will win. There are more of us who want to fix the system than those who benefit from it.<p>> So why not join me? <a href=""http://coleforcongress.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coleforcongress.com</a>",1394827328

However, we&#x27;ve now got a great designer working with us, and we&#x27;ll have a new look in a few weeks. Others have mentioned wanting images for projects, and that&#x27;s definitely something we&#x27;re considering. However, we have to balance it with not wanting to make it hard for people to post projects.<p>A lot of charities, for example, are already tentative about asking programmers for help, and we&#x27;re a bit concerned that asking them to produce a pretty picture could put them off posting. Ideas for how to have the look without putting off posters are very welcome.",1394827317
7401433,comment,7399058,7399058,5,0,Zigurd,,,"Google&#x27;s method to keep OEMs in line is not without costs. For example, you can get Amazon, Kindle, Amazon App Store, and Audible for Google-logo Androids, but you can&#x27;t (officially) get Google&#x27;s suite of apps for Kindle Fire devices. Kindle Fire devices are a large percentage of tablets that run Android OS and are compatible with 3rd party Android apps.<p>At some point, Google might re-think this equation. Perhaps as a way of &quot;participating&quot; inside China without officially being there. Perhaps if Microsoft really does ship an &quot;AndroidAsha&quot; and it catches on.<p>So far, Google has played clean. Google has done nothing to interfere with Amazon&#x27;s business selling devices running Google&#x27;s Apache-licensed code. Contrast that with Sun&#x27;s FUDding the crap out of anyone using an open source Java implementation.",1394827316
7401432,comment,7401029,7401029,1,0,larrys,,,"&quot;Moreover, it is much harder to sell a new technology car from a new company when people are so used to the old. Inevitably, they revert to selling what’s easy and it is game over for the new company.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s total BS. Any dealer who invests money in a new show room to sell a new brand of car (think of Mini which was picked up by many legacy BMW dealers and is sold in many mini only showrooms) is going to put in the effort to sell the product. We aren&#x27;t talking about putting Teslas on the same floor as Mercedes. It would be trivial for Tesla to insist that the product be sold out of a dedicated facility which would cost a dealer money to construct. The idea that that dealer would simply push another product (or the salesman) in another showroom that he operates is ridiculous. And contrary to the behavior of existing multi line large dealerships.",1394827310

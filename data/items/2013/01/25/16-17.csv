One of my fondest memories (and possibly one of my best life memories) is travelling around the US for three months with my best friend. I will likely never replicate that experience.<p>But that said, I just took a four day trip to Germany by myself and I loved it. I think I spoke less than thirty words to anyone on most of those days, and found it tremendously relaxing to just walk around a museum by myself, alone in my thoughts. I took a three hour train ride to Poland just because I wanted to, and I loved sitting there by myself watching people in rural East Germany go about their business. It's a lot more difficult to be a fly on the wall when you're with someone, because the minute you open your mouth it's evident you are an outsider.<p>But on the other hand, I'm extremely reluctant to approach complete strangers and strike up conversation. When I'm with someone, it happens naturally. When I'm by myself, I will be alone for the duration of my trip.",1359133193

Note AAPL is only making that much per Q for the second time in its history. In 2011 it made only 60% of what it makes now. In 2010 30%. If someone can guarantee that AAPL will continue its profitability at its present level of course it is very undervalued. But there is no guarantee and right now it looks like that investors does not give it a very high chance. Just to maintain its current pace AAPL needs to sell close to 200B this year or about $30 to every single person on the planet. But that is not enough it will have to do that year after year for an extended period of time. You say P/E of 10 -- then you better be able to do what you are doing for at least 10 years. And that is always hard to see for tech once a company stops growing -- so called inflection point.

I too became fed up of mates not being able to come with me so in the end thought fuck it, I'll go on my own.  The day I posted my plans my mate got in touch and said he'd come with me for 3 weeks.<p>Those 3 weeks we basically argued like a married couple, there were good times, obviously, but we are both very different people.  Anyway, as soon as he left me in Cambodia, the trip turned into one of the best experiences of my life.<p>I went where I wanted, I did what I wanted.  I had crazy nights out and the trip was an adventure.  I went to see my friend in Koh Phangan and stayed at his dive shop for a few weeks for free.  I made friends with the locals and regularly got invited out with everyone.  I had 2 of the most unbelievable experiences of my life partying in Haad Riin.  I ended up with a girlfriend for 3 months whilst I was there.  I met up with an old friend in Malaysia and stayed with her for free in a 5 star hotel for a week - she was on business and got a twin room for me.  I met a girl in Bangkok who ended up driving me around the city in her Range Rover and taking me out to clubs.  One day I decided to rent a motocross bike and rode it 35km up to the top of Bokor mountain in Cambodia - an amazing experience, more so on the way back down.<p>All of these things happened when I was on my own.  Once I left my friend, I could do exactly what I wanted.  There were times when it was hard, e.g. going to clubs on your own, or places where everybody is in a group, but in the end it paid off.  Now I'm the guy who just does what he wants.  This year I'll go away again to maybe South Korea or the Philippines; I haven't even considered asking someone to go with me.<p>So yeh, don't be that guy stressing about not having anyone to go places with, fuck it, go on your own.",1359132670

Most servers use their own preference (SSLHonorCipherOrder in mod_ssl).<p>So removing 3DES doesn't do anything because none of the connections will be using it anyway as everyone prefers RC4 or AES. The only cases where it would be used is if the client supports almost nothing else. In that case, you're just breaking the client.<p>Far more important is that the text is recommending DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA as the most preferable ciphersuite. The benefit of AES-256 over AES-128 are almost nil in this case, because AES is not your weakest link. And the cost of DHE is substantial.<p>Disabling DHE removes forward security, but results in substantially faster handshake times. Ideally the text would discuss this tradeoff and how ECDHE gets you the best of both worlds to some extent.<p>Given that most sites are going to nullify forward secrecy with non-ephemeral SessionTicket keys in any case, RSA-AES128-SHA or RSA-RC4-SHA are reasonable choices for the casual site. Certainly better than just using HTTP.<p>The points about Keep-Alive is fine and caching are fine, but not specific to HTTPS.<p>Minimising domains and serving complete chains is correct, but just telling people not to miss intermediates is unhelpful: put your site into ssllabs.com and it'll tell you if you need to fix your certificate chain.",1359131921

To get a true picture one needs to account for all those as well.<p>The beauty of Amazon's model is that it uses little to no capital (all operations can be funded by negative working capital and other liabilities incidental to operations), so it can expand unconstrained by capital needs, as long as it can find new customers.",1359131621

You'd be hard-pressed to find a native SF'an in your daily interactions. (I know just a couple, and I've been here 6 years). As a result, many of them don't vote; or if they do, they don't have the context to see through the bullshit that is put out there. They'll take a politician's word, when a long-term resident will remember that that fucker has been lying for 20 years.\nAs a corollary to this, you can control the City if you can put together a decent-sized voting block. So, for example: the City has 25,000 employees. If you can get the City employees on your side, then their votes alone are enough to swing most elections in your favor. For example: many years ago, the MUNI drivers got the City Charter amended to guarantee that they would be at least the second-highest paid drivers in the nation! Can you even imagine the clout they had to modify a city's constitution? (Thankfully, this was repealed a couple of years ago).<p>Secondly: the City has a lot of money to spend. The people in power stay in power via a huge game of doing (and getting) favors. For example: the City spends over $500 million/year on various ""non profits"". Your non-profit won't get a dollar unless you employ ""consultants"" who will help you write the proposal; and these consultants are very well-connected people. And they get a ton of money for a few days work (it's not uncommon to see such consultants be on payroll making $300K at a non-profit, but noone ever sees them at work).<p>Thirdly: the City is exceedingly corrupt. If you know the right people, you can get away with anything. This is why you have leeches like (Slick) Willie Brown and Rose Pak running the show. They know how the system works, and make a living just by greasing the wheels and pulling strings.<p>This is why, during elections, I vote for the people who are the most removed from the corridors of power. Anyone who has had anything to do with the System doesn't get my vote. It may be like throwing the baby out with the bathwater, but the City needs an enema.",1359131400

The more expensive the gear, and the higher the numbers, the more some poor sap will just NEED it before he can produce good cuts.<p>""Science can't measure what I'm hearing"" - 90% of audio engineers when discussing over-priced gear.<p>While I agree that a <$200 microphone probably won't cut it if you're going for a up-front, nuanced vocal, I do firmly believe a 3.5k microphone being overkill. Put someone in a good room, with a decent mic, and a good engineer, and <i>no one</i> will ever know that a U-87 wasn't used. If you opt for the digital, modeled version of the API 2500, rather than the hardware version, what happens? Song ruined? Audiophiles won't buy the record out of spite? Nope.

While it sucks for the workers at the plant that they're probably going to lose their jobs (shitty work is [usually] better than no work), the jobs aren't actually going away.  They're just being shifted to another factory that now has the knowledge that they too could be fired for what Westerners consider egregious working conditions.<p>This is great, and the outcome of putting a lot of vocal and consistent pressure on Apple to behave in a less inhumane fashion.  It's yet another example that well organized and vocal campaigns can result in meaningful change.  They do take a while, though.",1359130891

If I don't see the issue with what I wrote, then I suspect a bug in the deeper layers or a lack of understanding of the deeper layers on my part, so I begin to isolate everything and do the equivalent of unit test each part to ensure it works as expected. Even if it's the most obvious thing I check it anyway.<p>Needless to say I sketch things out a bit beforehand (sometimes by writing throw away code), then I write the code little pieces at a time, then I immediately test each section of code I've written while it's fresh in my mind. This helps ensure that what I'm writing doesn't run away from me.<p>Sometimes I write large amounts of code just to get better at debugging when the amount of code written is large, and to beat myself into make less mistakes, and to improve my ability to hold more in memory without getting confused or losing track of what I'm doing. Sometimes just to prove to myself that I can do it. I just do it again and again until I beat myself into submission. After every mistake or failure to do things the way I expect I say, ""No, it's possible. No, it's possible,"" then I start again.<p>Working at a 9-5 for sometime, especially at a large shitty company, is often enough to have the ability to do this beaten out of you by less capable or stuck-in-their-ways Engineers who insist on saying you have to do things this way or that way or you'll have problems. Eventually you may get sick of their stupidity and begin to act out to find ways to keep yourself sharp, to prevent being watered down, and to keep things moving.<p>Just remember it's possible to get better at cranking out line after line of code without making very many mistakes, and it's possible to adjust the way you write code in such a way that if errors are introduced they'll be blatant and easy to identify.",1359130766

There are about 20 memebers in it and we share stuff between each other by email occasionally but also make plans.<p>The second thing I learned was never to entice people or make plans, but simply to <i>announce</i> plans. I'd email the group:<p>""I'm going hiking at Franconia Notch this weekend if anyone is interested. Leaving from my house around 10AM Saturday.""<p>That's it. No waiting for replys, no waiting on people at all. If you want to come with me you'll be around at 10AM Saturday or you won't.<p>There's no frustration if its only me going, as I intended to go alone, and if anyone wants to come along then that's a pleasant surprise. But I won't base my activity schedule around waiting for them.<p>Surprisingly, since I started doing this, <i>more people seem to come along.</i> Motivation is contagious, I think, and it seems the thought of someone else already 100% committed to doing something makes it easier in the minds of others to commit themselves.<p>So make it easy for your friends. This way they don't feel guilty or obligated one way or the other, which is a huge relief for some personality types.<p>Later, I made a second google group for announcing house dinners, and now regularly 5-15 people show up every wednesday and we cook and eat together.",1359130668

The main contention seems to be between those who use inflation as a measure of cost of living, and those who use it as a measure of policy-driven change in the value of money.  Both views have their uses.  Personally, I prefer the growth in money supply view because it seems to be less susceptible to manipulation by an agenda.  The basket of goods is by necessity a small sample of the total cost of living, and I think that the main complaint lodged against it is that the goods are chosen and changed over time in order to portray a picture that's better than it would otherwise be. shadowstats.com has more information on how the CPI changes with selections in the basket of goods.<p>Using the money supply as the definition of inflation gets closer to the viewpoint I care about, which is trying to get a sense of how policy is changing the value of my savings and income.  I like to look at a simple ratio of money supply growth to GDP growth for some idea of how policy is changing the value of money, but this too is fraught with danger because it ignores important things like technical innovation, changing resource bases, and money velocity.  So, I think it's a matter of personal preference and probably the best policy is to look at it from as many angles as possible if it's something that's important for your decision making.",1359130661

Most victims of overly aggressive prosecution are disadvantaged racially, socio-economically, educationally, and are often addicts in need of medical treatment.  Aaron was privileged in all these ways which most people in the grips of our legal system are not; and while his privileges don't lessen the tragedy of his death or the injustice of his situation, they are the reason his name has national recognition at this point.  Describing the situation as ""Aaron Swartz was Screwed by the War on Drugs"" ignores the millions of other nameless, faceless people who have also been screwed by it.

(For instance, here is an ipython notebook export with interactive ggplot-style faceted plots of a Pandas DataFrame: <a href=""http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/ContinuumIO/Bokeh/blob/master/tests/web/bokeh-facets.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/ContinuumI...</a>)<p>This kind of composite plot is a one-liner in the grammar of graphics.  It would be much more with Matplotlib or Chaco.  There are also marvelous novel graphics that are possible with Protovis-style Marks & Glyphs: <a href=""http://mbostock.github.com/protovis/ex/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mbostock.github.com/protovis/ex/</a>  Although these are technically possible with existing libraries, the amount of programming skill required to create them is outside the capability of most data analysts.  Our goal with Bokeh is to make these all accessible to that larger audience.",1359130341

If my prediction is wrong? Well, life goes on. People got on just fine before the invention of cell phones. If it's a multi-hour journey and I will be substantially delayed, again, I pull off to make the call; usually there's a rest stop somewhere reasonably accessible.<p>Do you really think that your life is so important that you must put other people's lives at risk just to give an ETA of when you'll get there, and you can't be bothered to just plan a little in advance?<p>Of course, most of the time when I'm in the car, it's with someone else.

He is mad smart, but all of his focus is going towards school work, none of which is tech related. He just can't find motivation to work on his own stuff, and I think it would be beneficial if he learned to program and could see how powerful it is. Right now he wants to do chemical or materials engineering, and honestly I don't know how much programming he would use but I figure it couldn't hurt. However in the past he was interested in EE, so it would be really helpful if he got a head start.<p>My question is, how do I convince him to give it a try, and what should I first teach him. I think the best way to learn is through online resources, and I could help him if he gets stuck along the way. He has taken a class on HTML/CSS and liked that he could see changes he made visually, but found it a little dry. He also had an Arduino which he tried to do some stuff on but he had did not find any good resources to learn how to use it. I was thinking maybe he would enjoy basic game programming, something like Pygame. Python is what I learned on and making games, while not necessarily related to engineering is a rewarding way to learn. The other option is to expose him to C++ right away, but I think he has a bad view of programming already, and learning something with more of a learning curve might not be best for him.<p>What do you guys think would be beneficial for a future engineering student.

But there are several interpretations of that statement in which it is correct.",1359129747

The availability and price of our technology is dramatically (like an order of magnitude) lower than it used to be.  The Wired article was accurate at the time, but its pricing data is now way, way out of date.  Also, about automated responses:  believe it or not, even in the case of a school shooting, it still takes about 3-4 minutes for a call to 9-1-1 to deliver enough information for emergency responders to get the information they need.  That's probably the vector for the most meaningful improvement in response time.  We're looking at this very closely.",1359129733

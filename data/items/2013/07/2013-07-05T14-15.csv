Now that everyone has high-resolution displays web elements tend to be built at larger sizes to get the same effective size on the newer screens.

So rather than going the traditional &quot;let&#x27;s do a startup&quot; route, we&#x27;re following the foundry model.<p>Paul Birch, my co-founder had been investing in some pretty well-known companies for a few years, and wanted to get back to the craft. I&#x27;ve been doing lots hacks, and wanted to do something around taking rapid experiments and turning them into businesses (if they worked). Nick Marsh, the other co-founder is from a design background, and was similar inspired about building a studio that builds digital products. He talks about the Eames Studio of the 21st century.<p>We looked at a number of hacks for our first product, and picked Bitsy because we thought it would be quick to hack (we were wrong!), had a good prospect of being revenue positive early, gave a leg up to the little guy (our core proposition as a company), and it was about enabling people that we know to sell digital products online easily.<p>I have a bunch of friends who could or should be selling online but don&#x27;t know where to start. Being unable to price for the UK market, having to set up a paypal account, the legal issues involved, are all barriers for those people, and we wanted to make a very easy way for them to do that. With some elegance (Jon Gold is on the team), focusing on selling socially (via Twitter, Facebook and so on), and in a way that supplements the marketplaces. If you&#x27;ve done the hard work selling something, why give away a large percentage other than for payment processing?<p>From a US point of view, it probably looks like a solved problem, but in the UK it&#x27;s really not. So that&#x27;s where the initial motivation came from - help our friends, and people like them, make income from the digital things they make.",1373036213

And powerful social forces can conspire to keep him there.</i><p>My observation is that mental illness often has a hurricane-like property wherein the storm is bearable but the social fallout (looting, arson, opportunistic crime) afterward is far more destructive. The disease itself is unpleasant but bearable. People are not.<p>In a high-stress society like corporate life in the U.S. or Japan, everyone will have deviances from perfect mental function. One would wish for them to have negative autocorrelation (self-correction). Instead, those deviations are often pushed <i>further</i> by external forces. Sometimes it&#x27;s intentional (ambitious rivals want to thin out competition) but normally it&#x27;s just an artifact of the stupid stigmas around these diseases. (&quot;He&#x27;s depressed, not a team player.&quot;)<p>People <i>really</i> don&#x27;t understand these problems. They think a &quot;panic attack&quot; is that time they hit a heart rate of 120 because they drank too much caffeine before a deadline. No, that&#x27;s not panic (that&#x27;s mild anxiety). Panic attacks throw about 50 different symptoms (you have to have a few before you see them all) of which any one of them would feel like an acute, life-threatening crisis to a sane person. Almost everyone who has a true panic attack will end up in the ER, the first time. You have to cycle through all of the bizarre symptoms a few times before you realize that the attacks aren&#x27;t dangerous. Once you&#x27;ve learned this, they&#x27;re just annoying (&quot;shit, there goes the next 10 minutes&quot;) but the first few attacks are devastating because they feel <i>real</i>.<p>I also think that the corporate world <i>creates</i> laziness and depression, not in the blase Dilbert sense, but because people who are conditioned to associate work with subordination turn either into disengaged clock-punchers (steal from the system, because it will steal from you) or useless, delegating executives. We think our society values <i>work</i>, but given the increasing association between work and subordination, isn&#x27;t that indicative of the opposite?<p>Society effectively programs people to lose motivation and shut down, then stigmatizes people who do so-- whether because of conditioning or an unrelated biological problem-- even if it&#x27;s only for a week or two. I think the &quot;test&quot; of the dues-paying grunt work is whether a person can keep going in spite of recurring negative signals (subordination, artificially delayed advancement, repetitive busy-work without the leeway to automate it or render it unnecessary) but the truth is that that&#x27;s a stupid fucking test.",1373034746

Meat is much easier to preserve than produce in such a way that&#x27;s acceptable to fast food consumers (especially when you&#x27;re already eating THAT much salt!), meaning large chains like McDonald&#x27;s wind up bringing more operations challenges in house as they add produce. This translates to a reduction of cost/revenue predictability, which at least initially might need to be mitigated by increased margins.<p>Having never worked at the kind of scale at which McDonalds operates it&#x27;s hard to say whether or not these challenges are insurmountable. However my hunch is that if the demand was there, McDonalds would figure it out. They have a remarkable amount of resources that could be poured into these problems.

Much like EU membership, most people who want hanging, or to leave the EU, won&#x27;t vote against you if you disagree with them on that - they will choose who to vote for on something else. Woe betide any pro-death penalty politician though - as many people would vote against them for this reason (maybe not so much with the EU,) thus, politicians in the 80s and 90s were by and large anti-death-penalty, even though a referendum on it would have brought it back.<p>This, by the way, is not &quot;undemocratic&quot; or anything - it&#x27;s about what issues are <i>important</i> to people, as well as their direct opinion (this is why many polls about the EU in the UK are misleading - people don&#x27;t like it, but it&#x27;s not very important to them.)

10652794,comment,10651617,10652338,0,0,pdkl95,,,"HN readers in particular should consider how technology has affected an important part of J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s political extortion: COINTELPRO[1].<p>Technology has made it a <i>lot</i> easier to discredit and disrupt political activists. An obvious example of how to map relationships to find potential organizers that might bring together a larger political movement is the NSA programs COTRAVELER[2], but the methods are not that different from &quot;targeted advertising&quot; or any Facebook-style social network.<p>Occupy terrified a lot of people in power specifically because it didn&#x27;t have an obvious minimum spanning tree to target.<p>We even have documents from Snowden about GCHQ&#x27;s version[3]. JTRIG even has a wide assortment of tools[4] available for disrupting and discrediting their targets. Their tool for &quot;amplification of a given message, normally video, on popular multimedia websites (Youtube)&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem particularly useful for national defense or catching terrorists - they have <i>other</i> tools for feeding a specific target false information. On the other hand, amplifying the popularity of a video would be <i>very</i> useful for propaganda.<p>Obviously very little of this is <i>proof</i>. It was already frightening what J. Edgar Hoover was able to do decades ago. How would the same thing be done with the benefit of modern technology? Would you even notice it?[5]<p>A even better question might be: given how eagerly the advertising industry used tracking technology and data mining, would you consider it likely that a government agency with little restraint or oversight would refrain from doing the same thing?<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/world/how-the-nsa-is-tracking-people-right-now/634/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/world/how-the-nsa...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/gchq-catalog.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/gchq-catalog.html</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRzYJullFOs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRzYJullFOs</a> (14 seconds of Max Headroom)",1448927985

Essentially, anyone connecting to a forwarded port on any of our VPN gateways could have their real IP address leaked to an attacker specifically targeting a PIA user.<p>Within 12 hours of the initial report, we developed and tested what we thought was a complete fix, and deployed it to all of our VPN gateways.<p>On November 26, the researchers who discovered the vulnerability made it public and we quickly noticed that our service was still vulnerable to the IP address leak in certain cases, despite our initial fix. After further investigation, we also realized there was a separate but related issue on our desktop client. To fix this issue we are releasing updated VPN apps to prevent any leaks. We released v.52 on November 27.<p>Protecting your privacy is our top priority and although exploiting this vulnerability is difficult and requires an attacker to specifically target you, we feel like we let you down with our initial response. Please accept our apologies, we are sorry.<p>We highly recommend users update to v.52 (or later) of the client.

We don&#x27;t always arrive at a consensus or an objective truth by airing our differences. So let&#x27;s be clear before embarking on that path, that we may just manage to create a very candid fog of strong opinions, as different subjective truths battle it out.<p>* In a culture that values candor, all liars are candid. That is, promoting candor does not solve the underlying dynamic, which is that one side will likely win and one will lose, and not every side is fighting for the right reasons.<p>* In a culture that values candor, bosses get to be candid first. That is, there is a real risk of feedback flowing from HQ to the trenches and not vice versa. Beware of candor as privilege.<p>Anyone who needs this type of advice should just go straight to &quot;The Hard Thing About Hard Things&quot; by Ben Horowitz.

How do we get there?  One thought is that you need more software engineers to start designing hardware and then they will scratch their own itch for better tools and the rest will be history (similar to how we got Open Source compilers, OS&#x27;s, etc.).<p>I don&#x27;t see that happening.  More likely the software developers who are already in the field will see the light and start sharing code.  Who are these software developers in the field?  Well, the Big 3 EDA companies employ quite a few, but really everyone who writes Verilog or VHDL is already a software developer.  Sure, they probably need to learn a new language before they go hack on a logic simulator (vhdl isn&#x27;t the write language for that job), and maybe a new technique or two, but it&#x27;s not as huge a stretch as everyone makes it out to be.  They design microprocessors, networking chipsets, caches, PCIe root complexes for crying out loud, they have a better foundation in computer programming than the vast majority of &quot;programmers&quot; do.

If I have to perform another model checking routine (possibly on an infinite state space) to slightly generalize a theorem, then in many cases that means I never really had a useful proof of it in the first place.<p>Also, Coq&#x27;s mathematics library is extensive and often closely follows the proofs found in graduate mathematics text books. Last I looked into TLA+, it was squarely focused on algorithms and hardware (not even CS-related mathematics more generally -- specifically algorithms and hardware).<p><i>> So you think some people are more familiar with type theory than with undergrad-level set theory (ZF)?</i><p>Do I think there exists some population of people who are &quot;more familiar&quot; with type theory than with ZF? Yes, starting, for example, with every researcher whose primary area of study is type theory. In fact, I think that anyone who doesn&#x27;t honestly believe there are such people must have an extremely low opinion of quite a number of very smart people.<p>(Also, set theory qua set theory gets really disgusting and kludgey really quickly, and is something that almost no undergraduate (or even phd student) is exposed to these days. The &quot;set theory&quot; you see in a discrete math course kind of barely scrapes definitions. I think most people who posit that &quot;set theory&quot; is nice and simple must&#x27;ve never really dove deem into the actual theory of set theory...)<p>(Also, most real math these days quickly abstracts away from germanely set theoretic constructions. Mathematicians don&#x27;t work in ZF. They do not. Most will <i>tell you</i> they do not, if they even know what ZF is. Which a lot won&#x27;t, because their undergrad discrete math course is probably the last time they saw a truly formal derivation. And the mathematicians who do know what ZF is often can&#x27;t regurgitate an axiomatization of ZF. If you tell a mathematician that all of math is just set theory, most will chuckle and wink and say &quot;why, yes, yes it is&quot;, and hopefully you&#x27;re in on the joke...)<p><i>> I don&#x27;t see it...

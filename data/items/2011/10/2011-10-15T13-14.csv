3114823,comment,3114619,3114786,8,0,raganwald,,,"The complaints from Apple developers have been around forever. Waxing nostalgic, I remember threads on the old Mousehole BBS about Apple and its love-hate relationship with developers. The reaction to Apple steamrolling Panic is classic, and there was a major furor over the dashboard and the way it steamrolled third party widget frameworks.<p>I suspect that Jeff is in a Microsoft-centric culture, so he simply doesn't spend as much time talking to Apple developers as he does Microsoft developers, so of course he hears more from them. Likewise, there are way more Windows developers than OS X developers, so you'll always hear more about anything from them.<p>iOS is popular, so there ought to be plenty of developers out there in the long tail. Maybe that's the real problem: Most developers are trying to grab a little tiny piece of the pie with a niche side-project, so they don't have the same perspective as someone who has employees and a big marketing budget sunk into their business.<p>If this supposition is correct, you'll see the same dynamic with other walled gardens from Microsoft and Google and whomever else gets into the ""curated app store"" business.",1318686990

I think it shows again that, not unlike the first PCs and their open slots for third-party cards, openness is the right move.<p>Many people here seem to renounce to this, mostly because Apple's walled garden is currently at a pinnacle, but in my opinion it is an accident. Apple's products manage to grasp most of the attention around for emotional reasons, and some forget that the future is not built on closed formats, closed markets, etc. I am surprised that it is not so obvious, especially for US citizens. The Web builds on open protocols. The PC-era built on the fact that you could open the box and plug things of your doing in it. Wikipedia, which everyone uses constantly and forget, is an open community task.<p>My two years-old kid is learning a lot, but it is not linear, he sometimes go backward a bit. I think we are in this backward pulse, with everyone suddenly dissmissing the possibility to open, change, modify softwares, in exchange of a (temporary) slightly better user experience.<p>To the Apple lover crowd: please feel free to downvote, and check my past comments to downvotes them also if you didn't already. I'm used to it now, I don't care about my karma. Anyway, I'll loose some more re-upvoting all those perfectly acceptable comments I find grayed in some threads, apparently because they are not respectful enough to the King.<p>Oh, and I like Apple, I learnt computing on an Apple ][, I applauded to the very smart Unix move for MacOS, many of my colleagues and friend own a MPB or A, but none would be enough of a zealots to try to hide out comments expressing concerns about walled gardens.",1318686618

I've been through a few similar hardships and at 24 I already feel like I'm 40 with the amount of responsibilities on my shoulders.<p>My own father passed away at 20 and left me with a 3 bedroom house and an ill mother and almost zero cash. I've had to fight bailiffs from taking this house, stopping the state sending me to jail for paying state taxes late (tip: pay on time, the stress is not worth it)<p>Also graduating into the recession wasn't great and even the current job I'm doing (working at a hot internet company directly with the founders) sees me earning well below my true market value.<p>However, its not all doom and gloom. The OP has alot of time to recover. Here are my own suggestions:<p>1) Exercise: 20 minutes a day do this for 2-3 weeks your mood will lift completely<p>2) Do some sort of work: it doesn't matter<p>3) Date, approach girls, meet new people: if you can do this actively, it will really take your mind of things<p>4) Avoid: anyone who brings you down, this may be difficult at first but find a way around this.  Bring people closer who make you happy and push those away who bring you down. Your family is not exempt here and if the relationship is toxic you need to keep it away from you<p>5) Remember and reflect that you are only 20. Some of the most jammy gits on HN or founders who get an exit in early 20s are lucky, jammy gits. I've read enough into the story to realize they are not all brilliant and these things happen as a matter of coincidence and good fortune. However, think about what you could learn. How did they get into that position, what was their situation, try reach out to them. Last week at work I did a v.comprehensive competitor analysis of everyone in my space and my boss said I need to know what everyone else is doing here so we can learn. And he's been in the game for 10 year.<p>I hope this helps, the HN community have given some formidable advice on this thread!",1318684984

Okay, I say. I tell him getting stuck is the commonest trouble of all. Usually, I say, your mind gets stuck when youre trying to do too many things at once. What you have to do is try not to force words to come. That just gets you more stuck. What you have to do now is separate out the things and do them one at a time. Youre trying to think of what to say and what to say first at the same time and thats too hard. So separate them out. Just make a list of all the things you want to say in any old order. Then later well figure out the right order.

On top of this, every other setback during the period that I'm stuck is magnified.

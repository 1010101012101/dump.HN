Looking for someone who could code all of the frontend + backend (preferably in PHP) If you are interested in getting involved on coding the algorithm I would teach you everything I know. <p>I have been a co-founder in a Ycombinator funded startup in the past. <p>Thanks.<p>My email is bkmrkr at yahoo.com\n",1194627075

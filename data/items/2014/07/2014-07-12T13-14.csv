8024551,comment,8023624,8023809,4,0,psykotic,,,"Fabian isn&#x27;t a Valve engineer. He&#x27;s an engineer at RAD who was contracted out to Valve. His beliefs are utterly sincere. He once threatened to quit RAD on the spot when he found out the main sales guy had gone to a predominantly military-oriented simulation conference. If you accept his sincerity as a premise, your suggestion is akin to saying that someone should continue working on an engineering project with inevitable and uniquely terrible military applications because they are in on the ground floor and should be able to influence future directions. Has that ever worked?<p>I share some of his concerns but not all his conclusions. Where I agree with him unanimously is in being extremely concerned about amoral engineers who are blithely pro-technology. The only thing scarier to me than an amoral engineer is an evangelical engineer for whom technological progress is not morally neutral but morally good.",1405173526
8024550,comment,8023423,8024015,1,0,bane,,,"Right, but they weren&#x27;t just fighting over slavery for no particular reason or because they were mean people who wanted to keep being mean. Slavery was the foundational economic engine of the South. The Confederacy knew that ending slavery would have decimated their economy, which it did and it&#x27;s never really recovered from. It&#x27;s easily to vilify the reprehensible slavery of the South, but &quot;slavery&quot; is a gross oversimplification of the complex issues of the time.<p>The issue was almost entirely economic, and the Southern states couldn&#x27;t get enough representation in Congress to push through favorable legislation that would have protected them, while Northern states enjoyed considerable industrial protectionism for their economies. Even then, the economics of the situation often made it cheaper to import goods and agricultural products from the better developed European economies than to make and grow things domestically. Without favorable import tariffs, the South had to offset the price differential of European imports. Setting tariffs at the state level would have had no effect since the market competition was in other states.<p>There&#x27;s tons of other issues, and a read through of the CSA Constitution can be a really enlightening experience to fully understand the pressures that lead to the civil war.<p>Among the mistakes the South made, they underestimated the advance of industrialization and the economics of mechanization. If the South had invested in these modernities instead of fighting them, they could have had mechanized agriculture and wouldn&#x27;t have needed zero-cost labor to do the work.<p>Another bit of historic timing, the West was opening up and in just a few decades, highly mechanized farming moved profitable agribusiness to there leaving the South without even their own principle economic activity. Being more compliant, the West was also able to better negotiate farming subsidies, a topic still highly controversial today.<p><a href=""http://www.jjmccullough.com/CSA.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jjmccullough.com/CSA.htm</a>",1405173425

8024540,comment,8023814,8023814,4,0,illumen,,,"Quite an interesting series of articles :)<p>The Unix.waitpid failing because the author ported the python code, and did not realise that the python version did something nice which avoided one of the types of bugs.<p>Quite a number of the bugs appear to be because of things that the python code did nicely without the author realising it.<p>This shows how the comparison between a second system, and the first system is not really fair.  This is because much of the code is already tested in the first system.  It also seems to suggest that prototyping in a language like python as a first system is a great way to improve the quality of the second system.  Finish it first quickly, and then improve the quality.<p>It also shows the danger of not using the protective parts of the first system in the second system.  For example, the advanced integers in python avoided some bugs for the author, which manifested in the second system.  The python integers automatically handle overflow, whereas the OCaml ones are 31bit on 32bit systems.<p>OCaml uses non-deterministic garbage collection, whereas python mostly uses reference counting (in CPython).  This is another case where the first system was safer in one aspect.<p>Perhaps OCaml could consider taking on some of these features from python to improve safety.<p>Glue code when libraries are wrapped is another area where these bugs seem to happen.  Some of the GTK bugs, and system call bugs are ones caused by badly wrapped functions.  With more stable and well tested wrapped code, the smaller the likelihood of bugs there will be.  Whilst automating wrapper generation might stop some bugs, I am not convinced, after having used buggy automatically generated wrappers many times where the manually written ones are far superior.<p>The post also proves that a number of bugs were not caught by testing or static type checking.  This makes me wonder if the author has 100% unit test coverage or not?  Some of the bugs should have been caught by unit testing, and others could only have been caught by functional testing.  Some of the platform bugs could have been caught with continuous integration testing on those platforms.",1405173250

8024530,comment,8023821,8023821,1,0,dangrossman,,,"For making the actual charges, a merchant account from an ISO, currently Vantage Card [1]. I pay interchange plus (0.04% + $0.10) per transaction. That&#x27;s the fee charged by Visa/MasterCard to the processor, plus four hundredths of a percent and a dime. For about a quarter of my volume which are debit/check cards used as credit, that&#x27;s just 0.09% + $0.31. For the rest, it probably averages around 1.6-2%, far less than the 2.9% flat rate you&#x27;ll get offered by flashy payment startups.<p>I use Authorize.net as a payment gateway for that account [2]. If you do look at merchant account providers, they&#x27;ll typically set you up with a gateway, you don&#x27;t need to choose and sign up for one yourself. Just watch that they don&#x27;t use it as a way to add on more than nominal fees.<p>To actually hook everything up to my websites, I use Spreedly [3]. They&#x27;re the best thing to happen to payments in years. Spreedly is a single API for 66 different gateways and payment providers, meaning you code against Spreedly and can switch payment companies any time you want without changing any code. They&#x27;re also a PCI Level 1 Certified card vault for storing payment information to charge again in the future, for e.g. running a SaaS business.<p>They offer a pass-thru option where you point the payment form on your website to their URL, and they return the visitor to your page with a token attached that you can then use via their API to make charges, meaning no cardholder data ever touches your servers. That means no on-site PCI audits or any of the other nasty stuff required if you store cards yourself.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.vantagecard.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vantagecard.com/</a><p>2: <a href=""http://www.authorize.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.authorize.net/</a><p>3: <a href=""https://spreedly.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://spreedly.com/</a>",1405173051

In your mind the issue is about domestic violence.<p>It&#x27;s not an either-or situation. The Civil War was about some states having the right to do things that other states found immoral. In that way, if it hadn&#x27;t been slavery, it&#x27;d been something else. States&#x27; rights was the principle, but the fuel that the fire burned was slavery.<p>I&#x27;m happy that it ended the way it did, but I see no need to demonize the south or glorify the north. Slavery was unfinished business from the founding that caused hard feelings for decades. Both sides were eager for a fight to finish it, and that&#x27;s what they got.<p>Once you move beyond the moral issue, it&#x27;s pretty obvious that what was going on was that a rural, agrarian, spread-out country was becoming a centralized industrial one.

I would hope that anyone who&#x27;s played and enjoyed 1024, 2048 or the myriad knock-offs would at least go and buy a copy of the app. It&#x27;s a great little game and totally worth $2 (indeed, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s on par with the quality and playability of the early Nintendo &quot;Game Watch&quot; devices, and that&#x27;s very high praise BTW.  IIRC they retailed for around $25 in the 80&#x27;s, so Threes is actually underpriced.)<p>Threes invented a wonderful game mechanic, and I&#x27;m reminded of the amazing indie games particularly on Kongregate. It&#x27;s really something special to see all the creativity and joy that a great computer game can create.<p>My advice to the Threes inventors would be: rise above the imitators. Indeed, see them for what they are, gestures of respect (with the exception of 1024, who&#x27;s makers are just assholes).

If the site went down for even a half hour, that could be tens of thousands of dollars in missed donations. That is like someone not getting paid for almost a year.<p>We had a cool autocomplete feature that went out and due to a bug that made it past QA caused a on of DB queries and took down the server. It was maybe a better user experience, but the way it was implemented would cost too much in reliability for it to be worth it.

In a tolerant regime, such people may learn to tolerate, or at least to behave &quot;as if they possessed this virtue&quot;. Philosopher Karl Popper asserted, in The Open Society and Its Enemies Vol. 1, that we are warranted in refusing to tolerate intolerance. Philosopher John Rawls concludes in A Theory of Justice that a just society must tolerate the intolerant, for otherwise, the society would then itself be intolerant, and thus unjust. However, Rawls also insists, like Popper, that society has a reasonable right of self-preservation that supersedes the principle of tolerance: &quot;While an intolerant sect does not itself have title to complain of intolerance, its freedom should be restricted only when the tolerant sincerely and with reason believe that their own security and that of the institutions of liberty are in danger.&quot;",1395977791

A lot of beautiful designs done by talented designers end up being worse than what was before. They might be prettier, but they are very likely worse by many conversion metrics.<p>Don&#x27;t think of it in terms of pure design. Think of it in terms of cost. Everything has a cost and sometimes good design&#x27;s real cost is in user behavior. Pageviews and time on site could go down because people aren&#x27;t going through so many steps to get to what they want. There are a lot of metrics that aren&#x27;t that useful without the context of the ultimate conversion numbers for your site/app/product/project.<p>Facebook and Google are advertising companies. The financial metric they care about is advertising revenue per user and number of users. It&#x27;s not much different than a SAAS app in that way. Other metrics are important, but that is the metric that pays the bills.<p>A beautiful design that doesn&#x27;t improve the core metrics is like a multi million dollar super bowl commercial that flops. Sure, it might be really cool and well produced, but if it doesn&#x27;t sell your product, you might as well light that money on fire. The net effect is the same.",1395975717

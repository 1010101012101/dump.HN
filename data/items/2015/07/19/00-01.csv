It recognizes the fact that work can get done without coercion.<p>Bad leaders will lean on the authority of being a boss and be coercive. When you have no bosses or you have temporary leaders/bosses who don&#x27;t have authority there is no choice but to <i>convince</i> your peers that the thing you&#x27;re working on is worthwhile.<p>&quot;We don&#x27;t like bosses&quot; is only teenage angst if there&#x27;s no alternative provided or explored.<p>><i>Not really sure why anyone would think democracy was a good way to run a company</i><p>George Orwell described the difference in the fascist and anarchist armies in Spain, where the anarchist groups had to convince their peers to do something. Yes it took a little longer to say &quot;we should attack/defend X because Y and Z, and <insert answers to more questions about the plan here>&quot; than to say &quot;we are attacking/defending X right now or you will be shot&quot;. But each person who signed up to the plan were convinced that it was a good idea, they were more dedicated.<p>So yeah, you&#x27;re right, lots of people in a company aren&#x27;t good at leading. So either we help them get better or we reduce the power of bosses so that if a bad leader becomes in charge we all don&#x27;t have to suffer (democracies are stronger than monarchies and dictatorships, pretty good reason to explore how democracy can benefit a workplace).",1437267279

In reality, these are unrealistically small numbers. Each employee will have a cost to the corporation of $125,000-150,000 a year. Employees of that caliber spending 10% of their time on supervising a cluster for a year is $75,000-90,000. I&#x27;m amortizing the amount of work over your 3 datacenters by imagining you already have the staff and only counting out the number of hours needed for just this work.<p>So the reality is that you left off something like $225,000-270,000 in actual cost of running your own cluster from your analysis, because while it&#x27;s not &quot;much different&quot;, it is a few hours a week from at least 6 employees if you&#x27;re really talking about running managed, highly reliable storage.",1437267223

9909577,comment,9908909,9908909,0,0,jrapdx3,,,"The sound of rain is very familiar to us living west of the Cascades in the Pacific Northwest.  When it rains more days than not in a given season, for many locals the sound of rain is often not exactly &quot;soothing&quot;.<p>As a qualified &quot;rain sound critic&quot;, to my ears the generated rainfall didn&#x27;t sound convincingly natural.  Real rain is somewhat less &quot;white&quot; (lets call it &quot;gray&quot;), with a steadier, if muffled &quot;thud&quot; as drops hit land.<p>Of course there are many variables, like wind speed, rate of rain accumulation, soil conditions, urban vs. rural location among others, that alter rain&#x27;s sound qualities.  Accounting for these factors would probably be quite difficult.  Too bad the website didn&#x27;t provide more info about the sound generation algorithms, I think HN readers would appreciate that.<p>As far as applications of generated sounds go, I think it&#x27;s a very individual matter.  In respect to tinnitus, a condition I&#x27;ve had for a long time, it&#x27;s not a problem only when things are quiet.<p>In my case the internally generated high-pitched squeal is constant, loud enough to interfere with normal conversation.  Adding external noise doesn&#x27;t decrease or &quot;mask&quot; the tinnitus, just makes it harder to distinguish sounds in the environment.<p>One more thing, having known hundreds of adults with ADHD, mileage varies considerably re: benefit or decrement of background sounds on concentration.  Offhand I don&#x27;t know of studies documenting effects, but it would be an interesting study to conduct.  My guess is most would do better in a quiet, but not too quiet environment.  The issue is precisely what is &quot;quiet&quot; or &quot;too quiet&quot; for these individuals.",1437266671

I completely agree that culture fit and giving candidates a chance to learn about the company/position are hugely important to any interview. I could write entire posts about each of those.<p>I guess I should have been clearer in my description that I was writing strictly about the <i>technical</i> portion of an interview.<p>That said, my experience has been that it&#x27;s much more difficult to effectively evaluate a candidate&#x27;s technical ability based on take-home tests or the like. A phone screen would probably work well too, but since that requires a fair amount of my time, I usually prefer to just meet in person.<p>Hiring is such an important part of any company, and even more so at a super early-stage startup like the one I work at. So I always try to err on the side of false positives instead of false negatives. I&#x27;d rather invite more candidates to interview and maybe have some of them end up being under-qualified than to miss out on a great candidate because I&#x27;m making too many assumptions before meeting them.<p>That said, this stuff isn&#x27;t an exact science, and I&#x27;m certainly not claiming to have discovered the One True Way™.

9909498,comment,9908755,9909444,0,0,DanAndersen,,,"I agree with you on the importance of rhetoric -- in the sense of really breaking down what people are saying. Though, I remember being taught some of that in school and I don&#x27;t know if it stuck for most students. It&#x27;s probably a disconnect between a subject learned for school and tests, and a subject that&#x27;s really internalized. A lot of analyzing dusty old essays and historical arguments, not enough forceful application to one&#x27;s own modern-day surroundings.<p>(And I think you&#x27;re probably correct about the crossbow bit. The influence it had was in the manner of making arms more accessible -- hand a peasant a crossbow and all that. I suppose a different analogy would be World War 1 -- outdated charging tactics coming up against machine guns, though that&#x27;s a case where defense had the upper hand over offense.)",1437264442

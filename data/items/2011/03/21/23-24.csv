2352176,comment,2348227,2348227,0,0,malmros,,,"There are three forms of communication (typically): verbal, written, and gestural.  Verbal is either face to face - and often is heavily laced with gestural - or via telephone.  And of course written in all its wondrous forms. Also the most ""difficult"" of the three. (Pardon... if I seem to be generalizing...) If you think about it, social networking is like a ""holiday note"" stuck in the card... sent to everyone on the list - but continually.  You could do the same with email and then you would retain some ownership of your content.  And Twitter is everyone's text messages - which would be spam if you got in your inbox.  But it certainly is entertaining for some reason.  I tried using Twitter as an RSS feed... eh!  Actually, everyone has an email that uses a ""social network""... so why not just use email?  Email is peer-to-peer ... and creative developers could easily come up with a Facebook like email GUI. So you parse all your friends emails into a nice timeline and profile page... and when you update, you would send out a ""group"" email to your network - or select subset... and they would get it parsed out in their GUI.  That's really all FB is... or Linkedin. What's the first thing they want to do when you sign up?  Get your email contact list!  So in essence, we give them our contacts and content so they can tell us what we can and cannot do with it (TOS) and then inundate us with more spam.  What am I missing here?",1300750662

(And no business experience, either! My major is creative writing.) At first I did the natural thing for a ""non-technical co-founder"": I asked every programmer I could find if they wanted to build the product for me in exchange for equity in my unfunded company. Needless to say, this did not work out.<p>I decided to teach myself how to do it, which meant starting from the very beginning. I bought a ""For Dummies"" book on HTML, CSS and JavaScript (Yes, it was really that bad! Back when I took a web design course in high school, they were still teaching us to format with tables.) and worked my way up to more serious books on MySQL, PHP, and jQuery, all the while working on my website. I now have a beta version of the site online, and I'm testing it with friends and family. I've also learned enough about programming to get a part-time job as a developer at another company. (Not the highest-paying developer job, but still! Real US currency, and the beta version of my website was my only resume.) There are still tons of things that I want to add to my website that I don't know how to build yet, and many aspects of the design that I'm not happy with, but that's okay! Only three months ago I didn't even know CSS! At least now I have a working demo that I can show to potential team members, investors, and future clients.<p>If you're already programming as a hobby, you'll probably love programming as a job, and you're a lot further along than I was when I started. The only way to build a web app is to build it. And I promise you that until you start building it you have not even <i>begun</i> to conceptualize it!

2352091,comment,2348381,2348974,0,0,Peaker,,,"I think saying that FP is bad for ""manipulating state"" is misleading.<p>FP is great at manipulating state. A pure Haskell function (State -> State) manipulates state.<p>What's being discussed is whether or not the state is manipulated <i>destructively</i>.  And personally I don't see any real benefits to the destructive method, except performance issues in some cases, and arguably stylistic ones.<p>Returning new values instead of in-place updates may seem cumbersome before you get to know the abstractions that make it easy to use.<p>As an example, in Haskell, if you want to update a value deep inside multiple nested records, you do something like:<p><pre><code>    movePlayer :: (Pos -> Pos) -> GameState -> GameState\n    movePlayer f gs = gs { player = oldPlayer { position = f oldPos } }\n      where\n        oldPlayer = player gs\n        oldPos = position oldPlayer\n</code></pre>\nThat looks horrible, compared to something like:<p><pre><code>    gs.player.position = f(gs.player.position);\n</code></pre>\nBut then, if you discover the Semantic Editor Combinators abstraction (<a href=""http://conal.net/blog/posts/semantic-editor-combinators/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conal.net/blog/posts/semantic-editor-combinators/</a>), then you can write that as:<p><pre><code>    movePlayer :: (Pos -> Pos) -> GameState -> GameState\n    movePlayer f = (atPlayer . atPosition) f\n</code></pre>\nor just:<p><pre><code>    movePlayer = atPlayer . atPosition\n</code></pre>\nThen you can use:<p><pre><code>    movePlayer (+delta)\n\n</code></pre>\nto add delta to the position.<p>Now one nice thing about the return-new-value approach is that it is more composable than the destructive update approach.  When you compose state manipulation functions, you get <i>transactional</i> state changes.<p>So paradoxically, I believe functional languages to be <i>better</i> at manipulating state!",1300749457

You need enough RAM to keep this in memory at all times. Otherwise for every write you'll have to scan through the entire table on disk, find matching blocks, then modify it.

Under relevant trademark law, a mark cannot be registered if it consists solely of a generic or purely descriptive term. ""Store"" is generic. So too is the word ""application"" - which is commonly thought of as being what the word ""app"" refers to. Therefore, no trademark could ever be registered for the word ""store"" or for the word ""application"" and certainly not for ""application store"" (no trademark can be registered when <i>all</i> of its constituent elements are generic). A trademark identifies the <i>origin</i> of goods or services and no one vendor can claim that a whole generic category of goods or services can be set out as a domain for which it and it alone is the origin. The question is, does any of this change because Apple's claim is for the word ""app"" as opposed to ""application.""<p>Apple claims that ""app"" in this context is a word that refers uniquely to Apple in the public mind - that is, when a typical consumer hears of an ""app,"" that person immediately associates that word with ""Apple app"" and not with the generic term ""application."" In legal parlance, then, Apple is arguing that the word ""app"" here has an ""arbitrary"" meaning and is therefore registrable to Apple alone. If Apple prevails on this claim, it will be able to sue anyone in the future who tries to sell ""apps"" through any form of ""app store.""<p>Of course, many other vendors are using the ""app"" designation for selling online applications and there is thus vigorous opposition to Apple's application. Indeed, once the trademark examiner granted the application, Amazon immediately filed a proceeding contesting it. To date, then, Apple does not have any definitive determination in its favor on this issue. By continuing to push the trademark application, and by filing this lawsuit, Apple <i>hopes</i> to pave the way to have exclusive use going forward of ""App Store"" as against all competitors.<p>I think Apple is overstepping it on this one. If it should be granted what it seeks, how will other vendors be able to refer even generically to what they are offering? Trademark law is intended to protect a company's distinct offerings and to prevent others from pawning off a vendor's good will by passing their goods or services off as that of their real owner. I doubt that anyboday will believe that what Amazon or Google or any of a number of other vendors offer is an attempt to trade on Apple's goodwill. On the other hand, trademark law is <i>not</i> intended to give anybody any form of exclusivity in describing generic categories of goods or services. That appears to be precisely what Apple is here attempting to do.<p>Apple has one more obstacle to overcome as well. A term that is at some point a distinctive identifier of a vendor's goods or services can <i>become</i> generic over time (consider ""yo-yo,""aspirin,"" ""escalator,"" and many others that have suffered this fate). If ""app"" was at one time distinctive to Apple a few years back, I seriously doubt that the public today thinks of it as anything other than a generic indicator of what you can download from a wide variety of sources.",1300748936

What we're looking for:<p>- A technical, third co-founder to apply with us to Imagine K12.<p>We're open to technologies, but I'm intrigued by what I've been reading regarding the Lithium framework for PHP, as well as MongoDB.<p>Beyond developing our tech. I would love someone who would be willing to help me learn the coding ropes so that I can help with some small tasks down the road.  I have a 30K foot understanding of software, but can't write a line of code.  I'm a business guy who wants to learn the tech. and I need help.<p>2. What we bring to the table:<p>- I have sold over $1.5M in B2B custom software in two years with a small company, graduated from a top ranked college entrepreneurship program, launched a start-up (failed) and currently work as a project manager for a tech company.<p>My partner is a 3rd year law student who hustles and is an expert on our target market (it's not schools).<p>If we get in, we'd form an equal 3 way partnership.  While finding the right developer can be a critical success factor, so is having the right team to market it.  I believe we have 2/3 of the equation.<p>3. The idea:<p>- A Web based application that is free to the schools, but provides a valuable resource to our customers when the schools use it.<p>As it has been noted before, there is nothing at this stage to keep anyone from stealing an idea, hence the vagueness.  Entrepreneurship is about calculated risk, and at this point it doesn't seem wise to describe the concept in further detail.  Besides, the team is more important than the idea, right?<p>4. Where we're at right now:<p>- After a year of trying to fake it before we made it and sell school districts on the concept, we experienced firsthand what PG said when introducing the Imagine K12 program:<p>""Public schools tend to be the last to benefit from the sort of innovation startups generate, because they are so hard to sell to. Selling technology to school districts is like selling it to big companies, but more so. Which means startups hoping to build things for schools have trouble even getting off the ground.""<p>That was over a year ago now that we had a considerable amount of difficulty ""getting off the ground.""  Since it sounds like Imagine K12 aims to solve the problem of getting into schools, our next biggest hurdle is development.<p>5. Summation:<p>- A 2 person team with sales, legal, start-up, PM and customer experience is seeking a developer to be our 3rd, equal partner in applying to the Imagine K12 program (Deadline = May 1, 2011).<p>If we get accepted, we will commit to leaving our current vocations and working on the start-up full time.<p>I hope that was brief, but thorough.<p>Feel free to ask any questions.<p>If you're interested, please shoot me an email.<p>(Please try to be constructive in your criticism of this post. I learn a lot from HN and I it continues.)",1300748434

I understand the issue of radiation and electronics not working well but it seems like throwing an HD web cam up there would help guide folks. Something that will no doubt be discussed would be better telemetry during events like this. I'm sure secondary systems were in place but it surprised me that without power to the reactor buildings all of the sensor networks were essentially down[2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/11032105-e.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/11032105-e....</a><p>[2] One of the news articles on the restoration of power to reactors 1 and 2 reports that this will allow them to read the reactor's sensors again.",1300748431

IT&#x27;s a completely separate observation. With all due respect, you don&#x27;t get to decide what my argument is.<p><i>It&#x27;s also a bit odd, because once again, voter ID plays a negligible part in it. If I, owenmarshall, was born in Notamericastan and am not a citizen, yet I register and vote in an election, the act of me actually voting is sufficient proof that I, a citizen of Notamericastan, committed voter fraud.</i><p>No it isn&#x27;t. If challenged about this, in many states where the registration requirements are quite loose you could reasonably say &#x27;some other person registered to vote using my name,&#x27; and it&#x27;s difficult to prove otherwise. As you can see, registration requirements aren&#x27;t consisitent from state to state and it&#x27;s questionable how good of a job states do at verifying the citizenship status of registrants: <a href=""http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/Documents/Federal%20Voter%20Registration_6-25-14_ENG.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/Documents/Federal%20Voter%20Regi...</a><p><i>How does requiring an ID provide any additional proof that the person voted? The fact that I signed my name and received a ballot is prima facie sufficient to demonstrate that.</i><p>Depends on how distinctive your signature is.<p><i>It&#x27;s also important to note this isn&#x27;t the case: the conventional wisdom has always been that the known instances of illegal voting which could be reasonably addressed through voter ID requirements were in the mere dozens, negligible compared to the much larger body of legal voters who risk disenfranchisement.</i><p>That&#x27;s not true. You&#x27;re rewriting the historical argument in order to avoid addressing new information. The conventional wisdom has been that known instances were in the mere dozens. Adding &#x27;which could reasonably be addressed through voter ID requirements&#x27; is a misrepresentation of the anti-voter-ID position.<p><i>So we agree that photo ID requirements are useless, right? ;-)</i><p>No we don&#x27;t, and I don&#x27;t find your rhetorical contortions funny. While I don&#x27;t think photo ID requirements are a remedy for the problem of illegal voting (for the reasons laid out in the article, with the primary problem being that many illegal voters aren&#x27;t aware they&#x27;re breaking the law and may even think they&#x27;re doing the wright thing, the reason I&#x27;m arguing for consideration of voter ID is that it addresses the obviates the argument of people who argue that the electoral process is deliberately corrupted.<p>I&#x27;m getting tired explaining this so I&#x27;m going to stop now. As I said earlier, Democrats would save themselves an awful lot of political capital if they stopped trying to rationalize the abundant flaws of the electoral registration system and instead focused their efforts on ensuring that disadvantaged citizens who lack valid photo ID were provided with it, which would bring disenfranchised people many significant benefits beyond that of exercising their electoral franchise.",1414483171

Parsing Protobufs in Python is really horrible performance-wise since you have to inspect and branch on almost every byte. The way to make Python fast is to delegate as much work as possible to the built-in libraries that are written in C. But, there&#x27;s just nothing that can be delegated in the case of Protobufs. In contrast, a Cap&#x27;n Proto parser could pretty easily leverage the existing `struct` module.<p>That said, if you enable Cap&#x27;n Proto&#x27;s &quot;packed&quot; mode, then this advantage is lost, since that&#x27;s another byte-by-byte algorithm that will perform poorly in pure Python.",1414483038

8519887,comment,8515120,8518542,0,0,ivanr,,,"I built a similar single-source publishing workflow to publish my books, but it&#x27;s based around DocBook. I am very happy with DocBook because it has all the features I need for technical publishing (styling, indexing, cross-references, etc). For writing I use OxygenXML, which allows me to edit text without working with XML directly and -- crucially -- supports change tracking that makes working with editors/copyeditors a breeze.<p>To get good results from FOP you really need to dig deep into the XSL stylesheets. The amount of customisation work is usually not that big, but the problem is that you need to learn a lot about the stylesheets to know how to make the changes. If you don&#x27;t already know XSLT the learning curve can be steep. The change-build-test process is very slow, especially when you&#x27;re essentially guessing where to make the changes. (Which, for me, happened most of the time.)<p>I was happy with FOP, but eventually moved to a commercial product: 1) I wanted to use OpenType fonts, which generally offer better quality and support a wide range of languages, 2) full support for ligatures, 3) better handling of SVG illustrations (FOP&#x27;s integration with Batik is clunky and makes it very difficult to use the same fonts as the main document), and 4) better indexes.",1414482006

Project management is best outsourced to Trello, in my experience. I&#x27;m a fanatic of both.<p>For non-personal data, I&#x27;ve forced my wife to keep pictures of purses and whatever on Pinterest rather than on her local HDD (where she would never view them again). Likewise, articles I want to read are best saved to Pocket, where viewing, archiving, and deleting are dead simple. And of course, Kindle is a great place to buy and sync commercial ebooks.<p>My whole life is moving online, and I fully expect everything I have will be stored and presented through online services in five years or less.",1414480550

But let&#x27;s face it,who doesn&#x27;t?). MyBizziBlog is a very powerful platform when utilized correctly. It has alot of creative,but yet,powerful features that extend into the realm of modern blogging solutions,plus more. One can collaborate on multiple blogs ,and publish with others, and can also invite others and manage their own blogs. Blog owners can even setup revenue-sharing for their blogs so that their contributors,and themselves, can enjoy additional revenue to their content. Blog owners can even raise &quot;Blog Funding&quot; from the Marketplace by selling virtual shares called &quot;Studio Shares&quot; and receive real money for their blogs,which can be used to pay their contributors.

It&#x27;s a new site that launched in June 2014 and it&#x27;s already growing fast. It&#x27;s completely free so it&#x27;s worth a try. I think it will be a big player in the social blogging world soon. Comment your thoughts below.",1414480123

It&#x27;s in fact quite difficult to map words to their intentions and get it right consistently (especially within a proper context). So difficult that people set up Kaggle competitions on exactly this. I actually got my &quot;magical&quot; training data from a competition that paid out $10k, which I explained in the article but here it is again:<p><a href=""https://www.kaggle.com/c/detecting-insults-in-social-commentary/data"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kaggle.com/c/detecting-insults-in-social-comment...</a><p>They did a great job building a baseline training data set to evaluate several different models on. Which are all briefly explained or at least shown in code in the article. And what &quot;hate&quot; actually means here is the probability that a comment is considered insulting. The &quot;hater score&quot; is just an average of the most recent (or oldest, depending on your settings) comments&#x27; probabilities that they are insulting.<p>3. I read and looked at several different attempts to build something similar by various data scientists who were kind enough to share their findings, including a huge contributor to scikit-learn (<a href=""https://github.com/amueller"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/amueller</a>).<p>4. Taking out quoted text would be a great feature to add. I have about 5 or 6 new features I will probably add and see if the model works any better for it, thanks for the suggestion (another person was suggesting the same thing). :)<p>5. This was just to see how well &quot;sprinkled algorithms&quot; and magical coding works in the wild world of actual comments. I love learning and improving my knowledge base with actual experience so I figured why not build something and see what happens. :)",1414479858

Sometimes you need to add things to the cart, several things, then review them before the final checkout. Also, from a merchant standpoint, I&#x27;d rather have a single order with multiple line items instead of multiple orders of single line items for the same person. Sure, we can try to guess the user&#x27;s intention and attempt to concatenate orders together to save both the customer and ourselves on shipping as well as warehouse labor, but this becomes a significant burden (of which would get passed to the customer in the form of increased costs).<p>Add items to cart --> review cart for proper quantities and everything you want --> checkout.

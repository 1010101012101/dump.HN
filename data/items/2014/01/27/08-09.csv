7129440,comment,7127821,7129372,3,0,ygra,,,"Includes predate C++ by a bit. And there is nothing that specifically forbids such a thing; it&#x27;s just the preprocessor literally inserting (and interpreting) the file specified.<p>Now, normally there are include guards (or #pragma once) to guard against including the same header file twice. But of course that&#x27;s only necessary because the language specification doesn&#x27;t say that including the same file twice is disallowed.<p>One can surely construct something where including the same file twice <i>does</i> make sense, e.g. in the light of new #defines in between the two inclusions:<p><pre><code>    // foo.h\n    #ifdef FOO\n      ...\n    #else\n      ...\n    #endif\n\n    // foo.c\n    #include &quot;foo.h&quot;\n    #define FOO\n    #include &quot;foo.h&quot;\n</code></pre>\nMind you, this is probably not a good idea, at all. But some people might build such things. A similar method that springs to mind is Android&#x27;s native build system ndk-build, which is a thickly-veiled GNU make where you basically include targets that do something with a lot of variables you set beforehand. And you can do so multiple times in a row. Maybe the included file uses a defined symbol to emit some generated code based on that symbol and you might want to do that with several symbols. Macros are usually preferred for that, but nothing stops you from using an included file.",1390812947

7129432,comment,7128284,7128284,7,0,ergoproxy,,,"Quite simply, &quot;productivity&quot; is the sum of all real goods and services produced in the economy, while &quot;wages&quot; are simply the share of that produce brought home by the workers who produce it. The difference is profit. If productivity increases (as it has since the 1950s) and wages flatline (as they have since the 1970s), then the result must be rising profits. You can see this graphed in the brief &quot;The wedges between productivity and median compensation growth&quot; at <a href=""http://www.epi.org/publication/ib330-productivity-vs-compensation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epi.org/publication/ib330-productivity-vs-compens...</a><p>The question left unanswered in this article is why are wages in the US falling relative to productivity?<p>Since wages are the &quot;price&quot; of labor, and prices are set by supply-and-demand, falling wages imply either (1) an increasing labor supply or (2) a shrinking demand for labor (or both). So here are some specific reasons for stagnating US wages:<p>INCREASING LABOR SUPPLY\n - Slave labor, prison labor and child labor in countries like China.\n - Immigration from Latin America after NAFTA.\n - Liberated women entering the paid US labor force starting in the 70s.<p>DECREASING DEMAND FOR LABOR\n - New labor-saving technology, computers and robots that work faster, better and cheaper than humans.\n - Financialization: Investors can make more money from asset bubbles in housing, bonds, and dollars than they can from labor.\n -- ZIRP: With real interest rates heading to zero (or less), why should I continue to pay high interest on the money I borrowed a decade ago to build this US factory? Liquidate the factory, fire the workers, and relocate somewhere cheaper; or better: simply use the money to buy bonds and bet on falling interest rates.\n -- High housing prices: An employer needs to pay his workers subsistence wages, which means enough to buy a place to live, but with housing prices so high, this is impossible. Better to bet on the housing bubble than buy labor.",1390812674

If you want to spend time out of the workforce you can reduce your consumption of goods and services.

If a significant number of Danes prefer consumption to leisure then they are harmed by parental leave. They are forced to trade consumption for leisure even though they don&#x27;t want to.

7129415,comment,7126153,7126440,2,0,kerkeslager,,,"This is basically a classic confidence trick, using people&#x27;s greed and overconfidence. The con artist leads the marks to believe that they can outsmart the market, when in fact the marks are the ones being outsmarted.<p>Ultimately, there are two kinds of people that these con artists make money off of, and both have this overconfidence that they can outsmart the market:<p>1. Collaborators: these are the people who think that they are in on Fontas or Wolong&#x27;s plan, but aren&#x27;t. Ultimately, some of these people <i>will</i> make money some of the time, but most will lose money.<p>2. Manic-or-panic day traders: these people fall prey to a these market manipulations because they are at the wrong place at the wrong time. If they&#x27;re paying attention when the market spikes, they start buying high thinking it will rise further, and if they&#x27;re paying attention when the market drops they sell low thinking it will fall further. It may actually be worse to be this kind of trader, because often the only person conning such people is themselves. Their emotional approach to investing causes them to fall prey to <i>every</i> market fluctuation, even ones that aren&#x27;t caused by any manipulation.<p>The kicker here is that I believe <i>most</i> day-traders fall into that second group. A lot of them are still making money on cryptocurrencies simply because cryptocurrencies have been growing so rapidly, leading them to believe that their strategies have worked, but the vast majority would make more by simply investing their money and sitting on it. My theory is backed up by how people tend to invest on wall street, which has been well-researched at this point.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say to anyone reading this is that if you&#x27;re trading day-to-day, unless you have a <i>very</i> thoroughly proven mathematical model, you&#x27;re likely in the second group. Don&#x27;t let overconfidence and greed make you a mark. You aren&#x27;t likely to outsmart the market. Besides, this market is doing pretty well anyway.",1390812347

US <i>effective</i> corporate tax rate has been declining as corporations have found ways to keep profits in offshore tax havens.  This is a huge contributor.<p>See for example this article about AAPL whose effective tax rate is 14% which is much lower than the US nominal corporate tax rate of 35%.<p><a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-23/apple-tax-rate-ignores-profit-shifting-offshore.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-23/apple-tax-rate-igno...</a><p>2. Outsourcing to lower cost centers. This is also contributing to lower US wages;  If a company can move the work to India, Brazil, China, etc. at a much cheaper cost, they will do that.   This has been going on for decades, but  advancements in telecommunications and internet has made outsourcing to far away locations more efficient and cost effective over the past 10-15 years.<p>3. Federal reserve keeping short term rates at 0% and manipulating other fixed income rates with the QE program, e.g. buying $100BLN worth of MBS and US treasuries every month.   This had the effect of creating record-low interest rates for corporate and junk bonds.  This lowers interest costs for companies and also increases business demand because more companies are able to borrow $$ than otherwise.<p>Some of the revenues and profits are increased just because corporate and public debt has increased abnormally.",1390811351

If you wanna look stuff up for discussions, look it up better. BTW they even mirrored the entire world for the wii version so link could be right handed btw (like the worldmap is mirrored even), it&#x27;s pretty neat if you wanna go read about it.<p>gamecube launch was delayed to help sales of wii version for fairly obvious reasons. you&#x27;re telling me things i already know and then concluding, based on a quick (and careless) reading of wikipedia, that you know better. your own link even says stuff like motion to swing sword in wii TP is cuz they ran out of buttons.",1390809656

(Hire cheap gophers to scan papers into a centralized system, your distributed workforce grades them in near-real time, results available in your inbox and online gradebook before the end of the day.)<p>It is crazy that we have folks with e.g. master's degrees in history marking 90 copies of the same ""connect the term with the definition"" homework assignment when it could be done by anybody capable of reading.  (The cost of having a 40 year old teacher with a master's degree mark that homework assignment is, as a ballpark number, about $150.  It could be done by a Midwestern housewife with a master's degree for $20 if you let her work from home, or for $10 if you outsourced it overseas.)<p>That avoids the larger problem of ""Why did we assign that?"", of course.

I know that the design is great and the transition or animation is nice looking. But the main goal of the users is to read the content not to enjoy the beautiful animations. The animations become a hindrance for the readers. It distracts the readers from the content. It slows down the reading. When adding features, don't just be impressed by the technology. It is crucial to think about what is the goal of the users and how this feature can help achieving this goal. Never add a feature because it is fancy or just because you can do it.",1270704698

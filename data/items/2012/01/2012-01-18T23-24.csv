If acquiring and keeping users is a means to an end, namely advertising revenue, then users are secondary to advertising revenue.  Is there some other dynamic in the corporation (other than profit) that drives Facebook and Google to value users?  If the answer is human good will, then I can believe it has some influence in some cases, but not that it ever overrides profit.  Good will can be influential where there is a sincere belief that it is the best guide to long-term profit, and I think Google's founders were fairly successful in instilling that belief in their corporate culture, but in a mass consumer business that belief will be worn down through the process of making many small decisions where the two priorities conflict.",1326931175

The problem is that in the quest to be unequivocally, unquestionably correct, the message ends up getting diluted and ultimately destroyed.<p>The reasons the Republicans control the debate is because they come to a decision on an issue, and focus on getting their message and viewpoint across in the simplest way possible. They do not play devil's advocate, do not focus on arguments against their point, because it's an ineffective use of their time when being listened to. They frame issues in a way that people can understand them, and, in their own perverse way, respect their audience for the fact they often are not very interested in the details and would like someone to sum up their views succinctly and in a way that makes a value judgement possible quickly.<p>Where they cross the line is where they outright lie. But it's not their responsibility to point out the flaws in their own argument, nor is it their responsibility to avoid logical fallacies in making their case if those appeals to emotion make the issue more 'real' for their audience.<p>Meanwhile, Democrats trying to do the right thing end up in-fighting over the most minute detail of how to frame their argument in a way that is both pure and honest. They acknowledge the argument of the other side, and always posit themselves as a refutation to the primary mover, the Republicans (or in this case, the big media industry.) They do not frame the argument. They do not set the grounds for discussion. They do not assert their power.<p>A lot can be learned by watching the way the right-wing spin machine works. It is a tool that can be used for good or evil, and used in a way that is ethically sound. Of course, it is important to avoid the trap of going too far, and we can see clearly the result of doing so. But this doesn't mean that we can't channel the power of messaging, framing, and so on in order to bring about progress.<p>For example, we've already lost this debate in so many ways. The response to this shouldn't just be ""block this bill"" it should be ""block this bill"", and:<p>- Here is a concise message that summarizes our position: ""Don't break our Internet,"" ""Get your hands off our Internet"", ""Leave the Internet alone,"" ""Stop trying to break the Internet"" (Edit: Right now, Google's position is ""Please don't censor the web!"" Say that in the voice of a little girl and you might understand why this messaging sucks. Don't say please. Don't use the word censor. Tell them to fuck off without using profanity.)<p>- Here is a pledge that you as a representative must sign about passing Internet legislation or else you will not receive any votes from this consitutency.<p>- Here is a bill we would like you to pass (pushed by lobbyists from Google/Facebook/etc) that prevents future legislation from tampering with the free flow of information on the Internet.<p>- We now refer to the companies pushing SOPA as the ""Old Media"", ""Content Monopolies"", ""Pre-Internet Media"", ""Legacy Content Providers"", ""Anti-Artist Media"", or ""Copyright Law Abusers"". We refer to sites like Spotify and Youtube as ""Modern Media"", ""Open Media"", ""Pro-Artist Media"", or ""Modern Content Providers.""<p>- ""Copyright infringement"" is not ""piracy"" but is ""missharing."" ""Net Neutrality"" is ""Free Internet"" or ""Web Freedom"". DRM is on ""Chained Content"" or ""Locked Content"". Etc.<p>It's not dishonest.

I stuck with Engineering because I wanted to do it and also, because it was hard; thus supposedly more rewarding in the long term.

I don't have any pirated software at all on my system.<p>But most people aren't ready or capable of learning a whole new operating system they have to install and manage themselves (unless Linux comes preinstalled on the computer). And most importantly, almost everyone uses certain software for which there is no equivalent on other OSes.<p>Now consider a certain user who is completely fed up with the way Microsoft has been (mis)treating their paying customers and doesn't want to support this behaviour with his money anymore. If you're not opposed to piracy ""on principle"", which is fine but ends all discussion before it can even start, then pirating Windows seems like a possible (yet illegal) solution.",1326927849

It is to illuminate the speed at which computing platforms can be displaced.<p><i>The metric that matters is usage, obviously almost everyone has a PC and since most PCs sold in the last 5 years are capable to satisfying users without an upgrade, the fact that PCs are still selling in such a high volume doesn't bode well for the doomsday predictions by number-twisting bloggers.</i><p>PC sales have not been contributing much to the bottom lines of HP, Dell etc for many years now.<p>In business, profit matters. Usage is indirectly useful if it leads to profits. This is the fundamental difference between the Apple and Google worldviews.<p>The tl;dr summary is that computer makers have to sell many more PCs to come close to what Apple is making from the sale of each iPhone or iPad.",1326927713

I didn't have to use windows for a very long time, and about a month ago I installed a windows XP SP3 in a virtual machine. The grace period ended a few days ago:<p><pre><code>  - the automatic activation failed
  - my product key is said to have been pirated
  - the phone support for registration is now fully automated, and just rejects my phone activation.
  - the machine won't load whole subsystems of windows until is activated (you can monkey your way around from the IE instance you can launch from the activation dialog, but your system is not fully functionnal)
  - I am searching for how to get a human to deal with the situation
</code></pre>
I might be failing somewhere and this situation is all due to my lack of experience, but I am with a CD of windows in one hand and a hosed install on the other, and nowhere to go from there.
This is just one of the worse software experience I ever have in a few years.",1326927706

2. Music/video
3. Games
4. Email/sms
5. Phone<p>That's almost the exact opposite of every corporate user, and most teenagers.<p>It will be interesting to see if they ever release a second model, the way they eventually put out different lines of iPods. Maybe something bigger and less flashy, but with a keypad and way better voice. I won't hold my breath, but it might work.",1223535493

327576,comment,327441,327518,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'm curious why you believe GOOG will be trading at around 3 times earnings?  That just doesn't even make sense to me, and I'm having a hard time imagining <i>anything</i> short of total economic collapse that could lead to such an unlikely scenario.<p>While GOOG may not be bottomed out at ~$340 (I bought a few shares at $349, and am pretty happy with the price...and if it keeps dropping, I'll buy more, once it starts climbing again), I just don't see how you can possibly imagine it's a $40-$50 stock.  Terrible companies trade at better than three times earnings, average companies trade at 10 times earning, and I don't think anyone is going to accuse Google of being a terrible, or even an average company.  Google would pretty much have to start bleeding money to trade as low you're suggesting is inevitable.",1223535185

Hopefully somebody finds this as awesome as I did.<p>Alternatively: if people know of similar sites, for product design or for any field, really, I'd love to know of the link. It's when you see sites like this that you realize how little you know of so much: it's like the article on the world's greatest chef from a little while ago. I didn't <i>know</i> there was such a thing as deconstructionist cooking before then. With this, I never realized that there must be organizations of designers and such until I saw this.",1223534656

Sometimes (like today) I need to work outside in - and guess what - there is a printout of a big block of code on my desk just so that I can track every aspect of what is going on while I rewrite a key routine. It has to be many months since I did something like that but right now it is exactly the right way to tackle a problem.",1223534240

327563,comment,327279,327516,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Yeah, I lived through several Office Max/Office Depot/Walmart chairs.  They're kinda like inkjet printers...they wear out so fast, and work so poorly, that when you finally break down and buy a laser printer (or good quality chair), you look back and think, ""What kind of idiot must I be to keep going back and buying the same crappy thing over and over and expecting it to be any different?""  Sure, I'd buy different brands and models every time, just like with chairs, but in the end the level of quality at that end of the market for those particular goods just isn't worth buying at any price.  I've now had the same chair and the same color laser printer for many years, and several times the lifespan of a cheap office chair or an inkjet printer.  Both have provided fantastic value, and are still working great, and I expect to get another several years out of both of them.  I just wish I'd learned that lesson a little earlier in life.<p>And, I agree on keyboards, though the longevity of even good keyboards is not <i>quite</i> comparable.  But, when I found a keyboard I liked a few years ago (an IBM small form-factor keyboard, where escape, function row and the number pad are all closer to home), I bought two of them--I'm still using the first, and the second is ready to step in at the first signs of breakage in the first.",1223534103

In other words, they're not affected by the powerful.<p>To me, the key point is not whether someone else has the money to pursue their dreams, it's whether I have the freedom to pursue mine.

I don't like that.<p>The homepage — ticket buying visitors likely don't give a crap about anything but the search box and the ""upcoming events"" bit. Personally, I would treat the site as as just that — a site — rather than an app. Put some cool info and links to events on the homepage, to attract the people who are interested in what your service providers, but are not there exclusively for any tickets at that time; give them something to look at, and they will be more likely to return WHEN they need to buy tickets.<p>Maybe your being too much like Google, how many times does the average person search a day — compared to how many times they buy tickets? People always have something to search for, so Google quickly gets people coming back. You on the other hand, have to try harder to get people to remember you.",1223532724

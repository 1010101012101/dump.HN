There are so many vague patents given to companies already, that if everyone who has a patent actually started enforcing them at once, the entire tech industry could collapse within months.<p>The only reason this hasn't happened is because most companies are not that ""evil"" to actually try to use vague patents against other companies, and they just want to own them for defensive purposes (which wasn't the goal of patents at all).

I explained my position and expressed my desire to work on programming.

That's not to say that you're not happy with what you have or always unsatisfied. Only that you're always seeking to expand your ""life,"" whatever that means to you. To make your life abundant.

I happen to have a window open with the old design, so I know it's not merely my imagination that the new one is worse.  Not enormously so, but definitely worse.<p>Read mails are more legible in the old version, because there is more contrast between black letters and the old light blue background than between black and the new gray.<p>It's also harder to parse the list of emails visually in the new design.  In the old one, the 3D checkbox acted like a bullet point, and the name of the sender was closer to it.  Now the heavy checkbox has been replaced by a faint square, and the sender's name is about 2x further away from it.  So scanning my email is no longer like scanning a bulleted list.  It's just rows of text.<p>That's a big deal functionally.  There's a reason bulleted lists exist as a format, and removing the bullet points from the average bulleted list would make it significantly less legible.<p>It's a bummer to see Google making things work worse in order to make them look better (or worse still, more consistent).  That's the sort of thing big companies do.  Which I suppose Google now is.  But they had at least been trying not to act like one before.",1335074492

The things we make permanent fixtures in our environmentunless we have to interact with them or they changeultimately get accepted and forgotten. Many people really hate to accept this because it means that any positive changes that we create in our life will ultimately be eroded. A solution to this problem is one of my main preoccupations.<p>In the mean time, the question that should be being asked is how _exactly_ will you live your life differently in order to adhere to these standards? And apply that question to tomorrow, next week, next season, next year, and the next five years. You could try writing a plan but then plans fail because they speculate.

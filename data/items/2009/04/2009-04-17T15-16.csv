567137,comment,566609,566609,0,0,varun,,,"For AJAX-based web applications, following is what I'd suggest in making things very zippy for the user:<p>1. Concatenate your JS and CSS files. Don't send out several files over the wire to the browser - the browser can only make 2 connections at a time. Be careful about JS dependencies - order is imp. in JS.<p>2. Minify and then compress the JS and CSS. Use Dojo's Shrinksafe or the YUI Compressor to do this. It will strip out whitespace, etc - make the code smaller in size (In JS, every byte counts) and compress.<p>3. Now gzip the above. (Paul's article talks only about gzipping - if you do the above 2 steps as well, you'd improve the performance a lot more).<p>Write an Ant script to automate all the above on code commit and you are done. Try other methods like loading other elements in the background or after a tab etc is clicked - important to show something to the user almost instantly. Did this for Alertle.com, which was a 100% AJAX web app (no page refresh at all), and the initial size of the code being sent to the browser went from 700k to about 20k using the steps above :)",1239983603

I have previously returned music to a store within my stautory rights period.<p>Besides even if you do make a fair point lets reverse the situation: is it right to nick a CD from the store if you go back later to either put it on the shelf if you dont like it or pay for it if you do?<p>Anyway; Im not so much talking music you dont like actually (sorry, my fault). My point was focused on music you find acceptable and still would listen to occasionally but dont think is worth £9.99 or however much an album purchase is near you. I know several people with HUGE illegal music collections that would cost them thousands of pounds to purchase - how do they choose what to pay for, what to keep and what they should delete.

You can't test scale with a limited number of users by defintion. A service which still loses data in corner cases, exposes private information unintentionally and so on is better off in an acknowledged private beta than suffering the incredibly bad press and resentment of users which will arise in these scenarios.<p>Also, not all software is built equal. Twitter is strongly affected by network effects, the more people using it, the more valuable it becomes, so getting people signed up is more important than ironing out every bug. However the likes of gmail is weakly affected as you can still email all of your mates whether they use gmail or not.

This is never to be done at home, though. It's done in a hospital or clinic, because it's a place that will be hated and where the person rightly won't want to return to.<p>I remember being in a mental hospital ward as a young adult and thoughts going from ""I hate the world and I wish I was dead"" to ""If only I could go out in the sun and get some ice cream."" This hospital had a beautiful garden outside which you could see from the barred windows and a quiosk where they sold ice cream. Man, did I enjoy that ice cream once I was allowed to go out for it! When was I finally released from the hospital (on the condition of doing therapy, which I quit soon I could, because it was humilliating) my family took me out to the cinema, to buy videogames and I had no restrictions on Internet and going out with my friends (I was not a minor anymore, so I guess it was easier for them to respect me.)<p>The experience was undignifying and I still have a grudge against my parents for it, since they got the necessary documents to forcefully sign me into hospital. I still love them and we talk but I prefer to live in another country. I also never completely got rid of my suicidal thoughts up to this day (over a decade after) nor did the experience scared me out to try suicide a second time. Still, it might have solved the immediate emergency then. I don't know.<p>The most terrible thing about hospitalization is the forced medication, which is brain damaging and useless. The mind is not ill, just wrong.<p>So I'm sure there is a better way to help. But whatever you do, have this in mind:<p>One's home should always be one's home. It should be a person's private space. It should be a welcoming place where the person longs to be in. Your daugher should have her own room, her own computer, her own things, her own friends and her freedom back. She should not be spyed upon by her own family. That will just make her paranoid. If her own family is out to get her, who isn't?<p>Understand that a person is motivated to live when they can be free, when they can have a good life by their own standards. So help her get a life she wants to live. listen to her. What does she like? Get her more of that.<p>Also, get her some Ayn Rand. Ayn Rand is great because she gets to the roots of the self-esteem problem. Teenagers that read Ayn Rand love life, and behave like they are invincible. I wish I had read her then.

1281547,comment,1281510,1281510,0,0,_delirium,,,"Wow, this is pretty lame. The various stuff I've become a ""fan"" of (apparently now renamed ""like"") was under the understanding, explicitly stated by Facebook, that it wasn't part of the public information. Seems they changed that without warning or opt-out? Is there at least an easy way to quickly remove all the hundreds of things I've become a fan of before Google starts indexing them, if I'd prefer them not to be indexed?<p>What I'm getting from this is that you should assume that <i>all</i> your Facebook information is publicly available, and act accordingly, because they could make it so at any time. At this rate of trustworthiness, I wouldn't be that surprised if in 2 years status updates were made retroactively public with no opt-out (and maybe without even telling you).<p>Edit: Is this even legal? Consider the following scenario: Someone signed up for a Facebook account 3 years ago, and entered some of this information, at a time when their privacy policy explicitly promised that the information would not be shared. They have not logged in since, so cannot be said to have even implicitly agreed to a change in the privacy policy (and Facebook has not mailed out any notice of the change). Now their information is made public, in violation of the privacy policy. Not sure how easy it'd be to enforce, but at the very least it seems <i>sleazy</i>.",1271832993

1281545,comment,1281270,1281507,0,0,pavs,,,"> But I'd doubt google bought it for the same reason as apple bought semi-pa. Google seems pretty adament on working qith existing handset providers.<p>Apple made their first Phone with Motorola.[1] It is not easy to enter a hardware industry; more so if you have no prior experience with consumer hardware market (unlike Apple). I think its more likely that Google was testing the water with Nexus One to see how people will react to it and how the process of manufacturing phones work. If I remember correctly they worked closely with HTC and had quite a bit influence on how the final product will look like. Remember, they are also working on a slate device and a net-book device, which will debut sometime this year. While this acquisition might not have any direct relation to the Google hardware devices coming out this year. I think it is highly likely that they might start building their own devices with custom processors soon.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2005/09/07/the-motorola-rokr-e1-apple-itunes-phone/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engadget.com/2005/09/07/the-motorola-rokr-e1-appl...</a>",1271832850

They are there at the will of the democratically elected Iraqi government in a deployment sanctioned by the UN Security Council. It should be possible to acknowledge this fact even while disagreeing with the presence of US forces in Iraq.<p>Nor do I believe the US military had an obligation to release the video, although they did have an obligation to conduct a serious and thorough investigation and make the results and key aspects of it public. I think it's clear this didn't happen, but it did not justify Wikileaks's heavily edited and flawed version of the video.",1271832541

1281532,comment,1280561,1280561,0,0,rdl,,,"I was in Iraq when this happened.  It is a fairly representative incident -- the only remarkable thing is that Reuters people were involved.  There have been plenty of within-rules shootings which led to the deaths of civilians, but there were also plenty of situations where the rules hindered successful operations or even self-defense.  It's a balancing act, and it's war, so it's choosing among least-bad options, with imperfect information.<p>It's fair to criticize the Rules of Engagement as being overly hostile to civilians, and counter to the goal of winning and leaving.  In Afghanistan, GEN McChrystal actually stopped a lot of effective tactics (night raids, airstikes, etc.) because they were counter to the strategy of winning the war by winning the populace.  In Iraq, there were periods of intense kinetic violence (such as going into Baquba, Sadr city, Fallujah) combined with periods of reconstruction and trying to win the populace.<p>I actually knew Julian Assange from running a remailer long before wikileaks, and he seemed like a pretty decent guy.  I'm not sure what happened.  I'm betting he/they felt marginalized and were trying to use this to raise their own profile.

Maybe Mahmud's right and there would be a new diversity of real-world applications; that would be nice.<p>A more pressing question is what would happen to QPX, ITA's flight search system. Google's policy of making acquired companies rewrite their software according to Google's standards would, if applied, mean rewriting QPX in C++, Java, or Python. Given how often QPX has been cited as a system that leverages the power of Common Lisp to do complex things, that would be an interesting thing to follow. I bet Google wouldn't do that, though. For an acquisition of this size (the article says $1B), the rules are probably different. (Did they rewrite Youtube?) I must say it would be neat to see Google break their no-Lisp policy.<p>(As a side note, it's true that if you don't care that much about continuing to evolve a complex Lisp system, it's often possible to rewrite it in a less powerful language; you just end up with a larger and less changeable codebase.)",1271831115

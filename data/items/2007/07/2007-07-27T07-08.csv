1) Where else could you find college students having to answer similar questions?
2) This would basically replace my ""developing for the hell of it"" time, which is what usually leads to my startup ideas. It's very tempting...college is expensive.<p>Oh, and FYI it's a company that I've been interning for over the summer, i.e. I already know their systems, my coworkers like me, and my code is already proven to be good.",1185522737
37042,story,,,1,1,bkrausz,"How much is your time at college worth?",,"I've recently been asked by a large (massive) company to give them an hourly rate to do software engineering during college as a consultant.  I've only ever quoted small companies with little jobs before, never dealing with the big fish.  My question to YC is how much you would charge?  All the standard formulas don't apply since I have no expenses other than time here.",1185522610

Ads are inherently useful - when they're relevant. Cool ads are entertainment in themselves. Anyone remember adcritic.com? Welcome to my Friday nights in college...<p>b - pass voting data back to the advertisers in some meaningful way. Haven't thought this through yet...",1185520432

Even if you just get your friends to add your app to try it out - that gets broadcast to all of their friends who look at the news feed (I'd guess that few people don't). And if any of their friends are bored and happen to try out your application, then it keeps rippling out.<p>The trick of course, is to build something compelling. The platform will only mature with time, and the really compelling applications - that aren't just profile-based applications, or aren't heavily rooted in a site off of Facebook - haven't been built yet.<p>That's where you come in :)",1185520154

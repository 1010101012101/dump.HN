3064297,comment,3063156,3063317,7,0,pasbesoin,,,"Look closely at the image he includes.  He draws a line diagonally through each of the respective Apple and Ubuntu menu headings being discussed, in each case from the upper, outer corner of the menu item to the opposite, lower, inner corner.  This line forms an angle with the neighboring vertical edge of the corresponding menu (which is more or less also the edge of the display area/screen).  That angle is what he is describing.<p>In Apple's case, the angle is wider, making it -- in his description -- easier to move the pointer from the menu header, after triggering the menu, onto the menu items.  In Ubuntu's case, the angle is narrower.  Further, in the Ubuntu case, since the menu text is justified against the far side of the menu, the pointer has to travel further to hover over it and, for the top few items, that travel cannot be a straight line because a straight line would cross the neighboring menu header and so trigger the neighboring menu to drop down.  At least, that's how I interpret his argument.<p>Looking further at his image, I notice that he is including some horizontal space between the Apple menu header and the screen edge as being part of the Apple menu; however, that area carries a different coloration.  Not having a Mac at hand, I'm unable to test whether that area also functions are part of the Apple menu header.  If not, then he's calculated the Apple ""angle of escape"" incorrectly.<p>Also, on my installation of Ubuntu 11.04, running Gnome Classic (aka 2.whatever), in the menu under discussion, one does not have to hover over the text in order to activate a menu entry.  In my view, this makes the ""angle of escape"" argument somewhat less important -- at least, under Gnome 2.x -- in that one can use menu items by moving the pointer in more of a ""straight down"" direction.  Although, the inclination may still be to move the pointer over the menu item text, thus requiring the user to learn to avoid attempting such a straight line pointer movement for the first few menu items on this menu.  I don't know whether Unity -- the Ubuntu desktop environment he is actually describing -- handles these menu entries and their activation differently (my Ubuntu machine's old graphics processor can't handle Unity -- to which I sort of say, yay!).",1317595902

3064272,comment,3062984,3063381,4,0,coldarchon,,,"There is something behind this that people from genetics and evolutionists don't talk about and even don't want you to know. The reason why there are so many men in our history who were prodigies is very simple, and not a result of female oppression. The genes of men are much more randomly activated/mutated/spread than those of women. Why? Because changing the genes of women could be dangerous to giving birth or raise children. As men can have much more children than women, let's call the reason ""nature"", nature decided that women have a dense distribution of qualities and men a very high variance. You can see this in the distribution of shoe sizes, the number of men with small feet is the same as those with big feet. And women all have the same, ask Al Bundy.
Now if men have a much higher variance in their genes, chances are this affects their way to understand problems and therefor the huge mass of different approaches and a wider spectrum will produce solutions in a collective much faster than in the dense normal distribution of women.
If we now keep on insisting that all humans are the same and no one is different and therefor better at understanding a specific problem, we might never solve a problem if it's not in the solution space of our normal distribution of the average human.

I think its safe to assume that the NYT wouldn't lie about this, so point taken.<p>As for the boreholes intersecting all layers from surface to source location, this is true of all boreholes used in oil and gas production.  These are legally required to be sealed from surrounding aquifer layers.  I say legally here speaking as an Ontarian, I do not know what the case in individual states are.  Which is not to say that this is a risk-free process.  But the risk is no greater or worse than with conventional oil and gas production.<p>I am not sure what you mean by depressurizing aquifers.  I either understand this as causing subsidence by soil consolidation due to decreased pore fluid pressures, as happened in New Orleans during the 20th century (which to the best of my knowledge they are now trying to control).  I can also understand this as generally depleting an aquifer, as is going on with the Ogallala Aquifer in what I would describe as the south-central United States.  Some clarification is perhaps in order.<p>You are correct that the recharge time on many aquifers of importance is thousands or more years.  The Ogallala Aquifer, for instance, is usually considered to be a 'fossil aquifer' since it is not expected to recharge on a human/engineering time scale.<p>As for my use of qualifiers, I was just trying to be honest about the unknowns.  From my understanding, limited as it is, I see cautious development in the field as a reasonable course of action.  There is risk.  I would even agree that the risk is probably greater than that of conventional oil and gas production.  But we are also in need of more energy.  I fully support renewables and conservation and would like nothing better than to see humanity moving beyond fossil fuels.  Unconventional gas (and natural gas as a whole) is seen as a stepping stone to help bridge between oil and renewables.",1317595015

I believe more is at fault here.<p>Unless I'm mistaken, tax payers in a particular school district (or county) fund the school district they're part of.

3064187,comment,3062473,3062473,3,0,phaus,,,"PayPal has turned into just another mechanism for online fraud. Basically the way it works in the past few years is a customer can buy whatever they want from you using a credit card linked to their PayPal account. As soon as they get the item, they cancel the transaction and tell their credit card company that their card was used in a fraudulent manner without their knowledge. The credit card company then seizes the funds and PayPal is left in a situation where they can either eat the cost of the item and give you the money, or their ""investigator"" can find you at fault and force you to eat the loss. Because they don't have the power to challenge the credit card companies, they side with the customer almost 100 percent of the time and then stick you with the bill.<p>With non-tangible items, such as calling card codes, video game subscriptions, and digital items, there is pretty much nothing you can do to get your money. PayPal has act to like it has investigated the situation fairly, so they tell you that they sided with the customer no matter what evidence you have presented them with.<p>Unfortunately, this type of behavior is largely why eBay is in decline. My parents ran an online antique business in their spare time but they were forced to shut it down because it no longer felt safe. Personally, I've been on both sides of a PayPal dispute. When I almost lost a few hundred dollars selling a non-tangible item(luckily the item was recovered), the PayPal customer support rep told me that it didn't really matter what evidence I furnished and that if I wanted to sell something similar in the future, that I should try to deal locally because being scammed on PayPal has become an epidemic.",1317593240

3064176,comment,3063167,3063167,5,0,23david,,,"I think that the prevalence of manic-depressive (bipolar) illness among software entrepreneurs is many times greater than that of the general population. Many of the symptoms characterizing manic or hypomanic behavior are possibly extremely helpful for software entrepreneurs and I would argue that founders exhibiting manic-depressive characteristics have a higher rate of success than those without such traits.<p>However, success is really dependent on founders being careful to manage their symptoms to avoid the 'burn-out/depression' cycles that generally follow the manic and hypomanic cycles. It IS possible to have some measure of control or regulation of these cycles by some combination of medication, careful diet, proper sleep, CBT (Cognitive-Behavior Therapy) or Psychoanalysis. And there are lots of books on Amazon discussing these topics (but very very few reliable online websites). But this is more of an ART than a science and it can take a very very long time to figure out the proper balance.<p>The main main issue for all software entrepreneurs with manic-depressive illness is that they need to avoid having their entrepreneur lifestyle trigger their mania/hypomania episodes and run out of control.<p>And I would wonder if the caffeine-fueled programmer paradigm actually leads to stress-related brain damage that makes software entrepreneurs more susceptible to full-blown manic-depression. A kind of entrepreneur PTSD.<p>The article is good if it spurs people to do more research on their own and to seek out professional evaluations (from people very experienced with bipolar/manic-depression. not just anyone please...) if they have a sense that something about their moods just might be a bit <i>off</i>.<p>The average time from onset to diagnosis of manic-depression/bipolar is approximately 10 years. An entire decade lost. Greater awareness of manic-depressive illness and its causes might help entrepreneurs create companies that are more conducive towards promoting mental health. How many companies have utterly failed after a co-founder or key programmer hits a depressive cycle and is suddenly completely able to perform their jobs?<p>I'm speaking from my own experience here: I only sought out help after starting and having only marginal success with 3 startups. After a decade of these failures I had the sinking  feeling that something was wrong with me and I couldn't justify placing the blame on my co-founders and <i>poor market conditions</i>. And then after eliminating sugar and white flour from my diet and take small doses of lithium I finally realized how <i>off</i> I had really been all this time.<p>I think it'll take a few more years at least before I have a full understanding of the illness and how to best manage it.    It'll be expensive to see all these specialists, etc. but the alternatives are severe depressive, likely financial ruin and a high chance of eventual suicide.<p>A few books that helped me learn more about manic-depressive illness (and made me feel like there was actually hope...):<p>- Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament by Dr. Kay Jameson
-- Documents how creativity and manic-depressive illness are linked, and discusses the prevalence of mood disorders among the most famous artists and writers in Western culture.<p>- An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness by Dr. Kay Jameson
-- The author is a clinical psychologist and wrote this breakthrough memoir revealing her own battles against manic-depressive illness.<p>- Loving Someone with Bipolar Disorder by Julie Fast
-- This is extremely useful for founders who may have a member or their team or company that does have or seems to have manic-depressive illness. It helps explain how to communicate with manic-depressive friends/loved-ones in a way that they can hear you, particularly when they are in the midst of a manic/hypomanic cycle. And it will help you learn how to avoid triggering manic/depressive episodes.<p>Nutrition-related resources are a bit more complicated and if you have the resources I would suggest consulting with a professional with training in Orthomolecular Psychiatry. These types of people are MD's so they can prescribe medications and know a lot about medications, and they also know about nutrition and its interaction with medications and mental health. The combination of these skills is extremely important when you are dealing with serious medications like lithium and also changing your diet, since medication and diet interact with each other in complicated ways. But the people who possess both types of knowledge are very rare, and there aren't too many of them around. If you are in the Berkeley area I would recommend seeing Dr. Michael Lesser. If he doesn't have open appointment times he can probably refer you to reliable colleagues of his.<p>But in the meantime the basic advice that he gave me is:<p>- try and completely eliminate white sugar and white flour from your diet.
-- Switch to using honey as a sweetener and 100% whole wheat bread.<p>- reduce caffeine intake to around 1 cup of coffee in the morning or switch to tea instead if that works for you.<p>- Make sure to get as much high-quality sleep as your body really needs.
-- this is the hardest one for me... still working on it.",1317592832
3064175,comment,3062984,3063707,5,0,chernevik,,,"Absolutely.  But I also question the criteria of the hypercompetition, and the judges' valuation of the signals.  Volunteer work in a Guatemalan day care center may indicate altruism and awareness, right up the moment when it becomes an aid, or a requirement, of Harvard admission.  Likewise the school paper.  Maybe the insistence on being ""well-rounded"" pushes kids outside a purely academic focus, and gets them exposed to things they might otherwise miss.  But how much will a kid get from an experience without an interior interest?  ""Gotta go check the 'well-rounded' box.""<p>Likewise I wonder about the curriculum they have to hit.  If they are doing so much homework, why aren't they more numerate, why aren't they more familiar with the underpinnings of our literature and history?  Why isn't Harvard conducting interviews in foreign languages?<p>We've made a grueling admissions process that measures compliance with a particular norm of social and political values, and tries to be ""academically rigourous"" without suggesting that particular topics are especially important or essential.<p>And why, exactly, is Harvard so much more important than Brown, and Brown than Wesleyan?  The education available at these cannot be so different as the quality of the social network established.  Now networks are extraordinarily important, but are the Harvard grads _learning_ that much more after college? or is the difference in their positioning for various status competitions?<p>It's hardly surprising that this process perpetuates the same status structure that determines its rewards and criteria.  Those rewards and criteria are stated in vague but emphatic terms, which can only be judged subjectively.  Is it any wonder that the process seems crazy? or that makes suspicious the very notion of ""excellence"" supposedly at its core?",1317592816

You could flip a fair coin 25 times in a row and come up with heads each time -- it's just pretty damn unlikely.  Similarly, I'd bet what he's measured is really this: you have two equally sized groups, one treated, one untreated.  In group one you get a rate of x, and in group two, you get a rate of y.  How big does |y-x| and the size of the two groups have to be to conclude it was not just chance?  As below, a t-test can help you answer that.",1253782603

840830,comment,840702,840779,0,0,timr,,,"The result can <i>always</i> be due to chance.  Confidence intervals let you estimate how <i>likely</i> it is that your results are due to chance.  In this case, the results are unlikely to be random -- but it's always possible.  That's all he was saying.  Maybe this study was the 1 in 10,000 that would randomly show a 30% difference in infection rates.  Is that likely?  No.  Is it possible?  Sure.  Anything's possible.<p>Confidence intervals get smaller as you include more people in an experiment, but they get smaller more slowly as more people are added.  So it's fairly easy to go from a 2% to a 1% confidence interval by adding a couple thousand people, but it takes a lot more people to go from 1% to 0.5%.  And of course, it's asymptotic -- you'll never get to zero.<p>That said, in this case, the point is academic.  This study was large enough that the confidence interval is going to be well below 30%.",1253782404

Given that a lot of computer ""science"" is an applied ""science"" (I use scare quotes deliberately because I think some of the ""science"" content is dubious), the ""theoretical"" distinction makes it obvious that you're talking about a <i>theory</i> of computer science, not the application of those theoretical concepts to create things.<p>> <i>It is my experience that people in casual conversations automatically assume topic to be complexity theory, despite I'm in Europe.</i><p>What one community decides to define itself as isn't really a concern of mine.  I'm also in Europe and I've found that ""theoretical computer science"" is pretty widely understood to mean the kinds of things I'm arguing that it means.<p>> <i>It would be a bit like calling category theory a ""theoretical mathematics""</i><p>So why would it make any more sense to apply it to complexity theory?

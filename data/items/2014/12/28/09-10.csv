8805874,comment,8802414,8805785,0,0,akiselev,,,"I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t really give a straight answer to that question because it really depends on the context and risk-reward calculations. If the entire design revolves around that specific part and it&#x27;s specialized, it&#x27;s much riskier than if the part is more commoditized (e.g. power or ethernet) and there is money in the budget to risk a partial redesign based on part availability. If there is an experienced supply chain gal on the ground in China with a Rolodex of contacts, who speaks the language, and knows how to spot fakes the enterprise is much less risky than if you&#x27;re doing the shopping yourself (or remotely which is a crapshoot). If it&#x27;s a low margin product you might not have a choice but if it&#x27;s a high margin product you probably don&#x27;t want to risk the reputation. If it&#x27;s a part that requires software such as a driver on the microprocessor, then you&#x27;re in a whole other world of risk management dependent on manufacturer software quality and support. So on and on. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t know of any great resources that exhaustively detail this thought process (although I&#x27;m sure some are out there), although you can always look into systems engineering, which is a whole field dedicated to understanding how to manage complex engineering projects.<p>Electrical engineering is all about trade offs and constraints which range from physical board size to manufacturing/assembly cost to R&D deadlines to software support. I would err on the side of investing more money into proper part selection and designing from the start with part swapping in mind because unlike with software, success or failure can be very binary with little room for error. The Shenzhen markets are great because I usually have to work under extreme deadlines that don&#x27;t gel well with the pace of suppliers and my deliverables are at least several steps away from full production.",1419759958

It provides a thorough explanation of the polynomials, but it fails to explain the very basics of how the curves are laid out on the plane.<p>It does a nice work of explaining how a <i>circle</i> is drawn, but its explanation of how x and y are calculated for a Bézier curve doesn&#x27;t make sense to me: &quot;Bézier curves use the &quot;binomial polynomial&quot; for both x and y.&quot; If the same function on &quot;t&quot; is used for both x and y, they would always have the same value, and the &quot;curve&quot; is always a diagonal with 45 degrees. What am I missing? I can&#x27;t infer it from the tutorial.<p>Also, it introduces the idea of a &quot;control point&quot; and starts using it, but never manages to <i>define</i> what it is, or how it is represented in the equation or graphically. It merely labels some curves as &quot;P1&quot;, &quot;P2&quot;... in the graphs and telss that these somehow change the shape of the curves, and tells us that they have an associated linear &quot;wi&quot; weight; but again, the way in which the (x1, y1) pairs are connected to the binomial and polynomial term is never spelled out, and left as an exercise to the reader.<p>Things are further complicated by the mysterious &quot;strength&quot; parameter &quot;S&quot; in the graphs, which is also unexplained, never used again, and appears right when we&#x27;re trying to understand the difficult concept of a control point to further confuse things.

I&#x27;ve quit smoking for about a year and a half, probably 3 of the last 8 years combined have been not smoking. Smoking is harder for me, as it not only requires a pretty vast social adjustment (avoid smokers at first, pass each and every willpower check), and stress brings it out of me like crazy. You need to have something else to replace the quick shots of dopamine you can get any time you want. I am currently working on new habits, and have my diet under control again after gaining some of that weight back. Next is exercise. One thing at a time.",1419758302

Initially, the header was opt-in, but with the introduction of IE10, Microsoft decided that the option was going to be opt-out. Once the the DNT header was gaining traction and a not-so-small percentage of people began sending the header, the companies had no reason to comply, and the initiative sorta fell out of favor.<p>For blocking tracking, the most effective tools are browser extensions made to block ads. Ghostery provides comparisons on an non-biased website between the methods of blocking tracking through browser modifications [1]. According to the site, the Do Not Track header actually has an effect with a difference of 18% in cookie size when the header is set. AdBlock Edge and disabling third-party cookies results in a 59% and 40% decrease in cookie size respectively. It seems that the easiest thing you can do to lessen your internet footprint would be to disable third-party cookies and enable the DNT header, and the majority of tracking can be eliminated through the use of a browser extension. (But with the recent revelations [2], using a browser extension may actually reduce your browsing experience if you don&#x27;t have the RAM to spare.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.areweprivateyet.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.areweprivateyet.com/</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8802424"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8802424</a>",1419757669

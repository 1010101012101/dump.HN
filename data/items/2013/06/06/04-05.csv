If you accuse the NSA of committing crimes that are only slightly unethical (wiretapping US citizens), then you're instantly on ""the list"" of arguably the most powerful organization in the world.<p>Not only would the story just end up being, ""oh well, greater good"", but the NSA would just slightly back off of the monitoring, then make sure that future leaks such as this do not happen again.<p>They are not an evil nor dark organization, just one with a very important mission, and when you have the real big picture on the table sometimes the unethical option is required to maintain dominance and security.<p>Imagine having the responsibility of protecting a country that is the #1 target in the world, that has 300+ million people within its borders that have the potential to cause major harm to the country, its citizens, and its allies. The NSA doesn't have a choice but to do everything in its power to maintain information dominance over the world.<p>The NSAs mission statement requires it to protect the US and provide foreign sigint.

I did the same thing about a year ago, working for federally funded science. The worst decisions on earth were made, money was wasted AND they complained about budget cuts.

I quit, had no job lined up, went on vacation while emailing my contacts about jobs, came back with a job. Done and done.

I'm not sure what ""immediate and eventual haul"" means. It sounds like you feel some personal or professional motivation to help the project, even if you have already ""checked out"".<p>I recommend that you start your job hunt immediately, network with positive and connected people in the organization while you still can, leave a good impression with your managers if possible, and generally avoid rocking the boat.<p>Even though it may feel cathartic, burning bridges is unproductive.

HR loves it because it's documentation (for any potential discrimination lawsuits). In fact, that could be half your sales pitch. Sell it to HR as a tool to protect the company legally and to hiring managers as a way to more objectively measure candidates.<p>It could be useful for phone screens or in-person interviews.

This tells the creators that they're doing good work and that they shouldn't abandon their babies (yet), they might just need to tweak things here and there.<p>Conversely, tearing someone to pieces is mean and not productive, even if the points are valid. There are arguments for this that generally go along the lines of some Darwinian thinking where they shouldn't even be trying if they can't take criticism - that's unrealistic and unfair to expect of people. We all need to start somewhere. Help out fellow members.<p>Hacker News is not a trial by fire - nor is it meant to encourage a death march. Those are two extremes. A comfortable middle ground where both criticism and praise are given is optimum. And I find there is rarely a submission so bad there's nothing good to be said about if at all.",1370494216

California is going to be a pain in the ass. Just the way it is. If you don't like that, move to Texas, or better yet, Wyoming.<p>One thing to consider: if you have an LLC with one member (owner), you can have the IRS treat it as a ""disregarded entity"" which saves you a some work on tax day. You basically fold the business taxes into your personal taxes and file one return. You still <i>must</i> keep <i>everything</i> (bank accounts, etc) separate for the business - keep the books on the business just like normal.

Also development of quality sprocs is qualitatively <i>different</i> than upper level app code (among other things, you want a single large query front and center to the extent possible), and so if you write stored procedures the way you write application code <i>they will suck.</i><p>Now, what we do with LedgerSMB is build our stored procedures as basically named queries, inspired by web services (both SOAP and REST have been inspirations there).  The procedures are intended to be relatively discoverable at runtime, with the aggressive attempts to use what infrastructure exists for this purpose that REST gives for HTTP.<p>Stored procedures are not a problem.  They allow you to encapsulate a database behind an API, and the desire to do that is a major point of Martin Fowler's NoSQL advocacy (arguing for doing this for NoSQL dbs).",1370491374

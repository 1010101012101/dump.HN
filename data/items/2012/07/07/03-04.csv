It was supposed to crawl the top seller products every night and show them in a cool way. I had no freaking idea about Clojure and it turned out to be quite a complex task with no previous experience, so 4 weeks into this, I decided to give it a try with my language of choice (Ruby, I used Sinatra for routing basically) and I put this up in.. 1 day? \nIt only crawls the top selling categories that are shown on the bar, the rest of the items are pulled from the Amazon API on request. Last year I created a very successful android app that made me earn a good steady income (about $400/month), but in order to do so I spent like 2 weeks looking for the appropriate market where I had essentially no competition and a huge amount of users looking for something. Here I'm basically out with no idea about how to make people buy here instead of just going to Amazon.com.<p>So my question is, how would you guys make this be more compelling so people would actually go here instead of Amazon to look for stuff? SEO? Emailing people? New features? Less features?\nNo idea about how to sell this and I want to do this also as an exercise to learn how to bring customers.<p>PS: I'm already learning Clojure through ""The joy of clojure"" and I'm LOVING it.",1341632519

We've been neglecting Thunderbird for so long that it's not like anyone's going to notice. After all, it took us 10 years to get Sunbird (Mozilla's Standalone Calendar Client) to version 1.0.""<p>And the other part of me saw this while reading the letter: ""The era of desktop software is coming to an end. Most people have smart phones, multiple computers, and use web-mail to keep it all in sync and accessible across all of their devices. Desktop email client users make up a small percentage of users and there's no reason for us to keep spending money and resources on something that will one day be emulated by a web interface.""<p>=== Things Wrong With Thunderbird That Will Probably Never Get Fixed (too expensive / not worth it) ===<p>- The biggest problem with Thunderbird is that it tries to be a bare-bones email client with poorly integrated functionality in the form of third party add-ons. What really makes email clients shine is when a lot of usable features are tightly integrated with a very intuitive and snappy interface. Thunderbird out of the box comes with so few features that it can't compete well with web mail and when you do add on much needed features, they just get generically ""bolted on"" to the interface. Sometimes in ways that just seem unintuitive and backwards. And every time you update Thunderbird, ALL of your add-ons are rendered useless and you have to wait days/weeks/indefinitely for the addon to be updated. This is the biggest downfall of Thunderbird in my eyes. You'd have to redesign Thunderbird and that isn't happening, it isn't worth it.<p>- By default Thunderbird tries to send all my outgoing mail through 1 smtp account. This alone causes so many problems. Each email account should send emails from its own stmp. Not doing so can mark your ""from"" field incorrectly (has happened to me many times), trigger red flags (happened to me before) and make other email clients mark your email as ""Gmail thinks this message is a scam"".<p>- The SPAM filter in Thunderbird is A.W.F.U.L. Let me repeat that A-W-F-U-L. Despite training it for years it routinely misses the same spam, with the same title, and the same content, while sometimes marking very important emails as junk.<p>- The time and date selector for Lightning is just atrocious to the point where I hate having to use it. It FORCES me to set everything in military time and makes date selection more cumbersome than it needs to be.<p>- The tasks todo list for Lightning has never worked for me. Never.<p>- Thunderbird is stuck to one device (desktop). Technically you can have Thunderbird across a lot of computers by using IMAP instead of POP3 but that slows down and cancels out a lot of your speed benefits.<p>=== Why Mozilla Should Fix Them ===<p>- Originally I had typed up a HUGE list of things that desktop email clients can do that web mail clients cannot. Upon further inspection I found that a LOT of those features, everything from multiple accounts being displayed in one stream and searching across multiple accounts is now available in gmail.<p>- Email Clients allow me to have full control over my email inboxes and contacts without having to feed them into gmail.<p>- Email Clients give me a lot of options in how I can display, index, read, and write email.<p>- Email Clients allow me to search emails and contacts from across ALL my email accounts (gmail currently has a limit of 5 accounts).<p>- Email Clients allow you instant one click access to all your email accounts with powerful and expandable features, an intuitive and lightning fast interface, and god-like control over massive amounts of email accounts. For business people, entrepreneurs, assistants, community organizers, and domain owners email clients are a necessity.<p>- The same way power-users like using Seesmic for twitter and facebook, and people like downloading and using native apps over web based ones, the speed and control of software is what's keeping me with Email Clients at the moment.<p>- As soon as you have more than 5 email accounts to manage on a daily basis, the speed of an Email Client wins out. Gmail only allows 5 multiple accounts to be imported into your stream.<p>=== Why Mozilla Will NOT Fix Them And Instead Leave Thunderbird ===<p>- Everything I mentioned above is slowly getting emulated by web mail. At the moment gmail is the winner when it comes to email client emulation but in a few years I can see an elegant php+mysql web based email client that not only does exactly what Thunderbird does, but does it across all your devices. And without breaking all your addons after every update.<p>TLDR: The end is near for Outlook + Thunderbird + Mail + Evolution + The Others...",1341630771

If this were handled in the background in a separate thread that did not freeze the browser, no one would care about it except for privacy advocates who don't want their version number being leaked.<p>Then there are the popups and request to reboot that also interrupt the user's work process, given that the user has probably been trying to get work done while the download was going on.<p>2) Stupid versioning<p>For as long as software version numbers have existed, most vendors have used the major.minor.patch pattern. A change in the major version number usually means a break in the public API, so software vendors provide a different API library for every major version that they release, and they allow plugins to decide what API version to use.<p>Mozilla decided to increase their _major_ version number for every _patch_. Firefox's latest version 420 or however high they are now should probably be something like 4.2.20. \nThe stupid numbering will only annoy users who expect Mozilla to follow best software development practices, but it shouldn't affect plugins. If Firefox is doing their updates correctly, they will be exposing a separate API library for every major version update that they've done in their rapid major version update schedule.<p>Of course, they're doing it wrong. Plugins built for version 4 or version 5 no longer work because FF is only providing the latest API version 420, and only until next week when 421 comes out. Mozilla's solution is for all plugin vendors to update their plugins after every FF update, and for users to wait until the plugin vendors have done this.<p>There would be no plugin breakage if Mozilla had updated the patch and minor version numbers for non-breaking updates. I've said this on /. but the Moz devs argued that their choice was between rapid major version updates or no updates at all. I find that hard to believe. Something is wrong with their toolkit if they cannot support minor version number updates.",1341630757

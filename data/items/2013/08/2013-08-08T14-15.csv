If you think about collocation then it&#x27;s better but in your calculations include the fact that hardware breaks and with dedicated servers you get it fixed for free, when you buy the server yourself you have to buy anything that breaks and replace it. Almost always it means more of your time spent in dealing with it, more time of your users with lower quality/no service and it adds to the cost.
Of course it&#x27;s an option but you have to keep those things in mind. And before you do it I would search for some other provider of those dedicated solutions (or vps) before making that step",1375973959

There appeared to be no immediate repercussions, but then in April of 2013, Durov was accused of hitting a traffic policeman with his car, with a video of the alleged incident appearing online. On April 16, VKontakte&#x27;s main offices in central St. Petersburg were searched by police. Durov, who denies even owning a car, fled the country and has not been seen in public since.

So it becomes very difficult to chase and fix bugs or test the failures, even if you can test the failure on the 7 SDK and go back to the 6 SDK to test and submit -- you can see the problems that could arise from that. It would almost be like developing for Android! (only joking..)<p>Beta software is exactly that -- beta. Users should expect failures and problems, so giving any sort of review based on iOS7 beta software is absolutely ridiculous. The funny part is that the only people who should have the beta, should know better. But obviously they don&#x27;t. I wish there was a way to lock down access to the beta program to legitimate developers, but that&#x27;s impossible because it wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be a fair system. Although it could be possible to restrict beta access to developers who actually have a released app in the store. New devs could still use the existing SDK and tools and submit, but they wouldn&#x27;t necessarily have access to the betas. I don&#x27;t know what problem that would solve, however. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be a significant issue, except in app store reviews, so the simple solution is to restrict reviews to non-beta people and instead of reviews, iOS7 users can submit private bug reports. This way devs are aware of problems they might not know about but it doesn&#x27;t give the negative publicity that affects their sales. Several one-star reviews can kill a newer app before it even gets off the ground.<p>One potentially cool alternative is to allow devs to release iOS7 beta versions that are only accessibly to iOS7 beta users through the app store. However just as promo-code apps can&#x27;t be reviewed, the same logic should apply to iOS 7 beta users.",1375973310

MIT is a genuinely expensive place: the last time I knew the numbers, it spent about half your tuition on you in your freshman year and quite a bit more on average for the 3 remaining years.  STEM subjects are expensive, all have lab work, and one of the reasons MIT is MIT is that with the rare exception that proves the rule, all courses are taught by tenure track or tenured professors.<p>You can&#x27;t get tenure without being an adequate teacher and the vast, vast majority I knew really cared about teaching undergraduates.  The school also constantly makes sure the professors are doing an adequate job (I once both read all the student evaluations for a disaster (only one was not negative and she was a special case), and then overheard the department head tell the professor, who&#x27;s name you probably know, that he&#x27;d never be allowed to teach that particular course again), and e.g. has no hesitation about taking a course away from a professor who violates the rules like what can be asked for at the end of the term.<p>MIT is also in a very expensive location, the cost of living is very high.  That&#x27;s also true for many of the Ivies, Harvard up chuck river from it, Columbia in NYC, Princeton in NJ, etc.<p>3rd doesn&#x27;t apply so much to MIT, although, yeah, it has too large a bureaucracy like pretty much every other institution of higher education.

Over the years I&#x27;ve thought about this too (at least, I&#x27;ve worked the numbers a few times).  It&#x27;s hard to make it work; they need a minimum of 8TB of storage for existing material, then growth by about 2.5TB yearly (to date, but most are about to start time-lapse video).  Though, your cold storage approach is intriguing.<p>Napkin calculations:<p><pre><code>  0.04  /GB * 1000 = 40.00 /month (curr) =  480.00/yr
            * 2000 =                     =  960.00/yr
            * 3000 =                     = 1440.00/yr

  0.004 /GB * 8000 = 32.00 /month (cold) =  344.00/yr + 48.00/yr/TB
                                                      + 100.00/yr/2TB
                                                      + 175.00/yr/3.5TB

  1 shoot = 25GB (stills only) or 50GB w a 30 sec TL (add 25GB)

  ~100 shoots /yr ==> 2.5TB/yr @ 25GB, 5TB/yr @ 50GB

</code></pre>
[Aside, that&#x27;s 5-12 mins to upload (25Mbp/s - 10Mbp/s, only 3 mins @ 50Mbp/s).  So consider additional internet cost.]<p>Without frequently juggling current to cold, or doing yearly compounding calculations, I&#x27;d eyeball this at ~$1300/yr, with growth of $150/yr, each year.<p>One way to make this more attractive is to leverage the online storage to build other recurring-revenue generating services, but most photographers don&#x27;t go for that type of thing.  (In my experience, stock image sites, etc. are primarily the realm of hobbyists.)<p>You also have the trust/confidence problem.  I suspect every photographer will want to maintain their own backup as well.  So, they won&#x27;t &quot;save&quot; money (even if online storage was less expensive, but I suspect it&#x27;s not) because they still need to pay for local storage.  Of course, for apples to apples, you need to factor in time to maintain those backups, either my hourly rate or their own; things like disk-testing, data juggling (downsizing 1TB -> 3TB drives, etc.).  But again, it&#x27;s still &#x27;extra&#x27; cost, because they won&#x27;t (IMO) switch to solely online storage.<p>A question:<p>Are you providing tools to allow photographers to leverage their online storage?  E.g. Dropbox-like sharing with clients (even just contact sheets?), integration against online print services, store-fronts for image sales, etc.?<p>All that said, I&#x27;m interested in seeing your private beta though. I think this can work, one day. :)",1375972489

There are dedicated bike path lanes--fully separated from the roadways. Moreover, both cyclists and drivers alike follow the law.<p>Compared to New York City, where I live now, it&#x27;s the exact opposite. Bike lanes, in the few places they exist, are rarely anything more than a faded paint line on the road. Very few people (pedestrians, cyclists, or drivers) follow the rules of the road. Even as a twentysomething male--presumable predisposed to a higher degree of risk--riding a bike in NYC seems downright reckless.<p>A contributing factor to its dangerousness may be the city&#x27;s density; you have trucks at all hours dropping off newspaper deliveries, Amazon.com packages, FreshDirect orders, and so on. These may be some of the worst offenders--not necessarily because of the drivers but also how the vehicles lack visibility.<p>Some recent examples:

I have never heard or experienced anyone&#x27;s bike being impounded for chaining it up to a pole or post that is not officially &quot;a designated area to chain your bike.&quot;<p>> <i>In that kind of relationship it is longevity that counts - so the older, the better. It&#x27;s not uncommon to hear a bike coming up behind you with the mudguard rattling against the wheel. If anything, having a tatty, battered old bike affords more status as it attests to a long and lasting love.</i><p>Wrong. Cheap bikes are just that, cheap. That means that when your bike is stolen it&#x27;s not as painful. It also means that buying oneis cheap (I&#x27;m repeating myself, I know). If you&#x27;re going to get a bike for 20-50 EUR don&#x27;t expect it to be some kind of fancy machine. There&#x27;s no love affair with bicycles, it&#x27;s simply a matter of utility.<p>> <i>Of course, the cycle paths lend themselves to sauntering along in summer dresses in a way a death-defying, white-knuckle ride in rush-hour traffic does not. It is also partly because of this that people don&#x27;t need showers at work to be able to commute by bike - it&#x27;s a no-sweat experience.</i><p>I know PLENTY of people who sweat on their bikes and who constantly carry around deodorant. I sweat like hell on a bicycle because I own a mountain bike. Especially with a backpack on it&#x27;s a sweaty ride. Maybe it&#x27;s also because I _hate_ riding at a moderate pace. I&#x27;m constantly pushing my bike. Then again, I don&#x27;t ride my bike every single day.<p>> <i>The fact that everyone cycles, or knows someone who does, means that drivers are more sympathetic to cyclists when they have to share space on the roads. </i>
> <i>In turn, the cyclists are expected to respect and obey the rules of the road. You may be fined for riding recklessly, in the wrong place or jumping red lights.</i><p>Lol that is if the cops are around. People who drive cars are annoyed and afraid of cyclists because if anything were to happen, the driver would be at fault. When I was getting my driver&#x27;s license my instructor kept telling me that I should never let a cyclist pass if I have the right of way. Cyclists are arrogant in this regard, I&#x27;ve been on both sides of the table (road?) and I can tell you that when you&#x27;re on a bike, you know the cars are going to be careful around you because if anything happens, it&#x27;s usually their fault. Running red lights or engaging in risky maneuvers happens all the time.<p>What strikes me as odd is that this article doesn&#x27;t mention one of the most important reasons for cycling within cities: It&#x27;s not attractive to own a car. Owning a car is expensive. Gas is expensive. It&#x27;s almost impossible to park and maneuvering around the city center is very very difficult.<p>Have a look: <a href=""http://goo.gl/maps/wRRoZ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/maps/wRRoZ</a> .

The constant timing that you want to measure is part of the low-bound on the total time, any random OS process/timing glitch is going to <i>add</i> to that total time, but it will not somehow make the timespan you are interested in randomly run faster.

- type inference
- classes
- interfaces (sort of: traits)
- methods
- variables (var)
- immutable values (val)
- higher order functions 
- singletons
- functional programming: map, flatMap, reduce/fold, ...
- actors
- coroutines (I think there was a compiler plugin for that)
- implicits
- powerful type parameters
- Futures
- it even has a turing complete type system<p>That is good and bad. Good: you can probably find good use for every feature Scala has. Bad: On a sufficiently big project with one or more extra clever developers most probably every feature will be used and that will make it extra hard to understand for normal software developers that have to maintain it for long years after the original extra smart developer already left the company. See it a bit like that: On a hard to understand scale with 1 being easy to understand und 10 being extremely hard to understand Java projects can go from 1 to 6 and Scala projects can go from 1 to 10.<p>Personally I like simple languages more.

6178987,comment,6177389,6177389,2,0,eflowers,,,"Hello, I wrote this article. I can check one thing off my bucket list - an article of mine on the front page of HN (spot 28 as I write this).<p>Reading the stuff here in HN, I agree with almost everything said. My intent wasn&#x27;t to take a hard line tone, and in retrospect after getting tons and tons of feedback, I&#x27;d write it differently, but I&#x27;ll take this chance to clarify some things, both for myself and for others.<p>It is not written in a snarky or superior voice. It wasn&#x27;t a rant. If it sounded so, I apologize. It also comes off as a list of &quot;this is what a UX job title should be&quot;, which also wasn&#x27;t my intent. The simplest way to say what I was trying to convey is that if you label yourself as anything &quot;UX whatever&quot;, it is perceived as &quot;graphic artist for interfaces.&quot;<p>The article often seems to convey that UX &quot;owns&quot; all these different things, like it&#x27;s a panacea role above all others. It&#x27;s not.<p>It&#x27;s not something that I can clearly define. On the little 2-column lists, the things on the left were supposed to be things that I/we &quot;do&quot; in the sense of what often becomes the reality of the job, not in the sense of responsibilities that should be granted to use to be accountable for. And if that large list does become the reality of the job, it&#x27;s more than anyone can or should do. It was intended to be a &quot;these are some of the things a UX person might be responsible for.&quot; And yes there are some silly ones on there.<p>I don&#x27;t think UX is in a position of being a land-grab of everything that isn&#x27;t writing code because &quot;it&#x27;s what we do&quot;, but it&#x27;s more of a &quot;this is what we are often doing&quot; list. And some of the things on it should be owned by other discrete jobs careers. The motivation to write the article came from being in role after role where that list on the left was the list of things I was inadvertently responsible for, but &quot;graphic designer for interfaces&quot; is all that is seen by others, which isn&#x27;t fair to UX people who don&#x27;t focus on interface design, and isn&#x27;t fair to interface designers who don&#x27;t focus on the UX work that isn&#x27;t based on UI or visuals or interaction.<p>It&#x27;s sort of just a response to the introductory conversation I have the first few weeks at any job. &quot;What is your role here?&quot; &quot;Well I&#x27;m the new UX guy.&quot; &quot;Great! Our stuff is ugly, you&#x27;re gonna give it that sexy look and feel?&quot; &quot;Yes, but I am going to be doing other things that sort of result in that look and feel you want&quot; And then when I list off some of those things, typically the other person looks at me like I&#x27;m a lunatic and we both end up confused on what I&#x27;m actually supposed to be doing, and the disappointment that I&#x27;m not just there for look and feel.<p>But for sure, the article is not meant to be a land-grab or king of the hill situation of &quot;UX OWNS EVERYTHING&quot;, but just a glimpse into the terrible ambiguity of what UX is and how the very common initial perception of &quot;graphic designer for interfaces&quot; makes it even more unclear.",1375971125

As a follow-up to One Direction&#x27;s internationally successful debut album, Up All Night (2011), Take Me Home was written in groups and has an average of just under five songwriters per track. Largely recorded and composed in Sweden during 2012, Savan Kotecha, Rami Yacoub and Carl Falk, who composed One Direction&#x27;s hits, &quot;What Makes You Beautiful&quot; and &quot;One Thing&quot;, spent six months in Stockholm developing songs for the album, and were able to shape melodies around the members&#x27; tones.
The album&#x27;s songs are characterised by metronomic pop, vocal harmonies, hand claps, prominent electric guitar riffs, bright synthesizers, the pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune, a homogeneous sound and message, and rotations of lead vocals. The members&#x27; voices are presented individually on the record, and its lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, commitment, jealousy, and longing for past significant others. Take Me Home garnered mixed reviews from music critics. There was praise for its quality of production, while criticism hinged on its generic, rushed nature.",1375970534

6178931,comment,6176222,6177470,1,0,hga,,,"It was:<p>Prior to a fairly recent overhaul, the technology licencing office (rough quote from memory from <i>Tech Talk</i>, the Institute&#x27;s official newsletter): &quot;focused on the details of licencing vs. doing a lot of licences&quot; and averaged a little over 1 per year (!!!).  Given that I know 3 of those, the LMI Lisp Machine licenses and the same plus Macsyma to Symbolics....<p>They notoriously screwed up the 3D core memory patent ($40 million lump sum to IBM vs. the offered 1 cent per core) and a synthetic penicillin patent.  Either could have paid for a complete replacement of the entire campus.  I very strongly suspect these weren&#x27;t the only screwups, and e.g. Symbolics scammed an <i>exclusive</i> license to Macsyma mostly to keep it out of other people&#x27;s hands, one reason Wolfram was able to beat it sort of starting from scratch.<p>Back then, when the prime rate was over 20%, and inflation was over 15%, MIT was getting a much lower return on its endowment.  I want to say 4%, but I&#x27;m not sure.  MIT does a lot better now, but that is also recent.<p>It got its charter just as the Civil War started, and set up operations just after.  So as noted it doesn&#x27;t have the 2 centuries or more of additional compounding alumni donations the famous Ivies have.<p>Not sure when it started, and it was again fixed only fairly recently, but the alumni magazine, <i>Technology Review</i>, was dedicated to telling most of the alumni that what they were doing was evil.  And again by then the Institute apparently had convinced a lot of alumni that it couldn&#x27;t be trusted with unrestricted gifts.  In its favor it never tried a Princeton Woodrow Wilson Center type donation theft, then again I don&#x27;t know of any other top school so brazen.<p>Ah, it also was wretched, not interested or perhaps in part stymied by city government (which hates Harvard with a passion, and MIT gets some of the blowback) in making money off of local real estate.  When I showed up the Kendal Square area had that bombed out sort of look, in part due to NASA deciding after JFK&#x27;s assassination and LBJ becoming President that, oh, on second though Texas is where we should build our space center.  There was almost no housing, let alone vaguely affordable and safe, to be found close to campus.  I&#x27;m sure that bit of MIT&#x27;s studied indifference to student welfare didn&#x27;t escape some of the alumni who were the sort to later make a fortune.<p>Bottom line: not a lot of money to grant to students, and a <i>total</i> focus on needs based aid.  And, hmmm, rather obviously students like me who were crushed by the intersection of the financial aid policies of MIT and their parents would never be in a position to donate a lot of money, and not inclined to donate much of what we do have.",1375970487

Most major (and minor apps) are already retooled for iOS 7 (or are in progress) -- so something not working on iOS7 is often obvious to the developer, but he/she can&#x27;t release an iOS 7 update until iOS7 is released. So bug feedback is pointless from beta iOS7 because those bugs might already be completely fixed and ready for release.",1375970485

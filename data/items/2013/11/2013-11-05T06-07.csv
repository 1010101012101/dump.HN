But in fact the libertarian in me loves it - if implemented, it removes the need for vast swaths of government. If everyone is guaranteed a basic income, you no longer need vast systems to manage all the means-tested programs. No social security<p>Social security isn&#x27;t means-tested, its contribution-based (the only way that it even approximates being means-tested is that SS income is subject to income tax if your total income is above a certain level.)<p>> no retirement programs<p>Retirement programs other than Social Security aren&#x27;t safety net programs, so inasmuch as there is a need for them <i>without</i> basic income income, it doesn&#x27;t go away with basic income.",1383634782

Might as well hold up a flag with &quot;entrenched cultural views of the establishment&quot; written on it.  This doesn&#x27;t aid the counter-argument against the notion that the F-22 was designed to fight a &quot;defunct Soviet threat.&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s face it.  Japan and China are feinting, in the way that nations do silly things that ultimately get settled through war, at some random rocks with natural gas nearby while only 10m gets spent on focus fusion development and 4trillion with a &#x27;T&#x27; flows through the fossil fuels industry every year.  Meanwhile we seem to still fight wars on the back of outright lies (&quot;yellow cake?&quot;) and carry out dragnet surveillance to figure out Angela Merkel&#x27;s plot to bomb the white house.  Let&#x27;s just say I have some problems with the overall priorities in this picture.<p>On the other hand, assuming defense(?) actually is important, we have carriers that cost billions and are complete sitting ducks to anti-ship ballistic missiles like that China has developed, which have stealthy, guided warheads apparently.  Good thing we have Aegis cruisers guarding them to intercept any wayward missile bodies that might also impact the carriers.  Military spending is worse than healthcare.gov.",1383634756

6673614,comment,6671371,6671371,1,0,notduncansmith,,,"While I agree with most of the points the author makes in this article, I disagree with the ultimate thesis.<p>Snapchat offers what?  <i></i>Engagement<i></i><p>So how do you monetize that?  <i></i>Get users to engage with brands<i></i><p>Allow me to elaborate. Twitter&#x27;s Amplify partnership program is a brilliant example of the amount brands are willing to pay to engage with customers (both existing and potential). Twitter used to be in a unique position to offer that engagement too: with huge penetration, easy integration into existing media (putting a hashtag in the corner of a TV broadcast, for instance), and an incredibly low-friction engagement process.  Twitter made it easy for a brand to create a sea of voices engaging with a brand. I believe Snapchat is now in a position to make a similar offer.<p>Before I go on, I&#x27;d like to pose a question: how many people read event-centric tweets after an event? Aside from journalists reporting on said event looking for memorable tweets, my guess is not many. Hell, most people barely pay attention to the stream during these events. At most, you have a tweet that&#x27;s at the top of a feed for a few seconds before being quickly pushed down by a dozen more, <i></i>never to be read again<i></i>. I&#x27;m sure by now you&#x27;re connecting the dots: Snapchat offers a similar service in that respect.<p>The thing is, there&#x27;s a major core difference between these two.  Twitter is a public forum, and Snapchat is strictly peer-to-peer communication. This gives Snapchat a unique offering, in that it allows brands to communicate one-on-one with customers.<p>Imagine, if you will, a broadcast of The Walking Dead (I use them as an example for two reasons: 1.) I&#x27;m a huge fan, and 2.) They&#x27;re big on the second-screen experience so this seems plausible). As part of your second-screen experience, one might find a stream of picture responses to various moments in the episode. Major character dies, suddenly the stream is full of shocked faces (maybe some rage faces or big goofy grins, depending on who).  Now imagine this stream is powered by Snapchat.<p>This is already possible with Twitter, to a degree, but with Snapchat there&#x27;s less inhibition which will drive greater participation and greater engagement. Not only that, but Snapchat would also allow TWD to engage back with the user on a personal level- maybe respond with a snap that contains a marketing call-to-action (&quot;Want more scares?  Check out the exclusive behind-the-scenes footage online&quot;), or just responds with a zombified version of the image you sent in (how cool would that be?).<p>I&#x27;m sure there are many more awesome use cases than what I just stated, but I think this example speaks to the fact that Snapchat can be a real force for engagement without requiring brands to spam the hell out of the platform&#x27;s users.  This is where Snapchat outperforms against any other social product when it comes to driving brand engagement: because the users are so fanatically engaging with the product already, <i></i>brands don&#x27;t need to spam<i></i>.  They can just interact with the users in a meaningful or entertaining way - and I don&#x27;t mean this &quot;Get a coupon that you have 10 seconds to screenshot&quot; bullshit, or &quot;Let brands send snapchats that last forever&quot; or any shit like that.  Just give the users a fun way to interact with your brand, and the loyalty (and purchases) will come.<p>So, here&#x27;s what I would do, if I were to monetize Snapchat:<p>- $20/yr developer program<p>- Free API access for up to 2,000 snaps sent/received per month<p>- Pay-as-you-go model: $XX for every additional 10,000 additional snaps<p>- Hashtag support (maybe)<p>- Analytics<p>- Offer consulting at a premium to help brands effectively leverage Snapchat<p>Notice the generous pricing structure.  I think one thing that Snapchat can cash in on is the uniqueness of its platform, and the eagerness of the hacker community at large to build on top of it.  I want you to recall the modest success of App.net, which doesn&#x27;t have nearly the engagement metrics or penetration that Snapchat currently enjoys.  I for one have several small projects I&#x27;d like to build on the Snapchat platform, and would be more than happy to pay a modest premium for the opportunity. The pay-as-you-go structure keeps your hackers happy (I doubt anyone would pay $100+ for toy projects), and also maximizes revenue from larger brand campaigns.<p>In conclusion, I think the assertion that Snapchat &quot;has no intrinsic value&quot; is complete bollocks.",1383634523

These Licenses could be used for existing or future Patents, by both Individuals and Legal Entities. The Key here is that the Community votes to choose the Rights, Capabilities, and Limitations of each Open License.<p>2. A Community Driven approach towards assisting with the actual Patenting of Submitted Technology (or assisting with the Cost / Filing) as provided by, and voted on by the Tech Community. Patents would be granted to the Submitter of the Innovation (they get credit), and then assigned an Open Patent License (everyone can use the Technology freely). Key here being that the Community votes to choose what they want to see Patented.<p>This is my vision to stop Patent Trolling independently of the Legal System (which works too slow). Crowdsource the Innovations and Patent them with an Open License, thus opening the technology to everyone in the future. We can&#x27;t stop the Trolling of Existing Patents, but if we draw a line in the sand today, we can stop the Trolling of Future Patents by Patenting the Innovations first and opening them to the Community for Free Use.<p>While this is a noble cause (IMO anyway), I am still at the point of my life where I need to work 8+ hours a day to pay the Bills, and thus I&#x27;m not at the point of starting this Non-Profit (though I do own the Domains, and I have created a Website, as well as considered an Indiegogo Campaign)",1383632633

6673484,comment,6673106,6673434,10,0,ReidZB,,,"You&#x27;re right --- had they used something other than ECB mode. For example, if they used CBC mode with a proper IV, <i>assuming the key is not stolen or compromised</i>, the passwords would be quite secure.<p>The issue becomes verifying the passwords, then: supposing you have a CBC mode oracle, like a HSM, how can you verify two passwords are the same? (This is probably the reason they chose ECB mode in the first place.) In fact, if you allow the user to test if two ciphertexts represent the same plaintext --- and nothing else --- you still break the very definition of secure encryption, namely that a secure encryption scheme should have, as one popular definition, indistinguishable ciphertexts (usually under a chosen-plaintext attack).<p>So you have to develop some new way to measure security for the scheme, or perhaps somehow measure the damage that an equality oracle can inflict upon an IND-CPA secure scheme. The notion of indistinguishable ciphertexts roughly reflects the inability of an attacker to reliably learn <i>any</i> function of the plaintext from the ciphertext. Throwing that idea out the window seems unwise, since it&#x27;s such an elegant idea. So, anyway, you&#x27;re off in uncharted waters, not a good place to be if you&#x27;re securing users&#x27; passwords.<p>All of that is relatively complex, though, so just let me know if I need to elaborate on some idea more.

For example that unprotected Western Australian coastline that you pointed to is substantially covered if you take into the account the existence of bare bases such as Curtain.<p>No, range is more of an issue because Australia&#x27;s current defensive posture is to try to stop any potential enemy in what is called the air-sea gap. That means interdiction at long distances off the coastline. With aircraft carriers being financially out of reach that leaves long range aircraft as the only viable option. The f-35 is going to be a disaster for Australia&#x27;s defence, we can only hope that the US honours the goodwill that the purchase of those systems was supposed to procure. Of course, they&#x27;re going to be flying the same crappy airframes, so meh.<p>Just one last thing in defence of the JSF though. It&#x27;s unique capabilities in takeoff / landing make cheaper aircraft carriers a real possibility. Of course Australia hasn&#x27;t actually tried to procure any such thing so it&#x27;s only a theoretical, but if tensions were to start to mount in Asia that is something that could be rectified relatively quickly...",1383631325

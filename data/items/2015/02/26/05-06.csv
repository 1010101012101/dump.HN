As you mentioned, for practical math, you can often validate your answer against the initial assumptions. This is true for statistical testing too, as it typically relies on many theoretical assumptions. So what you can do in practice is propose a different set of assumptions, perform the hypothesis test in a manner that follows those new assumptions, and see if you obtain a similar result. Typically, for any given hypothesis that you want to test, there are several possible methods for performing that test, so you can redo your test many times. This is one type of robustness checking, which includes many other things as well (e.g. running your test over subsamples or resamples of the data, checking for sensitivity to outliers, etc). Good statisticians generally like to do lots and lots of robustness checking.",1424930281

This is a rehash of their &quot;Against Intellectual Monopoly&quot; book, and they do the same  mischaracterizing of other research, mis-portraying of actual events and claiming outright falsehoods.<p>Case in point, the myth that Watt&#x27;s patents held up steam development (which you too repeated): <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6865980"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6865980</a>. What&#x27;s really egregious is they refused to admit the truth when called out on it.<p>Another comment pointing more falsehoods on their part:\n<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7890441"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7890441</a><p>And before anyone else mentions it, the &quot;Wright patent held up US aircraft industry&quot; thing is a myth too:\n<a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2355673"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2355673</a><p>The startup / patents paper indeed is interesting, thanks, but the results are more nuanced than the quote you selected: patents <i>do</i> help startups with financing and making successful exits, but they cannot be leveraged effectively because enforcing them is more <i>expensive</i>. That is something that can be fixed if people focused on it rather than the &quot;patent troll&quot; bogeyman.<p>The &quot;Cumulative Innovation&quot; paper is new to me, but a quick glance suggests some problems with it right away:<p>1. They derive a model to evaluate their claims, and unless backed up by solid empirical proof, this can be made to support arbitrary hypotheses (see this exchange on an unrelated field: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9082932"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9082932</a>).<p>2. Their final data set is very small (1200 or so patents out of millions) and highly biased, since they relate only to litigated patents, and even then, on those they deem to be the &quot;stronger&quot; ones. Indeed, they admit that most other patents being invalidated has no effect whatsoever on their metric for downstream innovation. Even if valid, it is impossible to generalize these results to all patents as a whole.<p>On the other hand, there are many, many papers that point out the benefits of patent systems that you may not have considered. Yet another comment of mine mentioning some:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8155043"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8155043</a><p>The number of links to my own comments should give you a hint as to how often I debate this topic on HN :-) As usual, I&#x27;ll wrap up by saying it&#x27;s a complex and nuanced topic, and point to a meta-study that looks at a large number of other studies that explore both the pros and cons of current patent systems:<p>&quot;Recent Research on the Economics of Patents&quot; - Bronwyn H.

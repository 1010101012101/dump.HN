Browsers and people are not the only thing reading the web - there are crawlers and other tools doing this, that and the other.

Mainly I am venting my frustration at the lack of a dedicated developer to maintain the project, especially after I've seen so many success stories.<p>wrt AGPL: In orbited's case -- b/c it is a socket proxy -- the AGPL would really have <i>no impact</i> whatsoever on users. No one would be linking any of their code in-process, and so there would really be no requirement for them to AGPL any of their custom back-end logic. Besides, I don't really believe in trying to force users down a particular path. My hope is always that freedom and choice helps build trust with your user base, which ultimately results in the healthiest community.<p>Yet, when I started Orbited 3-4 years ago, I never intended to be married to the project forever. My hope has always been that some people/projects/companies that are depending on the Orbited would be willing to commit substantial engineering resources to fix bugs and implement new features, and from those contributions some new core committers would emerge. Unfortunately, my work still accounts for about 95% of the 0.7.x branch which is the last stable release.<p>I feel like Orbited is far behind, considering I haven't been involved in a release in about 2 years, and no one else has really stepped up. I am always shocked, truthfully, when I hear success stories and see people building applications with it still. The code base has remained unchanged through about 10 browser releases.",1287052673

Greasemonkey is marginal at best. What other things do you have in mind?<p>>Secondly - either you are a programmer or not. I can't actually tell from your article if you want to be or not. However if you want to be a good programmer then you need to learn other languages - you might not be an expert in those other languages but being able to navigate your way round them - it is good for your programmers brain.<p>I've learned plenty of languages and do appreciate some of the points of Javascript. I just don't see why everyone seems to defend it as the one-true-language for the client side. For everything else people make plenty of diverse choices yet somehow on the one platform that for historical reasons is stuck with a single language saying you'd rather use another implies somehow that you don't get it.<p>>And thirdly - Javascript is actually a real cool language masquerading as a very dull mainstream one. I resisted doing too much in it for years but as I needed to do more and more I found out that its very powerful and flexible. Also if you use something like jquery you get a lot of Ruby style bits and pieces.<p>I am using jQuery and it does have some goodies. The point isn't that with effort I couldn't make myself more comfortable with it. The point is that I don't see much that Javascript gives me that Ruby doesn't. So the fact I am forced to use Javascript is a net-negative for me.<p>>If all you have is a hammer then every thing looks like a nail. Ruby might be a pretty good language - but there is a reason there are so many other languages and its not because all the other people are idiots who weren't smart enough to come up with Ruby.<p>Certainly. And I do use other languages. The reason I'd like to be able to use Ruby for both codebases is that that would allow me to do interesting stuff I can't right now.<p>In fact the same criticism can be made of Javascript, that because it's the only hammer available everything looks like a nail.

I know that you can blame a lot of things on this particular political entity (the War in Yugoslavia 100 years later being just one example), but it also did a lot of things very well. Actually, come to think of it, large swaths of the European Union are modeled on the Austro-Hungarian example, but those in Brussels are just too scared to admit it.",1287051539

However, I haven't done any battery life tweaking (powertop etc), and it probably doesn't help that I have the higher-res 1920x1080 screen (which I assume chews up battery, but I wouldn't give up for anything).<p>However, I got the backup battery as well (it plugs in over the top of the normal battery) - it pretty much triples the battery life.  It's heavy as hell, but if you're going to be in one place for a while (at home, on a long-haul flight, etc) that's not a problem.",1287051220

In this instance we have a (broadly) common language that runs on Windows, Mac, Linux and then some - thats pretty amazing.<p><language instead of a bytecode interpreter\nIt would be trite to point out that what you have ""under the hood"" in JavaScript implementations is a pretty good JIT bytecode interpreter. JavaScript code represents a fully portable version of the code that will run in the user chosen browser on the user chosen hardware platform.<p><properly iterate an array\nJust picking on of your points here - It may be that you can solve each obstacle just the once and retain that solution into the future. As an example try <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global...</a> for how to add ""forEach"" functionality to an array - an array which (of course) can contain objects of any type.

I can't actually tell from your article if you want to be or not. However if you want to be a good programmer then you need to learn other languages - you might not be an expert in those other languages but being able to navigate your way round them - it is good for your programmers brain.

</code></pre>
This is a very insightful observation. I loved mathematics till high school (in India), and solving problems was real fun (with a good understanding of what it was all about). Then i started my engineering (again in India), and was completely put off by the insanity of solving only problems without much thinking and appreciating the beauty and underlying principles.<p>I was also startled a bit by the following statement in the article:<p><pre><code>  Math homework in India consists of math problems that students work through, as opposed to the United States,
  where homework is heavy on reading about math topics in a textbook.
</code></pre>
To me, it's almost impossible to think of basic math without problem solving. May be it's only me, but the real 'fun' is not complete without it, and i daresay it is not the greatest strategy of attracting inquisitive kids to it.<p><pre><code>  For some reason, American kids seem to be willing to put in the work with athletics,

For example, I'm originally from Eastern Europe, one of the places where mathematical talent is supposedly valued highly, but I can tell you it absolutely isn't. I even went to a special math/programming-oriented high-school, and even there the cool kids were the ones that didn't seem to care about math at all, but instead had the looks/fashion/sports abilities.<p>Also, the comparison between American kids and Indian kids <i>in the US</i> is not quite fair, since these Indians are a highly biased sample of the true Indian population.<p>So the difference must be in something else, too.

From my experience, the Indian education system is heavily geared towards attaining high <i>average</i> output. The education system in the US is much more laissez-fair in this regard. It allows students to adjust to their needs and capabilities. Neither system is perfect. In the Indian system, the exceptionally smart students get shafted because they are bogged down by the rigid and usually rote curriculum. For the average person, arithmetic is sufficient but for an advanced major, giving them problems is crushing (I speak from personal experience). The complete lack of intellectual stimulus is very counterproductive. On the other hand, in the US system, a large portion of the students slack off and fail to use their opportunities. Going through the US education system has put me years ahead of where I would have been if I was still in India but along the way, I have seen many students miss out and just sit on the sidelines. [1]<p>This startup can be immensely helpful but please, don't see this as a begin and end all for mathematics education. If a student is capably of grasping the axiomatic principles of mathematics, such a learning path is infinitely preferable to the do-lots-of-problems method.

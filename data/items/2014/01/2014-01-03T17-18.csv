7006763,comment,7001747,7005974,1,0,bollockitis,,,"> 1: Hmm, chronically high insulin levels is caused by chronically eating too much. Beef spikes insulin just as much as table sugar (<a href""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/66/5/1264.full.pdf#page=1&.."" rel""nofollo"">http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/66/5/1264.full.pdf#page=1&...</a>). So I would say the problem of &quot;chronically high insulin levels&quot; is a problem of eating too much food, not too much sugar.<p>Yes, beef does have a high insulin response, but when total consumption is taken into account, and satiety, eating beef will have a lesser effect than eating jellybeans. Look at the insulin scores in the publication you cited. Those with the highest scores, as a group, are snacks and confectionaries, foods that are commonly eaten in Western countries. Some of the worst offenders in the groups tested are: beans, potatoes, white bread, jellybeans, etc. -- carbohydrates.<p>> 2: This is a hugely interesting area of thinking for me. Which fat though? White or brown adipose tissue? Brown fat is darker in colour due to it&#x27;s huge cellular density of mitochondria when compared to white adipose tissue. It&#x27;s essential fat-buringing fat, and plays a role in regulating temperature. It basically burns fat to warm us up when we&#x27;re cold. This is why Michael Phelps can eat 10 million calories a day. 6 hours a day in water requires allocating a LOT of calories to maintain core body temp. We have learned SO much about fat tissue recently, but I don&#x27;t think we have all the answers yet.<p>In this case we&#x27;re talking almost exclusively about excess visceral fat, though the role of other fats in obesity and disease is, as you said, not fully known.<p>>> Let’s assume two things for the sake of argument. the sugar in A’s diet causes A to become insulin resistant. And second, insulin works to put fat in fat tissue.\n> I would say both assumptions are fallacious. Eating @ TDEE means 100% of the food energy is used up, and fat cannot be made from nothing.<p>True, but activity level must be taken into account. Fat can&#x27;t be made from nothing, but the patient could reduce his overall activity level as he becomes fatter, which would make excess calories available for storage as fat. In other words, we could have causality backwards: being lazy doesn&#x27;t necessarily make you fat, but becoming fat could certainly make you lazy.<p>> Also, the &quot;insulin works to put fat in fat tissue&quot; is misleading at best and completely wrong at worst, depending on how you interpret it. Insulin works to move nutrients into cells. More insulin in the blood is a signal there is food calories available, so insulin also stops fat cells from releasing their fat. This makes total sense; why dip into your savings when you just got a fist full of cash?<p>If insulin stops fat cells from releasing fat, then wouldn&#x27;t it make sense to keep insulin levels as low possible? That means reducing carbohydrate and protein intake, and increasing dietary fat consumption to compensate: in short, a low-carb, high-fat diet.<p>> The point where your body transitions towards fat storage is the point where your energy intake exceed energy expenditure; again just simply eating less solves this.<p>Does it though? Obese people have much higher concentrations of circulating leptin than the general population, and they can become leptin resistant. What happens if we tell these people to eat less, and move more? Chances are, they&#x27;re going to become very hungry. I would argue that eating less isn&#x27;t enough. They need to eat less insulinogenic foods, and compensate by increasing dietary fat to satiety.<p>> My statements are all for average healthy people. I totally agree metabolic-syndromes like diabetes should be treated differently. But the VAST majority of people are fat because they sustain consuming more energy than they use. The micro-variables like how stressed you are (and therefor how much cortisol hormone is present) matter, but nothing gets diet-induced hormones working as they should better (in healthy people) by just eating food-energy (whatever the macros) to match your activity over the long run.<p>Fair enough. That&#x27;s the commonly held belief at least, but I disagree. I think we have an incomplete picture. However, I believe in the scientific method, so I&#x27;d really like to see clinical trials (not epidemiological studies) to fully test the hormone theory. As I said earlier, if it&#x27;s wrong, then we haven&#x27;t lost anything, and we&#x27;ve learned more about the role hormones play in obesity. If it&#x27;s correct, then the impact on nutrition and obesity will be enormous. It&#x27;s worth looking into.",1388770971

This is why they attempt it -- <i>risk reduction</i>.  I&#x27;m aware of proposed agreements that, for a few thousand dollars in a one time payout, cause the formerly employed to abrogate supposedly <i>all</i> rights to sue, on any basis.<p>Granted, that may not be entirely enforceable.  But it&#x27;s another considerable hurdle to surmount if and as you feel and determine yourself to have been wronged.  First, you have to attempt to break out of the binding arbitration -- if any -- that such contracts impose.<p>I&#x27;d rather have a few expensive suits and management sweat a bit more, if nothing else, in such circumstances.  Tie them up with more paperwork and tracking.  If nothing else, it helps to keep them on their toes and perhaps less likely to screw the next guy.<p>And yes, again, in such circumstances, somewhat of that perspective <i>is prescribed</i>.

(And, in that regard, <i>documentation</i> is your friend.  Keep printouts of relevant material.  If you feel things are going south, keep a separate, datestamped journal documenting specific events in detail.)<p>If you have assets on hand, you will feel less motivated to take such a payout, especially not one that is rushed upon you with a very limited window for consideration.  You may also decide it is worth the money to at least consult with an attorney (that you are paying by the hour, not on contingency) for an independent and professional opinion.<p>Many people on HN are at least ostensibly &quot;professionals&quot;.  A few thousand, for a regular, full-time employee, should not make or break you.

You want me to hire someone who if I have a disagreement with is now going to tell her side and her side only on this email newsletter which she has priority access too and essentially put me on blast?<p>Will put his previous employer on blast without any quotes from them or getting their side on it. Does Will feel better about it? absolutely. Is this going to help his chances of getting a job with a new employer. Not a chance. Maybe this will help him sell his books?<p>| Mind you, I’m not looking to disparage Byliner.<p>This is the equivalent of saying, No offense but.. or I&#x27;m not a racist, but...",1388769305

If you perturb the ship by tilting it slightly starboard or port, and then remove the perturbation, it will return to sitting upright. Most ships are designed to have a stable equilibrium along the axis of the keel. Simply removing any perturbation will return the ship to the upright equilibrium.<p>Now, say you perturb the ship by applying a deflection to the rudder, tending to turn the ship to a new heading. When you remove the perturbation, the ship will straighten itself out, and stop turning, but will not return to its original heading. While most ships are designed to self-equillibriate to traveling straight, each possible heading is itself a stable equilibrium.<p>The &quot;equality is treating people as equals&quot; viewpoint assumes that the world behaves like the first case. You remove the discriminatory force, and you can assume that society will return itself to an upright equilibrium. But that&#x27;s just an assumption. The world could very well behave like the second case. Even if you remove the discriminatory force, you can still be headed in the wrong direction!<p>The experience of at least two professions suggests that the world behaves more like the second case. In the 1950&#x27;s and 1960&#x27;s, there was extreme discrimination against women in medicine and law. In the 1970&#x27;s through 1990&#x27;s, both medical schools and law schools took affirmative measures to increase enrollment of women. And it was a smashing success: <a href""http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/hua_hsu/assets_c/2012/12/cohen_doctorlawyer-thumb-615x438-107918.pn"" rel""nofollo"">http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/hua_hsu/assets_c...</a>.<p>The key takeaway, though, is that the affirmative action moved the society to a new stable equilibrium. Today, there is no real advantage to being a woman when applying to medical school or law school. But the enrollment is stable because the new situation is self-perpetuating.",1388768905

I bet a lot of people will not even find out there is such a filter. \nSecondly, with such ambiguous categories like &quot;obscene&quot; and &quot;extremist&quot; content that have proven to block sites that contain information on LGTB issues and helplines for abuse people get trapped in filter bubbles. People are treated like mindless zombies and it&#x27;s a self fulfilling prophecy because without alternative opinions or a wide and diverse specter of information people do indeed become mindless zombies. \nFinally, this is the most lazy and stupid solution to the problem - does the state not want it&#x27;s people to be able/learn to deal with various information that&#x27;s out there (because remember - if you can&#x27;t see it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not there) and to think critically?

The likely consequence is that you might need to eat more protein to replace the amino acids scavenged for this purpose.<p>In practice, you cannot contract a dietary deficiency disease from eliminating sugar unless you have a genetic defect affecting liver function.  Even if you also eat no protein, your body will self-cannibalize muscle tissue to keep the brain alive.<p>It appears as though the evolutionary pressures on humans have produced support for two different energy metabolisms.  In times of feast, where sugars and starches are consumed in excess, the body operates on glucose and glycogen, and stores fat.  In times of famine, the body operates on ketones produced from its own body fat, and the brain operates on a combination of lactic acid and sugars scavenged from the body&#x27;s protein stores.<p>The potential consequence of this is that if you ever do start eating significant quantities of sugar, your body will chemically signal that famine is over, and prioritize the restoration of your body fat stores.  In other words, you can never go off the diet if you want to maintain your weight, as your body will want to turn every last scrap of excess sugar into fat as fast as possible.<p>This seriously sucks, because the brain is hardwired to love sweeter foods--foods that surround us constantly.  It&#x27;s like Lou Wu from Niven&#x27;s Ringworld resisting the urge to eat the magic sweet potato that turns Pak breeders into protectors.

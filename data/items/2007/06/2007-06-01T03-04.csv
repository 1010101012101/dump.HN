The gist of it is that the groups who can sue for discrimination have to be politically disadvantaged.  If straights wanted to force GayFriendMatch.com to match straight couples, a law could easily be passed.<p>I sort of wonder what the real aim here is.  It seems like the service is being targeted because of the religious beliefs of the founder as much as the product itself.  ",1180669738

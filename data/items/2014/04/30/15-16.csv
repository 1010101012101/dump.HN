If we go back to the analogy, fairy tale / fantasy troll would usually fix the bridge and demand toll from anyone passing by. While clearly racketeering, the troll can argue that he added value to the bridge. Same goes for patent trolls. Some are complete parasites, and there are patent trolls which produce some stuff, while being racketeers at the same time.<p>The common logic here is that racketeers want money for something they didn&#x27;t really do (the troll didn&#x27;t build the bridge, some company didn&#x27;t really make or invent the tech that they demand money for and so on).",1398873546

7674172,comment,7659524,7671296,1,0,aetherson,,,"I don&#x27;t think that insurance is a good cost to include in the comparison.  In a driverless car world, we imagine that insurance costs will be pretty much a constant per mile traveled -- there are no better or worse drivers -- and probably lower than they are now.  And you&#x27;ll have to pay for them (directly or indirectly) whether you rent or own.<p>If your costs for the second car are more than $1k in just registration and servicing are more than about $500 a year, that, first, suggests that you&#x27;re not very cost-conscious today.  My car&#x27;s cost service and registration fees are much less than that.  Second, service costs also are basically a per-mile fee -- your car&#x27;s quality doesn&#x27;t degrade when it sits in your garage, and you&#x27;ll pay the service costs of a vehicle you use directly or otherwise.<p>You didn&#x27;t mention fuel, but of course again that&#x27;s essentially per-mile, and costs what it costs regardless of the car ownership model.<p>That leaves registration, which is a small cost, but would be shared in a shared ownership model.<p>Now, of course, the actual major expense is the cost of buying the car in the first place, defrayed over the lifetime of the car, minus any price you get for selling it.  The big advantage of a car-share service would be that you could share that cost with others.  If a driverless car costs $50,000 (and we have no idea how much they would cost), and you use it for only 5 years, then sell it for $20,000, you get $6k per year.  In a shared ownership model where you share it with three other people, and the company that you&#x27;re going through makes about 10% gross margin, you&#x27;re looking at $2.2k instead of $6k, so yay, savings of $3.8k per year.  That&#x27;s a lot of money.<p>If, on the other hand, a driverless car costs $30k and can be sold after five years for $15k, then it&#x27;s $3k per year to own and $1.1k per year to rent, you&#x27;re saving $1.9k instead $3.8k, and that&#x27;s still not peanuts, but you suggest that right now you spend more than that for a not-very-highly-used second car.  The advantages of owning are considerable.",1398873462

Khan Academy works well for my two younger children.<p>AFTER EDIT: I&#x27;ll mention some of the changes that Colin kindly asked for news about. As a lot of Hacker News regulars know, several of the Khan Academy developers regularly visit Hacker News. Some of those developers have interacted specifically with me both on-forum and by private email to ask sincere, action-oriented questions about how Khan Academy mathematics lessons can improve. One suggestion I made a couple years ago was for Khan Academy to arrange its lessons in a &quot;knowledge space&quot; like the competing commerical online program ALEKS,[1] which I like very well for my homeschooled children. Another suggestion I made was to make sure that the online work was more of the nature of &quot;problems&quot; rather than &quot;exercises,&quot;[2] and the Khan Academy developers have come up with some very innovative online mathematics problems to ensure that learners don&#x27;t merely passively watch videos but actively learn new mathematics.<p>Simply put, I think Khan Academy is iterating successfully. In many respects, I am in direct competition with Khan Academy as a mathematics instructor who teaches in-person lessons for which fees are billed, but I am happy to let my clients know about the existence of Khan Academy, happy to see my own children use it for a lot of their own mathematics learning, and happy to see schools adopt Khan Academy as they &quot;flip the classroom.&quot; I am very much a both-and kind of guy when it comes to mathematics instruction--I like to mix and match a lot of programs--but I think Khan Academy has a useful place in the mix.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.aleks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aleks.com/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.epsiloncamp.org/ProblemsversusExercises.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epsiloncamp.org/ProblemsversusExercises.php</a>",1398873402

7674166,comment,7673353,7673353,17,0,dragonwriter,,,"DHH either is being disingenuous, or <i>badly</i> misunderstands unit testing.<p>He opens with this:<p>> The classical definition of a unit test in TDD lore is one that doesn&#x27;t touch the database. Or any other external interface, like the file system. The justification is largely one of speed. Connecting to external services like that would be too slow to get the feedback cycle you need.<p>No, &quot;unit tests&quot; in TDD -- and long before, TDD didn&#x27;t change anything about the definition -- are tests that, to the extent practical, test <i>all</i> and <i>only</i> the functionality of the specific <i>unit</i> under test, hence the name. <i>That&#x27;s</i> the reason why external interactions are minimized in proper unit tests (whether or not TDD is being practiced). TDD <i>observes</i> that such tests are generally fast, and builds the red-green-refactor cycle around that fact, but <i>speed</i> isn&#x27;t the justification for the isolation,  isolation of the functionality being tested from other functionality is the <i>point</i> of unit testing (which is designed not only to identify errors, but to <i>pinpoint</i> them.)",1398873378

7674152,comment,7673529,7673706,30,0,modernerd,,,"From an end-user perspective:<p>1. It&#x27;s easier to use than WordPress, Drupal etc. That&#x27;s because it does much less than those platforms on purpose. The WordPress admin area has become a scary place for new users, particularly once they start to add plugins that litter the admin menu with extra entries.<p>2. The admin area is fast. Moving around feels slick – it is a desktop-like experience; hitting Command+S will save the draft you&#x27;re working on, for example, rather than bringing up your browser&#x27;s “Save Page As...” prompt. The Markdown preview is as-you-type, and they use the screen estate very well. It&#x27;s a comfortable environment to write long posts in, and it hasn&#x27;t been tacked on as an afterthought, like WordPress&#x27; full-screen editing mode.<p>3. The organisation behind Ghost, the &quot;Ghost Foundation&quot; is a non-profit. It doesn&#x27;t have investors or shareholders; it is answerable only to its users and funded by those who pay for official Ghost hosting.<p>4. Pricing for official Ghost hosting is very reasonable ($5/month for 1 blog, $14/month for 5 blogs).<p>5. Although it&#x27;s still in development, the proposed Dashboard looks far more useful than competitors. WordPress&#x27; Dashboard often looks like a wasteland once a few plugins have been installed – a mish-mash of &quot;Upgrade to the PRO version!&quot; prompts and RSS updates from the WordPress feed.<p>And from a developer perspective:<p>1. GitHub-based workflow.<p>2. MIT licence instead of GPL.<p>3. Less code debt (for now!).<p>4. Handlebars-based theme templates that enforce separation of presentation and logic. (It will be possible to add custom handlebars tags via the Ghost Apps API in the future for more advanced stuff, but it&#x27;s already pretty solid.)<p>5. The official hosted version allows you to upload your own themes (unlike wordpress.com, for example).<p>As a developer and end-user, it&#x27;s already a more enjoyable experience than competing platforms for simple blogs, and I think by the end of the year – once the app API has launched and developers are adding forum apps and more – it will be a real competitor for more complex sites too.",1398873305

Studies have shown that, taking both prevalence and magnitude of the effect into account, watching television is the single strongest determining factor in quality of life, with the effect being monotonic: the less television you watch, the happier you are. At least one study corrected for confounding influences by comparing otherwise similar neighborhoods in Third World cities where television had become available versus where it had not, and the effect was striking: where television goes, quality of life takes a nosedive.<p>For discussion of these and related phenomena, see <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/addiction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/addiction.html</a> and <a href=""http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/why_we_havent_met_any_aliens/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/why_we_havent_met_an...</a>",1398872888

7674075,comment,7672749,7673991,7,0,kasey_junk,,,"&quot;As I understand it, George W. Bush deregulated the stock market and allowed multiple venues to compose the market. This resulted in stock trading becoming distributed among multiple venues. When a retail customer submits an order to an exchange they are required by law to give the customer the best price available (no front running). Since exchanges are now distributed they must communicate to ensure the best price is given to the customer. If a market participant can outrun this calculation by placing themselves on exchange A and exchange B simultaneously and transfer the information faster than the participating exchanges, then they are effectively able to front run the customer. There are no rules around this outrunning of the best price calculation, although most people agree there ought to be because it makes execution quality worse.&quot;<p>Your understanding of what is going on in latency arbitrage is incorrect and implies that a latency arbitrage trader can see your order before it executes on an exchange.  This is not true.<p>Further, the only people who think independent price synchronization provides worse execution are large block liquidity takers.  That is large institutional investors who have the intention to remove all the liquidity from a group of exchanges. They have always tried to hide their intentions so that the market cannot take those intentions into the account.  They are now using scare tactics to make it seem like this is a problem when in fact it is the markets behaving as they should.<p>Market segmentation & correct price discovery help small retail investors not hurt them.",1398872810

The fact that many trolls are pure parasites (i.e. while being racketeers they don&#x27;t produce anything as well) doesn&#x27;t mean that patent aggressors which do produce something can&#x27;t also be called trolls when they engage in the patent protection racket.<p>I.e. using software patents for defensive purposes is OK. Using them for aggression in practice is patent trolling or protection racket, and it doesn&#x27;t matter whether the troll produces anything or not. It&#x27;s enough to see any real cases of patent aggression to understand that. MS, Apple and the like which do produce stuff but constantly engage in patent protection racket can be called trolls.<p>Using patents for encouraging innovation isn&#x27;t the case here, since they come after competition which developed things independently, didn&#x27;t copy anything from them and so on. They simply want to fight competition using their patents as weapons, or extort money from competitors (like MS does), and threatening them that if they fight some patents, they can pull out more.

(Or in other words - if you want to check if your calculations are correct, you have to do the calculations again.) Ideal, fully automated tests are basically taking two implementations, run them side-by-side, and compare the results.<p>That&#x27;s why I am not a big fan of tests, in the sense that there is too much focus on them in the SW industry, and they seem like a hammer (useful but overused).<p>I think there should be more focus on writing the _one_ implementation correctly. This can be done with better abstractions (e.g. actor model for concurrency, functional programming, ..) and asserts (programming by contract), and maybe even automated SW proving. I don&#x27;t think these techniques are as popular as testing, but I wish they were more popular, because they let you write programs only once and correctly.<p>[Update: To specifically expand on point about asserts, if you can trivially convert test to assert, why not do it?

7673991,comment,7672749,7673807,1,0,dclusin,,,"As I understand it, George W. Bush deregulated the stock market and allowed multiple venues to compose the market. This resulted in stock trading becoming distributed among multiple venues. When a retail customer submits an order to an exchange they are required by law to give the customer the best price available (no front running). Since exchanges are now distributed they must communicate to ensure the best price is given to the customer. If a market participant can outrun this calculation by placing themselves on exchange A and exchange B simultaneously and transfer the information faster than the participating exchanges, then they are effectively able to front run the customer. There are no rules around this outrunning of the best price calculation, although most people agree there ought to be because it makes execution quality worse.<p>A technological solution to this problem is to either execute on alternative venues such as dark pools where the price and possibly quantity are hidden from all participants, or use an algorithm such as VWAP to hide your intentions. Smart money already does both of these. If you submit block orders to a public exchange now a days you&#x27;re considered foolish and are getting a bad deal. The reason why this keeps coming up is because the rubes are finally starting to realize what wall street already knows: they are getting screwed.<p>You do make a cogent point about discussion of automated trading being laughably imprecise, but your argument doesn&#x27;t really debunk the immorality of the behavior that is occurring.<p>And finally, your point about non-farm payroll is a non starter for me. What you are talking about is informed order flow (wall street), VS. uninformed order flow (you and me). When non-farm payroll is released designated market makers have been known withdraw from the market because the price is being corrected by the informed order flow.

7673858,comment,7672719,7673413,2,0,spion,,,"I completely agree. I think these issues stem from our industry&#x27;s tendencies to abstract the problem away from the solution before teaching the solution. This is the wrong way to teach.<p>If you show other developers how you solved <i>your</i> particular problem (how your solution came to be) and explain why you used that approach, many will quickly be able to discern how and when to apply your solution to their particular problem area. If instead you just give them a solution, they&#x27;re missing a piece of the puzzle and may arrive at the wrong conclusion.<p>Other developers are also pretty intelligent folk - don&#x27;t do your deduction for them. Let them do it themselves.<p>I think our industry suffers from the lack of studying and describing the history of concrete software systems. It could be done so easily now - we have the entire source code history available, we have the history of issues. Books could be written about the evolution of popular software systems - especially open-source classics (e.g. emacs or the linux kernel or Firefox). Those books would describe the problems encountered during the development and their solutions, the design / architectural decisions, as well as the evolution of the development process.<p>Studying software history should also help us not reinvent the wheel badly. If we studied history perhaps we would&#x27;ve known more about NLS or Smalltalk or why other ideas were invented. How many of us know <i>why</i> the concept of objects was invented in the first place? How many know why classes were invented - what particular problem prompted someone to invent them, and what the circumstances were at that point in time?<p>The reason why this history is so important is that when inventions go through the reuse process, they&#x27;re never quite that perfect at solving those newer problems compared to the original problem. Therefore the further away we are from the original problem, the less likely we will be to understand the general aspects of the solution or to re-use the original thinking process to adapt the solution to our needs.<p>Finally it will also allow us to gain at least some of the knowledge that can presently be gained only from experience and mentoring - which is always a good thing.",1398871187

7673807,comment,7672749,7673060,6,0,leverage,,,"Agreed. ML is the &quot;Wolf Hunter&quot;, but in this case, he was hunting sheep. I am astonished by the press&#x27;s reaction to this. I think a lot of it has to do with the relatively small and obscure HFT industry - it is not well understood, and it is easier to believe it is rigged than to understand what it is.<p>To even call it &quot;high frequency trading&quot; is not fair - this implied large volumes throughout the day by continuously providing quotes on both sides of a given security. Their PnL comes from the bid/ask spread and rebates for providing liquidity. They are primarily market makers. This is 99.99% of the HFT industry.<p>Instead, ML and IEX are talking about &quot;speed trading&quot; or, as the press has coined it, &quot;latency arbitrage&quot; - they take advantage of their speed to reach exchanges (2 milliseconds vs. 20 milliseconds) to front-run orders and react quicker to new information. These types of trades only happen at points during the day when signals are met, and they do not provide liquidity but rather cross existing orders (often times before the exchange receives the cancel message from the participant) and TAKE OUT liquidity. I would say less than 1% of HFT firms engage in this type of unethical activity.<p>An example: Imagine it&#x27;s 9:29am and the Dept of Labor Statistics is going to release the monthly unemployment numbers. There is a positive expectation, and so before market open there are a lot of buy SPY (S&P 500 ETF) orders queued. The report comes out at 9:30am as the markets open, and the numbers are bad. Now, a rational investor would immediately attempt to cancel his order for SPX as the market is going to move downward. Imagine at the same EXACT time, a speed trader see&#x27;s this investors buy order on the book and decided to cross him and sell. Due to his speed advantage, the exchange receives his message to cross before the investors message to cancel. The investor loses out, SPX invariably moves down, and the speed trader then buys everything he just sold for an essentially risk-less profit.<p>A final point is this: for any buy-side market participant (anything from a mutual fund to a &quot;Average joe&quot;), transaction costs are much lower due to the much higher liquidity and tightened spreads that high frequency trading has brought to the markets. HFT is making the markets more efficient.

Thanks to all commentators thus.<p>A very similar situation can be observed in Turkish: Turks went to Europe and Middle East in 4th century, the ones that went to Europe eventually died, and the ones that went to Middle East and formed empires, including the rather long lived and glorious Ottoman Empire. While they were busy becoming more Muslim and more Arabic, learning <i>fancy</i> Arabic and Persian words, borrowing their alphabet and elevating this new Ottoman language to be the language of the palace, and the language of art, whereas the public spoke their own languages (lots of ethnicities were within the umbrella of Ottomans); Renaissance and The French Revolution happened, which eventually got Ottomans to love and behold Europe, mainly France, and borrow their words and lifestyle. In 19th century, Ottoman language was such a travesty, the first lessons of an under-graduate History course in Turkey now teaches the language, albeit Turkey directly descended from Ottomans not even a century ago. Together with the Kemalist revolution did start a movement of linguistic purism, along which the Turkish language was greatly stripped from what made it Ottoman, and the result was an easy-to-learn, simple and consistent language.<p>Still, though, it&#x27;d bear the same effect with “Uncleftish Beholding” to the average Turkishman, a text where only Turkic-rooted words were used, as still there are lots of words in the language that come from Arabic, French, English and Latin. Also, it&#x27;d be a bother for the average Turkishman to communicate with a Middle-Asian Turk of modern times, language of whom is closer to pre-Islam Turkic languages.<p>It is fun to play games with language, watch it grow and find out about how it came to be the language it is today.",1398870091

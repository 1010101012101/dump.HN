The difference is that in many situations, operations on series may be composed functionally and yet execute iteratively, without the need to construct intermediate series values explicitly. In this manner, series provide both the clarity of a functional programming style and the efficiency of an iterative programming style.""",1228981426

394103,comment,393989,394036,0,0,unalone,,,"I think there's also a difference in the type of content. TV shows offer the possibility of mental stimulation. People will pay for quality. If I was able to, I'd get HBO for the level of programming. There's money to be made from quality.<p>Porn? Sure, it's wonderful when it's well-produced, but people don't care first and foremost about production value. They watch porn to masturbate in nearly all cases. That means that porn films benefit from shorter, more manageable scenes, and that quality doesn't matter whatsoever. The film industry has a subsection that operates based on quality. Porn profits almost exclusively from access: the easier access is, the more attention.<p>So TV still has some fight in it. So does the music industry, though I think in both cases there will be changes. Porn? I think that the professional industry is going to be gutted through-and-through. The porn industry can't compete with amateurs.",1228980818

Simple and easy.<p>As mentioned, Debian extends this by recommending a README.Debian to explain what differences from upstream documentation or defaults exist, and the rationale.<p>For example, enjoy the simplicity of /usr/share/doc/phpmyadmin/README.Debian. It answers all your questions, and also makes mention of security concerns you may not have realised exist had you, for example, just extracted a copy of phpmyadmin into your web site.<p>And now you have enough information to know what to do next with anything that you install using apt-get, Or yum, or rpm, or portage, or (I'm speculating here) autopackage for that matter.",1228980771

394097,comment,393904,393941,0,0,yters,,,"Another problem is that our society attaches romance to being depressed and smart, such that people can sometimes go out of their way to be depressed just so they seem smart.  Additionally, smart people who lack EQ will find their self esteem in being perceived as smart, both by themselves and others, and thus have incentive to be depressed, especially if they are already depressed from being lonely. So, we've just got a nasty vicious cycle going on with smartness and depression.<p>Just examine your first impression of a happy person and an unhappy person.  The former will probably seem more vapid to you.  Or, look at how depression themed submissions are highly modded on this site (check my submission history for an example).",1228980500

394075,comment,393706,393706,0,0,patio11,,,"The real title of this should be ""The traditional employment model sucks"", and I agree with that statement.<p>I spend 60+ hours a week on the clock as a Japanese salaryman.  It kills me.  It kills everyone else even more than me because a) I'm the slacker American who actually leaves after a mere 60 hours and b) I don't have a wife and kids.<p>And looking at my paystub, oh boy, the incentives at the margin make me weep.  Monetarily and otherwise.  A starting Japanese engineer makes $2,200 a month plus biannual bonuses of something like $4,000 plus benefits.  I've got 4 years professional experience so I'm above that but not grossly above it and, anyhow, treble it and it wouldn't make a difference.<p>The incentive at the margin, on a professional level, is to spend one hour slowly working through the 473rd unit test case on a feature that will be used once a year that isn't crucial to any client anywhere.  The feature exists largely to keep up the appearance that the company is working hard for their money.  I love programming but I don't love <i>this</i> programming.<p>The incentive at the monetary level is, well, ""less than motivational"".<p>Now I also own a small business selling software.  Its no great shakes, but I get to pick the features I implement and the marketing/etc direction I choose.  And when I do stuff right, its not the 473rd bullet point on a spec that may never see the light of day, its fifteen paying customers sending me Christmas cards with pictures of their kids.  Or if I kick butt and take names for two weeks, rather than getting a pat on the head from the boss, a new stack of busywork, and $60 added to my Christmas bonus (yaaaaay), my sales increase by $400 a month FOR FOREVER.<p>Is it easy?  I don't think anything worthwhile is easy: I've been part-timing this for 2.5 years now and am just creeping into the $20k a year sales range.  But someday, in the not so distant future (certainly not 5 years from now like the slideshare presentation suggests), it will be enough.  (It actually would cover my burn rate at the moment but I'm a bit of a cautious type.)<p>And then I will calligraphy-up my resignation letter, make my bows, and walk out of the office while the sun is still shining for a change.<p>And, as God is my witness, that will be the last time I ever deal with a company as an employee.  If they want to be business partners, we can be business partners.  If they want me to live my life for them out of a sense of obligation, ho ho ho, I will be happy to introduce them to service providers who are more appropriate to their needs.<p>(This isn't really a Japan-only thing, incidentally.  There are any number of American companies which could be my company, easily.  And there are Japanese companies which are better but, really, none is ever going to be as good to me as I would be.)",1228979085

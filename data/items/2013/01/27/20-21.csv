We are killing our ecosystem already now. These other human problems like child mortality, poverty etc are of course emotionally and personally big ones, but resolving them would make world more crowded and not better place at all. \nMy suggestion: if you put X amount of money to increase human population, then you must put also at least same amount to resolve all the next problems what we people generate: over-harvesting, co2 and other greenhouse gases, pollution etc.",1359320394

No one here has done even the basic work I would expect of someone trying to understand teacher evaluation as a solution and compare it to other alternatives.<p>I would argue that the whole point of HN is to think through arguments in other domains and build intuition by reasoning through problems and arguments. Otherwise, what's the point? No one is going to arrive at this thread and scan the top-rated comments for the solution to his school district's problems.<p>In cases where actual decisions are being made where the analyses are much more thorough and fully validating much more expensive, other techniques are available. First, one generally builds an awareness of the strengths of each team member which suggests where errors may be more likely. Additionally, one can check a random set of the most likely problem areas. Perhaps, most importantly, while everyone won't re-do every analysis, it's highly unlikely that an any important analysis will only be done once. So one can expect that the high-level results are generally consistent.",1359320360

First, the companies that want the work done need to commit to pay before it's done, so the developer knows how much they can expect to receive.  Second, on the other hand, there needs to be an evaluation step, so the contributors don't have to pay if the work does not live up to their collective expectations.  I don't think the Kickstarter-style model, where the developer receives all the money in advance unconditionally, can attract a lot of contributions from businesses.<p>And as you say, companies would need to know exactly what they're buying with this money.

I work with very messy data. I've also found that the more experience people have with something, the less confident they are about their expertise so I won't claim to be NotWrong, but the statistics here really aren't hard. It's linear regression with data that appears, cursorily, to be gaussian, close-ish to iid, etc. The question isn't  ""did Gary do the math wrong?"" it's more ""is he interpreting the data reasonably?""</i><p>I will make a strong claim: If doctor effectiveness were this stable, and it were the only data I had available, I would choose a doctor on this metric, ceteris paribus.<p>I found a scatterplot by the author that uses smaller marks so it looks a lot less blob-ish and more heat-map-ish:<p><a href=""http://garyrubinstein.teachforus.org/2012/02/26/analyzing-released-nyc-value-added-data-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://garyrubinstein.teachforus.org/2012/02/26/analyzing-re...</a><p>I'm trying to track down the original data to verify this myself, but a couple of quick points:<p>There definitely seems to be good evidence of a relationship. It might be ""weak"" but that's not the same thing as ""ineffective"". Considering the number of data points, it makes it unlikely that the trend occurred by chance. This plot also makes it clear why the averaging made it look so pretty: the average in just about any percentile group in 08-09 matched 09-10 regardless of how finely it's divided (to a point).<p>It's certainly the case that there's a lot of ""noise"". The question is how to interpret it. One might conclude that there is a lot of ""measurement noise"" -- that teacher evaluations are inherently messy and rather uninformative except as a larger trend. There seems to be reasonable support for this! Students aren't the same, even from year to year. Of course it could ""signal noise"" - maybe teachers themselves change from year to year. Perhaps one year you're more motivated, the next your not, or vice versa.<p>To understand the implications of this noise, we also need to ask what we're using it for. For instance, if this were a plot of the correlation between money donated to Watsi and quality-of-life, you'd probably think you were doing pretty well! You might point out that a particular quality-of-life metric is flawed or noisy, or that the quality-of-life depends on lots of things besides health, but likely you'd be happy that you're clearly causing some benefit.<p>So when we ask whether the data suggest the viability of value-added measurements <i>in aggregate</i>, to me that seems to be a yes. But if we ask whether the data suggest using these measurements to make a decision on a <i>per-teacher</i> basis, that depends on the context of the alternatives! If this is the only thing we have to go by, perhaps it's not so bad.<p>I would love to see how stable the other parts of the teacher evaluation fit in. If you combine multiple noisy signals, you often get a much better picture of what's going on! This accounts for only 1/3 of the teacher's evaluation. I would like to think that if you appeared not to be a value-added teacher, but your principals and coworkers spoke highly of you, that you'd still get that raise.<p>Also, I'm looking forward to multiple years of this data - if your score accounts for 35 percent of the variance from one year to the next, multiple years might look a lot better. Perhaps in deciding teacher tenure, scores over 5-10 years could be really useful.",1359319436

Education policy is the issue that drew me to participate on Hacker News,<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4728123"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4728123</a><p>and I'm glad to see that so many participants, from the founder on to the newest member, enjoy thinking about and checking facts on education issues.<p>There is other research on the issue of teacher quality and value-added measures to assess teacher quality,<p><a href=""http://hanushek.stanford.edu/publications/teacher-quality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hanushek.stanford.edu/publications/teacher-quality</a><p>and I encourage Hacker News participants to dig through some of the other publications to figure out what the best available current data show.<p>The other comments here suggest that the blog author of the submitted blog post is overstating his own case at least as much as he accuses the Gates Foundation supporters of overstating their case. If people who oppose the kind of teacher ratings proposed by the Gates Foundation really had courage of their convictions, they might try to let learners have full power to shop for teachers, on the grounds that teacher quality measures miss many dimensions of teacher performance that are important to individual learners. In fact, very few states even have as easy and time-proven a policy reform as statewide open enrollment (which my state has had for almost a generation now)<p><a href=""http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/EnrollChoice/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/EnrollChoice/index.h...</a><p>and no state yet lets learners shop for schools on an equal per-capita funding basis whether the school is state-operated or not (as the Netherlands has for more than a century). Teachers will have plenty of deserved professional respect and regard from their clients if their clients have power to shop. But if policy proposals for learner power to shop are rejected, hand in hand with rejecting proposals for evaluating teachers for their effectiveness in publicly subsidized instruction, I wonder what the true agenda is. What assurance do we (we parents, we taxpayers, we members of the general public) have that all schools are staffed with the best available teachers unless someone is checking on how the teachers are doing their work?",1359319435

5125546,comment,5123223,5123223,2,0,dkarl,,,"The article would have benefited from some clarity about the different meanings of happiness:  Frankl's, which isn't discussed at all, and the definition used in the psychological research cited by the article.  I think the author wrote a short article about a very provocative point raised in psychological research, dressed it up by bookending it with references to Frankl, and then completely ignored the contradictions and interesting questions raised by juxtaposing the two.<p>I mean, look at the transition from the Frankl intro to the meat of the article.  First, the discussion of Frankl seems to imply that happiness depends on meaning.  Quite possibly -- depending on the definition of happiness.  ""Research"" is invoked to support Frankl:  ""having purpose and meaning in life increases overall well-being and life satisfaction"" and so on.  Then this non-sequitur:<p><i>""It is the very pursuit of happiness,"" Frankl knew, ""that thwarts happiness.""<p>---<p>This is why some researchers are cautioning against the pursuit of mere happiness.</i><p>... followed by a discussion of how meaning and happiness are <i>different</i> and can be achieved independently.  The article jumps from Frankl's point, which is that happiness cannot be pursued because it must ""ensue"" from meaning, to a very different point, which is that happiness <i>can</i> be achieved without meaning, and this is a socially harmful thing because it is associated with selfish feelings and behaviors!  They're completely different ideas going in completely different directions, and the article just staples them together, with Frankl being the piece incongruously tacked on.<p>However, at the heart of the article is a psychological study that tackles a challenging question that goes back at least to Socrates' discussion of the Ring of Gyges.  It is a common feature of many Greek schools of philosophy that they start from the assumption that the purpose of life is to be happy and conclude that happiness requires living (roughly) a moral life.  This is a convenient but dubious coincidence:  we may not be convinced, but we dearly wish it to be true.<p>Now we have psychologists apparently warning that scientific evidence is accumulating against this cherished link between ""happiness"" and virtuous, socially constructive living.  This is a fascinating point.  It's a scientific challenge to what you might call a very common ""religious"" belief that is a core belief of many non-religious people as well.  The Greek philosophers, and many people today whom we might call progressives or liberals, believe that to make people good, you only have to educate them[1].  Understanding will compel them to act virtuously, even if their only concern is their own happiness.  The belief that people who properly understand themselves will be good, compassionate people continues to be widespread today, bolstered by research into our empathic, social nature.  Against this is the conservative view of people as innately morally flawed beings, driven by selfish desires, socially redeemable only through order and punishment, morally redeemable only through divine grace.  The conservative view is bolstered by the evolutionary reasoning, which points out that genetic self-interest is only partially and accidentally congruent with ordinary notions of morality.<p>Anyway, I'm off to read the new study that prompted the article[2], and I can at least appreciate the article for surfacing this study, linking to it, and prompting me to think about these things again.<p>[1]  Buddhists can be included in this group, and I'm sure there are many others I've left out.<p>[2]  <a href=""http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/pages/documents/SomeKeyDifferencesHappyLifeMeaningfulLife_2012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/pages/documents/SomeKe...</a>",1359318815

They spend 3x more in R&D than Apple does, and it shows.<p>When you look at what has come out of Microsoft Research in the past, you have things like C#, PixelSense, ClearType, and Photosynth to name a few. And that doesn't include other labs like Office Labs. If you ever get the chance to tour their lab space, it's crazy the sort of things they have prototypes for, as well as the things they're striving for with their productivity vision video.<p>Plus, remember that the definition of innovation is ""A new method, idea, product, etc: 'technological innovations'."" That's exactly what Microsoft Research does. Things like the real-time translation that came out recently, the projected gaming system, and of course the things they're doing with NUI and the Kinect and using them as input methods for computers. Just because they're not viable right now does not discount the fact that they are making things that are some day going to change the way we work, and play.<p>Edit: And I would definitely not consider Apple innovative, in any way. They make products for the masses, and, yes, they are awesome products, but they don't really innovate. I can consider the iPhone to be an innovative product since it changed the way we view smartphones. But after that, they've simply changed the previous year's version and bumped up the specs.

According to Heckewelder in Iroquios society ""whatever liveth on the land, whatever groweth out of the earth, and all that is in the rivers and waters, was given jointly to all"".<p>Classes emerged when one group of people decided that they were more entitled to the Earth's natural resources then everyone else. These people made these natural resources into their private property and in order to get wealth out of those natural resources they made human workers into their private property as well. These owners became the ruling class and their subjects became the slave class.<p>Slavery existed in human society for several millennia until it was partially replaced by feudalism. In feudal societies, there was still a ruling class that controlled the natural resources and violently suppressed anyone who opposed them, except that their serfs had a little bit more autonomy and they were tied to the land rather then their masters.<p>The industrial revolution changed everything. In industrial societies people were able to work in other sectors of the economy besides the primary sector, which allowed some people to live free of the tyranny of the landlords. However, new forms of private property emerged corresponding to the new sectors of the economy. In the manufacturing sector, there was private property in the means of production and the instruments of labor, and in the knowledge sector there was intellectual private property.<p>The private ownership of our natural resources also still exists. As an example, Gina Rinehart, the world's richest woman, is a mining tycoon who inherited her control of Australia's natural mining resources. Classes have existed throughout written history and with people like Gina Rinehart they apply today as much as ever before.<p>> <i>Open Source Everything</i><p>You want to eliminate the form of private property that exists in your sector of the economy: intellectual property. This is good, but what are you going to do for people working in the primary and secondary sectors of the economy? Do you want farmers to continue to subjected to the tyranny of the landlords and do you want for manufacturing workers to continue to be completely alienated from their workplace?<p>> <i>Stop watching Americana Idol, learn from all the free resources online and lift yourself up from the bootstraps.</i><p>What is with this ad hominem attack?

Beginners often overload themselves trying to learn thousands of kanji when they don't even know the meanings of the compounds that the kanji are used in. I believe that Heisig even mentions in his introduction something to the effect that using his book won't really improve your Japanese, it will just improve your ability to learn Japanese. Rather than spend hours per day studying Heisig for months, I would recommend a more traditional approach to beginners of learning the most common kanji as they learn the vocabulary.<p>For the advanced student looking to master kanji, then a method like Heisig's seems best. However, for those interested in the Heisig method, I recommend this book: Kanji ABC [1]. It is similar to Heisig's but organizes the kanji so that you learn similar kanji together. Also, while Heisig spends much time trying to get you to memorize convoluted association sentences, Kanji ABC simply gives you the radicals (similar to Heisig's 'primitives') and you build your own association sentences.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Kanji-ABC-Systematic-Approach-Characters/dp/0804819572"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Kanji-ABC-Systematic-Approach-Characte...</a>",1359318141

Things should just Work. The terminal is a deprecated tool compared to new intuitive IDE. Most of you won't agree with these statements (And I clearly don't) but that's really what I've felt every time I'd talk with a game developer friend or colleague. And, this mentality goes back to when I was an engineering students.. While I had fun learning linux and Python, friends graduating in video gaming would laugh of Python for being a ""scripting non-performant language"" or they would play around in visual studio with C# and making forms or build some games with XNA.<p>So, sometimes I think it's not that much about linux not being ""good enough"" but more about video game developers' mentality to not fit with it. Man, I won't lie, I'm an experienced Linux developer and user and I always have to lurk in all kind of forums and RTFM on every small things that needs to be installed (which is not in the standard library). And, it often happens that I break stuff and spend countless hours trying to fix it. Hell, even last week, I've upgraded a server on Archlinux and it totally broke my system without any warning. I really needed help so I went on #archlinux and I've been told that I should have read the archlinux news before tempting an update. Fair enough, I guess.. but I can understand that on a extremely tight schedule, games developers can't waste time on stuff like that.

If they really care about doing biology, chances have been that they aren't the greatest programmers (I understand this may be changing, but still seemed to be the case 4 years ago when I left bioinformatics). This leaves the people who are happy with the status quo, staying in bioinformatics, and the people who are dissatisfied, going to other fields where they feel their work can have more of an impact.<p>In my experience, what happens is that biologists define the science, and they depend on the computer scientists / engineers to implement solutions to their computational problems.

YouTube can be a cesspool of racism but if Twitter has any comments related to one particular group, it faces legal action. I don't want to preach to the choir about free speech; however, what do people really expect from censorship?<p>Let's say some racist group was spewing hatred on Twitter. Now, let's say someone was, rightfully, offended and then went and tattle tailed to Twitter or the legal authorities. What is their benefit from that? Those people still think and believe exactly the same things. You could say at the very least it reduces the spread of certain and so forth, but I don't think it does; just because they can't say it on Twitter doesn't mean it is not said hundreds or thousands of times a day. I don't know why anyone would want the government to be our nanny in this case. If anything, taking action like this just eggs them on.",1359316931

Rather, they have forgotten the stroke order on certain characters, or often confuse two similar characters. It's very debatable as to whether this has been caused by more widespread use of computers, or if such ""character amnesia"" has always been present. The same can be said for spelling: Do you think English speakers never made spelling mistakes before spellcheck?",1359316888

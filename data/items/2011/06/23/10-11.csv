I think it's something of a mantra in the advertising world.<p>It struck me at the time as I was working with a CEO who thought length == quality in communication, both writing and discussions.  I think that he wrote things for his own gratification, it probably gave him a feeling of productivity.  Sadly a lot of what he wrote wasn't read, or not a carefully as it should have been.  It takes effort and  generosity to write for the reader.",1308826761

I wanted to stress the fact that, even though most atheists completely accept that humans are animals like any others, just with ""bigger"" brains, there is still vestiges of the time where we thought it was not the same at all.<p>Some of those vestiges can be found in our language. Here, it was saying ""human and animals"" instead of the more correct ""human and <i>other</i> animals"" (without the emphasis of course).  This kind of phrasing tend to promote the higher status of humankind as self evident, while frankly it is not. (I've read once that Dolphins may be almost as sentient and sapient as we are.  In this case, they should have right they currently don't have.)",1308826755

You could also get something much more cheaper at $100/month which would be really low. The tradition is that the security deposit is 10*monthly-rent and paid before you move. Also its always month to month so there is no 1-year lease like in the US.<p>A new decent car will run you $8000 but you could use ezdrive.in or some cab service. Or you could buy a Nano for $2500  (or a second hand car) and get a full time driver for $140 a month.  Maintaining a driver is a pain in the butt I've heard. Or you could just use Autorickshaws every day at $1 each way for a 45 minute trip. ($50 a month?) but they are a hassle.<p>Traffic is THE horrendous pain in the ass. Make sure your not driving at 8:10am - 10:30am or 4:30pm - 7pm.<p>Cellphone - you can get prepaid with the same number of minutes as Rupees. So 300 minutes would cost you $6. Also calls to the US are Rs.7/minute or 14cents/minute.<p>Vegetables are cheaper than the US. Fruits are about as expensive as in the US here unless they are in season. But you get exotic stuff from jackfruit to lychees.<p>Internet is like $30/m for really fast access. And Electiecity about $20/m max. Cable is like $10 for a bunch of channels including HBO.<p>Clothes and such are about 50% the cost of india for mid-range stuff. All medium-high to high end stuff is the same cost or more expensive than the US (and usually slightly cheaper looking for some reason).<p>Bangalore is full of pubs and clubs. I dont know about hte dating scene as I've never lived in Bangalore per se.<p>Interest rates are high. You cna get like 5% in a bank savings account here but I dont know if you can take it back wtih you and so on. You'll have to look that up.<p>Thats about it.<p>You should start applying before you move here so at least you have a process started. Also to get a VISA to work in India you might need a job offer.

The diversity of a species can be charted, and I would like to see a chart plotting that diversity.  Humans will be on the edge of that chart, but I assume there will be close 2nd.  Then the question will be, why is there only ONE species X?<p>The genetic difference between two of the most distantly related humans is actually less than that of a typical ape family. This leads geneticists to estimate that our species went through a bottleneck about 70,000 years ago when there must have been less than 20,000 humans alive.<p>Furthermore, for specialization to occur usually requires isolation and a whole lot of time for mutation and differential selection to occur. The human race is branching off into different species of human to this day, just give it another 50 or 80 thousand years and there will be multiple species of human.<p>Humans dominated this planet inside 10 thousand years, in evolutionary time frames that is a blink of an eye.",1308826475

Constant up gradation of the technology from web.1.0 to web 2.0 to the next level is causing severe headache for the smaller firms who have invested heavily in the software and hardware infrastructure. Is there any way out to cover all these aspect and apply the minds on the business aspect only is the question revolving in every small business heads mind?\nCloud computing concept which was unraveled few years before offers a glimpse of hope to remove those regular software up gradation and change in the hardware to match up to the newer technology standards. Cloud computing which is referred also as Saas (software as a service) has been in the picture for long time but it took years to form a concrete platform which is useful for the small enterprises.\nCloud computing enables small IT firms to access the technology as fast and powerful as fortune 500 companies at low cost. The constant hassle to maintain the server and database is now shifted to some professional company who employs his own staff to operate the servers. One has to just login on the Saas and operate easily with no frills attitude.\nAdvantages of cloud computing\nInstallation\nThe basic form of all Saas system enables one to just sign up and start the work easily without going on for regular updates for the software or maintaining the hardware which is major reason for lack of productivity in smaller firms.<p>Accessibility\nThe ease to access the cloud computing also opens a window off opportunity for the persons as one can access it fusing net from anywhere. So no need to loose hairs whether your data is saved in your office system or home desktop. It makes the data to be present online wherever you want.<p>Easy to integrate\nAll of one have must have faced this problem whenever they have tried to upgrade the system or add some new software. The softwares fail to connect with the required hardware and respond outdated hardware or require some other version of the software. Cloud computing removes all this hassles as one has to never bother about any updates or fixing any bug.\nCloud computing enables the small firms to install and run application in one go and start the work immediately without caring about further bootlegs which have stalled the work.\nMost of the softwares available on these system are open source and available free of cost which saves a huge sum of money for the users.\nWe are using various form of cloud computing which has enabled us to have an easy frame work. Google mail and other services are one of the prime examples of this setup where one has to just sign up and move on for using the features. So if you are looking out to cut cost and reduce the burden of your network professional then cloud computing may be the viable solution for your company.",1308826309

As a general rule, unless the build script tells it otherwise, a compile won't perform an optimisation that could make the optimised version give a different result from the basic one.<p>Of course you may decide it is safe enough, in which case you might find your compiler has an option to tell it that you would like such optimisations to be considered. Stepping away from arithmetic for a moment, variable aliasing is another example of this. If your code could potentially update a value several ways through pointer jiggery-pokery a compile may decide certain register based optimisations are not safe, and there are often directives you can give to tell the compile that it can consider these optimisations as you are sure the code does nothing that would make them a problem (the compile can't decide this for itself as that would potentially take for ever due to the ""halting"" problem).",1308825930

At the end of each individual operation the intermediate result needs to be stored in a floating point data type and at this point it is rounded to fit the limits of that type - changing the order of the operations to try optimise in the way being talked about changes the number of intermediate results that get rounded (so change the error at the end of the process), and some numbers ""suffer"" more from the rounding than others (0.5 can be represented accurately in binary, 0.6 can not) so sometimes the difference in the values you get at the end of operations that are mathematically equivalent (until you consider the accuracy of intermediate results) will be much larger than other times.<p>Of course if <i>all</i> compilers optimised a.a.a.a.a.a to (a.a.a)^2 then it would be OK as for the same data type all code would give the same result, but for consistency as not all code does do this optimisation it is safer for none to do it unless the programmer explicitly codes that way (and therefore takes responsibility for the fact that the ""optimal"" version may give different results when compared to code using the unaltered version, rather than the compiler deciding that this is OK).<p>The same is true for any chained floating point operations. changing a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a to a*20 (if one multiple is faster than 19 additions) will give different results.",1308825465

The FI does have a responsibility to monitor excess transactions and prevent non-occasional violations by either converting the account, or removing transactional abilities. So yeah, a token fee wouldn't be a viable strategy.<p>Getting back to the topic at hand though, I don't think this would be much of a problem for fancy automatic transfers. Deposits to savings accounts aren't covered transactions, so something like ""If I spend less than x budget this week, send the rest to savings"" would work.<p>If the FI designed a product that would see more frequent withdrawals, they could just designate it a transactional account and skip the whole issue entirely.

If you knew both shards were on the same box you could do cross-shard joins if you used schemas like this but you would need some potentially tricky logic that determines if it is working with all shards on the same machine.<p>Thankfully most of the joins happen within a shard (hashing and sharding on something like a user_id) with the exception being various analysis and aggregation queries.<p>Using PostgreSQL's schemas is admittedly not too different from just using many DBs in MySQL or something else but in practice I've found that extra layer of organization helps keep things neater.

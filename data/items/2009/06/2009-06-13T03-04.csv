Back in 2006, I got kicked off of Facebook for registering as the pseudonym I used on the internet. It wasn't anyone else's name, but there'd be no way for them to know that.

655775,comment,655222,655222,0,0,pradocchia,,,"Have your read Kimball's Data Warehouse Toolkit? I'm partial to the first edition (1996). It's mostly conceptual stuff: design rationale, OLTP vs OLAP, fact vs dimension, type II SCDs (very important), surrogate keys, aggregate navigation etc.<p>Most code in a data warehouse is ETL code, and much of that is obscured behind the interface of big-name tools like Informatica. I don't think you are interested in that. People who roll their own have typically rolled with Perl. Try a search on Perl + ETL and you might find something.<p>Other items of interest:<p>* Pentaho, an open-source BI suite. Includes ETL, reporting and multidimensional cubes.<p>* Column-oriented data stores like Vertica, Sybase IQ, MonetDB, and Infobright. MonetDB and Infobright are both open source. Infobright integrates with MySQL, so that might be up your alley.<p>* SSDs may or may not turn data warehousing on its head. Yet to be determined.<p>* schema-driven ETL is very powerful: define an input view/function, a target table, a few naming conventions, and generate your ETL code directly off the system tables--ETL with opinions, as it were.<p>EDIT:<p>For online resources, I used read intelligententerprise.com. Can't vouch for its current quality. Back then it was hit or miss, and promotional items frequently overshadowed substantive material.",1244864606

Starting a new job often sees you filling another's shoes, ice skating means crossing over the scars in the ice left by others, and even tagging a blank wall means working with the imperfections of the builder and painter that created your canvas.<p>This indirect contact with others creates an often subtle, but uniquely human experience - a shared narrative of being that provides a life enriching subtext.<p>Hoss exploits this shared narrative in his work to great effect, and will use his inaugural Flashbelt presentation to analyze a series of projects that build on each other's successes and failures to deliver increasingly rich experiences.

Hammers haven't changed much in the last 100 years, so why should our tools change radically? There are people who have been using Emacs for 10+ years. Making radical changes negatively affects programmer productivity.<p>Hackers embrace new programming paradigms whole heartedly. Learning new programming languages or grokking a new library/framework is fun. Suddenly replacing the tools that have become muscle-memory with something completely different is definitely <i>not</i> fun.<p>IMO, revolution is favored when it comes to programming languages, frameworks and libraries.

Something about the fact that I look at a monitor makes it clear that I'm not in the environment, but sound does not have that limitation. (Relatedly, if you've ever seen the effect of using Fresnel lenses to project the monitor at infinity, that makes the immersion much more deep.

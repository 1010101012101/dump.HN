5041256,comment,5039567,5041146,1,0,biot,,,"No it doesn't cover it. If you're building a trivial software app in a week which costs beer money to get going and maintain via a cheap hosted service, then sure... you should just visit random.org and generate a number from 1 to 100 and charge that (per month, year, one-time, or whatever) because who cares.<p>But let's say you're building a non-trivial product and you've hired 4 engineers to work alongside you for 3 months to get the product off the ground to the point where you can start bringing customers onboard and billing them. These engineers come with a fully loaded cost of, say, $100K/year each. Maybe you're bootstrapping this venture via savings plus a second mortgage on your home to get to that stage and that's $100K you'll need to pay back to the bank plus interest.<p>As you bring paying clients onboard, you're going to need to hire support staff. What ratio of clients to support staff do you figure you will need? You will also need to ramp up your server instances to handle the load. Maybe you'll need to hire a full-time DBA. What is your marketing outlay for acquiring new customers and what's the conversion rate so that you can calculate your cost per acquisition? Do you have a sense of the lifetime value of each customer? Can you guesstimate the CPA and LTV to within a small multiple based on asking people in your network who are familiar with comparable services?<p>How do you factor initial sunk cost into the price? What sort of payback period on your second mortgage should you go with so that you're spreading out the costs over time rather than front-loading it all? How should you factor for continued growth, contingency situations, insurance, office space, potential legal risks, and a whole host of other factors to ensure that you actually are making a profit? There is a science to arriving at a price and having a certain amount of confidence that the price you chose will result in a profit. Saying ""pick a number and ensure you're making a profit"" does not help anybody in calculating whether there is profit to be had.",1357876382

5041223,comment,5037089,5038160,1,0,Sodel,,,"> However it speaks of a compiler for ALGOL... it was compiled down to machine instructions. Assembly is just a representation of machine instructions, so I don't see how it can be said to not have an assembly language.<p>In this sense, you're completely right. But I think that people who grok the system mean something a bit different when they say it doesn't have an assembly language. (Disclaimer: I have no firsthand experience with Burroughs mainframes.)<p>The Burroughs system didn't execute Algol directly, true. But, the machine representation that your compiled down to was essentially a high-level proto-Algol. It wasn't a disticnt, ""first-class citizen"". It was, if you like, Algol ""virtual machine bytecode"" for a virtual machine that wasn't virtual.<p>If you're writing in C, or some other higher-level programming languages, there are times when you want more fine-grained control over the hardware than the more plush languages provide. That's the time to drop down to assembly code, to talk to the computer ""in its own language"".<p>The Burroughs mainframes had nothing analogous to that. The system was designed to map as directly to Algol as they could. It's machine language wasn't distinct from the higher-level language that you were supposed to use. To talk to a Burroughs system ""in its own language"" would be to write a rather more verbose expression of the Algol code you'd have had to write anyway, but not particularly different in principle.<p>So, I guess the answer to whether or not the Burroughs systems did or did not have an assembly language is a philosophical one. :P",1357875410

5041135,comment,5040449,5041002,2,0,chipsy,,,"The way I would put it is: most of the things we call ""wisdom"" are more like ""fashion."" It's fashionable to be ""in the cloud."" It's fashionable to ""fail fast."" And so on. These are cyclical attributes; one can always find, at the least, an anecdotal situation which demonstrates or disproves their worth. And over a period of time - one year, five years, 30 years - the fashion runs its course, gets replaced by something else, and then gets revived again.<p>And - the other part of this is - tech businesses, and consequently tech employees, are entirely reliant on staying within the fashion to make their money. Any single product you push out today has a good chance of devaluing within a few years, if the industry as a whole moves on. And so, over and over, part of the fashion cycle is the monopoly play - every company races to monopolize and lock in its users so that it can break through the fashion cycle, sit on the product with old tech, and maximize extraction. But then, some time later, it gets disrupted by a startup, which then proceeds to lock in its users...<p>Triple-O strategies (open standard, open source, open development) seem to break the fashion cycle in software over the very long-term and force business to move to new categories(a good thing for the global economy, especially with software demand being ever-increasing). This is especially true when an open solution can break out of the ""back office"" and improve its UX. But one of the big, largely unanswered questions is whether businesses can be given economic incentives to remain open, and whether this phenomenon can escape software and move into hardware.",1357873867

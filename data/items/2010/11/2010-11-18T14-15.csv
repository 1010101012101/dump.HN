1917920,comment,1917490,1917669,0,0,DougWebb,,,"Yeah it does, but it's not as useful as you'd think. On my phone, the breakdown is always like 40% Display, 30% Idle, 20% for various system things, and the last 10% is stuff I can actually control. My display is set to auto brightness, but it has a short shutoff timer and I shut it off manually most of the time when I stop looking at it. I've tried low brightness settings but that didn't make much difference. Wireless, Bluetooth, and GPS don't make much difference either but I always keep them off.<p>The one thing that seems to make a huge difference is having the cell signal on when there is no tower in range. The phone gets hot and burns battery juice when it's trying to find a tower. My office has lousy reception, so on days when the signal is bad my battery is nearly dead by the time I'm ready to go home.<p>It used to be completely dead almost every day unless I recharged during the day, but I bought an extended battery. They should just come with the bigger batteries, even if the phones cost a bit more. It only sticks out a bit, and makes the battery life much more livable.",1290092194

It can be very easy for the native speakers to dominate a discussion unintentionally (and even when trying not to).<p>The impression Erlang gives me is one of being almost an anti-language, emphasising the system at large and discouraging over sophistication in the details. I think the point Joe Armstrong makes about hardware interoperability is telling. His vision of software is one much closer to hardware and the networking.

This has been discussed often, but it can be crippling - as soon as you hit the tiniest mental roadblock, you switch your browser to Reddit, next thing you know it's 20 minutes later and not only is your roadblock not solved, you even forgot what you were doing.  So then you read more Reddit while you try to remember.<p>It's terrible, and a lot of it isn't even conscious, until the day is over and you realize how little you did.<p>My friend made a good point - you don't NEED more than 15 minutes a day to keep up to date with what's on sites like Reddit or HN.  You can spend a lot more time, but beyond a certain point it's just frustration that you've already read all of it.<p>So I installed LeechBlock:<p><a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4476/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4476/</a><p>I set it to allow 15 minutes of access every 6 hours to my timesinks, and I set it to not allow access to its settings during the blocked times (so I can't easily turn it off).<p>At first I would hit the blocked page every few minutes, without even realizing that I intended to do so.  The frequency was a bit shocking, to be honest - part of it was honestly muscle memory by then (alt-tab to browser, type ""re"", down, enter).  The blocked page made it possible to force myself to focus on work again, every time, but it also made me realize how badly my brain patterns had been disrupted - my brain just craved distractions and did NOT want to focus for more than a few minutes at a time, which is never enough to do anything meaningful.<p>After about a week, the cravings for distraction were a lot lower.  After about two weeks, they were mostly gone.  I've now settled into a good rhythm, I complete tasks without interruption and check the time sinks for a few minutes at a time in between tasks - and I always have the safety net of the 15 minutes per 6 hours limit.  I usually hit that limit, but not always.<p>Sure, it's trivial to circumvent LeechBlock (just use a different browser, for example), but that's not the point.  The point is that you are making a conscious decision that what your brain is doing is not OK, and you need to re-train it to do what you want.  Things like LeechBlock are not magical solutions, but just tools to help you do that.<p>Edit: I prefer LeechBlock to the hostsfile hacks because it's not as rigid: it lets me settle into a natural rhythm that works for me, which also means I'm a lot less likely to turn it off and ""forget"" to turn it back on.",1290091887

Google seeded the world with Android to jumpstart the smartphone revolution faster. That means that more people will see more web ads sooner. For every day that X people view web ads, Google makes money; this is especially true if that day is <i>tomorrow</i>, rather than five years from now, because Google's share of the web ad business is really good now and doesn't seem likely to go up from here. [1] So Google increased the area under the smartphone-users-vs-time curve for the next few years, and will then make money on that.<p>Google also makes money on Apple's products, of course. If Apple were capable or interested in saturating the near-term market with iPhones, Google wouldn't have needed to bother with Android, and maybe they wouldn't. And, to the extent that Apple <i>does</i> eventually saturate the market with iPhones, Google might slack off on Android.

Blocks are actually a great example: what matz did was realize that often, you're only passing one anonymous function to another, and so he added special syntax to make it nicer. Procs aren't some conversion tool to upgrade blocks, Procs are the general case, and blocks are just a special one. That said, I can't remember the last time I actually needed to type Proc.new. With that said, you may disagree, but you can see where I'm getting at. Just because something did it _first_ doesn't mean they did it best. But that really comes down to taste, right?<p>> The main issue I have with Hackety Hack is the existence of a mature, Smalltalk-based alternative named Squeak.<p>The main issue I have with Squeak is that it's Smalltalk. ;) Smalltalk is a fine language, but I can't get into the whole image thing. I really have nothing new to add to this; my arguments are old and tired.<p>> What exactly does Ruby bring to the table, other than nicer looking websites, bigger egos and curly braces?<p>While we're on this whole ""educate others about language features"" kick, Rubyists almost never use curly braces. One-line blocks are the only time. ;)<p>> Squeak also has Scratch, EToys and Morphic.<p>What Ruby brings to the table is being an actual programming language, rather than a bunch of blocks you put together. I don't mean to demean Scratch, it's done a lot of good, and is a great project in its own way. However, I don't think that 'teaching programming' is a zero-sum, winner take all market.

The original Apple/AT&T iPhone deal was probably a one-off that only happened because (i) Apple had a markedly superior product to anyone else at the time, and (ii) AT&T wanted to increase their market share.  [Happy to be corrected on that latter point - I'm not in the USA, and I'm only going off what I've read online.]  The failure for Apple & Verizon to come to any sort of similar agreement is more likely to be down to Verizon not wanting to give ground, than technical issues like CDMA.  The carriers actively encourage alternative platforms as a means of playing divide-and-conquer against the manufacturers - look at how AT&T is the US launch partner for Windows Mobile 7 rather than one of the other carriers; AT&T clearly don't want to be (or be seen as) locked hand-in-hand with the iPhone.<p>(b) Google won't want Android to be dominant either, as this would bring political threats in terms of antitrust and the risk of being broken up.  It's far better for Android to ""just"" be market-leading or profitable, as this wouldn't attract such negative attention.  And of course, if Google services also appear on other platforms such as iOS, then they're not completely losing out.<p>Have a look at this Asymco post for some more points against a dominant platform: <a href=""http://www.asymco.com/2010/08/19/talk-of-mobile-dominance-is-bunk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asymco.com/2010/08/19/talk-of-mobile-dominance-is...</a>",1290089617

The statement doesn't make much sense as I think the OP just took the quote out of context.<p>A simpler way to visualize what's going on: imagine your trained dog picks up a ball and tosses it up in your hands and you catch it. Now the ball is 1.5 meters higher off the ground than it was before. E = m * g * h = 1 kg (it's a heavy ball, all right?) * 9.8 m/s^2 * 1.5 m = 14.7 J. That's 14.7 J <i>you</i> got for free. But the <i>dog</i> expanded more energy than that to pick up the ball, overcome gravity and air resistance and toss it up. The total system (= you + ball + dog) lost energy and increased entropy.",1290088929

Let them give you a number, and you can then choose to negotiate.  If you're getting 110 now and want to move to 120, but they offer 80, obviously this isn't a good fit, even if they could be convinced to go higher.<p>When a recruiter calls you, demand two things before spending time on an interview (even a phone one).  Salary expecations, and details about the team, like the manager's name, or the specific product, or something.  This will weed out the recruiters who just scan public job listings, and let you deal with the ones who are actually doing their job and playing matchmaker.  It will save you a ton of time and stress.",1290088929

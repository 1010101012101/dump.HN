Even the Shia in Saudi Arabia are treated better than how Iran handles the Ahwaz region.<p>Further, Iran loves fighting wars by proxy for some reason. Hezbollah and the Revolutionary Guard are roaming around Syria like they own it. Hezbollah&#x27;s hold on Lebanese politics is undeniable. And of course, the funding of Houthis in Yemen who hilariously failed to execute an easy coup, the result of which started a full-blown war.<p>The region is in turmoil, and both sides are at fault. I personally believe that the US is entirely aware of the troubled sectarian relations in the region, and is using that as a way to get cheap oil and sell arms, which is a valid strategy.<p>This has to stop. The only lasting solution is dialogue.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahwazi_Arabs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahwazi_Arabs</a>",1448053199

One of his major influences is a cross-section of experience between living in Algeria and being bifurcated with the west. His bleed out on the screen, seems more jaded than informative. At the very least he&#x27;s sloppy in respecting certain parts of the Saudi national, with terms like Wahhabi which by all accounts is derogatory. Which through admission, I&#x27;m a white middle class IT professional living in the Rust Best, and the subtle nature of his cantor is a bit tasteless in my opinion. However, Saudi Arabia is by all measures secular and demands it be, because of its place in the world - it&#x27;s the holder of the great sites of Islam, playing host to the yearly travel of millions of pilgrims of the Islamic faith.

My concern with pigeons is they might not have enough of the abstract/critical thinking abilities the other 3 bird species have. I could be underestimating them, but I&#x27;d probably put my bets on crows figuring it out before a pigeon. Though crows, jays and parrots are also smart enough to get bored after a while, so they might not be up to the task<p>New Caledonia Crows are smart enough to use &quot;meta tools&quot; where the tool they&#x27;re using is only a step towards their end goal. They&#x27;ve been observed using smaller sticks to reach for a larger stick that will allow them to reach a piece of food. Crows (in general) also have awesome memories and will remember the faces of people who were mean or nice to them years later while also passing it on to their offspring (who have never seen this person before).<p>In a lab study, jays were shown to cache food if they knew they won&#x27;t find food early in the morning the next day. If they knew they have a meal waiting for them the next day, they would cache less or not at all.<p>I know there&#x27;s parrots that have been trained to open up locked boxes where certain randomly assigned locks are redundant.

And the worst part is Saudi Arabia is us closest ally after Israel,what was the last time us puts hard sanction against Saudi Arabia because of their human right issue.what was last time us decrease relationship because of human right.as Iranian I only can say this to west politicians: go fuck yourself.<p>This was my old cm:<p>Am pretty angry about what is going on in world , so if you felt insulted , I am so sorry , and You should understand I don&#x27;t want to insult you or any other person specifically,But I want insult Ideologies pretty badly.<p>As person who LIVES in heart of middle east (Iran) and I have seen shia militant from very close(I know people who works in IRGC),You are completely and pure wrong , do you know what would generate another generation of terrorist ? another invasion. I am atheist and liberal with a little being gay,I am not gay , but sometime things go wrong - and believe me these are pretty dangerous thing to be in Iran and would get me killed, without doubt - but I can realize the only thing will give terrorist another opportunity is invasion of a country in middle east. This is not your fucking war.This was not west fucking war at all. They shouldn&#x27;t come here in any circumstance.You know what ? because Paris like terrorism act will happen again and again and again. West should understand they were wrong all the time. What the fuck are you doing in middle east ? You know what ? no body more than me would be glad to live in secular community with secular government, but it seems politician in west do not realize , being in middle east is equal to raising radical movement against them. YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND , MIDDLE EAST SHOULD FIGHT FOR ITSELF, EVEN IF ISIS KILL ALL OF US, this is not your fucking war.I do not remember reading if any alien did help west during the renaissance. Society should grow.<p>PLEASE , do for humanity a favor , understand militarism is equal to terrorism. I was talking with one idiot yesterday , and he mentioned I do not believe France invade Iraq. Yes your are right idiot . France did not . but west did . These fucking killers in middle east , do not see countries , they see Islam against West.<p>Do you know who fights in Iran against mullah&#x27;s ? Christians ? Are you kidding me, mujaheddin khalgh ? Those fucking traitors, no way.<p>Academia fights against mullah&#x27;s, science fights, liberal people fighting against mullah&#x27;s more effective than any other person in whole revolution history.This regime is almost unbeatable in political sense- because they have money and manpower and oil- but do you know they are seeing liberals in their nightmare. They even don&#x27;t care about West invasion against Iran(some stupid person like G.W Bush may even consider that option).Because at the end they know the can manage harm West military pretty badly. Worse than maybe Vietnam war.BUT THEY CANNOT FIGHT WITH INTERNET, WITH TOR, WITH STUDENTS who USE TOR.\nGive them internet , provide them satellite , Facebook/twitter/YouTube/porn , Show them fucking beautiful women in Texas(with respect to women, I just want show sexual incentives), show them there is no need to kill so many people to get those woman , you can fuck like heaven in earth without killing people. And BOOOOOM this is the sound of explosion of foundation of religion.<p>Ruin their stupid culture , and then you are going to see middle is will revive. and turn to into secular place.<p>and Do you know who is supporting ISIS ? Which countries? I would suspect Saudi Arabia ( the US closest ally after Israel in middle east).Can you fucking believe it ? This is not double standard. This is fucking fraud against humanity.At the end we all know , non of the west&#x27;s politician&#x27;s give fucking flying shit about terrorism in middle east. If they did , They weren&#x27;t this double standard&#x27;ed against corrupted (I would say most corrupted regime in whole world) regime in Saudi Arabia.What was last time you checked women condition in Saudi Arabia.And why the hell us have this much relation ship with country which behead people like candy. This is what I mean when I am saying double standard.<p>p.s. if you felt I insult you , I am so sorry , I was talking broadly than talking with you.I hope respectively, you understand there was something HUGE wrong with west policy in middle east.",1448050492

Steve does seem very accomplished, that&#x27;s quite a blog and set of projects he&#x27;s got going on there.<p>If you just set out to accomplish things though, you&#x27;ll be surprised at how much you can complete,<p>Also exercise (he does it through dancing it seems), you get a lot of energy from that.<p>He&#x27;s likely bilingual (or tri, or quad, or more) since he&#x27;s from Iceland. That&#x27;s super healthy. And he&#x27;s clearly exercising all the areas of his brain by playing music, writing, engineering, and dancing.<p>Probably doesn&#x27;t spend <i>too</i> much time reading the news (it&#x27;s easy to get lost in the rabbit hole that is reddit or hackernews sometimes), probably doesn&#x27;t spend <i>too</i> much time binge watching things, <i>probably</i> doesn&#x27;t party <i>too</i> hard <i>too</i> often. That&#x27;s very different from assuming he never does any of those activities, it&#x27;s probably just not his de facto constant.<p>So I guess, and this is just an educated guess based on what I can see from him and my own personal experiences, my recommendation to you (and you didn&#x27;t ask for my advice I know!) would be to limit the amount of time you spend doing things which are easy (reddit, hackernews, reading the news, watching TV), make sure to exercise, make sure to do something creative, and set singular goals for yourself (This week I want to write a blog post, my next goal is to develop a small program to do X). Finally, as you grow and continue to develop healthier habits it gets easier and easier to continue.<p>So if you spend one week making sure to work towards your current singular goal, you&#x27;re more likely to do so the next week.<p>Also, starting is always the hardest part. Sometimes it&#x27;s as simple as just opening the computer, closing the browser, and starting to futz around with some code. It takes about ten or fifteen minutes for me and then I&#x27;m in there like swim wear! And I can keep going for quite some time.

You may not get rich on all of them, but each small success will build upon itself.<p>Whether it is profitable or not depends on many factors, but the sum of those factors is what did it cost you to develop the software and what does it cost you to maintain it. Does the software require multiple developers to maintain or a call center to support?<p>As for features/languages. Start small and grow from there. Listen to your users and what they want. Release quickly and often. It&#x27;s always easier to add features than to be in a constant state of development. For the language, simple, choose what you are most comfortable with.

7317453,comment,7312442,7317401,6,0,Fomite,,,"I was being charitable to your example, because generally speaking there <i>are no</i> observational studies done before a drug is put up for approval - that&#x27;s not how the approval pipeline works. The closest I can come up to your example is the occasional off-label use of a drug for some other condition, but the reports from those are largely small n studies. That&#x27;s entirely different from a series of studies based on NHANES.<p>Beyond that, in an intentional randomized trial, rather than the &#x27;happy accident&#x27; like the Oregon study, the actual control is not &#x27;Nothing&#x27; but the medically indicated standard of care. Studies are often <i>required</i> to provide medical care, education, etc. to their participants. I cannot imagine a study managing to get &quot;We deny a bunch of folks health insurance&quot; by an IRB unless it was an externally forced process, like the Oregon study.<p>Your insult about not understanding statistics, in addition to being off-base, is rather spurious. This isn&#x27;t a statistical question, it&#x27;s a public health ethics question. Statistics doesn&#x27;t really come into whether or not &quot;Keep a bunch of people from accessing healthcare&quot; will get nailed by an approval board.<p>Also, the FDA often does take observational evidence into account, especially when expanding things like what age range a drug is medically indicated for.",1393567139

Unless you can independently verify that the keys you&#x27;re getting from Apple belong to the intended recipient, the system doesn&#x27;t work.  You don&#x27;t even have to add a key to the pool, you simply replace a key in the pool with a key generated by Apple, and when the message arrives on the server, it&#x27;s decrypted and sent to anyone at all, and then re-encrypted with the recipient&#x27;s key and sent along as normal.  Even signatures aren&#x27;t really a barrier in this case, since Apple can MITM your public key (used to verify the signature) to the recipient, as well.<p>Any crypto system whose security is predicated on a trusted server might as well be compromised.

7317434,comment,7312475,7312620,4,0,vitd,,,">But working &quot;on the Internet&quot; means you&#x27;re also comparing yourself to the best, brightest, and driven.<p>This reminds me of something that happened to me a few years ago. My spouse and I bought a condo in a very expensive area of a big city. We realized we were very lucky to have stock options that were worth real money to sell and pay for a downpayment on the place. I felt a little like we were &quot;cheaters&quot; or &quot;fakers&quot; because the other people in the building seemed so successful. It felt like we hadn&#x27;t &quot;earned&quot; the money since it was pretty much luck getting the options at the right time.<p>The guy above us in his 50s had his own business - some lighting stores or something. The lady next to us was about our age (late 30&#x27;s at the time) and was an event planner and had done the work for some famous awards show recently. The couple below us were retired, and the husband had been a highly-paid salesman. etc.<p>A few months in, we learn that the guy above us doesn&#x27;t actually own his condo. It&#x27;s owned by a trust set up by his family. The lady next door co-owns it with her father who paid for most it. The couple downstairs actually did own theirs the &quot;normal&quot; way, but they seemed like the only ones in the building. It was really eye-opening. We were no less successful or lucky than the other people in the building. Most of them had &quot;cheated&quot; in some way, too, and comparing ourselves to them in that way was pointless. Did I work any less hard than the lighting guy or the event planner? Hell no! Did they &quot;earn&quot; their condos any more than me? Not at all. They were no more or less successful than us or anyone else in the building, it just looked that way at first.",1393566685

A tl;dr; is that Hulu Japan is being acquired by Nippon TV.<p>It&#x27;s a very interesting move as it may indicate that Japanese networks are starting to push more streaming services in the country. Something that wasn&#x27;t the case two years ago [1]. I speculate that this is partly due to Amazon recently releasing instant video in Japan [2]. I&#x27;m also wondering if both of these moves indicate that Netflix is actively working to expand into Japan with Nippon TV wanting to not fall behind. It&#x27;ll also be interesting to see if other streaming services start popping up and becoming more popular for things like music (Japan is still the land of CDs with regards to this).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/15/3628376/japan-digital-content-ecosystem-hulu-country-future"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/15/3628376/japan-digital-con...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/27/5151312/amazon-instant-video-now-available-in-japan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/27/5151312/amazon-instant-vi...</a>",1393566657

Never heard of that term until The Sopranos came along. Interesting fact - in most states, ambulance costs, private or otherwise, are regulated, and must be registered - and approved - by the DOH EMS and Trauma department. This is due to the fact that very many, if not most, of the people who receive this service have only &quot;implicitly consented&quot; to it.<p>- you&#x27;re right, we don&#x27;t care about insurance - nor do the docs we work with.<p>- Your ex-gf swore the Hippocratic Oath?

This follows from the fact that the stock market is (for these purposes) a zero sum game.<p>The error in your argument is that (1) is false.  You say &quot;you just call your broker and ask to buy at the market price&quot;.  But if every market participant was like that, then the order books wouldn&#x27;t match and the market would break down.  There must be <i>some</i> participants who are price elastic.  And these are precisely the people whose decisions are effected on the margin, that is, the people who you cause to buy/sell when you engage in insider trading.<p>So when I buy shares with inside information (say I know the price will rise), I cause the price to rise by a tiny amount, and induce some people to sell who wouldn&#x27;t have.  Since these people wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have sold, they lose money from my actions.<p>It is true that insider trading provides information to the market place, and so it is beneficial in that sense.  However, it also creates asymmetric information and so harms liquidity.  While there is always asymmetric information (I own stocks through my 401k, but I have no idea what MSFT should be worth), insider information is an especially extreme kind, and therefore especially harmful to liquidity.",1393564688

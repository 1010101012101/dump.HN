If that someone is doing something illegal, you're well on your way to getting in trouble. Especially if most of the activity in the network is illegal, then it'll be hard to argue that you didn't know what could happen. It's pretty much what killed Napster, although in that case it was the company that ran the network that got shut down.<p>I suppose it'll have to be a serious problem for someone to make the effort of finding and decoding the data, but I don't doubt that sooner or later someone will decide that it's worth it.<p>If there's going to be processing of the data, and not just storage, the local node will need to have access to the encryption keys. That should make the work of the investigator easier. With enough cunning trickery it'll probably be hard to find them, but with access to the hardware I have no doubt that it's doable.<p>Hm. So the work needs to be done in a virtual machine that is given access to a local file storage and the freeserve (let's call it that, sounds nice) network. The vm needs to query the network for tasks to be performed, download the data for the task, process it, and upload the result.. Should be a fun project to design it.<p>Fairly simple. Except for all the technical and legal problems :)",1228381579

I guess it's not so different after all, I was thinking fresh programmers're getting $70k/year after taxes.<p>In my experience (I'm still in univ. but got some offers from companies), we will get base salary: $2k ~ 2.5k/month after taxes etc, plus apartment(simple one) and transport fee. The yearly bonus is 5 times of base salary, but usually we get only 4 times. This is from fairly big Japanese company, slightly lower than SONY or HONDA.\nThe job being talked is core software development at company's main business. Too bad we don't have 401k plan like in other countries.<p>I went to Deutsche Bank last year, and it's alot different. \nWe'll get $64k/year after tax, almost no yearly bonus\nand small allowance for apartment.

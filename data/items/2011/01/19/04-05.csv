2118684,comment,2116437,2117792,0,0,danudey,,,"I would argue that there is a reason why Samsung, LG, Motorola, et al cannot follow this model – Apple is a player in the high end of the mobile market. They come out with a new phone once a year, and it's hotly anticipated because in most (if not all) respects the new phone will be the most impressive phone on the market. Couple that with new OS features, and it creates quite a buzz.<p>If Samsung (for example) just made one phone a year, they'd lose market share because it would only be 'the latest thing' for a few weeks until someone else came out with an Android phone. Even if Samsung's product life cycle comes in one-year intervals, the rest of the Android community is much faster, and carriers will be glad to push the latest new phone with the latest whiz-bang features.<p>In order for Samsung to really compete, they would have to make a high-end, cutting-edge phone, comparable in build quality, features, and software to the iPhone. It would have to stand head and shoulders above the sea of mediocre Android handsets, and stay there for quite a while. It would need to be different enough from the rest that it was a clear winner, the Android phone to own this year. This would have to be said about the hardware and the software.<p>There are two problems here. Samsung isn't a software company, so their modifications to Android are superficial at best and mostly take the form of different UIs, as well as the bundled carrier apps that they have to agree to in order to get a carrier's full support. Samsung can't make a truly great smartphone because they're shipping the same thing everyone else is shipping – the latest Android build, with a different coat of paint.<p>There's also the hardware end. Apple knows that they're going to sell massive numbers of phones (according to the earnings call today, they're selling them as fast as they're making them, which I believe). They can pre-buy billions of dollars worth of components ahead of time to get preferential pricing and treatment. Their competitors can't match them because they simply cannot get the same hardware for the same price, and so their margins end up slimmer and they have to sell more units to recoup their costs.<p>Amusingly, Samsung is one of the companies Apple has preferential deals with (for Flash memory), and if I recall correctly, LG is another one (for LCD panels, not likely for mobile though).<p>So in order for Samsung to make the exact same hardware as Apple, they would have to sell it for more, in larger volumes, with lower margins, which would require betting big on one new product and impressing everyone. It would also require doing something new and innovative with Android, which is difficult because Google and Apple are both doing new and innovative things with their respective OSes so it would be difficult for Samsung to get ahead of either one.<p>Even assuming they did all that, they're still up against iOS's established mind share. Everyone's heard of the iPhone, and a lot of people want it. They want the apps, the TV shows, the movies, the music. Each step Apple has taken has built upon the successes of the last - first iTunes, then the iPod, then the iTunes Store, then movies and TV shows, then the iPhone, then the app store, and then the iPad. Samsung can't duplicate the entire stack, and they can't piece it together from existing offerings in a way that other providers (or end users) couldn't do. Even if they <i>did</i> manage that, they wouldn't be taking nearly as much of the profits from all of those services as Apple does with its own stack.<p>There's no way for Samsung (or the other providers) to differentiate themselves significantly. In consumers' minds, there's 'Blackberry', 'iPhone' and 'neither', and establishing a totally new category just for one phone based off of the same software as most of the smartphones in the 'neither' category isn't feasible; supporting it for two years afterward is impossible.<p>It's much more practical for Samsung to ship a new, slightly-better-than-the-rest phone every six months and just catch their share of the little fish, instead of trying to catch the big fish and risk getting hurt.",1295413082

That Rails devs should keep up with Rails 3. That Javascript devs should keep up with Node.js and the plethora or new libraries/frameworks coming out. Sure you might know a gazillion languages, but the only real requirement is to keep up with the developments of the technologies you need NOW.<p>I agree that no developer should be expected to know everything, nevertheless he/she should be able to pick up anything fast and easy. It is my firm belief that people should be paid by the value they provide, instead of the technologies they're well versed in.<p>On another note, I'm by no means a genius rocket scientist turned developer, but in the last 6 years I went from implementing complex E-Commerce Java backends, to front end development and design, to Php app dev, back to Java, to Rails webapps, to system administration and some Python dev, to (right now) Asp MVC and C# dev. I've been using Visual Studio (which I had never used) in a virtual machine running Windows (which I last used when XP came out circa late 2001), and I was productive within the first 2 or 3 days from when I started.

However, after anyone has lived with a powerful Rotary engine for a while, the sound of a tuned Rotary immediately pricks the ears. Noise is going to be one of the by-products of a powerful electric engine - witness electric trains like the TGV for that - so I can see the high-powered whine becoming the mark of a high-powered electric, and young enthusiasts will come up with kits to increase the sound, just as they have with V8's, Rotaries, Turbos and every other type of engine tech.",1295412354

Neither had ever mentioned such a thing beforehand.  A few manufacturers were dabbling with hybrid tech in some of their cars, but an all-electric sports car was not on the radar at all.  Now every motor show has a major manufacturer either displaying an all-electric or hybrid-drive system.  The gas turbine hybrid Jag was an awesome concept car.  It's just great to see new thinking, and I give Tesla the credit for kicking the baggage of electric cars to the kerb.  Building a sports car first was inspired just for the PR value.<p>BMW and Mercedes are scrambling to catch up with their electric tech.  Being the engineering giants that both companies are, they will arrive later to the party, but what they produce will be properly good.  I've read up on some of the tech BMW is researching for electric vehicles, and it's very promising.  I believe the first models will be out in 2013, albeit in a small car format rather than a sports car.  I guess we'll find out.",1295411953

Accountants <i>are not bookkeeepers</i>.<p>> By modelling a company as a complex information network, the in- and out-flows of each part of the business will act as signals and semaphores revealing reckless spending, potential embezzlement, or unsuccessful ventures. Collecting information allows for an empirical, scientific approach to management, based on actual performance, and backed up by numbers.<p>This <i>is</i> what accountants do. But the world is filled with ambiguity and unusual corner cases. Accountants organise all the monetary relationships of a business into a hierarchy, and like any hierarchy, it has annoying things that could fit into one of several places.<p>Part of accounting is to identify these anomalies as they emerge (and given the indefinite complexity of the economic world, they emerge constantly) and to come to a consensus on them. This is the source of the GAAP and IASB standards. This is necessary so that accountants can communicate information to each other in an honest, comparable fashion.<p>It is a profound and common mistake of software types to say: ""that's stupid. That's simple. I could reinvent that, 100x better, in a weekend!""<p>Well good luck with that. (Sometimes they're right.

Pushing technology forward in an area where it's been stagnant for a while, getting attention and attempting to change things.  I would've thought this type of thing would be embraced rather than discarded.",1295410207

In this case, I added a location feature because not everyone is in a position to donate money to a cause they really want to help with, but they are willing to help in other ways.<p>My inspiration for this project came when traveling across the country last year and stumbled on this orphanage in Michigan that needed help building a playground for their kids. No one knew of their plight since they are such a small organization and couldn't raise the money for it. I didn't have the money either, but my friends and I were willing to physically build the play ground for them. I think with 'causes' these days, people want to help, but not everyone can help financially. Some people are able to donate 'hours' of physical labor or even specific expertise...and that's what I am trying to achieve here.<p>Would appreciate feedback as to how to make the platform better achieve its goals.

Knowing Apple, I also have a feeling they'll come up with some innovative solutions to the no-number-pad problem.<p>Some ideas:<p>- Automatically complete phone numbers, as you dial them<p>- Spotlight-type search for contacts.  I.e, I dial ""442"" and the phone displays all contacts with 442 in the number, address, etc.  I could then press the contact I want to call.<p>- Better voice recognition technology.  For example, if I say ""Call Mike,"" the phone displays the top 3 contacts it thinks match my request, I then confirm the default choice or select one out of the list.  Maybe the phone even learns?<p>Obviously, this is all speculation.  But the point is, it should be easy to come up with solutions to this problem that actually make the phone easier to use.

16427,comment,16409,16409,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"Loved this point:<p>""The thing is, a lot of those difficult problems are irrelevant for 99% of products. For example, ""real"" databases can handle transactions that are too large to fit in memory. That was probably a really important feature in 1980. Today, you can buy a computer with 32GB of memory for around $5000. How many GB transactions do you suppose Twitter performs? My guess is zero -- I suspect that their average transaction size is closer to 0.0000002 GB (messages are limited to 140 characters).""",1177443236

16422,comment,16234,16320,0,0,nostrademons,,,"So, I was talking with my cofounder, and we came up with Bootstrapacitor.com.  It has ""bootstrap"" in the name and also has the capacitor connotations of storing energy and letting it build up until it escapes like a lightning bolt.  Also, there're tons of flux-capacitor jokes we could include (we - meaning the site users - are collectively inventing the future, after all), and the flux capacitor is even shaped like a Y!<p>What do you think?",1177442791

Initially I'll just need assistance with incorporating and drafting an IP release statement from my current employer, but I'd like to establish a long term relationship for future legal advice. So for this reason I'd prefer someone who has had experience dealing with tech startups specifically.<p>We'd like someone who is good but our limited funding wont allow for a firm who charges a lot.. I know, I know, these goals are mutually exclusive but I was hoping someone on this forum might have some recommendations.<p>Any general lawyer-searching advice is also appreciated. I know many here have been through this process..<p>Please feel free to contact me off list at jsjenkins168 (at) gmail.com too. Thanks.

I'm pretty enamored with rails but just last week I wrote a ruby script for a client to pull some stats out of apache logs and it took forever to run so I'm sympathetic to a lot of his arguments. <p>His mild attempt at the end to give rails its due suggests it's less black and white than he paints it. There's good reason to have both languages in your toolbox. ",1177442671

Most databases are still storing my name using the same techniques that they did 15 or more years ago -- they seek the disk head to some specific location and then read or write my name to that location. These databases rely on the one operation that DID NOT dramatically improve in the past 15 years! They still perform like it's 1991.""<p>I don't think PostgreSQL is the only database that uses write-ahead logging.",1177441945

Just how many years it took Haskell to convince people that it's something more than an obscure research project?<p>Certainly, the language would benefit greatly from much higher number of libraries, for example, and their lack can be a serious setback for larger projects. On the other hand the language itself includes many sophisticated, impressive features that help with programming such projects - one tiny example is a very nice module system, closer in essence (I think) to that of OCaml than to that of Python and another is an object system, which is well thought out, easy to use and really powerful.<p>So, while Racket is nowhere near Common Lisp (I really hope you used 'CL' as abbreviation for Common List and not Clojure :)) in industrial usage, I believe that it is (or will be shortly) ready for it's chance in the real world.

Under certain conditions, 60hz (think florescent lighting) can be enough that your eyes won't notice a flicker. (your eyes hold a residual for some period of time, and you never see the darkenss). But if you are flashing a series of super-crisp photos, your eye is much more likely to pick up on stuttering because each photo has just as much light.<p>And then, if you have some action sequence in a movie where parts of the scene are really bright and fast-motion, and others are dim, the minimum amount of frames per second you need to create a 'perfect' experience for the eye is anybodies guess.

5039442,comment,5038598,5038598,26,0,tptacek,,,"Notes:<p>* Strong recommend on the Fibrox knife. If you don't already have a serious knife, don't buy one; get the Fibrox and use it for awhile. You may never want another knife, and if you ever do, you'll have a very good idea what you're looking for. Beware of knives: they're Veblen goods.<p>* Don't get the expensive butcher block board. Actively avoid it. If you feel like arguing about this, you're not the reader this note targets; everyone else, trust me that the butcher block board is a lot of maintenance for not a lot of practical difference. Plastic and laminate boards work great, are cheap, and you can throw them in the dishwasher.<p>* Get two boards of different colors and designate one for meat. This minimizes accidental cross-contamination and also makes it easier to handle multiple prep steps since a board that was used for carrots and onions can just be rinsed off to reuse for shallots or garlic.<p>* I'd recommend against the knife sharpener. It's hard and a little time consuming to do a good job sharpening knives, and if you're not ready to commit to learning how, you're better off bringing your knives in every month or so; it takes just 2 minutes for a shop to do it. You probably won't sharpen your own knives even if you buy the equipment, but having it, you'll convince yourself you don't need to have your knives sharpened professionally. Bad sharpeners can also mess up your knives.<p>* Strong disagree on ""just get 10 piece set"" of pots/pans. You need a large sautee, a saucier (which will double as rice and veg cooking), a soup pot, and a _small_ nonstick omelette pan, and nothing else. Except for the omelette pan, which you'll be replacing every year or so, the quality of your pans will matter a lot. I like All-Clad, like everyone else.<p>* If you want to optimize a little, get a Lodge Enamelled Dutch Oven and use it for soup and also braises.<p>* Get the cheapest All-Clad on offer. All-Clad's multiple lines are mostly about price discrimination.<p>* Unless you eat smoothies, most people will use their Kitchenaid Mixer more than they'll use any blender. You can safely skip the blender! People geek out on blenders, and, what's more tricky, venders <i>aren't</i> Veblen goods; their performance really does scale with their price. Which means you'll easily be convinced to drop a lot of money on a blender. If you're unsure whether you want to allocate a lot of dollars to a Vitamix (we love ours, but...), get an immersion (""stick"") blender instead. They're very cheap and they'll do most of the culinary things you'd do with the stand blender.<p>* Again regarding mixers: there is only one brand. You want a Kitchenaid.<p>* If you're not going to bake, you can skip the mixer.<p>* If you get a stick blender, you can get one with attachments and skip the hand mixer.<p>* Nerds need slow cookers. Here again I disagree with Matt. Normal people can get away with not having a crock pot, but if you're looking to set up a kitchen that will get you cooking more and eating In-N-Out less, you need the crock pot. They're cheap, and more importantly, they allow you to queue up a meal in the morning and come home to it done.<p>* Hard to disagree with Matt on the utilities. You need a scale. You need a stack of light metal mixing bowls (do not waste time and money on heavy mixing bowls). Microplanes are great. You want a box grater. You want a thermometer. If you're making room in your budget for optimization: the Thermapen is <i>totally</i> worth it. Nobody I know who has one fails to wax poetical about them. I rarely use the rolling pin. I disagree about the silicone tongs; get all-metal ones, but get a good pair. Matt didn't say ""fish spatula"" but trust me on this, you'll use it <i>all the time</i>. If you didn't know you needed a good whisk I don't know how I can help you.<p>Finally:<p>One thing Matt didn't list here that has more or less changed my life: go to Amazon and get the largest bulk plastic deli cup box they'll sell you. Deli cups are amazing. You need deli cups. I don't mean ""you need 1 or 2 deli cups"". I mean you need a stack of 60 somewhere in your kitchen, and another 300 or so in a closet.<p>Stab at a true minimum viable kitchen (there are other minimal configurations):<p>- Cuisinart 3qt sautee ($52)<p>- Large pot ($25, Cuisinart)<p>- Small cheap nonstick omelette pan ($20, Cuisinart)<p>- Fibrox chef's knife ($26)<p>- Metal fish spatula ($12, OXO)<p>- 2 plastic cutting boards ($30 for 2, generic)<p>- 2 light metal mixing bowls ($20 for 2, generic)<p>- 1 4-cup pyrex measuring cup ($10)<p>- Balloon whisk ($10, OXO)<p>- Large wooden spoon ($5, Calphalon)<p>- Large slotted spoon ($10, OXO)<p>- Tbsp/tsp measuring spoon ($3, generic)<p>- Stick blender ($45, Cuisinart, w/ whisk)<p>- Pepper grinder ($10, generic)<p>- Thermometer ($20, generic)<p>- Scale ($20, generic)<p>Total: $305",1357848781

Wok Fast teaches a technique that works pretty well for cooking meat + vegetable dishes. I'm writing this from memory, so it might be off by a bit, but the key is to cook at the most two cups of ingredients at a time.<p>1. Wait until the wok surface is hot enough to vaporize a sprinkling of water instantly.<p>2. Add the oil + onions and/or garlic and stir fry for 30 seconds. Coat the wok with the oil as you do this.<p>3. Add the meat, let it sit on the wok until it is seared (at which point it will ""unstick"" from the wok) and stir fry about two minutes. Remove the meat, which is not yet fully cooked, and set it aside.<p>4. Wait for the wok to heat up again, but be careful about using the water droplet technique as that can cause the oil to splash. Add the vegetables and stir fry until they brighten, about two minutes.<p>5. If the wok is still pretty hot at this point you can just add the meat and cook another two minutes, then add the sauce and cook a final two minutes. If it seems like it isn't hot enough, remove the vegetables and let it heat up a bit before adding everything.<p>It's definitely more effort than just being able to add the meat, stir fry, then add the vegetables, but it does work, and only takes 8-10 minutes for meat + vegetables. If you are cooking only vegetables, the water doesn't need to instantly vaporize -- it should sit for about 2 or 3 seconds before vaporizing.<p>As I said, I'm recalling this from memory and I don't generally cook meat, so the instructions might be off (please don't eat undercooked meat!) But what I wanted to convey was that I found it possible to stir fry for two even with a low end electric stove. Maybe there are some stoves even worse than what I had, though! :)",1357848768

So it's pretty straightforward. We just eat produce at home and an occasional hot meal out. Every meal at home is either fresh fruit or a salad. (I haven't eaten anything other than fruit before noon for 25 years.) We have lots of nuts & seeds, cereals, snacks, and many wonderful things in our fridge.<p>We eat out at restaurants several times per week and zero in on our favorites. (Living in Miami, we'll probably run out of fantastic options in about 30 years.) Most of the places we go serve food far better than what we could or would want to prepare and most definitely satisfy our ""foodie"" desires. Miami also offers many foods we would have never even dreamed about.<p>This was a nice post for beginning foodies (Thank you, Matt), but these days, MV<anythings> asymphtotically approach zero. In most places, you really can eat lots of delicious and healthy food without all that stuff.<p>(By the way, anyone need a stove, range, or microwave with 0 miles on them?)",1357848055

That said I keep my room flooded with light so as to not strain my eyes trying to look at a screen or read in the dark.

5039366,comment,5038598,5039074,2,0,r888888888,,,"I feel that cast iron pans are overrated. Stainless steel is easier to clean, lets you build fond, lets you cook acidic pan sauces, and are lighter so you can be more aggressive about pan flipping. The only advantage cast iron has is heat retention and there are few cases where that's useful (like deep frying for example, or baking bread). Iron is actually a relatively poor conductor of heat also and a good tri-ply pan will heat up faster.<p>Cast iron dutch ovens are another story because you will frequently use them in ovens where the heat retention properties are useful.",1357848034

Since the US population was already significantly more heterogenous in 1950, why didn't that heterogeneity show through in the life-expectancy data for 1950?",1357848029

By this very fact, and having been in existance for longer, the scope of things Google works on is much larger. On the other hand, FB has a much sharper focus on impact: self-driving cars simply won't get worked on because there isn't enough people and more pressing work needed to be done. This is a matter of taste, and I preferred FB here.<p>Second, having a family, I was concerned about work-life balance. To my friends to worked at Google, it was now a 9-5 job. At FB all-night hackathons are still very much a part of the culture, however there are lots of people with families there now (especially in Seattle). My FB friends had lives outside of work but enjoyed what they were doing and worked very hard. On the benefits side, FB offers a week more of vacation and 4 months of parental leave. In all, I give Google the edge in work-life balance.<p>Third, culture was very important to me. I felt that there was a sense of complacency amongst a large minority of Googlers. They worked on large, established products making incremental improvements. At Facebook, I met lots of people fired up about the V1 projects they were working on. If your entrepreneurial like myself, you might prefer the Facebook culture.<p>Fourth, Google tried to match me up with a team before my start date. Facebook matches employees with teams after a 6-week bootcamp. I liked the latter approach, because I could really get to know teams before I joined.<p>I joined Facebook last week, and my first impressions have backed up my intuition.",1353868226

It's not cool to say you're a Java developer, but most of the corporate world runs on it, even if no one admits to be the person developing those applications.<p>There were even a few projects where the cool languages (we're moving from a Node.js platform to something that's more maintainable) had failed and were being replaced.  I'm not sure this is Node's fault (you can get this with any language if the architect and/or lead don't know what they're doing) but it does say something about Java.<p>At JavaOne this year, there were a lot of great sessions and a lot of optimism about where the next set of specifications were headed.  I for one fell back in love with Java through a combination of JEE6 and GWT.  It's so much easier to be a developer than it used to be.  I will admit that I love Python and Coffeescript too, but I don't generally write large projects in either one.<p>So I don't expect Java to lose popularity more than a few spots ... it's entirely possible that Java is now ""well known"" (at least by the StackOverflow measure) and just doesn't have as many unanswered questions.  In any case, I expect it to be around a while, When Y3K rolls around it won't be the Cobol programmers in demand - it will be those of us who know Java inside and out.",1353867081

4828738,comment,4828431,4828431,31,0,cletus,,,"For me this post read like it was skirting around the issue. I have an enormous amount of respect for Fred Wilson but you have to remember that when a VC writes something, it's not only what they think; they're doing it for a reason.<p>Take Chris Dixon's post [1] as an example. He's now a VC. He wants to diminish the stigma around talent acquisitions. Why? Because that's how VCs get paid in the vast majority of cases. Those big wins when a company goes public are pretty rare. Big acquisitions? Also relatively rare. Most are 1x-5x ""bailouts"" I would guess.<p>Paul Graham's most recent essay [2] was excellent but remember this site exists as a funnel for YC finding teams and companies to invest in.<p>So, to address Fred's points:<p>> 1) the consumer web has matured<p>This is a strange argument. It wasn't mature 2 years ago? 3? Twitter and Pinterest (which he mentions) did get a ""standing start"".<p>> 2) the consumer is moving from desktop/web to mobile/app<p>The trend in recent years has been for startup costs to be going down. $50,000 can buy you a lot of Web development and hosting these days. Labour costs (engineers) are probably going up. Everything else is <i>much</i> cheaper.<p>Mobile seems to buck this trend. I imagine the cost of developing a Web site plus apps for Android and iOS is significantly more expensive. Well it must be by definition because you still need the Web site (in most cases). It's partly why people will target one platform first (typically iOS).<p>> 3) the momentum/late stage investors have moved from consumer to enterprise<p>This is a symptom and it seems to be the elephant in the room that Fred isn't mentioning: the consumer Web space is crowded.<p>To draw from PG's essay, enterprise has both the ""schlep"" and ""unsexy"" factors going for it and it's an area that, depending your market, can be hard to penetrate but also far easier to get paying customers. It's hard to extract money from consumers except for three things: games, advertising and, to a certain extent, hardware.<p>I've thought for at least 2-3 years that if I were to start a startup it'd be somewhere in enterprise space. The fact that VC funding is, according to Fred, going there too just confirms that.<p>> But it is a tougher time for early stage consumer internet companies than I have seen since the 2001-2004 time frame.<p>This to me was the strangest point of all. 2001-2004 were on the whole terrible. But it's still way cheaper now making bootstrapping just that much more viable than it ever was 10 years ago.<p>To me this is just more evidence that we're <i>not</i> in a bubble because the VC ""market"" is acting quite rationally. For every Instagram there are a hundred failures and many more acqui-bailouts. Yet many people--too many people (IMHO)--are working on shit that just doesn't matter (""it's a social network... for cats!"" as the cliche goes) in a very crowded space and most are going to be disappointed.<p>What I believe Fred is doing here is signalling that he (and by extension USV) are interested in non-consumer startups. They don't want to come out and say ""we're not interested in consumer startups"" as that'll put them at a disadvantage when it comes to funding hot startups/teams.<p>I agree: enterprise and even infrastructure (particularly cloud-related infrastructure) seem to have stronger opportunities than consumer web (IMHO).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4825418"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4825418</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4806852"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4806852</a>",1353866872

Then, by writing a lot you will be able to put these new techniques to use and figure out what works best with your particular approach to writing. I learned to write effective fiction and poetry (I've been published in literary magazines and been invited to read at several events) by close-reading all my inspirations and then practicing writing in their style.

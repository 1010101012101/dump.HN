118697,comment,118355,118514,0,0,rtf,,,"The other way to look at it is that Lua has a simple enough binding interface that it's like a ""high-level layer on top of C."" So you can write C, or write Lua, and slop things around between them as necessary, run multiple interpreters, whatever you feel like.<p>Python is more focused on extending the language as a singular entity, and (not having actually written extensions) it seems to have more strenuous requirements.<p>Right now I'm focused on haXe, though, cause with that language, you get several platform options, including a Lua-like interpreter(Neko).",1203396997

118683,comment,118596,118660,0,0,ALee,,,"Really Xobni and Loopt are probably the most ballsy companies YC has ever funded. They share a lot of characteristics:<p>1) Seeing something powerful in contextual data surrounding phones and mail (perhaps the two most basic forms of communication ever).\n2) Both are part of the Microsoft Accelerator Program- The two of them also use Microsoft technology- .NET and Outlook (C#, I think). For some this may go against them.\n3) Both have founders that are very nice guys (but you definitely wouldn't want to compete against them).\n4) Both are VC-backed and they never sold out earlier like other YC companies, which just shows their relative tolerance of risk.",1203395356

Occasionally I find myself staring down the barrel of a particularly thorny problem; the initial responses and challenges to the problem listed in the diagram are spot-on.

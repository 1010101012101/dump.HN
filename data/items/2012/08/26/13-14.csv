Their own research area is, or maybe always was, boring, or has been obviated by technological developments or scientific advances.  So they move into politics, perhaps carrying a sense that there is something wrong with the field that can only be corrected by radical surgery.  They then demand that researchers do what they themselves never did in their own careers, kicking the ladder out from behind them.</i><p>Harper goes on to say that the above is a ""somewhat contentious premise."" I agree it's acrimonious; I'm not sure I agree with the acrimony.",1345989577

4435083,comment,4434843,4435021,8,0,calinet6,,,"Despite being someone with a formal CS background, I completely understand where you're coming from. I've worked on practical applications for the last 5 years with very little consideration for the details of algorithms or the underlying theories behind what I'm doing.<p>Despite my highly developed pragmatism, I <i>still</i> think understanding those theories at great depth makes me a better programmer.<p>It's almost subconscious, but knowing how the compiler works, how the processor runs the compiled code, and how everything works at the most basic level gives me a more complete idea of what I'm doing under the hood.<p>I guess you could say that it's like having a physics degree would make you a better car mechanic, when the reality is probably far from it. But then, I know lots of car mechanics who would benefit from knowing a little more about the theory of their work rather than just practical know-how. It's a fine balance.<p>Just to respond to your last point: I've been one of those people insisting on doing something the ""right"" way. I disagree that this is a bad thing, or a sign of inexperience or lack of understanding. Often when I have to argue hard for taking this ""right"" path, it's because of experience with doing it the <i>other</i> way, and a belief that one would only do it the ""wrong"" way because of inexperience. So in other words, I have exactly the opposite view on that entire subject.<p>Often the ""right"" way to do things takes a little more time, a little more work, but is usually more rock solid in the long term or easy to understand for other programmers. It's more deterministic and predictable, and usually more about good architecture than raw performance (or it should be).<p>In general you have good practical points that every programmer should be aware of. By no means should real programming be done in an academic and theoretical manner. But at the same time, theoretical CS is provably correct about a vast number of concepts (that is it's business after all), and by no means should they be ignored or looked down upon. The truth lies in a balance between practicality and theory here, and one should never take a side. Look at each situation with the perspective it demands and solve it using the wide variety of tools available to you, and be prepared to accept that a solution might be more theoretical or more practical than you're willing or able to understand.",1345989279

4435035,comment,4434844,4434844,1,0,tokenadult,,,"It would certainly be naive in the extreme to suppose that the whole national economy would improve if every person of working age spent the time, effort, and money to add one degree to his or her resume. At the individual level of analysis, in some occupations, a typical degree for that occupation seems to be all upside for the degree-holder. A commonly made statement in books about industrial psychology is that an engineer has higher earnings over the course of a lifetime, adjusted for the cost of obtaining a degree, at ALL levels of IQ. In other words, if you like technical occupations, do whatever it takes to be classified as an engineer rather than as a technician, and in many workplaces that means get a college degree.<p>But at the societal level of analysis, it is much less clear that increasing the societal percentage of college graduates is really beneficial. The example of different national development strategies during the 1960s and 1970s helps clarify what might be involved. Some newly independent former colonies, especially in Africa, pursued strategies of promoting higher education with publicly subsidized college for elite students, so that the most capable learners would no longer have to study abroad to gain degrees. Other countries with a similar degree of wealth (the year my wife was born, Taiwan was poorer than Zambia) pursued a strategy of broad access to well delivered primary, and then secondary, education, with higher education paid for in larger part by family resources of families willing to pursue higher education. The broad-based national education policy of making the masses better educated promoted much more economic growth (and political democratization and liberalization) than the focus-on-elites policy of directly increasing the number of college graduates.<p>There is formal research on how much students learn during college attendance,<p><a href=""http://www.todroberts.com/USF/PerfectStorm_UndergradEducation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.todroberts.com/USF/PerfectStorm_UndergradEducatio...</a><p><a href=""http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/01/18/study_finds_large_numbers_of_college_students_don_t_learn_much"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/01/18/study_finds_la...</a><p>and the unsurprising finding of that research is that some students learn quite a bit during their college years, but some hardly learn anything at all. College-as-such, without regard to what major the student pursues, and what the academic atmosphere of the college is, doesn't necessarily lead to intellectual growth for the enrolled students.<p>P.S. Noting an early downvote to this comment, I'm wondering what people who disagree with these observations of the real world have to say to provide evidence for their disagreement. I learned during my high school education, and continued to learn during my college education, to ask for citations of facts as I form my opinions about public policy.",1345987592

Having a CS degree doesn't make you immune to any of your assertions. What you're describing is just a <i>bad programmer</i>.<p>I believe the GP's argument is about programmers with CS degrees who don't 'get' simplicity, because they can't validate their own intelligence and qualifications with it.

Apple makes (in my opinion) great hardware: I haven't found a better iPad-like or Air-like or even Macbook-like. I like the Lenovo t420 but I like my Macbook more; I really don't care at all about looks or brand; it's just nice to work with IMHO.<p>This kind of 'practice' has been going on for a looooong time. All 'younger' people should read about MS in the 80s & 90s. You didn't see it and maybe you think they are great now and Windows 7/8 is so much better than mac/lin etc; read up on the history. They used to be hardcore evil. If HN was around in those times, there would be stories of disgust and misery on the frontpage every single day. It's nothing new.<p>Companies defend their backyard in any way possible and they just add power-points to their company by taking this kind of action. If they didn't take this action or they would've lost, maybe Samsung could just 1 to 1 copy their products and get away with that. Would that be good for consumers? I don't think so. I am against patents and i'm actually against all patents; I don't believe they are for the greater good of humanity. If you cannot get your 'invested research money/time' (which is bullshit for most patents) back by execution, maybe you should just sell the entire research to a company that can and not try to peddle it yourself.<p>But as long as this kind of shit exists, don't worry about it. It doesn't affect you nor 'the consumer', Samsung has to say that as 1000s and 1000s of companies did before them who lost. In reality Samsung just pays something per infringing product sold to Apple and that's it. Hopefully cases like this will have companies fighting harder against patents and make pacts to open up patents for the real greater good. Not sure if I'll see that in my lifetime though :)",1345987067

4435021,comment,4434843,4434880,28,0,mgkimsal,,,"I fall in to that camp.  I don't look down on 'theoretical CS' stuff, but it's <i>rarely</i> ever even had to be a consideration in projects I've worked on, which has included ecommerce systems selling billions of dollars of stuff (large qtys, small price per item), real time reporting of financial data, and numerous other projects requiring a degree of scale or speed or both (php, vb, java and other stuff over the years).<p>Not everyone works on facebook, nor is everyone writing real-time device drivers, nor is everyone writing something that will explode up in users tomorrow, devastating the business if not every customer is served in less than 50ms.<p>I may be one of those in the 'get it done' camp, but I've also learned over the past several years to opt for using well-known libraries when possible, to take advantage of the expertise and skills that I don't have (yet).  15 years ago, I was firmly in the 'write it from scratch and focus on performance, tightness, elegance, etc' camp, but not so much today.  Part of that is because we simply didn't have the wealth of free software libraries we do today, so you <i>had</i> to write more stuff from scratch, but that's not as much of an excuse today.<p>I've yet to have to write a binary search after 17 years in professional software development, and my projects have not suffered because of it.  I had probably a good 10 years of hobbyist time before that, so I probably have simply picked up 'good' patterns to common problems without necessarily knowing the specific CS theory or names behind them in some cases.<p>All that said, my answer to performance issues in my apps is generally not 'throw more hardware at it' - I will profile to look for bottlenecks, isolate specific areas and rewrite sections of code to make them more performant, which sometimes means changing how data is organized/stored, or modifying queries, or something else.<p>Lastly, while I think I understand the type of person/attitude you're talking about ""full of self-important people like this"", I don't think I see myself in that particular camp (but of course, no one ever does, right?).  There's a degree of pragmatism that needs to happen in 'real world' software dev (isn't agile all about ""you ain't gonna need it""?).  I've also had to 'clean up' after enough other developers over the past 17 years - <i>including myself on a number of occasions</i> - that my perspective may be sufficiently different from the type of people that work in company X for 10 years and rise to the rank of 'sr dev' only ever having worked in one or two places.  Or maybe I'm just a self-important ass who's justifying himself too much in public?<p>EDIT: One other thing that has popped in to my head - I've worked on more than couple projects where other people on the team (before me or concurrently) insisted on certain things being done ""right"", simply because that was the ""right"" way.  Two things were apparent - they typically didn't know any other way at all (lack of experience) and they had no understanding of what the real use of the application was - never talked to end users or other depts/units, and were creating far more work for everyone else by not implementing things differently (in their minds, 'compromising on correctness').

If they were images of events with political aspects, war images, images or persons etc they would not be published manipulated, but in this case we are talking about essential manipulation (stitching, colour correction, move to the visible spectrum, etc), and not creative image doctoring like pasting some space or removing a person USSR style.<p>(1) And presumably as readers.

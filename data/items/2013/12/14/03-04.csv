But is anyone welcome to try to ruin someone&#x27;s reputation just because you happen to disagree on something as ephemeral as a one-off joke? Do we really want to be THAT sensitive that even kidding about something is entirely verboten or you&#x27;ll ruin your reputation forever?<p>You&#x27;ve seriously never said something in the moment that you thought was funny at the time that you wish you could have a take back on?",1386993565

It&#x27;s probably because I play games casually and try not to spend too much time, and after playing them on OnLive, it&#x27;s really hard to go back to the non-streaming model. It&#x27;s like...

Particularly when you consider that carrier and OEM marketing (large national campaigns, in-store placement, etc) doesn&#x27;t scale down to small volume products.<p>Making niche products doesn&#x27;t work well for consumer electronics in general, unless you can sell that product at a much higher margin. Having a keyboard on a phone just doesn&#x27;t seem to result in being able to sell it for twice as much.<p>Another issue with keyboards is they don&#x27;t internationalize well. So rather than having 1 hardware design worldwide, you now either need a TON of SKUs - one for each country (and you can&#x27;t move inventory from one market to another) or you need to further limit your target market to just a few regions.",1386993493

Not that it&#x27;s my area of expertise, but I guess it kind of is now. Let me tell you, this is one of the better recruiting emails I&#x27;ve seen. Highlights:<p>- Technical leadership reaching out. Not a recruiter. HUGE. Do this.<p>- Personal! Actual knowledge of who you are as a developer. Not just a quick scan of github and then a project name drop. (Literally had this happen to me yesterday. Ick. And soooo obvious.)<p>- Early appeal to &quot;what&#x27;s in it for me?&quot; and &quot;who will I work with?&quot; BEFORE the &quot;who are we?&quot; bit.<p>- Dogfooding in the email. Nice touch.<p>Downers:<p>- The popped-collar, Natty Ice tone. Kind of a filters out the non-bros. But I guess it tells you about the company culture...?<p>- I don&#x27;t know if this job is remote or local, but if it&#x27;s local, show me pictures of where I&#x27;ll work.<p>I understand why Kyle wasn&#x27;t receptive (and love the creative response), but this is probably enough to move a lot of people on to that next step of the face to face meeting.

6904401,comment,6895502,6898533,1,0,softbuilder,,,"Hmm. I feel misunderstood. Let me try to cut across what we&#x27;re both talking about and see if we end up at the same place:<p>Brick walls have a very high level of observability. A non-bricklayer can look at a wall and tell if it fills the space it is supposed to fill, if the wall is obviously crooked or warped, if bricks are missing, and if mortar is missing between bricks. They can do all of this with very little expertise because they can physically inspect the wall and they have also seen many walls before and have internalized some norms for walls.<p>Compare this with a non-programmer&#x27;s experience with software. All they see is the user interface, which is usually a very small part of the whole. Software has a very low level of observability.<p>Brick walls - typically - are also very simple systems when compared to software such as what is described in the original article. Lower complexity combined with a high level of visibility and broadly shared expectations means that lay people can make many more accurate judgements about a wall, the progress of a wall, the quality of work being done on a wall, etc. without being experts on wall building or brick laying.<p>This is not to take away from expert tradespeople or diminish their value. It&#x27;s just a completely different situation which I believe was the intent of the original analogy.",1386990495

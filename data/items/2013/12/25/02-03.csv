It is unprofessional to me in the sense that you don&#x27;t honor your customers&#x27; preference. Imagine Apple releases iTune with that feature, and decided that a bunch of artists are not played by default because it was fun to do that by being themselves, how would the public react? If this were just an app made with a friend, fine, maybe it was never unprofessional to the company behind it, but definitely not professional to the consumers, from the consumer&#x27;s point of view. It wasn&#x27;t a video app that restricts 18+ videos off by default.<p>And also a bit harsh to pick a particular band. I can be happier if this were just an April Fool joke and the team had made a prior agreement with the band that this was only for April Fool.<p>If you actually think Nickelback fans&#x27; complains are somewhat important for you to write a blog post, then you are definitely thinking about why it shouldn&#x27;t be done in the first place.",1387939758

As lazy is as is possible.  Yet their laziness lacks the power to offend.  No sane person is going to become <i>offended</i> by somebody dredging up some lame 10 year old joke about cats that like to eat cheeseburgers.   Wherever you find an example of a <i>&quot;joke that is so lazy, it is offensively lazy&quot;</i>, there is without fail a more plausible explanation for the offense the joke elicits.<p>For example, <i>&quot;Australians are upside-down&quot;</i>.  Lazy, and makes many people upset.  Are they upset because it is lazy?  No, they are upset because it is picking on other people (themselves or others).",1387938657

Oh we might quibble about the restrictions it places on us as programmers, but it works from an end user perspective pretty much &#x27;okay.&#x27;<p>However, a lot of communication is <i>not</i> insecure iterated text communication. \nEmail&#x27;s not so much broken as it is incomplete and largely inextensible.<p>From that perspective, even something as simple as having a chat with someone through email seems very odd. I mean why are our replies to each other different messages? Why aren&#x27;t they just inserted seamlessly into one thread in the same way that IRC works?<p>Setting up a meeting? Oh I know that there are email setups that can do that in corp-space, and theoretically a civ-space client could use them too. But that&#x27;s not the way things tend to go. In many ways the use of social media to setup meetings is the direct result of emails lack of extensibility in this regard.<p>Keeping group photo albums? Should be easily doable without the need for a central server like facebook.<p><i>Secure</i> chat? Oh, where will we get a trusted certificate authority from? Well, if you don&#x27;t want to meet the person you&#x27;ve got that problem whatever you&#x27;d doing. If you can see the other person, however, you just generate a short random string on your computer, encode it with their public key and see whether they can decode it at their end. No point exchanging the whole key, just check the thing works.<p>Varying access levels by trust?<p>Keeping a persistent contacts list across multiple devices?<p>Presence-aware communication? (Actually knowing someone&#x27;s at the other end and available right then.)<p>So people, to varying extents, use other tools for these things. The major cheerleader for email&#x27;s borked at the moment seems to be the security aspect, with implications for trusted senders.<p>I mean heck, that&#x27;s something that would kill most spam right away there - if you had senders that were verifiable as the same person every time, you could implement something like: &#x27;X wants to send to add you to their contact book, do you know them?&#x27; Public-facing email addresses would still get spam but we could just blacklist everyone you said you didn&#x27;t know for your private address and not bother decoding the messages at all - straight to the bin with them.",1387938466

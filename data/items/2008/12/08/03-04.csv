You could use your current templates.<p>I'm really trying hard to figure out what kind of non-technical reason would dictate a ton of work for no technical value.  DHH insult your boss?  It just seems weird to make a technical decision for non-technical reasons.<p>Django can probably handle it, but you'd have to override things for every table.  You wouldn't be able to reuse your templates and, well, it's different enough that you'll be finding gotchas everywhere.  Rails has gotchas too, but you've already dealt with the Rails ones.  It just seems like a lot of work for a non-technical reason.",1228708748

It's expensive to find and hire good people and it's also human nature, at least mine, to try to help people improve before giving up on them. Also, when profits are high it's easy to let things slide.

So the author only has to accept a couple patches from his Mac-using colleagues, and then he's basically set for OS X.

Everything else allows me to template nicely except arrays.<p>Python: The error message passed when you call a method with the wrong number of arguments.  It's just off since the method ""def apple(self, steve, new_product)"" has three args, but you'll call it with two ""apple(steve, new_product)"".  So, the message that gets passed back if I pass in one or three arguments is just wrong.

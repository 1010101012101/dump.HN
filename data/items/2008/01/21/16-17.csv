Maybe I am spoiled by Java, but for some things I really can't imagine how to properly code them without objects. As an example for something ugly, look at the hashtables in MzScheme.",1200934724
101631,comment,101571,101607,0,0,raju,,,"I looked into 'The Rails Way' over the weekend. As vdm correctly says, its definitely a very comprehensive reference. And it makes as a good book, but you definitely need to work with a basic tutorial to get you up and running quickly. I would recommend ""Agile Web Development with Rails"" but with Rails 2.0 although its a little behind the curve, its not a bad book.<p>I am currently reading ""Practical Social Networking Sites with Rails"", and although its a decent book, the author tends to skip some of the most important details, leaving you wondering how something came about. I would not recommend it.<p>I have read 'Ruby for Rails', and its definitely a good book. David Black is a very good author and teaches you Ruby and shows you how a lot of the 'black-magic' in Rails happens.<p>Here is someone else's review of some of the books - \n<a href=""http://antoniocangiano.com/rails-books/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://antoniocangiano.com/rails-books/</a><p>For Ruby, I would recommend Peter Cooper's book over Programming Ruby any day... especially if you are new to Ruby and/or OOP in general.",1200934683

101621,comment,101559,101609,0,0,binarykeats,,,"The joke is that he implies the languages' FP orentation causes them to have clunky ways to define classes.  Ruby is a good counter to that argument.  It has one of the cleanest class-defining syntaxes out there.  And you can actually write your own functions that behave like ""attr_accessor"", making your class definitions even more readable.<p>Guess how you do it?

101617,comment,101506,101612,0,0,Tichy,,,"I think it has some relevance, because it shows that being in IT does not imply unattractiveness. Talk about unattractiveness of male geeks is quite common, too.<p>Also, I think it would be nonsense to deny our human attributes. Men are interested in women's looks, and vice versa. Actually, isn't it another complaint of successful women that to be successful, they had to become like men (a ka Margaret Thatcher)? So if a successful women is still attractive, it might be a good role model after all.",1200933723
101616,comment,101559,101559,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Wow. So, from what I can tell, his argument that functional languages have no future, is that they're not imperative, inherently object-oriented languages, and that they're not strictly typed. Well, that may be so. So really what's going on here is that he's not willing to learn and understand how functional languages really work. (and how they are put to best use)<p>""The jury is still out, but I wouldn't bet on scalability. As a project manager during the 90s two of my projects didn't scale and had to be rewritten, one in Python and one in Perl.

Though it's hard to gauge, if the expected outcome is better than what you'd get for starting a new startup or working a desk job, then you should keep going at it.<p>1000 users is pretty good, in my opinion.

101611,comment,100658,101184,0,0,rkts,,,"Hmm... well, BSD init is easier to use than SysV init.  The ports system is also known for its simplicity.  The source code is contained in a single CVS tree and the entire OS can be built with a few commands.  The man pages and handbook are consistent and well written.<p>Much of the difference is subjective.  FreeBSD feels coherently designed, whereas Linux is a patchwork of programs written by different people with different styles and philosophies.<p>I don't know a lot about Gentoo (most of my experience is with Debian and Slackware) but from what I understand, its purpose is to be as flexible as possible.

There may be stigma against women in chat rooms like this one, and women may have a stigma against becoming hackers.  These are just hypotheses, of course, and by no means do they apply to all hackers or all women.  They're just general trends I've heard cited.  That being said, the ratio of girl haxxors to guy haxxors in my dorm seems to be getting better.  It's like 1:4 where it used to be 1:7.\nAnother problem is that hacking is not very glamorous.",1200932998

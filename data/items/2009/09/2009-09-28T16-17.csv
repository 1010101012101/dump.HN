- let people rate courses
- have groupings of courses (the newbie section, the system/compiler/database section, the OOP section, the algorithm section, etc)
- tag courses with their programming languages/topics/levels, etc
- search by keyword (could be offset by having tags)<p>I like the logo and really like that you have free ebook links on some of the courses.",1254157116

Copying, for copyright purposes, is copying bytes (ignoring the whole look and feel thing).  It's reasonably easy to use software mechanism X to accomplish purpose Y without copying bytes.<p>You seem to think that purpose should be limited to ""H.264"".  If, for the purposes of argument, the relevant mechanism actually is useful for many other kinds of video encoding, it's unclear why that limitation makes sense.  If the mechamism is worthy of protection for one protocol, why should it be unprotected when used in another?<p>Note that protocol ownership is different from mechanism ownership.

That's because they have to.<p>The alternative is to simply accept the fallacy that people from elite backgrounds are simply better than you.<p>> There is also a tendency, in some of these people making a lot of noise, to do it in the form of diminishing others.
So likewise, what many non-elite persons perceive is that, through various overt and subtle messages, that elites broadcast that they are better than non-elites. Perhaps through acts like social exclusion or hiring discrimination. I don't think that instances of a person saying ""~~~I~~~ went to Harvard, and ~~~you~~~~ didn't so nyah"" are all that common (but they do happen).<p>I think the author gets this and <i>does</i> in fact rail against this practice as a form of bullying.",1254155943

I'm not saying a scheduling system for your local dentists office needs to be a six-figure job; I'm saying, pull the right levers to get the number where it needs to be. Specifically:<p>* You can make 24/7 support a line-item premium service.<p>* You can make support after a 2-week ""acceptance"" period a line-item premium service.<p>* You can have your basic rate include a 6-week window for delivery, at your shop's discretion, and make a more predictable delivery date a line-item premium service.<p>* You can have formal typeset documentation be a line-item premium service.<p>* You can have access to improvements and feature requests incur a full consulting dev cycle on your basic rate, and offer a line-item premium service to do point- and major- release updates for N years.<p>* You can staff projects with timelines that allow you to juggle 3-4 projects for different clients simultaneously (even if you do them serially, you preserve the scheduling flex to deliver them all at once), and offer a line-item premium to get a 100% or 200% improvement in time frame.<p>* In bare-knuckle negotiation with a client who is just being a good businessperson and determined to get the lowest rate possible, you can strip off features from their requirements, down to the minimum they could conceivably accept and still call the project a business win, and negotiate over features instead of rate.<p>If you do <i>all</i> of these things, you're rustproofing. But if you're not prepared to do any of them, your only lever is going to be your consulting rate, and the dynamics of the freelancing market are going to tend to drive your rate down over the medium term.",1254154787

Rate hike discussions are zero-sum negotiations in which either you continue working at your original rate or the purchaser takes a job performance hit. It may be easier to acquire new customers at a higher rate than it will be to jack the rate up on an existing customer. And eventually, you're going to run across clients you <i>really</i> want, under competitive RFP situations, where they'll demand ""most favored"" rates --- so that 60% ""entry"" rate is now your permanent negotiating floor, no matter where your industry goes.<p>Discount with project scope, or with deliverable depth, or with long-term support, or with scheduling flexibility. Some of these non-financial perks are more valuable to your clients than the monopoly money they're spending out of IT budget --- all the more reason not to send an ""amateur"" signal with a below-market rate.

I have never met anyone (myself included) that performs anywhere near their potential.  This applies to everyone, not just programmers.

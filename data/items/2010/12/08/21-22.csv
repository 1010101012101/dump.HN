The initial thing most people try is some sort of dictionary approach, but after a while you end up realizing that a critical part of a project team's work is to create working definitions of common concepts. This is called the problem domain language (insert long talk which includes Ludwig Wittgenstein here) Words mean something because of the semantic web they are presented in. They have no meaning on their own.<p>So ""Customer"" or ""Account"", while sounding like clear terms, are actually the same problem as ""terrorism"" Unless you come up with (and own) a definition, analysis will be impossible because of contradictions.<p>Sorry. Slipped into teacher mode.<p>This is just stuff I do all the time, so I don't have a problem with creating working definitions, no matter what the topic is. I'd much rather be considered an oddball with my own definitions than circling my tail trying to pin down what things like ""war"" or ""terrorism"" is.

Anyone running these firewalls is exposing their users to a severe security problem whether WebSocket is included in browsers or not.<p>I’m not sure if there’s any kind of “TCP appliance test suite” that could be used to catch horribly broken and insecure proxies and firewalls, but in addition to changing the WebSocket spec, someone should really set up some Flash-based tests that exploit this and tell those users/network admins whose firewalls who are vulnerable that they should do something about it.",1291845125

The conclusion seems to be that there are lots of alternatives to pirating, and most, if not all, of the posters agree that it is at least unethical to use pirated software.<p>However, there is an idea that still makes me feel uncomfortable. Competitive advantage was mentioned as a factor in the choice, but do you really think that the rest of the world shares your mindset with you?<p>As an example, take the eLance, vWorker, etc coders for hire . Giving the amount of labor that is being sourced there. Piracy is rampant on developing countries, and you're really competing not only in quality or hourly rates, but also on the amount of investment required to have the necessary tools.<p>Ironically, all this work is outsourced from companies that likely respect licensing conditions religiously.<p>The problem has no easy solution. Either pirate in the same level as them or make them pay as you do. The second solution seems to me unrealistic in a short to medium time frame.<p>This is not an argument in favour of piracy, just an observation on how piracy unbalances the competition.<p>Personally, I always use free tools. If there is no free tool available for the job, either I pay for it or don't accept the work.<p>In the past, I accepted a junior student installing an unlicensed copy at home just to learn as something that was not hurting anyone, and even likely to benefit MS/Adobe/Autodesk in the long term.

1984741,comment,1983141,1984056,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"You must have very cheap rent.<p>If you don't ask for money for what you do, then you are saying that what you do is worthless. You probably don't actually believe that, and the only reason to sell your work for less than the most basic labor is because you don't know how to get paid properly. But customers see your pricing and conclude that designers do not need to be paid even the normal minimum for other kinds of work.<p>If you keep working like this, you will find yourself unable to ever get a design job that pays well. Everyone who calls you will do so because you are cheap. When you go to visit clients who have money to spend, they will not want to hire you. Not because their is anything wrong with your design; but because they are not designers, and so they will try to estimate the quality of your work by the visibility of your financial success. If they notice nothing that suggests you can make money, then they will assume that you can't, and they will assume that the reason you can't is because your designs are no good, and hire someone else. \nLater, when you want to get married or have a family or just enjoy a better standard of living, but you can not afford to do so because you undervalued your work, you will realize that you designed yourself into poverty. It's true that some very rich/successful people dress or act like they don't care about money. This is because they have so much money that they don't have to care about what clients think. They have agents who take care of all that annoying business stuff for them. Agents only work for people whose work can be sold for high prices, because agents only get 15%, on average.<p>A lot of creative people fall into this trap, I have made this mistake on some occasions. It is a bad pattern, for you and also for your colleagues in the same profession. Also, it's insulting to people who work in offices or flip burgers. Maybe they would like to work at something creative, but when you price your work so low you are demonstrating that creativity is worthless, and that skill and hard work do not deserve a reward. Here's my advice: it's OK to do some work for free for your friends and family, but when you work for money your minimum should be 5 x the minimum for a 'boring' job. Some people will refuse to pay so much, and then you must refuse to work even if your bank account and your stomach are empty. Many will agree. You should use your price to drive bad clients away. Good clients will either pay or negotiate. If you do not make them work in negotiation, they will understand this to mean that you are not going to work on their commission, and hire someone else.<p>If you cannot make a living this way, then get a job flipping burgers. First you will learn some humility, second you will get free food every day, third you will have some more financial security and fourth you will be very tired when you go home every day. Now, do a few hours of design work every week too. Of course, it will be much more difficult now because you are exhausted by working in a hot kitchen before you draw a single line.

A larger pool means a higher likelihood of these groups including people with the knowledge and ability to do ever-increasing damage.<p>The long-term implications are interesting. Into the future, are we talking about the instant formation and dissolution of ""terrorist"" or ""dissident"" groups, bound together by transient common interest and gone again within days or hours?\nIf you're a government or corporation, this is terrifying.

The exact questions to ask depend largely on the role for which you are interviewing, as well as the interviewee's background. The best questions tend to be open-ended, behavioral, and relevant.<p>Open-ended meaning they shouldn't end with a Yes or No answer. They should lead to a longer discussion that allows you to ask follow-on questions, probe deeper into their thinking, and arrive to the core influencers of their past decisions.<p>Behavioral questions assume that past performance is the best predictor of future performance. Therefore, ask them about previous situations and how they specifically dealt with them. There's less chance a candidate will answer with a generic & good-sounding answer this way.<p>Relevance goes back to bartonfink's questions. Asking a programmer about his favorite accounting methods is as good as asking a chef whether he prefers Ruby or Python.<p>But in case you're just looking for general, all-purpose questions, here are three of my favorites:<p>* How do you personally define and measure success?<p>* What are you doing to improve yourself, physically, mentally, or spiritually?<p>* In what kind of work environment do you do your best work?<p>In case it helps, I have seven more in a blog post (don't mean to be spammy or SEO slimy; nofollows takes care of that):<p><a href=""http://bizthoughts.mikelee.org/ten-great-interview-questions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bizthoughts.mikelee.org/ten-great-interview-questions...</a>",1291842718

But this construct doesn't hold up for linking, so I just have to remember it arbitrarily by remembering cp. function(src, dest) just generally seems to be the unofficial ""right way"" of ordering things.",1291842090

It kinda-seems like every tech startup these days is drinking the angel/VC koolaid. The financing option I never hear about in technology and on YC, is a traditional bank small business loan.<p>On first inspection is seems like a great option; I don't have to give away any ownership of my company. Once approved, the bank gives me money, and basically says do whatever you want with it, just pay us back.<p>The downside is of course the interest, but assuming I can become profitable in the short term, interest is negligible.<p>Wanted to get insight from the YC community though on thoughts about small business loans.",1291842040

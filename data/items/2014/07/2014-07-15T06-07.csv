This involves learning the importance of small changesets, coding conventions and readable/understandable code, among other things.<p>Also, coding in the industry involves a lot of learning to use tools and techniques that others have developed and far less developing those things on your own. A ton of the code that gets written in the industry is glue code between well-known solutions or boilerplate for a well-known framework.<p>None of this is to say that a PhD can&#x27;t learn those things or even hasn&#x27;t learned those things by the time they interview, but I can confirm from our interview process that there are a lot of them that haven&#x27;t and I&#x27;d rather hire a fresh CS grad who will be cheaper and likely be more humble rather than struggling to convince a PhD that those things are important.",1405407084

8035090,comment,8034382,8034794,2,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>how far should censorship go?</i><p>That&#x27;s easy. There should be no government mandated censorship.<p>First of all - because it doesn&#x27;t work for the intended purpose. The Internet is so dynamic that no method of censorship can stop information from being disseminated. Your own children are all &quot;safe&quot; and protected, until a friend teaches them how to get passed that filter to view porn or whatever and your children will want to view porn, especially given a lack of education from parents. It&#x27;s also a pretty dumb filter and governments are failing even at censoring PirateBay or WikiLeaks. Without proper supervision and education, it will just happen. Censoring extreme political views, or any political views that go against the system doesn&#x27;t work either. It never did. Actually censorship helps in disseminating extreme political views and the only thing that helps is proper education.<p>Second of all, there are no lines to be drawn - what represents useful information for some people, may hurt the feelings of other people. Nobody is in a position to decide what information should be censored. And if I want to jerk off on people having sex with horses, why should anybody have a problem with that. Being tolerant of people that are different from us in one way or another is a lesson that the German people should have learned, otherwise we are bound to repeat the same mistakes over and over again.",1405406030

On the opposite end, a software bug ultimately has one (or multiple) very much identifiable root causes.<p>All that to say that, it might not be possible to understand the causes of IBS/anxiety/stress, and thus, treating the symptoms might actually be the cure.

After all, time is the finite resource that we can only divide between our sockpuppet identities, but we can&#x27;t poof more of it into our aggregate identities. That&#x27;s assuming that this &quot;certain sort of interaction&quot; is something that can&#x27;t easily be scaled out of sync with our time (as could perhaps be done with our digital interactions on Twitter).<p>My first crazy thought was some sort of average proximity from other human beings, where perhaps our phones could sign a digital transaction when we pass within a certain proximity and stay there some amount of time /t/, for some value weighted by proximity and time. The time-proximity (to make up a word, because why not?) from fellow humans might vary by geography, but I assume it might have some degree of consistency on the order of magnitude. So someone in Toronto, Canada would have a value comparable to fellow citizens, but would obviously not be on the same magnitude as someone in a rural Russian village. So if I&#x27;m in a certain geographic place and my time-proximity for interacting with my fellow humans is consistent, and aligns with margins of error for that place, then maybe some undescribed service or oracle monitoring the identity network are happy. but if that drops drastically, then maybe that&#x27;s because i&#x27;ve created a new identity and started to sign interactions with that. Or maybe it&#x27;s something more innocent, like a job switch. Or a depression. Maybe that&#x27;s what the oracle needs to confirm.<p>But anyhow, simple time-proximity wouldn&#x27;t work, as the real humans are using phones that aren&#x27;t visually confirming the interaction with another real human. So maybe it would need to be something like Google Glass that recognizes and signs transactions using eye contact as the trigger -- detecting eye contact as a symmetrical relationship, reading/sharing identities, signing and broadcasting a record of that human interaction. Someone could fake data, but it would likely interact with the &quot;real&quot; world network&#x27;s data in a detectably odd way.<p>I guess what this is all about is a distributed, self-referential version of TrustCloud.com. But none of this seems to solve the &quot;this is a human: y/n&quot; sort of question -- but more like a &quot;this human is likely 80% of a human identity in geography X&quot; or something like that. So maybe they now deserve a certain take of a pie (if socialcoin were a thing).<p>Anyhow, I&#x27;m sure this is incredibly flawed on many levels, but it was a fun thought experiment to work through :) Feel free to point out any glaring errors in logic, or to promptly ignore it, for that matter",1405404867

8035033,comment,8028793,8028793,1,0,HardwareLover,,,"The difficulty of making connected hardware products and the failure of crowdfunded hardware projects/products are not new. The controversy surrounding crowdfunded hardware tend to come and go, and different allegations--from fraud to failure of products--take center stage each time.<p>Generally, these allegations come about because of the shipping/delivery delays, and there are a whole bunch of factors that contribute to the delays, such as unrealistic expectations on the part of the inventor -- what the startup hopes to deliver in a product (eg. 10 high specification features packed into a keychain sized device) versus what current technologies and materials can actually do (eg. 5 high spec features in a palm-sized device).<p>Another factor is the sophistication of a product. In general (from conversations with project managers who worked at Asian OEMs/ODMs), the typical time taken to develop and build a product (of similar quality to iProducts) takes at least 12-18 months. Unless your product can be whiteboxed (or a similar product has been done before), this is the typical minimum time-frame required to build consumer electronics. And if your product falls under a new category (eg. key-sized food scanners), then more time will be required to research, develop and find the right technologies/materials to build the product. The product is not impossible to build, but just requires more time to make it happen.<p>Of course, the inventor can turn to any factory in Shenzhen to manufacture the product (which may agree to a shorter manufacturing time-frame in order to get your business), but what you get eventually is a product that doesn&#x27;t work well after investing a large sum of money (<a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/07/how-one-kickstarter-project-squandered-3-5-million/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/07/how-one-kickstarter-p...</a>).<p>The reason why hardware takes a long time to make and bring to market is because, unlike software, after the molding is done, the product needs to undergo many iterations, testing, certifications, blah blah blah... Also, before a product is shipped, at least over 30 key decisions typically need to be made and over 400 tasks need to be completed in sequence at different stages--and missing a task may result in weeks-long delay.<p>For software developers looking to make hardware and have no previous hardware-making experience, suggest you involve someone familiar with the manufacturing process and pitfalls right from the start (eg. product concept stage). The person could be an in-house or external expert, and by involving the person early, you can ensure that your design/specs/expectations are feasible --> in turn giving a realistic manufacturing time-frame.<p>If you need to get an estimation of the time needed for your hardware product development, check out this SaaS navigation tool: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jlim/2014/07/08/the-new-hwtrek-guides-hardware-projects-from-idea-to-production-in-asia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/jlim/2014/07/08/the-new-hwtrek-g...</a>.",1405404504

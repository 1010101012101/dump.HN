If so, then the inverse follows: by allowing prostitution, there is less of that sort of suffering.<p>Prohibiting gambling: same thing - gambling happens regardless of whether it&#x27;s legal or not. If it&#x27;s legal, the government can at least tax it significantly.<p>Prohibiting drugs: I don&#x27;t think that the government is smarter than me; cars are dangerous, and scalpels are dangerous, but we don&#x27;t prohibit them, we simply require people to educate themselves first before they can use them. I think the same could be done with drugs; in fact, it would be better than the current situation where noone really knows what effect drugs have.<p>> you were just deliberately being obtuse<p>Well, up until this point I thought your comment was very thoughtful, but here it went from good to terrible; you know, people with &quot;normal&quot; intelligence can disagree as well.

Secondly there is the argument that many prostitutes are being forced into their work. Empirical evidence shows in countries around the world that legalizing prostitution does not (completely) take away human trafficking and sex slavery. So, the argument is, if we prohibit prostitution, there will be less of that sort of suffering.<p>- betting: this is based on a protect-people-against-themselves theory. Since betting is addictive to some people, these have been many cases in the past where people were driven to ruin by it. Furthermore, there are many 2nd degree victims - the families and children of gambling addicts, society at large for the damage they do to fund their addiction, etc. So again the reasoning is - let&#x27;s prohibit gambling, then these will go away.<p>- drugs: well this is actually similar to betting; its effect might also compromise somebodies&#x27; health, but the fundamental reason is protecting people against themselves from something of which they cannot quite assess the effects when they start on it, and are unable to detach themselves from when they get into problems.<p>Then again, I think you and anybody else with a &#x27;normal&#x27; intelligence are/is perfectly capable of coming to these conclusions yourself, and you were just deliberately being obtuse; but just to get this pseudo-anarchistic discussion out of the way before it really gets started, I thought I&#x27;d point out the obvious.",1382697230

A metal work workshop is not something the typical urban criminal has access to. Yes, I realize there are many people in rural areas who have such workshops, and shared workshops in urban settings, so theoretically yadda yadda yadda, but the practical (socio-economic) reality is that those who want firearms for criminal purposes in the vast majority of cases do not have access to these tools, and/or lack the knowledge to reverse engineer and adapt available plans for metal weapons, and manufacture them. It&#x27;s quite hard to make a metal gun using a traditional lathe and milling machine, and even when using a high-end CNC.<p>3d printing on the other hand requires no more than the average high school kid&#x27;s computer knowledge, plus a few files downloaded from the internet. The barrier to entry is orders of magnitude lower.<p>The costs are vastly lower, too - you can get started printing a gun (although I don&#x27;t think guns made on MakerBots today will actually work) for ~ 1000$.

You can treat an existing HD as a key-value store where the keys is the location on disk and the value is a sector of binary data. Conceptually there&#x27;s no difference.<p>The answer is: If you need those capabilities to offer up a traditional file system, you do as you do today: you layer it on top.<p>But many systems <i>don&#x27;t</i>, because they already re-implement reliability measures <i>on top</i> of hard drives, as we want systems that are reliably available in the case of server failure too.<p>E.g. consider something like Sheepdog: <a href=""https://github.com/sheepdog/sheepdog"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sheepdog/sheepdog</a>
Sheepdog is a cluster block device solution with automatic rebalancing and snapshots. It implements this on top of normal filesystems by storing &quot;objects&quot; on any of a number of servers, and uses that abstraction to provide all the services. Currently sheepdog requires the sheep daemon to run on a set of servers that can mount a file system on the disks each server is meant to use. With this system, you could possibly dispense with the filesystem, and have the sheep daemons talk directly to a number of disks that are not directly attached.<p>For sheepdog RAID is not really recommended, as sheepdog implements redundancy itself (and you can specify the desired number of copies of each &quot;block device&quot; ), and it also provides snapshots, copy on write, extensive caching and support incremental snapshot based backups of the entire cluster in one go.<p>So in other words, there are applications that can make very good use of this type of arrangement without any support for raid etc. at the disk level. And for applications that can&#x27;t, a key value store can trivially emulate a block device - after all sheepdog emulates a block device on top of object storage on top of block devices...<p>You could also potentially reduce the amount of rebalancing needed in the case of failures, by having sheep daemons take over the disks of servers that die if the disks are still online and reachable.<p>The biggest challenge is going to be networking costs - as I mentioned elsewhere, SSDs are already hampered by 6Gbps in SATA III, and 10GE switches are ludicrously expensive still.",1382696269

6610677,comment,6589067,6605673,1,0,oleganza,,,"The crash would come from malinvestment that is caused by debasement via credit. If the purchasing power was adjusted instantly the moment you print another dollar bill (i.e. prices would grow the same second), then there wouldn&#x27;t be any malinvestment - some people would simply lose or gain wealth.<p>However, owners of new money do not outbid savers on all markets in all products the same day. They go and invest in some particular market changing prices there. E.g. stock market, or housing market, or some foreign production facilities. The money slowly flows to more and more hands finally ending on high street and competing with all existing money there - prices grow, savings diminish, purchasing power of &quot;regular&quot; consumers goes down. But the investment was not accounting for that because it was not known how much and how quickly all this new money will come on the market. Especially if there are numerous capital controls and high friction: the money saturate some other markets for a while until on day X it flows to your market and destroys your business in one month.<p>Example: imagine  you look at current price structure and expect that investment in iPhone factory will let you sell 1 billion iPhones and make some profit. You go and build your factory, pay your bills and finally after 1 year produce 1 billion iPhones. By that time all your investment money is being moved to hands of many private persons who drive up the prices on all goods in the markets they participate in. If they are on your market, bad news for you: food will be more expensive and people will spend less money on your iPhones; and you will go bankrupt (unless you borrow more of printed credit to stay in the game longer). In reality, it&#x27;s more complex. Trillions of dollars are being held outside U.S. and do not cause enormous price increases inside (official stats say &quot;1-2% inflation&quot;) because for foreign holders of dollars there are either no things to buy from U.S., or it&#x27;s hard/expensive to do due to regulations, tariffs etc. So U.S. effectively outsourced destructive effects to other countries where people get poorer faster than in U.S.<p>The bad news: the longer you keep artificial barriers, the harder market will punch you back. The longer U.S. market does not see its own printed dollars, the more and faster these dollars will flood in on some random day when foreign economies will be so depressed, that they&#x27;d try hard to get rid of their greenbacks where they still have high value.<p>Then, of course, U.S. gov would disallow citizens selling stuff to &quot;enemy&quot; countries to prevent too many dollars increasing prices at home. This will effectively move country to a closed loop North Korea-style. No one outside U.S. would want to sell stuff for dollars, and americans won&#x27;t be able to sell their goods to foreigners. Since most of the production is outside the U.S., country would need to build new factories inside. But to do that you need genuine savings. Since all savings are effectively destroyed, huge depression would be on the horizon. So the government would continue printing money, but this time it will go to the home market to build production inside. This will quicker lead to very noticeable inflation and even more bankrupcies and depression. The course of things can be changed by two means: either government intervention will be stopped (e.g. people make a bloody revolution or they switch to Bitcoin), all losses are accepted and people can start saving agin. Or government begins another war and forces other countries to accept dollars and produce stuff for U.S. But that can be done only to the extent on how many productive facilities other countries have and how much can they protect themselves. If the war path continues, it&#x27;ll be just a misery everywhere until USG has nowhere to go and collapse after too much destruction.",1382695734

I went through and read some more of this guy's stuff and he takes a very interesting curve ball attack when it comes to reporting on tech, as opposed to his other journalist colleagues.<p>And he brought up some very good points on why Google might have made a browser.  Maybe they just did it to be doing it, I don't think anyone has come out and been so boldly colloquial in their thinking about the matter.<p>Is it left field?  Yes.
Is it a bit naive?  Just a tad.
Is it relevant?  Completely.<p>This guy underscores everything that needs to happen in tech journalism and he proved that when suggested that Google Chrome was created just because Google wanted to make a browser, and plant their claws deeper into the desktop application scene.<p>Great job.",1220871413

Archie was in a shock, and reason was neither that all the orchids were stolen from Wolfe's gallery or is been out for (more than two) times in a day to solve mystery.
Archie started thinking.
Until in my career, I never saw that fat bastard taking money from a client without
Solving the case and being satisfied that he has really earned the money.
But what the hell is this?
some 'Lisper offers him a couple books (and think what, those are related to LISP which I here are related to black magic, No wonder; Wolfe will enjoy those and will give me hell solving all the mysteries after reading those), 
And he accepts those?
Something is wrong.",1220870103

Let's try it again.<p>42<p>Looks to me like guessing is a pretty easy thing to do. Perhaps you were looking for some kind of formula? As if a piece of math would make you more comfortable about even 5 years from now?<p>I think you're taking the underlying logic to the singularity a little too literally. It's all general trends with general statements to back them up. Wonderful piece of speculation, which I agree with. But it ain't science. It ain't logic. Kurzweil just speculates using a lot of mathematics. I grok it. But I'm not selling my house to buy a bunch of EverReady batteries to power my nanobot Zoot suit any time soon.<p>It's a guess.

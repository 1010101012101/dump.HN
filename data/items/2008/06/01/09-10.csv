The causes of these types of things can generally be found in modern diet and lifestyle factors.<p>The most effective things I've found in improving sleep and general wellbeing are:<p>- giving up caffeine;<p>- reducing anxiety and stress generally particularly before bed.... don't work long hours or work right up till bedtime as you can be running on adrenaline which is terrible for sleep and mental health.<p>- avoid diet drinks and anything containing artificial sweetener (<a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=aspartame"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=aspartame</a>) ... I only recently discovered how terrible this stuff is, and giving it up has done wonders for my wellbeing.<p>- If you snore, have sleep apnoea or any other respiratory condition, look into natural remedies like Buteyko or Pranayama... CPAP machines can help you get better sleep but are counter-productive in the long term as they reinforce your habit of hyperventilation.<p>- Consider seeing an osteopath or similar type of physical therapist to straighten out your skeleton and attend to any muscle tension you have - most people, particularly desk-based workers - have lots of tension which restricts blood flow, contributes to stress and reduces quality of sleep.<p>- Regular exercise is great but be careful if you are already prone to anxiety, as over-exercising can push you into depression (this is counter to what most people understand about exercise & depression)<p>- Consider detoxing and liver cleansing - I've undertaken the lemon detox (""master cleanse"") about every 6 months for the last year or two, and found it's done wonders for muscle tension, quality of sleep, digestion and mental health.<p>Some of these points - in particular the last one - are very contentious and frequently under attack from skeptics, usually who are practitioners of conventional medicine,  vendors of costly commercial solutions like CPAP machines, or professional skeptics like Skepdic, which whilst often  valuable, is often skeptical about things purely because they are unconventional.<p>Whilst I don't have any problems with conventional medicine, it generally focuses treating symptoms of clear-cut diagnosable illnesses, and is not particularly good at addressing the vague lifestyle-related conditions like fatigue, poor sleep, anxiety, muscle tension, digestion etc.<p>These types of conditions can generally be overcome by understanding the fundamentals of the way the body works, and doing everything you can to help your body to work as it was designed.<p>It's not easy, the world of ""natural medicine"" is a dangerous place but my experience is that with persistence, a willingness to experiment, and a healthy level of skepticism, it has much to offer to improve your life greatly.<p>Some helpful links:<p><a href=""http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/5/9/83936/58483"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/5/9/83936/58483</a>\n<a href=""http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/5/16/81428/8007"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/5/16/81428/8007</a>\n(I know you didn't mention any issues with depression, but quality of sleep is closely related to anxiety and depression, and can be a warning sign, and many of the same principles apply in overcoming the problem.)<p><a href=""http://www.buteyko.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.buteyko.com/</a> - if you have breathing/snoring problems.",1212313036

We don't consider this to be a security issue since if you're allowing an attacker to specify a printf format string, you've got much bigger problems already -- this ""issue"" doesn't make things any worse.",1212312577

Lots of things from vitamin deficiencies to cancer can cause fatigue.<p>If you look up the pill on the web you can get information but they tend to list any side effect ever seen.  Check out the list of problems with Tylenol and you'll see the kind of CYA exaggeration I'm talking about.<p>I've never heard of any treatment for restless leg syndrome beside the medicine.",1212312243

205776,comment,205595,205746,0,0,acangiano,,,"You raise a very interesting point. I think that in the Ruby and Rails communities there are plenty of FOSS enthusiasts. Vim, Emacs, RadRails and Netbeans are all very common options. On the operating system side of things, Linux is a very common choice as well, despite the fact that many love Mac OS X.<p>When I made that remark I was mostly thinking about free as in beer vs. commercial. I don't think that companies and developers who adopt Rails as their tool of choice, would have trouble reaching for their wallet, for a product that significantly enhances their development experience. My remark was a way of saying that the Rails community has a track record of being able to pay for quality, be it an operating system, an editor, or hosting, and therefore won't be adverse to a product that has a price tag.<p>That said, I think that the communities have a good relationship with the concept of free as in speech. Many believe in the idea and actively participate in open source projects. Every other Ruby implementation is open source, Rails is open source, and almost all the plugins, gems and libraries out there are free software.<p>Parts of MagLev will be open source too, and this will probably benefit other implementations as well, particularly the conceptually not too distant Rubinius. I think that in the Ruby/Rails community we appreciate FOSS, but we are also pragmatic and accept the fact that some companies may opt for a different business model. The two paradigms can coexist, offering users both FOSS and commercial closed source options.<p>In this specific case, many Rubyists have been ""suffering"" due to MRI's slowness, and if the choice comes down to choosing between having a very slow implementation that is free, and a closed source one that's 30 times faster, most companies will accept the closed source compromise, especially when it comes from a company with a reputation for rock solid and mission critical VMs and architecture. And I don't feel that they can be blamed for it.",1212311430

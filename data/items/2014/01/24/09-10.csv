One point seemed to be made though was: for all of the idiocy and lack of control during the arms race there were no actual nuclear detonations, so were the weapons at the time actually safe (even though many improved safety mechanisms were ignored by the military), or was it just luck due to small-enough sample size and a luckily short enough time span?<p>I actually ordered off of Amazon these two books cited by Schossler and just received them in the last two weeks and am really looking forward to reading them:<p>The Making of the Atomic Bomb - Richard Rhodes:<p>~900 page book that is supposed to be the seminal book about the history of the bomb; also is apparently very detailed in the physics of the endeavor which should be very interesting.<p><a href=""http://amzn.com/1451677618"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amzn.com/1451677618</a><p>American Prometheus - Kai Bird & Martin J.

I <i>hope</i> that I am wrong :)<p>> Yes, it&#x27;s a little awkward, but to understand why this tradeoff was made, think about how you&#x27;d get the nth character in a UTF-8 string. There is a tradeoff between intuitive O(n) string indexing by characters and O(1) string indexing by bytes.<p>I understand the problem of UTF-8 character vs. byte addressing and O(n) vs. O(1) and I have thought about the problem long and hard. And I don&#x27;t claim to have a &quot;correct&quot; solution, this is a tricky tradeoff one way or the other.<p>I think that Julia &quot;does the right thing&quot; but perhaps exposes it to the programmer in a bit funny manner that is prone to runtime errors.<p>> The way out that some programming languages have chosen is to store your strings as UTF-16, and use O(1) indexing by two-byte sequence.<p>Using UTF-16 is a horrible idea in many ways, it doesn&#x27;t solve the variable width encoding problem of UTF-8 but still consumes twice the memory.<p>> The other way out is to store all of your strings as UTF-32/UCS-4. I&#x27;m not sure any programming language does this, because using 4x as much memory for ASCII strings and making string manipulation significantly slower as a result (particularly for medium-sized strings that would have fit in L1 cache as UTF-8 but can&#x27;t as UCS-4) is not really a great design decision.<p>This solves the variable width encoding issue at the cost of 4x memory use. Your concern about performance and cache performance is a valid one.<p>However, I would like to see a comparison of some real world use case how this performs. There will be a performance hit, that is for sure but how big is it in practice?<p>In my opinion, the string type in a language should be targeted at short strings (long strings are some hundreds of characters, typically strings around 32 or so) and have practical operations for that. For long strings (kilobytes to megabytes) of text, another method (some kind of bytestring or &quot;text&quot; type) should be used. For a short string, a 4x memory use doesn&#x27;t sound that bad but your point about caches is still valid.<p>> Instead of O(n) string indexing by characters, Julia has fast string indexing by bytes with chr2ind and nextind functions to get byte indexes by character index, and iterating over strings gives 4-byte characters. Is this the appropriate tradeoff? That depends on your taste.<p>This is <i>obviously</i> the right thing to do when you store strings in UTF-8.<p>My biggest concern is that there will be programs that crash when given non-ascii inputs. The biggest change I would have made is that str[n] should not throw a runtime error as long as n is within bounds.<p>Some options I can think of are: 1) str[n] returns n&#x27;th byte  2) str[n] returns character at n&#x27;th byte or some not-a-character value  3) Get rid of str[n] altogether and replace it with str.bytes()[n] (O(1)) and str.characters()[n] (where characters() returns some kind of lazy sequence if possible, O(n))<p>You&#x27;re right, this boils down to a matter of taste. And my <i>opinion</i> is that crashing at runtime should always be avoided if it is possible by changing the design.<p>> But I don&#x27;t think that additional computer science knowledge would have made this problem any easier.<p>There is a certain difference in &quot;get things done&quot; vs. &quot;do it right&quot; mentality between people who use computers for science and computer scientists. The right way to go is not in either extreme but some kind of delicate balance between the two.",1390556102

I have had two laptops stolen, from my home - once entering by the (closed) door, once by a (closed) window. With them being under FreeBSD and Arch Linux, I&#x27;m quite confident that my data stayed safe (I ihad scans of about all my papers in there). It&#x27;s kind of security through obscurity, but I think it works pretty well, any disk that&#x27;s not FAT32, NTFS or HFS+ formatted is quite secure against theft.<p>Regarding backups, my laptops usually rsync their /home every day to my remote server (and most data on them is in git repositories anyway).",1390554869

Typically you use an FFI to access particular functionality offered in libraries/classes only offered in another language.  In my experience it is only a temporary solution, a does-it-work test.  After that you need to recode.  Having said that, in my experience  Lua(JIT) does this pretty well with C libraries but Lua was designed as the scripting companion to C from day one.<p>The JVM offers a better place to tackle these issues.  Scala and Java cross calling is often more than adequate.  Perhaps a Julia compiler for the JVM could be a step in the right direction.",1390554773

If your video is over 2-2.30mins it&#x27;s too long!<p>-  When you use a simple, coherent story, you make it more likely that people will make a decision or take an action.<p>- On that note, there was no really strong call to action at the end of the video.<p>- If you&#x27;re selling to men (and sadly lets face it you mostly are), your call to action should be done by a woman.<p>- There is way too much text.<p>- Rewards tiers are too complex. There needs to be a clear &quot;you should buy this one&quot;. Each reward tier description is itself a little essay!<p>- &quot;VMX Project&quot; isn&#x27;t a good name. What does VMX mean? It&#x27;s not memorable. I don&#x27;t think that &#x27;project&#x27; is a positive word. It&#x27;s the kind of word you&#x27;d associate with a charity or shaky cause.<p>- You need to partner up more.

Why should I convert?<p>- You need to show the novelty. How does it differ from other similar but different products like Simple/Open CV etc.<p>- Going back to social proof, you don&#x27;t have any media or quotes!<p>Just my 2c :-)<p>Please repost your project. \nIt&#x27;s really quite awesome, it just needs to be marketed better!",1390554754

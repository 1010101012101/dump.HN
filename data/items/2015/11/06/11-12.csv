There are a number of really nice carbon fibre fiddles in the &quot;serious&quot; price range that may give up a teeny-tiny fraction of the absolute best that can be achieved with the best woods, the best varnishes, the best luthiers, the best alignment of the stars and the correct sequence of profanities and vulgarities uttered during the production process, but for that minor loss you get excellent instrument-to-instrument consistency and the ability to play with the same sound under wildly varying conditions of temperature and humidity. Part of the problem with acceptance is that once the price gets high enough, people want &quot;a real one&quot;, and Cremona never smelled much like carbon fibre.<p>Boosey & Hawkes used to make a wonderful series of woodwinds (clarinets and oboes) in aligned glass-fibre-reinforced resin with the same sort of advantages - and disadvantages - with one extra little niggle: they weighed a bloody ton. (I owned a B&H clarinet I haven&#x27;t picked up in a little over 20 years.

I have ran into numerous issues with it which has meant I have to currently abandon hope of porting this C++ library across to it.<p>Issues I have ran into:<p>a. I can either run the emulator with resume support and no GPU acceleration so that it is dog-slow to use, or have GPU acceleration and the very slow startup of the emulator.<p>b. On my Mac, it will randomly not install or find the device with adb (oddly intermittent!).<p>c. The emulator does not support WiFi, meaning monitoring apps that rely on wireless and multicast and the wireless interface being there are impossible to debug (the app makes checks for the wireless interface being available and uses its address to join an interface lower in C++ land). What&#x27;s the point of the emulator, I hear you ask?<p>d. You have to jump through Gradle hoops to stop the ndk-build system generating its own build script and to get it to respect your existing Android.mk and Application.mk files. Getting it to build static libs involves bulding shared libs and then adding another build command to include that static lib into your dummy shared lib. Static libs that you build in a build process will not be automatically copied to the APK library - only shared ones will.<p>e. My application is having problems with OpenGL textures early on but breakpoints for NDK C++ apps will NOT be hit until 10 seconds after program startup...... this is really rubbish; I can&#x27;t stress how unfathomably lame this is.<p>f. Android Device Monitor (DDMS) does not support networking monitoring for Intel images (<a href=""https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=25997"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=25997</a>) so you can either have a fast Intel emulator with no network monitoring support, or you can use the dog-slow ARM software emulator with network monitoring support, with the caveats that the wireless interface you depend on will be missing from the emulator, and that your breakpoints during program setup will not be hit etc. etc. etc.<p>g.

I think that that would be a very foolish approach to the problem.<p>There is a very big risk that geo-engineering is perceived as a magical patch that will fix the problem - it can&#x27;t fix the problem, but perhaps it can alleviate some of the symptoms. Any particular geo-engineering approach will have secondary implications (perhaps unanticipated, like the whole global warming thing).<p>It isn&#x27;t realistic to think that we can completely reverse the changes we&#x27;ve set in motion - no reverse, only forward, into new and interesting (and potentially non-adaptable) conditions we haven&#x27;t yet experienced as a species.",1446808323

Rust macros can be used like C++ templates (minus autoinstantiation) and they can take other macros as parameters. It&#x27;s not as nice as C++, but ... workable.<p>Patrick is talking about HKTs which can be typechecked at the source, similar to the rest of Rust generics, when he talks about &quot;they want to create typeclasses that abstract over types of a higher kind and only those types&quot;. C++ templates get typechecked at use-time, not instantiation-time, like Rust macros. On the other hand, Rust forces you to constrain types in generics (a la C++ &quot;concepts&quot;) so that it typechecks at the source (and then the contract for types being passed into the function is clear in the signature). We don&#x27;t have higher kinded bounds, though.<p>HKT, after all, is a comment on bounds. What sort of things are you allowed to substitute for this generic or template parameter?<p>What seems to be happening here is a difference of opinion on what constitutes a &quot;bound&quot;, in the C++ world a &quot;structural&quot; bound (i.e. type vs number vs template) is all you have. In the Rust world this isn&#x27;t considered a bound, since the bound isn&#x27;t type-safe. In the Rust world, Haskell world, and most other worlds where the word &quot;kind&quot; is used, a bound is a &quot;type&quot; (typeclass) bound and is type safe -- you can only do operations on the parameter which the bounds let you. Many Rust/Haskell people would consider C++ templates to be a particularly awesome macro system (but not a generics system); since they&#x27;re structural-bound (like Rust macros); not type-safe.<p>Really a matter of terminology though.",1446808170

We&#x27;ve been watching them over the years and have been impressed with some of the work they&#x27;ve delivered.  I&#x27;ve also met a few of their employees and have liked their thinking around selling digital goods and where it&#x27;s going.  You could see they wanted to make a success of the company.<p>Their problems, in my opinion, have come from being VC backed.  VCs ultimately want thier money back and with this comes massive, often unrealistic growth expectations.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of offers of VC money for SendOwl over the years but I&#x27;ve never once considered taking it.  I&#x27;ve bootstrapped SendOwl because I wanted complete control of the company, to direct where I thought it should go, to create the company where I wanted to work at (we work a sensible 9-5, I spend lunchtimes hitting the gym...), but most importantly to serve our customers and build something for the long term.  This last part is something I&#x27;ve always seen as uncompatabile with the VC model.<p>The VC model is alluring though - VC money makes growing quickly easier, it makes getting PR easier and it makes bringing in lots of staff early on an easy decision.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s right or wrong per say, it&#x27;s just not the path I wanted to go down.  Bootstrapping isn&#x27;t as sexy as VC money, but as long as we&#x27;re growing, getting great customer feedback, and innovating with new features I know we&#x27;re on the right path.  Focus on those three things with Boostrapping and it&#x27;s hard to go far wrong to be honest.<p>Interestingly we&#x27;re getting more and more people asking about us as a company and whether we&#x27;ll be around long term, so maybe the tide is starting to turn.

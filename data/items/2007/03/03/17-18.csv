2012,comment,1990,1990,0,0,amichail,,,"The problem with collaborative filtering is that there's a lot of magic going on that the user does not understand. Some users like to have more control over personalized recommendations and social networks can give them that control.",1172942839
2011,comment,1952,1952,0,0,python_kiss,,,"Here is my comment on Mashable: None of these social networks present a viable business model to be attractive from a shareholders point of view.<p>That said, I think all similar startups should hold off until Facebook or LinkedIn go for their IPO. Bebos valuation would sufficiently increase or decrease depending on how other players in this market perform.",1172942453
2010,comment,2005,2005,0,0,python_kiss,,,"I am guessing Ning already has the upper hand in this niche. Perhaps if this application had launched a few months ago, it would have made similar waves as Ning.",1172942349
2009,comment,1987,1996,0,0,sly,,,"Lots of startups may be a single programmer, but my understanding is that the most successful ones have 2 to 4 (http://paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html).

Google has some great research publications as well that I recommened everyone checkout: http://labs.google.com/papers.html<p>They have an amazing collection of research papers based on their products. Personally, I recommend ""Evaluating similarity measures: a large-scale study in the Orkut social network"" as a preliminary mathematical introduction to user interfaces.",1172942235
2006,comment,1987,1996,0,0,lucks,,,"Perhaps some of the 12 tests/tips are.  But I think there is some good stuff in there for solo or small-team projects.  I myself have never used a bug tracker, but I sure have spent a lot of time coming up with some sort of solution for that problem.  These solutions get pretty hodge-podge after a while (wiki's, email, white boards, notes, etc.), and I am never satisfied.

6411043,comment,6403285,6410494,2,0,redhat-reallyp,,,"> <i>poof magic we have simple mathematical rules on which the universe runs</i><p>I&#x27;m not arguing against the idea that the universe might be <i>described by</i> simple mathematical rules - after all, we have a fair amount of evidence that it can be, for some value of &quot;simple&quot;.  But it&#x27;s an enormous unsupported jump from there to the idea that the mere possibility of such rules somehow gives rise to a universe that follows them, ex nihilo, or variations on that idea.<p>Generally, such handwaving is not accompanied by much serious exposition.  Even Tegmark&#x27;s writing on the subject doesn&#x27;t get into it in enough depth to seriously evaluate.  It&#x27;s an amusing conjecture, but I&#x27;m not aware of anyone having developed it beyond that point.<p>It&#x27;s also strangely reminiscent of other attempts to delegate the creation of the universe to a mysterious unexplained force: is &quot;mathematics did it&quot; really any different than &quot;a god did it&quot; as an explanation?  Neither are actually explanations, they just give the superficial appearance of explanation via a sleight of hand in which the entity in question is implicitly assumed to somehow have the necessary wherewithal to do the job it&#x27;s accused of.  To me, &quot;mathematics did it&quot; is about as good an explanation as &quot;the Great Penguin did it&quot;.<p>> <i>Now, assuming our universe does run on math, it is quite impossible to test for different kinds of ontological existence. Do we live in a simulation? If the simulation isn&#x27;t buggy, we don&#x27;t stand a chance at root escalation, and we can&#x27;t tell. Does the mathematical rules exist, like &quot;poof magic&quot;, or do they need some exterior force or entity to be actualized? Again, we can&#x27;t tell, because there&#x27;s just no way out of our universe.</i><p>I agree with this mostly, although again I&#x27;ll point out that the entire idea of seeing our <i>models</i> of the universe as being somehow responsible for its creation runs the risk of being a huge category error, so I don&#x27;t take it for granted that the universe actualizes mathematical rules in that sense.  The rules we like to model may simply be an occasionally emergent property of a chaotic physical substrate, and we find ourselves in a predictable corner of some randomly organized multiverse by virtue of the anthropic principle.<p>But to your larger point that it&#x27;s likely to be impossible to test the ontological status of mathematical rules, that&#x27;s a major part of why strong claims in this area seem incoherent to me.<p>> <i>Occam&#x27;s razor doesn&#x27;t favour surface simplicity, it favours simplicity at the deepest level.</i><p>Occam&#x27;s Razor is a simple heuristic that has no such bias.  The only simplicity it favors is the removal of redundant aspects of a model, and redundancy can exist anywhere, whether superficial or deep.  Further, &quot;redundant&quot; can be relative to one&#x27;s purposes.  Many physical models are deliberate simplifications of the phenomena being modeled, e.g. gases, fluid flow.  This often seems to be forgotten when people start to confuse mathematical models of the universe with the universe itself.<p>> <i>By the way, didn&#x27;t you notice that you&#x27;re not surprised all the time? That emotion isn&#x27;t as irrational as a Straw Vulcan would believe.</i><p>I distinguish between everyday claims, like someone telling me they went to a movie, and claims about new discoveries about the universe.  You don&#x27;t need to revise your theories about the universe to provisionally accept the claim that someone went to a movie, for example.<p>But a claim that entails revision of a theory needs to be treated differently, and in that context, being &quot;unsurprising&quot; is not really particularly relevant - such claims can and should be evaluated on the basis of whether they are supported sufficiently strongly.<p>> <i>Heck, I have emotions, I might as well use them.</i><p>I disagree with using them to justify a conclusion about the validity of a scientific claim.  Certainly many people seem to operate on this basis, but it leads to a great deal of irrational behavior.<p>> <i>You should read Probability Theory: The Logic of Science. It&#x27;s an excellent book.</i><p>Thanks, I&#x27;ll check it out.",1379591476

6411032,comment,6410682,6410895,7,0,moron4hire,,,"I used to work on simulations of industrial lifting cranes. Crane operators would use the simulator to plan a lift before going out into the field to execute it. This was &#x27;round about 2008, when New York City had all of those cranes fall over in one year. Luckily, none of them were any of our customers, but every day was a new test of patience as we waited on the news to tell us what company was responsible so we could check out customer list.[1]<p>I&#x27;m now working on DOT road signing systems. The software I am writing will be used to figure out when and where to put up speed limit and warning signs.<p>What is really, super concerning is that, though I am capable of doing all of the math and physics that the job requires (and there is really no reason for you to believe me on that point, which makes the situation even worse), none of the other programmers I&#x27;ve ever worked with on these projects could.[2]  The companies that hired me just got lucky that I typically go with the least-effort job application process and am too lazy to be constantly applying to jobs.

As far as I was concerned, the fact that none of our own customers had been in the news was mere luck and I had no interest in being on watch with my hands tied behind my back when it finally did happen.<p>[2]  The <i>most recent</i> fun defect I had to fix involved someone having added two angles together, one in degrees, the other in radians.

6410959,comment,6406179,6406179,3,0,jackgavigan,,,"This is quite exciting news.<p>I&#x27;ve been running Cyanogenmod (CM) on my NinjaTel phone (a HTC One V) for a year now and it&#x27;s been an interesting experience that has led me to think a lot more about the nature of a smartphone operating system and how the current offerings are positioned - e.g. the completely closed, manufacturer-controlled iOS versus the open (in theory but, in reality, controlled by the mobile network operators) Android.<p>The path by which a new version of Android currently makes its way onto the average user&#x27;s phone is tortuous. First, Google release the new version of Android, then the chipmakers have to support it, then the phone manufacturers have to create a new release which must be tested by the mobile network operators (MNOs) before they will release it to their users.<p>The fact that Apple owns makes both the hardware and software (and refused to let the MNOs customise iOS[1]) has allowed them to streamline the process so that, when they release a new version of iOS, it has already been tested with their partner MNOs networks and can be delivered direct to their customers&#x27; devices (and note that Apple regards iPhone owners as /Apple&#x27;s/ customers, not the MNOs&#x27;).<p>I guess that, without first mover advantage and with multiple, competing hardware manufacturers, Google was unable to strike the same sort of deal that Apple did. Fortunately, Google have finally recognised that this puts Android at a disadvantage and have started shifting functionality into apps that can be upgraded via the Play store[2].)<p>In any case, the general public have slowly come to realise that (a) the phone and the network are not inextricably tied, and (b) the functionality of a phone (i.e. the apps it can run) is not dictated by the phone&#x27;s OS.<p>Logically, the next step is to recognise that phone device and operating system are not inextricably linked - i.e. when you buy an Android device, you can replace the pre-installed OS with something else. However, that&#x27;s quite a big step for the general public to take. The average consumer still regards consumer electronics products as a single package. It would need to become exceedingly easy and very clearly advantageous for them to consider replacing their stock OS. Just think about how many average consumers who buy laptops replace the default install of Windows with Linux.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that it will never happen, just that it&#x27;s not going to happen overnight and CM have a lot of work to do to build a viable and sustainable business around supplying their version of Android direct to retail consumers.<p>In the meantime, one customer segment that Cyanogenmod should definitely be looking at are large corporates, who want to be able to customise the phones they give their employees (e.g. to tie into internal mail systems, employee directories, route calls via the company&#x27;s internal network, etc.). BlackBerry has been a leader in this space but uncertainty over the company&#x27;s future means that some clients are potentially open to approached from an alternative supplier [3], particularly one that is not inextricably linked to a particular manufacturer or network.<p>They could also attract the interest of mobile virtual network operators. Personally, I think it&#x27;s just a matter of time before we see an MVNO that abstracts voice calls towards a least cost routing model that takes advantage of data connectivity to make VoIP calls (instead of traditional phone calls) when it&#x27;s cheaper to do so. CM would be well-positioned to provide the OS for this type of service (although, if Microsoft had any common sense, they&#x27;d already be doing this now with Skype).<p>In the meantime, it will be interesting to see how Google (and, indeed, the manufacturers) react to Cyanogenmod&#x27;s incorporation. Specifically, I&#x27;ll be interested to see whether Google strike the same sort of deal with Cyanogenmod that they have with Mozilla (i.e. search royalties)<p>Footnotes:<p>[1: Apple (specifically Jobs himself) were only able to refuse to allow the MNOs (and specifically AT&T) to customise iOS because the iPhone was such a ground-breaking product. RIM, for example, also made both the hardware and software for the Blackberry but were forced to allow the MNOs to customise the OS.]<p>[2: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/09/balky-carriers-and-slow-oems-step-aside-google-is-defragging-android/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/09/balky-carriers-and-sl...</a> ]<p>[3: Morgan Stanley Reportedly Holding Off on BlackBerry 10 Upgrade: <a href=""http://n4bb.com/morgan-stanley-reportedly-holding-blackberry-10-upgrade/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://n4bb.com/morgan-stanley-reportedly-holding-blackberry...</a> ]",1379589940

2. Register with the RBI and get stamped from them every time you remit money from outside India <-- painful
3. Not be able to use a majority of payment gateways that collect payments in foreign currency if you want to directly tie it to your Indian co.
4. Process ESI if you&#x27;re paying under $400/mo
5. Process PF if  you&#x27;re paying over $400/mo and have more than 10 employees<p>It&#x27;s paperwork, paperwork and more paperwork!<p>As for being late to the party, cost of labor has gone up at least 4 times in the past 10 years and it&#x27;s going to probably go up another 3 times in the next five years. Smart people are no longer that easy to find and very few folks actually are interested in working for startups. Cost of infrastructure, electricity, broadband, everything is higher in Bangalore and more at par with Austin or Boston tbh.",1379588432

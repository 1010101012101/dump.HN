Laptop screens from ~7(?) years ago have LVDS deserializer chip on the Tcon pcb (DS90C562/SN75LVDS86), you can desolder that and connect directly to parallel bus. Never screens integrated Flatlink(lvds) receiver inside main lcd driver chip.<p>LVDS is just serialized parallel video. Serializer chips are ~$5 in singles on Mouser. Combining Pee DPI output with SN75LVDS84 ($2.5 if you order 10 from china) will allow you to connect any modern <=1366x768 resolution (single lvds channel limit) Laptop LCD screen.

That implies a larger set of probability functions, sure, some of it from genetic evolution, some from the evolution of thoughts. Reason draws from its intelligence from emotion, ie. emotional intelligence, though. There&#x27;s convolution of primary senses, finely tuned, highly developed mechanisms and chemical reactions that motivate the strategic management you mentioned.<p>In that sense, what we percieve as intelligent often enough is the abillity to do more with less, ie. compression of information.

Murder for example. But any idea that&#x27;s considered harmless in a significant percentage of times and places, and yet is taboo in ours, is a good candidate for something we&#x27;re mistaken about.<p>Again, from his essay on taboos. [1] Most everything you&#x27;ve cited as an objective wrong was practically universally considered an objective good nary 60 years ago. The morality around slavery was so murky that a years-long civil war was fought between the opposing sides on that issue. Are we just supposed to believe that everyone that lived south of the Mason-Dixon line was naturally insipid, evil, and amoral? As PG states, unless it&#x27;s universally regarded as evil across all (or nearly all) civilizations, it&#x27;s very likely that a particular taboo does not cross into the &quot;objectively evil&quot; territory. Slavery has been pretty widespread throughout human history, so that should clue you in that there are possible morally sympathetic readings of it (which usually hinge on the belief that the enslaved group is naturally inferior and couldn&#x27;t survive without the master group).<p>>As always, if it were about kids and reproduction, we wouldn&#x27;t allow infertile and senior couples to marry.<p>I disagree based on two important elements. Heterosexual couples could become fertile at any time; you never know when infertility will reverse itself if the couple is otherwise healthy and under 40. Post-menopausal women or other permanently sterile heterosexual partners are OK because they are examples that reinforce the need for permanent heterosexual coupling and family structure, even if they are unable to produce children on their own, and secondarily, they can provide a natural parenting context with male-female parental duality, as biologically mandated, if they ever obtain a ward. Homosexual sexual activity can never result in reproduction and can not provide the male-female parental duality that is necessary to produce a child by natural means.<p>Marriage is really about all of society, and not really about the couple that gets married. It is fine for one to believe that gay marriage is beneficial, but it&#x27;s not fine to pretend like there is no change in the behavior endorsed and that opposition is based solely on discriminatory motives. Whatever you say you are, or whatever you actually are, heterosexual coupling and homosexual coupling are two different behaviors that could have differing ramifications on society as a whole. Thus, the cost-benefit is worthy of some consideration, and differing opinions are fine, even using a standard that disallows all &quot;discriminatory&quot; rationale (which standard can&#x27;t really be considered an objective good either).<p>I&#x27;m not really trying to escalate this into a debate on gay marriage, but I think it&#x27;s important to delineate the logic that gay rights campaigners fight hard to obscure. Gay rights advocates don&#x27;t want a conversation to get started; they just want everyone to believe that their opponents are naturally evil, so they go around and make a frowny face until it gets people like Brendan Eich kicked out of jobs, and they can then point at Eich and say &quot;He was so evil he got fired! Only evil people would dare oppose us&quot;.<p>Perhaps you don&#x27;t believe a male-female parental duality is important. Perhaps you don&#x27;t believe that marriage is an institution that deserves state protection or benefits. Perhaps you don&#x27;t see any meaning in the evolutionary imperative that children can only be produced by opposite-sex partners. All of this is well and good. You are welcome to your beliefs. The important thing is to accept that others are welcome to their beliefs too, even if they differ from yours, and that that doesn&#x27;t automatically make <i>them</i> &quot;lesser human beings&quot; (or &quot;bigots&quot;, the currently popular shorthand).<p>>The government should clearly not be subsidizing relationships at all, but since it is, it must do so fairly. Even our insane Supreme Court realized this vis-a-vis DOMA. The 14th amendment is very clear.<p>The 14th Amendment is anything but &quot;very clear&quot;, and again, the fact that there have been so many differing interpretations of it is evidence that its meaning and implications are debatable by reasonable persons. It&#x27;s a bad, broad law.<p>[1]  <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html</a>",1425617002

Unfortunately, all the data I have on this I left behind at my ex-employer (Google), and I don&#x27;t yet have time to write the code to compile new data.<p>The short answer is that the DOM is not slow.  Adding & removing a DOM node is a few pointer swaps, not much more than setting a property on the JS object.<p>However, <i>layout</i> is slow.  When you touch the DOM <i>in any way</i>, you set a dirty bit on the whole tree that tells the browser it needs to figure out where everything goes again.  When JS hands control back to the browser, it invokes its layout algorithm (or more technically, it invokes its CSS recalc algorithm, <i>then</i> layout, then repaint, then re-compositing) to redraw the screen.  The layout algorithm is quite complex - read the CSS spec to understand some of the rules - and that means it often has to make non-local decisions.<p>Worse, layout is triggered synchronously by accessing certain properties.  Among those are getComputedStyleValue(), getBoundingClientWidth(), .offsetWidth, .offsetHeight, etc, which makes them stupidly easy to run into.  Full list is here (possibly a few years out of date):<p><a href=""http://gent.ilcore.com/2011/03/how-not-to-trigger-layout-in-webkit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gent.ilcore.com/2011/03/how-not-to-trigger-layout-in-...</a><p>Because of this, a lot of Angular and JQuery code is stupidly slow.  One layout will blow your entire frame budget on a mobile device.  When I measured Google Instant c. 2013, it caused <i>13 layouts</i> in one query, and locked up the screen for nearly 2 seconds on a mobile device.  (It&#x27;s since been sped up.)<p>React doesn&#x27;t help speed up layout - if you want butter-smooth animations on a mobile web browser, you need to resort to other techniques like limiting everything you do in a frame to operations that can be performed on the GPU.  But what it does do is ensure that there is at most one layout performed each time you update the state of the page.  That&#x27;s often quite an improvement on the status quo.<p>(Standard disclaimer: this was all current as of the beginning of 2014, but browsers change fast, and it may or may not be current now.  Much of the current pitiful performance of major JS frameworks is because they were built with assumptions on browser performance that were true in 2008, but aren&#x27;t now.)",1425616653

This is a basic principle of a separation-of-powers democracy.

Citizens and others can petition the justice system to make government documents public. Unless the justice system and the federal government agree something can not be made public, it is made public.<p>This is extremely prominently mentioned on every computer system anywhere near the federal government. Record keeping requirements this, email archival that.<p>Ms. Hillary Clinton did not miss these requirements. She knowingly violated the law and conducted official government business in an illegal manner.

The sentiment expressed by Adria came up at the time, and was a big part of this interview (not sure how much faith we can put in the quotes attributed, but for the moment I&#x27;ll assume they are accurate).<p>Specifically the bit several other people have been drawn to and quoted in other threads here.<p>When asked how she felt about the impact on the guys involved:<p><pre><code>  &quot;Not too bad, he&#x27;s a white male. I&#x27;m a black Jewish female.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nI find this kind of attitude / rationalisation uncomfortable because it turns out that I am, through no fault of my own, part of the demographic identified as inherently worthy of less empathy.<p>I suspect it&#x27;s meant to be more nuanced than this, however I conclude that either her thinking is fuddled, or she can&#x27;t properly express the sentiment - neither is ideal if the goal is to have a sensible conversation.",1425614490

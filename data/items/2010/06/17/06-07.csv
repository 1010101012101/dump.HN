The possibility Twitter cut Pixar a large deal on this in exchange for the ad offering some real adnetwork validity/proof of large, successful customers (which will see huge box office #s, although how they correlate to this will be hard to measure).<p>It's really a strange play in general because Toy Story will undoubtedly become a trending topic once the movie is about to release, so I have considerable doubts that Pixar made this move for any significant dollar amount.",1276757622

1438167,comment,1437447,1438113,0,0,houseabsolute,,,"> But holding the debate hostage with demands for ethical impossibilities is somehow okay?<p>It's not an ethical impossibility. It's a pragmatic imperative. AND it's the root of the entire conversation. It's what I started this comment tree about! How can it possibly be holding up the debate to talk about it?<p>> b) Some other, smaller, amount along with a list of the effects you have discounted from the full amount and justification for such discounting.<p>Well it's certainly got to be this one since reversing every effect is entropically impossible. Some obvious things I don't really care about are restoring BPs bottom-line to its pre-disaster levels. As a general rule I'm also not interested in paying to mitigate damage to wildlife that would fall under ICUN's Least Concern designation (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Concern"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Concern</a>) even after all harm to populations from the spill are taken into account. I feel this way except inasmuch as human beings depend on such wildlife for economic sustenance. Although it sucks that the animals die, if they are not used directly by humans the utility lost when a common animal dies is typically far less than the cost of saving it in an oil spill like this.<p>Endangered animals I do want to protect, but once again there's a line somewhere (I don't know where) where their protection costs more than its worth. For example, if there is a rare mosquito in the marshes of southern Louisiana that ends up being wiped out entirely because of this crisis, I would not assign a cost of a billion dollars to that lost. Some cost, yes, but not a billion dollars.<p>If the oil slick bears out to be very large but cause small or questionable harm across a huge region, I also don't think we should necessarily spend money compensating the victims of such small harms. (For example, even if the oil spill stopped now some amount of oil would probably disperse even as far as the west coast of the U.S. after enough time.) To assign a metric, if the amount of compensation we might provide to a given victim is less than ten times the administrative cost of giving that compensation, we should not compensate.<p>Looking at the worst case scenario: let's say that the entire gulf becomes unfishable for the next fifty years except if the U.S. spends a quarter of its total output during that time period cleaning it up. Obviously this would be a really bad trade because the fishing in that region accounts for a much smaller portion of GDP than a quarter. BP should have to pay to support the people in that region, but realistically even the profits of an oil giant like BP would quickly be quenched under such a deluge of liability. Maybe the government can help them move and pay for their retraining, but in the end there is no point throwing good money after bad. They would need to do something else or maybe relocate to another place.<p>Obviously all these numbers are sketches. I can hardly tell you what the actual numbers are (if you'll recall, my initial comment was a request for speculation on what that number might be). But there is no question that there is a number, or a range of reasonable numbers, to describe the cost of this disaster.<p>> Alternatively, you can be gracious and concede the point that if there are alternatives to high-risk offshore oil wells . . .<p>That is not even a point under discussion. Why did you bring it up? What makes you think I support offshore drilling? We are talking about whether it makes sense to assign a numeric cost to the disaster, which it obviously does.",1276756940

I believe that the algorithm that our brains (and that of most animals) use is a very simple one that just needs tremendous parallel processing. I don't think anyone including IBM is yet thinking at that level (they work at too high a level for my tastes) and they do not consider enough of biology in their work (too computer-science-y, which prevents problem solving at the beginning).<p>I think it's just a matter of time before the neuroscientists have most of the details of brain and neuron functioning and we're able to decode the algo and replicate it on computers.

Which is to say, it's one of those edge cases that the law, by design <i>has</i> to leave out, a situation where you have to violate the Constitution in order to save it, but there is no way in hell you're going to give any freedom within the law itself to do anything of the kind.

All custom packages are open source, and all changes made to other packages are published as well, according to the GPL. The ISO and VM builds are free to download and use, no strings attached what so ever.<p>The subscription you are referring to is currently free. 6 months ago we began soliciting feedback from the community regarding pricing [1]. You might want to take a look at the feedback we have received and the motivation behind adding a premium to the AMI images. We have yet to come to a decision though, so feedback is most definitely welcome.<p>In a nutshell, the idea is to fund development. When you use Amazon EC2, you are already charged on usage, so the idea is to add a reasonable mark-up on those fees so people who are using TurnKey give back a little bit into a pool which helps support the project and fund future development.<p>We believe this is a win-win for the community, because a premium would fund development of open source appliances rather than expensive and closed proprietary alternatives. To the casual user a few bucks here and there would hardly be noticed on their bill but multiply this thousands of times over and suddenly we have the resources to do much more for the project's users.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.turnkeylinux.org/polls/amazon-ec2-fees"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.turnkeylinux.org/polls/amazon-ec2-fees</a>",1276755982

The problem is that no one agrees on the meanings of the inputs.<p>It's a common fallacy to believe that computers can produce ""correct"" answers to questions which a sample of 1,000 (or even 2) humans don't give the same answers to. If you have nothing unambiguous or even statistically reasonable to compare your answers against, the experiment is unfalsifiable.<p>Human scientists (if they are such, and not just bottle-washers and button-sorters), pose questions and then experiment against reality, which is and always will be the final appeal. A computer ""scientist"" cannot avoid that -- they still have to simulate and experiment. Several do, actually. The best seem to be based on ""genetic algorithms"", ie, simulation and experiment, just faster.<p>So there are many things computers can do and will do. But expecting a computer to tell you whether abortion is right or wrong, or to run for president, or be a perfect oracle, is missing the point.

Also, files from you magically appear a block or two away when other people ask for them.  The sneakernet takes care of all the routing to make lots of files show up in lots of places geographically close to you without too much overhead.<p>I've found lots of times I will request a file that the system in its cleverness has already cached locally on my HD.

1879868,comment,1879395,1879758,0,0,gruseom,,,"I agree that standardized tests suck. I distinctly remember how much they suck. A system based on standardized tests is going to suck. But you know what sucks worse? Utterly incompetent teachers. If we can't even identify and get rid of the most egregious offenders - the kind who tell children ""I get paid whether you learn or not"" and then proceed to read the newspaper in front of the class -- what hope do we have?<p>Everyone always talks about how overwhelmingly complicated these problems are. No doubt that's true, especially if you accept certain premises. But there are also some no-brainers. The ideas that teachers get jobs for life, you can't fire a teacher for underperforming, and layoffs proceed in order of seniority are mind-bogglingly stupid and evil (as Rhee writes, running the schools ""for the benefit of the adults in the system, not for the benefit of the kids""). No one can tell me this hasn't had devastating effects.<p>If the best we can do right now is apply crude and mediocre metrics (like standardized tests) to stanch the social hemhorrage that is the failure of our public school system, we'd better do it. Real education, the kind that prepares whole human beings to do great things with their lives, is absolutely what we should shoot for; anyone working as an educator ought to have that in mind at all times. Nevertheless, a system that produces trained rats is not as evil as one that turns out prison fodder.",1289152635

Some of these could perhaps be consolidated similarly, and likewise in other regions.<p>FWIW, my first-hand experience in the UK is that none of the national carriers (not even UPS and FedEx!) is nearly as good as UPS and FedEx in America; the Royal Mail is just about as bad as the wretched US Postal Service.

1879828,comment,1879073,1879201,0,0,jwr,,,"I am a co-founder of a startup based in Poland and I disagree with ""unsatisfactory job opportunities"" you mention.<p>I think the job opportunities are there all right, and the startup culture is growing very rapidly. Problem is, young people (especially programmers) have unrealistic expectations, not in line with anything you might call a ""startup"".<p>First, most young people start working for large companies during the final years of their education. Then, right after they get their master's, they take on a mortgage. Which means from then on their work career is dictated by the requirement of a constant, predictable salary.<p>Second, when dealing with startups, programmers expect a) a high salary, b) extras. Start telling them about shares and options and see how the conversation doesn't go anywhere. Sure, it's sugar on top of their salary, but (a) is required. Their families and friends only understand (a), so (a) it is.<p>Third, and this is a European problem, rather than a local one, things happen slower over here. It is difficult to make people work hard and fast and if you do it, people will complain about unsatisfactory work environment.<p>So, in my opinion, if you are looking for startup job opportunities, there are plenty to be had, but don't expect corporate pay, benefits and work hours.<p>As to the original article, it is true and well-written (I know the people mentioned, it's a great team). Not everything is rosy, and it is difficult to run a startup across countries and timezones, but it can work out very, very well indeed.<p>And in my opinion, the biggest problem with the Polish startup scene is not the founders, but the relative immaturity of the angel and VC investors. If some of the foreign, more experienced VCs and angels decided to do business here, I'm sure they would find plenty of good opportunities.",1289151675

In <i>The Waste Land</i> the leaves of modern times are gathered, but no sense has been made, or some are missing. In fact, as the epigraph says, the Sybil 'wants to die.'

Allegro Common Lisp has traditionally been about as unfree as possible (e.g. $$$ required to distribute solutions to your customers (for the Lisp runtime)) and it's still around.  LispWorks is three years older and is still around.<p>Also, would the MIT Lisp Machine system or Genera have gotten as good as they did as fast as they did without outside funding (government and VC respectively)?<p>Or look at the failure of GNU to produce a kernel.<p>My general point here is that all this is much more complicated that a simple ""free survives, unfree doesn't"" ... although I'd need a few good examples of unfree dying to round out it out (good as in perhaps ""was big, then totally failed"").",1289149977

And the schools and residency programs are tyrannized by their students and residents scores. I gotta say, it doesn't take long to identify the docs who did well on those tests: they're generally the best docs. They're the most articulate, ask the most insightful questions during their patient interviews, develop the best diagnostic and management plans, and accomplish the most difficult research.<p>I suspect the same goes for lawyers, law programs, and their bar exams, engineers, engineering programs, and their EIT exams, etc. Why shouldn't kids learn to play by the same rules their parents do? Indeed, isn't that what kids want to do?",1289149890

1879746,comment,1878220,1879699,0,0,lispm,,,"I haven't said anything against his point. It is just that claiming that Stallman was the only one 'getting free software' is bullshit. He did a lot, but in the Lisp community there were many others which promote(d) free software.<p>Also Stallman did promote Free software, but his promotion of Lisp was mostly limited to Emacs Lisp. There was an attempt with Guile, but that was mostly it. He had worked with the Lisp Machine, but once he was out, that topic was finished.<p>Anyway, I find a few points are right and several others not. That Symbolics would have not gone out of business if Genera would have been free software and portable is speculation. It is neither necessary nor sufficient. For example Franz is still around, though Allegro CL is not free software. There are lots of free software / portable Lisp implementations which are as dead as Genera, or more than dead. I agree that it might help, but not more.<p>I agree with the following: portability and 'free' can help with survival.<p>I don't think adding C to Lisp is of much help. The mismatch is huge. There are two options: 1) repeating the design of the past (with the same problems and maybe slight improved. There has been lots of talk and little action. It's difficult because we don't have the hackers with knowledge and time for that. 2) doing a new design which gets rid of the limitations of past designs (single user, single image, no security, ...). That's even more difficult.",1289149859

Stallman completely abandoned the Lisp community at that point - he won't even talk about Lisp now (at least he told me to go away last time I tried talking to him about it).<p>What I'm saying is Stallman is right about the value of Free Software. CMUCL and BSD basically got released the way they did because they were university research projects that failed to get commercialized. Stallman is really the person that came out and said Free Software should be a priority in and of itself and not an accident. That totally changed the way you can think about software, and you shouldn't discount that.<p>Another thing I respect about Stallman is that he tends to be right about longer-term trends. I don't bet against him anymore.",1289149855
1879744,comment,1874064,1875348,0,0,frankus,,,"There are certainly markets where it basically isn't possible to make a living pricing things at marginal cost, which is why we have copyright law. There are also markets with large sunk research costs (i.e. the Kinect) where there needs to be a mechanism to recoup them, which is why we have patent law.<p>So I'm not particularly sympathetic to people feel like they shouldn't have to pay for a copy of something just because the marginal cost is zero. Leaving aside details like perpetual copyrights on the installment plan, we have a decent legal framework that only works if everyone contributes (cf. taxes).<p>But game consoles, to borrow your phrasing, are a field notorious for generating a feeling of entitlement among corporations. Same with printer cartridges, mobile phones, and, yes, razorblades. There is no societal need for these pricing schemes when we have an efficient consumer credit market, and they're frankly anticompetitive.<p>Society benefits from competitive markets, and competitive markets work best when things are forced to be priced at what they're worth. So I would argue that society benefits when loss-leader schemes are rendered infeasible.",1289149787

Why would anyone think that 10 more years wouldn't bring this again?  Quantum computing is looking more and more likely, with progress almost every month now.<p>Sure, today they couldn't crack it...  But this data has ramifications for many years to come.  It should never have been gathered together and put in a public place.<p>Behind the government's firewalls, it was protected by an ever-changing system.  If things get easier to crack, they can upgrade it.  As a simple file, it can never be changed.  It will also be there.<p>And finally, security experts will tell you that one of the easiest ways to crack something is the human factor.  That password is written down somewhere, and wikileaks isn't a fort.  Hackers could have gotten that password from wikileaks without them knowing.<p>So no, I don't think I do underestimate it.",1315227564

Unless they started doing that now (and judging by <a href=""https://services.mozilla.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://services.mozilla.com/</a> it seems like they don't), it'd still be much more of a hassle to set up a new FF install to be equivalent.<p>2.

I don't like semantic search because you have to scan the suggested result to check that the first search result is in fact whatever you expected it to be. When I type ""hn"" and press enter, I don't have to wait for semantic search to do its thing, I don't have to make sure that some other site that starts with ""h"" or has an ""h"" in the name took the top result spot (and what if you have multiple pages you visit often that start with ""h""?), I KNOW it will take me directly where I want to go.

The other three, sure. But I just do not come across any kind of website offering a service that violates these principles. You could throw a brick and find any website that violates guidelines for people with blindness or mental illness. You'd have to search for specific audio-based sites to find ones that discriminate against deaf folks (I can't see how HN does so, for example, but I may be missing something). But you'd have to go through a lot of service-offering sites to find a serious one that caused problems for epileptics.<p>The only kind of violation of these principles I could think of is a bug anyway - the issue where a mouseover changes the shape of a menu, moving it out from under the pointer, reverting the menu back to original shape, repeat ad infinitum.<p>Apart from that, I just don't see websites that cause problems. Served ads on some low class websites, perhaps (999999!), but not the content that the website itself is providing.<p>Solutions for epileptics to use poorly designed sites (if they were a real problem like they are for the blind) are here anyway - [Esc] in pretty much every browser cancels image animation. Flashblock kills flash dead, allowing you to throttle it to your needs. If you're really, really susceptible to simple movement as an epileptic (I've never heard of it, but it could happen, I guess - see the orange circle guy), you can install noscript, which breaks a lot of websites, but kills non-image animation dead. But if you're that susceptible, you're extremely rare and the web probably shouldn't be designed around your use case.<p><i>It seems you have an uphill battle to fight if mentioning epilepsy and accessibility in one sentence gets up your nose.</i><p>Please read my comment again.

Even for those who fully go through it, you have to question, at least up through basic college, what kind of an education they are really getting for the price they are paying.<p>Unfortunately, a solid education system in most every part of the world (especially in places like India and China) requires following a rigid architecture with little room for creative thinking. But this, with some exception, by and large creates a population of drones.<p>Creative thinking is what is required for innovation - and innovation creates new industries and employment. It's one of the reasons we've done so well despite a relatively lackluster basic education system.<p>I do hope our system improves somewhat - I've felt a better educated population would make better decisions when they are voting, although I'm not as convinced of that anymore - but a good education begins at home, not in the schools, and until people realize this, nothing is going to change.",1315225709
2962003,comment,2960687,2960687,8,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Something was bugging me about this article. After writing 3 potential comments, then deleting them all, I finally got it.<p>This is formulaic.<p>I have seen this article, or radio stories like it, over and over again over the past few years. As I understand the situation, in the United States we decided to have common tests for reading and writing -- you cannot manage what you do not measure -- and since then, the people being measured have written dozens or hundreds of variations on this theme.<p>The formula goes something like this: pick a topic not covered by the tests. Could be music, history, science, or civics. Demonstrate how poorly students are doing in this area. Demonstrate (or just give a good rant) about how important this area is for the future of our society. Complain about teachers having to teach so much to the tests and how bad that is. Argue that getting rid of the tests would free up time and resources so that we could regain some of what we desperately need.<p>There are many logical problems here. First there is the problem of limited resources. We must make funding decisions and choose some things to emphasize over others. Governance is about making choices. Second, and it amazes me that this isn't obvious, unless you can read and write effectively your choices in life are severely restricted. A good reader and writer who shows an interest in science, art, underwater basket weaving or whatever? They can go learn more. They can choose a subject, dive in, and self-educate. Somebody who is functionally illiterate but loves Beethoven? Aside from a kid with nice tastes, whose life is probably a tiny bit happier, we're not accomplishing much. Reading and writing are multipliers in a way other subjects are not. If you don't like or agree with that position, fine. Then choose something else you want to stress. Then measure it. Waving your arms around about how important each and every subject is does not constitute a system of making choices.<p>I am especially befuddled with this argument about teachers teaching to the tests. It's as if we are using the way teachers act as some kind of rationale for justifying the testing -- which is exactly backwards. Obviously we've had teachers create literate students over the past several hundred years without testing, and they didn't teach to the test. Why do we assume that because teachers are acting a certain way now that it is in their best interests to do so? Maybe most systems of teachers just don't know how to educate kids, and focusing on testing is the only thing they've got? If so, then we need to improve education systems, not eliminate the measurement. You don't make people better basketball players by taking away the scoreboard. I have no idea why this reasoning passes as informed logic in this debate.<p>My opinion as an interested observer is that once we actually starting measuring how poor of a job we do, all hell has broken loose. Not surprisingly, there's a huge push to stop measuring. This is not a good idea.<p>Yes, science literacy is a great thing. Let's work on general literacy first, then take whatever resources we have left over and instill a love for science. General literacy will get you a lot farther than scientific literacy will. (I also have some serious questions about what passes for scientific literacy which I'll save for another day.)",1315225708

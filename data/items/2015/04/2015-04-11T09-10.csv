For legal, there was a huge fear that anything we released or contributed to could open us up to liability; so there was a huge, undefined, process to get anything approved. With upper management, I think the issue was that by releasing something we might be giving away a competitive advantage or insights into our operations — that&#x27;s the impression I was given but can&#x27;t say absolutely.<p>It&#x27;s not a far stretch to imagine similar corporate thinking at Amazon.",1428746063

And it is without any question in my mind that the issues over what exactly &quot;free software&quot; means have been one of the biggest barriers to involvement - people think they&#x27;re breaking the law, or should break the law, or don&#x27;t have a right to unpack tarballs, or are afraid of looking at the source, or don&#x27;t think its &#x27;safe&#x27; to link to something in /usr/lib, and so on and so forth.  Getting this sorted out at the beginning of the course means that the student is prepared for the real knowledge transfer to be gained by having access to the sources for everything.<p>Its important, if you want to become a power Linux user, to understand your rights and just how much freedom you actually have, and to discard any preconceived/propagandized stigma you have about the subject.",1428745667

9358982,comment,9358548,9358883,0,0,kriro,,,"76240 Euro in Germany. There are no listed tax credits.
For company cars it&#x27;s 500 Euro/kWh maxing out at 10k in 2013 then -50/kWh and -500 total each year so this year we&#x27;d be at 400 Euro/kWh maxing at 9k. For Teslas the max is the only thing that matters because the battery easily outpaces the max (28k for the 70D).
+20 Euro/month in tax credit = 9240 Euro less for an even 67k.
You can also get a 42 Euro/month credit if you use the car at home so that&#x27;s an extra ~500/year.<p>I&#x27;ve recently read about a consulting company that switched to Tesla company cars. The standard seems to be around Audi A6 level Diesels and the Tesla 
There was also some talk about image ramifications both positive (especially for IT consulting) and negative (especially for cost cutting consultants in rough times). Pretty sure they said the standard cars would have been quite a bit less expensive but they did it anyway because it&#x27;s a net+ for the image (+really cool :P). Interestingly they briefly mentioned that the move was a huge plus in recruiting talent. Only anecdotal evidence but they added it as a perk in the adds and it got talked about in every interview and was seen as a good driver for talent acquisition.<p>Lol consultants and all but I could see the same reasoning helping with recruiting programmers (we do love our tech toys after all)",1428745593

9358960,comment,9354653,9357866,0,0,drewmclellan,,,"Front-end editing is one of those features that sounds like a good idea, and makes for good demo, but has some fundamental failings.<p>1) It sets up an expectation for the user that they are editing content on a page, as if they were editing a Word document. But they&#x27;re not doing that. They&#x27;re editing content in a system that then happens to be output on that page. It might also be output in other places on the site, maybe in different presentations. This causes weird spookiness-at-a-distance issues where making a change in one places has unintended consequences in another. Essentially you&#x27;re presenting a metaphor of editing content on a page, but the metaphor is a lie.<p>2) It encourages the user to think about how the content _looks_ not what the content _says_. This is the same fundamental issue with WYSIWYG editors, where the user wants to make things big and red and underlined. And blinking. The role of a CMS user is to create content. The role of the web designer is to set up the system to publish that content in a way that communicates best according to the site&#x27;s objectives.<p>3) The way the page looks when someone is editing on a big screen isn&#x27;t necessarily how it looks to all visitors to the site. Even saying &quot;this is what your site looks like&quot; is a massive oversimplification. It&#x27;s not even straightforward to define what a &#x27;page&#x27; is on a modern site, and that&#x27;s only going to get more complex as the web evolves. Trying to tangle your editing interface in with an ever increasingly complex presentation layer is setting the user up for a world of hurt. And lies. Hurt and lies.<p>It&#x27;s simply not sustainable, nor a good idea to try to combine your content management and your presentation layer.",1428744714

Since circuit design is a very high upkeep activity (money required for software licenses, technology access, clusters for simulations, runs, testing etc) I was wondering how do small companies deal with these expenses. Since at this point my career goal is to continue developing my skills as an IC designer, do you think that choosing to work for a small company might be a suboptimal decision?<p>The second question is if you know any smaller companies which are looking for people with my profile (in Europe or USA).

Despite being a Windows user in my laptop (and IOS in my Ipad), I am not a &#x27;fanboy&#x27; of Microsoft - very far from that - but I think their phones are better than the market &#x27;says&#x27;. I was an early adopter of Chrome, as I saw a lot of potential in it, but they got their market share quite slow. I have the same &#x27;feeling&#x27; with windows phone. What is HN opinion?<p>Disclaimer: I don&#x27;t have any connection with Microsoft - It&#x27;s just genuine curiosity. I write this because every time I make more specific questions, I read in the comments that I&#x27;m paid to ask them, last one was about Meteor.",1428742960

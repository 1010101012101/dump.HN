8067205,comment,8064534,8065696,7,0,Nick-Craver,,,"> One must wonder, how much better this setup would of scaled had it been a more appropriate webserver stack such as Linux/BSD + Apache/Nginx or similar<p>I guess you&#x27;re gonna have to define &quot;more appropriate&quot; for me, I have a feeling we&#x27;ll have a fundamental disagreement there.  We could (and have) run the entirety of our peak load with 1 SQL server and 2 web servers (and not pegging them). Don&#x27;t forget we run with a <i>crazy</i> amount of headroom at all times, by design. I&#x27;m not sure how much better you picture that scaling on a linux environment.<p>> not as cheap as just paying your team to maintain the boxes<p>That makes <i>a lot</i> of assumptions about the team, their expertise, and what support issues would arise.<p>> I wonder how many times in the past few years SE has needed to call Microsoft for support<p>In the past 4 years I&#x27;ve been here? Twice. Both to report bugs in CTP versions of SQL server. At no cost, and we improved SQL server as a result of being testers. We have a very good relationship with Microsoft and talk to the developers that make the tools and platform we use in order to make life better for both of us. We do the same thing for redis, Elasticsearch, etc. It&#x27;s the same reason we open source almost all of the tools we make.<p>> If something like CentOS then there would be no support cost unless you need to bring in an outside contractor (for a particularly nasty issue)<p>We use CentOS for all our linux systems and are deploying new servers on CentOS 7 now.  We&#x27;ll me migrating the others in the coming months. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s free. Developer or sysadmin time to control Puppet deployments and such still eat some factor of time.<p>Nick Craver - Stack Exchange Sysadmin & Developer",1405997770

8067196,comment,8065608,8066892,4,0,TheLoneWolfling,,,"You can just fall back to a &quot;rope&quot; consisting of a single node for small strings.<p>One of the things I really like about what I call &quot;pseudo-immutable&quot; ropes (ropes that are not truly immutable, but to all appearances are - when you take a slice it modifies the original rope to maximize structure-sharing.) is that you get immunity to those subtle memory leaks on slicing &quot;for free&quot;.<p>I agree fully on length-prefixed strings. They are a lot better than null-terminated strings, in a bunch of ways. Regexes using DFAs though can be... problematic. You really want a NFA that&#x27;s converted to a DFA on-the-fly, with caching, or else you can end up with exponential blowup when constructing the DFA (a[<some large character class>]{1000}a, for example.). A DFA-based regex also doesn&#x27;t handle a number of things.<p>As for slicing, I had a thought on that matter. Make slices reference the main array weakly, and have (weak) backreferences to any slices made of an array. When an array comes up for GC, if it has any slices made of it, copy out the slices to new arrays. There are a bunch of heuristics that can be tuned here, of course (don&#x27;t do weakref / backref at all on smaller arrays, don&#x27;t copy out slices if it won&#x27;t reduce memory usage, etc.), but it prevents the worst case at least.<p>The big advantage of slices is that it means that programmers don&#x27;t need to sacrifice readability for efficiency. It&#x27;s much easier to be able to pass in arr[7:10000] to a function than to either have to modify the function to take index parameters (which you can&#x27;t always do) or have to do a temporary copy. It also prevents the O(n^2) behavior associated with doing simple tokenizing (the change to Java&#x27;s substring behaviour, for example)<p>I disagree strongly with &quot;Encoding happens at program boundaries&quot;. The (major) problem with that is that there becomes no good way to pass strings through the language without going through an encoding pass. Try to implement cat in Python 3, for example. Encoding should happen when you ask for it.",1405997446

No, it wasn&#x27;t explicitly stated, but easily inferred that to the younger version of the author, the bicycle is a starship.<p>In reading the piece, I thought it would break the parallel construction by joining the present back to the past.

98574,comment,98227,98500,0,0,sridharvembu,,,"Granted. To be fair to Paul, I got about 60% of it based on a (rusty) idea of lisp. The _ got me (should've thought of Perl)... but now it is clear.<p>My broader point still holds though - there is a maximal density ...<p>And the reason I commented on it was that in posting that code fragment, the message was that it would be ""kind of obvious"" to any reasonably competent programmers how macros really help. I agree macros really do help, so no quarrel there.<p>In this case, we understand the ""application"" perfectly, and then we get to see the code. It still got (some of us) stumped, and (some of us again) actually know about macros and are moderately familiar with Lisp idioms. That is why I asked if density can go too far.<p>Compare that to something like LINQ, which I am coincidentally studying. It is a DSL for querying object collections (a similar use case to the code here). With no special background, you can go in, read code, and get a reasonable idea of what is going on.<p>LINQ actually lets you get rid of a lot of code (something I agree with in general), so it lives much higher on the density scale than a typical blub.",1200376517

Some of the people that stay longer at work, do it b/c to compesate for their inability to code fast.  They have to pull longer hours to keep up with their peers.<p>BTW, he is smart and some good money during the last tech boom.",1200375823

98565,comment,98528,98528,0,0,imsteve,,,"> find me a peer-reviewed study of individual programmer productivity among professionals not students<p>Often, five man development teams create products that are very successful while thousand man development teams create a product thats useless and basically has no value. Thus the five man teams were way more productive. This happens all the time.<p>Also, the same principal can be seen on an individual level within projects.<p>There ya go pal. It would be a waste to do a peer reviewed study just to confirm something so obvious. You could even say that they reviewers would be ""less productive"" if they spent their time doing so;)",1200373769

I remember reading that hard-drive post the day it came out and thinking, this is really going to please a lot of people - now they'll have something canonical to point to.",1200373583

98559,comment,98528,98528,0,0,gruseom,,,"He's right that almost all the discourse on this topic is anecdotal and that the literature basically sucks. It's surprisingly difficult to find hard evidence for the claims people make about software development. The only good, readable source I know is Robert Glass' <i>Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering</i>, which systematically cites research, most of which is surprisingly weak.",1200373275

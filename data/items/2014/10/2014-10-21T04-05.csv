Used to play videos games a whole ton.  Around the age of 15, I started having severe RSI-related pain in my hands.  Even after I stopped gaming, I could never get away from the keyboard and mouse, because I was a technology professional.<p>Fast forward 15 years.  I&#x27;d been dealing with constant pain every day for as long as I could remember.  My hands hurt even when I wasn&#x27;t typing.  It was bad enough that I was considering changing my line of work.<p>I&#x27;d tried every type of medical remedy under the sun.  I&#x27;d seen (many) doctors, physical therapists, chiropractors, acupuncturists, etc., but I couldn&#x27;t find any sort of treatment that provided anything but temporary pain relief.<p>Through some stroke of incredible luck, I stumbled across this article randomly while looking for something else.  I read it and found Aaron&#x27;s experience closely mirrored mine in a lot of ways.  I immediately bought the book he recommended, started reading it on my Kindle, and began following the advice contained within.<p>Two weeks later, I was almost entirely pain-free.  Now a year out, I can type all day without even the slightest twinge of pain.  Seem too good to be true?  I probably would&#x27;ve said the same thing if it hadn&#x27;t happened to me.<p>I will say one thing -- I&#x27;ve recommended this book to a number of people at this point, but not all of them have had the same kind of result I have.  I&#x27;ve noticed the ones who really buy into it and become convinced that their pain has a psychosomatic basis see their pain disappear.  The ones who still stick to the idea their pain is caused by an previous injury or old age -- those folks don&#x27;t seem to get much benefit.",1413866513

In a sense, their recent growth is just catching up to the long-term historical norm.<p>It is also different in that the US basically shipped them manufacturing capability (in some cases literally shipping the machines from Ohio).  I don&#x27;t think that has happened before at anything close to this scale.  This is the first industrialization period without a major destructive war at the end (so far...)<p>What happens if China shifts from a nation of producers to a nation of consumers like the US did in the 1950s? What happens if nuclear weapons or the example of the US keep their rulers from getting into costly wars? What happens if they control energy production in 25 years because they force all their producers to convert to solar early and dominate the industry.<p>Overall, I am skeptical that a historical study really generates much insight -- we are in uncharted territory.<p>Finally, I can&#x27;t read anything by Larry Summers without thinking about this article from Naked Capitalism.  <a href=""http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/07/why-larry-summers-should-not-be-permitted-to-run-anything-more-important-than-a-dog-pound.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/07/why-larry-summers-sho...</a>",1413866391

8485909,comment,8484718,8484718,0,0,dap,,,"Lots of great points here, but as always, these can be taken too far.  Header lines are really useful for human-readable output, and can be easily skipped with an optional flag.  (-H is common for this).<p>The &quot;portable output&quot; thing is especially subjective.  I buy that it probably makes sense for compilers to print full paths.  But it&#x27;s nice that tools like ls(1) and find(1) use paths in the same form you gave them on the command-line (i.e., absolute pathnames in output if given absolute paths, but relative pathnames if given relative paths).  For one, it means that when you provide instructions to someone (e.g., a command to run on a cloned git repo), and you want to include sample output, the output matches exactly what they&#x27;d see.  Similarly, it makes it easier to write test suites that check for expected stdout contents.  And if you want absolute paths in the output, you can specify the input that way.",1413866033

These were people who _occasionally_ had money. The remaining 300 million consisted of a largely poor underclass, a tiny &quot;middle class&quot; consisting of people with the buying power of less than the American minimum wage worker. Finally an &quot;elite&quot; class of workers who made more than an American burger flipper.

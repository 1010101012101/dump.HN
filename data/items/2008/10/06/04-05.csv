Many of them are geared toward the art of programming itself, rather than how to do X in Y days, which frees up the curriculum for exploring things like recursive forms that a student in a hurry would almost certainly just hack around, without learning the fundamental idea.<p>Also, learning Scheme as a first language almost guarantees you'll have to learn a second language. ;)",1223269179

Problems you'd want to avoid?<p>I don't care much for programming: I'm much more interested in design. As such, I really don't think I'll need to learn anything beyond PHP and Javascript. Are there things that I, and people like me, will run into because we don't know any better from other languages?",1223269142

In fact, every attempt I've seen is nothing short of laughable.<p>The problem with that concept is that it assumes we know exactly what it is that we like, and that it's easy to communicate that. Neither assumption is correct. As we learn, we constantly adjust what we like, at a fairly extreme rate, and it tends to be impossible to express in any way other than the extremely specific.",1223268753

There are a lot of questionable design decisions that will take a while to unlearn when PHP is your first language. The OO model is still a little screwed up, and uglier than C++ even, because of lack of namespace. There are arguments for and against it, I wont get religious. But if you want to be a ""programmer"" then you must move quickly from PHP. If you want to only be a web developer... fine. PHP is a baby step, even if you stick to dynamic languages.",1223268234

I had my expenses paid for, got to live with all my friends, yet still had lots of time to work on my startup.<p>The only thing I might suggest is that if you don't have a clear idea, you might want to consult for a while in the target industry.

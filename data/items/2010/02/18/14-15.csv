The claim is that you wouldn't want to run it because of stability, performance and battery life issues.<p>>  <i>In my opinion Apple do not like Flash and AIR because it is a major threat to revenue from App Store sales.</i><p>That's a common opinion, but I don't see how it holds up.  If you're talking about free Flash games the obvious competition would be free iPhone games which Apple makes no money off of.  If you're talking about ad-supported Flash games then the competition would be ad-supported iPhone games, which Apple makes no money off of.<p>> <i>The other aspect of Flash that worries Apple is obviously control. They have none over that content. So if someone wanted to produce a strip poker app with full nudity, for example, they could, and have it running full screen on an Apple device.</i><p>That's also reaching.  They have no control over any webapp you build either, and you could certainly pull off a strip poker game online without flash. You could even use real people.",1266505192

This is on the quite reasonable theory that if your machine doesn't have, e.g., the browser in memory then all the machine is doing for you is costing you seconds the next time you open the browser.  (This also reduces the necessity for makers of heavier applications to do various tricks to keep their apps in-memory themselves.  IE, Firefox, MS Office, and I think Open Office will all aggressively try to load themselves ASAP to decrease boot time.)<p>More broadly I think that ""zomg my memory usage is too high"" is one of those things that a) we should never, ever expose to non-developers because it tells them useless or harmful things and b) even many developers evaluate incorrectly.

But there are lots of edge cases. You can't make blanket statements and have them hold up. That's one of the reasons we have a juvenile court system -- to handle the mixed rights of parents and the children they live with. In general, however, the GP is more correct than not: children do not have rights in the same way an adult does.

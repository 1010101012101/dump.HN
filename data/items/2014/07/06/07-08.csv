Why are the seconds below minutes? It&#x27;s confusing. Why does the red bar representing stoppage time grow while the stoppage time itself shrinks (it&#x27;s a countdown)? Does not work well together imo. What do you display when the game lasts longer than stoppage time? -00:56? And why take the screen estate of seconds for stoppage time? They aren&#x27;t gone or anything. And I get the intention of &quot;cutting&quot; the clock in half for representing half times, but since the shape is primarily a clock I was wondering why the 30 minute mark is important. I&#x27;d cut the clock in quarters and use three of them to display the game&#x27;s progress (45 min - one half).<p>* How does this work on low-res TVs? They are still out there and need to be considered.<p>* Did they explain their icons? What&#x27;s e.g. the soccer field icon supposed to tell me?<p>As a whole it doesn&#x27;t seem to be thought through, sadly.",1404632080

For some reason it never occurred to me that ometajs and nodejs might be a great match until I read your (entirely client side) stuff ... I guess I just needed the right context to make the connection.<p>The more I think about it, the ability to create ones own language <i>and</i> execute on the server or on the client as one sees fit, seems like a really nice match. And all without having to do something &quot;heavy handed&quot; like clojurescript or other &quot;overt&quot; compile-to-js stuff...<p>Hm, and here I thought I&#x27;d given up on nodejs, and was ready to move on to other server side languages ;-)<p>Writing a custom markdown DSL that can live-preview in the editing client, and render to static html on the server for high volume, low-overhead hosting sounds kind of appealing... (There are of course many ways to do this, but the idea of a single, concise grammar and rendering engine is very appealing....).",1404630206

It let us do great things for so many years... it was a necesary step while there were no other LGPL libraries.<p>But we got rid of it, changed all our code to Qt, which run circles around GTK Never looked back, best decision we could ever make. It works beautifully in all platforms, it integrates OpenGL, pdf output, printers support.<p>The only problem about Qt is that not all open source programs use it, so you use Inkscape(GTK) in Mac and works so badly, you can&#x27;t even copy vectors(it copies pixel images instead!!).<p>GTK should die.",1404630191

7208837,comment,7208462,7208462,3,0,iandanforth,,,"This suggests there are land owners who are growing rich on the backs of the prosperous tech community.<p>I always find it strange that articles on this topic go directly from wages to rent prices without acknowledging there is a human making the decision to raise rent in between. It&#x27;s as if people have begun to believe that the relationship between demand and increased prices is a physical law rather than a societal tendency.<p>Consider the following alternatives. 1. A land owner decides not to raise the rent on their properties. (It might shock some to know that people do, willingly leave money on the table for all sorts of reasons) 2. Regulation fetters rent increases to prevent people from having to leave their homes.<p>I think there are many good examples where the above do not, and have not happened. But I take issue with the blindspot, or purposeful omission, of such discussion. Perhaps I am being overly harsh on readers of such articles, but I suspect that by omitting these considerations, you decrease the chance that one will call for property tax controls, rent caps, or organize local property owners into a self-regulating body to limit rent increases.",1392001083

Both involve a need to understand &quot;the rules&quot; that historical success imply, the need to collaborate in an improvisational way with co-workers in real time to please customers, and the need to master a complex set of skills to compete with others who are watching and learning from your performance as you start to succeed.<p>Here is a key graf from Wynton Marsalis &quot;The Humble Self&quot;<p><pre><code>   The first level of mastery occurs over self.

7208835,comment,7206637,7208193,4,0,saraid216,,,"> sprawl was a thing before cars as we know them came about. It&#x27;s a natural phenomenon to move away from the civic center<p>It is to a degree: it is a sign of status to be able to afford actual land from which you can bar others, and therefore actually using it isn&#x27;t terribly surprising. This has been true since before castles were invented. The main difference is that, in those times, it was understood that the occupants were aristocratic elite.<p>> we are just able to move father away because of cars. Before that, it was horses and carriages. Cars let us move further our, sure.<p>Right. The issue isn&#x27;t the combustible engine; it&#x27;s the attitude that comes with being a car driver, which isn&#x27;t that much different from being a horse rider. This is coupled with an illusion that you don&#x27;t lose the connection to the urban center as a consequence (indeed, in many places, you find that another urban center inexorably becomes necessary).<p>> Yes, it&#x27;s contributing to climate change, and we need to solve that problem, but I don&#x27;t think the solution is removing dependance on cars.<p>The problem that <i>I</i> want to solve is a fundamentally broken social structure incapable of doing things like opposing the NSA in a meaningful sense and the IDL is an exception rather than a rule. Cars contribute to this problem by weakening the social basis by which we commit civic action and by disenfranchising the core of our human populations (the percentage of human beings in urban centers broke 50% a long time ago) in order to service the more far-flung.<p>This is the essence of the city. Everything is connected. Our democracy is broken and <i>this is part of the reason</i>. People complain about how no one cares about the real issues. Why not? In part because they&#x27;re exhausted from their commute. Certainly there are other reasons, but this is one and it&#x27;s big.",1392001042

This is beyond stupid as ITER&#x27;s timeframe is known and is too little, to late. The project should be cancelled, as there&#x27;s only 2 outcomes : either it fails before the collapse. Or it doesn&#x27;t, in which case there&#x27;s zero chance of completion).<p>Alternatively we could prepare for failure. The only way to do that is to make sure we have 150 new nuclear power plants built all around the country in the next 10-15 years though. That should be Obama&#x27;s Manhattan project. Again, there&#x27;s two outcomes : either we find something better and it&#x27;s wasted money (that would be great !) or it saves our collective asses, and gives us another 100 years to come up with something better.<p>If the US army/govt does find a new energy source, it&#x27;s likely to be a nuclear one (the only real solution to our needs), and our energy problems are over until our grandchildren die.",1392000843

It&#x27;ll take me years to save up that kind of money, and when/if I do, I&#x27;m definitely gonna blow it on video games.&quot;<p>I learned a lot by writing a QBASIC script which added label functionality to DEBUG to make it more usable assembling large programs.<p>Also, the only C compiler I had was Turbo C++ Lite for DOS, which came with another textbook I picked up for cheap (I recall $20).  It was crippled:  You could only run programs from within the IDE.  If you used the &quot;compile to EXE&quot; option, it would work but the resulting executable would do nothing, just spitting out an error message along the lines of &quot;Only the full version of the compiler can produce working executables&quot;.<p>But because different programs produced different-sized executables, I figured that meant the EXE file wasn&#x27;t just a placeholder, it actually contained the compiled code but it was disabled somehow.<p>I figured out through tracing and in-memory patching (with DEBUG of course!) that there was a conditional branch within the first couple hundred instructions.

I have to agree. A quote from 7th link in a google search on flowery language:<p>> <i>Make clear statements in plain English. Attempts to sound “intellectual” usually result in the sort of vague, stilted, polysyllabic confusion shown in the first two ...</i>  [1]<p>Also, my experiences indicate that the typical hacker is a better expositor than most.<p>> <i>Learn to write your native language well. (A surprising number of hackers, including all the best ones I know of, are able writers.)</i>  [2]<p>The qualities that I personally look for in writing are clarity, conciseness, and impact.<p>The most important and least difficult is clarity. A lack of clarity might manifest as a reader&#x27;s overt confusion. But it can also manifest in more subtle ways such as: false equivocation; poor diction; surface analogies; digression; lack of examples; lack of structure; etc. Without clarity, the article is worthless.<p>After clarity, conciseness is next important. Synonyms might include &quot;efficiency&quot; and &quot;economy&quot;. Why say in 1,000 words what one can convey in 10? It&#x27;s not about shortness per se, but density of information; it shows respect for a reader&#x27;s time.<p>Impact is the least important and most difficult. Writing which has impact has an immediacy of experience. It makes for an easy and enjoyable read. The opposite is hiding behind a dense wall of flowery euphemisms.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=flowery+language&rlz=1C1GGGE_enUS466US466&oq=flowery+language&aqs=chrome..69i57&sourceid=chrome&espv=210&es_sm=93&ie=UTF-8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=flowery+language&rlz=1C1GGGE...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://wwwu.edu.uni-klu.ac.at/epirker/unix/hacker-howto.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wwwu.edu.uni-klu.ac.at/epirker/unix/hacker-howto.html</a>",1391999128

7208711,comment,7207348,7208316,1,0,einhverfr,,,"I am going to take a stab at this.  I would look at two things: the first is the fall of the Western Roman Empire, and the second is comparing Indonesia (as an American living in Indonesia) to the US.<p>When Rome fell, the result of the lack of central administration meant that the institution of Roman slavery began to evolve from proprietary rights over other people&#x27;s actions to proprietary rights over land entrusted to other people.  Over generations, the descendants of slaves became peasants with rights over the land they worked, with strong access to common resources.  Nutrition improved in the lower classes.  Laws were simplified.<p>Now this took some time.  You don&#x27;t see slavery turn into serfdom during the rein of Theodoric the Great, for example, but it&#x27;s a general trend in history that during most of the Middle Ages, when power was not well concentrated in the hands of the King (which was the norm until relatively late) that the poor did relatively well.<p>Another good comparison might be between Indonesia today and the US today.  Indonesia has a weak central government, with a very decentralized society.  The result is that society runs, at least in the cities, in almost an inverted order to what we think of in the US:  everyone but the obscenely wealthy live in gated communities, food production is widely distributed (and a substantial part of fruit and vegetable production happens in the cities).  As a result, the diet of those in poverty in Jakarta tends to be rice, tempe, and fresh produce (though access to unpolluted drinking water is a problem, I suppose right now, the US has issues there too at least in some states).<p>Families are stronger and they become the primary form of support, instead of the government.  This means that vertical transmission of wealth happens earlier in life (i.e. invest in your children&#x27;s businesses because that&#x27;s your retirement plan), and so forth.<p>On the whole, the elites in the US today use the power of the state to shape a culture where families are de-emphasized and undermined as a support structure, where we replace people with things as the necessary way out of poverty, and therefore where people are isolated from eachother in order to be made ready for the corporate workforce.<p>Corporations are creatures of the state.  It is unthinkable that corporations could totally dominate the economy if there is no large, powerful state backing them.  (BTW, one of the big issues with some strains of Libertarian thought is that if the government&#x27;s role is reduced to that of enforcing contracts, then it becomes reduced to backing powerful corporations.  What are the just limits of contracts cannot be purely found in the limit of a contract but has to be found from wider political controls.)",1391998972

Yes, Android phones primarily make up this group, but they are also represented strongly in the &quot;real smartphones&quot; category by particular models and vendors: Samsung Galaxy S4, etc. To think that Apple is ignoring this threat is laughable. They simply recognize that people buying free-on-contract smartphones who are basically indifferent to their advanced functionality are not their customer. Competing with those devices is not a priority. If you&#x27;re not a flagship phone from Samsung or LG (or a random few others), you aren&#x27;t competing with iPhone. This is just reality. Furthermore, as phone sales remain predominantly subsidized in the U.S. the price difference is immaterial to market share and allows Apple to enjoy its huge margins compared to most everyone else.<p>Apple has locked up profits in North America quite effectively and will no doubt focus on maintaining its share of the market, but further growth will have to happen in other markets. The question is, what does Apple have planned to address other markets? And what will the impact of new market segments be on this growth?<p>I can understand the merit of these questions as a stockholder. To me though the disappointing aspect is that having built one of the most efficient cash generating machines imaginable, Apple hasn&#x27;t seen fit to pursue a &quot;Big Idea&quot; that could only be realized with such an impressive cash hoard.

10300144,comment,10296319,10296935,0,0,pbhjpbhj,,,"My [cynical] view is that people in the BBC tend to work through a production company so they can profit from the BBC rather than the BBC producing the show as a public producer that merely pays wages. They can then lock up IP in their own company rather than being the BBC&#x27;s work-for-hire employees.<p>Shows like Gardeners Question Time (GQT) are stalwarts of BBC programming. The BBC could easily produce it, or commission it from a production company on the basis that it&#x27;s made direct in to the public domain [in copyright terms]. But that would presumably result in less money to the producers/talent.<p>There was scandal some time back that BBC were paying &quot;talent&quot; upwards of £1 million per series to do a single show a week. Thing is at the time the talent of course were also the owners of the production company for their show and so the BBC were paying their company some greater amount. The BBC promotion of such independent production companies makes them world ranking sellers whilst there seems no reason that such shows couldn&#x27;t be produced with only a name change and done under the BBC as producer.<p>Shows like Graham Norton aren&#x27;t exactly ground breaking, you get an ex-hospital radio presenter (or whoever) to chat inanely with people who are there to popularise their latest book; you get the interviews because who doesn&#x27;t want to advertise their film on primetime BBC, it&#x27;s not rocket science. Why can&#x27;t the BBC own a show like that? Why isn&#x27;t Mr Norton, or whoever, employed by the BBC and hired out if they&#x27;re in demand for other shows?<p>In short it all <i>seems</i> like a huge nepotistic mess of old-boy networks, and smoke and mirrors rather than a corporation that works for the people using their taxes and license fee money. As if the divisional managers in a corporation got together and said, hangabout we can make our divisions private enterprises and charge the parent company double to do what we do now??<p>But I&#x27;m probably completely mistaken ...",1443564638

A &quot;power&quot; pro might spend thousands of dollars per month, whereas the median pro is probably spending a few bucks a month.  How do you pick a subscription price that works for both of them?  IIRC, when we switched over from subscription to the pay-per-introduction model, something like 80% of pros could have used Thumbtack exactly the same as they did before and pay less.  It was just the huge power users would end up paying much more (though presumably still getting good ROI on their spending).<p>Second, when people had subscriptions fully paid for, they were incentivized to just respond to everything, even if they were not a good fit for the consumer.  Any chance of getting hired is better than no chance.  This is just a waste of time for both the pro and the consumer.<p>This process also played out over the course of years and wasn&#x27;t based on any master plan.  I created the subscription model when we were struggling to raise a Series A because the previous model wasn&#x27;t really working and we needed to start making money or the company was going to go out of business.  I had no idea if it was going to work or not, and when the first few people signed up it was incredibly exciting.

During the first week of my nightmare, the customer service team at Airbnb was - as I stated in my June 29 blog post – helpful, caring and supportive. In particular, one customer service manager - and the company’s freelance photographer - were wonderfully kind to me, and both should know how grateful I am.<p>> And since June 30? On this same day, I received a personal call from one of the co-founders of Airbnb. We had a lengthy conversation, in which he indicated having knowledge of the (previously mentioned) person who had been apprehended by the police, but that he could not discuss the details or these previous cases with me, as the investigation was ongoing. He then addressed his concerns about my blog post, and the potentially negative impact it could have on his company’s growth and current round of funding. During this call and in messages thereafter, he requested that I shut down the blog altogether or limit its access, and a few weeks later, suggested that I update the blog with a “twist&quot; of good news so as to “complete[s] the story”.<p>> Look, despite what some of you are saying, I am not an idiot. I understand why Airbnb called me and asked me to bring this story to an end; it is in their best profitable interest to do so. Unfortunately for me – 5 weeks and counting – there is no end in sight. Too much about this case remains unknown and unresolved, and according to both the District Attorneys and the police, it could be many more months before the criminal investigation moves forward.<p>> And for those who have so generously suggested a donation fund be set up to help me recover, I thank you from the bottom of my heart, and suggest that instead, you keep the money and use it to book yourself into a nice, safe hotel room the next time you travel.

I think that Elixir and Phoenix will very rapidly assume position #1 for web frameworks, surpassing Node.js and Golang among the cutting edge but practical crowd in the next 1-2 years, and surpassing Ruby and Python among the more conservative crowd in the next 3-4 years.  Java may be so entrenched in Entreprise systems that it will never be replaced, but if any ecosystem could do it, it&#x27;s Erlang/Elixir.<p>That said, if you want to work with one of these two languages in a job <i>now</i>, Scala is obviously a better bet.  But I could see that changing in as soon as 1 year from now.<p>Also, if you plan to mix a lot of computationally expensive stuff with concurrency, then Scala may be worth seriously entertaining regardless of the job situation or popularity, although for that, C/++ and ZeroMQ may be the best bet.  Based on my limited experience, and what I&#x27;ve read from expert Erlang users, hybrid C/Erlang projects tend to eliminate a lot of the concurrency benefits that pure Erlang systems have.<p>But I&#x27;ve been playing around more and more with Phoenix and other Elixir and Erlang projects over the past month, and am pretty amazed at what I&#x27;ve seen.  As much as I enjoy FP, I&#x27;m sad that I discounted Erlang for so long because of its lack of static typing (which is unfortunate, but far from being a deal breaker for me now that I&#x27;ve explored Erlang a little more).",1443564326

We&#x27;ll also have to disagree with each other due to different viewpoints, obviously.<p>I think that people being complacent or uncaring about what is going on without them is usually (but not <i>always</i>, its also possible I can be wrong too :) ) due to either being ignorant, misinformed, or not understanding the implications of an act.<p>If you do a highly dangerous activity in a town that hasn&#x27;t <i>killed anyone yet</i> but didn&#x27;t warn or tell the town that if something goes wrong - the entire town would be blown to smithereens. Of course, nobody would care. They either don&#x27;t know about the dangers (ignorance) - and the people doing the dangerous activity are actively giving misinformation about the actual dangers (misinformed), so anyone telling others about the dangers is just a &quot;paranoid tinfoil hat&quot; (not understanding the implications of the act).<p>Even if the town hasn&#x27;t blown up in 5 years - should they keep testing their luck until they blow up? Ignoring that it might be a calculated risk, people will only ever care when it all comes tumbling down and blows up in their faces. History has shown this time and time again. That&#x27;s an unfortunate aspect about society-at-large, but a lot of educated decisions and fail-safes can be put in place ahead of time. It merely relies on the public being educated. An ignorant public is an easily manipulated public.<p>As is oft-mentioned/quoted. Few people care about their online privacy... until you tell them their nudes can be seen by people other than their intended recipient. Then they suddenly care a lot [0]. Of course, that&#x27;s a little bit of a stretch in most cases. But as they educate themselves more and more about how important their privacy is (and how much they actually value it, by using examples) the more agreeable they become. It&#x27;s not an overnight process - it&#x27;s one that has to be won through many battles. Few wars have ever ended in a single battle.<p>There&#x27;s been larger and larger amounts of the public looking for and asking for more secure forms of communication. Or how to keep their communications private. That tells me that as more people are becoming educated, <i>more people are giving a damn</i>. That&#x27;s a sign to keep trying - not to give up because people don&#x27;t care.<p>People didn&#x27;t care that black people were slaves or that women couldn&#x27;t vote. There were even women who argued against women&#x27;s suffrage. It took many years - but eventually the general public was informed enough to change their minds about the importance of these things. Should they have given up when people told them they were wrong or weren&#x27;t making any public influence? I personally think it&#x27;s a good thing they argued for years on end instead of stopping 5 years in because of little to no progress. If it takes 10 more years to convince people their privacy matters, so be it.<p>I&#x27;m sorry for the length of my replies. I like to tread carefully with my viewpoints and make sure I mention exceptions as well as my willingness to entertain other viewpoints or at least show I understanding where they are arguing from, even if it comes down to &quot;I disagree with your reasoning&quot;.<p>TL;DR<p>I don&#x27;t think that the public-at-large not caring for their privacy <i>now</i> means they don&#x27;t care for their privacy. It means they&#x27;re ignorant or don&#x27;t understand the importance of their privacy. Education has shown that the public is changing and becoming more aware of the importance of their privacy. Adoption is slow, but even if it takes 10 more years to convince people privacy matters - that isn&#x27;t a reason to give up now.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_Udb8SYeS0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_Udb8SYeS0</a>",1443564248

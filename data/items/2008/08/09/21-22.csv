I want my up-arrow to work the way it does everywhere else, and I want to be able to cycle the interpreter process in less than a second. My .irbrc will load a per-directory .irbrc for me, so while I'm testing, CTR-D up-arrow enter will reset my test case for me.<p>Making Emacs does this was just too much of a pain.<p>As for hexl-mode --- have you ever <i>used</i> Hex Fiend? For that matter, have you ever used hexl-mode? I don't use hex editors only occasionally. I would pay money for a great hex editor. I would pay twice as much money never to have to use hexl-mode. Luckily, I don't have to do either; Hex Fiend is free. It is <i>awesome</i>. You can pull a 15 meg firmware image into it, and it won't even blink; you can search for a symbol table signature across that whole binary in sub-user time.<p>I'm not one of those people who wants their Emacs to do everything it can possibly do. I read my mail in Mail.app, and my news in NetNewsWire.<p>What do you get out of running your terminals in Emacs? I'm genuinely curious.",1218318805

The writer says he's on a GigE link --- presumably, he means ""on the same GigE as the target resolver"".<p>In the real world, attackers with that vantage point have better ways to hijack the DNS; for instance, they can usually reconfigure the target server.<p>Your LAN is way, way more owned than the Internet at-large is. Pretty much every network attack devised since 1992 still works on an internal network. The reason this doesn't kill you is, you don't let strangers on your internal network.",1218318706

271965,comment,271854,271854,0,0,DenisM,,,"The name of the game is expectation management. It's best to exceed the expectations than to fail them.<p>For example, Apple guides on 10 million iPhones sold this year. This is a laughably low number as it represents less than 70% YoY growth, well below typical 100% YoY in smratphone market. Add to that world-wide distribution which wasn't there last year and which is not a part of 100% trend. You can bet there will be headlines like ""Apple roars, sold double the iphones it expected"" in a year from now in every single news paper. And Steve jobs will be on stage saying ""well,iPhone was pretty popular this year. In fact, twice as much as we hoped - we can barely keep up production. Sorry about all the lines. ;)""",1218318099

271963,comment,271581,271753,0,0,simplegeek,,,"Well, other points still hold to some degree. Just consider the political instability most countries around India are going through right now. That is not a decent sight. India is still lucky in that lots of high profile companies have offices there but it's yet to happen in Pakistan. There are very few, if any. Microsoft has presence in Pakistan but it's mostly dealing with Government contracts and selling to Enterprise. No development offices of Yahoo, Microsoft, Google and alike. Overall, situation is more complex than one could imagine.",1218317812

Their API makes it very easy for sites to publish their data to the gnip service. They are pretty hardcore about ""hit us as much as you want"" to get data.

Pownce and Friendfeed are different to Twitter.<p>I think the idea of traction is very dangerous. It gives an excuse for losing competitors to sooth their fragile hearts. But if you believe market is efficient and ruthless and if you agree that users vote with their browsers in Web 2.0 world, then the failure of the competitors should be attributed more to failing to give what users want than the winner has more traction!<p>Case in point?

It is incorrect in most situations where it could be descriptive because the gentrification ""success stories"" did not happen in african-american neighborhoods. For example, Williamsburg, Brooklyn was an industrial area surrounded by Polish, Puerto Rican and Hasidic communities.<p>Also, the story doesn't work if you take into account the actual locations the article mentions.

It's just a major pain point which can actually be addressed with a technological, rather than a cultural, solution.<p>The root problem is probably extreme conservatism coupled with an unwillingness or inability to sensibly delegate responsibility, which adds up to systemic paralysis when it comes to actually getting things done.

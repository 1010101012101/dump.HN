(3) FREQUENCY of meals -- look up ""Stephan Curve"" or the unethical ""Vipeholm Study"" if you are interested in this...",1265590721

1108600,comment,1108392,1108392,0,0,verisimilitude,,,"I'm currently in the middle of dental school, and unfortunately this technology can't completely replace 500,000 rpm air turbine drills (a technology that is, to correct the article, NOT from the 1880s).<p>Here's the problem: bacteria (specifically, the acid they produce from metabolism of sugars) demineralize the hydroxylapatite of enamel (the stuff covering your teeth).  Enamel is not biologically viable and therefore does not have the ability to _regenerate_.  But it can, under certain circumstances, _remineralize_.  SO, eliminating harmful bacteria using plasma technology WOULD give portions of enamel the opportunity to remineralize.<p>Unfortunately, if a caries lesion (""cavity"") penetrates to the point that it reaches underlying, vital tooth structure (dentin, pulp), then surgical removal of the infected tooth tissue is the only way to effectively treat the growing lesion.  Bacterial control by plasma at this point would be insufficient to keep the structure of the tooth crown sound.  Thus, you need a drill to cut away tooth structure.<p>Furthermore, I object to the article's use of ""sterilize"".  It's important to understand that epithelial or mucosal surfaces covering the human body can never be sterilized (""all living organisms eliminated except prions"").  The bacterial load can only be reduced, never eliminated.<p>Then again... this article is a TechCrunch production, so what do we expect?",1265590269

I don't have much by way of suggestions for learning technical analysis.<p>I recommend basically reading books by:<p>Peter Lynch, Phil Fischer, and then chapters 8 and 20 of the Intelligent Investor. The book, Applied Value Investing, is also a pretty good place to start that actually does a lot of things well, combining both theory with practical case studies.
-Reading the Buffett Partnership letters (not the Berkshire letters) is very helpful for someone managing small sums of capital, say below $10M<p>In addition, you need to read and learn about financial accounting and valuation. John Tracy's How to Read a Financial Report is a good starter... for valuation Aswath Damodaran has a pretty good book that can be combined with McKinsey's book on the subject. Beyond that, some more advanced accounting books, especially forensic stuff is great to know. Financial Shenanigans and Creative Cash Flow Reporting are where I'd start with that.<p>To be really good you also need to read quite a bit about psychology/mental models. Look for speeches/lectures by Charlie Munger. Books like Stock Market Wizards/anything that contains a ton of interviews with investors are also great. Reminisces of a Stock Operator is pretty good for giving you an account of the ups and downs that come with investing -- the guy the book is based off of blew his brains out. Studying financial history is also a must, especially with learning about prior bubbles.<p>Finally, you just have to commit to reading a whole lot, every day, and becoming a learning machine.",1265589633

It is a very poor attempt at security through obscurity.<p>If the users system is compromised there is nothing you can do. Sacrificing general security for that case is silly.<p>The best defence to a keylogger attack is to have a secondary number vaidation alongside the password that requires you to enter a random subset of that number each time (eg 1st, 2nd, 8th).",1265587812

Key loggers on users' computers are probably their most common breach vector (by far), so whatever password policy minimizes that risk is probably best. You also see this in their other security policies - for example, asking a secondary password (security question) which sets a long-expiration cookie. With 128-bit SSL on the login page and a 5-guess lockout policy, there isn't much reason for strong passwords.",1265587400

I spent perhaps four or five years dentist-free.<p>My reward was a series of extremely painful toothaches followed almost immediately by a bunch of <i>very</i> expensive root canals and crowns.<p>Let me assure you: Once your toothache starts, your time as a dentist-denier <i>is going to come to a fast end</i>, one way or another. They hurt a <i>lot</i>. Not to mention the fact that if you get an abscessed tooth it can literally threaten your life.<p>Of course, you don't necessarily have to have the dental insurance and the well-paying job that I had when my dental emergency arrived. Instead you can elect the more traditional option: Have all the offending teeth pulled out. Then you may eventually need dentures. [1] I'm told that dentures are no fun whatsoever. I have had no reason to regret spending money on dentistry instead.<p>Of course, if you literally never touch soda or sugar, brush your teeth carefully, and are blessed with better genetics than mine you might get lucky...<p>---<p>[1] Pulling one tooth can have a negative effect on neighboring teeth, as the bone loss under the empty space causes the neighbors to loosen and slip.

9085152,comment,9080896,9085069,0,0,cousin_it,,,"Q: Is it true that the return value of any Haskell function depends only on its arguments?<p>A: Yes, barring tricks like unsafePerformIO. But you can write perfectly good programs that do IO without these tricks anyway.<p>Q: Okay, genius. What about functions like getLine, which reads a line from the console?<p>A: getLine isn&#x27;t a function.<p>Q: What?<p>A: All functions in Haskell have types like &quot;a -> b&quot; for some a and b. But you&#x27;ll notice that the type of getLine doesn&#x27;t have an arrow in it, it&#x27;s just &quot;IO String&quot;.<p>Q What do you mean, it&#x27;s not a function? I can call it right here, by doing &quot;do name <- getLine&quot;!<p>A: That&#x27;s not the syntax for calling functions in Haskell, that&#x27;s monadic do notation. The syntax for calling functions is &quot;foo x y&quot;.<p>Q: This is outrageous. So you&#x27;re saying that getLine is just an inert value?<p>A: Yes.<p>Q: But what is that value? What&#x27;s inside the type &quot;IO String&quot;? I&#x27;d always assumed that it was a kind of wrapper around a String, with some type system nastiness so people don&#x27;t misuse it.<p>A: No, I&#x27;m afraid it can&#x27;t be anything as simple as that. And it certainly can&#x27;t contain a String, because then getLine couldn&#x27;t be the same value all the time.<p>Q: Wait, you&#x27;re saying that it doesn&#x27;t even contain a String? Then what is it, really?<p>A: The implementation of IO types is kind of private to the runtime. But you can imagine that for any Haskell type X, &quot;IO X&quot; is a syntax tree of a side-effecting C program that produces an X.<p>Q: I see. So getLine really is the same value all the time. But how do you &quot;run&quot; the syntax tree that&#x27;s hidden inside getLine, to actually get a String?<p>A: You generally don&#x27;t. Instead you combine them together into one large tree and call it &quot;main&quot;, and the runtime takes it from there.<p>Q: That seems like a lot of work. At the very least, why doesn&#x27;t the language add some special syntax for combining syntax trees, so people don&#x27;t have to deal with plumbing?<p>A: Yeah, that&#x27;s what monadic do notation was invented for. Unfortunately, it was a bit too successful and some people started confusing it with actual imperative code :-)",1424511266

Particularly now that companies and employees are more resistant to the process of migrating elsewhere after the startup phase.<p>A startup&#x27;s office space is just one way that venture capital is getting funneled directly into a landlord&#x27;s pocket. And office rents are rising like crazy, while pushing lots of other types of businesses out (particularly in SOMA).<p>If a landlord thinks they can come out ahead by evicting a long time tenant and refurbishing a mechanic&#x27;s garage into office space, then you&#x27;re clearly paying a much higher rent than that space used to command.<p>Salaries are still a larger overall expense for just about every startup, but consider how much of that employee salary goes straight to rent. 30% in pre-tax dollars is completely normal at this point, and I expect for some people it&#x27;s even more. Ownership is out of the question for anyone who hasn&#x27;t had a stock windfall at a previous company (or who lived here 20 years ago). When a 1 bedroom in a shitty neighborhood is over $3000/mo, there&#x27;s a minimum to the salary you can accept -- even doing the normal salary-for-equity trade with a startup. Just to hit 30% of pre-tax dollars, you need to make $120,000/yr for that 1 bedroom.<p>There&#x27;s no reason for landlords to stop until they&#x27;ve milked the tech economy dry. In most cases they&#x27;re entirely within their rights to charge whatever the market will bear, and there is currently no shortage of people willing to pay more for less.<p>In the long term this will hurt San Francisco and the tech industry.

9085127,comment,9082666,9083417,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Netflix has already killed cable for a lot of users. Cable is an ancient UX where you rely on programmers to decide what to watch for you. That model was never good; it existed only because that&#x27;s all the technology supported when cable TV was developed. That model is now outmoded.<p>The only reason Netflix has yet to achieve utter dominance is the copyright cabal that no longer sees why it should entertain Netflix&#x27;s money-making when they can create Streaming Video Clone Site #2019 for their properties and collect all the money from subscriptions + ads themselves. Netflix eventually realized that their model was utterly fucked as long as copyright law stayed as it is (since their existence was dependent on the continued cooperation of third parties) and has been forced to rely on its own content to carry subscriptions, since everyone and their dog started making unrealistic demands and pulling their content, many to host on their own sites instead.<p>Consider that under current copyright law, almost the entirety of film history remains inaccessible without an explicit license grant from the rightsholder. If our terms were a little more reasonable, say anything pre-1980 was now public domain, Netflix may have had a chance to exist independent of Big Media&#x27;s permission. Under current conditions, Netflix can only stream content published prior to 1924 without permission (plus a smattering of mostly-unwanted films that lapsed into public domain due to registration errors or technicalities). Consider that in 1924, sound had not yet been added to film.<p>Cable television as we know it is doomed. People don&#x27;t like relying on programmers to decide what content they want to watch, they want to decide for themselves and get their content instantly. Netflix was one of the first services to offer this to the masses, but it can&#x27;t reap the rewards because of the oppressive state of copyright law.<p>Once Netflix really breaks away from dependence on Big Media&#x27;s copyright grants, they may become one of the biggest champions for modernizing our IP laws to reflect the realities of the digital age.",1424510180

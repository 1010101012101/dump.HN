This is not solving the problem, only hand-waving it elsewhere.<p>The potential use of a container-initiated networking event (socket open) to trigger responses at the infrastructure-level is the key architectural novelty here. This is essentially a suggestion for &#x27;implicit infrastructure&#x27; as opposed to &#x27;explicit infrastructure&#x27;; with all of the benefits and drawbacks you would expect from such a paradigm shift.<p>Personally I believe that the implicit paradigm is mostly useful in specific, relatively controlled use cases, such as service testing or behavioral profiling prior to live deployment.<p>More thoughts on the same: <a href=""http://stani.sh/walter/pfcts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stani.sh/walter/pfcts</a>",1411426506

By Apple forcing the government to serve the warrant on the accused, most importantly I think we put the conversation where it belongs; not on the 4th but the 5th.<p>Does the 5th actually protect the accused in your particular example? I think it does, and I&#x27;m glad it does, because I think a 5th amendment which failed to protect the accused from this sort of self-incrimination, would fail overall.<p>How much can a defendant be forced to aid in their own prosecution? You cannot ask them &quot;did you do it&quot; and use their refusal to answer as evidence against them.<p>Now I have a device which constantly records the audio, video, GPS, temperature, barometric pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, etc. Maybe in a few years time it records not just everything it hears and sees, but literally everything <i>its owner hears and sees</i>. These devices have become, and will increasingly become, true and pure extensions of our own consciousness.<p>Today you have two choices; you can leave it all open and available for the government to &quot;collect&quot; and use against you, or you can quite literally keep it locked in your head using encryption.<p>The Bill of Rights was written in 1789.

Being black in tech can be very isolating, and being an entrepreneur can be much much worse, I know because I&#x27;ve been there.<p>I&#x27;ve know the feeling of going to conferences and having to be super friendly and way more jovial than you feel is normal just to get conversations going, all the while feeling like a phony inside. I know how it is to have coworkers stop inviting you to lunch after a while not realizing, that from the outside you&#x27;ve been excluded from a &#x27;clique&#x27;. I know the feeling of people either thinking you&#x27;re not friendly and avoiding you, or that you don&#x27;t know shit and avoiding you, or worse being patronizing to you.<p>I remember trying to be friendly with everyone and having people kinda just ... ignore me. It hurts and can make you retract into a shell. At work, that makes things worse, because then you get tagged as &quot;not a team player&quot;<p>It can really really suck, but what you have to do is not let that beat you and make a strong effort to go and find people that you can get along with and cleave closely to them.

They&#x27;ll probably share the same frustrations and fears as you and they&#x27;ll look out for you.<p>So pick your head up and go back out there and do it all over again, don&#x27;t stop doing what you&#x27;re doing, but instead of spreading yourself thin trying to befriend everyone, think of yourself as an acquired tast. Be more selective with the people you approach, try to build the deep friendships that will first help you not feel isolated. then from there you can go on to just be yourself, and everything should just work out.<p>cheers",1411426022

Bitcoins are a digital medium of exchange that can be traded on online exchanges for a dollar value. Bitcoins are &quot;mined&quot; through the use of computer resources to solve complex algorithms. Many times, consumers&#x27; computer resources are unknowingly accessed by entities through software code or otherwise in order to mine for Bitcoins.<p>Plaintiff&#x27;s own description of its services strongly suggests that the code it developed is, in fact, designed to hijack consumer&#x27;s computers. ....

Furthermore, the Division determined that the code was active.<p>The following representations, among other things, are made on the Tidbit Website: &quot;Monetize without ads&quot;; &quot;Let your visitors help you mine for Bitcoins;&quot; and &quot;Built on the bleeding edge.&quot; The Tidbit Website further provides: &quot;How does it work? ...

Very clearly sales people who are used to dealing with business customers who probably won&#x27;t have anything to do with the actual product in the day-to-day.<p>I was given vague salesy answers that clearly intended to skirt around the issues I presented, and they had no issue trying to exert pressure come monthly/quarterly sales quotas.  Exploding offers for a large purchase of this nature are simply not appropriate (and certainly not appreciated).<p>Perhaps my biggest gripe has been with the lack of transparent pricing for any sort of B2B SaaS where you are on the highest tiers, and thus need &quot;custom pricing.&quot;  I understand some things are variable and need to be custom scoped, but in this case that was only true for some add-on services vs. the core product with volume-based pricing.  As a prospective customer, I absolutely loathe these sorts of pricing negotiations.  The time wasted on the back-and-forth is also a giant PITA and doesn&#x27;t win the companies any points.  It is always very obvious that their initial price is a high-ball offer, and they expect you to negotiate, which means that they in part are structured/incentivized to make some margin/sales commission by not giving the customer the fairest price they could.  This in and of itself starts the relationship off on the wrong foot.<p>In general, I wish there was a way to choose the type of sales experience I want before beginning the process.  If I&#x27;m a key decision maker and care more about the actual functionality, UI, integration, etc., I want someone knowledgeable of the technical aspects of the product.  Someone who will be upfront on the product&#x27;s shortcomings (to avoid surprises that result in a pissed-off customer down the road and make the buyer look like an idiot). I also want someone who can communicate with zero sales fluff, and give me fair and transparent pricing.  Is that really too much to ask?  Apparently so when it comes to enterprise B2B sales.  Over the years I&#x27;ve often had the distinct impression that many of the salespeople I&#x27;ve dealt with exist simply to funnel communication between a sales engineer.  I get their value if they are out hunting and bringing in their own prospects, but these have all been for inbound leads where I&#x27;ve contacted them.<p>Also, do all those fluffy buzzword-filled sell sheets and cheesy marketing videos devoid of any meaningful, tangible content actually add value for anyone?  I had one sales guy send over an (often unrelated) white paper or marketing video link with every. single. email.  I ultimately had to tell him to stop because it wasn&#x27;t adding any value and was doing more harm than good.<p>Guess this turned into more of a rant...but if anyone has good solutions for dealing with the above I&#x27;m all ears.  I&#x27;ve negotiated these kinds of contracts for years, know how the game is played, and play it reasonably well (IMHO).  Doesn&#x27;t make it any less frustrating.",1411425125

However, for what it&#x27;s worth, I (and a group of people in a local UC group) found the low FODMAP diet correlated well (which is more recently researched than the SCD, and a little easier to manage).  Unfortunately for me, my illness also overcame the strengths of the diet.<p>Here&#x27;s the &quot;one weird trick&quot; part though.  There&#x27;s a documented negative correlation between appendectomies and occurrence of UC/Crohn&#x27;s.  There&#x27;s early, but growing evidence that an appendectomy may work as a treatment for some types of UC (at least in the young).  After my last flare, we tried an appendectomy -- the alternatives were a lifetime of Infliximab (which is expensive for our public health system), or a full colectomy (which, in all honesty, I was leaning towards anyway).  It worked, and I&#x27;m now in full remission.  I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;ll be lasting, but my related eye conditions (which persisted during a limited round of treatment with Infliximab during an earlier flare) have vanished too.

For example, different objects and methods of description are frequently represented using the same classifier handshapes, despite how varied their placement and combination can be.<p>On a similar note, the linguistic meaning of &quot;word&quot; is much, much fuzzier than native English speakers expect (letters surrounded by spaces). Trying to pin a particular level of structures across language categories becomes very difficult due to morphemic, phonetic, and syntactic processes that can break down word boundaries. (Even consider contractions in English for that matter. What makes <i>don&#x27;t</i> one word when <i>do not</i> is two?)

8352959,comment,8347636,8349861,1,0,SoftwareMaven,,,"I would bet most researchers have good intentions. However, it is very difficult to see things that your own salary requires you not to see. If your paycheck depends on researching how drugs impact diabetes, it doesn&#x27;t matter how much you believe in diet as a method of control, your research will reflect drugs. When the USDA bought into the low fat dogma in the early 80s, suddenly all research dollars went to people who would perform studies showing how bad fat was. People who disagreed were black-balled.<p>On the topic of other countries, it is interesting. France has largely kept its traditional diet (which is incredibly high in saturated fat), but almost all of the English speaking world has followed the US into a high-sugar, low-fat, grain-based, heart-unhealthy diet, whether grain is a primary agricultural product of that country or not.<p>In the end, I don&#x27;t think it is all about money. Some of it is pure obtuseness. A recent 125 page report detailed the effects of salt consumption on health risk. It showed a significant increase in risk as salt consumption dropped below 2300mg/day. The Institute of Medicine has changed its recommendation as a result, but the AHA has decided 1500mg is still the right target for everybody. This is not a result of a financial agreement; instead, it seems to be more a result of an unwillingness to admit they were wrong. That&#x27;s a powerful pull, because once there is a crack in the exterior, the whole wall may crumble.<p>In the end, I could be wrong. I&#x27;m making deductions based on appearances and behaviors coupled with the massive funds (millions and millions of dollars) being funneled into these organizations. I&#x27;m sure the researchers sitting in the labs are doing the best they can within a set of constraints dictated by the funding organizations.<p>On the diabetesjournals.org article, my comment would be two-fold:<p>First, observational studies are shit. You cannot make conclusions from them the vast majority of the time. It was smoking that brought those studies into vogue, where <i>relative</i> risks were in the range of 2000% to 10000% (compare that to 25% in diet studies) and <i>absolute</i> risks were in 20-40% (compare that to maybe 1.5% in a &quot;highly successful&quot; diet study).<p>Second, I&#x27;ll leave this[1] reference. Dr. Richarch Feinman came to nutrition after teaching biochemistry in medical school. The biochemistry was so abundantly clear that he was shocked when he found out the orthodox position in nutrition is almost diametrically opposed to the biochemistry. Diabetes is a disease of carbohydrate intolerance, recommending 6-11 servings of carbohydrates a day is silly.<p>Now, what is missing is the causal link between over-consumption of carbohydrates and diabetes. My own hypothesis is that there are a few components: a genetic component that defines maximum tolerance and a dietary component influenced by certain foods that tend to put the body into an inflammatory state.<p>If one is healthy, I think one can eat just about any real food diet and remain healthy, whether paleo, low carb, Mediterranean or ovo-lacto vegetarian (vegan <i>requires</i> supplementation, so I can&#x27;t include it in the list). If, on the other hand, one has a damaged body from eating too many not-quite-food products, the equation shifts and looks much more like what treating Type 2 diabetes looks like.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.nutritionjrnl.com/article/S0899-9007(14)00332-3/fulltext"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nutritionjrnl.com/article/S0899-9007(14)00332-3/f...</a>",1411423880

On the other hand, the H-H model tries to deal with the physical reality of the human brain so it is much more complicated and relies on some data (like axon width) that simply doesn&#x27;t exist here.<p>It would be possible and potentially interesting, for sure, but probably more work than you might think.",1411423539

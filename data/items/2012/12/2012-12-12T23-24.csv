However you should funnel that misery into motivation into building your app. If you are single, don't have kids you can do this easily, nights and weekends. It will mean giving up some hobbies and not going out with friends but I like your odds. The money you saved should not be spent on living without a job for 6 months, pay someone to help you build your idea. The risk is low as it seems unlikely you would move in with your parents if you had a wife and kids. The flipside of this is;<p>You build your business, you finish it and then... maybe you don't have any customers, or no revenue, and the panic of ""I have no job and my product is failing"", this is a pretty terrible and terrifying feeling.<p>For the record I've met 2 people who opted for what you are proposing (quit job, work on project full time) and they both went through the panic of ""my project is done and I have no or insufficient income!"" And what happens if you don't finish? What happens if you hit a snag? Even if you do everything right does not mean you will have enough paying customers after 6 months. I feel like you are setting yourself up for failure without a net. I know it works out for some people, but I'm only playing the percentages here and I feel like you are more likely to be on the losing end.<p>I on the other hand have a wife, 2 kids, am the primary bread winner and have built my project after hours. It has been slow going and I have no revenue. I've lost a lot of sleep. I've struggled with marketing. However I still have confidence in what I'm doing, and while it takes more time for me to make changes and market on my own I prefer being where I am. My only complaint is I can't market much from 9-5. I've resorted to making cold calls at lunch, but I feel like I'm doing the right thing (I don't have much of a choice really with the kids and family, but still). My project may be a total failure but I still have the satisfaction of building something myself without the panic. All I lost was sleep, and time with friends. I have no regrets.<p>For me there will be no dread fueled panic (or panic fueled dread) from the feeling of ""I have a project that is not generating enough revenue and I have no job!"" Granted I can't afford to quit. But while I've made some unwise decisions in development(learning a new language/framework to build a web app) and struggled with some decisions I don't feel the pressure that those bad decisions ruined me, they were learning experiences. Please do not quit your job.<p>If I can do it after hours you surely can do it. Listing to Rob and Mike from Startups for the Rest of Us podcast, and they both worked on their startup until they had enough revenue to quit. I would trust their advice before mine. Definitely pay someone else to help you, which will move things along faster. You are young and the risks are low, it's a worth while investment.<p>Good luck man, sorry to come out on the same side as your parents.",1355356653

Or do you think that it's mostly people who are unwilling or don't have the education background to do work with utility? I feel like a lot of minimum wage is a big negative feedback loop - if you are making $7 an hour, you have to work a lot of hours to put food on the table. And these are generally manual jobs, or at least involve a lot of standing, and so you are exhausted by the end of the day. Plus - with poverty being so endemic, chances are nobody around you has an education either, so you can't see first hand that education really gets you anything. And, with a lack of money, you either have no credit or (more likely) bad credit. So how do you get out of that trap?<p>When your parents are struggling to make ends meet like this, what do you do as a kid? You start working night shifts in high school instead of studying for the SATs.<p>If you took people in this trap who were willing, and subsidized them for two years to go to community college, I feel like you'd have a huge increase in productivity, especially across generations. And it wouldn't even be that expensive, especially if you factored in increased tax revenue. Or heck, as a lesser goal, make it a goal to enable people making under $X/hour to get their GED.<p>Maybe this is way too idealistic.<p>I was lucky.

I mean, it seems to me that looking at it objectively, the future is very self-evident.  What product did publishers provide?  Among other things, their business model was completely built upon distribution being a valuable service and the entire industry being impossible without it.  This made them rich.  Now, distribution is a worthless service.  In fact, the way in which they provided distribution for so many years, they are actually actively destroying value by having to adhere to all of the arcane, unnecessary geographic limitations that made distribution possible a decade or so ago.<p>Now, they will either morph and stop even charging for distribution (since any 12 year old with an Internet connection could beat their ass at the task) and radically shink their business (from billions to thousands) as they have lost their golden goose, or they close their doors.  They can still make money providing a few services like aggregation (when distribution is essentially free, aggregation becomes a valuable service... not as valuable as distribution used to be, but not worthless either).  They can provide promotional services to their writers (who are now the bosses, while the publishers are starving service providers) and things like that too.<p>If they're really smart, they will realize that the future is consumers getting their journalism from, gasp, journalists directly since distribution is now basically free.  How can they profit from that?  Well, finding journalists, managing logistics for journalists, etc could be valuable services.  There is no question, they have to face the fact that there will no longer be The Fifth Estate and they will no longer be international power brokers, they won't even be reasonably wealthy businessmen.  They're going to be working from home and shuffling bits unless they're willing to get on a plane and go where the danger is and become a journalist themselves.  I understand from their perspective this is a scary prospect, the same for anyone who feels that the status quo gives them safety and predictability.

Sometimes out of desire or necessity you need to do something async, and then you will always have to have some sort of typical callback/async style code...but what you can do with this is control where that code lives and express it in different ways.<p>In your example, have startServer start a server, then on each request create a generator, keeping a list of the active ones.<p>Your request handler would typically be written like this:<p><pre><code>  function requestHandler (client, request) {
      sendToDatabase(request, function(data){
          client.sendReply(data);
      });
  }
 </code></pre>
What this allows you to do is write something like this:<p><pre><code>  function requestHandler (client, request) {
      data = yield sendToDatabase(request, client);
      client.sendReply(data);
  }
</code></pre>
Where the callback has been moved to the sendToDataBase function. It would be something like this:<p><pre><code>  function sendToDatabase(request, client){
      myDBLibrary.query(request, function(data) {

U-238 turns into Plutonium and some of that fissions but some is turned into heavier long lived transuranics. U-235 is very rare so we can't run just on that: this is what is enriched with centrifuges (no chemical separation possible as it's chemically similar to U-238) and what people mean when they say we will run out of uranium. Most of spent nuclear fuel is still just U-238. Maybe one could simplify and say that the spent fuel is not ""used up"" : instead it is ""poisoned"".<p>2. Thorium reactors have Th-232 and U-233. Simplified, the Th-232 turns into U-233 when it absorbs a neutron. U-233 fissions very well and releases more than two neutrons when it captures a neutron. There's quite many steps up to transuranics from that where fission can still happen, so you get very little transuranics.<p>3. There is the ""breeder reactor"" that would use just U-238 by making plutonium out of that. But you need fast spectrum and it's hard to control. It would have plenty of fuel though since there's lots of U-238.<p>4. What's more significant is that since U-233 is so good, you only need very little. AND you can use thermal spectrum making control easy.<p>The thorium system is very clever in so many ways but it only works well if you design the whole reactor concept understanding what you have - neutronics and chemistry.<p>It's not very complex at all, just read up on it, the basics can be understood in a couple of hours.<p>Then you understand why it produces less waste, consumes less fuel, why putting thorium rods to solid fuel reactors doesn't make sense (protactinium) etc etc...",1355354857

4913063,comment,4911190,4912232,5,0,eropple,,,"-As mentioned in the sibling comment, stability is a problem.<p>-Refactoring support isn't great. It's about on par with stock Visual Studio, but stock Visual Studio isn't good compared to VS+R# or IntelliJ. If you're writing ""just"" an iOS application, I can see this not being a huge deal, but my own use case is bringing over projects for OS X and iOS where I tend to have a lot of code and I'm very used to being able to do massive, contextual refactorings when needed. Can't do that in MonoDevelop.<p>-It's GTK#, so you have to accept that some stuff just doesn't feel native on a Mac. My mental map of keyboard behaviors no longer properly applies and it's jarring going between it and XCode or IDEA. It's gotten a lot better since I started using it on a Mac, to be sure, but it's not there yet. I compare it here to IDEA, which is also not Mac-native, but manages to feel a lot closer.<p>Now, one huge, huge plus, that I have to give them a ton of credit for: <i>unlike</i> Visual Studio, MonoDevelop is non-destructive toward project files. This is a power-user beef but a really important one once you get there; if you've hand-edited a csproj, Visual Studio will happily destroy all of your changes (it loads the csproj into an in-memory object model and writes it back out on save). This is infuriating when you have custom stuff in it - something as simple as a wildcard path in a file reference (which is totally fine as per MSBuild rules) will be mashed into a static list of all files at time of invocation. It is super bad, and if MonoDevelop improves some more I might switch to it, even on Windows, solely because of that lack of misfeature.",1355354263

I'm on an iPhone, though).<p>I also recently ran into him at Science Hack Day last year, and I was <i>floored</i> at how well he was interacting with the kids there, teaching them enough JavaScript and Unity3D to make a ""game"" (actually, just a model and some floating platforms that you could move through; I don't even think you could land on the platforms: no collision detection).<p>I thereby highly question the validity of a malfeasance claim against him.

4913002,comment,4910406,4912665,1,0,tossacct,,,"Part of the text of your citation is available on google books.  It seems like an academic memoir to me - lots of personal accounts, some quotes from period books on cheating, little else.  Certainly not scientific.  Here's a quote:<p>>>>Certainly not all - and probably not most - college students cheated and plagiarized.<p>It has neither data nor studies.  It is Sue Carter Simmons' professional opinion.<p>That said, I agree with you that modern kids don't necessarily cheat more than non-modern kids do.  I agree that parts of theologic's comment were directed at ""modern kids"" and the teachers of these modern kids.  I can see how a reasonable person (you, stdbrouw) could <i>infer</i> that theologic was saying that modern kids have different cheating habits than non-modern kids.  I submit that there is another reasonable person (myself) that does not <i>infer</i> that theologic was saying that modern kids have different cheating habits than non-modern kids.  Let me explain:<p>>>> The best way to slow cheating is to not give an opportunity to cheat in the first place<p>This is the last line of theologic's comment.  The proposed ""best way to slow cheating"" works equally well for modern and non-modern kids, it does not target either group.<p>The other references to modern kids inherently do not explicitly say anything about non-modern kids.  There is no comparison or contrast, which leaves room for you and I to make our opposing inferences.<p>To be fair, if theologic had said something explicit about non-modern kids, I would tend to agree with your inference.",1355353668

In other words, the standard textbook picture of how supply and demand work need not apply to labor.<p>When that happens, the market for labor may never clear despite falling wages.

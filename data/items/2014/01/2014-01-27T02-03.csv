I have no problems with the ones who are good at their jobs, but about half are below average, working on commission, and their tactics are the same as spammers (spread yourself indiscriminately far and wide).  Many are downright scammers such as taking resumes off the net and then pretending to represent those people, or scraping job postings off websites and then pretending to represent those companies.<p>At the top of my resume I put a &quot;note to recruiters&quot; that makes it clear what I am good for.  It is very clear then which recruiters have made even that miniscule effort, versus just started spamming right away.<p>I&#x27;d say I see about one good recruiter for every 20 spammers.

Basically, kind of an retargeting strategy but applied to hiring. I understand why this may be annoying to you, but your case is probably rare enough that they decided to go along with it -- I would think that most people do not care enough about being contacted by companies they do not want to work for to complain. I do not condone this but the assumption that you may not feel as adamant about not working at Google as you did two years ago (during which a lot can happen) seems perfectly understable to me.<p>With that said, your post does come across as really obnoxious. Asking to have an &quot;ON PAIN OF DEATH&quot; mention added on their file? Really? I dislike having my instructions disobeyed as much as the next guy, but if I counted properly this is <i>6 emails over more than 7 years</i>. Surely one could live with receiving one unwanted email every year or so? It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s that hard or time consuming to just ignore a message or to decline politely -- after all, a lot of people do it multiple times on a daily basis, and I&#x27;m sure you do too.<p>This is too bad, because the tone of your post distracts from the perfectly valid (but IMHO, minor) point that this policy  does imply things about Google they view themselves.",1390789965

If all the people communicate simultaneously online, and there&#x27;s no leader, and they reach a consensus that they&#x27;re going to convince the military and police not to stop them (beginning with persuading servicemen in their own families), then nobody stops them on the day they revolt.  So the real struggle happens in the weeks and months before the revolution in the hearts and minds of the institutions that prop up those in power.  If the revolutionaries find themselves throwing rocks at police on revolt day, then they&#x27;ve probably already lost.  Unfortunately we only hear one side of this on mainstream news, specifically to keep us demoralized and in the dark about how nonviolent revolution works.<p>Of course in the western world, we&#x27;re all democracies already, so we may never have a revolution like this.  I guess I&#x27;m most concerned about voiceless democracy, where as you said capital trumps humanity, and they subvert us all into working toward their goals instead of ours.  I really worry about people being perceived as a &quot;cost&quot; on society, because it frames any argument for the social welfare in a bad light in people&#x27;s minds.

The more financially successful I get, the more perspective I get and see these complexes feed off of what can be many times ruinously-expensive pursuits by middle class families to hew to normative expectations if they live anywhere near the top-10 metro areas in the US, maybe even the top-20.<p>The &quot;disruption&quot; we&#x27;re talking about at HN has currently mostly served capital interests and concentration of power/wealth. Even the example you cite of fractional stock ownership plays into that concentrating trend (most poor to middle class families simply do not have the financial stability and acumen to weather what are to them volatile equities or even indexes, which plays into the pockets of better-capitalized participants). I suspect we&#x27;ll see some unexpected socioeconomic reactions from families in response to these pressures, and disruptions if any will organically arise from these demographics&#x27; reactions. One possible unintended consequence for example, might be the rise of line/group marriage, poly and extended families simply from the economic pressure of shouldering the massive debt burdens being placed upon families, with simultaneous wage depression and and inflationary pressures on goods and services this demographic primarily uses (current inflation measures only serve the interests of the capital class; good for me, but steadily disastrous over the long haul for poor and middle class families).<p>The heteronormative nuclear family with the original two biological parents is already a minority within the US, less than 25% as of 2000. But consider the vast waste that the household formation of a nuclear family entails: expensive capital is tied up into &quot;white goods&quot; that are used a fraction of the time throughout the week, just for starters. When due to combined wage and debt pressure people start organically forming non-traditional households (the nucleus of which has already started: the vast majority of households are non-traditional though as yet very small-scale) out of necessity and self-preservation, major industries would be impacted (both positively and negatively).<p>Now imagine just the political repercussions if this came to pass: if the &quot;Moral Majority&quot; is blowing a gasket over gay marriage now, what invective would we see when gays are included into group marriages and helping raise children in that context? Into this cauldron of change is where we will find the next disruptive moves.<p>I don&#x27;t know what form the change is going to come from (I have some guesses), but I suspect something interesting will arise from the pressures our civilization is exerting upon these demographics.",1390789051

With my mac I screenshot a slide from an anatomy atlas to the clipboard. Then use the image occlusion editor to hide labels on the slide, and then I use the editor to highlight a certain area on the slide and ask &quot;what is this muscle?&quot; 70% of my cards require copy/paste of images. Without this feature I could never switch.<p>2) Cloud storage that synchronizes flashcards on my mac and mobile device. I do a lot of flashcard review in the gym, bathroom, waiting in line, etc. Without mobile I could not switch.<p>3) Searchable index of cards. I make a flashcard for every major piece of information that I need to know for school, and I use search to connect that information. For instance we spent the last 6 weeks learning about metabolic pathways and what factors regulate enzymes within them, but we never focused on specific regulators. With Anki, however, I can search for a certain activation enzyme, say protein kinase A, and then have a deck of flashcards showing me what pathways are affected by said enzyme.<p>Those are the biggest must have features for me that set Anki apart.

If you are worried about, eg, the ability of the poor to afford food, and have a simultaneous goal of promoting domestic industry, the optimal policy is income subsidies + the tariff you would have imposed anyway.<p>In fact, you can use the tariff to finance the income subsidies, and it will work at some tariff level as long as the right proportion of the market for that good is not receiving the subsidies.<p>Further, the industry growth prompted by the tariff is likely to disproportionately help those the income subsidy would be targeting.

I&#x27;ll take a swing at it.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with 2 strokes, 4 strokes (including Miller Cycle versions), and rotaries.<p>The two strokes hit a wall pretty quickly. They are very rev-happy, but their combustion leaves a lot to be desired. Most lack conventional valves and rely on ports to move the mixture around. You can supercharge them, but I&#x27;ve never been able to do so properly. Once the engine size starts to increase, their main advantage (RPM capabilities) start to diminish. Plus their combustion is not very clean, due to the lubrication being part of the fuel. They are fun when modified, but noisy. Ask my neighbor (who gets to enjoy the glorious sound of the modified 2 stroke in my weed whacker).<p>The 4 strokes suffer from harmonics, weight, and packaging issues. But they can be supercharged without much problems. You can get at least 100 HP/Liter on a 4 stroke engine without much issue (when you build it properly, of course). Building a 1,000 HP 5 liter engine can be done by buying off the shelf parts. The problem is that when harmonics start dancing to the devils fiddle, your valves start to drop, and your pistons shatter like the dreams of those who bought ENRON stock.<p>The rotary is my favorite racing engine. It doesn&#x27;t drop valves (it lacks them). You can scale them by bolting on <i>more rotors</i> (12 rotor beast here: <a href=""http://i436.photobucket.com/albums/qq83/Adam-Blackshaw/12rotor2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i436.photobucket.com/albums/qq83/Adam-Blackshaw/12rot...</a>). They rev like crazy and feature few moving parts. But they are hard to tune properly, and tend to run a bit hot if not maintained correctly. Mazda built, raced, and won Lemans in 1991 with a 4-rotor equipped car called the 787B. Which sort of proves that they are viable engines. The real problem is emissions. The rotary has not received as much R&D as the 4-stroke, and thus it is a bit behind. Further developments by Mazda have improved it, but I don&#x27;t see it lasting too much with the future CAFE standards looming over the horizon. It is also not very fuel efficient, due to it using ports rather than valves. Though I&#x27;m curious as to how a direct injected rotary might improve all of these issues. Not sure if I will ever see it happen.<p>Before you call me biased towards the rotary, let me tell you that I do not, or have ever owned one. I have worked with them, and got to enjoy it very much. My current favorite engine is the Porsche flat 6, because the damn things will take any boost you send their way.",1390788004

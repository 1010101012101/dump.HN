He says that to compete with the iPhone, Verizon has ""18 multimedia phones"" with picture and messaging packages. <p>But when you go to a Verizon store, and use the phones, they're all hideous attempts to create cool devices. Why do they even need EIGHTEEN devices? The menu systems are ugly and practically unusable, the buttons on the phones are poorly designed-- I bought my dad a Razr K1m, and the buttons are so small and flat that you have to grow your finger nail to press each individual number. The Verizon devices (that's LG, Motorola, etc) all suffer from a lack of creative design and ingenuity, because they are all pumped out quickly and with contracts, and because the manufacturers have little competition amongst themselves, because they generally operate in different niches, or on different networks. <p>This is why Apple's strategy is so revolutionary and is going to change the game. They've taken their crazy talent at creating easy and beautiful user interfaces and merged it with lots of leverage on AT&T's network in an attempt to remove all of what is bad about the cellular industry.<p>I think it's cool; the cell phone industry needs some shakeup now, just like PCs did in the late 90's.",1184144170

I think you're entitled to one more blog-based rebuttal if you'd like, but I don't want to burn out the topic :).",1184144022

Usually manufactures of devices like this are lacking in making sure my data is protected. After checking the specs I'm missing (for me at least) two basic requirements:<p>- please make use of https for logging into the device or using the apps on it. Lots of people use open wifi and are not using tunnels like the more technically crowd here on HN.<p>- Please make sure the device itself is fully encrypted. Devices of this small form factor are easily stolen and full disk encryption is at least making it harder for a common thief to end up with your personal data.<p>Without these measures I'm not really interested in using these devices for my personal use nor in advising others to buy them.",1320577071

The first game I bought was Civilization, for the PC. I have bought (a large proportion, at least) and played (many) dozens of games for the PC, everything from UFO: Enemy Unknown, to Populous 2, Black&White, Warcraft (1, 2, 3, WoW), Diablo (1, 2, 2X), Wolfenstein 3D, Doom 1/2/3, Dune 2 (and Dune 2k), C&C, Red Alert, Dawn of War, Total War, Total Annihilation, King's Quest, Space Quest, Flashback, Prince of Persia, Duke Nukem, Quake 1/2/3, Loom, the TSR/SSI rpg's (played through the whole Krynn series and the Savage Frontier series), Planescape Torment, Baldur's Gate, The Elder Scrolls Arena/Daggerfall, etc. I played them online and offline. I played MUDs till my social life withered to a pale, ghoulish shred of nothingness. I have never been much into consoles, but some of my friends have been, so I've played games (to completion) on the PS2, PS3, the original Xbox, the Xbox 360, and the Wii. I bought games on the XBox Live Arcade, and on PSN, and at the time (before the iPhone) I thought this was an awesome way to deliver games at the right price point, and it was the future of gaming.<p>I think I qualify as one of those ""real gamers"" - at least I did in the past.<p>Despite this long and varied history of playing games on many platforms, today, I own about 3 games on my mac (HL and clones, Trine, and Braid). I own about 40 on my iPhone and iPad.<p>Arguing who has the most influence is retarded. The unarguable fact is that the iOS platform is indeed having a huge effect on the games that I, a ""gamer"", play.<p>I look forward to the final annihilation of the console and PC gaming worlds when the Apple TV comes out.",1320576958

Unless you really-really-really need every last usec you can get :-)<p>The goal was just to show that sometimes JS code generated by some tool sometimes can be faster than handwritten JS code just because it tries to emulate something foreign (like low-level memory semantics) and thus reducing certain overheads. So one should be very careful when extrapolating speed shown by some project into effectiveness of the whole language.<p>[also I tried to stress the fact that speed is not everything there is to performance. If you have a long lived webapp in your tab you suddenly might become concerned by memory usage. Which is rather difficult to predict partially because of the ""hairy"" nature of the heap, the fact that VM tries to adapt to your app but doesn't always get it right, and the cost of the VM itself  (e.g. generated code and additional data structures)]",1320575783

Mongo will sooner or later reach a ""stable"" level as it matures just as mysql, postgres and all other datastores have done. I picked mongo due to the good fit it had to the problems I needed solved not only from the server perspective but from the modeling perspective. The ease of ad-hoc queries and the schemaless nature of the db lent itself well to the kind of problems I wanted to solve.<p>So even if in 30 years it's got the same characteristics as our current dominant data storage models I consider it a net win that I will be able to use a document oriented database for development over a more traditional RDBMS for some off my applications.<p>The richer our toolset is the better we are off as not every problems is a nail to be hammered in with an RDBMS.<p>So a high five to all the people who dare go against convention and take a chance on a new approach to data modeling being it Mongo, Riak, CouchDb, Redis, Neo4j, Cassandra, HBase or any other awesome opensource project out there.",1320575769

3202297,comment,3199907,3199907,1,0,drdaeman,,,"> It is stateless and uses no sessions or cookies.<p>Could someone please enlighten me how this should be done best?<p>There are a lot of cases where API must authenticate and authorize the user before allowing them to access the resource. To do this one has to use either self-invented scheme or HTTP authentication. Here're my thoughts:<p>- HTTPS X.509 certificate auth is nice, but unfortunately requires excessive user awareness, does not work in many browsers (at least, Chromium@GNU/Linux and Android), and, I believe, cannot be easily controlled from JavaScript.<p>- HTTP Basic auth is silly, as it requires browser to hold the password in memory for prolonged time period, and there are no sane methods to make the browser forget the credentials. As there's no notion of session, remotely revoking previously-open sessions is impossible, so the situation ""Oops, I forgot to log out at that Internet caf"" has the only one possible solution - changing your password.<p>- HTTP Digest auth requires plaintext password knowledge on the server side, so it has limited use cases. HTTP Basic problems apply here, too.<p>- HTTP OAuth1 seem to be the best available solution out there, but has a downside that it requires signature generation and verification on each request, and isn't natively supported by any browser I know of.<p>- HTTP OAuth2 is HTTP cookies reinvented. Except that, once again, no browsers supports it natively.",1320574064

That's pretty much the issue here -- ""cultural problems"" is just another way of saying the same thing.<p>Compare the code base of something like PostgreSQL to Mongo, and you'll see how a real database should be coded. Even MySQL looks like it's written by the world's best programmers compared to Mongo.<p>I'm not trying to hate on Mongo or their programmers here, but you've basically paid the price for falling for HN hype.<p>Most RDBMSes have been around for 10+ years, so it's going to take a long, long time for Mongo to catch up in quality. But it won't, because once you start removing the write lock and all the other easy wins, you're going to hit the same problems that people solved 30 years ago, and your request rates are going to fall to memory/spindle speed.<p>Nothing's free.",1320573881

Spending time to get software working for Windows is a pain in the ass. So now I'm writing software for Linux only because it's a lot more convenient in so many ways. Compatibility with BSD/OSX is something I can still think of (but for now, I'm Linux only and using Linux-only APIs like epoll, timerfd and SOCK_NONBLOCK).<p>If you actually get your software working on Windows, that's only the beginning. Windows users expect to find a binary zipball or installers and/or MSVC binary libraries. Making binaries is a fair amount of effort which I see as largely pointless because they're always lagging behind the source.<p>Catering to Windows users is also frustrating, since there are so few Windows coders and even fewer who are willing to contribute their effort to an open source project. Instead, you'll get bugged with a variety of support requests as if you have some kind of responsibility to ""fix"" your software to do what someone else wants it to do.<p>But the biggest problem in writing cross platform software is the lack of good cross-platform API's available. Windows users are never happy with x-platform GUI's like GTK or Qt. There are some frameworks for other tasks than GUI, but they tend to go with the lowest common denominator of the platforms they run on, which is usually worse than working with native api's.<p>Finally, I feel that there's no need to try to lure more Windows users to migrate to Linux. Linux has already passed the threshold of immortality and it will stay alive and well whether it attracts more user from Windows or not.",1320573770

ORMs like DataMapper (Ruby) and NHibernate (.NET) can generate the schema on the fly for RMDBS, so no need for migrations pre-production. But when your application is in production you need migrations even with a ""schema-less"" db! See, rename a field and ""all your data"" is lost, unless you migrate the data from the old field to the new one..",1320573736

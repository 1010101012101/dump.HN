If you manage to solve the problem I guarantee you a very comfortable living and a world-wide fame comparable to Guido's.<p>Do a google search on just about anything software-related and start calling these companies who sell millions of dollars of Windows-only software offering them a quick and painless transition to cross-platform GUI for, let's say $1M.<p>I can't even begin to describe the desperation I've seen at various companies I worked for. There are trillions of dollars worth of Windows software that is much needed on a Mac or Linux and vice versa. I once worked at a startup that lost a contract with US Navy worth more than <i>all our previous revenue combined</i> just because we were Windows-only. And at my current company our #2 support question is ""When's Mac support coming?""",1231095486

There are a number of special trees that are useful in specific domains.  Especially in a comment addressed at folks that weren't familiar with tree structures, this seemed important to note.<p>Other than that there's nothing in there I'd disagree with.  On splay trees -- they're not just simple to implement, they're also lightweight.  Often useful for the cases where you only half-way care.  Tries and B-trees obviously aren't general purpose.",1231095317

It's not doctors who I meant by ""healthcare"" - we're wasting a giant percentage of premium brain tissue on lawyers and medical equipment and drug sales force.

419359,comment,419012,419012,0,0,zupatol,,,"It's weird how he talks about 'winning' a fight. The point of a fight is to resolve a disagreement, and when it's resolved both have won. If one feels disadvantaged at the end, both have lost, since the same fight will probably have to be fought again. One advice he could have given is that competitiveness is completely out of place.<p>A strategy he does not mention is refusing the fight by not listening, or going for a walk, and later pretend that nothing happened. A friend did this to me recently. It may even be justified, because I was mad at him for things that no longer matter.<p>Still, I think the problem could have been solved faster and with less grudges by a discussion on the spot. I prefer to call it a discussion. If you avoid broken furniture, insulting generalizations, off the topic accusations, threats, and all the mistakes Crichton points to, you can hardly call it a fight.",1231094066

You left something out.<p>A better approach to figuring out how to charge for this is:<p>""what workflow do I anticipate my likely customers will have, and how would this product integrate into that workflow?""<p>You should also look at what other products are in this space, if any, and see how they price themselves.<p>All that said:<p>I'm not sure selling this as a service is the right approach.<p>You could set yourself up as a specialized consultancy (give us your tired old schemas, we give you a shiny new data-access layer using your choice of the current best-of-breed technologies), and just keep your code generator as your secret sauce.<p>Then you market your consultancy to various outsourcing shops, offering to take the initial persistence layer coding 
off of their hands for their new projects. You can turn around better quality code for this stuff, faster, than any of the sweatshop operations, and you're cost-competitive with the sweatshops, too.<p>I know the dream is to set up a service, let it run, then sit back and collect the checks, but the consultancy route might be an easier route to monetizing this.<p>Otherwise, I would attempt to negotiate big-dollar site licenses with large outsourcing firms, who probably stand to benefit the most from this technology (b/c they are the ones who most often are given a legacy database and asked to build systems on top of it).<p>If you go that route, being available over the web isn't much of a selling point.<p>For a trial versions, making an unlimited use trial for N months (N = 1, 2, or 3) available after a phone call works:<p>* the phone call step slows things down, but makes it much more difficult to ""farm"" an infinite # of free trials (!)<p>* since the primary value-add for this service is at the start of a new project, and since the typical large outsourcing firm has new projects starting all the time, a short-ish trial doesn't run much risk of giving the customer everything they'd want from the full product (b/c it only helps them with projects that were getting started in those months)<p>(!) If you go this route, don't hard-code a time limit, but do set up some automated emails to remind you when a trial is coming close to wrapping up. It's helpful as a sales thing to be able to extend the trial a week or two (or, at least, it's terrible from a customer's standpoint if the trial cuts off hard right in the middle of something).",1231092070

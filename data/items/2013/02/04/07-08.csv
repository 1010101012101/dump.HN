It's not exactly a step into the future but it's not really a step back either, when you consider apps that access phone capabilities (notifications, for example). For me there's also this notion of apps being registered on my phone for specific actions (want to share a photo? Use the facebook app). There are also places where I don't have net access, so having offline apps can be useful.<p>In an ideal world almost all of this can be transformed into what I imagine FF OS is trying to accomplish... but until then I am not exactly thrilled about it, but apps are not the devil incarnate either.

That one, yes I edited it twice, firstly because I felt my one-sentence reply was overly blunt, then again because having decided my original comment wasn't nice, I then felt neither was your [sic], so I added in my point about that too. Not sure it really matters too much when, one again, I made these edits within a minute of posting. I'll show an ""edit"" mark in my comment if there's a chance someone might have replied and therefore been misrepresented, but why bother when hardly anybody will have read it yet?

5162975,comment,5162972,5162972,1,0,FractalStan,,,"Using fractals, this social bookmarking tool tries to encourage users to bring the best resources on given subjects, socially, into an optimally condensed space, thus avoiding the tendency for the quality of content to become more spread out over the internet as the internet gets bigger and the best resources become harder to find. A subject is chosen for a page or 'celll', then branches grow out and branches of those grow out, but at no point are more than a fixed number of branches allowed to come out from any given point. This has the advantage of encouraging users to replace superseded resources and keep the best resources in the a space that doesn't grow. Visiting users are also able to post comments or suggestions for better links as each page has its own built in forum. Using this fractal design up to 256 links can be added in category and subcategory circles on a fixed screen that avoids the need for scrolling and allows users to find things spatially with practice. This opens up the chance of having these menus becoming part of interfaces with alternative control mechanisms, such as wired gloves or motion capture, with a 'safe-cracking' like motion with pinching and unpinching going in and out the interface and the resultant links. Because each page has a unique link pages can be linked together, thus making a fractal of potentially infinite depth as users link pages of theirs together and cellls of those who have created resources they rate highly, in a social menu system. Pages can be voted on, positively or negatively and this feeds the search on the site, which is limited currently due to the early stage nature of it. There are however there are raking tables which show the top rated cellls if users want to find the best resources that way. Free to use, was originally going to be ad funded, but decided to give it away for free. None of my friend have internet to I could do with some beta testers.

You can take the platforms' relative market-share and see if you spot the trend.<p>Apple's worldwide market-share has plunged from 50% to 14% in just a couple of years [1]. Android's intake on the market has been so aggressive even Apple is having a hard time keeping up.<p>Now, to be fair, these numbers are for smart-phones only and not for tablets, so the numbers dont represent the full truth. Right now Apple is definitely leading in tablet-space. But that was also the story for iPhone vs Android-phones a few years back. Android-phones were considered sub-par and iPhones the best of breed.<p>Where are we now though? Apple is considered the laggard and have to keep up with the constant stream of new and better equipped Android phones.<p>I suspect we we will see the same in tablet-space: After Apple has had the lead for a few years, it will see it's market getting eaten by Android and Apple will have to start playing the game of catch-up once again. Like they've already done with the iPad Mini.<p>It looks like history is repeating itself. And from these trends, estimating a future sub-10% market-share doesn't seem all that crazy.<p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/02/idc-android-market-share-reached-75-worldwide-in-q3-2012/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/02/idc-android-market-share-re...</a>",1359963106

Theories make true predictions all the time. The theory of gravity predicts that when I drop my pen it will fall, and that is a true prediction. As always, science is about making true predictions, and consequently is about truth.<p><i>> With respect to an idea, it means testable and potentially false. Truths are not ""potentially false"".</i><p>You keep claiming to be oh so more educated than me, but talking to you is like talking to someone who read half of a logic book in high school and didn't absorb it all too well, and missed any of the nuance for how logic is actually used, and then has convinced himself of his own expertise.<p>In formal logic, propositions are either true or false (or they may have no truth value at all), but we don't know the truth value of all propositions. Additionally, there are propositions for which we can know their truth value, and yet cannot prove their truth value using logical deduction.<p>A good scientific theory is expressed in a manner in which we might logically prove that it is false, but we can never <i>logically</i> prove that it is true. On the other hand, it is taken by scientists to be the case that a strong inductive argument can ultimately be made to establish the truth of a theory.<p>As mentioned above, an inductive argument does not provide a logically deductive proof for the theory, but is rather considered to be a probabilistic proof, which will eventually converge upon virtual certainty, given enough confirming observations. Note that we can still be 99.999999999999999999999999999999999999999999% certain of a truth of a theory using inductive reasoning, and yet it will still be logically ""falsifiable"".<p>You will note that nothing here about falsifiability implies that a falsifiable proposition is not true. In fact, there are an infinite number of true and yet falsifiable propositions. Science, in particular, aims to find, via the scientific method and empirical induction, TRUE falsifiable propositions in the form of theories, and to use these theories to produce TRUE propositions in the form of predictions about real events in the world.<p>With regard to any other assertions you have made, they indicate profound misconceptions for which I am no longer interested in dissuading you from. I will however put my money where my mouth is. I have worked professionally with scientists every working day of my adult life. I have implemented software for an X-ray space telescope, I have adapted brain imaging software to help analyze radio astronomy data, and I am currently working at one of the most prestigious biology labs in the world.<p>I have already pointed you at two famous biologists who say that evolution is a TRUE theory. When faced with facts that you do not like, you poo-poo them, with such assertions as ""science is not about titles and authority"". Well, it's certainly not about what you spout out of your butt either. I have given you plenty of reasons why your position that ""there is no such thing as truth in science"" is wrong. I have backed this up with my own argumentation, and with the argumentation of two famous scientists. I am also willing to put my money where my mouth is. I will bet you that I can find at least ten more real, working biologists, who have research positions at the aforementioned world-famous biology lab to go on record as supporting the statement that evolution is a true theory. And I will pay you ten to one odds if I cannot.<p>How much do you want to bet?",1359962522

It doesn't have to be that way, does it? :-)<p>The other concern is that you have to first find and then change code in two locations most of the time. On top of that, function signatures in the header are different than those in the implementation file, so you can't just copy them.<p>This last issue is a language issue and it is utterly ridiculous. There is no sane reason why you're not allowed to leave virtual, static or parameter default values in the code when you copy it into the implementation file.<p>[Edit] One more thing: If a language is designed in a way that makes it practically impossible to create a fast implementation, that is a language issue in my view.

The js API should take bytecode and a shader compiler (outermost loop) should be implemented in a safe script language via libraries.<p>- Very large API surface based on an 80s standard. This makes it much harder for browsers to support and test consistently.<p>- Extension mechanism makes it very hard to target consistently. A common problem in graphics is that every hw vendor wants you to optimize for the highest end in their line. Which gets you into the ""make the best case better"" optimization case when you really want to ""make the worst case better"".<p>- Serious interop/performance issues with js targets. Typed arrays are for example very important to a low level API like this.<p>- Low end support. Like Intel GPUs and mobile. WebGL is simply to big for testing and enforcing those constraints.<p>Sorry for ranting. :) Feel free to PM me for discussing 3D APIs for the web.

First of all, men still tend to seek more managerial positions and jobs in the private sector, making more money. Women have more part time jobs and jobs in the public sector. As Denmark taxes income on a progressive scale women end up paying less tax this way. Another reason is that women live longer and thus have more expensive retirements.",1359961523

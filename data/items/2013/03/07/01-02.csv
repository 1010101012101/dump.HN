It <i>can be</i> (note: doesn't mean <i>always is</i>) entirely different in scope to be a network trespasser than to trespass in real life.<p>The Allies executed Germans after WWII who never so much as met their victims, based only on the fact that they wrote, approved and otherwise perpetuated policies that caused millions on the same continent to later perish.<p>I'm not trying to say that Aaron or anyone else is killing people obviously, just that there's a lot of things you can conceivably affect on a computer network, which <i>might</i> make a computer-related charge even more serious than a similar charge in real life.",1362621588

I did a very simple bit of market research. I did a Word Tracker search for Ferrari rental New York City. Very straightforward keyword search.<p>I first did the actual search, and nothing came up. I said, Okay, well, all right, am I the only one searching for it? So then, with a combination of the Yahoo keyword tool at the time and Word Tracker, came up with an estimate that somewhere between 50 and 100 people per month were searching for the phrase Ferrari rental New York. Thats just New York City. It had nothing to do with any other part of the country.</i><p>Essentially, he did that before moving forward on other steps.

5335462,comment,5333508,5333963,2,0,smsm42,,,"It's not only inflation. The argument is making more low-skilled youngsters unemployable and thus preventing them from stepping on the lowest step of the skills ladder which eventually would take them to higher wages. It also precludes people that are unable to generate enough value to justify minimum wage from earning any income instead of completely relying on state assistance. Inflation can be counteracting this - since if dollar costs less, eventually the value of it would fall low enough so that value generated by an unskilled worker is worth the dollars state prescribes to pay him - but that'd take time, and getting on the dole is easier than getting off.",1362621451

5335453,comment,5334449,5335255,1,0,mpyne,,,"> However, the idea that the CFAA is the best we can do in the way of legislation is just laughable.

We can't make it perfect but we can make it a lot better than it is.<p>You're exactly right but careful about what you're arguing against.

5335452,comment,5334724,5334800,4,0,KnowledgeSponge,,,"While I love your site, I have to respectfully disagree with much of what you are saying here.<p>First, I agree on one main point--your site is not a ""startup"" or even really a ""company"" at this point.  That said, you still very much have a product, and you are actively monetizing it.<p>But then let's get into this point by point...<p>You say that your ads are ""non-targeted"" but that is not at all accurate.  Just because you aren't doing anything actively to target it, doesn't mean Google isn't.  Google's AdSense network has a TON of targeting on the back-end that is determining what ads to serve.  This can be based on the profile of the user, retargeting lists they may be a part of, the category of site Google has you categorized as (possibly health?) etc.  Your ads are VERY targeted. That is actually part of the beauty of the AdSense product.<p>The second point I really take issue with is that you don't seem to think your site falls into the ""if you're not paying for it, you're the product"" bucket.  Or at least that's how I parsed what you wrote there (apologies if I was off on that).<p>People aren't paying for your product, and so you are making money by serving them ads.  By the nature of it, any ad-supported site falls into that bucket.  You require more user impressions/eye balls and that is what you are ""selling"" to advertisers/Google.  This is not inherently evil, and I don't think one needs to prey on their users to leverage advertising.  That doesn't mean the saying doesn't apply to them though.<p>Again, I like what you're doing and think the single banner is a tactful approach (although you'd probably make a lot more by recommending sleep/health-related products and using affiliate links).  But those two things you said just aren't accurate so I wanted to clarify on those a bit.",1362621317

It needs to be addressed in the legislature before we ever get to the courts.<p>This is exactly the problem actually.

5335401,comment,5333508,5335104,5,0,Dove,,,"<i>The flaw in the argument is a basic type-error: Type MORAL does not match type FACTUAL.</i><p>I . . . think you must be thinking of someone else.  I didn't make a moral argument.  (Well, okay, I've made lots of moral arguments, but I haven't made a moral argument with you, in this thread. Yet.  At the very least, the argument we're supposedly discussing isn't a moral one.)<p><i>First of all, which data?</i><p>The data we're supposedly talking about.  My second link, like five posts ago.  The one you criticized for having the word ""Liberty"" in the URL. ;)<p><i>Now, at the margin, does the minimum wage disemploy some people? Probably</i><p>Oh, so we actually agree.  That's actually what I think, too: minimum-wage increases measurably increase unemployment among low-skilled people, but in the economy as a whole, the effect is lost in the underflow.  I suspect it's still there, but . . . you're right, lots of variables.<p>Sorry for simplifying.  I didn't mean to be misleading.<p>The reason I care about that particular unemployment effect is that minimum wage is supposed to <i>help</i> the people at the bottom.  But if it causes unemployment for them, then I don't think it's really helping them.  In fact, it's probably hurting some of them a lot.  The fact that it doesn't affect the rest of the economy that much either way . . . I don't really care about that.<p>So, if we agree about that, you think we should have a minimum wage anyway because . . .<p><i>A) Any wage below a living wage is either slowly murdering the employee or taking an implicit subsidy</i><p>I disagree.  Not every job is permanent, and not every job-seeker is independent.  Some people don't need a living wage: teenagers, retirees, spouses, students.  Some jobs aren't for income, but for reputation, experience, or skill-building.  Some jobs are side jobs: supplemental income.<p>Low-paying jobs <i>shouldn't</i> be permanent, and they generally aren't.  People move on (or get raises/promotions) as soon as they can do better.<p>And anyway, how is destroying the job a reasonable response?  The person who took it clearly thinks it's his best option.<p><i>B) The wage-level that a given business can support at a given level of worker skills is determined by many different variables</i><p>Sure.  I definitely agree with that.  I don't see why you think it's a reason the minimum wage is a good idea, though.<p><i>Implicit subsidies for [low-skilled manual labor] distort the market, both by suppressing the natural organization of labor and by padding the profit margins of businesses that use labor to substitute for capital investment</i><p>I . . . can't really make sense if that sentence.  I'm serious, I've been trying for like five minutes.<p>At a best guess, I <i>think</i> you're trying to say that eliminating low-skilled manual labor would force those sectors to replace the work with automation, which would make the world a better place for everyone.  Maybe?  I have no idea what you're saying about subsidies and unions, or how that ties in.<p>Regardless, that doesn't sound like a good idea to me.  The minimum wage destroys jobs indiscriminately, and some things are easier to automate than others.  Some businesses would adjust.  Others would disappear.<p>And anyway, I think if your goal is to automate things, there are better ways.  If you want the government to invest in infrastructure, for example, you won't get much argument from me.  Or maybe start a business yourself and do it better?  Surely there's a better way than hurting the poorest people in society.",1362620517

(I don't mean ""in theory"" snidely, I mean it in the real sense -- it's a defensible theory.) But here's the thing: there are states across the country that have higher minimum wage than the national minimum, and cities that have higher minimum wage than their states. This has been true for more than a decade in most of these places -- so there's been enough time for us to gauge the effects by now, right? If the theory was correct, most of those localities should have measurably higher unemployment rates in low wage jobs than surrounding localities, and most of those rates should not be able to be linked to other factors beyond the legislated minimum wage.<p>As it turns out, there's no substantive evidence this has happened. California does not, it seems, have a statistically lower number of minimum wage jobs per capita available than other states. That's true even in San Francisco, which has the highest minimum wage in the country.<p>In fact, there <i>have</i> been studies done on this. A lot of them. Generally they show either no effect on employment caused by raising the minimum wage, or at worst case a small negative effect. There's a fair amount about what economists think at this NYT article, including links to a few of those studies:<p><a href=""http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/04/what-economists-think-about-raising-the-minimum-wage/?smid=tw-nytimes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/04/what-economists...</a><p>While the polled economists are rather evenly split on whether they think raising the wage is likely to be overall negative or positive, there was stronger agreement that ""benefits of raising the minimum wage and indexing it to inflation outweighed the costs.""",1362619574

We are asking him to empathize with us - the least we can do is empathize with him.<p>First things first: Swartz is small potatoes. Holder deals with a lot of things, not the least of which is fielding questions about the legality of drone strikes on US soil [1], or writing memos about Gitmo or torture [2]. The handling or mis-handling of a single case is nothing to Eric Holder, especially since his boss is not up for reelection.<p>Second thing: the default position for any government leader is to back up your people. It's easier that way. If everyone in government backs up their people, coupled with unapologetic denials of wrong-doing, you have a much more comfortable government for one and all - at least between elections. But hey, 4 years of total autonomy is far better than suffering constant public scrutiny and having to react to it. This is even more powerful if you have the judiciary on your side and, since you're all on the same team, that's more likely than not.<p>In summary, Eric Holder doesn't care about this case, and has assumed the default position of someone in his station: deny-everything. It would have been quite remarkable, in hindsight, for him to have done anything else.<p>Clearly this is not a good outcome: we want an Attorney General who shares our sensibilities, and in this case, we wanted someone in that role who perceives the fact that the federal prosecutor overstepped their bounds and drove a sensitive soul into oblivion for actions which caused no-one any harm. We want someone who understands that <i>merely to be prosecuted</i> is a severe punishment in time and treasure. We want someone who understands the difference between someone who breaks the law out of a heartfelt spirit of doing the right thing, and someone who breaks the law out of malicious, selfish intent.<p>Sadly, I can think of no other way to address this problem than to keep this in mind for the next election.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/03/05/173572444/president-could-in-theory-order-drone-strike-inside-u-s-holder-says"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/03/05/173572444/pre...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/06/pentagon-iraqi-torture-centres-link?CMP=twt_gu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/06/pentagon-iraqi-t...</a><p>EDIT: P.S.

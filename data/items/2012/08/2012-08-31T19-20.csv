4461389,comment,4460398,4460398,38,0,jdietrich,,,"No. It is never more important to be kind than clever. Never.<p>We have a clear example of this at the moment, with the Paralympic games. The founder of the games, Dr Ludwig Guttmann, revolutionised the care of spinal injury in the UK. Until his innovations, a patient with a spinal cord injury had a life expectancy of less than two years, with most patients dying from bedsores and urinary tract infections.<p>Guttmann's methods were resisted all the way by his colleagues and the nurses working under him, because they seemed wilfully cruel. Guttmann reduced the sedation of patients, even if it meant that they were in constant pain. He had patients turned every two hours, day and night, even if they were terribly sleep-deprived. He forced patients to exercise and undergo painful physiotherapy.<p>The results were nothing short of miraculous. Within a matter of years, patients who were previously seen as hopeless incurables were being sent home to live long and fulfilling lives. The medics around Guttmann simply lacked the vision and insight to realise that these patients could be treated effectively. They were kind and caring people, but they could do nothing but dose their patients with morphine and watch them die.<p>Kindness is nothing but a particular sort of shortsightedness. Being a decent and moral person often requires one to do something that is entirely correct but deeply unkind. Medicine is the most obvious example, but we all live with such challenges every day. Do we give our children candy or broccoli? Do we tell a friend that their haircut is unflattering? Do we tell a relative that their partner is a philanderer? Often, the moral choice is not the kind one.",1346442745

So if you don't want to deal with the complexities of a possible resumption, simply call ERROR.<p>Similarly, the client, to establish the handler, can use HANDLER-BIND, which is the fully general form that permits resumption, or HANDLER-CASE, which is simpler to use but does not permit resumption.<p>In practice, most of the time people use ERROR and HANDLER-CASE, and so the extra complexity does not intrude at all.<p>OTOH it is occasionally handy to be able to resume.",1346442595

Changing jobs may result in another jump here or there, but otherwise pay is constant.<p>The end result of this is when you consider hourly rates a teacher just out of college makes more than an engineer just out of college(9 weeks vacation over the summer helps a lot).

If there's a better place to post this, please let me know and I will do so.<p>The site will provide two services:  
	1) A community rated aggregation of the best media curation resources on the internet.
	2) A community driven recommendation database for movies, music, books, and self-improvement media.<p>The site is made to adapt to what works for its users, functioning by combining elements of Wikipedia's administrative curating with the user rating and ranking approach of Reddit.<p>There's a lot more I can tell anyone who is interested about how the site will work and the plan for how to develop its community and content, but, for these purposes, suffice to say it will involve a system of user generated links and pages, an ability to wiki-edit content on specific items, and a database that enables a functional filter system for users to determine what results they see.<p>Because I have a minimal development background and am financing the prototype on my own, I am planning to bring a detailed wireframe, design, and plan for a site to an outsourced development company.  But, I feel I ideally need someone with a strong background of relevant experience to oversee this, as the more difficult challenges of setting this up the right way on the back end will most likely be outside of both my and any inexpensive development team's skill sets.  It should be a minimal investment of time, as the primary role would be thinking it out in the right way for someone else to do the work, but I'm not sure if it's a realistic approach.<p>Let me know your thoughts on this process and idea, if you think there could be people with relevant skills interested in working this way and the best way to find someone.<p>I'm very interested to hear any thoughts or advice you may have to offer.",1346442258

We can do the math. When it was time for me and the others in my group to start thinking about what to do next, we looked at the Computer Research Association numbers: 1500 new CS PhDs were made the prior year, and there were 100 academic CS positions open in the country. So our competition was roughly 1500 people plus more experienced people switching from industry to academia, or tenured professors changing universities.

Ads with intent drive clear, immediate ROI, but they can only ever capture the segment of the market that know what they want. Display ads on the web may not be the future of advertising, but it isn't going to go away, even if cable TV died tomorrow. In fact, the very fact that this discussion keeps coming up makes it pretty clear that there is a huge opportunity to innovate in this market. Maybe the advice should be: don't build a business that runs on static display ads, <i>do</i> try to find an innovative ad model that engages users <i>and</i> works for brands.

(Facebook makes $4B a year on advertising, so we're not talking about an insignificant amount of money here.)<p>That's really the most important part. These are the companies spending their money. Why do they want to ""waste"" their money on those sites if as the author states nobody goes there to buy things.<p>Two reasons:
1) That's where people are. People spend 8 hours a month[1] on Facebook out of an average of 32 total hours a month[2] online - 25%. A company would be stupid not to want to be seen there. I'm sorry, but if your business is selling things to the average consumer, the average consumer is on Facebook. They go there to be social with their customers, friend, like, share, and follow. That leads me to my second point...<p>2) It's not about selling (right now). The OP makes a huge assumption that ads lead to clicks lead to sales. Ever seen a TV ad? Do you think TV viewers stop watching the program to run to the store to buy Tide? No. It's about branding, having a marketing message and making sure everyone sees it. The 30-second elevator pitch. Then when they ARE in the mood to buy, when they ARE in the store, they think about your product. ""Hey, I need a new X soon, maybe I should check out product Y I've been hearing about.""<p>I can certainly see how people can think ""there's no intent to buy"" on Facebook and Twitter and maybe that's often true, but that's not even the point.

4461223,comment,4461055,4461164,15,0,hapless,,,"1. First item first: Gmail is free because the rich consumers using it are worth a few dollars a month in ads.  Those free users in Africa who don't have the money can only exist due to cross-subsidy.   The ad model helps them only by accident.  Until they have money to spend, they can only detract from the value of Google's ad inventory.<p>2. To address the second question, the cost of traditional media: Adwords made new businesses more feasible because of the intent harvesting.  It allowed people to pay to advertise to consumers who specifically wanted something, as opposed to a demographic block.<p>Instead of advertising to every 25-55 man who might want a corvette, they could advertise to men who were thinking about a Corvette <i>right now</i>.  Previously, it cost serious bucks to reach those men thinking ""right now"" because it was dumb luck -- advertise to enough men in the right demographic, hit a few guys who had the intent.<p>To a significant extent, the additional data provided by Twitter and Facebook is no better or more useful than traditional demographic data made available by TV stations.   Knowing you're a soccer mom with an SUV in Baltimore is only slightly more useful than inferring that from the market, income bracket, sex, and age group of viewers on a TV block.<p>Worse, a lot of that broad-demographic advertising is branding.  It will always be easier to make an impression with a 30 second full audio/video TV segment than with any kind of internet ad.<p>Twitter/Facebook targeting information might be revolutionary in combination with TV ad inventory.

With manual memory management you might need to lock the parent object before freeing the child to prevent some other thread from loading a pointer to the free'd child object.

I'd like to know if this is really true.  What if the game's fundamental problem is that players become bored over time?  What can a CSR do to fix this?  Probably not much.  The analysis shows that changes in gameplay frequency are far from a random walk and do indeed predict future declines, but it doesn't offer much in the way of clues for how to keep customers engaged.  What if it could be shown that a breakdown of a player's in-game social structure (I'm not a gamer, so I'm being vague) also predicts churn?  Perhaps helping the player to find some new relationships would be effective.  Is game play repetitive?  Maybe decreasing frequency of novel experiences predicts churn?  This would be good feedback for game designers.  Predicting the future isn't of much valuable if it isn't actionable.",1346439687

Much as Facebook would like to become the de facto Internet, I don't see it ever capturing that intent (let alone Twitter).<p>That being said, I think people discount what an inordinate amount of <i>good</i> advertising has done and just focus on the negatives (eg the ""shit you don't need""). For example:<p>1. While you might be able to afford a few dollars a month to pay for the cost of GMail, as one example (note: I have no idea what the cost would be here; I'm just making up numbers), would you? People are highly reluctant to spend on this. But more to the point, what about people in Africa or Asia for whom a few dollars a month is a significant sum of money? Those people can enjoy the same service with an ad-supported model; and<p>2. Traditional advertising channels (print, radio, TV) weren't affordable to smaller businesses. Things like Adwords have allowed many businesses to exist that otherwise couldn't before the advent of online advertising. How many jobs do you think this has created and supports?<p>But I do see the whole ""eyeballs-then-advertising"" SV model as peaking if it hasn't already. Facebook may well be the 800 pound gorilla that broke the camel's back on that one.<p>And while the author notes that advertising space is growing faster than purchasing power not all advertising space is created equal. What you simply has is a diversity of distribution channels for your advertising. That's a good thing. But not everyone will succeed with an ad-supported model, that's true.<p>To the author's problem of working on big problems, I agree. The fact that SpaceX spent less developing a launch system and reentry vehicle than was spent buying Instagram [1] with its 13 employees makes me sad that so many bright minds are working on the apocryphal social network for cats.<p>[1]: I realize with the 50%+ drop in Facebook's IPO price, that sum is now significantly less.",1346439658

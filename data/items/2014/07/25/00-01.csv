A non-existing or withheld reputation might require other checks (like a credit check), or verifiable references, for instance.<p>If thought through this might have uses.

A lot of this technology exists. CardSpace is one example of a client app (I wouldn&#x27;t use a web app to manage my reputation, but would be ok to use a service to let others leave feedback about me). Attribute provisioning in identity federation is another, and could be used as a mechanism to check someone&#x27;s reputation, or to give feedback.",1406249803
8083260,comment,8082902,8082902,2,0,kijin,,,"This is going to be a big problem for multinational corporations like Google and Microsoft in the coming years. In order to do business in Country X, they&#x27;ll have to censor all information that is objectionable to the citizens of X, even when citizens of other countries are trying to access it.<p>Google pulled its Chinese version a few years ago, redirecting users to the Hong Kong version instead. But Google only had a small stake in the Chinese market when it did that. It can&#x27;t pull the same trick with the EU. It needs to sell ads in the EU, and you can&#x27;t sell ads in a country while openly violating its laws.<p>Why doesn&#x27;t the EU take issue with the fact that, for example, the Internet Archive probably has copies of every page that EU citizens want censored? Well, to begin with, few people even know about the Internet Archive. But even more importantly, the Internet Archive has no presence whatsoever in the EU. It&#x27;s a US charity with US servers. So although it will never be able to get away with hosting content that violates American law, it doesn&#x27;t need to give a flying fuck about EU law, Thai law, Russian law, or whatever. Oh, the Saudis want to censor images of women driving cars? Feel free to arrest our Chairman if he ever visits Saudi Arabia.<p>I think this is exactly why keeping the flow of information distributed is so important to keeping it open. Different countries want to censor different kinds of information, so the <i>union</i> of censored information is huge, but the <i>intersection</i> is very small. If we become dependent on a few multinational corporations to access information, we&#x27;ll end up suffering the union of every censorship regime in the world (or at least the union of regimes where those corporations do business in). But if we keep the flow of information distributed, only the intersection need be censored.",1406249778

It is one of the most prestigious undergraduate colleges in the US.<p>However, it is but one of several schools that make up Harvard University, which include graduate schools like Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and professional schools like Harvard Business School, Harvard Law School, and Harvard School of Medicine.<p>There is overlap between the different institutions at Harvard; the Faculty of Arts and Sciences teaches undergraduate classes at Harvard College, graduate classes at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and performs research.<p>Harvard Extension School differs from many of the other schools in that it is not selective; anyone can simply pay to take a class. That means that merely attending Harvard Extension School confers considerably less prestige than attending Harvard College or one of the other schools at Harvard; all it means is that you paid for some courses.<p>Saying you &quot;dropped out of Harvard&quot; makes it sound like you were really brilliant and had a lot of promise but founding your own company held even more promise than finishing your degree. Saying that you dropped out of Harvard Extension just says that you took a few night classes and never really got around to finishing anything.<p>I took a few courses at Harvard Extension in high school. Some of them were really good, some of them not so much. A top notch school tends to offer a much more consistent program than Harvard Extension school. I&#x27;ve also attended another Ivy League school (group of very prestigious, fairly selective schools in the Northeastern US) as a full time student, as well as a flagship state school, and I can say that based on my personal experience, I&#x27;d rank Harvard Extension a little below the state school (which also had some really great classes and some mediocre classes), not up with the Ivy League school.<p>More info on all of the schools that make up Harvard University: <a href=""http://www.harvard.edu/schools"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.harvard.edu/schools</a>",1406249758

I happen to have done an 80/10/10 when I bought my house. That makes it look as though I&#x27;ve got way more equity than I really do based on the questions.

8083211,comment,8082902,8082902,4,0,cpa,,,"I understand that HN is on the side of absolute freedom of expression which entails that if anything has been public once, it has a right to stay to public till the dawn of times, so I hardly ever comment on these matters. I&#x27;m French, and I definitely do not agree with this opinion.<p>In 1978, the french government proposed to cross-reference (through digitalization) many of its databases (birth registry, healthcare, retirement fund, driver&#x27;s license…). It encountered a very strong resistance from the public, mostly because of an news article in one the biggest newspaper (Le Monde) titled &quot;SAFARI [the name of the project]: the hunt for french citizens&quot; (la chasse aux français).\nNeedless to say that such a system would have been a blessing for the German administration during WW2. It was 1978 and WW2 didn&#x27;t seem that far away, either your generation or the one of your parents lived during the war. That&#x27;s how France ended up with a law (Loi Informatique & Libertés) that regulates what one can do with databases storing personal information.<p>How&#x27;s that related to the right to be forgotten? Bear with me.<p>This law (and up to minor differences, the EU directive on the matter), makes explicit what I consider to be a very smart and important idea: &quot;purpose of data&quot; (finalité des données). Basically, before you&#x27;re authorized to store personal data (like email adresses, names, phone numbers, IP addresses[1]), you have to state what the purpose of this data is (to who and how is another matter, but that&#x27;s not too difficult).\nAlso, data should only be stored for a specific amount of time. This duration is determined by the purpose of the data. For example, if you have a database of all the people that used to be registered to your {nodejs,rails,lisp} newsletter but aren&#x27;t anymore, you cannot keep that data for, say, 10 years. 10 years doesn&#x27;t make sense given the purpose of your data. Note that if you anonymize the data, you&#x27;re good to go.\nOn the other hand, if you have medical data on cutting edge treatment of cancer, you may want to keep the data for 30 years if you need to contact a former patient when you discover longterm side-effect of your drug. And in this case, it&#x27;s fine.<p>You may start to see where I&#x27;m going. We have basically the same idea in the right to be forgotten. Yes, it impedes freedom of speech as american people think of it. Sure. But, you know, in Europe, we have a different freedom of speech, which also traces back to WW2. I can&#x27;t go around saying that I hate black people and that I&#x27;m a nazi. I&#x27;m gonna be fined/thrown in jail for doing that. And a vast majority of Europeans do agree with that. Basically restrictions are nothing that promotes hate/racism and libel (you can&#x27;t say that somebody&#x27;s a serial killer before he&#x27;s convicted for example.)<p>And you may think I&#x27;m backwards, turning away from the blinding beauty of technology (right to be forgotten? that&#x27;s not how the internet works!). Thinking that Freedom of speech as the US knows it is the way to go everywhere is universalism, pure and simple. So, please remember that countries and people have a history.<p>Yep, the internet doesn&#x27;t work that way. And I am aware the I can host my server in some random third world country and get away with mostly whatever I host. Or I can use a tor hidden service. But that&#x27;s not the point. 99% of these cases will be about data hosted by legitimate businesses, which have a name and address and that will be compelled to remove the data.\nIn my opinion, the slope isn&#x27;t that slippery. After all, you&#x27;d be hard pressed to consider EU countries as being way too censorshipy (?) — in general, not just when talking about Internet.<p>And yes, law will always be stupid when you pit it against technology. But unless you advocate total deregulation, it&#x27;s a matter of how much idiocy you can accept.<p>Finally, a thought on jurisdiction: european judges consider that they have authority if the intended public is european. So yes, google.es, google.co.uk and such are subject to european law. Wether or not google.com is subject to EU law has not been tested in court (it probably has, but I can&#x27;t remember any specific case), but even in this case, it would be perfectly acceptable (from the court standpoint) to alter google.com for EU IP addresses and leave it untouched for other addresses. So, no, nobody&#x27;s gonna tread your freedom.<p>Ironically, I don&#x27;t really have an opinion on Freedom of speech (US vs EU). But I find that the EU has struck a nice balance when it comes to that. Knowing that companies must destroy data that has my name attached to it when it&#x27;s not relevant anymore is very appealing.<p>In the end, the US and the EU, in this case, disagree on principle, which are like axioms. You can&#x27;t prove me that one is better (in the general framework of modern civilization, ie, let&#x27;s say The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to keep it simple.)<p>[1] this one is tricky, but this comment is already long enough",1406248759

The homeowner still has legal rights of her own, but the nature of the rental she agreed to means that she will have to engage in a more involved process to evict the tenant. If the homeowner did not want to deal with this type of scenario, she had every right not to rent her home for 30+ days.<p>In short, this has nothing to do with disruption or a lack of legal protections. Notwithstanding the fact that some AirBnB properties are being rented in violation of local laws and leases, AirBnB is simply a channel for marketing rental properties.

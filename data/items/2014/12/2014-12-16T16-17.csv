I&#x27;m not a TDD zealot but I often write tests in conjunction with a new feature. I&#x27;ve found that it makes the overall process faster, resulting code simpler and interface to the code more consistent.<p>A small investment of time writing tests before implementation yields the best overall results across the board.",1418749199

The article mentions high degree of literacy in the population, but I don&#x27;t think (public) schools were a thing then. So my best guess is about military service as a civil duty and literacy as part of early childhood military education. Not to say conditioning. I find that thought too pessimistic, anyhow.

8757954,comment,8756683,8756869,0,0,marcus_holmes,,,"Another rite of passage is the &quot;logger&quot; library, where every Go coder I know (including me) writes a &quot;better&quot; logging library because the standard one is so terse. A few thousand lines of code later, everyone quietly discards their overcomplex library and reverts back to the standard log.<p>The same goes for most of the standard library &quot;improvements&quot; that people make. Http middleware is necessary until you grok the power of Handlers, ORMs are prevalent until you get that it&#x27;s easier to write specific CRUD routines for your structs using the standard lib.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s austerity any more. I think it&#x27;s just putting a high value on simplicity, and I really appreciate that now I understand it better.<p>I&#x27;m happy to let the generics argument rage and smarter people than me resolve it.
I don&#x27;t need generics in my coding, happy to work around the occasional time I&#x27;d use them, but I understand the &quot;argument from make&quot; - if the Go team needed generics to build the language, then surely they&#x27;re a Good Thing and we should have them.",1418749165

8757825,comment,8757252,8757252,0,0,binarymax,,,"I&#x27;m writing this comment from a PolyBrowser tab :)<p>First of all - great job on shipping!  This looks great for a first version, and I think it has good potential.<p>Granted I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 10 minutes, here is some feedback I have so far.  I am using a fairly new Macbook Pro.<p>* panning between tabs is quite jittery and I get lots of jank when scrolling in general (vertical-in-tab or horizontal-between-tabs).  Optimizing this might have been low on the list but I think it would make a huge difference in experience if it were smooth and snappy.  I have a decent machine so I don&#x27;t think it is a hardware constraint.<p>* The interface is a bit bulky, and layout can be improved, and I feel there is some wasted real estate.  It may be a challenge to have visual cues for separation, but simplifying and cleaning up a bit would go a long way.<p>* When I focus on a text box or otherwise click on a tab, you should bring it into view.  I understand there is a good use case for typing something while viewing another tab - but not if I cant see anything at all.<p>* Probably just an issue for folks with a Mac gesture pad, but the swiping to pan from tab-to-tab also triggers the back action for a page.  Probably need to override the browser action and continue panning since that&#x27;s the action I started with.<p>Thats all for now!  Thanks.",1418747655

The list can usually be summarized as &quot;ways that Go is not Haskell&quot;.<p>Which is strange, because a post about Haskell tends to be about Haskell. A post about Go tends to be a lot of people telling everyone how Go is unlike, to its detriment, other languages. Great -- go use those languages.<p><i>Why people assume that only people NOT using Go are complaining</i><p>HN doesn&#x27;t have a large community of commentators, and you get to know the common personalities. There are absolutely people building solutions in Go who might think &quot;it would be nice to have generics&quot;, and indeed that&#x27;s exactly why they&#x27;ve never been discounted or denied by the Go team, simply deferred. But these discussions are dominated not by those people, but instead people telling you why Go is not Rust is not Haskell is not C# is not...<p>What&#x27;s the point? We have a lot of languages and environments to choose from, and we do. Why are people seemingly threatened by Go? It&#x27;s bizarre.<p>Generics are nice and they&#x27;re important, but there are a lot of nice and important attributes to a language, and they have bigger priorities. If generics were critical to my work, I simply <i>wouldn&#x27;t use Go</i> (and indeed, for some subsections and components, I don&#x27;t for that reason. Life goes on.

It&#x27;s somewhat of an advertorial, not just for a person, but for an idea: that someone at Stuyvesant (which is full of high-talent, mostly middle-class, students because the truly wealthy go to schools like Dalton that deliver Harvard if you show up for class, and Stanford as a consolation prize) can make $72 million on his wits alone. I would want to believe it, were I not knowledgeable enough on finance to smell the bullshit.<p>The current corporate world is built on lies, repeated often enough until they become truth (reputation, prestige, credibility). There are facts, and occasionally those hit back against an aggressive lie; but most of what drives economic life (especially at the individual level) is brand and reputation and social proof. How many corporate executives got there without lying about their CVs, polishing their career histories and accomplishments, and generally manicuring their reputations using a number of tools including deceit? Probably zero. Occasionally, some corporate executive gets caught in a lie and is scapegoated, usually because he was stupid and lied about something easily refutable like where he went to college... even though they all do it.<p>The sad thing here is that we&#x27;re talking about a teenager who (a) stood to gain next to nothing and (b) probably didn&#x27;t intend for any of this to happen at all. The disgusting thing is that, if he takes a fall for this, then he&#x27;ll have fallen not because of any deception but because of social class. A middle-class kid makes the middle-class mistake of (possibly) lying about something that can be refuted, and gets burned. An upper-class kid gets a $5 million seed round on parental connections and Stanford Welfare (a more pernicious lie, because it looks like merit) and gets away with it, being allowed to play CEO for <i>years</i> until &quot;adult supervision&quot; is brought in to administer a company that he <i>still</i> owns.",1418747275

Couldn&#x27;t a nefarious Tor user install some sort of outgoing packet-cleaner, which would spoof their outgoing I.P. address for all packets unrelated to Tor?<p>I.e: because the flash exploit didn&#x27;t establish two-way clearnet communication with the target computer, how can they prove that the outgoing clearnet I.P. was not spoofed?<p>EDIT: Nevermind, I was assuming too much about the operation of the exploit.

First, generate unboxed versions of functions where that makes sense. If specializations are possible for 1-bit, 1-byte, 2-byte, 4-byte and 8-byte primitive data types, expand those. Then for anything bigger, like structs, create a boxed implementation, because for structs there is no longer any advantage to working unboxed. Then make it possible to pass in the version to be used in a parameter, so you don&#x27;t have a combinatorial explosion when many type parameters are given.</i><p>That sounds sensible.<p>I&#x27;d like to figure out a way to extend the concept of interfaces to cover use cases like generic containers, but I&#x27;m not quite sure how that would work.",1418745665

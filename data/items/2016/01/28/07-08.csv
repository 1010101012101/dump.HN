This was way more productive than misspelling the property name of a json-field between serializing and de-serializing and spending a whole day troubleshooting that. This also automatically documented the format instead of sending an example xml-file to your counterpart who is to implement loading of the data elsewhere and saying &quot;the data will look aproximately like this&quot;. Viewing the data for debugging was done with a special program (similar to wireshark) that understood the protocol and rendered a much nicer view of the data than pasting a json-file into notepad++, there you need indentation and highlighting plugins anyway so the number of programs you need installed is not an argument either, streaming data through notepad++ doesn&#x27;t work so well either if you want to view data on the fly.<p>Security is also one aspect, at every place i&#x27;ve worked there is always one smartass that thinks xml can be created by string-concating, that&#x27;s impossible if the serialization-functions are totally encapsulated.<p>All this isn&#x27;t a problem inherent to xml/json as it can all be solved with proper processes, it&#x27;s just that it invites to that type of culture.",1453967638

You&#x27;re locked in to one server with your account. The server might shut down totally. The server might shut down federation (just like google did). Registering is another step hindering usage, Peer to Peer should be the way to go.<p>There are two things you need servers for: collecting messages while you&#x27;re offline and later pushing them to you, having a registration service for a nickname.<p>At least the first one doesn&#x27;t require accounts to be bound to servers at all. A model could be that message bouncing servers are run by the app developers. Friends computers that are running could act as bouncers.<p>Which brings me to xmpp addresses. They&#x27;re there to be able to initiate contact with someone you haven&#x27;t contacted before. Nobody is using the username scheme anymore, because it really sucks. Facebook uses a) real names, where you can search somebody with the real name and more importantly uses b) the friends of your friends in suggesting who you could add. You can easily implement the latter feature also for p2p messenger protocols. Other messengers often use other verified usernames like phone numbers, that users already have in their contact book. I don&#x27;t see how this is possible for a p2p messenger protocol.<p>> In the modern world, people are afraid of XML<p>It&#x27;s just mapping very badly to native data structures in any programming language except xslt.\nThis makes working with XML lots of work.

The biggest mistake companies often make at this stage is &quot;it&#x27;s not for us if it&#x27;s not going to be billion dollar business&quot; mindset. Apple should just go after every product that it can produce at significant improvement. Everything from kitchen microwave to digital picture frame to 3D printers to quadcopters to children&#x27;s toys is a fair area to explore. This will require balancing resources between mature products and new products, aggressive talent acquisition and product life cycle management that scales to 100s of products. Companies with cash flow like Apple should be announcing new product every quarter. Instead of trying to optimize for one product and get all possible thud for once-a-year event they should spread out their events over more eggs in the basket. Some of the products will only sell few million and may not move the needle but as long as Apple had good return on their total investment, it should be ok.For example, they can easily spin up team of just 10 people to produce digital photo frames and it&#x27;s not going to be billion dollar market but if it makes revenue in access of 10 million, it&#x27;s prett good ROI. Eventually the long tail of small products should be much more anti-fragile and sustainable for large margins.<p>This is exactly opposite to what Jobs wanted (focus on 2 or 3 things). I think Jobs philosophy was necessary as long as there was one super good guy who needed to make all the calls. This is extremely fragile system. A much better system is 100s of product designers working on 100s of internal experiments and 10% of those passes internal scrutiny on quality and advancement of art to finally face the market except that not every product is expected to become billion dollar market. Just 10s of million dollar market supported by small a team should be good enough. Create a long tail instead of keep looking for that lucky unicorn.",1453966848

Apple has made some really good VR/AR hires, but Facebook, Microsoft, and Alphabet have better teams.

More accessible university education, more people get university education, this raises the bar in all fields.<p>HR still prefers somebody who went through the trouble of getting the paper as it signals putting the effort in.<p>Now many jobs that previosly didn&#x27;t need university education have such applicants and it becomes more mandatory to get one in order to compete. And why would you not, it is free after all.<p>In the end more people get higher education. it won&#x27;t necessary help you getting a better job but I think it is good for society anyway.<p>For many others this &quot;useless over education&quot; is one of the reasons to introduce fees to schools. To make vocational studies worth more again and force people to think education more like an investment.",1453964557

The benefit of Github is the directory and collaborative aspect.<p>It&#x27;s much easier for people to contribute to projects now, and a lot of projects might not have grown as quickly without it.

Both case would opt for not fully committing. The answer will be in the details, such as his wording when talking about certain subjects, his mood and expressions when brainstorming and discussing different aspects of the project. Maybe it&#x27;s a little of both. The point is, it is pretty much impossible for us to tell whether it&#x27;s lack of passion or lack of confidence that&#x27;s keeping him from taking that leap of faith.<p>As far as how you should go about handling the situation, I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t offer too much help as I do not have any experience in this situation. However, I do not think it&#x27;s unreasonable for you to be pressuring him to call your raise and carry his own weight. The best advice I can suggest is to probably straight up talk to him and explain your concerns. After all, you guys are founding a company together, so you should be able to have discussions such as these as if it&#x27;s your spouse.<p>Good luck mate",1453964418

8189358,comment,8188949,8189072,3,0,rubiquity,,,"> <i>We should avoid making Elixir a Ruby-on-Erlang when it has the potential to be so much more.</i><p>I agree and share the enthusiasm. However, I feel like Elixir gets a bad rap just because how similar it looks to Ruby. I feel that other languages, such as HN&#x27;s current darling Go, and Node.js actually have way more Ruby/Railsism libraries than Elixir does. In Go, there are hundreds of libraries with the tag line &quot;Like <some Ruby library> but for Go!&quot;. The same goes for Node.js, but that number is probably in the thousands. In Rust, someone has actually tried to port ActiveSupport to Rust!<p>Syntax aside, the only influences Ruby has on Elixir in current day is the virtue of creating joy to use tools. Mix is a great example of this. Which is great, because that is by far Ruby&#x27;s greatest strength and is the only Ruby influence I would want in Elixir, having been a Ruby user for many years.<p>When you start to get familiar with Elixir, you realize it is far more influenced by Lisp/Clojure and Erlang than it is Ruby.",1408283229

Among the speculation was the idea that it was a way of flipping off the NSA, and like-agencies, by making their job harder by encouraging others to encrypt their traffic. In my opinion, this speculation now has more sturdy ground to stand on.<p>It&#x27;s a shame that we&#x27;re reduced to posting our outrage on the internet and left with no real actionable moves on the issue. We can fight it by working towards encrypting our data/traffic, but we can&#x27;t force a public conversation on the issue that would result in stopping the all-out effort to collect an analyze the actual data. We&#x27;ll forever be in a cat-and-mouse game over the issue. With the people involved in this having a significant leg up over the global community and always being one step ahead.<p>I get that this sort of thing can, and likely is, used to protect the general public from nefarious actors.

8189346,comment,8187457,8187790,2,0,gus_massa,,,"(You must be careful because this probabilities use the normalization \\sum(p_i)=1, but in quantum mechanics you must use \\sum(|p_i|^2)=1. I think that it&#x27;s an important difference, because it leads to interference and other interesting phenomena.)<p>The idea is that all the quantum values are complex, and the measurable things are of the form f.f*=|x|^2, you have a symmetry. If you multiply all the universe by i (where i ~= \\sqrt(-1) :) ) nothing changes. In general, you can multiply the universe by any complex z such that |z|=1. The global phase is irrelevant. This is the global U(1) symmetry of the universe.<p>But this symmetry is local. You can choose the phase of each point of the universe independently. The problem is that to compensate the arbitrary picks you have to introduce a new field that compensate for the differences of the local election of the phases. This is just the electromagnetic field. (I&#x27;m hiding a technical detail here.) This is the quantum version of the old electromagnetic field of Maxwell. The particles of this field are the photons.<p>I can&#x27;t find an &quot;easy&quot; information source (for someone with a math degree), but you may start reading: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics#Mathematics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics#Mathema...</a><p>The U(1) group has dimension 1, so you have only one &quot;type&quot; of photons. (This &quot;type&quot; is not related to the usual color of the light.) I think it&#x27;s possible to extend this to the quaternions group of module 1, but it&#x27;s a 3 dimensional group, so you would have ¿3? photons &quot;types&quot;. If all the new &quot;types&quot; of photons are massless, this should be measurable in the experiments. (If the new &quot;types&quot; of photons are heavy, you need to get a bigger particle accelerator to see them, or a theoretical physicist to prove that this idea is actually impossible.)<p>More technical details: The arbitrary election is called gauge theory, this is a local gauge theory because. The other symmetries of the universe is the SU(3) &quot;color&quot; symmetry that is behind the strong force. It&#x27;s the color of the quarks inside the nucleus it&#x27;s not abelian so it&#x27;s more complicated. The associated particles are the gluons, and there are 8 &quot;types&quot;. The other symmetry is the SU(2) that is the cause of the weak force, and the particles are the W+, Z and W-.<p>Actually the SU(2) symmetry is mixed with the U(1) symmetry. So the real U(1) group create the a version of the electromagnetic field that is related to the weak-hypercharge, and the photon and Z particles are a mix of the particles of the two fields. The mathematical idea is nice, because you have a copy of U(1) inside SU(2), so you can mix both U(1) groups and mix the particles. As an introduction, you can read <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction#Formulation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction#Formula...</a> but if you don&#x27;t want to dive in the technical details you can think that the U(1) group is (almost) the electromagnetism an live more happily.",1408282750

Especially if you&#x27;re a US citizen, because you have a lot of global geographic flexibility.<p>Living in a new country by yourself will make you pick up a lot of skills like those suggested here: cooking, staying fit, managing your sleep, etc and also what you suggest you would like to learn: be social.<p>Use online tools to find people to meet, or just walk out into the city and strike up conversation with strangers. You&#x27;d be surprised, in most parts of the world, people are happy to talk to a stranger who genuinely wants to learn from them. It takes a bit of getting used to, but you&#x27;ll eventually get there.

By now, you should be familiar with the rules in the <i>Player&#x27;s Handbook</i>. You&#x27;ve probably already noticed things you like or things you would have done differently. If you have, congratulations. You&#x27;ve got the spirit every Dungeon Master Needs. Curiosity and the desire to make changes, to do things differently because your idea is better than the other guy&#x27;s -- these are the most important things a Dungeon Master needs. As you go through this rule book, I encourage you to continue to make these choices.<p>Choice is what the AD&D(r) 2nd Edition game is all about. We&#x27;ve tried to offer you what we think are the best choices for your AD&D campaign, but each of us has different likes and dislikes. The game that I enjoy may be quite different from your own campaign. But it is not for me to say what is right or wrong for your game.<p>(...)<p>Take the time to have fun with the AD&D rules. Add, create, expand and extrapolate. Don&#x27;t just let the game sit there, and don&#x27;t become a rules lawyer worrying about each piddly little detail. If you can&#x27;t figure out the answer, MAKE IT UP! And whatever you do, don&#x27;t fall into the trap of believing these rules are complete. They are not. You cannot sit back and let the rule book do everything for you. Take the time and effort to become not just a good DM , but a brilliant one.&quot;<p>-- Foreword to AD&D 2nd edition&#x27;s &quot;Dungeon Masters&#x27;s Guide&quot;, David &quot;Zeb&quot; Cook, 2/9/89<p>Sadly, very few people paid any attention to that foreword (players because the book was off limits, of course ;-).<p>It&#x27;s a shame WotC/TSR didn&#x27;t go forward with the idea of an open rule set, rather than going back to the more traditional model. It is nice to see them borrow some ideas from White Wolf though -- to this day, if I were to recommend a [edit: single] rule set for role playing, it would be something between the old and new World of Darkness rules (aka the Storytelling System).",1408280524

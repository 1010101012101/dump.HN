The mind continues to work on it in the background while you do other things and then you can come back to it later from a fresh perspective, less frustrated and so on.  I told this to my son once when he was playing a computer game.  I walked past and he was basically spitting nails in frustration.  I told him to walk away for a time.  He did and when he went back later he was able to solve it, first try.<p>If the task is more physical, a physical break can make it more do-able.  I had to hook up my own washer and dryer by myself once and reached a point where I was very frustrated and couldn't make something work.  Napping allowed me to come back to the task and promptly put together what I had previously struggled with fruitlessly for an hour.

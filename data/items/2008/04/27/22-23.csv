175107,comment,174796,174796,0,0,Herring,,,"""Each age has its pinnacle of technology, and each age uses that technology as a metaphor for nature, for the universe. [...] Newton wanted a clockwork universe, the entire universe as a gigantic clockwork mechanism, with all the parts interlocking and ticking over with infinite precision. Then in the 19th century along came steam power, and the universe was then depicted as an enormous heat engine, or thermodynamic machine, running down toward its heat death. Today the computer is the pinnacle of technology, so it's now fashionable to talk about nature as a computational process. """,1209337160

175105,comment,174859,175086,0,0,wheels,,,"Here's the deal:<p>You've made the case that the reason that Mark Shuttleworth can't be African is because of his color.  But African-ness is not a skin color, it's an issue of identity.  For instance, I consider myself ""American"", though I neither live in America nor am I Native American.  You then backed that up with a terrible analogy about different kinds of animals.  You then extended that to say that because he's white, he can't serve as a roll-model for other people from the same place that he's from.<p>Is there a difference between black and white communities in South Africa?  Of course.  Might one of those be at an advantage in the business community?  Naturally, given the recent emergence from apartheid in the last couple of decades.  Is that genetic?  No.  Fucking.  Way.  Implying that it is is the essence of racism.<p>If you look at world history you notice quite quickly that cultures wax and wane in their world political / economic influence.  It's only been a few hundred years since northern europe was a complete backwater and classical arab culture was the center of learnedness around that part of the world.  The middle east is a mess these days.  What changed?  Did white people steal the ""rule the world"" gene?  Of course not.<p>Appropriately, ""Ubuntu"", is the African concept of unity of all peoples and races.  It is no accident that Mark chose that name for the project.  For you to come along and claim that he has no right to his identity because he's what you think is the wrong color for an African is pretty wonky.",1209337051

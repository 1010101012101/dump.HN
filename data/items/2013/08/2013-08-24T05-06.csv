Generally it is a big hammer and is applied to sectors, so there is an expectation of low success rates. That is why the government is doing it, and not private investors. This time they supported the &quot;green&quot; technology sector through allowing companies to apply for low interest loans, and giving consumers tax credits for those items. The next elected administration / congress might try to encourage the airline industry with fewer fuel taxes, the clothing industry with import tariffs, or support USPS by taxing the internet.

No. For sale by owner is a thing, and plenty of people buy without agent help. The only reason to use an agent is to have someone else handle your paperwork and if you&#x27;re selling, market your home. There is no law requiring you to use an agent.<p>In contrast, many states have franchise laws forbidding a car manufacturer from selling its own cars to the public.",1377323854

6267814,comment,6266863,6266863,1,0,pkj,,,"Most companies use a variant of stack ranking. If you agree with the core philosophy that more productivity => better pay, then you need to implement some sort of a differential pay algorithm. Having said that the implementation really sucks. It is not natural and continuous, rather people get pigeonholed into discontinuous buckets.<p>Let me take a concrete example closely mirroring my experience. There are 4 fixed performance buckets. Top 5%, Next 20%, Next 65%, Bottom 10%. They get hikes of 20%, 8%, 4%, 0% respectively. Again, these are fixed numbers. Let us assume there are 4 people A,B,C,D and out of a hypothetical score of 100, score 95, 90, 87, 85 respectively based on various parameters. You would assume that since D differs in ability with A by 10%,  he would get 90% of A&#x27;s hike. But sorry, due to the stack implementation he gets 0%, while A gets 20% !  Let&#x27;s say if the scores of A, B, C, D were instead 100, 50, 25, 5,  the hikes would have make much more sense.<p>Summary: Discrete curve of benefits works well only when it closely matches the curve of people productivity. This is rare. So it just ends up being unfair and creates an unhealthy rat race.",1377323738

6267804,comment,6263205,6267068,32,0,SiVal,,,"I&#x27;m speechless. Well, almost. Apple revolutionized the music industry, how music is sold, and how it&#x27;s listened to. It revolutionized phones. Its iPad changed consumer computing, media consumption, user interface expectations.... Five year olds are totally at home on an iPad and think a screen without touch &quot;isn&#x27;t working&quot;. As they get older, all screens will have to conform to the new reality. They revolutionized shopping for music, movies, and apps. They revolutionized brick and mortar retailing with the most profitable stores of all time.<p>And Google has changed human access to information so profoundly that I can&#x27;t adequately explain to my kids what it was like growing up in a world so cut off from things other people knew. Google Earth is something from science fiction. Street View lets me get to know my way around a town before I travel there. I can take my kids for a walk past my old homes in four different countries. Astonishing. And Google&#x27;s self-driving cars may make driving off-limits to humans in another few years.<p>Then there&#x27;s Microsoft, with thousands of smart people working for decades with billions of dollars of resources to work with---the most powerful of them all until what feels like &quot;recently&quot; to me. And the evidence of their innovative power: we have one of several game platforms, a billion-dollar write-off tablet that they can&#x27;t give away, and a kind of keyboard that accounts for less than 1% of keyboards in use today. Oh, and other stuff that &quot;didn&#x27;t become as popular as these&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not saying they never came up with anything new. I&#x27;m saying that relative to their size and resources, their innovations were trivial. Their huge impact on business, on consumer use of the Internet, on the tech industry, on governments, and so on, came not from revolutionary innovation but primarily from their relentless efforts to monopolize markets.<p>Of course, the lifeblood of a company is profit, not innovation. Without subsidies from ad revenues, Google&#x27;s innovations could dry up quickly, and cheap knock-offs could eventually take away most of the markets Apple has revolutionized. But even if their profits prove short-lived, their amazing contributions to society will live on. I doubt many in the future will feel the same about Microsoft&#x27;s contributions.",1377323426

In the old way, there&#x27;d be no standard way to cancel something like this,<p><pre><code>  xhr.get(url, function (data) {

When you say &quot;_the_ pain and horror&quot;, you are (whether intentional or not) referencing the primary pain felt - that of those directly and most significantly affected by 9/11. In doing so, you dilute the gravity that referencing that pain carries for true victims.

6267794,comment,6267478,6267726,1,0,30thElement,,,"There&#x27;s 2 reasons on top of the generic problems with vertical integration, at least that I know of. First, once an independent dealership opens, they&#x27;re gonna forever be afraid that the manufacturer is going to cut off their supply and then open an official dealership next door. It screws up the value equation for opening a dealership in that the small family owned business takes all the risk so the giant mega corp can swoop in and take all the profits once they finally show up (at least that&#x27;s how you pitch it to the voters).<p>Second, dealerships make their money off of the maintenance as well as the sale. Allowing the manufacturer to dip into that maintenance revenue stream will create perverse incentives that hurt consumers.<p>The first one doesn&#x27;t really apply, as Tesla has the capital to start all of the dealerships they need and that&#x27;s basically what they want; they don&#x27;t want 3rd party dealerships popping up at all. The second one applies to Tesla, but I don&#x27;t think it really matters.

The Xbox is amazing, the Zune HD was amazing, Windows Phone is a great product, and I&#x27;m sure Windows 8 has its strengths (I&#x27;ve never used it).<p>I&#x27;m not in the position to say so, but I believe Microsoft&#x27;s problem is either one of leadership or culture. Microsoft doesn&#x27;t innovate, its a &quot;me too&quot; company in the consumer space. Zune, Windows Phone, and to a lesser extent, Xbox are all &quot;me too&quot; products. Even worse, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any incentive to switch. What does WP have that the iPhone doesn&#x27;t? Now What does Android have that the iPhone doesn&#x27;t? You can argue that Android copied iPhone, but Google didn&#x27;t just copy it, they made a conscious effort to take risks and go one step above. I haven&#x27;t seen that with Microsoft.<p>It seems to me any consumer decision that doesn&#x27;t either 1.) Make more money for an existing product or 2.) Attempts to step into a well known, fast rising space gets killed. The biggest example in my mind for this was the Courier. The Courier was first hinted at in 2008, 2 years before the iPad. Someone at Microsoft had a hunch (because Microsoft has a ton of smart people), that this wave was coming and created a brand new experience. It wasn&#x27;t me too, and it wasn&#x27;t a proven market. It was innovation and vision. And we all know how it turned out, it was killed because it couldn&#x27;t sell more copies of office[1], and instead we got the HP Slate, which was lackluster, and then the Surface, 4 years later which ended up being written down.<p>At the end of the day, I don&#x27;t see Microsoft taking any real risks in the consumer space (aside from Xbox).<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-10805_3-20128013-75/the-inside-story-of-how-microsoft-killed-its-courier-tablet/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-10805_3-20128013-75/the-inside-sto...</a>",1377322933

That of course doesn&#x27;t explain Fisker....<p>* Many of us started believing in Tesla almost immediately after hearing the 3-part business plan: Build a ridiculously fast, desireable sports car (which they did, and brought it to market long before the DOE loan), then build a luxury car, then build a mass market car. I had a sense Tesla would do well with this plan, for the same reason I think Square will do well where others will fail: You need more than a viable destination, you also need a viable stepping stone at every point between zero and profitability. Tesla always had this plan. It was a good one. It&#x27;s proving itself to be a good one.<p>* Did I mention they already had built, brought to market, and made real revenue off a car?

(I enjoyed reading it of course!)<p>Things like this make me wish I had the time to blog (I don&#x27;t I can barely find the time to comment on things I&#x27;d rather make money but not the type that you get paid if you get paid to write for medium).<p>I enjoyed what you wrote by the way.",1377320811

6267702,comment,6266863,6267286,5,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> They felt this was a great system because a company with ~100K employees was bound to fit a bell curve regardless of its ability to hire and retain &quot;the best&quot;.<p>This isn&#x27;t true at all.  If you have the ability to hire and retain the best, then the company curve will look like the rightmost extremity of a bell curve, which has rather different properties compared to the entire curve.  As I understand it, this is why baseball statistics value players in terms of &quot;wins above replacement&quot; instead of &quot;relative to the average player&quot; -- the average player is so much better than the majority of professional baseball players that it&#x27;s not useful to assume in your tooling that you could hire one.  (Whereas, if you have the entire bell curve, then the average person is both median and modal, and is therefore easier to find than a person at any other level.)<p>Disclaimers -- I don&#x27;t know statistics, corrections very welcome.",1377320788

Was there any pre-investment indicator that Tesla was more likely to succeed? Did it have something that others didn&#x27;t?",1377320478

Both characters come off as more interesting and in a weird way, likeable than their real-world counterparts.  Even Jobs is far more charismatic in PoSV than in real life. PoSV came out when Microsoft was in its prime and its portrayal of Gates was in many ways similar to that of Zuck in TSN, but it didn't seem to hurt him any.",1296367193

Climate change is a nice example for the tragedy of the commons. My suspicion that tweaks which require many changes in many different areas won’t cut it is somewhat founded on that.<p>Incentives work wonders if you want all people to do something differently, like renovating their house to add better insulation. Governments could try to create incentives but have generally been unwilling to.

2157471,comment,2156877,2157174,0,0,GrandMasterBirt,,,"""ip"" = iphone, ipad, ipod touch<p>Lets debunk a few problems with the article:<p>1) Why was there 3 antivirus tools installed. Generally its a bad idea.<p>2) OMG ANTIVIRUS S0X0RS! I WILL BUY L33T H4X OS THAT HAS NO VIRUSES! Get over it. Windows is the most popular consumer-grade os EVER to date. Exploits exist for it. Wait hold up, remember the ipod explot that roots your ""ip"" by going to a website and clicking a button which exploits a PDF reader problem? THAT GAVE YOU UNLIMITED ACCESS TO THE OS AND UNDERLYING EVERYTHING. It was used for good, could have been used for making your system a pure spambot using up your wireless data limits. Sorry dude, you suck.<p>3) The game maker no longer exists. So basically you are expecting a game that is very old to just work on any operating system that has a Windows in it's name without a compatibility upgrade especially when coming to Win 7 (a improvement on lots of cruft that was on xp). Maybe windows defender WAS right and the damn disk had a real virus on it, oh wait did you have a hacked copy? Try using old mac os (pre x) programs on osx. There will be issues. Shitty performance is a big one. I cannot play warcraft 2 on a ppc running 10.4 because it requires an old macos and does emulation, the hardware requirements for warcraft 2 is a 166mhz processor damnit. Ever hear of problems running new games on old versions of ""ip""? Well sorry the market is so tightly controlled that you can't even install it on the ""wrong"" device. If the game existed for the ""ip"" and was not compatibly your article would have been ""to play this game: turn on my ipad, jailbreak it, fuck up, brick, get a new one, jailbreak, install game, does not work, get pissed, damn you steve jobs! this is why balmer is l33t h4x0r"" please see the flip perspective of this whole mess. If you tweak windows just right you can probably get this thing working. Worst case install XP mode that MS provides and get windows xp full compatibility WITH a sandbox so it can't hurt you. So windows actually wins in this one.<p>4) Windows updates... ah the age old story. Sorry dude, I had times when I spent 4 hrs upgrading windows in an office; they had not run windows update in 5 yrs. You gotta run this shit incrementally. Just connect once a month and let it simmer. You CHOSE to wait while it worked vs just letting it download and install when you are shutting the machine down. Notice you didn't follow the ""measure twice, cut once"" approach. You didn't try to see what is the problem with the game and look up to see the company not existing that probably its just incompatible crap, instead you chose to assume your approach of waiting for the update was the only good solution and the right one.<p>I always right-click drag executables to desktop, asks me what to do like create shortcut. It even gives you VISUAL hints as to what it wants to do while dragging. Yes it could be better like assume dragging a .exe/.bat file onto the desktop = create shortcuts (seriously MS, small bug, been how many years? and still not fixed)<p>EDIT: Sorry I missed the java update. There is no JVM on the ipad. You can't run java apps on it. The end. MS Does not control java, you chose to install it on your machine, deal with it. Don't want it, dont use java tools. Not to mention that you can redistribute the OpenJDK with your application as part of itself so there is no requirement to have java installed and running on your machine, it can just be packaged with say your game or application and just run without any update nagging. Not MS's fault.<p>I hate MS just as much as the next guy, but please put blame where blame belongs.",1296365415

2157429,comment,2157233,2157233,0,0,pshapiro,,,"The article makes some big assumptions. Like for example the idea that switching to the renewable energy sources referenced in the article would solve the phenomenon of global warming. The article references human inertia as the only obstacle left but one of the fundamental assumptions made is that simply switching to the alternative sources referred to would allow the environment to recover before it collapses. That's another kind of ""inertia"" (karma). I have never seen any any solid proof presented by mainstream scientists about the actual cause of global warming. Is there a concrete chain of cause and effect that relates by quantity the amount of emissions with the exact changes in Earth surface temperature?<p>Besides all this, lots of the renewable energy sources turn out to require more energy to produce and set up than they are able to recover over the span of decades (like wind farming, which is very costly to mine the materials, ship them out, set up, and get going). The article mentions the fiscal cost of setting up these alternative sources but apparently that's not the only thing standing in the way either.<p>My point is that this article paints a highly idealistic portrait.

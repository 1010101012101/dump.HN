Well I'm a geek and I use it because it's the best system for what I do (writing Linux hosted server side stuff) so why do I care what the rest of the market is doing?<p>I guess there is some merit to this argument in the sense that if Linux was the defacto standard on the desktop I wouldn't have to maintain a dual boot. On the other hand I quite like using a niche OS because it means that I'm not a target for malware/shovelware/adware vendors.",1346720397

I tried to get Sun back into the workstation/desktop game from afar (I had already left by that time) but it wasn't to be. Their original business model is just as durable today was it was when they were founded, spec the hardware, do enough software work that the user experience is capable, and let others build on that. I keep hoping someone will do that with FreeBSD but so far, no such luck.<p>[1] We can use the existence proof that FreeBSD exists with a bsd license and it hasn't materially changed the Linux outcome.",1346720370

4472420,story,,,3,1,galapago,"Processing and predicting arbitrary sequences of inputs using libmind",,"Hello!<p>I would like to present a small project i was working during the last months. 
It aims to solve the problem in Machine Learning of processing sequences of inputs, instead of a fixed size vector that many algorithms requires to perform classification or regression and also providing a minimalist interface to learn and predict sequences in almost any domain.<p>The basic idea is to use an Echo State Networks (http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Echo_state_network) to generate a single fixed size vector in R^n from a sequence of inputs of vectors in R^k. Then, we can use this representation to perform some kind of classification or regression. Also, a dual procedure can be used to reconstruct a sequence of vectors in R^k from a fixed size vector in R^n.<p>This project is called libmind:<p>https://github.com/neuromancer/libmind<p>It is also designed to be a simple way for a programmer to learn sequences of arbitrary elements, as long as they can be vectorized.<p>In the repository of libmind two examples of its use are included:<p>* Identification of part of speech (POS) of English words only using their letters.<p>* Reduction of variableless propositional logic formulas.<p>I would like to hear if it can be improved and/or extended. So, in the spirit of open research, i'm publishing all the code, data and instructions, so anyone can view and improve this small project.<p>Thanks!",1346717312

    request upload access for a package, providing details about
    their association with the upstream project. If the submitter is
    not the owner or representative of the project, they will be
    required to provide a URL to a webpage, blog post or mailing list
    archive showing that the owner or representative of the project

It talks as if I&#x27;ve already made a move, but I haven&#x27;t made any moves.  This is totally confusing.<p>Update: Ok, I read the Wikipedia article and it mentioned that long-range pieces can skewer.  That&#x27;s interesting.  I had never thought of grouping the pieces into long-range and short-range attackers, but that makes total sense.  I see now that both pins and skewers are really tactics for long-range pieces.  They&#x27;re ways for you to control parts of the board &quot;at a distance&quot; by forcing your opponent to move or stay put.<p>There might be situations where a short-range piece could pin or skewer, but I can also see how that would be more precarious.  Both pieces being pinned or skewered would have to be close together and the attacking piece would have to be close to both.  This means you&#x27;d probably be in &quot;enemy territory&quot; and your attacking piece more vulnerable to attack.<p>With a long-range piece you don&#x27;t have to worry about any of this.  Your opponent would have to enter your territory to halt the pin or the skewer.<p>That seems like an important distinction to understand.  I look back on some of the things I was doing in previous exercise and they make no sense in light of this distinction, e.g., moving pawns around like a monkey trying to pin and skewer things.",1376891155

6235830,comment,6235450,6235450,25,0,jfarmer,,,"So, I know the basic rules of chess, but I&#x27;m terrible at the game because I&#x27;ve never practiced.  This site looks neat!<p>I also spent the last two years designing curriculum to teach folks how to program.  I have some issues as a student.<p>I&#x27;m currently on the &quot;Sharp Pin&quot; exercise: <a href=""http://chesscademy.com/exercises/the-sharp-pin-that-piece-isn-t-going-anywhere"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chesscademy.com/exercises/the-sharp-pin-that-piece-is...</a><p>I get the basic idea.  You have a piece which can&#x27;t move without exposing a more valuable piece to attack.  Here&#x27;s where I get confused.<p>There are three pieces involved in this situation: the piece you might want to move, the more valuable piece you would expose, and the piece that would attack.  Let&#x27;s call these pieces M, V, and A, respectively.<p>It&#x27;s unclear when you say &quot;X pins Y&quot; which of M, V, and A can go into X and which can go into Y.<p>Now, if I&#x27;m confused about this, look at the hint: &quot;Try pinning the knight to the king&quot;<p>Pin whose knight to whose king?  If I&#x27;m confused about the syntax of pinning this hint doesn&#x27;t help me at all.  It&#x27;s all the more confusing because I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by &quot;the&quot; king.  There are two kings on the board, right?  Which is &quot;the&quot; king?  It&#x27;s worse with &quot;the&quot; knight, since there are four knights on the board.<p>Now, I spent about 15 minutes parsing out what you meant and saw what was intended.  However, I started doing some no-no student things along the way.  At first I tried to understand what the sentence meant.  I looked at the kings and knights and tried to imagine how one would pin one to the other.<p>&quot;Pin the knight to the king.&quot;  Well, the king is the most valuable piece, so it&#x27;s probably V in this formulation above.  But is the knight the M or the A?  Now I&#x27;m looking at the knights on the board, thinking about moving them around, and I don&#x27;t see how any move I make could be consistent with the instructions.  Hmm, ok, so the knight must be the M which means it must be one of the black knights.<p>You can see already how I&#x27;m not really thinking about the problem but trying to reverse-engineer what you mean.  I&#x27;m doing this because I don&#x27;t have a clear picture what &quot;pinning&quot; means in my head.<p>Now, when I think about moving pieces, I look at the board.  What piece should I move?  Well, I dunno, the pawns are out there and are near a knight.  Maybe that&#x27;s what pinning means?  I&#x27;ll move the pawns in the center and see if it yells at me.  Ok, it yelled at me both times.  What other piece could I move?  Maybe I was wrong about knights being the M, so let&#x27;s try all possible knight moves and see if the system lets me make any of those moves.  Nope, ok, those are all bad.<p>Yikes!  Now I&#x27;m just guessing and relying on your system to tell me what&#x27;s right or wrong.<p>Ok, obviously the problem is I&#x27;m confused about WTF pinning means.  How can I see some examples of pinning?  I don&#x27;t see anywhere on this screen.  So, I go to Wikipedia and read the article on pinning.  Ah, I see, &quot;X is pinned to Y&quot; means X can&#x27;t move without exposing Y.  So, maybe &quot;Pin X to the Y&quot; means move some piece into a position where &quot;X is pinned to Y.&quot;<p>Ok, well, the knight and the king are lined up diagonally, so the only way the knight could be pinned to the king is by a bishop.  Oh, look!  Ok, I can move that bishop.  Yay!  I get the gold star.<p>This sequence of events is a problem on several levels.<p>First, most students wouldn&#x27;t keep at it like I would.  They also wouldn&#x27;t have the self-awareness to see that their first priority is to deconstruct the ideas you&#x27;re trying to express and reframe them in a way they understand themselves.  They most likely wouldn&#x27;t look to outside resources like Wikipedia, either, because they&#x27;d get &quot;tunnel vision&quot; on the current page.<p>Second, you confused me by talking about absolute and relative pins.  I don&#x27;t know whether I&#x27;m going for an absolute or relative pin in this exercise.  The hint gives it away, but only by process of elimination.  That is, &quot;This must be an absolute pin because otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t make sense for a king to be involved.&quot;<p>Third, although I eventually get the &quot;right&quot; answer, my path to that answer looks nothing like the path an expert would take.  What hint can you give that suggests not just the proper outcome but encourages expert-like habits in the student? I don&#x27;t know enough chess to suggest, but here are some ideas.<p>&quot;Think about what moves your various pieces can make.  Are there any avenues of attack that line up with those possible moves?&quot;<p>&quot;To pin the black knight to the black king, you need to move one of your pieces so that it is attacking the knight and would be attacking the king were it not for the knight&#x27;s position.&quot;<p>This latter hint is nice because it also reinforces previous lessons about attacking, including the forking exercise which also involved attacking two pieces at once.  Now I&#x27;m relating this current situation to a previous one, and it makes me think there might be some interesting relationships between pinning and forking.<p>Anyhow, just some thoughts from a guy who spends too much time thinking about curriculum and pedagogy!",1376891056

6235768,comment,6229817,6235689,3,0,hackinthebochs,,,"I don&#x27;t disagree with any of your examples, but I would interpret them differently. There is certainly a fair amount of &quot;extrapolating&quot; going on subconsciously. Our brains attempt to extract higher level meaning from sensory input (such as rotation or relative size of objects). This is a sort of knowledge that is based on the totality of sensory input received up until that point (i.e. the experience that a silhouette is likely a 3D object that is spinning in a particular direction). But I don&#x27;t consider this knowledge as being distinct from the sensory input itself, rather an abstraction over a set of similar inputs that give it meaning.<p>Personally, when I imagine a horse, I don&#x27;t imagine some abstraction of a horse. My subconscious minds pieces together chunks of images from my experiences with horse-images and puts together something reasonably close. The stuff of mental computation to an extent is our memories of sensory inputs themselves, or abstractions over similar classes of inputs.<p>Thinking about it further, our ideas may not be as far apart as they seem.<p>Do you consider the &quot;sensory input&quot; as, say, the light waves hitting the retina, or the set of neural states triggered that induces a &quot;qualia&quot; experience of sight? In my explanation I was considering the qualia as the sensory input rather than the frequencies of light. Perhaps you&#x27;re using the other definition?",1376889559

Although I have worked with displays of various sizes, I presently own a total of four 30&quot; LCDs and two 24&quot; LCDs spread across my two main workstations.  I invest heavily in displays at the expense of nearly everything else.  I believe very strongly that displays are the crucial piece of hardware whose stagnation is keeping desktop computing from evolving [1].<p>So I pretty strongly agree with the article&#x27;s thesis that learning to program is in part gated by the availability of a high-quality desktop-grade set of gear.  (Whether it&#x27;s truly a desktop computer or a laptop made to behave like one is a detail that I don&#x27;t really care about; though I&#x27;ve never seen a laptop with three dual-link DVI ports.)<p>I agree that once you use a large display, you absolutely do not want to go back to a small display.  I contend that if I could buy a 50&quot; high-DPI display for my desktop that once used, all of my current 30&quot; monitors would feel antiquated and feeble.  Suitable for the recycle bin.  And I&#x27;d love that.<p>Moving my eyes and/or turning my head is <i>so</i> much faster and productive than flipping through a stack of windows using even the best window manager.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not sure why there&#x27;s a thread here that says that some languages may see less benefit from large displays.  Java is cited by name.  I do Java web development and with Eclipse, code is compiled and hot-reloaded by the application container as I work.  Modern Java is definitely sufficiently fast-paced to benefit dramatically from lots of screen real estate.  One way to put it is that my app has been recompiled and hot reloaded well before I can find the browser window on a small display.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tiamat.tsotech.com/displays-are-the-key"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiamat.tsotech.com/displays-are-the-key</a>",1376889291

E.g.,\nInternet service providers (ISP)\nmake heavy use of <i>dynamic host\nconnection protocol</i> (DHCP)\nwhich assigns a new IP address\nfor each new connection from\na user.  And, for a user permanently\nconnected via a cable modem,\nlosing power to the modem commonly\ncauses it to forget it&#x27;s assigned\nIP address and when power is on again to request a new\nIP address from the ISP.  Also,\ncommonly ISPs change user IP addresses\nfor whatever reasons without notice.\nReally, a user often doesn&#x27;t know\nwhat IP address he is using.<p>Fixed IP addresses are important for\nservers but not for users.  And due to\nthe fact that with 32 bit IP addresses\nthere are only about 4 billion IP addresses\nto serve the whole Internet, ISPs\ncommonly assign a new IP address for\neach connection and may have\nfewer IP addresses than paying\ncustomers.<p>A Web site has no easy way to know that\na specific IP address is from a \nspecific computer or a specific person.\nAnd, indeed, just by having electric\npower go out, the user&#x27;s computer\nwill likely be using a new IP address.<p>So, for a Web site to block an IP\naddress does not block a specific\ncomputer or specific user.\nSo, a user can just say,<p>&quot;That\nyou got some traffic from that IP\naddress is no evidence that \nI accessed your Web site.

Then <i>screen\nscraping</i> is just keeping what was \nsent.  The Web site sent the text;\nthe user just kept a copy; keeping\na copy at least until the original\nchanges is a standard performance\nfeature of Web browsers.

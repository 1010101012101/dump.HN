7187998,comment,7187041,7187677,15,0,antics,,,"No profit model? Completely wrong.<p>According to the IPO docs they make about $2/1000 views in America (which is good) and were projected to make $1 billion in revenue this year (also good). This article reports that their first quarter revenue is about $250 million, more than double the previous year, which makes their prediction definitely feasible. The remaining question is whether they can turn this revenue into profit, and my answer is yes, because (1) the growth of their operating costs is dramatically outpaced by the growth of their revenue, and (2) most of their losses are due to acquisitions (and they are smart acquisitions). So overall this is a pretty strong portfolio and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a completely reasonable bet they&#x27;re going to be significantly profitable soon.<p>Now. Serious question: did you read this article? If yes you should be embarrassed at your misapprehension here, because in spite of the title, this data in this article actually paints a pretty damn rosy picture of Twitter&#x27;s future. If no, then <i>why are you commenting here</i>? Here I am sounding cranky, but if you&#x27;re going to do the ALL INTERNET SHOUTING CAPS thing then you&#x27;d better take care not to say something silly. Just my personal opinion, but next time I&#x27;d start by both reading the article <i>and</i> understanding the article, and I&#x27;d follow that up with taking care to make it sound like I don&#x27;t think that everyone who disagrees with me is, blanket statement, stupid.

Two extremely commonly held and mistaken beliefs.<p>Allow me to properly word it: market carve-ups, that cause consumer harm, and that the government chooses to prosecute and in which the government manages to prove consumer harm - are a violation of anti-trust laws.<p>If three companies carve up a market, benefit consumers, and the government chooses not to pursue - that is not a violation of anti-trust laws in any way shape or form. To make this point clearly, if the DOJ chose not to pursue Apple with anti-trust law regarding the ebook situation, what Apple did would not be considered a violation of anti-trust laws.

Now you can use it without remembering the implementation details, and it’s much clearer than the 10 lines that necessary to get the bounds and the fors to iterate over the matrix.<p>An extreme example is the GMP bignum library. You use each function as magic, and never read the implementation details. (Unless it’s in a very tight loop in a very hot part of the most important feature of your program, but I doubt that it’s good to use GMP in that place.)",1391648169

And I realize games are the big commercial driver of this stuff, so if they don&#x27;t care, we won&#x27;t get the &quot;nVidia of audio&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not primarily interested in games myself, though, but in computer-music software, interactive audio installations, livecoding, real-time algorithm and data sonification, etc. And for those use cases I think the fastest way forward really just is: 1) a raw audio API; and 2) fast JS engines. Some kind of audio shader language would be even better perhaps, but not strictly necessary, and I&#x27;d rather not wait forever for it. I mean to be honest I&#x27;d be happy if I could do on the web platform today what I could do in 2000 in C, which is not that demanding a level of performance.

Also, people work with raw canvas image arrays much more rarely than they do the high level functions (stroke/fill/etc)<p>OpenGL was still a better API than a raw framebuffer even when it was just a fixed function pipeline. Minecraft for example is implemented purely with fixed-function stuff, no shaders. It isn&#x27;t going to work if done via JS rasterization.<p>Yes, there are people on the edge cases doing procedural music, but that is a rare use case compared to the more general case of people writing games and needing audio with attenuation, 3D positional HRTF, doppler effects, etc.  That&#x27;s the sweet spot that the majority of developers need. Today&#x27;s 3D hardware includes features like geometry shaders/tessellation, but most games don&#x27;t use them.<p>OpenSL/AL would work a lot better if it had &quot;audio shaders&quot;. Yes. But if your argument is that you want to write a custom DSP, then you don&#x27;t want Data Audio API, what you want is some form of OpenAL++ that exposes an architecture neutral shader language for audio DSPs, that actually compiles your shader and uploads it to the DSP.  Or, you want OpenCL plus a pathway to schedule running the shaders and copying the data to the HW that does not involve the browser event loop.<p>That said, if there was a compelling need for the stuff you&#x27;re asking for, it would have been done years ago. None of the professional apps, nor game developers, have been begging for Microsoft Direct Sound, Apple, or Khronos to make audio shaders. There was a company not to long ago, Aureal 3D, which tried to be the &quot;3dfx of audio&quot;, but failed, but it turns out, most people just need a set of basic sound primitives they can change together.<p>I have real sympathy for your use case. For years, I dreamed of sounds being generated in games ala PhysX, really simulating sound waves in the environment, and calculating true binaural audio, the way Oculus Rift wants to deliver video to your senses, taking into account head position. To literally duplicate the quality of binaural audio recordings programmatically.<p>But we&#x27;re not there, the industry seems to have let us down, there is no SGI, nor 3dfx, nor Nvidia/AMD &quot;of audio&quot; to lead the way, and we certainly aren&#x27;t going to get there by dumping a frame buffer from JS.<p>Right now, the target for all this stuff, Web GL, Web Audio, et al, it exposing APIs to bring high performance, low latency games to the web.

It&#x27;s great that canvas exists, and it&#x27;s much more widely used than WebGL is, because it&#x27;s more flexible and depends on less legacy cruft. You don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to use it, but I do, and I&#x27;d like a &quot;canvas for audio&quot; too.<p>To make matters worse, the Web Audio stuff is much less flexible than OpenGL. You can at least write more or less arbitrary graphics code in OpenGL: it&#x27;s not just an API for playing movie clips filtered through a set of predefined MovieFilter nodes. You can generate textures procedurally, program shaders, render arbitrary meshes with arbitrary lighting, do all kinds of stuff. If this were still the era of the fixed-function OpenGL 1.0 pipeline, it&#x27;d be another story, but today&#x27;s OpenGL at least is a plausible candidate for a fully general programmable graphics pipeline.<p>Web Audio seems targeted more at just being an audio player with a fixed chain of filter/effect nodes, not a fully programmable audio pipeline. How are you going to do real procedural music on the web, something more like what you can do in Puredata or SuperCollider or even Processing, without being able to write to something resembling an audio sink? Apple cares about stuff like Logic Express, yes, but that isn&#x27;t a programmable synth or capable of procedural music; while I care about is the web becoming a usable procedural-music platform. One alternative is to do DSP in JS; another is to require you to write DSP code in a domain-specific language, like how you hand off shaders to WebGL. But Web Audio does the first badly and the 2nd not at all!<p>> Audio is a solved problem outside JS<p>Yeah, and the way it&#x27;s solved is that outside JS, you can just write a synth that outputs to the soundcard...",1391645484

If you get some unwarranted low ratings it&#x27;s helpful to know that all you need to do is release a point release to push them behind the All Versions tab that few ever touch. Unfortunately this also gives incentive to postpone updates if the current reviews are good to avoid hiding those. And, of course, the way it works is easily abused.<p>Every review system can be gamed, but I think the best possible compromise is how Amazon reviews work. Being able to comment on a review can at least help mitigate bad reviews without requiring moderation labor on Apple&#x27;s part. I personally always read the comments on Amazon reviews when doing product research.<p>As for prompting for ratings, I absolutely loathe those panels. I believe the request could be done more tastefully and inline with the actual content of the app without blocking everything with a modal alert.

Sure we had some test data, but a change this big was always going to be a huge leap of faith. So we needed to get it out to confirm previous findings before worrying too much about conversions.<p>On that note, the risk wasn&#x27;t just a different format but everything that goes with real-time communications. Not just web sockets or whatever tech, but a real-time human marketplace. The previous format afforded us a lot of luxuries with regard to resource planning and &quot;load balancing&quot;. Now with real-time, it&#x27;s quite tricky. I suspect this is a challenge for Uber too.",1391644895

7187753,comment,7184912,7187255,3,0,caitp,,,"FB React is a good example because it&#x27;s living more in the presentation layer. But Custom Elements offer some things that React doesn&#x27;t (as far as I&#x27;m aware).<p>One is better encapsulation, another is a well defined styling system (although obviously this article shows that this is not a super simple problem to solve, I&#x27;m certain that a good way of doing this will be around before too long) --- finally, and the most important thing, is that it&#x27;s just baked into the platform itself, so interop between different frameworks is less of a pain.<p>For instance, suppose you want to use a particular Ember component in your Angular app. You probably don&#x27;t want to include the entire Ember environment, and you want it to play nicely with Angular&#x27;s idea of data binding and local scopes. Can you even do this? If you can, how much effort does it take, and how much does it degrade the application?<p>So, we&#x27;ve got: interoperable components/widgets. Easily style-able widgets. Elements with some semantic purpose. Simplified documents. Reusable templates (which, once HTML imports are pref&#x27;d on by default, should be easily host-able on CDN hosts).<p>There are a lot of benefits to baking this into the platform, despite making the platform an even bigger, crazier mess than it already is. It should hopefully give us  better (and better designed) tools to work with.<p>Granted, I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s going to solve every (web) problem ever, nothing ever does.",1391644829

But at the same time it <i>does</i> provide an additional layer of security, and that layer can be useful.<p>The Docker people have a good post[1] about the Docker security model, and they list two future improvements they see as important:<p>&quot;map the root user of a container to a non-root user of the Docker host, to mitigate the effects of a container-to-host privilege escalation;&quot;<p>and<p>&quot;allow the Docker daemon to run without root privileges, and delegate operations requiring those privileges to well-audited sub-processes, each with its own (very limited) scope: virtual network setup, filesystem management, etc.&quot;<p>I think most people would agree these are important goal.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.docker.io/2013/08/containers-docker-how-secure-are-they/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.docker.io/2013/08/containers-docker-how-secure-a...</a>",1391644813

The only exception is the advice to use known and established licenses.<p>Ask instead yourself under what conditions you would accept having your code used. Is it acceptable if a commercial company take the software, say Google or apple, using it in products and do major secret modifications and changes without contributing anything back? If no, AGPL is the license of choice.<p>If you are acceptable of that, do you want direct distributors of the software to contribute secret modifications? If no, use GPL.<p>Do you want companies to be able to take your code, distribute it and then try and take you out with patents? If no, use apache.<p>Else: MIT/BSD. For-profit companies prefer the lower end of the list because it gives them the most options in order to create revenue. As such, you might get more users if you can live with the consequences. In the end, only you can answer what you want the license to say.",1391644810

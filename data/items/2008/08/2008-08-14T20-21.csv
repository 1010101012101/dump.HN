Is it what you would come up with if you were designing an ISA from scratch, but it's hardly rocket science either.<p>More to the point: the real determining factor for ""CPU uberness"" isn't the ISA at all, it's the process technologies.  Modern x86 CPUs aren't exactly handicapped; in fact they're pretty much the best parts you can buy in almost all major market areas.  Other architectures at this point are increasingly niche parts: very low power (the ARM family, although Intel is moving into this market as we speak), or very high parallelism (Sun's Niagra, IBM's Cell), etc...  If any of the stuff you're complaining about really mattered, it ought to be a competitive advantage to someone, no?  But it's verifiably not.",1218747567

276471,comment,276249,276459,0,0,orib,,,"<i>Edit: Some people seem to have missed my point; in summary: x86 is ugly (and below is why I think so) but we don't care because compilers enable us to just forget about what ISA we're using. This is a good thing. This is the way it should be. But it's also an example of what the OP was talking about -- bad hardware design (in this case the x86 ISA; the actual hardware is quite good) not mattering because software is sufficiently good</i><p>Sure. Some of these I'm not 100% sure of, so I hope I don't make myself look too stupid (sorry, don't have access to the docs right now) but here goes:<p><pre><code>  - Too few registers
       Mostly fixed in x86_64, but still an issue if you 
       want to support 99% of the machines out there still 
       on 32 bits

  - Overlapping register classes
       This makes the register allocator's job much more
       difficult, since not only do registers interfere with
       other registers which hold the same mode of varible,
       they sometimes -- but not always -- interfere with
       other registers of the same class.

  - Irregular instructions
       If you use some registers, they're encoded
       in less bytes than others, so the optimizer/allocator
       has yet another parameter to take into account.

  - Fixed registers for integer multiplication/division
       You're forced to clobber %eax/%edx and one other reg of
       your choice. This causes more spills than it should,
       and makes the job of the register allocator harder.

  - Way too many jump variants
       I think I counted 63 variants of the instructions,
       and you can encode the same one multiple times, which
       gives you hundreds of ways of encoding a jump.

  - Complicated encoding
       First, it's a variable length encoding. You can have
       one, two, or 3 byte instruction opcodes, with various
       prefixes and suffixes.

  - Ambiguity in some cases
       Instructions can sometimes take the same initial byte
       sequences as a prefix, despite not actually having
       that prefix switched on; when decoding you have to
       figure out the rest of the instruction before you
       decide if you've got a prefix.

  - Useless Instructions (minor annoyance)
       x86 has lots (and lots) of instructions that are
       unused by compilers, are slower than simply doing
       the smaller instructions that they are composed of,
       but are still around for compatibility. Sure, it's
       needed, but do I have to like it?
</code></pre>
Really, x86 implementations these days are quite good, but the instruction set is not pretty. x86 has more cruft than most other architectures out there. It's certainly not impossible to write a good compiler for it, it's just a whole lot harder, especially when it comes to doing register allocation. (x86 isn't even too painful to write by hand!)",1218747128

What do you do?” And I’ll say, “Oh, I’m writing a book.” They say, “OK, what’s it about?” Da da da da da. Bump into them three times and they’ll say, “Hey if you want you can send me a copy of your book.” This absolutely works very, very well.

Yeah thanks.”<p>""So you use marketing to acquire customers, and product to keep customers. You need to use those two in tandem. You need to learn how to sell around your product.

276441,comment,275973,276224,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Philip Greenspun might be a good subject of an afternoon of reading for you.  He went from academia to startup and back to academia.  He's been pretty successful in both fields.<p>Randy Pausch, of ""The Last Lecture"" fame, talked about the subject in that lecture.  Though he was coming at it from a slightly different perspective: become an Imagineer, which was a lifelong dream, or go back to teaching...he chose teaching.  Working for Disney is not quite the same as starting a startup, though I imagine for some folks it would be the same kind of personal satisfaction...that of building something real.<p>I don't know that they've ever answered specifically why they made the decisions they made, but it couldn't hurt to get a feel for their thoughts.<p>Two other quick points, before I become a preachy bore:<p>1. If you're getting success in academia, you will probably also be able to get success in other fields, if you apply the same passion and excitement.  The question shouldn't be ""what will make me most successful?"", it should be ""what will make me most satisfied with my life?""  As you get older, you'll recognize this more and more clearly...better to spot the trend early.  Success will usually follow.<p>2. Academia, at least in technical fields, does not generally frown on success in the ""real world"".  Success in business can be as good for your academic career as the papers you would have written and the research you would have done during that time.  Again, follow your satisfaction and your excitement.<p>3. (I know I said 2...I discovered this one just now.) You will never be in a better position to take risks than you are now.  As you age you collect responsibilities: Family, kids, parents needing care, mortgage payments, etc.  These responsibilities are the things you can't risk to pursue your dreams...so, when you're older, you can't put as much in the game.  You can still start a startup, or change careers, at any age, and experience certainly has benefits, but when it comes to risk, younger is better.  Without family and kids, the risk is practically nil.",1218744731

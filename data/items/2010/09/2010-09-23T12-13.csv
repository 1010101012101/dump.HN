Cluttered is the last thing I would call it.<p>Sure, they could display less. Ten rows, two columns – that sounds to me like they picked a nice round number without much thought.

I haven't met any .Net developers who work on open source .Net projects. They work on projects in C or Python on their own but almost never C#. The C# open source projects that I've used in the past like Lucene .Net are just straight ports from Java. Lucene is a little frustrating because it doesn't take advantage of many C# features so it feels like programming Java when you're interacting with it.",1285246494

It's really a symptom of .Net and Microsoft locking in the vast majority of inexperienced users with overly abstract components.<p>Developers fresh out of college who were taught .Net in school and get a job in it become experts at Partial PostBacks and Code Behinds and binding data to the latest whiz-bang GridDataAwesomeControlForTheWin.<p>The problem I've seen time and again is that they have no idea how this is implemented.  Ask a green .Net developer about the ViewState lifecycle and see if they know how that really works.<p>I don't mean to disparage all .Net developers or to try and say that being a .Net developer precludes you from ever understanding how these things work.  I am trying to say that for a lot of people for whom coding is their 9-5 way to make money, they will never look behind that curtain to better understand their craft.  They will believe that Microsoft invented Model View Controller, they will only get exposed to technology at the pace Microsoft cares to expose them to it, and that's a shame.<p>There are probably a lot of 9-5ers who could have that switch flipped and go from code monkey to craftsmen, but they are stuck doing WebForms and have never really got bitten by the curiosity bug in the face of the stale joyless Microsoft platform.<p>Other platforms can be just as dangerous, even RoR has a preponderance of gems that solve common problems in web development that there are probably RoR web devs that have never thought about have you would implement authentication on the web, just slap :acts_as_authenticator_unicorns_rule on the model.

1719417,comment,1719277,1719277,0,0,acabal,,,"A sizeable chunk of .NET development happens in the corporate/enterprise world.  That sort of environment isn't interested in collaboration, open source, etc.--they're interested in the guaranteed support the MS stack provides, and the idiot-proof web basics provided by ASP/webforms/MVC.<p>If shit hits the fan in the .NET stack for a big enough corporate project, someone in the office can phone/email MS and get support for their problem.  If a bug is found in the stack itself, it won't languish unsolved in bug trackers for years, like many OSS bugs do.  MS will probably fix it in their next cycle, and the corporate devs won't have to waste their time figuring out the nuts and bolts of the stack to fix the bugs themselves, like in OSS.<p>So I think it's this requirement for enterprise support that keeps MS from accepting OSS patches and locking everyone in--it would be too much work to track, validate, and test 3rd party patches when they can just fix it themselves with their own devs and keep going to sleep on their piles of money surrounded by many beautiful women.<p>Unfortunately this sort of view isn't very compatible with the indie developer ideal, or the ideals the author holds--which might one of the many reasons why you see so much Rails/PHP development in the non-enterprise space.",1285246327

Google's revenue for 2008 and 2009 is 21.8bil, 23.6bil and looks on track to be just over 24bil for this year. Their exponential growth curve is over, it ended in 2006 but nobody was paying attention because their growth percentages were still really good.<p>I'm still not sold on FB using Adverts to grow to Google sizes. I just don't see it. Their friend suggests are terrible, I don't think they've suggested anybody I actually know ever, I can't imagine how bad targeted adverts will be. Plus they have a miserable privacy record. On top of that, FB isn't really used in the same way Google is.

That is the one and only thing they hear louder than their big-business supporters.<p>Unemploying every single member of both houses up for reelection would send a strong message to both the newly unemployed as well as the new members that the voters have woken up to the fact that they are no longer representing us, the voters, but are in fact representing the special interests of big business.  And it would firmly point out to them that it is us, the voters, who truly control their destiny, not big business, and that they better start listening to us.<p>And that is why, come November, my choice of who to vote for is easy.  If you are an incumbent, you will be voted against.",1285243485

When they switched to DVDs, I'd say most of the time if the movie wasn't brand new, it would be unwatchable.  I'd have to get up off the couch and go exchange it for another that might work.<p>I don't watch many movies and when I do, usually it's a borred DVD or I'll catch it on HBO or my cable provider's on-demand service.

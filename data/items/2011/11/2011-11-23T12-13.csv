You are right in the fact that it doesn't cost you anything (or much) to learn to code, but what we would argue is what is the most effective way to learn? We started out down this path 18 months ago. We exhausted all the books, tutorials, screencasts, and workshops you could find, and while we learned a lot, we still weren't where we wanted to be.<p>If we decided to keep fighting through I am sure we would have gotten to a proficient level, but we just stopped and wondered, ""why isn't there a better way to do this?""

3269836,comment,3265601,3265601,1,0,andrewingram,,,"Speaking from my own own experiences, I wouldn't class depression as a disease, but as a disorder (wikipedia seems to agree).<p>I would describe it as having a heavy inertia towards negative thoughts and feelings of hopelessness. It's totally possible to have moments of happiness, be cheerful etc, but these moments are fleeting because they take such considerable effort to maintain. It's even more effort to force yourself into a good mood, and part of the problem is that you don't actually want to.<p>Whilst I'm skeptical about the efficacy of anti-depressants, I would say the effect I've (subjectively) noticed is to decrease this inertia to the extent that it's easier to have good moments. They don't actually make you happier, they just make it easier for other methods to work, eg CBT or Meditation.<p>With regards to startup depression. I'd be very surprised if it's something that affects everyone, but there are certainly people who aren't currently depressed whom have character traits that would trigger depression in a startup environment. These people are typically over-invested in outcomes, or tie their ego up with their successes.<p>My advice to anyone considering joining a startup would be to honestly assess themselves and work out whether they have some of the traits that would put them at risk of depression. Then tackle them before getting involved, almost all the lessons I've learned from books and therapists are applicable in some way to everyone, not just those with depression.",1322052269

They know becoming a software developer is not in their future, but they want to understand the software development process and be able to communicate in as much technical detail as possible to work with their developers.

I graduated from Northwestern, so I understand the urge to want to pile on and see if I can take both classes, but this class is pretty intense, especially for people who are new to programming.

I've done this before, and I don't think it's any less clear  -- I wouldn't have thought of making a public announcement about it, though. I like it because it more closely aligns with the way you're probably thinking in this example: you're wondering if <i>current_day</i> is part of a certain set of days (the discount weekdays, apparently), not if it's equal to ""Monday"" or equal to ""Tuesday"", etc. I like the Javascript example with it's <i>indexOf(..) >= 0</i> a lot less, but I guess people more used to JS idioms auto-translate this sequence to a set-contains operation.<p>It's more sensible if the set of values is larger than just three; and in this instance, you have to wonder why the day isn't available as a numeric variable, but I think you can let it slide for a contrived example.<p>It's even more useful if you reference the same set more than once, because you can just define it once, and as a constant if your language of choice does that kind of thing. This would also let you make your code less wordy (but arguably more literal) without hiding logic in functions, e.g. his later example would be<p><pre><code>  if(discount_weekdays.include?(current_day) && current_date > 20)</code></pre>",1322050827

One very interesting feature of GA144 is that all 144 cores can share instructions over I/O lines. That means every core can send instructions to their neighbors who execute them directly without conversion.<p>I/O ist fast enough. I guess it should be possible to have (someday) an external interface to SRAM which circumvents the low memory problem.<p>> They offer no compiler from high-level language like C.<p>That's right, and that's the real weak spot of GA144. Almost every microcontroller board today comes with C or alike. Mr. Moore loves Forth but I doubt that there are many developers out there who like to be forced to learn Forth just for this single platform. I know Forth, it was one of my first languages I ever learned. It is perfectly suitable for embedded systems but you have to learn a lot to master it.",1322050293

To avoid giving this impression too strongly, it's quite likely they have a fair degree of autonomy over copyright enforcement policy. After all, the whole reason the BSA exists is to keep its harassment of small businesses at arm's length from its members.<p>That being the case, it's not entirely surprising that the BSA would support anything that appears to make copyright enforcement easier for them. Nor is it particularly surprising that some of its members would find SOPA in conflict with their other interests and request that the BSA adopt a more nuanced position.<p>I guess that's just not as much fun as some of the other conspiracy theories I see in this thread.",1322050040

That method returns different values given the same inputs; it's not a good candidate for being memoized.<p>(Furthermore, it's harder to test, as now <i>current_date</i> and <i>current_day</i> need to be stubbed out.

The Internet is the biggest equalizer in world history. Everyone can say anything to anyone who has an Internet connection. Billions of people directly connected to each other.<p>And what has happened? Yes, everyone can reach everyone, and everyone is equal, _in principle_. But the removal of competitive barriers makes the winner-take-all effect (""power-law"") is stronger than it has been in _any_ context, ever. As robotics becomes more prevalent, this will happen in the physical world as well. The income disparity between the richest and the average will become a lot larger.<p>I am not sure that this in itself is a problem, though. But it is essential that we are able to develop the political and social innovations required to ensure that _power_ doesn't go along with money.

Some examples:<p>* Using JS to load the next page for instance.  That should be a simple request to the server for a /page2/.<p>* Using JS to change sort orders.  Again a simple request for a new page should be made to the server.<p>* Pages not loading a full list in one go but making several requests for more entries via JS.  The server should just return one long page.<p>* Searches not being sent to the server but using the browser to search which does a new search for every character.<p>* The same searches above hijacking the back button so that I can go back one key from round -> roun -> rou -> ro ->r -> no search -> at last, back one page!<p>* Images being hidden behind a javascript link when it should be a simple hyperlink to the image.<p>As for every website writing their own native software, at least some that I can think of could be substituted for old ones.

But if you have staff here, and you sell services here to people here, then you should probably pay some tax on those earnings here.<p>Google might be able to ride out the storm - there's not very many Google stores for vandals to deface.

4915347,comment,4905684,4911547,4,0,dalke,,,"I object to the statement ""our behaviors are shaped in ways that increase our fitness follows necessarily from the theory of evolution.""<p>That is a individual-centered view of evolution. But evolution works on genes, not individuals. Had you said ""our behaviors are shaped in ways that increase the fitness of our genes"" then I would have agreed.<p>In your second paragraph, you said ""Also, there are multiple levels when considering optimal behavior.""<p>I disagree. There is only one level - that of the genes. If you're a Tasmanian devil and part of you mutates to produce the cancer which is devil facial tumor disease, and that cancer spreads to all of the other Tasmanian devils, and kills off the species, then evolution doesn't care. That set of genes managed to transcend the individual and survive without it. (Which is a good thing since it kills its host.)<p>Elsewhere in this thread I gave a model where two independent mutations occur at effectively the same time in the same person. One is a big advantage, the other a minor disadvantage. Both together still convey a big evolutionary advantage. This means that the minor disadvantage is very likely to spread into the entire population, because it's part of the same genome as the big advantage.<p>We see this all the time. As a trivial example, about 8% of our genome is made up of endogenous retroviruses. These are viruses which incorporated themselves into our DNA, and then a host mutation killed them off. They are no longer do anything for us. But our body spends a slight amount of energy transcribing them. No advantage plus slight disadvantage => net negative. Still, the evolutionary pressure to remove those bits of dead retroviruses is so weak that they have persisted for millions of years. We share some of that DNA with chimpanzees, for example.<p>There was likely never a time when those genes gave any advantage to an individual or even were net neutral, which is why I object to the statement ""behaviors that are detrimental get weeded out.""<p>Your statement assumes an infinite amount of time in a stable background - but species live for only a few million years (on average) and the background is always changing, so your statement isn't useful.",1355399220

If you are a Norwegian citizen and somehow unable to make a living (low skills, illness), the government will pay you a small but sufficient amount of money. This is what we will eventually need to institute across the whole world - tax the richest and use the proceeds to give a ""guaranteed salary"" to everyone.

Even ones that the tech press or hackers don't care about. Shutterfly pulls in hundreds of millions dollars a year, mostly from paper products related to uploaded photos. Like photos for your kids' softball team.<p>Flickr can't be the next Flickr, because when Flickr was Flickr it was the <i>only</i> app of its kind. People really were doing a lot of different activities on the site; photos were the media object to organize it around. Back in 2005, it was  Twitter, Facebook, LiveStream, Tumblr, YouTube, etc., all in one. Whatever Flickr is going forward, it will probably be more narrow and more deep. I'm not sure they can win as an all-things-to-all-people photos site.",1355396552

Once the calculation is done I need to test if the possible growth can be handled. If I can not handle the growth I would check how much new hardware I would need and buy and install those. The rest of the money would be used in adwords for new possible clients to create more revenue.<p>I would not have used the money to get new computer or hired virtual assistent, because I see that as a waste of money. Then again I would not even bought that VPS as I would have one or two dedicated servers anyway.",1355396548

This is hacker news so I wonder how this sentiment belongs here.<p>Nevertheless, there is a conceptual barrier here that is difficult to cross, and it has to do with the expectation here that a gadget or product should hold our attention, or in other words, to be a distraction, in order to be worth our time and money. The light however is not exactly the same sort of thing as a game console- it's aiming for a different kind of niche, the niche of ambient computing. A kind of gadget that you /don't/ notice, that doesn't hold your attention. A gadget you buy expecting to forget that it is there- because it is just quietly doing what it is supposed to: ambiently communicating. A mood, a temperature, a status. It's simple as that. As geeks we can hack on it and overcomplicate things, but the essence of this is simply: connect a light to the cloud.",1355396514

Most tech savvy users have adblock and won't see the ads resulting in poor conversion rates.<p>For 20,000, I would spend it on a designer to make your product look great if you already have an MVP. If not, you should be working on getting an MVP and not worry about ads just yet.<p>An easy way for market validation would be to use a sign up page like launchrock and put in a elevator pitch. Ask friends to share on FB/Twitter and see the response.",1355396491

I don't know how they managed to put the airport where _it used to be 25 years ago_, for instance. It can't find one of the biggest swimming halls outside of town, and last time I needed driving directions it put me on the wrong side of a roadblock, whereas Google Maps routed me the correct way (running on an old iOS device).",1355396471

After I found out that I couldn't do this on my mac, I fired up Parallels to give it a shot.  Then install of the video player on Windows took many steps including upgrading my systems DRM.  After that it went ahead and tried to download the 2 gb+ movie to it's default location under C:\Documents and Settings\... without ever asking me if I wanted it there or not.  My C drive on my parallels system doesn't have enough space, so the download failed.  I found in preferences where I could switch it to another drive so I tried to switch it to my mapped drive on my mac, and it wouldn't let me since it ""wasn't a local drive"".  Now maybe I've been away from Windows for too long, but I thought this was ridiculous.  I'm used  to developing on the mac and cloning my development environment by mounting drives and having those available to me as if they were part of my local system.  Why does this software care if it was a local drive or not?  So I had to pick another ""local"" drive that I created in Windows and everything seemed okay.  I then found it impossible to download that original file.  It still said not enough disk space and I determined that the file was still trying to point to it's original location.  I probably could of figured out where that was stored behind the scenes and fixed it, but I was getting frustrated and wanted to watch the movie.  I deleted it and it warned me that I'll have to rent it again.  I was mad, but considered that my easiest solution.  I rented it again and nothing happened.  I was charged for another rental, but when I went online it said that I'd already downloaded the file.  WTF?  <p>I know that Amazon may be handicapped by what it can do on this platform (system based DRM and such), but my question is: why not develop these applications first on another platform (mac or linux) and get it done right first with a group of users that really want access to this type of service, then port it to windows with a precedence of how it should work?  Also, I don't understand how if I have problems with this, the average user is going to make it work.  Have my standard just been raised in the past year or so using non-windows environments causing my frustration levels to increase when I run into problems with this, or is this just another poor user experience due to lack of effort by the software developers?<p>\n",1190382459

The prospects of a startup with the possiblity of high equity yield over a short period of time being a good investment increase with the competence of the original founders.

57927,comment,57868,57887,0,0,Goladus,,,"I think it's sort of presumed by the article, but there are a few things people worry about when they hear ""significant whitespace""<p>-They remember pain of trying to find an error in a code, data, or config file that had significant whitespace.  Consider the 'tab-delimited' spreadsheet format, for example.  If you manually edit a tab-delimited list of numbers, and accidentally leave a space somewhere, the number might be read as a string. <p>-They've spent a lot of time dealing with HTML rendering, where whitespace gets mangled and cannot be trusted.<p>-They're afraid they won't be able to make their code readable.<p>-They're afraid that the whitespace rules will be complicated, requiring them to think constantly while adjusting to this newfangled way to delimit blocks.

ID based science will be the next revolution.>><p>If you believe in God, then doesn't 'figuring out what God is up to' simply mean 'science.'  In that case, what does it mean for science to to be 'ID based' ?  That your research pursuits are guided by the bible?  If so, why don't you just go work in a lab somewhere?\n",1190380795

719519,comment,717982,717982,0,0,bpyne,,,"There's another more fundamental issue with education at the high school level in the US: scheduling. Usually high school students go through 6 periods of 50 minutes each daily, often with one of them being a study period alternating with physical education.<p>Putting the students truly curious about math, who usually make up a small percent of the students in the college bound math classes, and aligning them with a teacher capable of keeping them engaged is possible. The problem lies in having them attend their other subjects at a level appropriate to them. Keep in mind that each member of this subset of students may not be at the same level as their peers in other subjects.<p>If these curious math students are not segregated out, which  often happens, then a teacher has 20-30 good math students with a few being curious enough to be elite. Keeping the two distinct groups of that class engaged requires distinct lesson plans for each group. The goals of each day's lesson plan need to be met within no more than a 40 minute window - I'm being generous that taking attendance and assigning home work take up no more than 10 minutes of class time.<p>I admit it's a worthwhile goal to have the curious math students more engaged. However, I don't see it being possible unless a more fundamental restructuring of high school education occurs. Perhaps have it structured more like a university schedule in which students take 3 subjects daily with each class being 1-1.5 hours.",1248357369

Is it that their contribution is worth so much more to society? Doubtful. More, perhaps, that much more, unlikely.<p>For example in the article the guys earning 30million a year (10% of their gambling wins) are only able to earn large amounts because they're on a buoyant market. It's largely random fluctuations - they win for 15 years and then lose it all (except they don't personally lose of course); others win for 15 days and lose it all.<p>So, the guys paying the most tax, the investment managers &c. are adding little to overall productivity (except some lubrication which could be provided without the ineffecient losses of traders wages) but are creaming off inordinant amounts of wealth from the top all the time simply because of a mathematical glitch -- if you waited 100 years and analysed the gains of any investment firm I'll guess they do marginally better then inflation but extract far more worth for the traders.<p>Those doing productive work, even the highly paid Harvard professors are earning pennies compared to the investment teams.<p>So are the investment managers pulling their weight in society by creaming off the wealth by gambling with other peoples money? I don't think so.<p>Capitalism means the rich get richer, some clever people manage to use other peoples money to be rich first. The rest of us are being suckered.",1248354928

Now the nice thing is, 6 months later you can set another 12 months goal and will have again, one 6 month goal and one 12 month goal.

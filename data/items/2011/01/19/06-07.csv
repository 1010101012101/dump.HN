Get you to something thats releasable (MVP) and allows you to test your assumptions.  If you read a lot of the articles on HN you will see a lot are about how fast and cheap can you run experiments on your assumptions and execution. I think you are thinking in the opposite of what you need to be in saying, ""I want to do it right, not necessarily quickly"".  So yeah my advice is .. if you know Java do Java, if you can pick up PHP fast, do it.  Whatever makes sense and can get you a working prototype that clearly shows your vision.",1295420261

The wording of the original yc comment framed the question in terms of whether wars are good or bad or what constituted a war, etc., and that's how we followed, but all the author claims is that wars=inflation and that good dow years follow inflationary spikes.<p>I would imagine that the only reason why someone would posit this correlation would be to say something on how to view our current situation, and I think he's saying that we've had a bad 10 years (logarithmicly speaking), but once we're out of this war (by him, inflationary) period, things will be great.<p>I'm not sure if I buy this argument or its implications, but the omission of korea, panama, gulf war 1 and somalia and the inclusion of the GWoT don't ""ruin"" it for me, at very least.",1295419576

2118939,comment,2118460,2118637,0,0,Homunculiheaded,,,"I work in academia, and have also worked in private industry.  One of the largest problems with academia is that there is no easily quantifiable metric of success.  In the private world a good indicator that you're doing something right is that you're making money.  In state schools this is complicated further because budgets are based on something entirely independent of performance.  For example the state school I work at has the highest enrollment ever, and our 6 year graduation rate is up, but this is going to be the worst year yet for budgets in a while.  There simply exists no reward/punishment system that encourages good behavior and discourages bad. Even tenure works the opposite of its intended effect: the value of life long job security is inversely proportional to how valuable you think your skills are to other people (if you're top in the world any org you work for should be begging to keep you, if you think you're the bottom of the barrel you'll fight tooth and nail to earn virtually permanent employment). The only exception to this is research, where grants can serve as a good reward system, unfortunately this only creates a further imbalance in that research is rewarded but teaching is not.<p>In short incentives in higher ed are random, if not flat out reversed. The only motivator for good educators is personal passion.",1295419141

Back then, you had to have a PhD because the building blocks of the internet, and microcomputing were still being developed.  Since then, the amount of people who actually know how the internet works (or have a PC in the house) has exploded.  A simple comparison of graduates in technology from the 70's to now would tell the story.  The older generation didn't grow up with this stuff in their houses and schools (at least my parents didn't).  As time passes, that will not be the case.

After that I learned some python, and some C, although my main workhorse is R and I've mostly worked in the other languages to write more efficient R programs. My interests include a good bit of applied stats work on the side of my normal, mostly unrelated, job.<p>Every time there is a YC app due, a few friends and I brainstorm about ideas. Ya, ya, I know ideas are cheap, but working tirelessly building something is one hell of a dream/nightmare, and you better be pretty sure you believe in the idea. But none of them have ever been that good, even though we applied once.  Today though, for the first time, I came up with an idea that really struck me. Its the first idea I've had that I could explain to completely random non-technical friends and have them say 1) I get that 2) I'd use it and 3) I'd invest.<p>And then I realize, crap, I want to do this more than I've wanted to do anything in a long time. If I had any money I'd quit my job today, but barring that I'm going to make as good a prototype by March 20th as is possible. So my question is pretty simple: what next? Lets assume for a moment that I can program in some computation is beautiful and has always clicked for me, and I own a copy of and have implemented things from CLRS way, but that until about 12 hours ago I was always more fascinated with datasets sitting on my computer than web applications. I know I'm asking the impossible/ridiculous question, but lets assume I didn't sleep much for the next 60 days, what do I need to read? I assume I want to use LAMP (with python), what is a good introduction to MySQL? What libraries do I need to look at? Is Django the way to go? (I ask this because I want to do things right, not necessarily quickly, I'm skeptical of something like turbogears) Who is best for hosting Django projects since I need shell access, etc? I know partially I'm asking religious questions, and I also know that I will definitely ultimately relay on lots of guides/how-tos/instructions on everything, but HN seems like the perfect place to ask for that first push down the hill.",1295418199

I wrote the comment to mean ""that's inherent to the style of commenting Reddit chose, not Reddit per se"".

This will be what motivates you to spend that time alone pouring over new material, working through a hard problem. This will make you become a perfectionist if you aren't one because the perfect creations will be the best. I feel this is the most important skill to have because it enforces many other traits all at once.",1295417068

But I've just never found a use for CSS frameworks, SASS etc. (and I work on a relatively large public site).  CSS has just never been the bottleneck for me, and the few times I've wanted to use variables and other complications have usually been for ""clever"" hacks, nothing production quality IMO.<p>As for your second point, it really depends on the coupling.  If you are using a grid system, like I was talking about, it's pretty rare that you would ever want to restyle EVERY single 760px wide div (which just leads to more class layering and more of a headache).",1295416829

I was learning more about the Google Domains interface, and typed google.com and clicked search domains. To my surprise, Google.com was showing as available!<p>I clicked the add to cart icon beside the domain (which should not appear if the domain is not available for sale). The domain actually got added to my cart as seen by the green check-box, and the domain appeared in my cart.<p>I was hoping I would get an error at sometime saying transaction did not go through, but I was able to complete purchase, and my credit card was actually charged!<p>As soon as I completed purchase, I received two emails, one from sc-noreply@google.com, and one from wmt-noreply@google.com, which is not the norm when you book domains via Google Domains as I have booked new, previously un-registered domains before, and I have never received emails from the above aliases on booking the domains.  I will not share the contents of the emails here given they relate to the Google.com domain. The domain also successfully appeared in my Google Domains order history.<p>Additionally, my Google Search Console (aka Google Webmaster Tools) was auto-updated with webmaster related messages for the Google.com domain which actually means ownership was transferred to me! One gets the below messages in Search Console only for those domains for which one is the verified admin/verified owner (of course access was removed when domain was taken back by Google).<p>Additionally, I started receiving notifications, for when ownership changed (along with new owner details etc.) in the Google Search Console for websites (I will not name them) that are powered by Google Sites (which makes sense given that websites powered by Google Sites rest on the master domain Google.com). Quite clearly, ownership had been granted to me. Order was successful.<p>Though purchase had successfully gone through, and domain now belonged to me as evident above, the purchase was followed by an order cancellation email from Google Domains. Google could do this given the registration service used by me (aka Google Domains) belonged to Google, unlike the 2003 event in which Microsoft forgot to renew their Hotmail UK domain which was registered with Nominet UK. As a result, the Hotmail UK domain was returned to the open market for pickup by anybody who fancied it. Somebody else picked it up, and as Microsoft wasn&#x27;t the registrar themselves, Microsoft wasn&#x27;t able to cancel the order, and take it back automatically. In my case, I don&#x27;t know what caused Google to lose ownership of the domain Google.com as a result of which it was available in the open market.<p>The purchase got completed and the card was charged (which would not have happened unless I actually successfully completed checkout, as otherwise I would have received an error). The charge was not a pre-auth.<p>The order history page auto-updated itself with a new message (missed taking a screenshot when the canceled message was not appearing).<p>On searching again for the domain Google.com, it now finally shows as unavailable.<p>The Indian Prime Minister&#x27;s visit did work wonders...it ended up convincing Google to sell the most visited domain on the internet to a person from the Kutch region of the Indian Prime Minister&#x27;s home state...albeit just for a minute or so :)<p>-----<p>Note: I have reported the incident to Google Security. Google has reverted back, and has acknowledged the incident.<p>all your missing are some screenshots",1443667166

Granted, he has not been proven wrong yet.<p>It is interesting, perhaps even a little surprising, that reasoning about programs has proven to be one of the most intractable challenges for AI.  Why, to take a simple-sounding example, when my program does something wrong, can I not simply ask the machine why it did it?  Why do I have to go in with a debugger and find the problem myself?  This wouldn&#x27;t require solutions to any of the familiar bugaboos of AI: it doesn&#x27;t need a massive database of facts about the world, it doesn&#x27;t require visual image recognition, it doesn&#x27;t require natural language understanding, it doesn&#x27;t require robotics or simulated emotions or any of those things.  It just requires logical reasoning.  Can&#x27;t computers do that?<p>Well, no, it turns out, they can&#x27;t do it, not in its full generality.  Despite all the things it doesn&#x27;t require, general logical reasoning is still almost AI-complete, which is a cute way of saying we still don&#x27;t know how to make machines do it.<p>And fully general reasoning is required to solve the problem.  We have lots of static analysis algorithms that can answer specific kinds of questions about programs, but we&#x27;re still not very close to being able to answer an <i>arbitrary</i> question, even fairly simple ones.  The spaces we would have to search are just too big; the branching factors are too high.<p>I think there is hope on the horizon, though.  The so-called automated reasoning systems that have been built over the last few decades -- also called theorem provers -- have mostly not made use of any machine learning techniques.  These two technologies are starting to be combined, and machine learning is of course a very hot area right now.

Briefly, there is no contradiction between the existence of clusters and the notion that there is more variation within clusters than between clusters. For example, the variation in height <i>within</i> the categories &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot; is greater than the variation <i>between</i> them (i.e., the difference in mean heights), but this does not negate the validity of the clusters &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot;. Indeed, only a  small number of traits are needed to determine biological sex to high accuracyâ€”e.g., height, skeletal density, cranial volume, waist-to-hip ratio, etc.â€”even though in every individual case the variation within traits exceeds the variation between traits [1].<p>Likewise, simply because the variation within sub-Saharan Africans is greater than the variation between them and other groups doesn&#x27;t mean the cluster doesn&#x27;t exist [2]. Indeed, it&#x27;s easy to tell from a genetic analysis what percentage of a person&#x27;s ancestry comes from each cluster, including sub-Saharan Africa [3].<p>The study in the OP indicates that fingerprints are like DNA in this regard. That doesn&#x27;t mean the study is right, simply that it shouldn&#x27;t be rejected based on Lewontin&#x27;s Fallacy.<p>[1]: This is why anthropologists can reliably determine sex based even on fragmentary skeletons (such as &quot;Lucy&quot;).<p>[2]: The edges of the clusters are often fuzzy, but again this doesn&#x27;t negate their existence. The clusters &quot;red&quot; and &quot;green&quot; are fuzzy, too, but that doesn&#x27;t make the categories meaningless.<p>[3]: For example, this is the premise behind Henry Louis Gates Jr.&#x27;s PBS show &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; (<a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wnet/finding-your-roots/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wnet/finding-your-roots/</a>).

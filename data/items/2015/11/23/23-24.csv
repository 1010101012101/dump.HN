Callbacks (or async tasks/promises, observables, etc.) should not be called immediately when they are registered.  It makes it way too hard to figure out if your code is correct.<p>This doesn&#x27;t break the abstraction, but it does make the abstraction simpler.  It means that your callbacks (or whatever abstraction is built on top of them) are always called from the same context.",1448323199

Consider: if you want someone else to store your car, or your junk, or your data, you have to pay them. The only reason banks normally pay <i>you</i> instead is that your deposits are so useful (for making loans, and profit on those loans), that it&#x27;s worth it to pay you to convince you to put your money there. But if economic conditions are such that the bank can&#x27;t make any profit using your money, there&#x27;s no reason why they would pay you to keep it there.<p>You might ask, why on earth would I pay a negative interest rate on deposits if I can just keep my money under my mattress? And yes, you could do that, and some people will (or they&#x27;ll move to a different bank). But then you can&#x27;t pay with debit cards or use any of the other services provided by a bank, or benefit from its physical security.

How can we give business priority to those ideas?</i><p>The difference is that if you challenge someone to not just meet a minimal set of criteria to &quot;solve&quot; a bug/ticket/request, but to use their wits to go further and not just solve it, but solve it in a way that creatively improves things around it too, then they&#x27;ll be way more engaged. Almost all studies on this sort of thing have shown that you get higher quality work, people work <i>faster</i> in this set up, and they generally report feeling satisfied about it. This was a big part of the book Peopleware, where it talks about how in software at least, the notion that you have to trade-off speed of implementation against quality of implementation is a total myth -- just not borne out of any data measuring task completion time, degree of spec completeness, and bugs.<p>To me, things like Agile tend to get politicized in a company and then get misused, to the point where rote emphasis on minimally clearing tickets ruins any chance to let people be creative about <i>how</i> they solve maintenance issues.<p>And at the end of the day, even if you have great system architects, usually it is the maintenance developers who have really seen the nitty gritty of the codebase and have the most intuition about good refactoring design choices.",1448322641

Canonical says that you must rebuild the binaries, even if those binaries don&#x27;t contain any Canonical trademarks.<p>Red Hat merely requires that you remove the trademarks in the actual branding packages; they even explicitly state which packages those are, to make it very clear. From their trademark guidelines (<a href=""https://www.redhat.com/f/pdf/corp/RH-3573_284204_TM_Gd.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.redhat.com/f/pdf/corp/RH-3573_284204_TM_Gd.pdf</a>):<p><pre><code>  You must modify the files identified as REDHAT-LOGOS \n  and ANACONDA-IMAGES so as to remove all use of \n  images containing the “Red Hat” trademark or Red \n  Hat’s Shadowman logo. Note that mere deletion of \n  these files may corrupt the software.\n</code></pre>\nCanonical requires that you rebuild <i>every binary package</i> in the distro (or at least, they don&#x27;t qualify at all which binary packages have to be rebuilt when saying that you must rebuild binary packages). This is a far different, and much more onerous, requirement.<p><pre><code>  Any redistribution of modified versions of Ubuntu must be \n  approved, certified or provided by Canonical if you are going \n  to associate it with the Trademarks. Otherwise you must remove \n  and replace the Trademarks and will need to recompile the \n  source code to create your own binaries. This does not affect \n  your rights under any open source licence applicable to any of \n  the components of Ubuntu. If you need us to approve, certify \n  or provide modified versions for redistribution you will \n  require a licence agreement from Canonical, for which you may \n  be required to pay. For further information, please contact us \n  (as set out below).\n</code></pre>\nAny attempt to clarify with Canonical to determine whether they just mean rebuilding those packages that contain branding, or how this interacts with packages that are not covered by copyleft licenses (that forbid applying extra restrictions like this recompilation requirement), have been met with silence (at least publicly).<p>The Free Software Foundation and Software Freedom Conservancy have put out statements on this matter, criticizing Canonical for this vague policy:<p><a href=""https://www.fsf.org/news/canonical-updated-licensing-terms"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fsf.org/news/canonical-updated-licensing-terms</a>\n<a href=""https://sfconservancy.org/news/2015/jul/15/ubuntu-ip-policy/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sfconservancy.org/news/2015/jul/15/ubuntu-ip-policy/</a><p>Whether this requirement is actually enforceable is another question. Given that Canonical ships copyright notices saying that the software may be distributed in source or binary form, and the only use of the trademarks is in some ancillary metadata on the packages rather than included in the packages themselves, it&#x27;s unclear if this would actually be considered infringing on their trademark. But the FUD caused by their refusal to clarify this point means that it&#x27;s a risk for anyone to try doing so; it&#x27;s possible that a court could decide that it is likely to cause confusion, even in just the form of ancillary metadata in binary packages.",1448321514

So your nonblocking IO would instead push events onto the queue, and let Node move on to the next tick.

To properly criticize a subject, /you have to take the premise seriously/, which is what Verhoeven didn&#x27;t do.<p>The premise, the basic engine of the book, is a young man&#x27;s coming of age story into military and society, and his longing to reconnect with his father. It&#x27;s not really about fascism or propaganda. This shows that Verhoeven didn&#x27;t really even care to understand the book. He critiqued what he thought it was about.<p>This is a longer post I wrote on reddit back in 2013:<p>&quot;I argue that&#x27;s why it sucks as a critique, because it just allows you to laugh and blow off the propaganda as fluff, instead of taking it seriously.<p>What&#x27;s scary about Nazism, fascism, totalitarianism, etc. is how many people fall for it and then commit horrible acts, believing they&#x27;re doing the right thing, while getting teary-eyed for the state.<p>When you read Starship Troopers, you find yourself getting a misty-eyed sentiment for the corps and &quot;The Brave Sacrifice that our men and women make...&quot; and then you think &quot;WTF? This novel is about space bugs. Holy hell, this propaganda shit works!&quot; and you begin to realize how insidious and effective the propaganda truly is.<p>When you watch Starship Troopers, you just laugh and say &quot;Oh, what a ridiculous movie. Ha ha ha, isn&#x27;t that funny.&quot; You don&#x27;t fall for the propaganda, which is what an effective critique would have you do. Instead, you can stay above it and laugh condescendingly at those poor idiots who do, and then get eviscerated by space bugs. But you, as an audience member, are too smart for that, because you can clearly see that it&#x27;s a sound stage. It allows you to remain safe in your comfort zone, whereas real art would expose you to your own vulnerability.<p>It&#x27;s like the people who think they&#x27;re getting a dig in on Hitler by calling him an &quot;asshole&quot; and saying &quot;Fuck you, Hitler!&quot; Sorry, not really the level of critique and understanding we need for Nazism. That&#x27;s not a strong-enough tearing apart of Nazism.<p>Likewise, we need something stronger then a self-aware B-flick science fiction parody to criticize Starship Troopers. It doesn&#x27;t really do the job. It&#x27;s not a critique of the book, though it is a critique of militarism and state propaganda.<p>A true critique of Starship Troopers would address the actual mechanisms that Heinlein employs in the book, such as nostalgia, camaraderie, and espirit de corp, or the main character&#x27;s estranged relationship with his father, and the role that seems to play in his finding fulfillment in military life. It&#x27;s actual military service and culture, not state propaganda, that informs Rico&#x27;s beliefs and feelings in the book.<p>Instead we get a movie seemingly inspired by Starship Troopers, taking place in the same universe, but not actually dealing with the themes presented in the book. And at that, a boring, B-grade science fiction parody that&#x27;s supposed to be interesting because it knows its a parody wink, wink. It&#x27;s not a criticism of the book.&quot;<p>&quot;A criticism is basically a comedy, and a comedy has a straight man and a clown. In a parody or a farce, the comedic target is the buffoon, and the audience is the straight man who&#x27;s job it is to say, &quot;Hey, get your act together, stop fooling around!&quot; But the mechanism of the comedic critique is that the target is too stupid to know better, and continues acting the clown.<p>When the movie is winking at the audience, it&#x27;s not the clown because then it&#x27;s in on the joke. Being over the top and cheesy, we know that the movie isn&#x27;t taking itself seriously; it&#x27;s playing dumb instead of being actually dumb. It&#x27;s saying &quot;hey, isn&#x27;t this silly&quot; instead of presenting actually silliness. As the audience, there is no position for criticism because the movie already knows it&#x27;s misbehaving. It&#x27;s our role to say &quot;hey, this is silly&quot;, and when the movie does our role for us, it&#x27;s boring because it allows us no participation.<p>Take this scenario:<p><pre><code>    Man on sidewalk: Hitting head with hammer.\n\n    Passer-by: &quot;Hey! Don&#x27;t do that! You&#x27;ll hurt yourself!&quot;\n\n    Man on Sidewalk: &quot;But how will I get rid of these lice!?&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s a comedic scenario (regardless of its quality). The Man is doing something actually dumb, being a buffoon, and the passer-by is criticizing the action, being the straight man. Now take this:<p><pre><code>    Man on Sidewalk: &quot;Hey buddy, wouldn&#x27;t it be silly if I hit my head with a hammer, like this?&quot; Hits head with hammer &quot;It&#x27;s that crazy?&quot;\n\n    Passer-by: &quot;Yeah, that&#x27;s crazy&quot;.\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s not a comedic scenario because the Man on sidewalk has taken both the roles of buffoon and straight man. In presenting the action as stupid, he&#x27;s also acting as the straight man, his own critic, and the Passer-by has no role in the interaction; he adds nothing, he just agrees with the Man.<p>When you read Starship Troopers, its presented sincerely, at face value. That leads you to take it seriously, think about it, question it, arrive at your own conclusions. You play the straight man, questioning the actions of the guy on the sidewalk.<p>The movie is presented as a farce, a joke, &quot;Hey look at this, isn&#x27;t this ridiculous?&quot; &quot;Yes, it is, why am I watching it?&quot; It&#x27;s clearly over the top, an exaggerated caricature. It doesn&#x27;t lead you to think deeply about the issues presented, it allows you to blow them off as silliness and fluff. There&#x27;s no role for you here, nothing to engage in. You just agree: &quot;Yup, this is totally ridick!&quot;<p>It&#x27;s like getting 1984 wrong. These books are seminal in American and trans-Atlantic thought about government and the individual. It&#x27;s too important not to do the best job at.&quot;",1448319769

4771537,comment,4770861,4771266,2,0,ww520,,,"> Nothing! The problems occur when people think that it's not.<p>I don't really understand what you are trying to get at.  Is it wrong or it isn't?<p>The hipster comment is spotted on.  This post is evident of that attitude.  The OP has to dig up an internal class whose name is probably generated to bash Java.  And your original comment basically went further and claimed this long class name is the evident of what is so wrong with Java in general.<p>If there's no pressing pressure to refactor, then it has work well for its purpose.  You want to limit class name to 8 characters to force programmers to pick shorter name?  It's an internal class, for god sake.  What's the impact on 99.99% of the programmer out there?<p>Development is a process of compromise and trade-off.  Developers don't have infinite time and infinite budget to code.  They have to pick their battle and do the more important things.",1352692782

4771528,comment,4770521,4771126,2,0,csense,,,"What I'm going to say only applies to K-12 schools in the USA.  College is much better.<p>In many places teachers' unions are strong.  Unions tend to unconditionally reward seniority.  They frown on management being able to tie pay to talent/ability, or get rid of people who are grossly incompetent (let alone merely below average).  So the talented are frustrated because their abilities aren't recognized, and tend to leave if they have better options, while bad teachers know that they have a safe job once they get their foot in the door.<p>With high-stakes standardized testing, nonessentials like computer science have a tendency to take very low priority.  Many high schools' definition of ""computer science"" is ""how to use Word and PowerPoint, and maybe make a website (if you're lucky)""<p>Actual programming is something students generally venture into on their own.  Teachers -- especially bad ones -- often feel threatened by students who are smarter than they are.  (Remember, schools attract the incompetent.)  Students are actively discouraged from pursuing advanced topics like programming on school equipment (and in some cases are even punished).",1352692516

But my grades aren't where they need to be, so I probably won't be able to transfer to a good school. Honestly I've been concerned whether or not I can afford it anyways. Going for a junior position, or even a paid non-college-affiliated internship, is far more appealing.<p>I've got a pretty decent GitHub, and I've launched a few apps with another in the works. My major (and it is major) concern is that I don't have a good grasp on CS fundamentals - algorithms, data structures, etc. But it seems easier now than ever to teach yourself this - whether through Coursera, or through reading a variety of sources, and practicing on sites like Project Euler or Interview Street.<p>Maybe Hugo's experience was different than the average developer drop-out because of his ability to get into App Academy, but I'd like to think anyone who can demonstrate programming knowledge and intelligence has a shot, degree or not.",1352692462

4771420,comment,4769667,4771247,1,0,jules,,,"I meant that in the context of making a decision. The point of statistics is to make decisions. For example you want to know whether a medical treatment works so that you can decide whether or not to give it to people. So you do a hypothesis test to see whether the treatment works better than a placebo, and then if the p-value is small enough you give it to people, and otherwise you don't. Instead of explicitly separating the assumptions (prior & utility) from the logical deduction, the assumptions are embedded in this procedure. Why would the assumptions implicitly made by the choice of procedure be the assumptions you want to make? You take the answer to a question that's irrelevant to the decision, namely ""given that the treatment doesn't work, how likely is the data"" and try to tweak a decision based on that. There is no principled way to make decisions based on that information.<p>Credibility intervals are about average-case coverage, but Bayesian statistics as a whole is definitely NOT just about average case. In general the utility `U` is a function of the decision `d`, and of the posterior knowledge you have of the world `P`. In many practical cases the utility might be the expected profit: U(d,P) = integral(profit(x,d)P(x)dx). But it certainly doesn't have to be. If you are risk averse you might choose your utility as U(d,P) = min_x profit(x,d) to ensure that your utility is the minimum profit you make given a decision, rather than the average. Another example is U(x,P) = P(x) which gives maximum likelihood estimation. Making a decision based on a hypothesis test can also be emulated with a utility function. Suppose the hypothesis is H and we make decision d1 if p-value > alpha and d2 if p-value < alpha. We choose a prior P(I) that makes each possible observed data set I equally likely, and we choose the utility function that reverses Bayes' rule to compute P(I|H) to make a decision based on that:<p><pre><code>    U(d1,P') = [P'(H)*P(I)/P(H) > alpha]\n    U(d2,P') = [P'(H)*P(I)/P(H) < alpha]\n</code></pre>\nwhere brackets are indicator notation. Note that P(I) appears to access the data set which the utility function does not have access to, but recall that P(I) is constant regardless of the measured data. Of course not many people have such a prior and utility function...so it doesn't really make sense to hard code them into the method.<p>In general the process works like this. Given prior P and utility U and measured information I:<p>1. Compute posterior P' from prior P and information I according to Bayes' rule.\n2. Perform decision argmax_d U(d,P').<p>Can you point me to a similarly principled approach to decision making based on utility with frequentist methods?",1352689596

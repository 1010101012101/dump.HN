Problem solving is not a feature of hardware per se, it is done by humans. Perhaps one day by AIs, too, if we can discover how to program them.<p>Two tantalising potential benefits of Quantum Computers:<p>(1) the ability to model all kinds of matter efficiently at the molecular level which will spur the development of nanotech<p>(2) people will ask 'Where are these humongous computations being performed?' and then embrace the 'many worlds interpretation' of quantum mechanics, which will in turn create further scientific and philosophical progress",1329674315

Complaining about this is about as useful as complaining about the walled-garden approach to the App store. They release a new OS every year, and simultaneously phase out support for older Macs. There are positives (people aren't running thirteen-year-old computers, so developers can make reasonable assumptions about the power of the machine) and negatives (ridiculously wasteful), but it's their BUSINESS MODEL.<p>With that in mind, if you're going to argue that it's bad practice, please do so from a business standpoint, not from a technical standpoint.

But anyway, my uncle offered to take a slot machine to their house set it up so they could play all they wanted without cost, or gain! Nobody he offered that to wanted to play without winning.<p>As for the ""non-gaming"" i.e. not casino type games, such as the MMOROGs/social games I would say players are aware before they play no money is won (unless there are side bets) but levels are status are probably just as valuable to them. Even with slots I have seen people trying to win the jackpot which may be $500 yet spend weeks trying to get it spending 100x that amount, or a bonus pot/progressive which may be almost nothing; it's not so much the money as it is the feeling but with slots it doesn't pay out in feelings only money.<p>For all of those examples I always think of an article I read about the US military where soldiers in WWI and WWII were not shooting at the enemy, soldiers were frozen with fear. So a system was created where the soldiers were trained to shoot at a target that popped up and when hit it would fall down. The response was to shoot and when hit the falling target was the reward and it got to the point the soldier would shoot it without thought more instinct. This training is called ""Stimulus Response Reward"" and I think gambling as well as any repetitive system seems to condition people to act, add to that genetic predisposition of gamblers to gamble on top of SRS.",1329673835

Now, before you start laughing look here: [2] This is Dr. White [3] undergoing successful monkey brain transplantation in... seventies! I think 40 years later technology got much more advanced.<p>So the result would be your 80 years old brain (assume it was still quite healthy) in 100% matching DNA body of 25 year old. IF you don't get brain cancer, or other brain disease, you have another 50, 80 years to go. Now, going further only certain parts of the brain makes up for your identity. Most likely only memory. Fast forward another 40 years in the future, knowing how to connect broken nerves again why not cut only small part of your brain that is <i>you</i> therefore transplanting only your identity and limiting size of your old body in the new one.<p>Now, you can call me a conspiracy theorist, but if to overcome problems here is just a matter of time (by that I mean more time == less money + less engineers working on the problem. less time to resolve problem == more money to throw at the research + more engineers working on it), then I believe it is fairly plausible that elites like Rothschild family having billions of dollars for their disposition already have these technology available.

It has nothing to do with moving to iOS. Same for many changes that annoy people on Lion. My pet peeve are the monochrome sidebar icons in Finder, iTunes, etc., which offer less clues for the eyes - say what you want, but they have nothing to do with iOS. The only parallel on iOS is 'Settings' and it uses colorful icons. Blaming it on an unavoidable convergence with iOS is a lazy way to avoid any debate.<p>2. Unless there is anything wrong with the actual hardware, this is not 'for progress' but just planned obscolescence as usual. Apple has zero financial incentive to support old devices. I don't blame them for that, it seems like they are legitimally trying to make money off software, but right now they're a hardware company.<p>The companies that actually strive for software market penetration/hardware conservation like Microsoft or Google (with Android or Chromebooks) have the incentive to run on everything at the latest version, but it doesn't work out either.

""explain the algorithms with code instead of math"" is what's tripping me up, what exactly are you looking for? Algorithms are often described as pseudocode, so you want a book that explains pseudocode with code? At some point you have to move to another level of abstraction when talking about an algorithm, which is why mathematical language is used. That said, you could try CLRS. That seems to be the gold standard in algorithms books.",1329672811

I see no social imperative for free hardware designs like the imperative for free software. Freedom to copy software is an important right because it is easy now--any computer user can do it. Freedom to copy hardware is not as important, because copying hardware is hard to do. Present-day chip and board fabrication technology resembles the printing press. Copying hardware is as difficult as copying books was in the age of the printing press, or more so. So the ethical issue of copying hardware is more like the ethical issue of copying books 50 years ago, than like the issue of copying software today.""<p><a href=""http://www.linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=1999-06-22-005-05-NW-LF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=1999-06-22-00...</a>",1329672641

I could imagine, for example, that their operational meaning of a variable becomes that of consecutive boxes with values in them. Given that knowledge, how would such a student start to understand a variable in a closure? Will it fit their existing understanding of variables as boxes? Maybe it does, maybe it will not. Maybe they have to deconstruct their understanding of variables first to connect it to their budding understanding of a closure, building a deeper and more widely understanding of variable. Maybe this will be not too much of a problem. Maybe this becomes a hurdle. We don't know unless we try it out, of course.<p>Learning isn't an exact science. I think that dynamic representations like this one are very useful in teaching and learning. However, I would also argue to use these tools with care and conscience. Although it seems to fit our operational view of a program, that does not mean it is a good fit of a novice learner's operational view of a program. Whatever tools we use will influence that operational view. What I want to ask teachers is to evaluate and reflect on the best way and place (in space/time) to use these tools to make learning as optimal as possible.",1329671965

3609697,comment,3608531,3608923,1,0,malandrew,,,"Surprisingly, I've often heard the following argument (except your point about space). Traditional intersections, despite being cheaper to install, are less economical from a total cost of ownership and all associated externalities perspective<p>The other benefit of roundabouts is they provide a much simpler situation for cars to encounter, since the intersection could be dumb and simpler heuristics should be able to resolve the management of traffic. A simple four way stop sign wouldn't be too hard, but I can't imagine trying to figure out much less optimize a complex highly trafficked 4 way intersection. A 4 way intersection basically forces you to coordinate centrally to optimize, instead of distributing the logic among participants in the intersection and only putting in central coordinating logic when traffic is very heavy. And even then, I'd expect it more to provide information to the vehicles entering about the vehicles already present and about to enter and letting the vehicles decide what is best.",1329670916

3609695,comment,3608697,3608697,8,0,caffeine5150,,,"I was born and raised in Las Vegas.  Actually, my family goes back to the '30's there.  Some of the strategies mentioned in the article are a bit more complex than I've thought about, but are unsurprising.  I've noticed more basic things like the round and meandering layout of casinos that make you (a) walk past the gaming areas to get anywhere and (b) make it difficult to navigate your way out of the gaming areas.  Other techniques are the minimizing of natural light and absence of clocks so as not to remind people how much time is going by.  This is all in addition to the inherent addictive nature of gambling.  They've shown that rats in a cage, when presented with a lever that randomly delivers food when activated, will begin to obsessively trigger the lever and let the food pile up rather than hitting it only when they are hungry.  In fact, B.F. Skinner, the father of behaviorist thought wrote a somewhat tongue in cheek paper in which he postulated that the gambling drive is so powerful that we could easily abolish all mandatory taxes if we instead encouraged people at a young age to gamble (on lotteries, etc.) - we'd have all the tax revenue we'd need.<p>I don't think most of these more exotic strategies (i.e. other than gaming itself and alcohol) were consciously employed when organized crime ran the industry.  They made so much money skimming profits that they weren't too worried about squeezing dimes out nor were they sophisticated in that way (they were very sophisticated in other ways).  In that time, the culture was marked by personal relationships (who you know), ""comping"" or giving free things, cheap rooms and food, more live entertainment, more well dressed adults going out at night rather than people walking the strip in the day pushing strollers, etc.  Also there was a notable lack of violent crime in and around the casino areas.  Organized crime wouldn't allow purse snatchers, card cheats, etc.  (Of course I mean other than the crime committed by the mafia in enforcing this peace or crime among themselves).<p>This all changed as corporations began to run things and the mafia became more marginalized beginning in the '90's.  The corporation's spreadsheet toting MBA's began calculating profitability on a per-square-foot basis.  This resulted in less comping, more expensive food and hotel rooms, live entertainment replaced with more video poker, and many of the more esoteric strategies to induce gaming profits such as those mentioned in the article.  It also resulted in some notable failures - for example the idea of appealing to families by adding huge kids rides and carnival style game areas.  (This idea was taken from the Circus Circus Hotel which was the first to have that.)  The idea kind of flopped and the hotels realized that people with kids don't spend 16 hours at a blackjack table (shocker).  A spectacular example of this was the theme park behind the MGM that they eventually tore down.  They shifted back to gaming and adult entertainment launching the ""what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas"" campaign and we saw the rise of casinos like the Palms that appealed to young men trying to relive the cool sophistication of Hugh Hefner's days in the '60s.",1329670862
3609694,comment,3607217,3607217,1,0,mckoss,,,"It's a compelling story, BUT, are libraries really the best way to solve this social problem?  Most tax payers don't realize just how expensive their library system is.  In my county, we spend $90 million per year for our libraries - about 0.5% of property taxes.  As a home owner, neary 15% of the cost of your home, is being funneled to the library system.<p>I am very in favor of community public investment, but I am skeptical that our libraries are an efficient allocation of the very large claim they already have on our public taxes.<p>Note in this story how the grandfather was so poorly served by the system.  It's not designed to serve those who need the system most.  In the end he only gets reluctant help from someone overqualified (overpaid) to give him the kind of assistance he needs.<p>Unlike other suggestions in this thread, I do not agree that the answer is to prop up the failing library system by pretending to use its services to make their numbers look better.  We should be demanding that our libraries evolve to remove wasteful and expensive services (that many of its users can already afford to pay for directly), and focus on the needs of those who cannot pay.<p>Our average library staff salary and benefits cost $25/hr - couldn't we double the assistance to the underprivileged by paying trained ""Web Assistants"" $10/hr to help them instead?",1329670852

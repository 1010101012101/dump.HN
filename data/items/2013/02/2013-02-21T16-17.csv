Particularly if the total weight is sufficient to cause the snap-bracelet to slide toward 'open', even a bit, as your wrist rotates or travels through the air. And evenly distributing the weight over an entire-surface-screen would be quite a challenge, given the internals.<p>I think it more likely a production device along those lines would have a series of fixed potential-attachment-points and strong magnets to counter the forces caused by the weight of the device and movement of the wrist.  And the screen wouldn't need to be over the entire device, but simply enough of the 'top' so that it could reasonably serve the various potential-attachment-point configurations. (the magnets would also provide a simple and consistent way to determine just <i>how</i> open or closed the device is)",1361465908

Think about that and reply, given the ability of your adversary to send arbitrary traffic.<p>> To not multiple the comments - what I said above about a single TCP packet obviously implies being on the route between the parties.<p>How is this seriously distinguishable from MITM? I mean what the hell. Come on you're stretching definitions here.<p>Uhhh anyway, I think in about 5 years you might be right. Practically speaking no consumer hardware has ipsec embedded but hopefully everyone will in the next few years.<p>The last time I was in Taiwan working on ASIC hardware none of the white brands did (and most of the big brands are just buying that crap and re-labelling it). Yeah designed in $country? Nah. Taiwan is super good at design, they just need the vendor and the label on the box.  Anwyay, that was 2 years ago though, and I was just doing consumer bullshit.<p>In case you're interested (and you're probably not) the ASIC NAT hardware was the only there coz it enabled the anemic CPU to NAT at the box rated speed. Unfortunately it also turns out, that's why most home users can't seriously torrent or do nice things :( Damn ASICs.<p>People wonder sometimes why ""open source"" version is more expensive, and in terms of consumer routers, it's because the pure linux versions don't have the secret sauce. You gotta use more CPU and memory. It's a worthwhile trade-off for not putting up with a real RTOS. But also, good luck MIMO 450 Mbps wireless N using just the broadcom CPU at the rated Mhz :)  I'm not even sure if they license the drivers for open source now, I know they definitely didn't before.<p>There are some really hilarious things which happen where like $marketing from $vendor decide that not only they need a custom enclosure (everyone needs that), but that the box would look way better if the antennas were arranged in certain way. This triggers multiple all-nighters from the engineers who have to relayout the boards and redo the EMC tests.<p>Wait, I'm way off topic. I think my original point is that you probably don't have ipsec in hardware at home. I await brutal smackdown, coz the community is knowledgable.",1361465794

You're only describing a lock that requires tools we currently don't have to get it open without the key.

1) would have nowhere to go for a cheap and brutal protection.
2) would not worry that someone else will use cheap and brutal protection against them.<p>Why is it cheap? Because couple of millions of bucks spent on lawyers is nothing comparing to amount of tax money and propaganda that fuels police and courts.<p>No company that earns money from voluntary exchange would risk creating its own armed gang: it will quickly run out of customers well before raising enough funds for a small army.<p>And if you are afraid that in absence of tax-funded police, some private companies would not protect themselves and their customers, but instead become super-powerful mafia themselves, then it is yet another reason why you cannot have monopoly of violent power in the first place.<p>My suggestion: no reasoning and intellectual debate is possible if there is a gun in the room.

5258456,comment,5255362,5256158,1,0,darkarmani,,,"> This is not true. The reason earlier employees receive more stock than later employees is that everyone is receiving the same dollar amount, but how much stock you get for that dollar amount changes. To keep it simple, if you are employee #1 and you get $100k of stock at a company valued at $10M, you get 1% of the company. Later, if you get $100k of stock valued at $100M, you get .1%, etc.<p>> This makes a whole lot of sense: first, the company was super speculative and full of risk when the earliest employees joined. Then, their efforts directly contributed to the company being (much) more valuable. This was not a guaranteed process, they took on a lot of risk (things could have gone miserably south). They are rewarded for that risk when the company grows.<p>If they are giving the same value of stock, isn't that less reward for the risk?  I would hope that risk plays into the value of stock granted by employees (ie: 100k and then 50k grants).",1361465407

Besides this fact, they were only written down about 500 years after Gautama Buddha died. Third, the words that were written down were those as transmitted by ordinary people, who had a huge gap in level of consciousness between them and Buddha, so they didn't understand exactly and didn't write down Buddha's exact words. And fourth, the scriptures have been changed by a number of monks who just wrote what they wanted in there. It's in these processes that the truth which Buddha taught was changed and has deteriorated through thousands of years.<p>You asked a very good question. Buddha, when he was Enlightened, also attained nirvana. What this means is that he saw the world of origin, where everything dies and is reborn again. This is why he could see that all the results are made by the causes. So, it's because nothing exists in the world of origin that Gautama said that there's nothing there. But Buddhist monks often misunderstand this as that when you attain nirvana you can finish all your suffering. However, Buddha never claimed that. He explained that when he attained nirvana he could be free from agony and illusions. But no creature while it is alive can be free from suffering. If we don't eat, we suffer from starvation. If we go to a cold place, we feel cold. So to cease suffering forever means that one would have to stop being reborn and die forever. The only way to free from suffering while you are alive is to disengage your consciousness from your body. This is what modern buddhism guides you to do through meditation. But it's the exact opposite way of Buddha's teaching. Buddha taught people to save themselves and to live forever, not to die forever.",1361464914

5258378,comment,5257432,5257825,1,0,bpatrianakos,,,"I don't think that's an issue at all. I get what you're saying though. I know many times I've built something that already exists and whenever it happens my version falls into one of 3 categories:<p>1. Something that someone else is doing better. Fail.<p>2. Something someone else is doing exactly the same. DRY/don't reinvent the wheel fail.<p>3. Something that does something seemingly the same as others but because it adds something others don't.<p>I think urlbox falls into category 3. There are lots of ways that a new entrant can be successful. Just tailoring it to a specific use-case honestly goes a long way towards success in my book. For example, Blitshot seems to be all about image processing of screenshots in general (and if it's not let's say it is for the sake of example) - you get an API for screenshots and image manipulation and it's up to you to find a use for it. But if someone else enters the fold, like urlbox perhaps, and says ""our API is for purpose X and you can only use it in these ways"" they could actually be very successful despite not offering what someone else is. There are a lot of people who'd rather use a product with less features in general but whose features are tailored to their use case than another product which offers the same and more but with no specific focus. Look at Pinboard. It's basically Delicious for a specific user group. All it lacks is the social aspect of it which you're not forced to use with Delicious anyway plus Pinboard is far more expensive (anything is ""far more"" expensive than free). I think Pinboard is a great example even if it doesn't fit exactly.",1361464535

She didn't really support any of her argument and used a lot of emotionally charged language that I interpreted to mean she had been told that she wasn't a good 'culture fit' for a job.<p>harryh here, felt I was being dismissive (pejoratively) of her accusations, which I sought to understand better as that  wasn't my intent. He proceeds to try to put together an argument around the emotion shanley wrote.<p>The basis for my compassion to shanley's emotion was that I have experienced people who are trying to work in a place that is incompatible with a company's culture, and so I see 'cultural fit' as a legitimate line of reasoning for not offering someone a job. I've also seen those same people flourish when they found a better fit for their style of work.<p>That said, any part of a company's culture that is based on sex, age, race, religion, or sexual orientation is fundamentally illegal. But that isn't what we're talking about here, people who ""love sports"" are not a protected class.<p>So perhaps it is required that one stipulate in a discussion on culture that any culture that subverts existing anti-discrimination laws either by intent or by proxy is bad and should be called out as such. Prosecuted even. If so, consider it so stipulated.<p>And I would be the first person to say, in a discussion of company culture that the more inclusive and supporting a culture is of diversity and viewpoints, it is both healthier and more successful for the company over all as it is welcoming to the largest number of potential employees.<p>But that is not what this thread was about. Not for me. This thread was about ascribing malice and deceit to some concepts that are bandied about in the form of company culture. I see it as unfair to those companies who really care about their employees, and offering up one of these as a company value only to find the well poisoned by a someone such as shanley.

You need to either apologize/console the investor that you will somehow get back his money.""<p>No, on typical seed round investments (and even Series A and above), you do not owe the investors back their money. There's not even a moral obligation to pay them back--they understand the risks, and as others have stated above in the comments, if this loss was going to make them destitute, they should absolutely not ever have been investing in your round.

Both not only destroy the area actually minded but produce enormous amounts of liquid and solid waste (coal slurry and fly ash are the worst) that destroy whatever environment they are deposited into.<p>Second, however you cut it, the fundamental chemical reaction is going to be CxHxOx + O2 => CO2. There is no way to avoid producing carbon dioxide if you want and exothermic reaction. So you get carbon dioxide capture schemes. The problem is once you capture the carbon dioxide no one has any idea what to do with. There are vague notions that we can pump it underground, but pilot projects in this area have been dismal failures both because of a lack of confidence that the CO2 will remain buried and because of the high energy costs in burying the CO2.<p>Third, aside from CO2, coal has a variety of other nasty constituents: mercury, uranium, thorium, arsenic among others.",1361463226

And perhaps also what you mean by ""HTML"".<p>Case in point: A while back I ran into a nasty bug in our software which would cause it to crash with a stack overflow exception.  It turned out to be that the problem was in how HTML Agility Pack would respond to certain kinds of particularly poorly-formed HTML documents.<p>Now, we had chosen to use HTML Agility Pack in part because of all the comments to the effect of ""NOOOOOO don't use regex, use Agility Pack!"" complete with links to a certain famous Stack Overflow answer that are littered around the internet.  But in analzying the situation in more detail, we discovered a few things:  First, we were just stripping tags, so our parsing needs were very minor compared to what HTML Agility pack does.  Second, generating a full-on parse tree for an HTML document was kind of harming us, in that doing so takes both time and RAM, two things we were trying to be light on.  Third, we could afford to be fairly tolerant of a missed tag or some lost content, but the parser giving up was a minor tragedy.  Noisy results were far better than no results for our purposes.<p>The upshot of all this being, for our ""HTML parsing"" needs, regular expressions turned out to be <i>exactly</i> the right tool for the job.  Following that realization, it was the work of only one afternoon to fix the bug, and as a side benefit dramatically improve both the engine's performance and the quality of its output.<p>Long story short, what passes for common wisdom on the Internet is no substitute for knowing what you're doing.",1361462973

Void elements like <img> and <br> don't have matching close tags and contents for things like <textarea> and <script> are treated as text (you can't nest more tags inside). Then you have the issue of javascript being able to call document.write at HTML-parsing times, something you need to hope doesn't happen or parsing becomes intractable. Finally, There is a vast number of rules and special cases that kick off when you have missing or mis-nested tags or tags being put in the wrong places.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/</a>",1361462654

On Linux and Mac I make it hidden by having a dot prefix in the filename.  To make it hidden on Windows I had to use a Win32 call (SetFileAttributes) and wrap the access in a call to unhide it and then rehide it afterwards.<p>When the tool finds problems it can open the browser on a local copy of the documentation shipped with the tool.  However opening web pages with anchors has the anchor ignored on Windows making things that much more hostile.<p>Those were just the waste of time on one utility, not to mention all the testing to find them.  Multiply by everything else and it just isn't worth it. Some of our stuff does intensive file I/O.  This is a lot slower in a VM.<p>It all adds up to a death by a 1,000 cuts.",1361462508

I own www.1112.net and used to own www.wackycreations.com. I put the last page of the Internet online however the idea was not mine. I was working at UUNET at the time and had received the joke over email. It was worded differently, it was: Attention: you have reached the very last page of the internet, now turn off your computer. I loved the joke, but wanted to spruce it up a little bit. I changed it to: Attention: You have reached the very last page of the Internet. We hope you have enjoyed your browsing. Now turn off your computer and go outside and play.<p>I then posted it up on www.1112.net/lastpage.html (and it was also the 404 page). When I left UUNET I emailed a link to my lastpage site to UUNETs darknet mail list, making mention that there was no longer a point to working here anymore. It is likely that the tech savvy UUNETers helped lastpage go viral well before the phrase viral was coined.<p>The site got an amazing number of hits with one month grossing over 8 million hits. I had to upgrade my server to a dedicated server and at one point I even tried putting adds on it to recoup some of my lost $$. The adds received a lot of complaints and didnt make enough money to pay for the server so I removed them A true last page has no links.<p>I registered 1112.net in 1998 and left UUNET in 2001. I will try to figure out when exactly I posted my lastpage online and reply back here when I figure that out.
Thanks!<p><>Darin",1361462483

Patent law was not a voluntary contract that Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Google and others negotiated between each other up front. It was imposed by entirely different group of people who pay armed soldiers to enforce their decisions.<p>This is how patent system could have been done without violence: a group of tech companies willing to protect their IP come together and agree on a single protocol which will register their inventions. They will list what kinds of inventions are patentable and not patentable. If something in this protocol remains vague to anyone it won't be signed. Then, they agree to regularly elect a group of experts who would inspect all incoming submissions and decide which non-patented inventions are violating or not the existing patents. Every participant would have to follow the decision of the experts, or would have to appeal to other participants (in order to re-elect the experts, reexamine the protocol, or reexamine this particular decision).<p>If participant does not follow the decision of the experts, he is publicly defamed and economically ostracised, just like any other non-participant who violates existing patents. If any participant does not punish violators via ostracism (whether participants or not), he himself is ostracised by others.<p>If a large enough group of tech companies really values patents over costs of ostracism, they can do just that. (Like they agree not to hiring specialists from each other.) If they don't find the way to agree on patents, then they do not deserve them. And nobody should go to prison because of that. My gut feeling is that neither Google, nor Apple, nor Microsoft likes patents. They could agree about hiring top people, about very specific trademarks like logos, but they would never spend time fighting over rounded corners if they were not given a poisonous weapon which is a tax-funded patent office, police and prisons.<p>Resume: You do not need violent intervention with guns and prisons to protect yourself. Example: Apple's customers do not like working conditions of its partners' factories, so they can ostracise Apple. Apple in response asks factories to improve conditions, or Apple will ostracise them. There is no violence, but only negotiation.",1361462478

While there will always be insane amounts of work to be done on them and deliver improvements until we see some brand new device interaction paradigm delivered - OSs will be boring, (relatively) stable and getting job done.<p>So - there are few reasons to push the OS as a brand to retail consumers. Pitch hard to developers, but for consumers for which the os is app store + launcher - it won't help you increase sales much.",1361462444

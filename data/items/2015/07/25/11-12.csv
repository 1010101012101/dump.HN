That is the most common interpretation at least.<p>This is exactly why LGPL exists: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_Lice...</a><p>For open source class libraries, LGPL makes the most sense and is used by the vast majority of libraries in the Linux world.<p>Also, some libraries are GPL-licensed specifically to protect commercial interests. Under such a dual licensing scheme, you can use the free GPL version, but then your app has to be GPL as well... Or you can pay for a commercial license that lets you build closed-source apps using the library.<p>Qt used to have that kind of dual license, but they switched to LGPL after Nokia acquired Qt sometime around 2008.",1437825558

9947316,comment,9946385,9946744,0,0,aschreyer,,,"> In Germany, it is thanks to European monetary policy that artificially depresses the Deutsche Mark, allowing for cheaper exports and lower costs for German companies, as well as a captive market whose currency is overvalued in exactly the same way destroying local industry (i.e. German loans pay for German cars to be sold to the Europeans but the other way round is much harder). Hello VW, goodbye Rover. On top of this Germany is absorbing East Germany which is a handy source of incredibly cheap labour (in the same way that illegal labour is in the US food and farm industry) AND massive subsidies for whoever wants to go take advantage of it (I know a company that opened a very, very expensive plant 200km from Berlin because the subsidy was such that they came out profitable even if the plant lost money for 20 years).<p>Fascinating story, if only Germany had started producing cars in 2000 with the introduction of the Euro. How do you think VW, Audi etc. fared in the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s (and the rest of the German economy in general)? In addition, the Euro is pretty much irrelevant because the cars are mostly produced in the region where there are sold - do you think the exchange rate is relevant for the VW factories in Mexico, Tennessee and Pennsylvania for the north American market? How does a cheap Euro make the import of resources from outside the Eurozone cheaper, steel, aluminium etc.?",1437824947

We are figuring out the rules and we are continuously improving our tools to manipulate stuff at an ever lower level. Once we can easily manipulate the building blocks our existence is based on, it opens the door to such a tremendously large number of ways how things can go wrong that the probability of self-destruction comes very close to 1. It would require an extremely high intelligence to deal with all these failure modes, something that an biochemistry-based evolutionary process is highly unlikely to bring forth. The problem is basically that figuring the rules out is much easier than using them safely.

9947212,comment,9946385,9947183,0,0,crdb,,,"My mistake. I had a point to make about immigration but forgot to make it, the draft stayed in place. Regarding long term immigration, I thought gaijins could never secure PR or citizenship (i.e. residence not tied to work) unlike in say the US (Green Card) or Singapore (PR, PEP) to name two.<p>FWIW I think immigration policy being overly strict harms economic growth in two ways:<p>- depleting the supply of talent increasing the cost of running a business that depends on the talent;<p>- stopping foreign founders from starting a business in your country to take advantage of its better conditions cuts the number of high growth businesses.<p>On the first point, Singapore is the extreme example. There are/were no Haskell developers there at least at the price we were able to pay (because the only Haskellers were at Standard Chartered making about twice as much). I tell this story often so the details might be fuzzy as time passes and the numbers dissolve in my memory, but our job ad had 150 qualified applicants (i.e. completed our selection task and it compiled and worked as expected) from the rest of the world (mostly from the US, Canada and Northern Europe) and 0 from Singapore, not even on EPs, although two SCB chaps did get in touch informally asking about the salary range.<p>My then team of 10 would never have existed had Singapore not had its extremely open Employment Pass system (which the US does not have); every single member (bar one Singaporean who learnt Haskell) was &quot;imported&quot;. In practice, we had planned for this eventuality and had looked into alternative locations; half the team ended up remote anyway.<p>On the second point, I once made a back of the envelope calculation showing that around 40% of famous Silicon Valley founders (i.e. Intel, Apple, etc. level companies - I just took the list of the highest valued and kept working down until I had a significant sample) were first or second generation immigrants. Taking our two examples, Jobs had a Syrian father and Andy Grove was born Andris Gróf in Budapest.<p>The real damage of the H1-B policy (other than being a lottery and being gamed to hell and back) is thus tying the visa to a workplace. It&#x27;s not damaging per se, since one could in theory spin up a company and apply for the visa; it&#x27;s damaging in practice, because the process takes months, expensive lawyers, and piles of paperwork which is definitely not &quot;useful&quot; work and usually unaffordable to a &quot;normal&quot; startup founder. Singapore, again, has it right: an Employment Pass takes around 7 working days to be approved, making it extremely easy to change jobs.<p>(However, due to people using its EntrePass to skip investor visa requirements, it now has ridiculous requirements such as hiring levels to be maintained and having to be invested in from a shortlist of approved investors none of which actually do seed investing. So people spin up a company with their accountant as the local director and get themselves an Employment Pass that way...)<p>It&#x27;s never been easier and cheaper to start an international software company, and software is &quot;eating the world&quot; so I suspect at some point a location will realize the potential. I wonder how long Silicon Valley&#x27;s advantage in capital and knowledge will last as it restricts its effective talent pool to a population of 300 million vs the other 9 billion in the world rapidly arriving to middle class living standards and knowledge; but so far no country has gone forward and allowed foreigners (or non-Europeans, in the case of Europe) to start companies easily in their land.",1437822011

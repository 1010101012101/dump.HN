I got a Sony PRS-505 and i got it mainly to save cost on the technical books that become obsolete very quickly.

But if you are viewing a site, why would you even expect to use it without also helping to provide for its upkeep?<p>> Nobody has a right to show me advertising, just as I don't have a right to read someone's content. If publishers have a problem with it they need to find a way to not display content to clients who are blocking ads.<p>Attempts which would be blocked by ABP's author. That would be an arms race.

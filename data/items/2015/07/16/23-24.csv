9900611,comment,9899548,9899548,0,0,jewbacca,,,"For very many habitual users of Reddit, the way in which it is probably most valuable is as the canonical general discussion forum of the web. An important part of the infrastructure of their perception and interpretation of the world around them, for pretty much any domain beyond the most incommunicably personal.<p>To read Reddit can be, in a surprisingly real way, like participating in a collective consciousness -- with all the addictive dependence [I say that in a non-judgemental way, not being able to come up with a less negative way to characterize it at the moment] that the type of speculative fiction which imagines such living arrangements usually predicts.<p>The practical side of this is that, for any given news event, cultural phenomenon, popularly-circulating idea, whatever: for these users it is instinctive to consult the reddit threads on the topic, as a deeply-ingrained part of their process for digesting and interpreting it. That those reddit threads will exist and have an active discussion on any given topic is a given. Even if the local source of a news piece has a forum/thread of its own, it is fundamentally not the same thing.<p>It&#x27;s been, in a hazy golden age that may have never actually existed, something close a total function for processing the events of the world, big and small.<p>One day, there was an event, a dumb internet drama event, but one for which the primary Reddit discussion thread was displaying a count of 20 thousand comments -- but on inspection, every single last one of those was showing up as [deleted]. That was the start of it for most users. Many have fixated on the specific topic of that initial drama as the source of the problem with Reddit, and many others have fixated on this fixation as the source of the problem with Reddit.<p>But there is a general sense that this is growing, spreading, and mutating, and seems to be cropping up in places that are not strictly predictable.<p>For example, there are persistent rumours that several of the more popular subreddits for which the news would be directly and explicitly on-topic, are systematically removing discussions about various global trade agreements currently being negotiated. Is it true? Maybe, maybe not, but the trust is broken.<p>----<p>The main thing is (the perception that):<p>Now there is a partial function where before there was a total function. That is disastrous damage in an information processing system.<p>----<p>To these users, this is a very profound and frightening piece of damage, having extended a part of their cognition into this machinery that now seems to be failing. Panic sets in, which obviously means wild flailing at anything that pops its head up and can be in any way seen as responsible for the damage.<p>Hence, the reaction to Ellen Pao (and what would have been the reaction to Steve Huffman here, had he unilaterally taken a more extreme stance than he has here).  Especially after she made public statements of purpose that were easily interpretable by these users to the effect of &quot;whatever else might be the source of the damage to your extended cognition, we intend to start deliberately doing some more damage to areas we don&#x27;t consider important&quot;.<p>----<p>----<p>Also important to understanding this:<p>To the users I&#x27;m talking about, the &quot;cognitive value&quot; of Reddit is not entirely about directly being fed opinions to take up as one&#x27;s own.<p>Many of these users find great value to being exposed to, they deliberately seek out for their own enrichment: idiocy, malice, counterfactuals, cognitive dissonance, debate (honest and otherwise), the whole range of perceptions and opinions.\nTo them, being exposed to these things is just as much of the value of Reddit as the &quot;good stuff&quot;. And that seems to be the aspect of Reddit most strongly and immediately under threat.<p>Anyone who does not value this kind of experience (which seems to be a very large proportion of the people participating in this conversation at the most visible levels) is going to see any attempt to frame this type of content as valuable in any way as totally incomprehensible, evil, and malicious itself. So this part of things is pretty close to an impossible conversation to have in public.<p>----<p>----<p>(reposting a comment that I&#x27;ve made before, in a thread that was apparently soft-killed on HN)",1437091069

In addition this doesn&#x27;t at all help us delimit the space of all possible constructors.<p>Fundamentally the issue is that constructor theory seems to require us to write down every possible constructor and gives us no way to validate whether they will work, not particularly useful from a theoretical perspective since it is essentially equivalent to having to do an exhaustive search of the space.

We also looked into abstracting that away by building a porcelain UI, but there are a lot of challenges there that are very difficult to overcome.<p>Finally, RethinkDB&#x27;s needs are quite specialized and there isn&#x27;t a service that does what we need out of the box. We looked at implementing Raft ourselves and realized it isn&#x27;t actually hard -- a much bigger challenge is properly architecting the rest of the system. To give you an idea of timing, it took us two weeks to get a Raft implementation, and another few weeks to polish it. It took another year to get everything else working (plus two years of expertise in the field wrt real-world issues that users encounter).<p><i>> only a few seconds of unavailability</i><p>This isn&#x27;t something you can escape in system that&#x27;s based on authoritative replicas.

I dug a bit into their research and it&#x27;s setting off all of my skeptic alarms. Their primary research papers appear to be typeset in Word for christ sake.<p>To nitpick some particular aspects of the theory and article:<p>From the wikipedia article on constructor theory:<p>&quot;Current theories of physics based on quantum mechanics do not adequately explain why some transformations between states of being are possible and some are not. For example a drop of dye can dissolve in water but thermodynamics shows that the reverse transformation, of the dye clumping back together, is not possible. We do not know at a quantum level why this should be so&quot; [1]<p>An egregiously incorrect statement. This is basic statistical mechanics. The dye dropped into a solution diffuses and doesn&#x27;t return back into the original drop is very simple: there are very few configurations of the dye/solution system where the dye is in a concentrated drop and a mind bogglingly large number of configurations where the dye is diffused throughout the solution. Nothing in physical law forbids the formation of a concentrated drop from a diffused solution - it&#x27;s just ridiculously implausibly unlikely.<p>In fact, due to time reversal symmetry we know that the formation of the concentrated drop is explicitly allowed. Here&#x27;s a little gedanken experiment: put a drop of dye in the solution and let it diffuse. After some time t, reverse all of the momenta of all of the atoms in the solution (you are God). At time 2t the dye will reform in the original concentrated droplet. But here&#x27;s the zinger: keep watching and that droplet will again diffuse across the solution! Keep letting the clock run backwards and you&#x27;ll probably never see the drop reform again.<p>One more note on that quote: the last sentence says that this is somehow forbidden by quantum mechanics. Again, this is bogus. Ensembles of large number of particles is the domain of statistical mechanics! Long discussion in of itself but the (semi)classical view is a very useful and valid perspective for many problems!<p>Now a comment about the article:<p>&quot;Here’s where the puzzle arises. Biological replication and self‑reproduction are in fact such stupendously well‑orchestrated physical transformations that one must explain how they are possible under the simple, no‑design laws of physics such as ours. This additional explanation, which was not included in the theory of evolution, is essential for that theory to properly explain how living things arise without intentional design – to close the explanatory gap&quot;<p>1. Absolute bullshit that one needs to &#x27;justify&#x27; how certain physical states that _seem_ improbable are realized. Total garbage. Another core tenet of statistical mechanics is ergodocity [2] which states that ALL states of a system are will eventually be visited (if you have infinite time).<p>2. My major gripe: (non-equilibrium) statistical mechanics accounts can explain the formation of complexity (such as life)!! It is not mysterious or outside of the scope of our current framework!! By analogy consider a pot of water being heated by a hotplate from underneath: if the hot plate is on low the heat will diffuse up through the water in a disorganized manner; but, at some critical temperature convection rolls will form spontaneously in the water. They form because the increase in energy dissipation wins out over the reduction in entropy induced by their formation.<p>This is exactly the mechanism driving the formation of life! The existence of life is not mysterious, it&#x27;s inevitable!<p>This article is complete and utter bullshit.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructor_theory#Motivations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructor_theory#Motivations</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_hypothesis</a>",1437088130

(i.e., design or influence by some entity outside the universe).<p>Furthermore, while it would be stupendously unlikely for an apple pie to arise completely by chance (imagine the odds of all the right atoms just <i>happening</i> to collide in the right way at the right time), it&#x27;s not nearly as unlikely that some kind of self-replicator should arise, and this self-replicator could eventually generate an apple pie, or something of similar complexity.",1437087777

Void is not a real value, whereas unit is (unlike the article states) just a normal value, which supports all the things you can do with values, like assigning/let-binding etc.<p>This is true, but null is effectively at the bottom of the inheritance hierarchy in that it is a valid value for any (pointer) type (in C/C++/Java etc.), while unit cannot be used that way. The relationship between unit and void is that if you were porting a program from an imperative language with void to OCaml, you would generally replace any place where you returned void or took no arguments/void as the argument with unit. Like void it conveys no real information.",1437087704

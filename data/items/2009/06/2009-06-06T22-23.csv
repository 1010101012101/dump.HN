645226,comment,644956,645210,0,0,Hexstream,,,"There's also this macro I wrote that I couldn't live without, I call it <i>fmask</i>.<p>Problem: I always hated that <i>(loop for element in list collect (my-fun element))</i> translates trivially to <i>(mapcar #'my-fun list)</i> but <i>(loop for element in list collect (my-fun element my-constant))</i> doesn't. You'd either have to stick with the loop version or use something ugly and inefficient like <i>(mapcar #'my-fun list (make-list (length list) :initial-element my-constant))</i> or write out the lambda: <i>(mapcar (lambda (element) (my-fun element my-constant)) list)</i> (my-constant could actually be an arbitrary form).<p>None of these solutions appealed to me. So I wrote fmask. With it, the example is simply rewritten as <i>(mapcar (fmask #'my-fun ? (? my-constant)) list)</i><p>Another example:<p><pre><code>  (mapcar (fmask #'list ? (? (1+ (length ?))))

The sad fact is that a tiny tiny percentage of those who grow up in poverty are able to push out of it. Instead of blaming the lack of ""values that extol hard work"", take a look around at broken households, broken schools, broken neighborhoods: high crime, high unemployment, etc. etc.  For every story of a self-made millionaire, you can easily find dozens more who were just as smart and hard working, but were fucked by circumstance. When you're poor, any minor problem becomes catastrophic—a sick relative, losing your job, whatever—and makes you start again from scratch. Someone working two menial jobs straight out of high school to pay the rent month-to-month simply does not have the same economic opportunity as someone from an upper-middle-class family, who can go to college and grad school, etc.<p>> <i>huge part of wealth is determined by intellect.</i><p>Ignoring the huge problems inherent in this idea of ""intellect"" as some quantifiable quality, this isn't close to true.

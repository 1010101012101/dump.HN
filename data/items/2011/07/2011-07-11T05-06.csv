Sometimes we are sad, but mostly we are happy. I dont know to the others if they are happy, this is just my opinion. Mostly of the egelloC stendutS are striving hard to get good grades especially to their terror teachers. They are afraid to get the highest grade which is 5.0, INC or CND, just kidding these are the grades we do not want most. If we get these kinds of grades we will surely suffer. So as a egelloC stendutS we strive hard to get good grades and to achieve our goals in life.<p>All of us as the egelloC stendutS face the biggest challenge in our lives. This is a 2 years, or, 4 years of investment in the tertiary level. We will use these investments to have a good and a stable job in the future. All of the egelloC stendutS wanted to have a better future, to have a family and to help their parents which send them to school to ensure they will have a good future. Our parents are the very good thing we had in our lives. They send us to school and guide us to become good and honest citizens. They are really a very good model for us. They gave us advice so we could learn the right way to live righteously. So the egelloC stendutS are guided properly by the parents.<p>egelloC stendutS had many things done in their college lives sometimes they do stubbornness, and sometimes they do cutting classes. But for me, I do not do those things I focus to my studies and besides that Im good and kind. Being a egelloC stendutS is a very best thing I experience in my whole life. They say that high school life is good, but for me being a egelloC stendutS is a fantastic experience someone could have. This is the life I really want to have forever, I do hope and pray to stay and stick to my college life, but it is utterly impossible I really want to graduate too.<p>Speaking about graduation the egelloC stendutS had the very hard time to accept this truth this is a mixture of happiness and sorrow. For me, this is true we really are happy but the friends we meet and we already loved like a real family will be lost, having their own expenditures in their lives. We would all separate and will start to draw our lives. But, despite of the sorrow we achieve the very best thing, the crown of glory the crown of success this is will be an exchange to the sweat and blood of our parents who strive hard to send us to school.<p>The egelloC stendutS got the gold their dream comes true. They had got the degree they wanted to have and they will have the degree that they could be proud of. This is the life of the egelloC stendutS start big and dream big because someday you will get your success.",1310363423

2749628,comment,2749559,2749559,50,0,mlinsey,,,"We'll see. I agree that Facebook Groups is much less powerful than Circles and much less fundamental to the core Facebook experience than Circles is with G+.<p>On the other hand, Facebook Groups takes less effort to use - each person does not need to sort their friends, a small number of curators can organize the group.  More importantly, it is clearer to the user just what is going on.  I have been trying to talk to as many non-techie non-early-adopters as possible about Circles, and many get it and love it, but several don't really understand it.<p>In particular, the asymmetry of circles is overlooked by a lot of people, even by some casual users who think they understand how Circles works.  On Facebook, there is one authoritative list of who is in the group, and posts to the group stay in that group.  On Google+, your circles are not my circles. I may have you in a ""close friends"" circle, you may have me in a big ""co-workers"" circle, or you might have all your friends in one circle.  When I am browsing my ""close friends"" feed and see a post by you, I may guess wrong about the social context that you are sharing that message in, and make an inappropriate comment, not realizing who else received the message. (The way to determine on G+ who received a post is by noting and clicking on the gray ""Public"" or ""Limited"" in the upper right of the post) Maybe I am underestimating people, or maybe comments are just much less big a deal than posts, but I think this lack of clear social context for individual messages within Circles is going to lead to some serious privacy/sharing accidents.<p>If I had to make a prediction, I'd think that the ease-of-use and clarity of FB Groups will trump the power and flexibility of Circles. I could be wrong, so it'll be interesting to see what ordinary users prefer.",1310363232

I found the main point raised in the article to be very interesting because it supports a view that I arrived to independently, by thinking about why I myself was procrastinating in college (I was a pre-med student and of course I had a heavy course load -- but I never deep down wanted to be a doctor -- my real love was math, technology, computers, and believe it or not philosophy).<p>a) The entire consciousness/unconscious separation is somewhat bogus (our ""unconscious"" is simply the part of our brain that evades introspection, but degree of introspection is hard to measure for obvious reasons). The main point to gather is that there <i>is</i> a process of self-criticism that manifests itself as lack of motivation, at least as stated by the article.<p>b) Our lives are always at risk -- being outcompeted by others of our kind is equivalent to being trampled upon by a mammoth.<p>c) I don't see how lack of motivation to do X is a less efficient alternative to fear. Fear is rarely an efficient mechanism (except in very time-constrained situations) -- it forces us to focus all our energy on a single task, it prevents us from thinking broadly and seeing new opportunities, and finally it forces us to make decisions towards increase of security instead of increase of opportunity. And the ""loss of interest"" you mention is technically the same as lack of motivation.<p>d) It makes perfect sense that we are conflicted about complex decisions for a long time. If we made up our minds quickly instead, it would prevent us from gathering enough information to make the aforementioned complex decision correctly.

Everyone is looking at this problem backwards. I say this because the vast majority of these technologies are javascript based and simply read cookies and execute simple image requests to send information back to tracking servers. If someone was to invent a plugin that allowed these technologies to still function, but randomly scrambled the data being sent (along with sending extra dummy requests here and there), it would be over...<p>Tracking companies rely on clean data, they even report on exact numbers coming out of these systems, so instead of people trying to avoid being part of their clean data, it would be far more effective to make their data dirty so they can't trust it (or sell it).",1310361180

In 2008, a CEO costs 33% of the founder's pool. When the company survives into its first cash-flow-neutral year, that CEO costs much less.<p>The idea that you can just keep peeling 6% (or 40%) every round is also a fallacy. You can keep doing that exactly until the point where your shareholders stop letting you do it.<p>Again: it's really easy to devise an argument that says a YC endorsement is worth 6%. I'm not going there. I'm just asking you to think about the real value of that equity number, and I'm doing that because I think to a lot of people, 6% sounds low. I had less than 2% of a very small company that got acquired in '98, and I ended that year just shy of 7 figures.",1219427769

If python's lambda is castrated, ruby's notion of an anonymous function is tumorous.  We've got blocks, procs, lambdas and methods?  What's the difference?<p>Ruby mixes up the syntactic requirements of ""passing"" some code to a loop to iterate with with the data requirements of binding a function to a scope.

Think Rails, but more lightweight, greater emphasis on scaling and performance, and open to several ORMs (not just ActiveRecord), templating languages (not just ERB), and Javascript libraries.<p>Camping is a Ruby micro-framework that's been around for a while. The framework itself is 4kb, and Camping apps are designed to sit in one file. Used a bit on the side, but not especially widely for production work.<p>Sinatra is a newer microframework that looks similar to web.py, but in Ruby. Looks useful, and I've been meaning to get around to it.<p>The nice thing about Rails, Merb, and Camping is that if you know one, the others will be familiar.

283943,comment,283661,283661,0,0,etal,,,"Some discussion:<p>1. Python's object-oriented syntax makes it tedious to hand-code a complete GUI app. Instantiate a container, add a label, set the label text, add button, add a button -- without special hackmagic (e.g. fussing with __dict__ and __getattr__), it's very repetitive and not particularly readable. Basically, it looks like Java. Special hacks can cut the redundancy, but then, simple GUI layout code shouldn't be that conceptually tricky.<p>When I started using Glade alongside GTK, life improved dramatically. Separating the layout from the controlling methods seems to be part of it, and that works fine in web apps, so it's nicely familiar. But XML sucks for simply storing and retrieving data within an app, and I don't think the layout and logic need to be written in different languages necessarily. XML and HTML work for layout because the code physically looks like the layout it describes -- angle brackets don't matter; parentheses would be fine too.<p>In short, I think the syntax we want for GUI layout should be declarative, not object-oriented. Ruby's blocks make it work for Shoes, and I'm suspicious that converting that style to Python's OOP syntax without understanding the need for a sort of declarative mini-language will lead to... let's say, a confusing and ugly API.<p>2. Is this (a) a library that's either pre-installed on the user's machine or included with the distributed code, (b) a framework that generates code for the target platform during design, or (c) a preprocessor that generates the right platform-specific code before/during packaging?<p>3. I understood that Clutter was the new hotness in GUI creation these days. Any interaction there?",1219426789

This reads like a contrived science fiction story, but it's true (maybe it's just that the science fiction I've read is based on ""alien"" cultures on Earth - like the gaits in ""walking with dinosaurs"" made me think that birds walk like dinosaurs. But they based the gait on birds.).<p><i>> But what if a language didn't show recursion? ... First of all, it would mean that the language is not infinite</i><p>A regular language (like a* b) is infinite, but not recursive --- But he's probably not using a mathematical regular expression, but a Chomsky Hierarchy type-3 regular grammar (like A -> aA, A-> b), which <i>is</i> recursive. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy#The_hierarchy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy#The_hierarchy</a><p><i>> PirahÃ£ doesn't have expressions like ""John's brother's house"" ... you have to say ""John has a brother.

It seems to have the quality of recursion, but at the multi-sentence level.<p><i>> If you go back to the PirahÃ£ language, and you look at the stories that they tell, you do find recursion.

There are typical and non-typical ways for sentences to follow one another - surely that's part of the language.

The lack of recursion in the PirahÃ£ language may probably have a connection to lack of the numeric system (yes, they don't count !!), though the author disagrees with this angle.<p>Some things seem conflicting, though. The author says the language lacks numeric system (which involves recursion) and quantifiers, but the people are involved in trade (Brazil nuts for consumables) with other groups (river traders) and believes that they have been doing so for a long time. Puzzling how they could have done this without quantifying !<p><i>So I don't think that the fact that they lack numbers is attributable to the linguistic determinism associated with Benjamin Lee Whorf, i.e. that language determines our thoughtâI don't really think that goes very far. It also doesn't explain their lack of color words, the simplest kinship system that's ever been documented, the lack of recursion, and the lack of quantifiers, and all of these other properties.</i><p>.....<p><i>The Brazilians the PirahÃ£s most often see have boats, and they just come up the PirahÃ£s' river to buy Brazil nuts. In exchange, they bring machetes, gunpowder, powdered milk, sugar, whiskey and so forth. The PirahÃ£s are usually interested in acquiring these things....They don't accumulate Western goods, but if you've got consumables, the PirahÃ£ might buy, say, two pounds of sugar, pour it in a bowl and eat it all at once. They're not going to put it on the shelf and save it; they'll just eat it when they get it.</i><p>Also, I don't understand the ""they were sent away"" part, in the quote below..<p><i>The crucial thing is that the PirahÃ£ have not borrowed any numbersâand they want to learn to count. They asked me to give them classes in Brazilian numbers, so for eight months I spent an hour every night trying to teach them how to count. And it never got anywhere, except for a few of the children. Some of the children learned to do reasonably well, but as soon as anybody started to perform well, they were sent away from the classes.

Old-school ruby folks (the guys who were ruby gurus when Rails was still an infant) have different characteristics: older, less confrontational, veteran programmers, Matz-like.  A generalization for sure but my impression.<p>The python community has done significant development in science/math so they have stronger libraries in those fields.  Python has had an influx of Railsy people due to Django and might get a shot in the arm from Google App Engine.<p>From a language perspective, I like the wealth of libraries for python.  I like that many reference/experimental applications on web stuff is in python.  The whitespace issue for me has disappeared and I'm actually leaning toward liking it more than ruby's block delimiters.  The template/erb issue can be diffused by looking at HAML.  (That's a cool way of incorporating pythonic indentation to templates.)  Unicode is solid in python.<p>Ruby is a better choice if you like to reshape the language into something that could potentially look un-Ruby.  It's possible I haven't gotten far enough into python yet, but I can see why metaprogramming and DSLs are more prevalent in ruby than python, and it's not just ""one way"" culture.

9050068,comment,9034570,9039700,0,0,rm445,,,"I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the opportunity to teach or lecture. The allure of academia comes from a kind of status, intellectual rather than social. So long as you&#x27;re in the academic world, you&#x27;re on the path of Newton, Gauss or whoever else floats your boat. Out in the world you&#x27;re just making money.<p>The academic world is carefully arranged as a linear sequence which you can progress along but which is halted if you leave. It&#x27;s expected that very little you could do out in the commercial world could aid your academic career, without at least the involvement of a university. At best you can return to the same point along the trail but it may be much harder.<p>The reinforcement begins with undergraduate students. The teaching and particularly grading, hence status, reward those suited for research. (This was particularly evident to me as a mechanical engineering student - the field is broad and empirical, but the examination of my course rewarded nothing but mathematical ability. And of course if you DO fly through the exams, interested professors will be gauging your interest in doing a PhD with them before long and it all clicks into place).<p>As a postgraduate student you will sit underneath portraits of your idols and eat dinners with the academics you&#x27;re encouraged to look up to, be fed anecdotes and inside knowledge. The lecturers and postdocs you meet will be judged by their research ability and are already self-selected for a good mental fit with the system. It&#x27;s universally acknowledged that salaries are higher elsewhere, but leaving would involve abandoning the track of research progression they&#x27;re already entrained with. (It brings to mind the joke about the elephant-deconstipator at the circus who could never contemplate leaving showbiz).<p>I don&#x27;t write any of this with rancour or ill-feeling, nor do I wish to over-egg things and make it seem like indoctrination. More like academia is a successful meme that shares characteristics with other enduring systems. If one wishes to poach from this particular set of people who are highly capable but driven by intellectual status (as well as of course their legitimate intellectual research interest) then one needs to offer them a substitute status.<p>Concrete suggestions to achieve this:<p>- Professional certification. I&#x27;m sure a lot of people here hate the idea but progression towards say being a Chartered Software Engineer might motivate academic types.<p>- Maintain university links. Collaborate with universities, offer secondments, let employees collaborate along their research interests. This isn&#x27;t novel, good research organisations already do this. But it&#x27;s probably rarer for the Silicon Valley &#x27;Twitter for Dogs&#x27; type startups being involved with this sort of thing.<p>- Invent some other kind of new status or proxy for status. My point is that offering enough money to compensate for dropping one&#x27;s academic dreams presumably won&#x27;t work, since such money is already on offer, and PhDs remain predominantly focused on the academic track rather than using their talents elsewhere.",1423933022

In fact every invention comes from tinkering. There&#x27;s no definition of engineering in existence that would preclude software development from being considered authentic engineering.<p>In terms of constraints and fixed boundaries, to suggest software doesn&#x27;t have those is just nonsense. Just try leaving out the curly braces next time you write something in C. Unlike a field such as writing, software does have rules. I can write a misspelled sentence and forgo the rules of grammar and my sentence will still be &quot;compiled&quot; and probably understandable. A book doesn&#x27;t stop working because of a bug. Software certainly does. Thus, there are plenty of fixed boundaries and constraints on our work. The characteristics of steel are analogous to the charactistics or a specific software class.

9050010,comment,9049186,9049186,0,0,omouse,,,"I&#x27;ve changed my mind on estimates; if you&#x27;re giving a guesstimate it&#x27;s your professional responsibility to make it clear that this is a guess and to explain that as you work or investigate the task(s) you will have a better estimate.<p>If you&#x27;re estimating once at the beginning of a sprint and neglecting to update the estimate as you&#x27;re working on the task or as you have new information on the task, you are being unprofessional. It&#x27;s the finer-grained equivalent of your project manager or account manager failing to tell the client or the boss that the project will take longer than expected after re-evaluating risks.<p>At my current job, the CTO is asking for estimates in order to get a project under control. The first estimates at the beginning of our sprints are not fine-grained but as I work on a task I add more information and update the estimate based on what I know. Sometimes the second and third estimate will be a guess as well but at that point there will be some code written (or read/investigated) which makes it easier to do an estimate.<p>Padding estimates is something that I&#x27;m against when you have enough information about the task. If you&#x27;re padding to account for things like meetings or interruptions, don&#x27;t do it, just log how much those are taking and make a note of it and then everyone can see that your estimates are correct (it did take you 5 minutes to do task XYZ) and that meetings and bullshit interruptions are eating up lots of time. A daily standup that takes 30 minutes and then 1hr lunch and a 30min team meeting should be logged against the project but shouldn&#x27;t affect your estimate of the task.<p>I think the issue is that the estimate can be seen, by managers and developers, as the end goal for the task. If you estimate at 2 hrs and you finish in 1 hr you can just get on Hacker News or reddit for an hour. If you estimate 0.5 hrs and it takes 10 hrs, you shouldn&#x27;t be penalized as if you&#x27;re late. Updating task estimates as you gain more information about them gets rid of that issue. If you think that 2 hr estimate was too optimistic, go ahead and update your estimate. You can&#x27;t be held accountable for a guesstimate, you can only be held accountable for the failure or success of doing the task itself.<p>If you don&#x27;t know how long will it take, make it clear to your team, boss or client that this is the case and that you will need some time to research and to estimate.<p>If there&#x27;s a lot of tasks that need to be done, estimating might take half a day or a day as you go through everything. That estimation work <i>needs</i> to happen for any project that has its deadlines already defined (this is frequently the case and why agile can&#x27;t be improperly implemented in most workplaces). Management needs to give you time so that you can do the professional tasks that need to be done. You can&#x27;t fix what you can&#x27;t measure and as time goes on your estimation skills will get better.",1423931609

I use to develop on a Ubuntu machine and having everything running natively, then I started to work from a co-working space, so I setup my Mac with Vagrant, Virtualbox, Ansible (for provision), to run my Django app, and after that I noticed that all my browser calls to the local development server were taking between 1 ~ 5 seconds (with tons of involuntary context switches in the debug toolbar), when they take 300 ms on my Ubuntu machine... I&#x27;ve heard that last Mac os has trouble with DNS, maybe that&#x27;s what it is but I don&#x27;t really know what to do. So as much as I like how clean it is to build a VM and separate it from the rest of your system, the overhead and the network latency is too much for me, I&#x27;ll stick to installing everything with brew and virtualenv locally.",1423930011

Having the same environment in production as you have in dev will help avoid a lot of integration issues and specialized configurations which you have to maintain.

OSX puts a lot of important preferences (keyboard/mouse settings for example) within the user account, so you will end up having a nightmare keeping things in sync and sane. You won&#x27;t be able to rely on a lot of important tools like dropbox or 1password easily. Just stick with 1 user. Use docker or virtualbox/vagrant for stuff you don&#x27;t want to run as your OSX user.<p>Here are some of my tools and tips.<p>- homebrew is great\n- homebrew cask is helpful, too\n- 1password or similar\n- virtualbox can give you clean playgrounds and test environments that match your servers\n- boot2docker is handy for quickly starting and running services like databases without polluting your mac directly too much\n- I also get a lot of use out of vagrant but YMMV\n- I&#x27;ve lately started using project-specific instances of chrome (created with the chrome SSB script).

9049944,comment,9049218,9049521,0,0,falcolas,,,"Windows is, admittedly, a second class citizen for Vagrant. That said, with one install and one config file change, vagrant is as usable on Windows as it is on the Mac. I keep a number of exploratory Vagrant instances on a USB key (just the files, the boxes default to your &quot;home&quot; directory on the machine), and work on them regularly on both a Mac and Windows.<p>A quick google search for &#x27;vagrant windows&#x27; will lead you to one of many blog posts like this one [1], which point out that your Vagrant experience on Windows will be better if you install Git. This places &#x27;ssh&#x27; and &#x27;scp&#x27; on your path, and then everything about Vagrant just works, including vagrant ssh. I still prefer to use PuTTY to connect when on Windows, but that&#x27;s my personal preference.<p>As for the chef re-provisioning, it is more likely an issue with the environment, not Chef of Vagrant. When Vagrant sees that the Chef binaries are already in place, it will note that and continue with the provisioning. Try it again when you have the git command line tools in your path and see if its still an issue.<p>However, these problems are with your Windows setup of Vagrant, not Vagrant itself. Vagrant on a Mac requires no such workaround to get the unix tools in place, and casting your aspersions against Vagrant from your experience on Windows when it works out of the box on a Mac is unfair to the tool.<p>[1] <a href=""https://eamann.com/tech/vagrant-windows/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://eamann.com/tech/vagrant-windows/</a>",1423929662

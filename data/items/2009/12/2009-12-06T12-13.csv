I these spammy days, it's a must. And even more for such popular website.
Anyway I bet this will be fixed in the following days.
Afaik, most captcha system are crackable, and if not, will be in the next few months/year.
Google has been working on a new captcha system: <a href=""http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2009/04/socially-adjusted-captchas.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2009/04/socially-adjusted...</a><p>This is kind of old, I wonder how it has progressed.",1260103766

979469,comment,979078,979412,0,0,kls,,,"I always though a good feature for Photoshop would be a way to select areas of a file and mark them as dynamic content and non image content, that way PS knows what all of the static content ""or template"" is. Then PS could analyze and auto slice the image and generate the template HTML file that you can then go back and add any non image HTML to. As well it wild be nice to be able to define groups on the template so that PS would slice them out separately for items that may be repeated on the page or that may be used on several pages. My thought was that all this could be accomplished by tagging a layer to be ignored for generating the auto slice.",1260103282

When I do, I also find it easier to work in the kitchen... my regular workspace has too much ""fun stuff"" and is distracting.<p>Also, am I the only one who doesn't experience this ""cubicle nightmare"" scenario? I don't listen to inane chatter by coworkers, I'm not overly burdened with meetings - and the ones I do have are productive and enjoyable. Also, I bus/walk to work, so I don't really experience the gas-brake-honk freeway experience either...<p>Oh, and I never, ever get called. I get emailed, people drop by my office, but I think I've gotten less than 5 calls in the past 6 months.<p>Are there others out there like me who find it just fine to work at the office?<p>Also:<p>> We’re commuting instead of computing<p>I disagree with this vehemently. There's nothing wrong with going to work at a physical place - the commuting problem is not solved by making people <i>sit still</i>. It's solved by wide, far-reaching changes in how our society perceives quality of life. It's solved by denser urban centres, surrounded by denser suburbs, and the elimination of the gigantic American backyard. The freeway culture is a direct result of the American obsession with the house, two cars in the garage, and the huge backyard - go look in Asia or Europe, high quality of life without the massive suburban sprawl. We need to get on that train (somewhat literally) or continue to suffer twice daily down the highway.",1260102779
979464,comment,978859,978969,0,0,kls,,,"I don't even use JSP/JSTL, I do straight HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front end now and use a CMS for all of my static templating (by-by tiles). The only thing I use Java for now is RESTful services using JAX-RS. I do use JPA for my data access so for the most part, if I am just doing CRUD, I can generate the JPA class and the RESTful service off of that class without ""writing"" java. It is a far less convoluted stack and is far more efficient at getting work done quickly.",1260102663
979463,comment,979390,979448,0,0,andrewcooke,,,"i work from home, but i keep regular hours and have a desk that i tend to use ""just for work"" (not always; if my personal computing needs more power than my laptop then i need to sit in front of the ""work"" desktop).<p>i like it, but i am something of an anti-social clod.  i can have a nap on my bed after lunch without anyone complaining.  i can do the shopping at lunchtime (we live near shops).  i don't waste time commuting (in fact i cook + wash pots in the time my partner commutes).  i can surf the net as much as i want.  play my music as loud as i want.  have more space and more privacy and better furniture than i have had in any office.<p>but i should also admit additional pressures - i live in s america (chile).  the work culture here is appalling (it's not what you do, but how many hours your boss sees you around for) and the wages low.  by working from home i can do consulting ""internationally"".  i do sometimes consider renting a small office nearby, just to keep work and ""life"" more cleanly separated.  but it seems a lot of expense for little real gain.<p>[edit: while i agree with much of the article, i find the title a bit odd.  i don't want to dedicate my whole life to others, so the ""working week part"" (9 til 5) makes sense to me.  if i nap or surf the web in that time it's because i need a break - that doesn't mean i then have to work more hours to ""make up"".  the idea is that i manage myself better than someone who isn't me could do]",1260102424

979461,comment,978526,978920,0,0,thristian,,,"Some friendly shell-scripting hints!<p>— Quoted strings continue until the close quote, regardless of intervening newlines, tabs or spaces. Your REPOS definition would be more readable without the backslashes and work just as well:<p><pre><code>  REPOS=""
    $HOME/git/repo1
    $HOME/git/repo2
    $HOME/git/repo3
    ""
</code></pre>
— pushd and popd are handy, but are bash extensions and not part of POSIX /bin/sh (and yes, a lot of systems including Ubuntu and Debian have a bare POSIX /bin/sh). Even when they are available, shell error handling can make it difficult to be sure that each pushd has a matching popd. A simpler approach is to just cd in the subshell:<p><pre><code>  sh -c ""cd $REPO; $1""
</code></pre>
— Rather than explicitly invoking the shell you might find it easier to do the same thing with syntax:<p><pre><code>  (
    cd $REPO
    eval ""$1""
  )
</code></pre>
...or, you might find that even less readable. Up to you!",1260101878

This leads to some odd results, e.g. number of arms has low heritability (almost all variation is due to environment).<p>Anyway, language is not heritable.

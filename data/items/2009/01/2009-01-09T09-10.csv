It really is kind of pointless... it's the same thing as a lightbox, only vertical, and more disruptive and disorienting.<p>I do think there could be some use for it... maybe someone will make a twitter app that uses it.. twitslide perhaps.. and we can all be amazed that they did it in x hours just as a side project.",1231493847

It's absolutely imperative that my phone be SSHable, and Vimmable, and doable out ""in the sticks"" when I'm on vacation.<p>And the slide-down keyboard looks amazing.

Twitter is a web of one to many relationships.<p>""Conversations"" on Twitter are much more segmented and have less depth.

You'd have to keep separate cookies per tab, but tabs have no identification for persistence.<p>So you open two gmail accounts, one in each tab.  Close them both.  Open a new gmail tab, which account will you be in?  The logical conclusion is that, in your scenario there are no cookies written to disk.<p>With profiles, each profile has its own set of cookies and you are deliberate with respect to the profile you are in.

8107068,comment,8104083,8105809,2,0,participle,,,"The kind of ebike you&#x27;re recommending is called a mid drive, not a direct drive. Mid drives connect to the bike chain so it combines your bike&#x27;s gears with the motor, that&#x27;s where all that great hill climbing ability comes from.<p>Direct drive is just a regular hub type that sits in the center of the wheel. They&#x27;re not so good since they do not use the bike&#x27;s gears, you end up with cogging when pedaling, it distributes the bike&#x27;s weight unevenly and low power restrictions make it fairly useless for hills. There&#x27;s also geared hubs these days which look similar but work a little better.<p>Course, any of these types are better than the copenhagen wheel.<p>Personally my dream ebike would be a Bosch mid drive connected to a nuvinci internal shifting hub via a gates carbon drive, all mounted on a full suspension carbon fiber frame with the battery mounted in the center triangle.",1406710644

The server easily handles about 500M reqs/month, with negligibly low load average.

Eventually I did ready and it&#x27;s pretty great. It covers how people manage to get work done, which is pretty important for everyone.<p>Last year I read The Swerve: How the World Became Modern by Stephen Greenblatt. It&#x27;s non-fiction, though I believe the central premise is a little tongue in cheek. An ancient Roman manuscript that&#x27;s rediscovered and helps set off the enlightenment and our modern culture.<p>For Buddhism I enjoyed Zen Flesh, Zen Bones by Paul Reps, mainly a collection of translated koans. If you&#x27;ve never it I recommend Godel Escher Bach : An Eternal Golden Braid, as it also likes to play with Buddhism. It&#x27;s a book that tends to get a bit of hate but I found it quite fun and playful.<p>Non-fiction for sci-fi and fantasy: Robin Hobb and Vernor Vinge.",1406710426

There&#x27;s many many ways for a bottled spirit to taste different even if it came from the same distillery.<p>Four Roses uses two different mash bills (i.e. proportion of grains) and five types of yeast to create ten different new make spirits, which they combine in different proportions for each of their products. Bulleit is probably a distinct combination. It may also be aged in a different warehouse or a different part of the same warehouse (which can have a surprisingly large effect). It may be aged in casks with more or less char than the casks used for the Four Roses products. It may be bottled at a different age. The blender also gets to taste all the mature casks and pick and choose which ones get combined to make the final product, and can create a different flavor profile just with that choice.<p>So rest assured, it&#x27;s not just a &quot;re-brand&quot;, even if it came from the same stills.",1406708047

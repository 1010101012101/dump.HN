866833,story,,,5,3,jgrahamc,"Google Wave is the Segway of email",,"So, I received an invite to Google Wave.  Ignoring all the problems inherent in a new service, I'm underwhelmed.  It looks like the application of cool technology to a problem I didn't have.<p>By far the worst part is the IM in the middle of otherwise static data.  I can see how archived conversations all in one place are good, but Wave's busy UI means that I can't keep more than one IM-like conversation going.  That's something I can easily do with any IM client.<p>Also, the watch every character as it's typed is horrible.  Especially when the person on the other end is a poor typist.<p>I can also see how reach editable, email is nice to have.  But I'm not sure trying to put this all together is the answer.  Yes, I like IM with my colleagues for real time stuff.  Yes, I like shared documents.  Yes, I like the store and forward nature of email.<p>But making a single stew out of them all seems like a mistake.<p>Would love to hear HN users' thoughts.",1254927563

While your surgeon example may be a bit contrived, it raises a valid point: Why haven't you ever considered the IQ of your surgeon? Does anyone even know their surgeon's IQ?<p>Investors don't seem to care about IQ at all. It wasn't an issue of public consideration during the last presidential election. If it could reliably predict anything, don't you think more people would ask about it? I'm sure there are places where IQ scores are considered (applying to college or Google), but these are the exception, not the rule.<p>There is generally a difference between people with an IQ of 50 and an IQ of 150. But you don't need a standardized test to see those differences. The problem is that there is very little difference between an IQ of 120 and an IQ of 130. If all IQ is good for is telling the difference between the very intelligent and the learning disabled, then it isn't very useful in daily life.",1254927176

866816,comment,865217,865461,0,0,jerf,,,"No dice. Kolmogorov complexity is critically dependent on the encoding scheme you use for the complexity measure, and given the nature of the problems in question that's going to really not work. If your encoding scheme favors polynomials but makes expression squares a royal pain, you're going to get a radically different K-complexity number than you will if your encoding goes the other way around. And coming up with both such encodings is trivial.<p>This is why proofs using K-complexity (forgive me, I often misspell it) always use it in a way that doesn't involve actually assigning numbers to the K-complexity; while it has certain desirable properties, there is no unique K-complexity value for a given language.<p>Aaaaand it's exactly this reason I also loathe those questions. It is much less ""do this mathematical thing"" than ""read the puzzle-maker's mind"", and quite frequently there is simply literally not enough information in the sequence to read the puzzle-makers mind. With an uncountably infinite number of functions to choose from and a finite set of inputs to choose among them, it's a complete joke of a test. On the other hand, with suitable constraints given in advance it could prove quite useful. (... but that would remove the thrill of lording the answer over people, methinks, which I think is a distressingly large part of such problem's appeal....)",1254927071

That's why Flynn's most recent book gains the praise<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=865429"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=865429</a><p>already mentioned in another reply to this thread.<p>After edit:<p>Because I have Pinker's book at hand, I checked his chapter on the issue, and Pinker says, ""The Third Law: A substantial portion of the variation in complex human behavioral traits is not accounted for by the effects of genes or families."" The environment in the world at large does matter, and it matters for a lot. Pinker is forced to acknowledge this because that is what the research shows. It is regrettable that Pinker fails to cite the articles that establish the difference between heritability and mutability (""malleability"") directly in the text of his book, but I will cite those here. There is a crucial issue here to be curious about, and that is exactly what a calculation of broad heritability definitely predicts. It predicts a lot less than what many readers unfamiliar with genetics might guess. It happens that some of the leading authors on human behavioral genetics just wrote an article about what heritability does and does not mean<p>Johnson, Wendy; Turkheimer, Eric; Gottesman, Irving I.; Bouchard Jr., Thomas (2009).

But I have the full text of the article at hand, as I am currently attending a weekly journal club with some of the authors, and one key paragraph from the article must be read by anyone who draws conclusions from heritablity figures:<p>""Moreover, even highly heritable traits can be strongly manipulated by the environment, so heritability has little if anything to do with controllability. For example, height is on the order of 90% heritable, yet North and South Koreans, who come from the same genetic background, presently differ in average height by a full 6 inches (Pak, 2004; Schwekendiek, 2008).""<p>This simply reemphasizes a point that is familiar to anyone who has studied genetics carefully, namely that the pre-Mendelian concept of heritability says nothing about malleability, the degree to which a trait can be influenced by environmental variables.<p>Angoff, W.

It takes more time.  There are certainly situations where bicycle commuting saves time (see: New York city or the like).  There seem to be far more places where cycling will double or triple your travel time, especially considering the time needed to shower/change at the end.  Which leads me to:<p>2. Lack of shower facilities.  I am lucky enough to be able to shower ofter the ride; many aren't.  Yes, I know the argument of ""you don't need special clothes to bicycle, do it like Denmark, yadda yadda"".  This may be true in Denmark. My area is hilly enough to make you sweat.  Also, if you go fast enough to try to minimize the time issue above, you sweat.  Also, it's not comfortable to me to be biking in my work clothes so I have to change anyway.<p>3. Grooming concerns.  It's not easy for women to put on makeup in the typical work/gym bathroom.  It's also a problem (at least it takes a while) for anyone with longish hair to get it styled after it's been in a helmet or been windblown and/or been washed.

For example, the GWT compiler safely eliminates dead code -- aggressively pruning unused classes, methods, fields, and even method parameters -- to ensure that your compiled script is the smallest it can possibly be. Another example: the GWT compiler selectively inlines methods, eliminating the performance overhead of method calls.""<p>The compiler produces tight and gzip/eternal-cache-friendly JS.  For supported browser type and supported locale in your application, the compiler will generate a permutation specific to that combination and automatically serve that up, e.g. Chinese Webkit users will be served Webkit-optimized code and only the Chinese localizations instead of getting code that contains IE6 hacks and English localizations.<p>There are lots of other benefits - for example, GWT 2.0 will include code splitting, which will allow you to fetch code when you need it instead of a huge monolithic upfront download of your entire application.<p>There are drawbacks to GWT, but going back to ""regular"" web programming feels like dropping into assembler after you've become acclimated to coding in a high-level language.",1254924576

But after having achieved some level of building stuff, the returns are far greater in attractively marketing the stuff you have build versus continuing to build more stuff, on a ROI per-hour-invested basis.<p>I mean, clearly she can build stuff, right?  There's a portfolio.  It has stuff in it.  Achievement Unlocked: Stuff Got Built.  That portfolio could have one extra 100x100 thumbnail that no decisionmaker is going to click on anyway, or, this site could exist.  Do you think the thumbnail will matter more than this site existing?  That strongly does not match my experience with how people approach decisions in the real world.<p>P.S. Takeaway for all engineers in the room: if you have three projects on Github and don't have one of these sites built yet, you will have <i>far</i> better returns on time building a site like this than you will doing another OSS project, and you will have <i>still better</i> returns doing actual networking rather than hoping someone on the Internet will stumble across your hidden potential and give you a shot.",1300948675

What about when you ask yourself why the universe exists?  Do you then stick your fingers in your ears and chant lalala because it is a scientifically intractable question?<p>> <i>In this scientific world, separating and understanding cause and effect is extremely important, it's part of the mission. You call it obsession</i><p>Yes, but let me state unequivocally that you do not need to define yourself by science in order to perform science with integrity.  Such thinking is actually a form of faith: that science is the only source of meaning.<p>> <i>Please realize that not all of us think this way.</i><p>Yes, I was just stating my opinion.  It was clear that you do not think this way.  However I believe you are a critical thinker and that I may at least get you to appreciate why <i>I</i> would see things that way.<p>> <i>For some of us, making stuff up because it somehow resonates with our hearts is the definition of a sad existence.</i><p>You're using ""making stuff up"" in a subtly pejorative way here, but everyone makes stuff up.  Making stuff up is also part and parcel of science.  In fact it is the essence of sentience.  Resonating with your heart is an orthogonal issue which applies equally well to science or philosophical endeavours; we can all be trapped or misled by it.  But the material difference between philosophy and science is that science is only concerned with testable hypotheses.  But are testable hypotheses the only important things in life?<p>> <i>Some of us want to analyze, measure and quantify the universe simply because it is vast and awesome, and revealing the underlying mechanisms of it is extremely rewarding.</i><p>I agree, which I alluded to in my previous reply.<p>> <i>I believe that religious and supernatural world views cheapen much of the nuance, joy and sorrow of the human experience.</i><p>Sure, but so too does pseudo-science cheapen science, or inferior ideas cheapen great ideas.  Don't use religious nuts as a strawman to justify an atheistic hubris that nothing exists beyond what our physical instruments are capable of revealing.<p>In closing, let me state that I don't hold onto any particular belief and use it as a shield against evidence and reason; as no doubt you have witnessed among a certain type of faithful individual and which has shaped your opinion of ""the spiritual world"".  Instead I just take the nature of my own consciousness as evidence that there is something bigger going on here than we can be aware of from within our meatsacks.  This is undeniably a form of faith, because of course there is no firm evidence for such a broad claim; but neither is there evidence against it, and it does not make me hostile to any form of observation and deduction that science can provide us.<p>""The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function."" —F.

I no longer hold that opinion, partly because of my finding out that the same thing that makes chat bots appear ""bot-like"" -- namely, inability to hold deep meaningful conversations beyond cheesy, trite retorts filled with non-specific trivia -- is also what annoys me most when trying to converse with a particular type of people.

Fellow YCnews readers, this may be super obvious to you already...<p>But, WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE THESE COMPANIES DOING?.. spending the resources on developing electronics dedicated to reading books. Same applies to Amazon with the Kindle. Okay, I suppose one could argue (at least in B&N' case) that they are appealing to their specific audience with modern tech. Nevertheless, why would a consumer spend $250+ on a device just to read books? B&N.com, if they really care about their costumers, should put an ad up that says: “We do not recommend spending $250 on a dedicated eReader.”<p>Sure Apple (i.e. iPad/iPad2) offers an eReader... but it's just one of 65,000+ apps.<p>Let’s organize a group and barge into B&N’s next board meeting, explain in plain English where our planet is heading with tech, and help them diversify/liquidate+re-invest in a better model.<p>Sorry (but not really); I felt the need to vent.",1300946894

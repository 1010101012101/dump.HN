If you really felt philanthropic, release some docs on the hardware interfaces.<p>This way Linux / *BSD / Haiku / whatever could be ported and extend the usable life of the device. This would foster a thriving second hand market, massively reduce the security risks that users of the older devices are exposed to, help clear old stock, keep devices out of landfills and so on.<p>Apple has already said they don't support the device anymore, so they have nothing to lose by opening it up (if we accept that the reason Apple locks down their bootloaders etc is to ease the burden of support from people breaking their own devices, not an argument I entirely buy...).",1349045941

4594526,comment,4594089,4594325,2,0,freditup,,,"My thoughts too. It seems logical to suggest that TDD would reduce the number of bugs in the product that's being tested, at least somewhat. However, the true question may be if the time spent writing those tests (longer that the time spent writing code?) is worth it when looking at the number of problems it prevented.<p>I believe the practicality of TDD depends on too many factors to make statements about it in general. Is your project well defined (good for TDD) or a cool little idea that changes and morphs every day or two (bad for TDD). Is it large scale and complex (good for TDD) or quite simple (TDD may be a waste of time here). There are more factors of course too.",1349045907

The reason to do this was so that you could choose a venue that was patent unfriendly and therefore gave you better odds of overturning the patent.<p>Consider the fact that these lawsuits were filed preemptively (they had to be filed before the patent was used to sue you, else you would not get to choose venue), and that they would be filed on the weakest possible patents.  One would expect the patent holder to lose a very large portion of these.<p>I would suspect that a lot of the 80% of wins right after CAFC was due to these cases reaching the CAFC, and it asserting its power over lower courts.<p>The long-term slide since then is undoubtably due to people pushing the envelope as fast and hard as they can on how bad patents can be, and how broadly patent law can be filed in novel areas (ie ones that Congress never meant it to be applied in).<p>There were obvious issues in the pre-CAFC era, but I'd prefer those issues over the current status quo.",1349045906

For a few reasons:<p>- The later you raise money the more data and knowledge you have to validate what you're doing.<p>- There's less risk involved. You know you can work well with your team. I personally want to pay back my investors 10x or more so raising money with an idea and either failing or selling to Facebook for $2M isn't appealing. You can be far more flexible.<p>- You can get better investors interested. The best investors look for people that don't need their money and have something to show. Traction, revenue or validation.<p>- You can raise money at a better valuation. Admittedly some companies need the money to build your company but the longer you hold out, the longer you're worth. If not you're probably doing something wrong. This means you also have more leverage and control of your company through bad times.<p>If you aren't succeeding and need to raise money at a low valuation the chances are things won't get better quickly and as you won't have control of your company.

Trains have rails, airplanes have a nice bit of tarmac and bikes should have a space tailored to their specific needs as well. Typically in the Netherlands, bikes are banned from roads that are 50km/h and up. And they don't need to battle it out with fast traffic, for there are bike lanes. And the limited space in this country means that something truly has to give when adding them.<p>This how the dutch design an intersection. Note the absence of the ridiculous ASL boxes, and most important, no crossing of lanes. \n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlApbxLz6pA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlApbxLz6pA</a><p>- Traffic laws that protect the weaker participant in traffic. Again, case in point, the Netherlands where in a (civil) dispute after a bike-car accident the burden of proof lies with the car. Not to mention the dreaded article 5 that broadly states that endangering traffic is a felony.<p>This helmet discussion imho is just a way to deviate from arguably more costly and difficult choices when it comes to embracing the bicycle. And while we are are at it. I am convinced that making helmets, 4 point harnesses and leathers mandatory in cars for all occupants would save lives as well.<p>What perhaps surprises me the most in the car-bike entanglement is the seemingly bad engineering.

There are quite literally an infinite number of numbers. Why should Graham's be important enough for us to consider. For that matter, why should we consider 1?<p>The answer lies in part in the question - why - it must be important in some way. That is exactly the case - we only consider numbers that, for some reason, relate to problems we are facing, whether it be in mathematics, programming, or grocery shopping, and even then not on their own merits. Past a certain point, you don't hold numbers in your head as little balls, but rather their decimal encoding. That's a clever hack, but not without its downsides. Ask some people randomly if they were in a position to decide, how much budget would they allocate to save 10000 birds, and ask others the same with 100000 birds. The mean of the second answer would not be ten times that of the first (unless your subjects know and actively try to work around that particular bias).<p>But back to Graham's number - if you think the only way to imagine it is to hold its decimal notation in your head - the obvious question is why? Why not hexadecimal? Octal? Why any base-p encoding at all? The usual reason to use base-10 is to quickly get an idea of the magnitude of a number relative to things we are familiar with and do some simple arithmetical manipulations on it. Both of these are pointless for Graham's number. Relative to familiar things like billions and trillions it's quite a ways of the chart, and adding, subtracting, or even raising to powers of such makes relatively no difference.<p>Besides which, in this case it isn't really pointless, it's impossible. Jokes about collapsing into black holes aside, there aren't enough bits of information in the universe to encode the decimal representation of Graham's number. There aren't enough bits of information to encode the number of digits of that. Not enough even to encode the number of digits of the number of digits. Interestingly, there also aren't enough bits to encode the number of times you'll have to repeat taking the base-10 logarithm to get back to a universal scale.<p>Which goes to show that not only your mind, but no entity in the universe can accomplish the feat of representing an arbitrary number in decimal notation, mathematician or otherwise. And what is the point, really? G is a perfectly good symbol, and so is g_64. Usefulness is important, not imagining a string of balls. For that matter, I bet you've been perfectly content to use Pi on at least a few occasions, even though in terms of representability in decimal, it is infinitely worse than Graham's number.",1349042711

The infrastructure is certainly nice but the main thing that makes it great is that there are so many bicycles that they run the streets. Cars are second class citizens and just have to drive slow and wait a lot. Safety in numbers. It's very similar in Vietnam with motorbikes (electric scooters). They do whatever they want, because there are so many of them, and the cars just have to wait.<p>I see a pretty decent number of bikes riding around near where I live in Mountain View but I'm scared for them. They are always riding solo and surrounded by cars who may or may not even be aware they are there.",1349042409

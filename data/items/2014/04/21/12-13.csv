Nginx is in a similar position.<p>That said, the more sysadmins rely on <s>rotten</s>well-proven &quot;Enterprise Linuxes&quot; and &quot;LTS&quot; versions with old libraries and servers, the more security expertise is required from sysadmins to decide where to deviate from the distros default packages to meet current best practices.<p>On the other hand, security is a moving target and knowing your (Open)SSL setup is as important as e.g. knowing your RoR setup.

EMV readers are not cheap. They must be certified, and are far more complex. I was in an Apple Store in London a few days ago and they were selling PayPal branded EMV readers for about $150.<p>Even if we assume a very healthy markup on that price, given the margins Square is on they cannot afford to give away a reader that would cost them ~$50 to produce. It changes their entire business model. Square have offered no indication of how they plan to support EMV cards once they become widespread in the US (which <i>will</i> eventually happen), other than &#x27;you can still swipe the magstripe&#x27;, which whilst true also usually means the fraud liability remains with the retailer, rather than the bank.",1398081974

I think 2s is a bit of a low estimate ;)<p>Seriously though, I don&#x27;t think the Conversation needs to end there (conversation with a capital C - ours can end whenever we want). I do indeed believe in &#x27;mystery above all&#x27;. I actually think that&#x27;s a lovely way of putting it. Because mysteries are just unknowns, and without unknowns, what happens to scientific exploration? Do we just assume we know everything?  And then the exploration stops. I&#x27;ll be more explicit than that as well - I believe in God, and I am somewhat religious. I don&#x27;t think that cancels me out of any interesting conversations.<p>I think you&#x27;re making an assumption when you say that if you hold scientific definitions true then there is no reason why it won&#x27;t be reached. Science says nothing about the future certainty. It is composed of models whose intent is to reflect reality, testable hypotheses to build and refine those models, and the results of the tests of those hypotheses to validate or disprove the hypotheses. We have no model (other than some vague calculations of processing power of the brain), no testable hypotheses and no results for these projections. It&#x27;s not science.<p>But I would say I&#x27;ve proven you wrong that this isn&#x27;t a good conversation!",1398081889

The <i>number one</i> field problem is moisture damage to the electronics.  Condensation, UV failure of seals, ice expansion through seals, etc.  The list goes on.  Based on the moss on the trees in the photo, it looks like a pretty wet environment, so you&#x27;ll want to double-triple-quadruple seal that case and sensors before you think about leaving it outside for more than a month or two.<p>For comparison, we had some customers that had had our units in continuous use for nearly 10 years.  Battery life on 3xAA alkaline was about 60 months using the IR sensor.

7729905,comment,7726615,7727482,1,0,saurik,,,"&quot;Insurance&quot; is a form of risk mitigation. The reality of bandwidth is that we <i>know</i> someone who likes using FaceTime, or who has a Netflix subscription, is going to use more bandwidth than someone else. Sure: it makes sense if you aren&#x27;t certain how large a web page will be to buy insurance on it, but you don&#x27;t want to be in the same insurance bracket as a true &quot;heavy user&quot;: I am happy to take part in a pool where everyone subsidizes the risk of accidental trauma, but I <i>know</i> someone who insists on smoking is going to increase their health costs, and they should be forced to take on that increased burden. This is especially evident when the playing field changes: the cost of insurance for all users goes up dramatically when something like FaceTime or Netflix is released, because the people using it are using dramatically more bandwidth than the people who aren&#x27;t. If the bandwidth companies said &quot;ok, thanks to Apple&#x27;s FaceTime service, everyone&#x27;s connection is now twice as expensive <i>even if you don&#x27;t own Apple hardware</i>&quot;, people would be pissed. This is why insurance charges people differently for their inherent risk, and why you can&#x27;t use insurance as a metaphor here (well, unless you want to make the opposite argument ;P).",1399840866

7729903,comment,7726923,7726923,0,0,blisterpeanuts,,,"What a strange article to feature on Hacker News, front page two days running.  Written by a kid just out of college, with little or no life experience, no legal expertise, and quoting biased sources like a liability lawyer to make his rather whimsical case about &quot;eroding the 7th Amendment&quot;.<p>It sparked a tiresomely predictable debate about hot coffee, as happens every time this case comes up; there are always a couple thousand reader comments ranging from &quot;She was stupid&quot; to &quot;McD&#x27;s coffee is too hot, she deserved more money&quot;.  I&#x27;ve read a lot of them and it does get repetitive.<p>As I see it, the Liebeck incident was unfortunate and tragic but does not represent a trend. This hapless woman appears to have been manipulated by an angry family into hiring a lawyer and blowing this up into a big case that took on a life of its own and caused her to be reviled by advocates of tort reform as a classic example of the legal system run amok.  Others hailed her as  a hero for the little people sticking it to the big bad corporation.<p>Yet, considering that McDonald&#x27;s sells 10 million or so cups of coffee a day, 70 reports of coffee scalding a year seems like edge cases.  Could it not be simply that there are 70 careless people a year?  Much easier to believe than that somehow the coffee is leaping out of its cup and scalding innocent customers about 6 times a month, and they each should get $2.4 million from Mickey D&#x27;s which after all is a giant corporation so &quot;they can afford it&quot;.<p>Now every damn cup of coffee I buy comes with a little warning &quot;Caution!  The drink you are about to enjoy is very hot!&quot;  Well, hell yes it better be hot.  I asked for hot coffee, and the hotter the better.<p>Once, in a coffee shop in Harvard Square, Cambridge Mass., a stupid young waitress managed to dump a decanter of very hot coffee onto my lap off the tray she was carrying.  I got burned on the thigh very close to my genitals, it hurt, it blistered.  I got over it.  They didn&#x27;t charge me for the coffee.  Life went on.  That&#x27;s a case where it truly was &quot;their fault&quot;.  But I didn&#x27;t sue them or anything.<p>I think in my case they could have apologized a bit more profusely, but then again, they don&#x27;t apologize anymore because they figure that&#x27;s an admission of guilt that you&#x27;ll use against them in court.  That&#x27;s why Pennsylvania recently passed an apology law for doctors.  Yes, they have a law now saying it&#x27;s OK for docs to apologize without fear of lawsuit.  The tort lawyers opposed the law.  What a twisted world we live in!",1399840827

You can even stay within this range while being unhealthy because height is by no means a perfect or even a good measure of health. It&#x27;s a very loose measure only in rather extreme situations, and a decent measure for whole populations under some circumstances. It is a proven fact that you can <i>unhealthily push someone&#x27;s growth during childhood</i>.<p>Completeness of nutrition is mostly a non-factor across the Western World when it comes to height. Exercise is a bigger factor as many kids slow down their metabolism by lack of exercise. Migration of Mexicans and Asians into the US is a bigger factor too. These people are healthy, they are just typically shorter. There is no problem at all with that in itself.<p>Albert Einstein was average Ashkenazi jewish at 5 ft 8~9.

7729883,comment,7726615,7727982,2,0,saurik,,,"Usage during peak times is already discouraged by the network degrading during peak times: rather than charge more you simply get less value, which is equivalent. This causes traffic to naturally smooth out some over time. You thereby in fact do need some way to cut back on the total usage, as a bunch of people randomly using Netflix really does cost more than a bunch of people randomly browsing the web. The goal of the network is not to support the peak load: this seems to be a key misconception in these arguments :/. It just isn&#x27;t economically efficient to build a system that can support the peak load. If people really do want to have a system that can stream Netflix to everyone&#x27;s house at 7pm when the traffic throughout the rest of the day is nothing like that amount, then someone has to bear those costs: either Netflix needs to subsidize the weird bandwidth requirement, customers need to opt in to &quot;supports Netflix&quot; plans, or we have to give up entirely on pricing models that don&#x27;t take into account usage <i>in some way</i>.

It had vector processing. That&#x27;s the most trivial kind of computational parallelism (at least from a mathematical point of view) and the Cray-1 had it! Cray not only &quot;bothered&quot; with parallelism, <i>his supercomputers were as parallel as they can get</i>.<p>However, that wasn&#x27;t new. There had been vector machines before, like CDC&#x27;s STAR-100. However, one of the reason why they failed to gain traction was precisely the fact they sacrificed serial performance for that. Turns out that&#x27;s a really bad, bad, bad idea for scientific computing, because 90% of the problems that involve cranking matrices usually involve cranking <i>the same</i> matrices over and over again.<p>So &quot;the best performance possible at the time&quot; (much like today, ironically!) turned out to require not only the parallel processing facilities offered by vector instructions, but also good serial performance, which basically boiled down to SQUEEZE MOAR CYCLES!! Remember, this was still five years before RISC became a thing; it was around the time Cocke began designing the IBM 801 (which only became available in 1980!).<p>At the time, CMOS simply wasn&#x27;t up to it in that regard. It&#x27;s not that Cray made a conscious choice to avoid wrestling with CMOS&#x27; limitations, there were literally no CMOS logic ICs that moved that fast. Not using CMOS was not a design decision anymore than not using relays was! This was happening at a time when pretty much <i>all</i> serious computing was done with bipolar logic. This was still a good two years away from even the faster companies in the same field (like DEC) abandoned the bipolar logic boat. IBM continued building mainframes with bipolar logic (albeit using TTL, not ECL) well after that (the 4300 was retired in the early 1990s, although I don&#x27;t know if they were still manufacturing it in TTL; but it definitely was in 1979 when it was introduced!).<p>When CMOS was adopted later on for high-performance computing later on, it wasn&#x27;t because of the costs! ECL&#x27;s power dissipation demands made it technically, not economically, unfeasible to make faster logic circuits.",1399840098

7729822,comment,7728692,7729698,2,0,JoshTriplett,,,"A few examples, off the top of my head:<p>Socket activation (and related features like bus activation) are one of systemd&#x27;s key improvements to the boot process.  Activation avoids the need for explicit dependencies, because you don&#x27;t need to depend on avahi to start using the avahi socket.  And because of that, systemd can launch avahi and services using avahi in parallel, by opening the socket for avahi, and letting other services write to that socket before avahi fully starts, only blocking when they go to read from it.<p>You <i>could</i> do that with inetd or similar, but inetd doesn&#x27;t integrate with the init system, so an inetd service can&#x27;t declare any dependencies on other services, and won&#x27;t get tracked alongside other services (e.g. with systemctl status).  So in practice, very few distributions actually launched services from inetd in practice (notable exception: CUPS), while many distributions use systemd&#x27;s socket activation.<p>People care about booting quickly.  While mechanisms like bootchart existed before systemd, you had to explicitly boot with them to collect results for analysis, and they&#x27;d slow down the boot process.  With systemd, you can run &quot;systemd-analyze blame&quot; or &quot;systemd-analyze critical-chain&quot; on a production system and see exactly what you need to work on to make the system boot faster.  (That was one of the widely lauded features of DTrace: you could safely use it to diagnose production systems.)<p>Then there&#x27;s journald&#x27;s original reason for existence: &quot;how can we make &#x27;systemctl status&#x27; show the last few lines of log output from a service?&quot;.  How would you do that on an <i>arbitrary</i> system running an <i>arbitrary</i> syslog implementation?  (For extra bonus difficulty, do so while attempting to track the syslog implementation as a service itself, and avoid deadlocks.)  Sure, you could recreate that functionality on a particular system with a particular logging configuration, and there are dozens of systems doing so, not counting the myriad production systems deployed with bespoke solutions for log monitoring.  (Even then, most of those systems don&#x27;t correlate a service&#x27;s log output with that service.)  But systemd makes it easy and universal.<p>And that integration extends beyond systemd as well.  For instance, if fixing a problem requires adding a new kernel interface, they&#x27;ll submit a kernel patch, and then have systemd use that new kernel interface, rather than hacking around the problem in systemd and producing a suboptimal solution.",1399839411

It creates a decentralized system of autonomous channels. A community of thriving subcommunities, a marketplace of ideas where distribution maintainers are free to pick from a variety of flavors for their distros.<p><i>And personally, I wouldn&#x27;t mind seeing Linux distributions learn something about organization from the BSDs, not least of which by requiring that all packages appear in the same version control system side-by-side on the same server.</i><p>So essentially you want a ports system? I have nothing against ports collections, but packaging models that involve strict separation of duties are not bad, either.<p><i>systemd refuses to work around bugs in other software unless absolutely necessary; when that software is FOSS, it can be fixed rather than worked around.</i><p>Yet evidently systemd cannot apply these same principles to itself.<p><i>logind needs cgroups. PID 1 needs to manage cgroups. There&#x27;s a solution that works today, providing features that desktop environments need, for which alternatives do not yet exist.

You&#x27;re using the premise to justify itself.<p><i>Yes, the systemd team is trying to make large-scale changes to the way Linux works. That necessarily puts them at odds with the way Linux currently works. That doesn&#x27;t make them wrong: Linux is not yet perfect and could use further improvement.

7729780,comment,7728086,7728086,7,0,lifeofanalysis,,,"There is obvious up trending of terms like &#x27;big data&#x27;, &#x27;predictive analytics&#x27; and &#x27;data mining&#x27;. I have worked in this area since 1998. So here are a few thoughts:<p>- Good analytics (I&#x27;ll combine the three terms into &#x27;analytics&#x27; for the sake of simplicity) requires an understanding of the tools, as well as a significant understanding of statistics so that you know which analysis to pick. But in addition, it requires a lot of creativity (see my examples below) and a significant amount of time to analyze/slice/dice data in a zillion different ways.<p>- This is a huge opportunity. Much, much bigger than people realize and much bigger than past trends of new technologies like client-server in early nineties or web apps of 4-5 years back. Why? Because it has the power to affect business processes very powerfully.<p>- Example 1: I spent 10 months working for a $5B shipping company analyzing data from their Marketing department. I combined it with several hundred global data sources. I worked on over 100 hypotheses. At the end of it, I came up three specific actions that their existing customers take about 6 months before going to a competitor. The Marketing department was thrilled. They spent $17 Million coming with a plan to tackle this. It has been a few months since then; and they have not lost a single customer. This is a powerful proprietary competitive weapon for them now.<p>- Example 2: I analyzed 10 years of power meter reading data for a large utility company. I combined it publicly available data sources of power consumption of major appliances and census data on family composition/wealth for various neighborhoods. I was able to reliably predict the lifestyle of every family, down to whether the person living in the house streamed a movie on Friday evenings and a whole lot more. So the company decided to use this analysis to change their Direct Mailers with very specific, personalized offerings. Their response to the first test mailer sent to 10,000 people? Twenty seven percent!!! They predict that a significant portion of their profits would come from DM&#x27;s.",1399838886

In this &#x27;big data hiring&#x27; future companies still need to compete for talent. Companies which hire on the basis of arbitrary factors like political views, porn habits, family infighting risk losing talent to competitors. There are incentives to find the right factors of a good employee, just like there are today. In fact a lot of these concerns can happen with the human interview process today.<p>The algorithm to hire people in this future is a competitive asset of a company and they would spend lots of time & money to narrow down the actual important factors. I highly doubt companies would just all settle on the same algorithm given the incentives to compete.<p>Also if you are concerned about this info impacting employment, just don&#x27;t post it online.

192953,story,,,8,10,b3eck,"Ask HN: Have you used iptables to prevent procrastination?",,"After reading the comments on today's Disconnecting Distraction essay by PG (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=192654), I realized that I wanted to throttle my internet usage, not relegate it to a few times during the day.  That way, I could still spend some time online, but the ""Unable to connect"" page would set off alarms.  Is there anyone out there who uses iptables to prevent procrastination?<p>Not having used iptables before, but knowing that I wasn't blocking anything because I'm behind a router firewall, I read the man page and implemented some rules that throttled my hourly connections to 200:<p><pre><code>  iptables -A OUTPUT -p ! tcp -j ACCEPT\n  iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport ! 80 -j ACCEPT\n  iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m limit --limit 400/hour --limit-burst 500 -j ACCEPT\n  iptables -A OUTPUT -j REJECT\n</code></pre>\nSurprisingly, after implementing these commands, I searched on Google and didn't find any mentions of iptables preventing procrastination.  Surely I'm not the only one to have thought of this idea, but it didn't feel right to comment this late on the original article and not help anyone.  It's helped me significantly so far, and even made submitting this question a bit tricky.  So, hopefully these commands help someone else, and if you have better rules, feel free to share...",1211061492

192945,comment,192742,192914,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"As far as I know, the cost is determined by the process and the quantity.  Screen-printed shirts start out expensive, because you have to make one screen for every color (at $60-$180 per screen, I seem to recall, though it's been a year or more since I last got shirts), but get cheaper as the quantities increase because the screen is good for hundreds or thousands of shirts and it's really fast to do.  The lifetime of screen printed shirts is much longer than the inkjet style printed shirts, I believe, as well.  But, realistically, I'm not sure how precise screens can get--really intricate designs are out of reach of that process, I guess (I dunno, all my shirts are two color).<p>I believe there is a new multi-color process (a few years old, which is bleeding edge in the print industry) that apparently does high color prints at high speed, but I don't know how many providers actually have such a machine, or if the costs are competitive with screen printing.<p>I'd be curious who prints the shirts for the Mozilla Foundation.  I love my Firefox shirt.  It looks great, has at least four or five colors, and has held up well.",1211060952

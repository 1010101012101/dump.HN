It also required resource use in such a way to sigificantly alter the natural environment and, in some scenarios, significantly threaten our survivability.<p>I've no idea if there's other worlds out there capable of supporting advanced multicellular life (though it seems far from impossible). I've no idea if any of them are presently inhabited with such life.

Doing a git checkout -b new-branch-for-this-bit-of-code is quick and painless if you want to stage things while you're working, doesn't change anything since you're creating a new branch from your current point, and gives you much easier logging, diffing and merging capabilities later on. This is one of the recommended workflows for git, in fact.<p>You can also commit parts then stash the rest, test, pop the stash, commit more, stash, test, etc, etc. You can add things to commits with --amend, so you can tweak them if you notice something is missing after you added things with git add -p and then commited. I do this a lot when I want to split a commit and use git add -p.<p>If you really want to test things from somewhere else, use git new-workdir to create a new working dir based off your local clone. Whatever you stash or commit to one, the other will see, since they're really pointing to the same local git clone (if you look at the .git/ dir of a workdir, you'll notice it's all symlinks to the original clone). Just make sure every local workdir you create like this is on a different branch, otherwise it will get confused when you change things on one side (because, of course, they're all pointing to the same local clone, but suddenly the local files won't match). I use this to have a ""test workdir"", which is based on a clean and permanently updated branch, where I cherry-pick/merge from the work branch into it, build and test, without having to stash on my work branch, reconfigure things and otherwise stop the coding workflow.",1297950834

We are however kind of stuck with our traffic strategy.<p>Dating being a kind-of-but-getting-better-taboo topic, we don't think that word of mouth will be such a big driver, nor share-to-twitter/share-to-facebook as these have the same problem (do you want the fact that you are trying online dating posted all over your facebook wall?).<p>We think that these sites mostly get traffic through search or advertising. The latter is out of the question for us as we cannot afford to (apart from some guerrilla marketing). And getting a good spot for the dating keyword seems insanely hard.<p>Additionally there is the question of a subscription service. Starting of with a site that requires payment up-front sounds like a traffic-killer.

The <i>users</i> of Pirate Bay may be sticking it to the man or whatnot, but it's just another marketplace -- albeit one with much cheaper entry and transaction costs.

Yes, there may only be 100 people who start all the torrents, <i>but the 100 people are not the cause of the torrents</i>, they're just the statistical artifact of having a marketplace in which certain behaviors are rewarded more than others. Take away those specific 100, and a new group would form.

There is nothing unethical about that.<p>Also, there is no such thing as user rights. The only right a user has is to sue Apple if he/she thinks Apple is in violation of its explicit written contract with any individual user. Before purchasing an Apple device, a customer knows that he/she may be ""locked"" out of the device, but he/she buys it anyways. A user knows all the conditions before the purchase. Apple does not guarantee that after you buy a device they will always provide a great variety of apps at a price you find acceptable. Apple does not guarantee a wonderful service, it does not guarantee great partnerships with developers, it does not even guarantee that it will be in business in a few months. All of that is perfectly clear to anyone who buys a device in almost any market.<p>Apple also has no obligation whatsoever to help any of its competitors innovate. If they cannot ""innovate"" without Apple, it is their problem to solve, they have to be smarter and more resourceful, create something on their own or convince Apple to work with them by demonstrating a compelling product.

I believe the situation would have been totally different if Apple has these 30% rules and things long before iOS becomes the leading platform, when developers has the choice what and what not offer, and they can decide whether they invest or not.

They have invested talents, and have definitely helped co-promote the iOS in one way or the other and created a solid user base. This bomb is understandably very very unpleasant to them.

Really?<p>I switched to Chrome because of 3 major things:<p>1) I can open and close it at least 3 times in the time that it takes Firefox to open. If a Firefox extension needs updates, then it's more like 12 times.<p>2) I had to occasionally open all of my bookmarks from a folder (15 or so). Doing this in Firefox would take something like 15 minutes, and most of the tabs would just fail. Chrome would do it nearly instantly, and act like it was no big deal.<p>3) The newer Firefoxes completely broke the shift-reload to clear the cache option. I still haven't found a decent way to force a complete fresh page load in Firefox 3.5+, which means it's a nearly useless for development. Chrome works great this way, and Firefox used to, but now Firefox creates a duplicate tab instead with the same shortcut? Wha? (I'm not actually sure which version of Firefox broke this)<p>Combine this with things like the fact that Chrome will let you have a regular session PLUS one or more Incognito sessions (extremely useful for developing websites with login or other state, or even just for keeping two different GMails open), or that the default tab behavior in Firefox has always been pretty weak, and Firefox just has a long way to go to win me back.<p>It makes me sad, because all things being equal, I'd rather support Mozilla than Google any day.",1297949641

I agree this tool is useful in checking /testing licensing schemes, and as i am in the process of completing the development of a dual key encryption system for windows apps (web apps later maybe), i will find this tool very useful, however, the software business in my opinion is ultimately about the total cost of delivering the app/data to the end user. Cloud computing probably is the main platform for future apps as the platforms for delivery are so diverse, windows, mac, linux mobile ... but keep in mind, total cost of cloud computing could rise, and there are some apps which have to be run locally for any number of reasons ...",1297947973

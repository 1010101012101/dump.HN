3367446,comment,3366268,3367146,6,0,wtallis,,,"What's changed is the definition of GPU. 15 years ago, the most programmability a GPU had was a few registers to switch between a handful of hardcoded modes of operation. For the past several years, GPUs have been something like 80% composed of Turing-complete processors that can run arbitrary software, and they've more recently gained features like a unified address space with the host CPU, and the ability to partition the array of vector processors to run more than one piece of code at the same time. These features are 100% irrelevant to realtime 3d rendering.<p>GPU architectures don't exactly resemble FPGAs when viewed up close, but for the right kind of problem, an application programmer can now deal with a GPU in the same manner as an FPGA. (In fact, with OpenCL, you can use the exact same APIs.)",1324241813

It's harder than many industry programming jobs (which is not only better job preparation, it's also strong incentive to find a position that isn't seen as boring, i.e., one that pushes you).<p>Draw your own conclusions, but I'd suggest speaking to a CS graduate from Berkeley EECS, Stanford, Harvey-Mudd, CMU, University of Washington, UWaterloo, et al about what their program was like.<p>[Disclosure: I didn't attend such a program myself and I turned out okay. However, have I had a chance to do it over again, I'd have attended one of the above mentioned programs -- not because I'd be in a different spot professionally, but because that experience is intrinsically valuable.]",1324239198

3367360,comment,3365742,3367274,2,0,wycats,,,"blocks may map onto function passing in JavaScript at a high level, but they also do some things that are different in important ways.<p>Most notably, all code in Ruby blocks, including return, super, and yield, execute as if in the original context. This means that you can return from inside a block, and it will return from the original method the block was created in.<p>This is especially useful for custom iterators. In contrast, code inside a ""built-in iterator"" (for and while loops) in JavaScript is executed in the original scope, while code in a custom iterator (forEach, map, etc) is executed in a new scope.<p>This makes custom iterators in JavaScript clumsier to use than the same in Ruby. ES6 adds a way to implement custom iteration in JavaScript that hooks into the for construct, but the benefit of this feature is not limited to iterators.<p>Further, the new JavaScript iterators cannot be used to implement functionality like map and reduce (take a look at Ruby's Enumerable module for other examples), they essentially hardcode a forEach construct into the language, which is useful, but is not the same.<p>Edit: Just to be clear, the point of this comment is to illustrate that even in a case like functions/blocks, the mapping that people do can stick them in the idiomatic mindset of another language. Ruby's compliance with Tennet's correspondence principle (x ~ lambda x) creates many new opportunities for block use that may be missed by people familiar with function passing in a non-correspondence language like JavaScript.",1324239069

The majority of people in any given discussion are not discussing the current version. If there concerns are addressed in the current version, and you try to tell them that, you run a good chance of getting voted way down, because they saw some article by someone famous that said the bill was bad and they can't seem to grasp the concept that the article was written about an older version of the bill.<p>Congress deals with many deep and complicated issues. It is simply not possible for most citizens to competently decide how to vote on most bills. They have neither the background nor the time.<p>Under your system it would basically come down to a popularity contest among the proponents and opponents of a particular bill. People would simply look at who is for and against it, and go with which group fits in better with them. E.g., if Rush Limbaugh says it is bad, you'd have a large group of Limbaugh fans voting against it with no further analysis. If Glen Greenwald says it is good, a bunch of his fans will vote for it with no further analysis.<p>Advertising would also play a large amount in determining the outcome. You can already see this in states that allow initiatives to create legislation directly, bypassing the legislature. The outcome of initiatives if often heavily influenced by whether or not one side can significantly outspend the other on advertising.",1324239025

We really just process payments so we can control the whole experience, but if you have your own gateway you can just plug the api keys in.

Yeah a few others have poped up this year (quixly & gumroad) they just really validate the need. If you don't need a fully fledged frontend store your options are pretty limited.<p>We're not targeting big head merchants (shopify style merchants). We're targeting micro merchants, the long tail of ecommerce; think the blogger who's still using ejunkie and paypal to sell online, or the kickstarter style sellers who just have one product and need a quick simple way to sell it. www.mmfixed.com - is a prime example for a merchant we are targeting.<p>That's pretty much the current MVP. We've been live with around 200 merchants for just over a month, and we've processed a few k, again in the first month. We have a couple thousand on a waiting list, but waiting lists never convert at 100% :(.<p>And yeah.

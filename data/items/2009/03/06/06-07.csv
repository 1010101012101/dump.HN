I'm a bit worried about the trend towards groupthink this encourages.  Perhaps the user did not read the article, krschultz, but users up voting your comment without hearing a response from the previous commenter is just as bad as your assumption.  The fact that your snarky response has gotten up voted seems suspect.  Regardless, discussion about the community itself is healthy, hopefully the HN community realizes that and can sustain it. To be clear, I'm not suggesting that the comment should not be down modded at all, just questioning the reason for which you claim you down modded.  (I'm curious to see if this comment will be down modded as well)",1236322758

It had a configurable (not sure if it was system wide, or user definable) number of versions it kept and it was simple to retrieve past versions (as long as it was within the number of generations it kept).  And since it was at the OS level, anywhere you could request a file, you could also specify the version.<p>I don't know if the versions applied to directories though (I doubt it, but my exposure to VMS was quite brief).",1236322146

505249,comment,504654,504654,0,0,mdd,,,"The article doesn't fully explain ""front running"", so here's Wikipedia's take: (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_running"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_running</a>)<p><i>Front running is the illegal practice of a stock broker executing orders on a security for its own account while taking advantage of advance knowledge of pending orders from its customers. When orders previously submitted by its customers will predictably affect the price of the security, purchasing first for its own account gives the broker an unfair advantage, since it can expect to close out its position at a profit based on the new price level. Front running may involve either buying (where the broker buys for their account, driving up the price before filling customer buy orders) or selling (where the broker sells for its own account, driving down the price before filling customer sell orders).</i>",1236321150

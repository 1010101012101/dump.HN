3765745,comment,3765504,3765504,5,0,bitwize,,,"No. Process is important; it's necessary. There are at least two prongs to this problem: one is you can't manage what you don't measure, and process gives you a way of tracking functionality implemented, defects, defects resolved, etc. There's nothing inherent to programming that gives your manager or your team any sort of knowledge about how far along you are, or just as importantly, when you will be done. You can hack all you like and -- even if your code is visible to all -- there's no way of guessing how far along you are, or if that needs-to-be-fixed-yesterday bug is close to resolution.<p>The other prong to this problem is you can't remember what you don't record. Well, <i>you</i> may have an eidetic memory, but unless the <i>company</i> generates deliverables besides code that explain what the code does or is supposed to do, a change in team X years down the line may mean the company forgets why Joe wrote the widget wrangler in the way that he did, and accordingly the widget wrangling module becomes an unmaintainable black box. Generating these deliverables is a part of the software process, whether Agile or otherwise.<p>And there will <i>always</i> be a process. This arises simply as a consequence of the fact that management needs to know how well you're doing, and if you're performing in a cost-effective manner, to many decimal places of precision. And if the process isn't agile, it could be something far less pleasant.<p>Agile Processes (big A) may sound scammy to you, like their proponents are trying to sell back to you shit you already know. But you only know that shit because you're a software developer. Management can't do what you do, and they're the target audience of Agile Processes like Scrum and XP. It gives them a ready-made Industry Best Practice that they can decide with confidence to adopt company-wide, with little perceived risk because it's so proven and widespread. Compare and contrast with the success of the ""open source"" meme in convincing companies to adopt, and participate in, free software.",1332935734

Different things entirely.<p>Agile is best practices around iterative and incremental development. Period. Yes, there's a manifesto and there's Scrum and all sorts of other things, but at the end of the day Agile is a marketing term. A place to go find out what people are trying in order to get better.<p>Two secrets here. One, team success is about 90% dependent on who is on the team. Good teams do well. Bad teams do poorly. But if you're going to have more than one team, you need some way to measure and talk about what they are doing, so you have to have <i>something</i>.<p>Agile -- when done correctly -- is just the minimum amount of <i>something</i> you need to get your work done. It is the minimum amount of process. After all, it's not like you can have no process at all. Whatever you're doing already is a process.<p>I've seen hundreds of teams struggle with Agile, and to me the problem is that we do a really bad job of balancing the difference between ""here's a best practice that worked awesome for about 80% of the teams that tried it"" and ""These are the rules. You must do this."" In many shops, Agile is just another way of micro-managing teams, sadly.<p>I can't help that. I also can't help the fact that lots of folks are out to make a buck on certifications and such. I don't think that makes Agile bad. Heck, I'm not even against certifications, although I'd never get one. I just think we take things too far.<p>I like the idea of having a marketing blurb ""Agile"" where I can go to find out what kinds of new stuff is being done. It helps me pick better reading material.<p>The second secret is that most teams, frankly, are not that good. So you need some kind of way to demonstrate that as well. Making things incrementally and in small iterations lets you see how bad teams are early on. You fail early and often. Then at least you have a bit of a shot at trying to help.<p>But believe me, I feel your pain. Sounds to me like you are a lot more upset at modern marketing and management attitudes than Agile. Remember that we technical folks have a way of over-doing whatever we get into, as I was writing in my blog before your post appeared!

Only then can you think like a child again.<p>This claims that creativity and education are diametral opposites. This essentially replicates the myth of the natural artist who can only achieve true creativity within nature and by forgetting culture. The basis for both assumptions is a fundamental divide between culture and nature, whereas culture is seen as hindering the creativity and freedom of the <i>homo naturalis</i>.<p>While I'm sure you can always find <i>some</i> cases where this distinction might hold true, there are plenty of others that reveal the false dichotomy at work here.<p>There is a difference between a solution perceived as complicated or simple, but there is no objective measurement for a difference in <i>creativity</i>.

3765729,comment,3763781,3764859,2,0,EvilTerran,,,"At least with Buddhist teachings, I'd definitely agree.

Whether or not it's been an effective <i>remedy</i> to those problems is a matter of hotly contested argument. But one is, perhaps, inclined to be more charitable to Agile when fixing it into historical place.<p>In principle, I don't think it's fair to call Agile -- the core, original theory -- a ""sham."" Rather, the ""sham"" is all the rigidity, trappings, and liturgy that have grown up around Agile since it reached its saturation point.

A well designed product will still require incremental on-the-fly improvements to get it right just as code does. Sometimes a design will require a refactor just as code does. Needing a 'complete' design doc before building a product is a fallacy.<p>They teach project managers that if they just let the designers and developers get on with it they can usually self-organise and manage their time better than if done top-down by a non-technical outsider.<p>They teach producers and 'product owners' that constant interference can be detrimental to a production process. Developers should be allowed to develop.<p>Best of all if done right they allow everyone scope to make mistakes yet still fix them and good mistakes that they can try out and keep.<p>However, there are downsides: scrum has no role for designers in the day-to-day production. Either they are pushed to the role of product manager or they have to work independently a sprint ahead.

From the same article:<p>""Why does every hacking and cyberscam story  real or fictional  seem to have a Russia connection?<p>In part, it is prejudice and laziness. The stereotype of the Russian hacker has become such a common media trope that it gets recycled again and again. It also offers a handy update for those looking for new ways to perpetuate the Russian threat.""<p>2. Following article line on FSB - anyone knows who hacked PCs of Iran nuke facility? If we judge on who had a reason - US - we shall assume that US have the same or even better hacker team than Russia [very clever OS hack that resulted in hardware malfunction at the nuke plant, thus significantly reducing its output - was covered in 2011].<p>3. I suspect that most of 'industry analysis' is funded by government agencies, directly or indirectly. So if the conclusion of 'industry analysis' would be that US accounts for 35 or 65 percent of global cybercrime revenue, then the next question would be - what the hell are the various government agencies doing and how effective do they spend government/taxpayers' money?<p>4. From the same article:<p>""However, a more basic answer is that a disproportionate number of Russians have worldclass math and computers skills, yet not the kind of jobs to use them legitimately. Although many firms in the industry are based in Russia, or else hire Russians, there is a pool of skilled but under-employed programmers who embrace the hacker world for fun, out of disillusion, or for profit.""<p>Anyone can show me a skilled but under-employed programmer in Russia?<p>""Skilled but under-emplored programmer in Russia"" is like Bigfoot [also known as sasquatch] - everyone heard about him/her, but noone saw.

I assume you guys have people monitoring the subsystems for backportable bugfixes?<p>I have no doubt that you guys have great support, but since the MegaCLI utility that triggers the issue is a closed source third-party piece of software, I could imagine the process of getting Red Hat engineers to even reproduce the problem would probably take longer than just going in and fixing it themselves. I can imagine having hosts with dozens of VMs going down is a high-priority issue - OK, less so once they discovered they could work around it by disabling monitoring, and eventually by upgrading the monitoring utility, but at that point they were already close to a fix. (also: they didn't say they <i>didn't</i> report it to RH...)<p>On a more technical note, if the MegaRAID driver only does DMAs to/from 32-bit memory addresses, this could be an artificial performance limitation on systems with lots of RAM (like the 128GiB in the article) as it potentially means waiting for <4GiB physical memory buffers to become available, and copying the data. It's not clear from the article if the 32-bit-only restriction only applies to STP requests, or all I/O.

On some architectures, jumping through an IMP is actually faster than an apparently direct call (e.g. because of the way the dynamic linker works).<p>Object layout: Again, if you care, you can grab a pointer to the variable you're using.<p>GC: I doubt the GC is used all that much in practice because retain/release is faster and better understood.  Your claim that reference counting is ""the slowest high-overhead form of GC"" is wrong, because it is based on old automated implementations that inserted reference counting operations automatically <i>everywhere</i>.  <i>Manual</i> reference counting is not usually dealt with in the GC literature, and as it happens Apple's more recent automatic implementation, ARC, does substantially better than the historic auto-reference-counting implementations that most papers discuss (indeed, in some cases it is more efficient than manual reference counting).<p>Another thing worth noting is that Apple's Foundation (and Core Foundation underneath it) have very efficient implementations of the collection data types, and indeed adapt their behaviour depending on their content.  This does not happen to the same extent in STL or Java, and means that simple programs can sometimes outperform their equivalents in other languages merely because high performance implementations in competitor languages would require that the author tailor his/her use of collections according to e.g. the number of items presented, which is not necessary with ObjC (at least on OS X).  You can read a little about this kind of thing here:<p><pre><code>  http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/posts/array.html\n</code></pre>\nFinally, I'll note that in ObjC, you always have the option of writing performance-critical code paths in plain C, or even in assembly language.  You can even construct your own task-specific JIT, if you like (which is made considerably easier by the availability of the LLVM libraries, though they are not the only possibility).<p>To summarise: I don't buy your ""Hotspot JVM means Java is faster"" argument.  It's based around a set of assumptions that don't hold in practice.  Java is definitely a fast language these days, and for some applications the JIT does indeed result in a performance boost, but it is <i>always</i> possible to equal or exceed Java's performance in plain C (and hence in Objective-C), albeit with some degree of effort.",1332933893

3765640,comment,3764640,3765160,13,0,kochbeck,,,"\rant{I think it's funny that you say this, because I was just remarking to someone the other day that the primary way I've seen TeX and its little forest friends age is that it's become rather unwieldy IN SPITE OF the fact that the hardware it's running on now is far more than an order of magnitude faster.<p>In college, I was typesetting my work in PlainTeX (I never did like LaTeX, but obviously I had it available) on a 14.77MHz 68000-based Amiga 2000, and the TeX distro came on floppies. I had a whopping 40Mb hard drive, and all the heavy lifting lived there - Metafont, dvips, tex itself. But they fit comfortably on 800K low-density floppies and ran from them, if you needed to. The other floppies were all fonts, and since the prevailing format for fonts in the rest of the world was Type 3 Postscript (yucky bitmap) and comparable TrueType, my work looked rockin.<p>So to review, I had it running largely off floppies on a machine a couple of orders of magnitude slower (and a couple of orders of magnitude less memory and storage) than my iPhone. And I frequently taught freshman English majors who wouldn't own their own computer for another 3 years how to use it, down to font rendering and selecting an output format for the target printer which was rarely Postscript back then.<p>Riddle me this then: why are current TeX distros completely indecipherable to me now? I mean, kpathsea was always a bit of a beast, but I understood it pretty much at a glance. How is it that, although I've used the platform on and off for two decades now, in the last 5 years I've had to call the Psychic Friends Network every time I tried to call a package that I thought I had installed correctly? Oh, and why is a whole install now larger than the sum total of all the storage I had at my disposal - every floppy, hard drive, mainframe quota, and gettemp limit - when I last used the system on a daily basis?<p>As far as I can tell, the last update to the core product was in 2008, and everything that's been added to the main engine since 1992 has been incremental support for things like modern font formats. So it should have grown linearly, not exponentially. But there it is. Big as life and twice as ugly.<p>This is actually the second question in five days I've seen in two different fora about, ""How is TeX holding on?"" And to look at the sample output that was produced by Lout, obviously the answer is, ""Because no one ever came up with a replacement that produced better output."" You don't have to ask Don Knuth to figure that one out. It's not that Lout hasn't surpassed TeX yet. It's that it hasn't beaten troff yet. The 70s called, and they're looking for their DEC LP01, man.<p>But I don't think people are actually voicing the question in their heads. I think the question they're actually asking is, ""Who let this godawful piece of Frankencode run through the village terrorizing the children, and why won't someone please scrape it all into a pile and teach it how to sing Puttin' on the Ritz like it did 20 years ago?"" Or, ""If you got this thing back into shape, why wouldn't it be the rendering engine for ebooks, because if it's setup right, it can render a whole book from source live on an iPad which is 100x more powerful than its original compile target?"" I can think of 20 questions like this. All the questions ultimately boil down to a wonderment that one of the best pieces of software ever written for making readable output is cared for so shoddily. It's like some laboratory experiment gone amuck on how layering bad abstractions on things makes even awesome things awful. }<p>And now for my next trick, I'm going to go integrate XeTeX into my current product to generate custom typeset results for customers. No, seriously, I am. I see 20 more years of this platform in my future...",1332933588

If he's given 1 hour, then using 59 minutes is just as valid as using 5. And rightly so.<p>As for the numeric problem, same thing. You are not giving a measure of ""goodness"" and you are not providing rules. I'd go ahead and fill in 2581 = fuck_you , where fuck_you is a constant defined as 3.15. That's a point-wise defined polynomial there. Voila, solved in 3 seconds. Just as valid as making up something as arbitrary as counting loops in a given numeric representation.

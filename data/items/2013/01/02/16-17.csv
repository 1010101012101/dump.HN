Additionally, there's zero transparency at ViewDNS. I don't even know who they are. That tingles my spidey sense every time I use the service.<p>Some of the tools at ViewDNS are already implemented as basic command line tools (ping, dig, traceroute, curl, etc), but more advanced items like the DNS report aren't. These are the tools I use most frequently.<p>The question for HN is: is there already a package or library that has the same functionality? Specifically, a tool that contains the non-trivial features like DNS reports with sanity checks, DNS propagation, spam database lookups, etc.<p>Assuming there isn't, what's the interest level in a toolset like this. Do you think it's something that makes sense as a package for a scripting library (like Ruby or Python), or do you think that it should be implemented as a native application for Linux (written in C)?<p>From my perspective, I see something following the Git CLI model where you invoke the tool, issue a command, and pass options.<p><pre><code>    newtool dns-report domain.com\n</code></pre>\nSomething like Ruby's Rake might make even more sense, with it's built-in support for namespacing.<p><pre><code>    newtool dns:report domain.com\n</code></pre>\nI think it makes sense as a scripting language package, seeing that there are no performance requirements here.

Or maybe I practically lived in one for a couple of years.<p>Would this do for you?<p><a href=""http://pics.ww.com/v/jacques/trips/jansvisit/?g2_page=6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pics.ww.com/v/jacques/trips/jansvisit/?g2_page=6</a><p>Yes, there is a section for metric in the hardware store.<p>It's the bit at the back with about 1/2 the sizes missing and only the stuff that you don't need in stock. I've had a machine shop in Canada (which officially had metric) and it was quite hard to get metric stuff. So hard that in the end we standardized on Imperial. In the US it was way worse.<p>Socket sets have standard and metric. Metric mostly for working on Japanese or European cars. But the most tools 'at hand' will be imperial. Maybe your experience is different but I've had plenty of bolts on my Japanese car wrecked by a shop putting imperial tools on them and plowing ahead. Works especially good if you use airtools, instant roundness.<p>You care about road signs because they're a sign that you really are standardizing. If your road signs are still in Miles then you're not a 'metric' country.<p>And you care about a tape measure only in metric because that's all you use in a metric country.<p>Machine tools - of which I owned a small fortune worth of - have things called morse tapers for the various tool bits. Morse tapers are adapters that allow you to quickly switch bits, most of the tooling that fits them is in Imperial. Collets, the elements that hold tooling for a mill or a lathe are all in imperial sizes. Unless you order from a very large catalogue it is very difficult to get mills in metric, but that is much more frustrating is that it can even be hard to source drills in metric.<p>Machining is done to thousands of an inch in the US. The rest of the world uses 1/100th of a mm for both turning and milling, and a series of fittings for more precise work.<p>The good news is that the bigger bearing companies all do carry metric if you need it. And if they don't have it in stock it 's usually only a day away.<p>Unless you've actually tried to design a somewhat complex chunk of machinery you might be given the impression that 'metric is easy'. In practice stuff like shafts, gears, supports and so on are all easier to source in Imperial than in Metric both in the US and in Canada too.<p>You want to order in Imperial, just one moment while I get your order form the warehouse out back. You want to order in Metric. That's perfectly fine, we're a metric country after all. Would it suit you to pick your order up in early march, possibly the middle of april before it is complete?",1357143746

But the moment your instances are up more than about 8 hours a day, and you have more than a few of them, it will quickly start costing you more than the alternatives.</i><p>I think Adrian Cockcroft & Jedberg may disagree with this statement.<p>Netflix has made a point (and a business model) of pushing all their infrastructure costs for their streaming service to AWS for many reasons.<p>They clearly have a HUGE amount of traffic across their service, and they are very successful in keeping a lean team on staff that has a focused skillset while not needing all the IT ops folks on staff. The HW costs to support their service would be very large as well as the distribution of that HW across the [nation|globe] to support their userbase.<p>Also, I do not think you're properly accounting for all the design and support considerations.<p>In a large infrastructure implementation you're going to need quite a few ops specialties: (in smaller orgs, these roles can be collapsed, in very large orgs they are discreet. Your ops costs get high fast in large infrastructure deployments)<p>Architect<p>Network<p>Server<p>Support (deployment, ops, maintenance etc..)<p>With the need for 24/7/365 ops coverage - especially if you have multiple regions/internationally deployed infrastructure... you can see how this can get expensive.<p>So, I think there are a few sweet spots that can be looked at.<p>Finally, there is also the hybrid model, where you have your own base-line infrastructure which scales out to AWS to support larger load (CDN model)",1357143218

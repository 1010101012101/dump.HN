Linus thought through how he thinks source control should work, and then designed a robust and brilliant repository structure first, with the tools growing up around that solid conceptual base.<p>Comparing that against the general madness of the Ruby ecosystem seems unfair.  Why not compare the state of unix utilities as a whole, which also have their incompatibilities?  Granted, Unix and POSIX in particular are far and away beyond the kind of standardization that exists in the Ruby world, and of course that leads to stable (yet powerful) interfaces that strongly benefit the ecosystem as a whole, but look at the time and resources it took to get to that point.

You are right to point out Apple's failures. iTunes is a beachhead product that they are terrified of abandoning or altering lest it kill the golden goose ecosystem (they have no qualms about killing the golden goose of other people's ecosystems, cf the pro apps series, in the name of usability, though I think their success record there is spotty at best).

2944453,comment,2943950,2944038,2,0,nitrogen,,,"In response to this and your subsequent posts:<p>First, let's draw an analogy to the territorial expansion of the human race.  Engineering is like building cities, while basic research is like exploration and mapping.  Before Columbus set sail there was an inkling that he might be able to find something of value, but nobody knew whether it would be gold, spices, etc., and certainly nobody foresaw the creation of an eventual world superpower.  Plus, city builders need explorers to identify suitable sites for new cities, and to make sure that an expanding city isn't about to run itself off a cliff (or into some other unforeseen territorial hazard).<p>Second, imagine that engineering is like exploring a pitch black cave.  Basic research is a flashlight we can shine in various directions.  Engineers can make incremental steps forward, but without science lighting the way, we won't know whether we're about to run into a wall.<p>Third, grandiose projects like the LHC or ISS serve as an inspiration to scientists and engineers in all fields.  Even if the primary activity of a giant project yields no useful results (""Not finding the Higgs"" in the case of the LHC, and ""Being in space"" in the case of ISS), the supporting research and engineering teams will develop useful technologies to solve related problems (like the grid computing systems others have mentioned).<p>To sum up, basic research like that done at the LHC is necessary to expand the possible solution space for further scientific research and engineering.  The further we push the limits of human understanding, the more branching-off points we create for the minds of applied scientists and engineers.  The more different things we have to think about, the more likely we are to think useful thoughts that haven't been thought before.  We need the LHC et. al. to be at the forefront of knowledge to provide plenty of well-traversed, fertile ground for applied science and engineering.",1314768489

I think Groupon would work far better for ecommerce sites because there you aren't limited to local customers, and would be willing to pay more for instant nationwide exposure. And because the audience would be enormous, they could command much larger margins and stave off competition from local sites eating up their business. Of course Groupon scaled up way too fast and is now heavily reliant on volume that only selling to a huge number of businesses can bring.<p>Assuming Groupon is in financial peril, if I were CEO I would think about canceling the IPO, laying off most of the employees, and switching to ecommerce deals.

I've done a MS in CS at OSU, and I always pitied the poor schlubs doing their undergrad. It's just a bunch of hoops.<p>My recommendation would be that you pick up a beginner PHP book and learn to build basic websites. Beginner level 0. There was a link on HN about how browsers and html5 work, see that, or see diveintohtml5.org<p>Then, if you see holes in your knowledge, look up something like stackoverflow.com -- SO also has a list of free CS books, look that up.<p>To actually program, start with HTDP or similar, mentioned in the SO bookslist. That will get you approx 7.53 times further than sitting in some braindead Java class, struggling to get above a 3.0...<p>Use your hard-earned money to spend on MIS courses. They'll get you a job out of school while a undergrad level java class won't. Don't do any of the courses you mentioned above either: DS, CO + asm (you're kidding!), SE. PS some of MIS is similar, you sound smart and motivated, so read the CS coursework books for fun if you want, buy them used.<p>Kudos on the Stanford MIT stuff btw. I would recommend starting with something like the iPhone programming course on iTunes U -- fill in the gaps as you come across them (which is the big advantage of self-study.)<p>Finally, CS has only one theory that you need to know; you'll like the title too.

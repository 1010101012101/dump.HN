Robert Wadlow as at the very limits of human height. He already numerous medical problems caused by his height and needed leg braces just to walk.<p>There is no way a bronze age man with access to bronze age medical care was able to live long enough to grow nearly 3 feet taller than Wadlow.<p>Since weight doesn&#x27;t scale linearly with height, a 12&#x27; tall man would be <i>enormous</i>. Robert wadlow weighed nearly 500 pounds. A 12&#x27; tall man would weigh much much more than that.<p>I think there are only 2 real possibilities to explain the giant. Either he wasn&#x27;t really as tall as the discoverer thought, or something was different to allow him to get that tall.",1400351280

As a Chinese student I don&#x27;t quite understand why RMS&#x27;s dressing like this.<p>Below is my comment on this news:<p>Two years ago, when I left China for US college, I feel most people around me don&#x27;t care about FOSS, or respect originality & copyright.\n- They use cracked software. You can buy a disk that installs cracked Windows for less than 1 dollar. Cracked Photoshop & MS Office & whatever licensed software are all over the internet.\n- They download music & movie for free.\n- China&#x27;s internet is full of copycats because the original websites aren&#x27;t available due to censorship. (Like FB & Twitter). One of the largest IT Company, Tencent, is full of copied products.<p>But now I feel China is making some progress. Like:\n- Online streaming companies are paying for copyrighted material, and you can&#x27;t easily download movie/anime for free as you do in the past.\n- As Apple becomes more popular, many people start paying for music in iTunes. To my delight, websites like <a href=""http://mou.li/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mou.li/</a> even let people buy Sublime Text & Alfred & 1Password easily in China. I really can&#x27;t believe people would pay over $50 for a text editor two years ago, but now some of them do.\n- A recent example. A very large company in China named Guokr launched a website: <a href=""http://www.15yan.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.15yan.com/</a> . It&#x27;s a blatant copy of medium. And in their about page, they are literally saying something like &quot;Our product is currently a copycat of Medium, and we&#x27;ll adpat it to Chinese market to make it better&quot;. \nShortly after the website went public, someone asked a question in a Chinese Q&A website: &quot;Can we tolerate such blatant plagiarism?&quot; \nTake a look at it: <a href=""http://www.zhihu.com/question/23400374"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zhihu.com/question/23400374</a> . I know you can&#x27;t read Chinese but take a look at the pictures in the highest upvoted(2130)[1] and third highest(756)[2] answers. Two Chinese Web-Devs compared the CSS and HTML of these two sites, expressed their anger, and described the copycat as &quot;humiliating&quot; and &quot;disgusting&quot;. Nearly all the answerers requested this copycat going down immediately and said they&#x27;d never use it.<p>I&#x27;m really happy China is really making some progress on this matter.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://p3.zhimg.com/69/e3/69e3f847236c2257d925ff11cbb14cc4_m.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://p3.zhimg.com/69/e3/69e3f847236c2257d925ff11cbb14cc4_m...</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://p3.zhimg.com/2f/6b/2f6b6e698413e0db745efdcb8be73867_m.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://p3.zhimg.com/2f/6b/2f6b6e698413e0db745efdcb8be73867_m...</a>",1400351233

How many businesses like my own that don&#x27;t actually have a physical address are there going to be? At what point do business completely stop accepting physical forms of payment? &quot;Cutting the cord&quot; completely is likely to get much more difficult in the future.",1400350986

Hell, my brother-in-law spent two years in Kosovo (as a UN peacekeeper) a few years back. He said that even then there were large areas of land that were still off-limits to people because of uncleared mines.<p>Despite the danger, and the warning signs, some locals are desperate enough to seek arable land where ever they can.

It directly addresses those ways to make people comfortable that are typically not plainly laid out. Everything is in easy to digest chunks, the book can be read nonlinearly, and it&#x27;s held up over time.<p>A few years ago I cracked it open again after having it read it very carefully many years before that. I was shocked how many techniques I had internalized to the point that I thought they were my own ideas, but paging through the book reminded me how much I learned.

55888,comment,55720,55720,0,0,geebee,,,"software is an interesting business, in that you don't have to ask anyone's permission, and there's no real way to know if someone is a real programmer, a fake programmer, or a non-programmer aside from looking at the code and applications they have written/created.<p>Does it make sense to speak of ""non-programmers who write software?""  In some ways, it seems like the act of writing software is exactly what makes a person a programmer.<p>I'm not trying to play games here - I do understand what the writer here is getting at.  People who have no background in software, somehow muddling their way into an application, for better or for worse.<p>But after a while, that ballet dancer who wrote his own ticketing app, or that lawyer who wrote his own billing app,... they become programmers.  Maybe bad ones, but programmers nonetheless.<p>",1190060725

Right off the bat, too.<p>I also agree that ""large things start small"", but which of these companies do you think really have potential to create enormous value for millions of people?<p>ZocDoc?  Zivity?<p>I'm just playing devil's advocate here...I hope some of these companies really knock it out of the park, but the roster is a little ""underwhelming"" on paper.",1190060340

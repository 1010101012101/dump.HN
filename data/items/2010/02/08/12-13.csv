1109609,comment,1109514,1109514,0,0,maurycy,,,"One thing that always surprise me about most of the web startups is why we're so reluctant to the affiliate marketing.<p>The industry has a bad name, I agree. On the other hand, it's just selling something for a provision. It does not have to involve sneaky get-rich-quick schemes. Most of the world sells something for someone and does (financially) better than many startups.<p>It's relatively easy to start selling for someone and when it turns out to be profitable, creating your own product.<p>For instance, it's hard to get into booking industry, w/o some partnership initially. Once you're big, though, you can drop the middle party and speak with GDS or hotels directly.<p>EDIT: I know that many startups are about changing the world. I'd say, however, that many are just about making money. And affiliate is a good path.",1265633978

For me, a statement like ""this code is beautiful but unmaintainable"" sounds perfectly fine and meaningful.

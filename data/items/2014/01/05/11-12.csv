7015406,comment,7013874,7014301,1,0,SwellJoe,,,"As a possible alternative view: I&#x27;ve made a living for the past 7 or 8 years from Virtualmin, despite the fact that we give away 99% of the code under a GPL license. The underlying core Webmin is free under a BSD license, and has millions of users, including countless commercial users who have distribute custom versions of Webmin for their management UI, none paying a dime to use it.<p>We have literally 100 users who don&#x27;t pay us anything for every one who does pay us something. It&#x27;s possible we&#x27;d make more money if we didn&#x27;t make FOSS...but, it&#x27;s also possible we would simply have two orders of magnitude fewer users (or maybe even zero users, it&#x27;s a competitive market, and our competitors spend a lot more on marketing and sales than we have the resources for). I&#x27;d rather have a million users and a thousand paying for it than just a thousand users.<p>In short, I&#x27;m not telling you how to run your business. Just pointing out that there are other ways to think about, and deal with, &quot;free loaders&quot;. They can potentially be your fans, your testing staff, your marketing team, and your eventual paying customers.",1388921030

7015357,comment,7015059,7015059,1,0,beagle3,,,"I don&#x27;t think a simplified C as such exists. The dark corners are part of C&#x27;s identity, and you can&#x27;t even use the standard C library without being aware of them (buffer overflows, arrays vs. pointers, etc.); And if it did exist, it would be almost useless to the point that no example you would find anywhere would work on it.<p>Go back one step: Why would you want one? Pascal / FreePascal / Delphi Pascal might work for you (dark corners not an essential part of the language, pretty comparable to C, albeit more verbose). Or there&#x27;s D, which is very similar to C, has much fewer dark corners if any, but &quot;simplified&quot; is not how I would describe it.",1388920102

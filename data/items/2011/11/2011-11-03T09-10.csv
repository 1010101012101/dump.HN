3190987,comment,3190785,3190785,2,0,yason,,,"For buying MAFIAA products, a much greater barrier than already having a copy of that film or music album is <i>not having seen or heard</i> it before. Given the amount of utter crap that is being sold as dvds or cds, the realistic price of buying something to merely check if it's good is negligible, if not zero. So, I only ever buy anything if I already know what I'll be getting.<p>Hence piracy: by obtaining a copy informally it's easy to check out if something's worth something. Another reason for piracy is better convenience. And given the ""convenience"" of hunting a good torrent, the convenience of buying the same film legally in some sensible format is abysmal.<p>I'm waiting for the said *AA to give up on the distribution and starting to sell plain rights instead.<p>I maybe alone but I can't count the number of times I've found some good music or a good film and wondered: I've got the product already but where can I just pay for it without getting a damn cd or dvd. Often I buy it digitally afterwards (even if I never download it) but that also implicitly supports a random eletronic music/film store that had nothing to offer and nothing to do with me acquiring the piece in the first place.

Tracking that down in a debugger is horribly inefficient, especially if optimisations are involved (how may times did you try to print a local variable, or a parameter, only to be greeted with <this value has been optimized out>?), so another way to see the program flow is required.<p>printf() does wonders in this area, if you can put them at the right places. Over the years, I found and fixed far more issues with printf() than with a debugger.<p>Granted, sometimes a debugger is neccessary, at least until I understand the problem, and become able to reproduce it. Then printfs it is again. If I can't reproduce it, and only have a core file to work with, then, obviously, a debugger is one's only choice. If I need to extract information from a core dump, a debugger is the way to go again.<p>But when trying to examine running code, printfs are - in my experience - more straightforward to work with.",1320312287

(Usually I do not validate forms on the client-side, since the data must be validated on the server-side anyway. And with schema.js, you can add custom localized error messages.)
Furthermore, schema.js has several modes that allow tolerant adaptation of values, so that they can be casted. ""5"", for example, is casted to 5. But you can switch to strict validation mode as well.
You can do everything, that contracts allows, with schema.js, too.
The best is that, with JSON schema, 1) you define secure validations, since with the default properties you do not forget important constraints, and 2) you do not need to test your validators any more.
Conclusion: I agree that such features must make it to the core of a language. Probably you can find some useful ideas in JSON schema and schema.js. I found the JSON vocabulary to be very useful to validate JS data.",1320312004

Now, Ubuntu is usually spoken of with a kind of regretful contempt.  I didn't much care for it myself, but Ubuntu used to be the public face of Linux, the thing 95% of the Windows/OSX users hit if they get interested in Linux.  As far as I can tell, it's fallen out of the good graces of the power user community.  It appears as if Ubuntu has decided to forsake the early adopters and power users in favor of the newbies and average Joes.

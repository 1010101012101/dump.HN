The character once present been trampled in favor of dystopian public housing for immigrant laborers and a cleanliness. Frankly, last time I was there it gave me the creeps so much I was haunted by the smiley-faced actors in the propaganda-piece on permanent repeat in the airline departure lounge.<p>Thailand: Perhaps 30+ times from 1989 to two weeks ago. My wife (mainland Chinese Muslim) and I lived there for awhile, and our daughter was born there. We can read and write to some extent, speak the language, and have many friends - local and foreign - from all levels of society (journalism, finance, diplomacy, mafias, restaurant and bar operators, media, etc.) including those who have been &#x27;kicked out&#x27;.<p>Malaysia: Perhaps 5-10 times from 1989 to a month ago, including smaller islands, though never to Borneo. It has a worrying governmental tendency to trend toward the Singaporean model, however away from KL this is lessened. Many successful Malaysians are either economic migrants to Singapore or operate businesses owned in some way by Singapore-resident straits Chinese.<p>Indonesia: Twice since 2012, but for months at a time spanning the most populous parts of the archipelago. Have had in-depth one-on-one discussions about the history of western relations with its diplomats. Have been invited to attend conferences in its national university. Owing to corruption, it has its issues, but it has preserved a certain admirable diversity that increases as you move east. Sure, they have their problems (eg. deforestation). However, the two faced Singaporean government blames the Singapore-owned palm oil plantations - burned regularly - on Indonesia ... but in fact I&#x27;ve had Singapore-resident Straits Chinese admit to me they own them.<p>What about you, just-arrived 7 point karma naysayer?",1427098551

I used to be one of those really annoying anti-X (PHP, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.) zealots. I thought it was funny but that experience made it clear to me that random snark can really hurt. Plenty of people use plenty of &quot;joke&quot; technologies to make real software people use every day, and snarking out on them is unlikely to help.

9249897,comment,9247099,9249139,0,0,gregjor,,,"To paraphrase Churchill, what I called classic PHP style is the worst form of PHP programming, except for all the others that have been tried from time to time.<p>The creator of PHP, Rasmus Lerdorf, recently said that &quot;all PHP frameworks suck,&quot; and his gave reasons for that opinion: <a href=""http://www.phpclasses.org/blog/post/226-4-Reasons-Why-All-PHP-Frameworks-Suck.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phpclasses.org/blog/post/226-4-Reasons-Why-All-PH...</a>. Elsewhere Rasmus has described his preferred style of PHP programming, which is pretty much what I described in my article.<p>It wasn&#x27;t my intention to damn all PHP frameworks, or the MVC model, though in my own work I agree with Rasmus. I do maintenance programming and the more I run into MVC-style framework-based PHP apps, the more convinced I am that those apps are actually more fragile and harder to understand and maintain than some of the worst PHP spaghetti code I&#x27;ve worked on. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s because the frameworks themselves suck. I think that&#x27;s because the framework and MVC model force the programmer to scatter related bits of code and data in too many places, obscuring the relationships and the flow of control. Some people delight in this complexity (perhaps believing it is more ideologically OOP pure). From a maintenance point of view it&#x27;s a pain.",1427097984

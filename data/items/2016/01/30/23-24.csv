11004439,comment,11002963,11004129,0,0,addicted,,,"I&#x27;m curious what positive articles do people think the NYTimes could carry about India? Keep in mind that being a US based newspaper, human interest stories about positive contributions by individuals outside the US are very unlikely to make it into a US based paper. What usually works is a wide systematic positive story, often through the lens of a few individuals.<p>When India was growing rapidly, and basically created a massive new middle class in the 90s on opening its borders, the NYTimes had a lot of positive stuff to say (Friedman, of The World is Flat fame, was one of the biggest promoters of India). This was a massive positive systematic change, that was covered widely.<p>But since then what positive systematic changes does India present that would be useful for an audience halfway across the world to know? There are a ton of individuals doing amazing work in India (and note, even this article focuses on the strength and bravery of individuals who fought the system) Indian institutions are famously terrible, and are getting worse. Frankly, the only possible positive stories that you could do about India that come to mind are the rapid rise of solar energy (however, all of that is in the planning stage at the moment...we need to see how it materializes). That&#x27;s pretty much all I can think of.<p>Frankly, India doesn&#x27;t help itself by screwing up situations we could have used to build a better image. You bring up Australia and sports. China did the Olympics, and it was an amazing spectacle. It truly changed people&#x27;s perspectives of what China was capable. India had an opportunity to do something similar with the Commonwealth games (although that would understandably be ignored by the US media anyways)and that was a massive disaster which only served to emphasize how terrible and corrupt our institutions are.<p>Edit: I think the NYTimes could do a really great positive (and relevant to the US) article on the Indian Electoral Commission. They basically moderate the elections, and have done a really great job in ensuring largely free and fair elections in a chaotic country which is otherwise awash with corrupt institutions. It&#x27;s actually pretty amazing that India has maintained and strengthened democracy in the past ~70 years, and the EC has a huge role to play in that.",1454198365

11004422,comment,10994707,11003202,0,0,at5,,,"Ah yea but bankers are like real estate agents; their incentive is to maximize their return per unit of time invested. If GS didn&#x27;t think there&#x27;s going to be a large marginal return (on time) in asking for more from the buyer then they&#x27;ll say ok, you&#x27;re happy I&#x27;m happy. It&#x27;s about incentives. And yea I am aware they don&#x27;t sign off but the Bakers aren&#x27;t exactly experts; they would have said yes if the bankers said yes and the numbers seem high enough for them. It raises the question of whether there is any value in standalone M&A advice. Sophisticated sellers don&#x27;t need pitchbooks and are well able to pull together their own models. Unsophisticated sellers basically go along with the bankers; who have no skin in the game and just want to close the deal. And then these sellers potentially end up with bad outcomes.<p>And yea the Bakers definitely should have gone with a smaller bank given the deal size. But hey, BODs make that mistake all the time too. Also given the size of the Bakers stake (50+%), not much difference between board advisory and management advisory is there? Theirs is the deciding vote.<p>Agreed with you on the last point. Been on more than one deal team where we&#x27;ve had to talk clients out of shooting themselves in the foot. But that&#x27;s part of the game. No engagement letter covers that but a sensible client would expect that from their banker. Legally GS was always in the clear.",1454198183

But they&#x27;ve largely sat on them without a product (prior to the watch) as they often do, seemingly because the end product would not be at the level of polish they desire. I get less of a sense that it&#x27;s a passive biding of their time to strike and start polishing, and more of a, is it possible to build it the way they want and have it be affordable (to their target market).",1454198037

However, the general idea and direction is certainly worthwhile - a light and simple solution for the universal pain point that is CSS.<p>A few ideas for where to take it come to mind:<p>Ditch the JS and just write a library of generic CSS classes that solve common use cases. Crucially these have to provide at least _some_ abstraction above raw CSS styles (e.g. &quot;always-centered-vertically&quot; and not &quot;margin-left&quot;). There are lots of these libraries out there already, but maybe there is room for something a little less opinionated, or lower level, or higher level, or whatever than what you get with, say, Bootstrap.<p>Keep JavaScript in the mix but use it at build time, not in the browser. Maybe you scan the source to see which classes are actually used and dynamically generate a .css file to send to the client that only includes those classes and no others. Or maybe you could use JS to do some fancier layout solving - depending on the structure of the dom elements in the source - to generate correct CSS attributes to support the abstraction.<p>I&#x27;m not super familiar with the state of CSS tools, so maybe things like what I&#x27;m describing already exist by the dozens.

We can just suck it up and deal with the stuff we don’t like while we’re writing JS. But for newcomers, it’s trickier.<p>Beginners pick up cues from the language (and its community) about how development <i>should</i> be done. They’ll think semicolons <i>should</i> get automatically inserted in ambiguous places, that all numbers <i>should</i> be floating points, that there <i>should</i> be only two scopes for variables, etc. To me, that’s a bad way to get started.<p>I worry that people who pick up JS won’t end up with enough perspective to reflect critically on JS itself. I worry that we’re expecting the future of web programmers to put up with too many of the hasty/bad decisions that were made in the 1990s. I worry that they’ll jump into a half-baked development vehicle and think they need to start reinventing wheels in order to get anywhere.<p>In the end, I wouldn’t tell someone NOT to learn JS in 2016, but I would give them a heft warning that there’s a lot more to programming and “software engineering” than JS can offer right now.",1454197261

Lots of kids have a very hard time understanding how math is relevant to them beyond basic arithmetic and a little algebra.

Students learning about computation...and what&#x27;s computable...can relate to it much more readily and can start looking for applications of this knowledge much more readily than what they learn in mathematics.<p>But the two subjects are married at the hip (like literature and history) and one can readily lead into another if they&#x27;re both present.<p>Just as important, the tools that exist for exploring computation are really quite good these days and students can do some really cool stuff if the environment is well structured. Imagine sitting down in a class and the assignment is to use Python to build a simple sentiment analyzer. Classroom materials are a list of scored sentiment words and a few dozen excerpts from literature or news.<p>Or reinforce mathematics lectures on probability by building a bloom filter.<p>K-12 education on computation, if done well, could help tie together many of the other subjects that students are taught and provide immediate application.<p>(imagine if the assignment for a 10th grade art class was to produce a demoscene demo!)",1454196393

This is not the kind of thing that’s being funded by the NIH, given their translational shift, and it’s not the kind of thing that can be done by industry because of the time horizon. Nonetheless it’s foundational to building a quantitatively predictive biology. It’s the sort of thing that can enable entirely new applied sciences and industries. And I think it’s possible.<p>There’s a certain way to doing this which I believe is key to success. It can’t be about doing molecular dynamics from atoms on up, because of computational considerations, and because that’s useless anyway (one wouldn’t learn anything beyond the known physics and maybe better force fields and sampling techniques). It also can’t be like the kludgy attempts that have been made so far (e.g. Markus Covert’s paper in Cell from a few years back—it’s perfectly alright work, but won’t get us closer to solving this particular problem.) Instead, I think the key is to develop a new layer of abstraction for describing biological phenomena, much like say organic chemistry is a genuinely new abstraction built on top of physical chemistry (which is itself built on top of QM), that hides away the irrelevant details (e.g. most of QM) while capturing what’s salient about the biological phenomena of interest. It would require advances in the aforementioned areas of models, theory, and tools, that are made in concert with the aim of simulating a cell.",1454195171

Which, if you believe in religion, it absolutely is.<p>To be clear, this is pretty untrue of Christianity, the dominant religion in Western civilization, so I&#x27;m constantly puzzled about this claim. (HPMOR makes the same claim.) The central story of Christianity is that God takes human form, dies, and <i>cannot stay dead</i>. If it were just &quot;Jesus died for our sins&quot;, there would be no need for a resurrection story; his followers would have had way more credibility saying merely that he was killed, which is far more objectively verifiable.<p>From 1 Corinthians: &quot;The last enemy to be destroyed is death&quot; (which, incidentally, comes up in <i>canon</i> HP), and, quoting the prophets: &quot;When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: &#x27;Death has been swallowed up in victory.&#x27; &#x27;Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?&#x27;&quot; From Revelation, also quoting Isaiah: &quot;He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.&quot; From a 1500-year-old hymn: &quot;Christ is risen from the dead, trampling down death by death.&quot;<p>Death is an enemy; death is not good, and should not exist.

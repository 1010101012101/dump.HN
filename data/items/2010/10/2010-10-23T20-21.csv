1824358,comment,1822847,1822847,0,0,kgc,,,"I was working at Microsoft Research making a mobile application for the iPhone. For the first month, I didn't even have access to the building. I would always follow someone else in. I also didn't have a Mac. I brought my own. (My manager covered for me.) About a month in, I had finished the first application, and it was ready for app store submission. Oddly, at about the same time, they tried to move someone else into the desk I was using... I didn't even exist in their HR system.<p>While waiting for legal approval for deploying the app, we drew up some screens and user tested/mocked up the next app on paper. A month passed... and we still weren't sure what legal was thinking or whether my mac would be arriving soon. Then we decided to just build everything on my personal pipeline. In a week, the first of two remaining products was finished, and then we finally received legal's response: we couldn't release an app on the app store.<p>I converted the apps to be a native-like HTML5 web apps. Then we found that in certain regions (China!), services we relied on were blocked. I set up proxies to redirect the failing requests. Additionally, GPS data is obfuscated in certain regions (China again...).<p>Then we ran into legal trouble again. Ruby on Rails was not an approved development platform. Fortunately, after a lengthy email argument that my manager, (whom I had taught basic Ruby/Rails skills in order to speed up development), was able to win, legal was convinced that there were no Microsoft products that had the functionality we required.<p>A couple weeks later, we launched the app to a bunch of people under NDA. The part that took the longest was getting them to sign the NDAs. Also, native-like nested list scrolling was a pain.",1287867529

It seems to me Microsoft has been really trigger shy about pushing forward on integrating all their various services and non-PC products closely with Windows due to their past problems with DOJ/EU. I feel like if they made a big push to integrate things like Zune Pass, Xbox Live integration, Windows Phone, cloud services, Bing search/maps, etc they would have a much more compelling platform.

1824332,comment,1822847,1822847,0,0,siculars,,,"Saturday, October 26th 1996. World Series Game 6 Yankees vs Braves in New York. I'm from NYC but had just started Fall semester away at Michigan State University. I had never had the experience of going to a World Series game and was not going to miss an opportunity to see one at home. I have no money, no ticket and no connection but hey, you never know.<p>So with the Yankees up 3 games to 2, I decide to hop an Amtrak leaving for NYC the day before and arrive in Grand Central an hour or two before first pitch. I get on the 4 train and half hour later get off at the Stadium. The place is absolutely packed. People as far as you can see. Everybody is chanting and the crowd is electric. I figured I would walk around the Stadium and see what I can see. Maybe there is a chink in the armor. Maybe there is a scam going on I can get in on. As I said, I grew up in New York City. I also used to work the streets of Manhattan selling stuff only tourists would buy. I guess you could say I have a knack for sniffing out scams.<p>Sure enough I see a tight crowd of people who obviously didn't come together off a ways from one of the Stadium gates. Something told me I should pay closer attention. Every now and then I would see the guy in the center slyly point over towards the nearby gate and see someone in the crowd mosey over to that gate and get in. Lets take a closer look. Turns out the guy outside the gate is in cahoots with his buddy, the ticket taker at the gate! They worked out a password system. You pay the money man and he tells you the password. You tell the password to the gate keeper and he lets you in. $25 and a fake ticket handoff later, I've made it into my first World Series game at Yankee Stadium!<p>Well, with no assigned seat the entire Stadium was my playground. I wandered from section to section and would keep empty seats warm. When their owner showed up I would just move on to the next section. To cap a perfect scam story, the Yankees closed the series that night, Wade Boggs rode around the outfield on some mounted officers horse and I walked away with the memory of a lifetime. Oh, the password was ""Appleseed"" if you were curious.",1287866626

X months ago you helped me with my business idea and now I have left my BigCo job, moved to the city of my choosing and am happily working from home!!!""<p>Historical facts:<p>1) People tend to speak highly of my writing ability -- even published authors and publishing company founders -- and I have had what began as an email of mine on a list wind up being quoted (after much editing) in a book.<p>2) I tend to be very polarizing:  People either love me or hate me.  Not much in between.  The only thing I have found so far that reduces the amount I get attacked is to go out of my way to avoid public praise.  This isn't a real good tactic for advertising something but has worked well for helping to encourage a budding grass roots movement for folks who are really deathly ill and whom all the experts have written off.<p>3) People find me provocative, which is generally a bad thing if you are trying to be helpful.

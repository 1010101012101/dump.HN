I'm definitely looking for a better remote backup service for my Architecture firm, for which I currently pay far too much, but my server unfortunately is Windows SBS 2003 - whose OS I truly dislike.  I am forced to do this for compatibility with my Revit BIM software unfortunately, so I guess your product won't help me.",1184817347

Once you hand over so much stock that the amount you and the people you implicitly trust hold dips below 51%, you've lost control. Clearly an issue outside of the 1/(1-n) equation, and yet not really relevant. Everyone knows this already.<p>Then there's the general notion of not handing out too much stock to too many factions, but this too is more or less established knowledge amongst the target audience.<p>Having said that, the nuance of factoring in odds of success is a worthwhile consideration. Hat off for explaining it!\n",1184816693

I'm looking for a team member or two to work to pursue it out. I'm an MIT grad student. If you're in the Boston area, contact me at vonsydov@gmail.com with a resume or an introduction. Thanks.",1184814141

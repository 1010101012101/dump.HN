It's not a good idea to recklessly jettison union protections without understanding what they're really doing in the first place.<p>You say organizing is easy with the internet, but sites like overhear.us only just launched, and we really have no data about how effective they will be.  Secret organization is not effective either, because in order to actually negotiate anything serious they would have to come out, at which point they'd be vulnerable.<p>And my example is about arriving at the best possible economic solution for everyone, not simply assuming that the way company ownership works is perfect and therefore any consequences of that are Good Things.  My example is about making sure the workers can excercise their economic power.  I am most definitely not saying that a Union should be able to prevent a Board from selling the company, nor even entering into a bad deal.  I'm saying that a company should not be allowed to use threats of force to influence the labor market (eg keep it disorganized by blacklisting leaders).

21325,comment,21269,21281,0,0,youngnh,,,"I think you're way off the mark.  Advertising a keyword instead of a url is a much more effective way of directing users to a specific page on a website.  AOL knew this, and when they were the dominant service provider tons of companies would direct you to their site through an AOL keyword.  Today I still hear a lot of radio commercials encouraging listeners to get involved in contests by going to their websites and entering a keyword.",1178890605

21318,comment,21107,21249,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I've worked on one that's distributed and partially web-based (large parallel-programming cluster with 3 different web clients and two desktop clients).<p>The difference is that in a webapp, you have to think of the implications of distribution <i>on every user request</i>.  So you have to consider latency and status feedback for everything the user does, you can't use shared state, you have to keep in-memory data structures to a minimum, you can't count on getting notification when events occur, and so on.  Desktop-based apps with a distributed back-end usually have a well-defined interface to the cluster.  As long as you don't need to update the backend, you can keep anything you want in memory.  And you usually have a two-way connection: you don't need to frame everything in terms of request/responses.",1178888984
21317,comment,20470,20543,0,0,Goladus,,,"I agree.  For games people pay to solve made-up problems that are only just challenging enough to be fun.<p>Games like Zelda and MMOs start simple in order to ease you into the game.  Yes, part of the fun is the carrot-on-a-stick, but the importance of the whole dynamic is that you're only given as much as you can handle at one time.  Gradually, as you get accustomed to how the game works, complexity is increased.<p>For productivity software, it might be useful to create a tutorial in the form of a game.  ",1178888814

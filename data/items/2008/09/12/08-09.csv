C#, VB.Net, Java, and even C++ are nowhere near the source on OOP (and they are all in the same lineage...while JavaScript shares far more with Scheme and SmallTalk, and is thus on a quite different road).<p>One should be careful about thinking ""different"" means ""wrong"".",1221209864

That's a major shift my company is about to take, we're focusing on non-profit organizations and government institutions that need to refocus and establish goals around evolving technology requirements and enhancements.<p>In the next few months we're going to be on a campaign to find as many pro-bono developers, designers, consultants and experts to fill the void between non-profit and relevancy.",1221209742

302252,comment,302202,302221,0,0,netcan,,,"Thanks for the link.<p>Wufoo & BlinkSale are interesting cases. I was surprised to see their conversion rates so transparently out there. But services like Freshbooks, RegOnline, RescueTime & 37 signals stuff are not really what I'd call part of the 'Freemium' business model. The free version is either limited in time or functionality to the point where you can't be a 'real' user (like you can with Gmail or Dropbox) without being a paid user.<p>Even BlinkSale is kind of borderline case. Serious users would 90% of the time need a paid account. Wufoo is also near the 'sample' end of the spectrum though it looks highly usable with a free account.<p>Nothing wrong with that of course, non one says you can't sell services.<p>Also they're all in the business tools arena. That's definitely an area where paid tools are likely to succeed. But it's an area that (as you can see from those examples) it's pretty straightforward to sell software subscriptions. But they really don't get us anywhere near a facebook premium.<p>Flickr is potentially a good example. It's consumer oriented & I'd guess the great majority of users are always going to be free users. But is it earning it's salt this way yet? Or is it still in the wait & see category with Google Apps Premium?<p>BTW I downloaded dropbox today & I can see myself paying for the service, but also see myself using the free version.",1221209367

302249,comment,301913,302227,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Sweet!  And since you get to pick your implementation for server-side work, you don't have to remain in the IE ghetto.  But, obviously, I haven't been following JavaScript all that closely.<p>I guess they had to use a different keyword instead of var (much like Perl introduced <i>my</i> because <i>local</i> already meant something strange in Perl 4, and for sort of the same purpose...though <i>my</i> became the new right way to declare variables anywhere, since the goal is always to get smaller scope for variables, and it doesn't look like that's the right idea with <i>let</i>).<p>JavaScript still doesn't have namespaces or a package/module concept, though (right?), so it seems like there'd still be some pain points in building large modular software.  Of course, it's a pretty flexible language, and I've seen some interesting usage of closures to replicate namespaces and packages, so I guess standardizing on a library that provides those facilities is all that's really needed.",1221209230

All I can really give is, it probably has a lot to do with the popularity and recognizability of said founder(s) not to mention their stories, their time with the company, and numerous other factors that all together make it a lot easier for the company to outlive its founders.",1221207699

302238,comment,302202,302212,0,0,netcan,,,"Actually, I had read that article but forgot about it. It's probably where I got my description of the model. It's a good article. Gives you a feel for the context of all this. I totally agree that free services have gotten a major upgrade as part of the economy & that it makes sense. \nBut on the incentives to service providers, they just list a few: advertising, cross subsidy & <i>freemium</i>.<p>Advertising is an old one. We know that one from the TV/Radio/Magazine world. We also know it's not capable of funding every type of popular free web thing. (Great on Search, less great on Facebook).<p>Cross subsidies - Also pretty straightforward. Real estate site provides tools, Google gets people to like them etc. etc.<p>Freemium, on the other is not as well trodden. Especially if your strict about excluding free samples from the category.",1221207551

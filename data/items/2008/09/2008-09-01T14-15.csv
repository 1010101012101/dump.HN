If there was any suggestion that they were being written to get freebies, wouldn't they lose whatever credibility they currently have?",1220279738

291902,comment,291855,291887,0,0,rsheridan6,,,">What a shame that Amazon hasn't figured out how to provide this as a useful service. Amazon knows who buys a lot, they know <b>who reviews a lot</b>... why not ask those people if they want a free prize now and then? An <b>influential person</b> would earn the right to a huge number of free samples.<p>The idea is that people who might influence other people to buy something would get it for free.",1220278311
291901,comment,291599,291599,0,0,pivo,,,"Some of these objections seem dated. For example, accessor method overhead is optimized away now, and has been for a while.<p>I'm not a big fan of Java, but I do use it for work. For the kind of applications we write (large, long-running, thousands of users with lots of state) Java's memory management is one of it's strong points. That's why I'm excited about new languages based on the JVM such as Scala and Clojure.",1220277712

I guess what bothers me about this piece is the sense I get that the author is writing from the perspective of optimizing ones personal profit.  He is basically saying the only reason to learn multiple languages is for competitiveness in the job market and even then you should learn as few as you can get away with as well as possible.<p>That sounds like the argument of a technology major to me rather than a comp. sci or engineer.  He totally ignores the fact that many languages are based around the same core principles and if you know those well learning a language is like learning a new word from the dictionary it just happens naturally when it needs to be done.",1207313954

He instead recommends reading high-quality code, learning computer science theory, and mastering a few quality tools (not Java).<p>I thought this was going to be a ""let's make fun of this idiot"" Reddit-type post, but I was wrong.",1207313866
154735,comment,154692,154692,0,0,mosburger,,,"I think the article would be received more warmly if it were put into the perspective of a company project.  I.e., don't implement this new product in XYZ just because I want to know/learn XYZ and it's all the rage right now.  <i>That</i> would be a waste of time.<p>I'm a full-time Java programmer now because it pays the bills.  But you'd better believe I'm learning other lanaguages on the side, because it's pretty clear that Java 1.) has some serious limitations that other languages don't have, and 2.) is falling out-of-favor as a web development tool to more flexible, less statically-typed, more functional languages.<p>It's not so much to ""open my mind"" as it is to keep myself marketable after Java's impending demise.",1207313793

Buffett's comments on the large numbers of manufactured homes foreclosures is pretty interesting in that the same thing will likely happen to the housing market.

154729,comment,154692,154692,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"I think he misses the important benefit of being more marketable as a programmer.  I have a major problem when I interview people and they are totally focussed on one language (e.g. Java).  It's not the language that ends up worrying me, it's the lack of curiosity.<p>For that reason I often ask people in interviews to tell me about the computer they have at home: what OS does it run and why?   And I ask them what they hack in their spare time.   That tends to be very revealing.",1207313049

People learning one language and sticking with it for life is why COBOL stuck around for so long, and Java seems to be going the same way.<p>EDIT:  I just read the article.  Maybe it's just that many of the languages I've been learning have had little syntax and no operator precedence quirks (or any operator precedence whatsoever).  I also noticed the article made the same comment about COBOL and Java that I did.  I really should read these things first.  Anyway, I guess as a high school freshman I'm still at the point where learning new languages is really the best I can do.",1207311766

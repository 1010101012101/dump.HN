5993069,comment,5992141,5992544,6,0,zzzeek,,,"I was having this issue earlier this year after about ten years of not enough exercise (with some years excepted).  A couple of years ago, a routine physical showed a small blip on my EKG, &quot;nothing to worry about, but here, go see this cardiologist&quot;.  A (very stressful) stress test and a holter monitor test later, the doc didn&#x27;t seem to think my EKG issue (a right bundle branch block) was much to worry about, but &quot;you really need to get your fast heartrate down, if it&#x27;s not a medical issue then you need serious psychological help&quot;, so thanks doc!  It&#x27;s known as &quot;white coat syndrome&quot;, medical settings scare the crap out of me.<p>Anyway, for the next couple of years I found exercise in some ways to be stress-relieving as it always did, but the shadow of &quot;what if your heart is bad&quot; was really messing it up.  I developed palpitations which persisted for about a year, scaring the crap out of me regularly.<p>The two things that have at least for now ameliorated it are: 1. I went on antidepressants (lexapro), this is not the first time I&#x27;ve been on them and despite HNsers who think they&#x27;re bunk, it&#x27;s pretty obvious they have a positive effect, and 2. I got a personal trainer at the gym.  Both have downsides: one is side effects, the other is PTs are incredibly expensive.  But the advantage of the PT is, she pushes me <i>so</i> <i>hard</i> that you get to experience levels of cardio workout that are way beyond what I normally would do on my own.   So between just experiencing ridiculous, prolonged cardio workouts as well as the heart strengthening effect they have, my resting heartrate is down to 60 at night and I don&#x27;t generally have palpitations.  I wouldn&#x27;t say the problem is solved, but working out very intensely with someone there who will most likely call 911 if you keel over has been helpful.",1372985793

There are many circumstances where it makes sense, but I&#x27;d consider that a part of your password policy. In general, encryption is secure by itself, and I&#x27;d avoid adding unneeded steps.<p>As for password hashing, that is a very different application than deriving a key for encryption. You are storing the result (usually in a database), and in the case there is a leak, hoping that no one can brute-force the passwords. This is when you start the process of changing salts and work values (in the case of scrypt), and getting everyone to change their password. Using a KDF in this case makes a lot of sense.",1372985181

5993025,comment,5991576,5991576,1,0,wilkie,,,"Commenters: you need some terms defined with context. Let&#x27;s do that. I&#x27;m a founder and one of the current maintainers of the distributed/federated microblogging platform rstat.us.<p>In this particular context, centralized vs distributed have to do with control over both storage and propagation of your data more so than its architecture. Or at least, the concerns over how to better control storage/propagation drive decisions about architecture. Twitter, Facebook, etc are centralized in this case. Your data goes to them, they propagate it, you have little to no control. Their system is designed around that. Identi.ca, rstat.us, diaspora are distributed. You control the software that holds the data and distributes it to others. Many designs are possible, even that which you design yourself.<p>Do these distributed platforms still have centralized components? Yes. There are lots of centralized pieces. Doesn&#x27;t matter. Minimizing them is still the goal. Less is progress. It&#x27;s not perfect; it&#x27;s better.<p>What&#x27;s stopping distributed platforms from overtaking centralized ones? The typical things: politics, lack of resources, high barrier of entry for non-tech folks.<p>Can distributed platforms do X? Yes. For example, the very usual: &quot;But they can&#x27;t handle spam!&quot; Sure they can. Distributed platforms exist to share information. They can share blacklists. Share training data for spam filters. Ultimately, if they can distribute content, then they can distribute metadata. The only thing a centralized platform can do that a distributed one cannot is provide immediate global consistency... but considering most centralized services grow to the scale where they are internally distributed anyway, they can&#x27;t even do that.<p>What do we need to do to succeed? We need software that is light, easily understood, easily augmentable, modular. Something that can easily and freely be deployed with minimal effort from a city&#x27;s public library. Deployment on hosted or publicly available servers... or packaged on cheap hardware to be used in the home or taken with you. Hardware and deployment services that don&#x27;t really exist. But creating the software may be the motivation to create them.<p>Who will build it? I&#x27;ve published research on distributed systems and distributed databases. I founded rstat.us with some friends which has had over 60 diverse contributors from around the world. It got some good, albeit small press, but OStatus (the protocol that rstat.us sits upon) is being superseded. So I&#x27;m working on this:<p>- <a href=""https://github.com/hotsh/lotus-i18n"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/hotsh/lotus-i18n</a> - Support for social sentence generation for many languages/cultures<p>- <a href=""https://github.com/hotsh/lotus"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/hotsh/lotus</a> - A discovery layer and data structures for distributed social graphs. It negotiates the protocol so many different distributed social systems can interact (which is the point, ya think?). (models)<p>- <a href=""https://github.com/hotsh/lotus-mongodb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/hotsh/lotus-mongodb</a> - Small persistence layer. (models+db)<p>- <a href=""https://github.com/hotsh/rack-lotus"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/hotsh/rack-lotus</a> - Rack extension for interacting with the social graph and content generation as hypermedia over HTTP. (controllers)<p>- <a href=""https://github.com/hotsh/lotus-site"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/hotsh/lotus-site</a> - Example site (hoping to pull much of the view/presentation logic into a separate repo)<p>Modular. Easily modifiable. Released as closely to the public domain as is possible (CC0.) With these combined, you can build any number or variety of distributed social web systems (image sites, photo album sites, hosting of web comics, flash games, blogging, etc etc etc.) Hopefully they will share a common deployment strategy so if you build a new thing, however unique, it will be just as easy to deploy from the point-of-view of somebody not very well-versed in technology.<p>So...

Instead of putting a joint under compression they put it under tensive strain.<p>Closed chain exercises are the opposite, the hand or foot is rooted in place (pushups, running, squats, etc) and because of this they add stability through the compression, BUT because of the compression they can also exacerbate injuries (especially because closed chain exercises are often weighted or involve repeated impact).<p>In the end, like most things, there is no one size fits all.  In some situations closed chain is better, other open chain is better.  For the average person it doesn&#x27;t matter as much as most people think.

You might be surprised to learn that he regards todays one-size-fits-all GUI as a tragic outcome. That paradigm, he said in a talk at Accelerating Change 2004, has crippled our effort to augment human capability. High-performance tasks require high-performance user interfaces specially designed for those tasks. Instead of making every task lie on the Procrustean bed of the standard GUI, we should be inventing new, task-appropriate interfaces. No, they wont work for everyone. Yes, theyll require effort to learn. But in every domain there are some experts who will invest that effort in order to achieve greater mastery. We need to do more to empower those people.<p>The above cites Engelbart&#x27;s 2004 talk &quot;Large-Scale Collective IQ&quot;, so that is probably a good place to look as well.<p>There&#x27;s also this page, which presents some interesting related comments by Alan Kay: <a href=""http://traction.tractionsoftware.com/traction/permalink/Blog9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://traction.tractionsoftware.com/traction/permalink/Blog...</a><p>> Alan Kay: ...

One thing that &#x27;sysadmins&#x27; encounter than &#x27;programmers&#x27; don&#x27;t is a wide variety of systems with a varied install base. The more portable your coding, the easier time you have as you progress.<p>Throw in that programmers work on more monolithic projects, getting the libraries for those is (kind of) a one-time affair, but with sysadmins working on smaller, multitudinous projects, you can end up with a raft of different libraries to manage.<p>The real answer, as always, is &#x27;be appropriate&#x27;. Often libraries are called for, but sometimes they&#x27;re to be avoided. It depends on the use case, or even the library itself (we&#x27;re currently using an abandoned one in production... and there&#x27;s some crossing-fingers going on as we don&#x27;t have the resources to fix it if there&#x27;s breakage...)",1372982402

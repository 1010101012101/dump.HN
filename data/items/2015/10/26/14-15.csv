At present ~2 of them have to receive communications internally or externally over HTTP, so we have those fronted by a proxy to make service discovery easier.  (It is, regrettably, not an off-the-shelf proxy, since one of them required application-specific routing to a sticky host(s) depending on the contents of the HTTP request).<p>The thing which has made our lives MUCH easier from an orchestration, discovery, and routing perspective is NSQ, an OSS message bus.  It&#x27;s an event model rather than a request model -- producers of events say &quot;Hey world, by the way, EventType just happened.&quot;  and consumers can register to say &quot;Apropos of nothing, please tell me about any EventType&quot; without producers or consumers having to be aware of each other or aware of what a consumer intends to actually <i>do</i> with regards to the event.<p>Events go into topics (&quot;a type of event&quot;) and each topic can have an arbitrary number of channels (&quot;one thing which should happen for each event in this topic&quot;).  If you&#x27;re clever about where you raise events, you can stitch together arbitrarily complex systems by just adding new consumers on new channels, without having to make the producers aware of the new functionality at all.<p>Concrete example: We wanted a log of all orders made to the stock exchange.  We have a little utility, nsq-to-s3, which takes all the events on a topic/channel, persists them in memory/disk for a while, and periodically flushes that log to S3 for long-term storage.  This trivialized the logging feature.  (I was going to write our own nsq-to-s3 but an OSS project of that same name existed and was adequate to our needs, so we didn&#x27;t have to go to 8 microservices... yet.)<p>This was much easier than making a generic S3 logging service and then making edits to seven microservice codebases to make a HTTP request out to the logging service, with e.g. retry/failure recovery/monitoring/etc, everywhere in those codebases we wanted something logged to S3.",1445871267

It is just mentally taxing trying to wade through a sentence structure that seems aimed at a goal of obfuscating knowledge and proving the writer is intelligent rather than disclosing the information in a terse digestible way.\nBelow, someone pointed out that there are many grammatical errors as well. I have thought a lot more about long form articles in publications like the New Yorker and NYT, etc. While often criticized for over simplifications and lack of understanding of subject matter, they often present articles in a way casually interested parties will understand.\nI don&#x27;t have a problem with the jargon, large/obscure word use (to the extent it is reasonable) or otherwise employing tactics to get the point across. It is just that, as someone casually interested (not an academic looking for citations) I don&#x27;t really know what to do with this sentence:\n> Cannabis use almost always predates psychosis, is associated with an earlier age at onset (Donoghue et al., 2014; Myles et al., 2012b) and heavier and more potent cannabis users have an increased risk of developing psychosis (Di Forti et al., 2009) and do so at an earlier age than people smoking milder cannabis (Di Forti et al., 2014).\nI wish they would just use superscripts for citations, as a significant portion of that sentence is citations. If academics would just edit the papers, dump them into Tufte CSS or LaTEX with sitations as footnotes or sidenotes and adapt a style human beings could digest without collapsing to rest from the boredom and dull overly-complex structure I think they may find a readership base that exceeds the single digits it currently has.\nDo you know of a place with interesting articles written for non-academics? I think that would be a cool thing and sure it exists? Cheers.",1445870984

If you juice them instead of blending the whole thing, you lose a lot of the nutrition. You are no longer eating it in the original state it was intended to be consumed. They were designed to be a complete package, the nutrients complement each other and enable your body to deal with and use the other things in the food. If they were grown with pesticides or herbicides, these can contribute to cancer. If the ground they are grown in is nutritionally depleted, the food will be also. If the ground or water used is polluted, the food will be also. The best thing is to buy a water distiller, to clean your own water. Then grow your own fruits and vegetables using that water and using high quality, clean, plant superfood. From <a href=""http://www.foodrising.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foodrising.org/</a>, you can even purchase a very low maintenance, small hydroponic system that allows you to easily grow very nutritious, better than organic fruits and vegetables.",1445870605

Everybody seems to be trying to isolate their CSS into modules so they dont conflict instead of using the CSS together in harmony.<p>After writing thousands upon thousands upon thousands of lines of CSS here are my quick opinions:<p>- 1 global CSS files should take care of 95% of the styling, and if a specific views needs to override that global style, give it a teenty tiny bit of CSS<p>- SASS is cool, but largely unnecessary, and so I believe that 80% of the time people use it it just creates more work (learning curve, project requirements, compliation step) than it saves.

When I see nested CSS I go on high alert for bugs because it is clear the author doesnt understand CSS<p>- while IDs and classes can be useful, So many frameworks now work in a way that they write all of the styles you might nedd in advance and then you &#x27;tag&#x27; which elements get which styles ising classes. This is literally no better than inline styles, and is an abuse of HTML in an attempt to not have to write a small amount of CSS. If your markup is CLEAN and simplethen styling it with CSS is also very straightforward. I havent read the authors piece but in the past year I have noticed a drastic reduction in my own use of classes and other identifiers in HTML as my understanding of more advanced CSS selectors has increased.<p>CSS is a beautiful, POWERFUL language, and I would recommend everybody to do a few things:<p>- stop using CSS you didnt author<p>- write your CSS by hand (no SASS, STYLUS, LESS)<p>- Only ever copy-paste code youve written, if youre bringing external CSS into your codebase, retype what you need from it.<p>I know those sound like youre going to be sitting there forever typing in thousands of lines of CSS, but operating that way VERY QUICKLY forces you to gain skill at discerning what is actually required or not.<p>Whenever I do responsive consulting I feel like most sites are 5x overbuilt in the HTML, which means that your CSS is many many times longer than it needs to be.

The problem is more business-driven than technical; so let me explain why (and feel free to correct me if you think I&#x27;m wrong!)<p>Most companies don&#x27;t need microservices, so I&#x27;m making an assumption that any company using microservices has both the volume and complexity of business partners that make a microservices approach a good business idea (this assumption is assuredly false, but still useful). And if you&#x27;ve gone this route, the next step is generally organizing your business around an SOA where business units can be represented by an API (microservices are useful from a business perspective because you have many stakeholders within a company that want to make small changes frequently but independently). Once you&#x27;ve done that, you start wanting to encapsulate your relationship with your customers in an API as well, and the eventual destination (if your company survives long enough and is successful) is that you just operate a set of APIs that power your customer-facing UX product in addition to the API-based services you provide to your high-volume clients.<p>My point is this: the end state of a microservices architecture is an API gateway. API gateways provide essential services such as authentication, access control, and connection throttling. You still need something like HAProxy to provide you with load balancing, health checks, etc. across many nodes - but you&#x27;re going to have a very simple instance of HAproxy for each microservice and rely on your API gateway to organize everything under a single domain.<p>With microservices, your configurations can get incredibly complex very quickly, so it&#x27;s often better to maintain independent components with very simple configurations (that can be easily updated dynamically) than to try to have a single component in the middle of your stack upon which many other components are dependent.",1445870215

I guess what could be surmised is that nuclear power is only completely safe in the absence of human nature. Which makes you correct in a round-about way.<p>However, it is unsafe in comparison to what? Nine times out of ten not being able to breath anywhere on the planet, forever, seems like the more dangerous prospect; versus making a specific piece of land uninhabitable for a few thousand years. Nuclear waste is far easier to see, which makes us more aware of it and hence our monkey brains believe it is more dangerous (&quot;smoke just dissolves into the air!&quot;).<p>I can&#x27;t think of any power solution that doesn&#x27;t have severe drawbacks; however, nuclear is at the very least not the top contender in that list.",1445869150

Thus, the value still exists within the economy, it is just the distribution is different as said employees are producing value in other sectors of the economy.<p>When a founder forms a company he is not creating value. He is redeploying existing labor to do OTHER things. Whether that creates new value is a separate issue as said labor could create new value wherever it was before. Additionally, the founder is also creating a new corporate pyramid structure that funnels a lot of the redeployed wealth from this labor towards the people sitting on top: Whether that be himself or shareholders.<p>Let&#x27;s say there are two companies. Company A and Company B. Company A is a established company and Company B is a startup. Lets also say there is one worker, named Chris. When Chris works for company A his work output is 20$ a day.<p>Let&#x27;s say Chris changes his job and moves to company B. You&#x27;re telling me that Company B by virtue of being a startup makes chris&#x27;s work output suddenly equivalent to 100$? Tell me what magic makes this the case? What is it that makes it so new value is created out of thin air? It&#x27;s not physically possible. In fact it&#x27;s stupid to think that just by creating a startup you&#x27;re creating value. You&#x27;re just redeploying labor.<p>So where does new value come from if not just from a company by virtue of being a startup? The answer: When new technology or new innovations are created that fundamentally change the infrastructure of the economy so that it can be more efficient. It can happen from ANY company and it can even happen from government, it does not have to come from a startup. Examples: Apple: iphone, military: internet.<p>To tell you the truth, most startups amount to shit. If anything the majority of startups redeploy labor onto endeavors that amount to nothing. Usually big corporations more effectively redeploy labor. Could any random startup do what apple did to the phone industry? Probably, but waay less likely.",1445869057

You shouldn&#x27;t tell a doctor how to doctor, or a laborer how to labor, according to a zillion dramatic morality tales.  Its deeply hardwired into the culture itself.  Therefore its culturally wrong to mess with a railway workers switchgear unless you&#x27;re a railway worker, which you probably are not.  You can daydream all you want about possibly knowing how to operate railroad gear, but according to doctrine if you were a railworker, you&#x27;re supposed to be pretty pissed off if some random member of the general public disrespects your entire field of employment by flipping switches.  No matter your real or theoretical employment, we&#x27;re indoctrinated to leave those switches alone.<p>The next deeply indoctrinated belief is people are conservative about what they know best.  Obviously you know nothing about railway operations, or at least less than the guy assigned to operate that switch.  Clearly someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing set the switch that way for a reason, so if I operate that switch I&#x27;m almost certain to be doing something wrong because the guy assigned to it felt he was doing right.  In part two of the classic telling, clearly the fat guy knows he&#x27;s not fat enough to stop the train by lying on the tracks so he didn&#x27;t jump on them by himself therefore pushing him on the tracks is just going to increase the death toll.  The only people who want to upend the cart are actual experts, arrogant, or insane, at least according to cultural myth.<p>Its possibly in a different culture we&#x27;d get totally different results.

So if there are 10 issues a day caused by bad policy, and you can change it to only be 5 incidents a day, no one is going to push for changing it because then they would be viewed as responsible for the 5 incidents instead of being viewed as reducing the incident count by 5.<p>You pull the switch to kill one to save 5, you have now directly acted to kill a person.  You are a killer, and while perhaps not legally a murderer, some will still view you as such.

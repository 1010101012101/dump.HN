591821,comment,590829,591024,0,0,mattmcknight,,,"That is a misleading analysis. The credit you are referring to as part of the money supply is bank credit, which is created by the central bank when they introduce currency units.  Credit has been moving from the private sector to the public sector.  The US govt has already run 1T debt in Q1.  What they couldn't borrow from abroad with treasuries, they had the fed print money to buy the excess treasuries. Now we're hearing noises about how the fed wants to issue bonds.  Inflation is coming, just have to figure out what to hoard.",1241405855

591793,comment,591309,591606,0,0,gambling8nt,,,"Because PG has finite time, there are two fundamental possibilities at work here:<p>(1) PG can find more ""great groups"" that he would want to fund than he has the time to work with.  This, I expect, is almost certainly the case; PG then has to determine which amongst these groups of founders with whom to work.  The question becomes, what function of the group of founders selected should be maximized.  If you ""give an additional point or two for being female founded"" then the function you are optimizing is not just a matter of competence and dedication--either you aren't actually altering your behavior towards female founded groups, or there is some sufficiently pathological example of groups being very similar in which there is a female founded group that is slightly less competent/dedicated than a male only group competing over one remaining slot, and the slot is given to the female group.  If no such example ever occurs in practice, then there is no point in giving female founded groups ""an additional point or two"" since it never altered the decision.<p>(2) PG has more time available than ""great groups"" with whom to work.  In this case, taking on additional groups simply because they are female-founded, in addition to being discriminatory, seems likely to be a net negative, assuming the original meaning to the term ""great groups"" was set to be at whatever level is necessary to have positive expected outcome.<p>Looking at this dichotomy another way, we can think of PG's time as a market resource.  In the first case, it is scarce, and should sell to the highest bidders (those with highest expected value, measured as utility for PG).  In the second case, it is abundant, and every consumer gets what they need/want.  In reality, it is probably either directly scarce (falling into the first category), or made scarce by the presence of other high utility alternatives (e.g., spending time with his family).<p>In summary, there is no ""in addition to"" as far as criteria with respect to which you want to maximize.  There can only be ""instead of"", or a (possibly zero) conversion factor.<p>As a side note, in another comment on this page (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=591537"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=591537</a>) PG noted that they don't ask the gender of founders when considering funding.",1241404182

Well, yes. However they are also a key part of the environment of the developing mind. Our environments influence what choices we make (by controlling the options and their relative costs, not by making the choices).<p>For example, if I am born near the sea then I am more likely to learn to swim before my cousin, who lives far from the sea. He lives in the mountains, and thus he is more likely to learn to climb first.<p>In the same way, boys and girls may have different susceptibilities to various memes, because their brain environments have differentially influenced their choices.<p>Under this model, average male and female behaviour will eventually <i>converge</i>. How? Because, assuming one progresses and lives long enough, parochial theories are replaced by universal ones. And one's biological sex and the memes I referred to are parochial factors.",1241402494

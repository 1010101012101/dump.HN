4746697,comment,4744595,4745487,2,0,tadfisher,,,"It's pretty simple once you know the rules:<p>- Always store times and calculate differences/offsets in UTC.<p>- Never attempt to convert a local time to UTC (it is <i>not</i> a one-to-one mapping!).<p>- Depending on your application, convert any dates to a given timezone <i>at the moment they are displayed</i>.<p>Now Javascript throws a monkey-wrench into the whole affair, because it assumes Dates should be handled in the user's local timezone, which, if you're dealing with timezone issues, is certainly not what you want. So attempting to convert a Date object from one timezone to the next is surely impossible to do without introducing bugs unless you understand the rules for every timezone you're dealing with.<p>Luckily, a guy named Olson created a database of timezone rules for us mortals to use in our timezone-aware applications. In another stroke of good fortune, some smart people wrote a Javascript library [1] that parses this database for you and can convert your Javascript Date object between any timezone on the planet. So you do all your calculations using this Date object in UTC mode, then convert to the desired timezone at the time they are displayed.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/mde/timezone-js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mde/timezone-js</a>",1352163542

4746658,comment,4745123,4745620,2,0,uvdiv,,,"Appreciate the effort, but there's some huge errors there. The reactor you mention will fission 1,500 kg of <i>one</i> isotope, U-235 -- out of some ~50,000 kg of nuclear fuel (3-5% U-235, rest being useless U-238), and 300,000 kg of mined uranium (mostly U-238, most of which is thrown away in enriching from 0.7% to 3-5% U-235 fuel). OTOH, your classroom uranium cost is for natural uranium, 0.7% U-235. So you're underestimating cost by 2 orders of magnitude at least.<p>Here's real numbers from the industry [1]. You use $90/kg. They say on the the order of $3,000 per kg of reactor-grade UO2, which is $60,000-$90,000 per kg of the U-235 isotope.<p>On the flip side, you're greatly overestimating fuel usage (your assumptions are equivalent to about 6 mpg mileage), and you have a unit error where you accidentally multiplied by one thousand (45 kW * 2,500 hours = 112 MWh, not GWh!). So the figure is about 1/3,000x yours: about 5 grams U-235, or 100 grams reactor-grade fuel, or 1 kg of natural uranium. Costing on the order of $300.<p>This doesn't apply to (imaginary) nuclear cars. With reactor-grade fuel, you need hundreds of tons of uranium, and hundreds of tons of moderator, to get a critical reaction. This won't fit into a car. The only way to approach a reactor this small is to use highly enriched fuel -- ""weapons-grade"", which is not sold at petrol stations. This is how they miniaturize reactors to fit in submarines and space satellites (like [2], not an RTG).<p>If you <i>did</i> try to build a car like this, it be pathologically wasteful. The amount of HEU would need to be several kg or more, to have a critical reaction at all. But because a car uses so little power, you would burn less than 1% of it (several grams) over hundreds of thousands of miles. Extrapolating (using [3]) enrichment costs ($150/SWU from [1]), the fuel cost would be on the order of $300,000. And almost entirely wasted.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf02.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf02.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.etec.energy.gov/Operations/Major_Operations/SNAP_Overview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.etec.energy.gov/Operations/Major_Operations/SNAP_...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.wise-uranium.org/nfcue.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wise-uranium.org/nfcue.html</a>",1352162919

They don't care about politics, about science, about reason or about anything outside of their day to day lives and relationships. That's how it's supposed to be.<p>As it turns out, the average person isn't brilliant, anointed or blessed (this is due to the meaning of the word ""average""). Saying that everyone is ""brilliant in their own way"" is a cop out, a platitude that's no better than saying nothing at all. Intellectual curiousity, love of learning and scientific rigor are real things, and a large number of the humans on this planet don't possess them. If you object to the idea that Neil DeGrasse Tyson is more brilliant than most, then you're in danger of losing touch with reality.<p>If NDT is showing any arrogance, it's in thinking that he has the ability to raise the level of public discourse. He's really smart, but apparently not smart enough to realize that no amount of education can change the basics of human nature. You can teach people how to think, but you can't make them like it.<p>A laughably small number of americans vote in presidential, much less local elections. And many of those voters have only the shallowest understanding of the issues being decided upon. deGrasse Tyson has a point...education may be democracy's only hope.<p>ASIDE: I'm noticing rampant selection bias on hn. It's important to remember that most of the people on this planet are nothing like us. Working at tech companies and hanging out at tech events it's easy to believe that everyone is as intelligent, reasonable and hard working as our family and coworkers.

The fact that compatibility has a lot of advantages doesn't change the nature of that functional necessity.<p>>Copyright in general is not a matter of inherent evil but a balance of rights.<p>Of course, but that's the point. You weigh the evil against the good. If someone creates a thing and is a good steward of it then they have a first to market advantage over competitors in addition to the implementation copyright, so as long as they're being good stewards and only collecting their creation costs plus a fair profit, they'll have the market all to themselves because prospective competitors will see that they can't profitably do any better as against the need to spend the resources to create another implementation. Only when a copyright holder is allowing the market to decay or imposing unreasonable restrictions or pricing on users will there be a sufficient incentive for others to enter the market, and why in that case does it make any sense to give the copyright holder the power to prohibit such competition?<p>>I also agree that forks are not always a bad thing but they could be permitted by the copyright holders (if API's are copyright).<p>The problem is that in almost all cases the copyright holder wouldn't allow it -- a full reimplementation fork is only necessary when the existing maintainer is doing such a sour job of it that you think you can justify the enormous reduplication of effort necessary to compete with them, and in that case why would they sanction a competitor?",1352160868

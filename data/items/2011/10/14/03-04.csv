Birth rates would have to fall.  We would have to find ways to support more of us on fewer resources.  Major sacrifices and changes in lifestyle would be absolutely required.  Our species as it is now would likely not survive such a transition.<p>But, as Carl Sagan said: ""It will not be we who reach Alpha Centauri and the other nearby stars. It will be a species very like us, but with more of our strengths and fewer of our weaknesses.""",1318564615

In fact, according to Fitts's law, they should be jammed into the corners of the screen since that's even easier to hit than a screen edge. But they aren't because it's <i>not</i> that hard for anybody who's bothered to use a pointing device in the last 20 years. More important than that, trackpads are becoming the de facto pointing device on Apple sold computers and Fitts's law works differently on a pad vs. a moving device like a mouse. The edge of the touch surface is the infinite target, not the screen. Since touch devices are not 1:1 mapped to screen area, all clickable interfaces should be at the edge of the pad relative to wherever the cursor starts.<p>Likewise, a second mouse button turns out to have been a great idea, so great that decades later Apple guarantees that they not only support right mouse buttons, but their default mouse not only ships with support for it, but they even have managed to cram a touchpad into it and their trackpad recognizes a two finger tap as a right-click.

Because decades into the great GUI experiment it finally dawned on somebody that interface complexity requires more than one button -- otherwise half of your interface gets buried behind a modifier button (or two or three) or a pile of menus and your sole button.<p>I've watched many dozens of users move to OS X and one of the <i>first</i> things they ask is ""why is the menu bar way the hell over there?"" -- with pointing to the top of the screen (or to an entirely different monitor depending) usually preceded by a series of questions about how to do some function that is clearly on the menu bar, but since it's not coupled to the actual program window, they assume it has a decoupled function from the program and don't realize what they are looking for is there.<p>It's an embarrassingly repeatable user interface experiment that's left me convinced that the only reason it's still part of the OS is to differentiate OS X from Windows.<p>Physically decoupling software interfaces from the software is almost always a bad GUI idea if you can help it.

Garbage collection, no unsafe pointer arithmetic, type specification different from variable use (varname: type)<p>Hmm, I'll give you the last one, although they left out the colon.  The others are common to basically all high-level languages, so I don't really think of them as due to Wirth's influence.  To my eye, the interesting aspects of Golang are interfaces, slices, and goroutines, none of which are present or even hinted at in Oberon.  Interfaces were kind of anticipated in OCaml, slices in D, and goroutines in a family of CSP-derived languages going back to 1980.<p>> > ALGOL-60 doesn't have bitwise operations<p>> It was just not standard only because CPU instruction sets were not standard enough. [ALGOL-68]<p>Well, on one hand, it wouldn't be very useful to try to do bitwise AND on a decimal machine.  But the original claim is that, prior to C, general-purpose (i.e. not purely numerical!) programs gained so much speed by being written nonportably that portable versions could not compete, and C enabled high-performance programs to be written portably.  Your original rebuttal, as I read it, was that 10 years prior to C (i.e. in 1963) ALGOL had already achieved this.<p>We can stipulate, I hope, that bitwise operations are crucial for the inner loops of a lot of important algorithms.<p>Now, it appears that you're saying that not only had ALGOL not achieved this in 1963, but that it was impossible for any language to achieve it in 1963 because CPUs were too disparate, but that ALGOL-68, whose first usable implementations were concurrent with the first usable implementations of C, <i>still</i> didn't standardize those operations, so you <i>still</i> couldn't write portable programs that used them!  (Although you could write programs for one or another ALGOL compiler that used them.)<p>I think you have proved the point of the original article rather than rebutting it.<p>> FORTRAN had [more than one precision of floating-point], C didn't care initially. And FORTRAN remained faster for long.<p>For numerical code, yes.  But I was talking about the inadequacies of ALGOL-60, not Fortran (which is <i>still</i> faster, as you alluded to earlier).  C's limited support for single-precision floating point was a sore point for decades, but not supporting it <i>at all</i>, as standard ALGOL-60 didn't, is much worse.  It doubles the size of all your arrays!  That's much worse than simply doubling or quadrupling your run-time, as C could; you can almost always run the program for twice as long, but you can only rarely double the core at its disposal.<p>> sorry, ""lite"" ""closer to the system"" language was even before Pascal and obviously before C, it was a bootstrap language for ALGOL W in sixties, see sources:<p>> <a href=""http://bitsavers.org/pdf/stanford/listing/Algol_W_Listing_Nov69.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitsavers.org/pdf/stanford/listing/Algol_W_Listing_No...</a><p>That code is written in PL360, and although, yes, it has bitwise operations in it, nearly every line of it contains assumptions that it's running on a 32-bit computer (such as the 360) and about which CPU instructions set which CPU flags, with gems like ""R0 := FLAGS(I) AND #80000000; IF = THEN ..."".  It's pretty strong evidence that, in 1966, even Niklaus Wirth thought he had to write nonportable code  essentially assembly language with ALGOL syntax  in order to get acceptable performance.<p>He explicitly rejected FORTRAN, and he claims he didn't have an ALGOL-60 compiler available.<p>> And then Pascal was also written in Pascal after it was bootstrapped once.<p>I've certainly seen Pascal compilers written in Pascal, but the ones I've seen were concurrent with the development of C or later.

3109773,story,,,18,18,x0ner,"Ask HN: I am 23. What's next?",,"There are times when I find myself at work blazing away at development or outside training for a race and stop to ask myself, is this is it. Not like is this what I am doing for the rest of my life, but the more general question of is this what people work towards all their life. Now I am being a bit vague here, but hear me out and let me explain. It helps to have some background on my story so hold on...<p>I grew up by the city in the suburbs where you had your typical gang per neighborhood and cops cruising around the area at all times. Drug deals were a regular thing during class time and it was likely that if you followed in your parents footsteps you would be pregnant at 17 and potentially graduating high school with a drug problem. Most of my friends fell victim to drugs in one form or another, so I learned to steer clear of most of that stuff. Plus my dad told me he would kill me if he ever found out (little did I know he had his own problem with it all).<p>My parents split apart, but before my dad rolled out he set a solid work ethic in me. That or I realized home wasn't the greatest place to be around and decided it would be best to make money while disconnecting from my ""family"". I started work at 14 changing oil and found the ability to make my own money was the most liberating experience ever. I made a point to ditch the required high school work forms and limits and cut a deal with my boss, 30+ hours and I would make it work. During the summer I put in well into 50 hours as much as I could and enjoyed life.<p>Fast-forward a couple years and I am in high school goofing around in a networking class. I was told before joining the class that graduating from this school would land me 16 college credits and 19 if I passed the certification. Call it what you will, but I found high school to be a joke, so I went to college at night starting in 11th grade and decided I would make the whole school thing go by as quickly as possible. During this time I continued to work full time, and volunteered at some tech startup doing Internet sales. I also did the usual teenager activities like going to parties, hacking companies in the city, doing graffiti and running from the cops.<p>Jump ahead 1 year after high school and I am working for a government contractor building circuit boards on million dollar contracts. I graduated high school early, bent the rules as much as possible and was the proud owner of an A.A.S degree in network technology. I later moved on to doing network engineering, but remained with the company for a year before making my next big leap. Meanwhile at home I was planning on moving out because the situation was only getting more annoying.<p>I realized that finishing my degree was critical to making any money, so I made that my top goal, but knew I would be bored doing nothing but school. You have to understand that at this point I had pushed myself far beyond my normal means and what once was difficult was now the ""norm"". Sleep wasn't required and all I wanted to do was work. I decided to go to a local college that took in all my transfer credits where a lot of the courses were online. I managed to re-write parts of my degree and pull 18 credit semesters while working the 50 hours as a security engineer while still having some sort of life.<p>I graduated early with my B.S in Information Assurance and managed to get a couple speaking engagements in the middle of that. I spoke at one of the biggest hacker conferences in Vegas, on career panels with college professors and offered my advice to those who asked or listened. Fast-forward some more and I have written articles for magazines, been offered crazy jobs with crazy money and have vacationed in some pretty cool spots. I have since fixed some of the issues with my family and feel as if I am becoming a more understanding person in regards to substance abuse and mental illness (things I have dealt with a lot).<p>Life and work are great and just in this year I have been to Canada, the Bahamas, Europe, California and Vegas. A lot of these were for speaking, some for vacation, but all of them great trips. When I got back I would tell my family how things went or what was on my mind. In some cases I wasn't too excited over everything and the comments my family made were more or less that they wish they had my life. It wasn't that I wasn't happy with all of this stuff, but it made me wonder if this is what people worked for. Was what I had someone else's dream?<p>I work at a university now doing forensic investigations and malware analysis. I could be making a hell of a lot more money else where, but I enjoy the people I work with and what I do everyday. I often stay late and base a lot of my life around doing things in the general area. Because I am staff, I get tuition benefits and while I thought I would never go back to school, I am thinking now it may be worthwhile since it's free. I am not sure if I want to focus on technology or if pursuing a degree in something else would be more of my thing. Either way, I think it would be nice to experience a little bit of the college scene I missed out on by rushing before.<p>Outside of work I race road bikes, workout a lot, am not too social, but keep enough friends around not to be terribly bored or alone. I go on several trips throughout the year and keep life interesting through funny experiences and the general mentality that life is about stories, not salaries. I know it is who I am to continue working like I do and to do everything I try to the fullest. I am excessive, easily bored and always seeking some challenge. I am far from being old or done, but there are times when I wonder if I will burn out. Will I work too much? Should I be doing more? Should I be doing things differently?<p>I guess the last thing I would point out is that I recognize I don't know everything and that I haven't tried everything. There is still a lot more I could be doing and a lot I could change both around me and within me. The ""being a better person"" aspect seems to take longer than changing what I'm surrounded by, so I hope this doesn't come off like a poor me, help me out sort of posting. It should be instead interpreted as someone who has done a decent job for being 23 and wants help knowing how to make life even more awesome. Hopefully a few people will read this and understand the sort of personality I have which I think helps in these questions.",1318562200

""<p>I've considered this problem, and am working on a solution for nirvana[1].  The biggest challenge to this project has been to take a language (coffeescript) that is sequential and run it in a distributed environment, without the programmer having to know distributed programming.  One of the techniques I'm applying is making a response (in this case, a web page) the result of a collection of components, which are rendered separately in the same context.  (EG: The context is the headers of the request, plus the user record if the user is logged in, etc.)<p>So, the request comes in, the components are loaded from the cache, they are executed (in parallel) all with a copy of the state, their results are aggregated and that result can run thru templating to produce a webpage that is returned.<p>The idea then becomes, instead of executing the code for every component in every request, if the component has no context specific requirements (e.g.: it is the same for every user, it's a static element, or it's dynamic, and but doesn't need to be generated every time) .. then it can be flagged as cacheable.  The caching would also have a staleness factor (Eg: 1m, 5m 10m).[2]<p>My hope is that you can have pages that are custom per user, but that also contain heavy impact results (say a graph produced by an expensive operation), where the results come form cache, the static components come from cache, but the user specific parts are dynamically generated each request.<p>This component approach not only lets the code be rendered in parallel, and often not even rendered, but instead pulled from cache, but it should allow for more convenient re-use of common elements and features across a site.<p>I hadn't considered caching for just 1s, though. Will have to think about that.<p>[1] Nirvana is CoffeeScript web development backed by erlang and Riak. Instantly distributed coffeescript.  It will be open source, hopefully soon.  Follow @nirvanacore on Twitter if you're interested in being notified.<p>[2] Planned. There are some implications of this that will require tradeoffs, so initially it may just be a flag of Yes/No for ""Cache for up to 1 minute."" or some value like that.",1318561981

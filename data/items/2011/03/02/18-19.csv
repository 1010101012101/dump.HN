It shows the time between each revision, and when it was working clearly showed that sometimes there were only a couple of months between revisions, and sometimes there was a couple of years between revisions (the 30 inch monitor springs to mind).<p>Most Apple products were completely unpredictable in this regard.  You could perhaps argue that the release of new computers or laptops was tied to intel's cpu release cycle, which while still appearing pseudo-random in terms of when Apple does their refresh, at least gives it some sane causal tie to the real world.<p>Oh, it seems to have loaded.  So okay, right off the top we can see the iPod classic has in the past had refreshes as little as four and five months apart, and then 4 years (2006-09) where the new models came out in September each year.<p>Note that with Apple sometimes what counts as a 'new model' is really minor, even just something as small as a price drop.<p>iPod Touch, same thing, releases in September. Nano, September.<p>Shuffle, updated <i>twice</i> a year during 2006-09 period, only updated once last year.<p>Mac mini, updated twice in 2009, and not at all in 2008.<p>Since 2003 there have only been 4 years with a single iMac update, all the rest had two or more (2003 had 3!).  So 13 updates in 8 years.<p>Mac Pro, only updated once a year since 2003 (2003 seem like a year where Apple pushed out a lot of refreshes).<p>MacBook, twice a year every year except 2005 and 2010, so 9 updates every 5 years.<p>MacBook Pro, multiple updates in a year not uncommon, 3 updates in 2006.<p>MacBook Air, once a year.<p>The first three iPhone updates were all 5 months apart (!!!)<p>The slowest updating ones of that lot mini, air and Mac Pro all feel (to me) like they update really slowly.  Maybe the Pro will pick up with the switch to consumer chips instead of the server Xeons.  In an industry with Moore's law (price per transistor halving every 18 months) running rampant back in the 2000s yearly or year and a half updates feel very slow.<p>The average Apple (hardware) product (including taking all the slowpokes into account) updates every 0.700205338809035 of a year.  Call it eight and a half months.<p>So if they release a new iPad in March, seeing another one in November (just in time for Xmas!  Funny that) would not be at all unreasonable.",1299092049

Done properly, correct code transformers can actually bring you a lot of power, such as handling exceptions correctly across asynchronous boundaries or enabling much more powerful control flows, such as being able to freely pass in callbacks that themselves may have asynchronous functionality, layered arbitrarily deeply. The only thing that can ""leak"" is exactly where the asynchronous breaks occur, but it's not that hard to see that.<p>It's quite debatable that ""the true nature"" of asynchronous code is in the manually-scheduled hacked up code that you write by hand in Node.js or similar tools. Other environments that don't require that make a good case for saying that the ""true nature"" of asynchronous code looks like the synchronous code, only with capable scheduling, and the real ""leaky abstraction"" is the way your terrible, terrible language runtime scheduler is poking out and requiring you to manually transform your relatively simple code into a spaghetti mess to satisfy it.

The common thread for most hacker coder types is that they just really really liked the ""power"" associated with writing code that could do anything, and so they started spending all of their time writing code doing all sorts of things.<p>All night debug sessions? Check. Several complete rewrites from scratch? Check. Using a language feature considered ""unsafe"" because it was the only way to get done what one needed? Check. Figuring out what ""unsafe"" meant? Check.<p>Once people are writing all of this code many want to know exactly how their code gets translated into what the computer does and they go off into their 'compiler' stage (some stay there for ever :-). This is where folks write their own compilers, by first writing their own lexical analyzers, then needing to parse those, and then needing to take those parse trees and generate new code with them.<p>There is a lot of exploration to do in 10,000 hrs. That's coding 6 hrs a day (and by that I mean coding, not checking Facebook or reading HN :-) for 5 years. There aren't a lot of short cuts. Sure there are CS programs which will show you what other people learned in their 10K hrs and help distill the concepts down for you but, like playing Piano, its not ""known"" until its in your finger bones.<p>Mentors are great for helping you get unstuck (since being stuck means you aren't coding which means you're not clocking your 10K hrs) and they can sometimes give you a heads up on road your travelling down, but mostly I think they are best for just sharing your enthusiasm and adding energy.",1299090185

Or he might be working at a low end teaching college (pay perhaps up to 50-60k), or still an adjunct (pay < $20k).<p>In some cases, scientists in this age range might go to work at the corporate ""Research Scientist"" jobs you described. In that case, they might be getting around $50k, perhaps up to $120k in hot fields.<p>35. Teacher, if I'm reading the NYC chart right, is between 70 and 85k. The scientist might have gotten tenure, in which case he is probably making close to $100k. He might not get promoted, in which case he is back to $80k (assuming he finds another tenure track job). He might be working on his third/fourth postdoc, where he is still in the $30-60k range. Or he might be an adjunct, pay < $20k.<p>The top scientists are certainly paid better than teachers. But most scientists are not. And adjusting for time worked (teachers don't work very hard, scientists do) and 3 months of vacation, scientists are definitely paid worse.",1299090167

2280522,comment,2280051,2280051,0,0,calvinfroedge,,,"Intensely interesting.  This is the most poignant section in the article:<p>""For example, imagine a man we’ll call Sam, who was born in 1900 and died in 1974. Sam entered a world of iceboxes, horse-drawn buggies and, commonly, outhouses. He died in a world of air-conditioning, Chevy Camaros and Moon landings. His life was defined by dramatic material changes, and Sam worked feverishly hard to build a company that sold brake systems. Sam wasn’t the most refined person, but he understood that if he wanted to create a secure life for his family he had to create wealth.""<p>I would add to this that between 1950, when Sam was an adult member of the working class, though nearing retirement, the world's population was 2 billion, and today, the world's population is 8 billion.  That in itself is going to manifest incredible levels of change.<p>I think the trend we're going to see over the NEXT century is going to be a return to production, away from SOLELY consumption of goods, simply because, as the article stated, there are fewer low hanging fruits.  Couple that with many more mouths to feed, and you have a recipe for a very different world in 100 years.<p>I believe just for the human race to survive, people will need to start growing food, en masse, at a local level.  Even people in cities.  Energy consumption continues to rise, but the means to produce it become more and more expensive.  We will need to produce alternative methods of energy gathering - which are renewable.  So what does the future hold, in my opinion?<p>1.  Rapid population decline after continued population growth because of lack of ability to support growth (ie Malthusian theory)\n2.  A ""return to the farm"" - a resurgence in small farms.  Energy costs WILL bring down big agrabusiness - just wait.\n3.  People using more LOCALIZED means to generate energy.  In the Philippines, for example (I was there in July 2009), there were a lot of geothermal plants being built near volcanos.  Hawaii has been investing a lot in harnessing wave power (and generating a lot of controversy from the surfer community).  I attended a ""Blue Planet"" presentation in Honoulu in May 2009 and talked to many of the leaders of this initiative.  Germany is the world's LEADER in solar energy now.  People will take what they can get, where they can get it, to meet their power needs.  Even in rural Kentucky, people are starting to put solar panels on their houses.\n4.  Thank god, less of an obsession with money and stuff.  Basic survival will once again trump all other needs until we can again reach a level of production where people can go through another lazy cycle.",1299089795

The economics of a material world are different than the economics of an information world.<p>Rob Gingell used to point out to me that people living during the revolutionary war didn't have a good feel for what the final rules were going to be either.<p>So I buy the insight that it takes fewer people to create Facebook today then it did to produce Chevy Malibu's in the 70's, however Facebook is creating opportunities for people like Zynga so you really have to ask yourself what is the set of all the people working on Facebook, or applications for Facebook, or applications that let you visit Facebook, or derive demographic data from the information pool of Facebook?<p>This is what will distinguish the information economy from the material economy. In the material economy the product (our example is the Chevy Malibu) is a dead end, it gets created, used, and discarded. In the information economy people build products which turn out to be pre-cursor materials to other products, or combined into still other products. Information products, even those that are nominally not 'tools', by their nature can be composited into new products, just like a DJ might create a techno trance mix of three or four of her favorite tunes.<p>Google, employs 24,000 people (approximately), and how many people have careers that exist only because Google (or I guess more properly search engines) exist?<p>So I read articles like this one and I feel like the author (in this case the meta author because the NYT is talking about Cowen's book) are struggling to understand something their brain wasn't prepared to understand, which is that information, like a Chevy, can have intrinsic value.

He rarely gives any in-place justification for his outrageous use of insulting and attacking language.<p>I realise some of this is explained by the fact that a lot of this stuff was written for consumption by people who were already aware of him and his ideas, other people at various institutions with him. However this begs the question, if your target audience is already so aware of your unusual ideas that you do not feel the need to provide any kind of context or justification, why moan so loudly at all? I'd love to see some of his colleagues reactions of the time to some of these tracts.<p>I guess when you're that far into the right-hand crevice of the intelligence bellcurve, you're going to fall into the outer quartiles for quite a lot of other psychometrics as well.",1299089077

""look to the master, follow the master, walk with the master, see through the master, become the master.""<p>I started coding HTML/CSS/Javascript when I was 15.  When I was 18 I was working on a $14M project doing HTML & jQuery.  19 and 20 rolled around and I thought I was hot shit and could get away without knowing much about object oriented programming and database design.  Boy, did experience beat me with a heavy stick.<p>After blowing through a lot of money paying other people, and not being able to evaluate what they were doing, I started learning to program myself a little over a year ago (December 2009).  It has been, by far, the best investment I've ever made.<p>You HAVE to have mentors, though, bookwork and experience alone don't cut it.  Some of my mentors, didn't do anything but talk to me - and ingrain in me the importance of fundamentals - and some basic vocabulary.   Some stuff that didn't make sense when I heard it, but produced those ""Aha"" moments later.  Other stuff, like the importance of pre-planning, prototyping, code readability, and NEVER using code you don't fully understand, I was told from the beginning were very important.<p>Plus, mentors can be different types of people in different types of situations.  One of my mentors was an experienced programmer who I lived with for a few months.  Others were dudes on stackexchange and serverfault (Yes, that counts), and others were those I read.<p>The bottom line is, you need to see yourself as an apprentice, always looking for a master to learn from.",1299088956

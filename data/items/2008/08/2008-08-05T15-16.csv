I've never actually had the chance to use Erlang, but I do have experience with concurrent applications in general.<p>I think concurrency will be the norm in the future, so I'm excited by things like Erlang, even if I've never had the chance to use them. I just want to make point out that a language like Erlang makes solving a hard problem easier, but it's not the solution itself.",1217951746

And one common form of the ""Shabbat elevator"" is, indeed, to set up the elevator so that it will automatically stop at every floor.<p>(This is all according to the traditions recognized as authoritative by Orthodox Jews.

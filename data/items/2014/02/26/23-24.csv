7309235,comment,7302645,7304088,1,0,gnerd,,,"> On the topic of men in prison, the US does indeed have a rape culture. I thought it was clear from context that I&#x27;m using the term the way western feminists do, but I guess I should have been explicit.<p>I am afraid it wasn&#x27;t clear. I do not have all the same cultural references and opinions you do. I saw the phrase &quot;the US does not have a rape culture&quot; and I thought, that sounded a little finger pointy. That&#x27;s all, I suppose that drives an urge in me to point the finger back. Glass houses and all that. I can agree with some of what you say, especially when you said you meant &quot;modern&quot;, not &quot;western&quot; as I think we have different definitions for the latter.<p>Perhaps my opinion is driven from a colonial history of my country and your country has less of that. Anyway, I have a feeling if we went further down this rabbit hole we would end up seeing eye to eye on many things, I&#x27;ll draw this one up to a simple cultural misunderstanding, not of you in India, but of you and I. So with that, I won&#x27;t take up any more of your time.",1393459186

I don&#x27;t know how much though you actually have put into this, but I&#x27;m curious. What do you consider a cheap computer?<p>I do all my coding (though it mainly web, which arguably might need less resources than other languages) in a medium tier pc. It&#x27;s a lenovo B590 with an i3, 8GB RAM. It&#x27;s not exceedingly fast but with two windows of chrome, 20 tabs each, 5 or 6 instances of PHPStorm open, and all the usual programs (email clients, dropbox, chats, etc) it still feels quite snappy.<p>The cost here in Austria was around 650€ or so in total, maybe less (I&#x27;m not quite sure now because I upgraded it little by little).<p>My question is if your plans are set around a dirt cheap machine that you &quot;wouldn&#x27;t care at all&quot; if it gets stolen, lost or broken... Or something more in the lower middle class where you&#x27;d have to be careful not to lose one per month, but you could still run most of the stuff you&#x27;d actually need for local development.<p>This question arises mainly for my concern is greater about not having a working reasonable internet connectivity hence making it difficult to work over ssh, rather than the laptop getting stolen or broken.",1393459127

When I turn on Fox News, for example, the ideas there are <i>absolutely</i> what I would identify as conservative. Supporting legislative and social measures that disadvantage gay and poor people, for example. Espousing religion over science. How could such an agenda be considered liberal, especially since they themselves use the word &quot;liberal&quot; as a swear word? This looks perfectly conservative to me, and I&#x27;m still really confused because you described these people as functionally liberal.<p>> <i>what&#x27;s the historically &quot;conservative&quot; answer about internet issues, for instance?</i><p>I&#x27;m trying not to refer to American conservatism, but to the concept in its original meaning when I say this:<p>The internet is new and potentially dangerous to traditional values, so one would expect the attitude towards it to be very negative. That&#x27;s the default conservative stance, right, to keep the social status quo or regress it where possible.<p>The internet is a relatively new phenomenon that threatens to change society, it&#x27;s a level playing field where ordinary people get access to untold quantities of information practically without oversight. If I had to speculate on a default conservative stance to it, without any prior knowledge, I&#x27;d wager they&#x27;d be trying to outlaw the free aspects of the internet, ridicule its potential, and generally try to convert it so it can serve traditional power structures. And, now looking at what&#x27;s happening in real life, that somewhat naive expectation turns out to be a pretty good description of what&#x27;s actually going on.<p>> <i>the laissez-faire amongst us generally end up on the conservative side when forced to choose sides on the grounds that conservatism in the US at least tolerates the ideas of laissez-faire, whereas liberalism at this point openly mocks it</i><p>Can you give an example where that&#x27;s happening? Looking in from the outside it seems that US conservatives are the driving force behind a lot of legislation with the explicit goal of limiting freedoms and social stability. Granted, both sides seem to agree on much of the more egregious stuff like mass surveillance and terrorism theater - but from where I stand at least I don&#x27;t see liberals trying to legislate against gay people. It also looks to me like it&#x27;s the American conservatives who are more in favor of expanding already sweeping police powers.<p>I mean, sure, in the end it doesn&#x27;t matter that much to foreigners like me.

Think up a rails project, and try implementing the whole thing via a TDD pattern.  Test, produce a really basic first shot, re-factor, repeat, etc.  And what better place to learn about or implement some algorithm basics than while profiling/refactoring code to make the whole thing as fast as possible?! I learnt almost nothing from algorithm books or lectures, what really made it all sink in was when I had problems that ran slowly, and I had to make them better.  Then suddenly the topic was relevant and I understood.  And of course, once you optimize everything, you tend to quickly run into the hard lessons of good design, because nothing makes things fall apart and get complex quickly more than optimizing everything, except maybe trying to optimize everything with bad design.<p>Will you screw up? Sure! You&#x27;ll be bitter and twisted, but the scars will be of experience. That&#x27;s what makes you learn.  The screw ups are what you remember, and when you hit a problem of your own making, suddenly you respect the solutions presented in the text-book a lot more, even if you don&#x27;t agree with them or feel they&#x27;re complex or constraining.<p>/editorial.",1393457451

If you get an $8/hour job as a greeter and you think that&#x27;s less than you&#x27;re worth, then you are welcome to not work there. If the supply of labor becomes scarce, then the wages will rise. The thing is that there are some jobs that just don&#x27;t warrant high pay. If I can teach you your job in an hour and it requires no skills or experience, then why should I pay a huge wage? It&#x27;s like buying a netbook and paying Mac Pro prices. It&#x27;s silly. While I know Wal Mart people generally work hard, the work itself is on a level of difficulty on par with collecting aluminum cans. If you find yourself working for 10 years as a Wal Mart cashier, then it&#x27;s your own fault. There are so many government programs for workforce education, technical training, university, etc. Instead of watching Dancing with the Stars or keeping up with the Kardashians, it might behoove some of these career low-wage earners to try to work a little smarter and learn a skill that they can monetize at a better rate than they currently earn.<p>For a short stretch in 2008, I was actually living out of my car, making barely $200 a week DJing at some shit clubs in Houston. I knew how to use a computer, but I certainly didn&#x27;t know how to code. Here it is in 2014 and I make more money in a day than I did in an entire month back then. I taught myself, reached out to complete strangers who where experienced to recruit them as mentors and in 2010 I started getting paid to code. I&#x27;m not saying everyone should learn to code, but there is a way out of shit-paying jobs -- but it involves taking initiative instead of blaming everyone and relying on the &quot;system&quot; to help.<p>I have little sympathy for folks who continue to make minimum wage for years -- it&#x27;s their own fault. That&#x27;s not a popular opinion, but it&#x27;s true. There is nothing stopping that Wal Mart greeter from spending his after work time learning something new.<p>Poverty is a choice. Maybe not a conscious one, but a choice nonetheless. I see plenty of satellite dishes when I drive past the public housing complex. I see plenty of $200+ sneakers using food stamp cards at the grocery store.

In one case it was caught at early stage and resulted in 9 years of life with last year being pretty hard. Earlier surgery and treatments were definitely worth it (i mean &quot;worth&quot; in general not in financial sense). In 2 other cases, late detection, despite pretty aggressive surgery and treatments - 2 years and 0.5 year with things going downhill pretty fast at the speed that one can&#x27;t just stop and rethink the whole thing. In the last case i was directly responsible for the aggressiveness of approach and given the chance i hope i&#x27;d not do it this way again (though at the start it was &quot;promised&quot; more like 3-5 years instead of actual 0.5 years - in addition to cancer there are also  very grave/deadly complications possible, including the ones from treatments and overall stress on the body by the illness, that one need to watch for very carefully). In the former case the first year wasn&#x27;t that bad so i&#x27;d say it was worth it, problem is that it is very hard to stop at the right time where more treatments would only decrease quality of life.",1393456777

What happens is that users of the network run the code themselves and their scriptSig is a proof that they ran the code correctly (and that the code accepted their inputs). The simplest way to do this is to replay the execution, but now it makes sense: The network runs the code to verify you ran it right, and by doing so the contract embedded in the script is made trustless.<p>Running the code in the network has a lot of downsides, however.  It completely lacks privacy (except to the extent that we have an opcode that implements a zero knoweldge proof of knoweldge of the discrete log of an EC point), and there is tremendous pressure on the computational complexity, implementation complexity risk, and size of these scripts because of the cost of verify them.  Script execution is a pure externality that we only safely know how to cope with by making sure that it is very very cheap (we do this in Bitcoin by making sure that trivial static analysis can determine the execution cost (measure the size), and then bounding that cost).<p>But actually executing the script isn&#x27;t the only way to verify computation was performed correctly. Using cryptography it&#x27;s possible to have constant size and complexity proofs, independent of the program size.<p>This lets you cook up stuff like: <a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=277389.0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=277389.0</a> and I find that a lot more exciting. Especially since these kinds of enhancements don&#x27;t demand the risky tradeoffs that making script more expensive demands.<p>I&#x27;m also excited about distributed oracles— programs that sign transactions conditional on user specified code, including— potentially— external inputs. The ability to have external inputs (trusted by the oracle) greatly increases the expressive power beyond what any in-consensus system could have, and using multisignatures with multiple oracles you can achieve good security though not trustlessness. E.g. &quot;This tx pays to bob if bob.com is on the first page of google, otherwise after april 1st it can be redeemed by greg&quot;.  I would expect to see any attempt at more powerful script first implemented via multisignature oracles before even considering making it trustless by merging it into the network.",1393456680

It&#x27;s a huge engineering effort. Gecko can currently collect cycles between C++ and JS, but extending that is not trivial, and I believe Safari cannot collect such cycles and instead by design avoids creating such cycles - but that would not be possible with the Dart VM.<p>It might not be practical for other browsers to adopt such a technology.

Then there would be just Chrome, a single implementation of a web browser, dominating the market like IE used to.<p>It might be good for users to have a single browser for a while, single implementations can move faster without regard for standards or openness.

There are two sides to a transaction: the transfer of money in one direction and <i>the transfer of goods or services in the other</i>. Making one side very secure (or free from government intervention etc.) while neglecting the other is like building a bridge with one pillar made of tungsten and the other of adobe bricks. It&#x27;d only be as usable as its weaker side.<p>The existing financial system is perhaps suboptimal in terms of transferring money, but it has pretty good tools of ensuring the expected goods and services flow back to the buyer: chargebacks, courts of law etc. The Bitcoin &quot;economy&quot; has nothing comparable except a vague spirit of community that fails more often than not (see e.g. the pathetic appeals of Silk Road 2 or Mt. Gox depositors). So when a fraudulent transaction occurs, the best hope of the victim lies, ironically, with the much maligned government institutions that they were trying to avoid in the first place. (Incidentally, this is also why it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable for countries to outlaw Bitcoin transactions and have a good expectation of enforcing it.)<p>There&#x27;s no way cryptography and peer-to-peer consensus protocols will provide verification for goods and services. It&#x27;s a hard problem, and Bitcoiners ignoring it will not make it go away anytime soon. Until it&#x27;s solved, have fun driving 18-wheelers across continually crumbling bridge pillars.",1393455732

I hope she makes it, and if she does, give her the time with her son that she probably deserves.

He too had multiple surgeries, chemo, radiation, etc.  While we here in Canada don&#x27;t pay directly for treatments, there was the cost of missed work, medical supplies, and the like.  The following is directly, and deeply, informed by my own very personal experiences with cancer:<p>Let her die.<p>Chemo isn&#x27;t going to save her, and it sure as hell won&#x27;t improve her quality of life.  It will give you maybe an extra year to watch her fade away before your eyes, and will inflict all manner of pain and discomfort on her in the process.<p>Your mother is going to die, far sooner than either of you would wish.  That&#x27;s unavoidable.  What you do have control over is the quality of her life in her last few months, and in the effect that her passing has on the people she cares about.  You can control how you spend what time you have left, but you have precious little control over how much of it you have to spend.<p>I&#x27;d suggest reading <i>How Doctors Die</i>[1], a take on how those who have the most experience with cancer and its treatments choose to deal with it.  Generally speaking, they don&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m sorry if this sounds harsh, but I watched my stepmother tear herself apart refusing to accept the inevitable and pushing for every last available treatment.  The extra six months or so that may have afforded him are not a six months I would wish on anyone.<p>You are going to lose your mother, and it will break both of your hearts.

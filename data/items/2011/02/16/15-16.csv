Experts in the area did not think they could do this, and even the people involved weren't sure. It's easy to dismiss this as ""yeah, it's just a big search engine"" once you already know it's been done. Besides not accurately characterizing the approach Watson takes, that sentiment misses the fact that this <i>was</i> an open question.<p>Paradoxically, people would probably be more impressed if Watson did worse and the game was more competitive. It's like watching an NBA team play a high school team. The NBA team is so good that it looks <i>easy</i> despite the fact that they're that good because of decades of practice.<p>(Disclaimer: I work at IBM Research, and have associated biases.)",1297871967

Further, there are organization who will pay that amount so for every 10 that offers $100-$200 there is one that will pay what they ask (I don't know the exact ratio, i am sure it is less than 10 to one it could be 1000 to 1). but the point is the ones that do buy make it possible for the speculators to sit on domains and not take the deal. Further there is a secondary market of list in which speculators can offload there domains to other speculators at around $100-$300 so there is no pressure to move a domain at this amount.<p>The reality now though is top level domains are pretty much irrelevant for anything other than brick and mortar advertising. Google gives credit for the words in the domain name no matter the top level. and all the social media is linked so users are not entering a URL anyways. personally if I was not going to be doing real world advertising I would have picked up a two letter country code name with the best keywords. Then if I ever grew it to the point that I was going to do a real world advertising campaign I would consider picking up a good .com and bite the bullet on the cost, and just forward the .com to the established domain.<p>Another way you can do it, is to ask the reseller to lease it to you with a contract on the amount to convert it to a purchase. So say you lease it for $75 a year and have a contract in place that at any time you can convert it to a purchase for say $2000. This gives you the ability to build revenue with the name before you commit to buying it, the speculator will usually bite because he is getting the domain fees paid until the potential sale goes through. So it is a win win, for him he is not incurring the yearly renewal fees and you don't put out a chunk of change until the name actually has value.",1297870073

A great majority of people who are designers do more beautification than usability. You need a different noun if you're truly doing real usability stuff, including the studies, heatmaps etc, that make up the UI Usability world's process.<p>>/UI/UX/Interaction design is a new thing<p>I'm going to disagree with you about this. It was a specialization in many schools by the end of the 90s in computer science departments (Called Human Computer Interaction). I have two very dear friends with degrees in it who are 29 and 32. Here is one such program: <a href=""http://www.gradadmiss.gatech.edu/programs/multidisciplinary/hci.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gradadmiss.gatech.edu/programs/multidisciplinary/...</a> Actual industrial design degrees (which are pretty applicable to software) have been around for decades.<p>There is a big difference between ""People who make things pretty"" and ""People who make things interact well with people"" and the training <i>is</i> different. Now if a person trained in one of those worked on self training the other, it still seems like calling themselves something acknowledging the dual nature of what they do: Something like UX Engineer and Graphic Designer would be more exact than the term ""UX Designer"" which in practice usually seems to mean ""Artist who makes things pretty then loudly, without good reasons, without a willingness to understand costs or decades of human/computer interaction, requires a large amount of authority acceded to him without further explanation and requires we do a lot of things just so without talking about tradeoffs because he doesn't seem to really have a mental model to talk about what he does so can't really compromise well and retailor his solutions to the issue"".<p>Those using the title often feels like people trained to do good art (even good commercial art) refusing to do a job and explain themselves when how they want their art animated doesn't actually make for good user interactions or would cost 3 arms and 3 legs more than the client has.<p>A lot of this is a function of how people without true backgrounds and training in design get into the field: the computing field is super tolerant of people not trained in this stuff but who get stuff done.  Happens with programming too. But programming is a little less tolerant of handwavy BS than art is (at a point, its a ""did it work"" thing which is somewhat demonstrable for programming). Where ""Did it work"" for design isn't really as testable without a user study. (I'm not saying non-trained by a college to do this thing shouldn't be in the field, just that they're less filtered).<p>Now, all of this isn't to mean: Designers shouldn't know the flow of what they're doing the art for. But until a designer show me a track record of UI improvement and comes equipped with the tools to show you made something better, lay off the misguided airs of certainty. Those tools exist. I feel if you can't use them, and can't prove yourself you got to let your client know this is most art than science and they should also really listen to other voices in the process.",1297869827

Any platform that sits in front (or ""top"" if you prefer) has the upper hand. Browsers sit on top of the operating system and Microsoft tried hard to dwarf browser growth as it threatened the OS itself. In fact, Java's ambitions were similar. Flash is just that. Adobe AIR has already made minor inroads. This is also in line with Jobs' decision to disallow Flash and Java.

Tons of software here are using bsd/mit licensed code and not releasing their change, that has nothing to do with corruption (or you don't understand what corruption is, go read a definition).<p>Using the GPL means you're free to use my code ...

2226589,comment,2226260,2226512,0,0,jedsmith,,,"I feel the same way about the GPL, in that it dictates very strong boundaries about what can and cannot be done with the code you are distributing. I don't personally feel that the tradeoff is acceptable to achieve a goal of <i>preventing corruption,</i> as you say, and it can be argued that the license indeed does prevent many freedoms to do what you will.<p>If I write software and distribute it as open-source on the Internet, I'm not interested in (a) suing those who don't follow my license to the letter à la gpl-violations.org, and (b) requiring you to release the source code to your product simply because you use mine. For those reasons, I will never apply the GPL to any of the software that I start, period.<p>It is my not job, as a software developer, to impose my beliefs upon you. The religious fervor in the GPL debates springs an interesting comparison to mind: the GPL is similar to publishing a book about Christ, and requiring those who read it to adopt Christianity. Viral open-source and the majority of the ""free software beliefs"" are just that, beliefs; I respect everyone's right to believe differently, and I will not mandate a belief in my software.<p>Why is a negative opinion about the GPL automatically assumed by you to be trolling? It does have flaws, and the GP simply expressed his distaste of them (perhaps not in the best way).",1297868646

2226581,comment,2223705,2225773,0,0,Silhouette,,,"I think perhaps you're seeing a false dichotomy here.<p>In a nutshell, we are new and high-tech, our competitors are established and low-tech, and we are aiming to solve essentially the same problem for mostly the same people in an easier way.<p>Perhaps a good analogy would be Netflix. They saw the potential for emerging technologies to disrupt an existing market and built a successful business around doing so, all but killing the old video rental store model in the process. What would have happened if, before Netflix had become established, one of the major rental store chains or perhaps a coalition of big movie studios had realised the potential of those new distribution models and the danger to the existing happy cash generators, and consequently thrown $100,000,000 into getting their own service off the ground? Whether or not the new distribution models ultimately took off, it's a good bet that the world would be a little less red today.<p>Now, we're building a different product and we're in a much smaller niche market, but the basic risk is the same: if an established dinosaur knew about the idea <i>and</i> realised the impact it could have on their happy cash generators, then it <i>would</i> make sense for them to move sideways and block us to retain their customer base, even if they would otherwise have no need to adapt their existing offering. They almost certainly don't know how to do that today, but they have so much more money than us that they could hire a dozen consultants until they found someone who did. Then they could afford to hire a team ten times our size to beat us to market, while using leverage from their existing network to make our lives difficult until our money ran out.",1297868569

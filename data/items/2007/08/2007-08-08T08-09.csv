40463,comment,40222,40263,0,0,niels,,,"I really like webpy and its open ended approach, but Django is just a more complete framework, and thats what I need for rapid development. django.contrib contains user/auth and other things I'd need to roll my own in webpy. And the middleware, like session stuff - beeing written for django - ties nicely in with all the helpers (generic views, etc..), while still being loosely coupled. Initially I thought that Django was mainly for news driven sites, but I find it to be just as flexible as Rails and more explicit and intuitive. So basically I'm looking for the solution that allows me to write the minimum amount of code, while still providing the flexibility I need. And of course it has to be Python (because that's what I prefer).",1186563222

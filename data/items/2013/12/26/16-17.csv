It doesn&#x27;t have to be theft, or murder, or an assault that makes you &quot;upset&quot; at them. Maybe you feel wronged because they said something in public that you wanted private.<p>Authorities have their place, but many problems can be solved by not involving them. I&#x27;d also say that many more problems are caused because people didn&#x27;t want to confront one another.",1388077192

If you are a white male then this is often the default choice because most systems in this country were designed by us for us.  If you grew up as a black male in America then you will probably think twice about involving the authorities because past experience shows a lower base probability of it working out in your favor.<p>More generally, working out issues directly with other human beings is a core skill that will serve you through your whole life.  Institutions and systems might be there to keep the peace, but they are big, slow and calcified to do things a certain way.  As an empathetic individual you are much more empowered to work things out with other individuals by gauging their perspective and where your mutual interests lie.  As the article describes, prison is a microcosm of this where you may literally live or die by your ability to navigate these waters, but make no mistake, you can use these skills every single day of your life, and geeks are often some of the worst in this area.",1388077099

Sinatra is very easy to navigate, and it&#x27;s implemented completely in just 5 files (could technically be more, base.rb is a little over 2k lines). While Scalatra here is a seeming explosion of libraries, tools, and the usual multi-nested Java directory structure.<p>From the little I do know about Scala, it seems to me like you should be able to make a full Sinatra clone in Scala in as many lines and files as Sinatra, or less.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to ask is this: If Scalatra is supposed to be &quot;Tiny&quot; why is it so big and complicated?<p>[1] <a href=\"https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra</a>",1388077075

The hackers and designers that startups want to hire seem to be disproportionately likely to want to travel on foot or by bike.  So they like to live in cities where you can do that, and dislike car-centric cities.<p>There is a bigger trend here though.  As several recent studies have shown, people in their 20s are turning against cars.

And for females, the pressure to get married before age 30.<p>Mind you--people in Japan are very smart. Science/math education is way better than in the US.

Unless said 22yr old had done some significant research, had an awesome open source project, is an all star Phd, then I&#x27;m temped to call bullshit on this one, and your acquaintance is blowing smoke up your ass. $200k base salary puts you into Level senior staff engineer/director software engineer territory. Most college grads AFAIK are slotted at 3-4 slots slower.  You&#x27;re effectively saying the person your aware of was hired almost as a Director level engineer at age 22. Most high level Google engineers are promoted at this level because of the cross-functional aspects of their experience -- they&#x27;ve taken the lead on several mid to large projects and worked across many Google product areas/teams.  Experience impossible to achieve in college.<p>To give you perspective, I&#x27;ve seen CEO and CTOs of acquired startups in the $50-100 million range can land at mid level engineering levels at Google.

Quite the opposite: Every post-mortem signifies that something has died. Resurrecting the dead has probably consumed a lot of time and resources that could have been better spent on something else.<p>An organization should never write the same post-mortem twice, and should see the rate of post-mortems diminish over time, to the point where they are incredibly rare. But that doesn&#x27;t always happen.<p>Instead, fetishizing post-mortems can be a real problem. It is easy to accidentally build an engineering culture that glorifies firefighting. Every day an expensive team of trained technicians comes to work and dives into the usual series of daily emergencies. Each emergency winds up with a glowing after-action report that gets filed with the other reports. People compete to tell the most entertaining tales of command-line heroics in the face of hilariously broken systems. It can actually be kind of fun, like a game. Everyone feels very productive and important, because without constant vigilance the software would die dozens of times every day. And the post-mortems may be of the highest quality, because every employee has ample opportunity to practice writing them.<p>In such an environment it&#x27;s astonishingly easy to lose the plot: It is better to be the organization whose software consistently works, and which never writes post-mortems because <i>nothing ever dies</i>.

The sort of applications that would typically use the NDK are games, emulators, VMs (like Xamarin.Android) and the like.<p>ObjC is also slow. Anytime you write something performance sensitive in ObjC, you usually drop down to pure C or pure C++. Luckily, since valid C is valid ObjC, this is rather easy.<p>Javascript and HTML is actually a great fit for mobile, but there are two complications. 1) You will have to mimick the UI of the native platform. 2) Mobile platforms have sub-par JS engines. iOS don&#x27;t allow JITs outside Safari (even when you use a webview in your ObjC app) which in turn makes JS-based apps in iOS slow.

Personally I think it is extremely disengeneous of him to say Europe wasn&#x27;t a problem for Ireland (and indeed there were major efforts to row back on the above comments subsequently). While there&#x27;s no doubt lax regulation of the banking sector was the major cause of Ireland&#x27;s problems initially, it is now widely accepted that the Irish Government was told in no uncertain terms by the ECB that it must bail out the banks on its own and that private bondholders were not to be touched, so as to prevent further contagion in the wider European banking sector. Thus an Icelandic style solution to Ireland&#x27;s problems was ruled out, on pain of withdrawal of all short term funding. Whatever the effects of burning private bondholders for Ireland&#x27;s future reputation in the markets, it would have been a much more just solution (as well as being popular politically in Ireland). To completely ignore the hit Ireland was forced to take is thus a bit rich IMHO.",1388073934

That is why they don&#x27;t enforce it regularly - because the customer blowback and holdups at the check-in are the airlines problem.

7718716,comment,7714400,7716652,2,0,muraiki,,,"Yes, there&#x27;s definitely room for dialogue between Orthodoxy and Zen (and many other eastern religions). In fact, I came to Orthodoxy from Buddhism in college via an excellent class that compared hesychast prayer to yoga. While I haven&#x27;t read this paper myself, it was written by my teacher and formed the theme of the class I took: <a href=""http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0350-0861/2008/0350-08610802171B.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0350-0861/2008/0350-08610...</a><p>Dogen&#x27;s Shobogenzo is interesting in that he is trying to convey the ineffable by abusing language. Perhaps from the viewpoint of Wittgenstein, Dogen is trying to break the language game. Then again I never got too far into it, so I might be misrepresenting it.<p>However, it&#x27;s important to note that in apophatic theology the intent isn&#x27;t to cut off discourse to the point where talking about God becomes empty of content completely. What saves the Christian from total unknowing is that the unknowable God has made Himself known through the Incarnation; Christ has shown the path to knowledge of the unknowable, which is the way of the cross: to account only oneself as deserving of death and to account all as worthy of the Kingdom. God is thus known in His energies (in a sense, actions) but unknown in His essence.<p>As such, Orthodoxy does maintain ideas of true and false, but with the twist that Truth is a Person. To conceive of it differently, truth is a relation between persons, in the sense of being the action of humble, selfless love. But I feel like now I&#x27;m saying too many words and only obscuring the meaning. :)",1399597117

It brings in loads of cash, but it&#x27;s a monopoly and the majors have little to no control (on price and promo, compared to retail). <p>So I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the labels are being somewhat difficult to Apple about streaming rights - they&#x27;ll dominate, and once again the labels lack control. <p>This deal could get round that somehow?<p>Add to that that I think the labels have vested interests in Spotify and very favourable deals, (while cautious of the streaming model) and it makes sense to not let another player in just yet, especially one like Apple. <p>Apples service is one that&#x27;ll ride roughshod over everything, installed instantly on 100&#x27;s of millions of devices with an iOS update - Sounds like a good use of their money to get that sooner rather than later. <p>I haven&#x27;t used Beats headphones but if their tech could be used to perceivably improve idevice&#x27;s and laptops built in speaker audio it&#x27;s a win there too. <p>I&#x27;ll believe it when I see it though.",1399597088

7718696,comment,7718056,7718056,4,0,bdamm,,,"Amazing how we assume there is a need to board the plane faster.  It likely doesn&#x27;t matter how quickly you can board the plane, since the process of loading luggage, fuel, and preparing the airplane for flight will still take as long as it does and often takes longer.  Have you ever sat in your seat and watched the baggage handlers load luggage?<p>Deplaning is another matter, of course, and generally I think that is actually quite efficient.  People who hold up the lines are usually embarrassed and therefore police themselves.  Every once in a while a fool holds up the line, but mostly each person adds no more time than the space ahead of them can allow.<p>Proof?

The US saw peak avaiation fuel in 1999, from the FAA&#x27;s own 2000 projections and actual usage[1].  Steve Kopits has noted that peak departures (US) occured in 2005[2].  Total passengers miles remain up, but that&#x27;s due to more efficient aircraft with higher load factors (a greater percentage of seats filled).<p>Even if synthetic fuels (possible) or biofuels (exceptionally unlikely) are possible for aviation, fuel costs (already a major component of airfare) will almost certainly rise.  The US Naval Research Lab thinks it might hit $3-6/gallon for production costs.  I suspect that&#x27;s optimistic and note that crude oil represents 72% of the final cost of refined gasoline, so this could translate to $4.17 - $8.33/gallon retail (present JetA price is $5.74 in the US NorthEast: <a href=""http://100ll.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://100ll.com/</a>). Canola biodiesel has a production cost of around $1000/bbl, or (with estimated refining costs) about $33/gallon.<p>A 3000 mile flight in a Boeing 777 at full capacity gets about 60 passenger miles/gallon, which equals 50 gallons of fuel per passenger.  That&#x27;s $287 presently, $415 at $8.33/gal, or $1650 at $33/gal, just for comparison, in fuel costs alone.<p>So, yes, exploring ground transit alternatives might make sense.<p>________________________________<p>1. <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/data_research/aviation/aerospace_forecasts/2001-2012/media/Table%2022.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faa.gov/data_research/aviation/aerospace_forecast...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://energypolicy.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/energy/Kopits%20-%20Oil%20and%20Economic%20Growth%20%28SIPA%2C%202014%29%20-%20Presentation%20Version%5B1%5D.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://energypolicy.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/energy/...</a> p. 37., citing US DoT.",1399594789

The same goes for prior warm-up, I don&#x27;t have to specify it here, I just show the loop). Because the result is needed to be shown, the browser is certainly not allowed to optimize away the calculation. Second, it&#x27;s not allowed to replace it with a multiplication, as it&#x27;s a floating point arithmetics and the binary representation of the constants involved is not &quot;nice&quot; an the same stands for partial results too. Do compare the result with the multiplication to get the idea (10000000.01 vs 9999999.99112945). All the additions have to be performed one way or another between the loading of the js and the displaying of the result. So it is a good measure of the quality of the translation from the js to the machine code which does the actual calculation and can also easily point to the unnecessary overheads as it&#x27;s very simple. The regression I observed is therefore a real one, probably observable in other scenarios but harder to pinpoint and probably avoidable, as the better results did exist once. (Of course, if it would be part of some widely popular benchmark cheats would probably be developed, but at the moment there aren&#x27;t any. Once anybody implements &quot;we don&#x27;t care for numerics&quot; optimization, it of course should not be used anymore to asses the quality of JS).",1399594646

Maybe you have an interesting point to make?)<p>Re: etymology, it&#x27;s pretty much &quot;think => exist.&quot;<p>Re: conceptual level: well, one of the texts where this whole concept/causal-chain is introduced is in his &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;[1], in particular, in Meditation 2.<p>Very (very) roughly (and from bad memory), the idea is that one can first start casting into doubt everything that there is (skepticism as a method) (this is Meditation 1.) When you abstract enough times, you can start doubting even the certainty of things which may seem true in themselves (this latter notion is an endless field of debate in itself; see e.g. Quine&#x27;s &quot;Two Dogmas of Empiricism&quot;[2]) - cliche example is &quot;2+2=4.&quot;<p>Say there&#x27;s a deceitful daemon: each time the thought &quot;2+2&quot; is produced, the daemon &quot;intercepts&quot; the answer and produces a &quot;5&quot;. (Yes, I&#x27;m saying that Descartes may be one of the originators of the concept of a MitM, ha!) (Also, this doesn&#x27;t work so well with mathematics, since again, one could say that mathematical statements are &quot;analytically true&quot;, and it&#x27;s simply not true that one may mistake a &quot;5&quot; for a &quot;4&quot;. But imagine something more mundane: each time you think if there is a god, the daemon deceives you into thinking there isn&#x27;t one; whatnot.)<p>So now you generalize the doubt process enough to start doubting whether <i>anything</i> exists, what-so-ever. The point is not so much in thinking that there isn&#x27;t anything, but in removing <i>certainty</i> from usual ontological assumptions (what (kinds of) things exist.)<p>So now you&#x27;re not certain if there is an &quot;I&quot;: you are able to doubt it.<p>But then Descartes says that this very process of certainty-removal requires an operation (he doesn&#x27;t use these words, did I say this is extremely rough): namely, the &quot;doubt&quot; itself. &quot;Doubts are to be had.&quot;<p>Or, if you will (and closer to D. (I think)): if an evil daemon can cast into doubt even the existence of your own self - it it can deceive everything, etc. - there needs to be a something to be deceived. Or at the very least, <i>the process of deception (or: of doubt) does happen</i> (if you want to cast everything into doubt.)<p>So if you doubt that anything exists and hence can not be certain of anything, then it so happens that this requires doubt &quot;to happen.&quot; Hence &quot;doubt exists.&quot; (He also says (I think) that, basically, &quot;clearly since I am doubting right now, <i>doubt does happen</i>&quot;. A kind of phenomenological argument, which doesn&#x27;t really stick with me, fwiw. He then starts using the notion of &quot;clear and distinct perception&quot;, and that&#x27;s where things go downhill imho (Meditation 3, a (kind of circular) proof of God, etc.) But I have few qualms about Meditation 2, and this includes cogito ergo sum.)<p>(You could say that the only thing one can be certain of is that &quot;there are thoughts&quot; (not an &quot;I&quot;). I would agree with this. &quot;Thinking exists.&quot; And since &quot;thinking&quot; would be, well, thinking this thought, it is certain that &quot;thinking exists.&quot;)<p><i>edited to include two paragraphs (this+next one):</i> So now we (hopefully) have something that exists for certain; thoughts exist (or somesuch.) Descartes claims a bit more: this entity that does the thinking (there does need to be an agent which thinks those thoughts (is what he assumes, I guess)) - let us just say it is &quot;I&quot;, who does the thinking/doubting - when we trace back the process by which we concluded that we are certain that it exists - involves us discovering that thinking/doubting definitely does take place. Hence &quot;I think; I exist.&quot;<p>(I suppose you could have a concept of an &quot;I&quot; that is simply instrumental (doesn&#x27;t have independent substance (oof, this is dangerous/slippery territory)): thoughts can have relations, and related thoughts can be seen as &quot;bundles&quot;, and this process producing continuing interrelated bundles is &quot;the I doing the thinking.&quot; But, I&#x27;m not sure of this at all. Maybe D. would say that the deceiving daemon needs to deceive something, if it does actually do any deceiving; and if this does happen, then this &quot;something&quot; which is being deceived is (let us call it an) &quot;I&quot;.)<p>Now, to go from cogito ergo sum to proof of God and subsequent re-establishment of certainty about the whole world - that is something else. And I don&#x27;t think that he does a very good job at it. (And this is &quot;usually&quot;, &quot;generally&quot; agreed upon.)<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Meditations_on_First_Philosophy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Meditations_on_First_Philosop...</a> - which btw is an easier read than you might think, if you&#x27;re curious enough!<p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html</a>",1399594283

7718550,comment,7717317,7717654,4,0,msandford,,,"There&#x27;s also the way the business evolved.  Manufacturers don&#x27;t have unlimited funds to:<p>1) design cars<p>2) design factories<p>3) manufacture cars<p>4) retail cars<p>So somewhere along the line someone figured out that cars are somewhat commodity, same as  clothing or food.  A grocery store sells several brands of food and department stores sell several brands of clothing.  Cars could be done the same way.<p>Manufacturers liked it because it allowed them to grow much faster by selling franchise licenses and use that money for design of cars, factories and to actually build cars.  It&#x27;s an all around win.<p>But eventually manufacturers grow to the point where they aren&#x27;t starved for capital anymore, have good market penetration and growth starts to slow.  So a natural next step is to cut out the middlemen (the dealers who have paid franchise fees) and start direct-to-consumer sales efforts.  This idea didn&#x27;t sit well with the dealers who had paid those franchise fees and might have assumed they could amortize them over many years.<p>So laws got passed preventing manufacturers from competing with the dealers that they had sold franchises to.<p>But Tesla has never sold anyone a franchise ever.  They&#x27;re not doing naughty things to their former customers (the dealers) because they&#x27;ve never had dealers.<p>REQUIRING them to sell only to dealers doesn&#x27;t make sense unless you&#x27;re worried about Ford doing some kind of shady restructuring to get themselves out of all their dealer contracts and to start selling direct to consumers.",1399594242

Essentially it is whether the language defers all errors to run-time or attempts to detect classes of them at compile-time.  A language like JavaScript accepts as a program any string that parses, while a language like Java rejects many strings based on additional checks such as type rules.  You can add static type-checking to JavaScript or Python, but it isn&#x27;t part of the language spec.  You can run C++ or Java with run-time type-checking, but it doesn&#x27;t conform the to spec.  In this way you could say that the language is fundamentally compiled or interpreted.<p>Of course, this doesn&#x27;t address issues of incremental evaluation which often requires additional semantics for compiled languages.",1399593849

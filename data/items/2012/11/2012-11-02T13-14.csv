As all the linux distros using PGP signing demonstrate, people don't bother to verify the key, they just accept it blindly and assume everything is cool.  Since only 1 out of a million people ask for this, and of those only 1 out of a million would actually go through the correct procedure rather than just grabbing the key from the same place they are grabbing the binaries and not verifying it in any way, it isn't worth the effort.  The 0.001% of the 0.001% already have the tools available to verify, it is just a bit of a pain to do.  It isn't worth it for the openbsd devs to waste time making it easier for those people who wouldn't verify the key anyways to feel secure when they would be exactly as secure as they are now.

That it <i>can't</i> work in certain cases and that we'll always <i>need</i> mice.  And all that in a complaint that demonstrated a pretty narrow understanding of what has already been done with touch interfaces.<p>It was never my intention to argue that touch is always the <i>preferable</i> interface for all workloads (something I tried to convey by pointing out how mice will remain relevant for quite some time, due entirely to day-long workloads).<p>As applies to your concerns, I was just trying to suggest that workable solutions exist, even if they'll always be less-than-ideal for larger quantities of work.<p>As to your specific concern, I still think a workable solution may be out there, even if it remains undoubtedly less efficient than a mouse and a larger screen.<p>e.g.
Wouldn't the sorts of drag and off-axis drag controls that are used for seek in many podcast/audio-player apps [1] address precision-selection in cases where too-much-zoom presents problems, and also obviate the concern about fingers obscuring the wave itself?<p>[1] click to 'grab' the selection-marker/nubby on the wave/timeline, drag across the x axis to seek and then <i>down</i> on the y axis to control the speed of seek -- typically doing more and more fine-grained seek for a given x-axis drag length, as the finger gets further from the wave/timeline",1351864502

I am walking on eggshells right now for I can not express myself freely in a forum like this without suffering from social manipulation (downvoting, hellbanning). And this is <i>while</i> adhering to practices such as ""no personal insults"". In a place like this, you get banned for disagreeing, let alone speaking in an ""unapproved"" way. This place is hardly an example of civility.<p>I agree that there is a middle ground - when someone's quality of life is seriously suffering because, for example, someone is shouting abuse at them all day then something must be done. However, taking serious offence at people's ignorant opinions or ways of expression is unwise and in itself ignorant.<p>I'm anticipating prejudice so I shall address it pre-emptively - I am, in fact, a minority. In many places on this planet, I risk serious injury just for being what I am. People have expressed extremely ignorant opinions about the group I fall under in workplaces. I initially took offence upon hearing what I heard but then I moved past that stage and accepted that one cannot understand something they haven't dealt with directly.

This meme is repeated often, but few people actually explain what it means.</i><p>Basically males often do not have to put with things that women often do. The concrete example is in this article. If you're a male contracter and start in a new IT place, and the other co-workers know nothing else about you beside (a) you're working here and (b) you are male, then they are much less likely to presume you are not a programmer than if you were female. See the OP for more examples of IT.<p>In general terms, some other examples:<p> If a man gets drunk and passes out at a party, he rarely has to worry about more than someone shaving his eyebrows/hair or someone writing on his face with a marker. Women have to worry about being sexually molested or rape.<p> If a straight man goes to a bar, and doesn't want to meet a new person, he's much more likely to be left alone and not propositioned than a woman. (i.e. he can have a quite drink with/without friends without being interrupted). If a straight man wants to experience more of what women feel, go to a gay bar.<p> A man can walk past a building site (say) with it being unlikely that someone will shout something suggestive at him.<p> When it's dark and they've had a beer or two, a man has a wider selection of streets he can walk down to get home. Less hassle, take the direct route! (I know men are often victims of other kinds of attacks & robberies, that doesn't mean they are not less likely to suffer other kinds).<p> A straight man is much less likely to be the victim of physical or sexual abuse from his spouse than a straight woman.<p>etc.<p>This is what I mean by ""men have it easier (in some regards)""",1351861803

Powershell is not. It's wordy and verbose, C# style. It makes things complex because it's not easy to find what you're looking for. Object piping might be nice, but not when you have to get all files and pipe them into a get-modified-date thing and pipe the date objects into a date-to-text object instead of ls -...<p>As a programming language, it's seriously ugly. It could have been VBScript slid towards Python, instead it's C# slid towards Perl.

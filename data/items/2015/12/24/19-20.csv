But that is not what is happening. What if the code contains &quot;x/y&quot;? Now, the compiler can try to prove that x and y can never be 0 at the same time. But what if that proof doesn&#x27;t succeed? Maybe x is user input, so who knows what the user will enter at runtime? Now, the language spec could specify that the computation of 0/0 always results in a runtime error. But if it did that, there might be target architectures where the code that would need to be generated to check for that case would have a 300% performance overhead versus code that does unpredictable stuff when it gets fed 0 for both x and y, but in every other case performs a perfectly predictable division. That slowdown would be inacceptable for computation-intensive code where a 0/0 could never happen by construction, even though the compiler can&#x27;t prove it.

10789359,comment,10786512,10788057,0,0,rswier,,,"In the future I believe you are going to see less emphasis on the aggressive speedup of C code for traditional CPUs. Instead you will see many more gadgets with simpler processors that run C code slower in the effort to save power. GPGPUs and algorithm specific hardware (e.g. video, crypto, network, DSP, neural nets) will fill out the rest of the chip.  At some point GPUs will have enough raw power and GP features for it to be possible to run an instance of a late-80&#x27;s operating system within the working set of a single GPU processing element (perhaps with virtual memory emulated as in jslinux.) At that point the need for a power hungry CPU and artificial CPU/GPU distinction will start to fade away completely. Along with Peak Oil we will have Peak CPU.<p>So, in general I am saying that the road to better performance will not be in aggressive compiler optimization, but rather in higher level design tools to manage totally new software/hardware abstractions. Binaries will be specified at a higher level and look more like source code.  At this point my crystal ball becomes admittedly a bit fuzzy.",1450986072

10789350,comment,10787283,10787601,0,0,potatolicious,,,"Sure, but the odds aren&#x27;t 10% or 40%, they&#x27;re more on the order of 1% to 3%. If you can pick winners at a 40% rate, you&#x27;re doing orders of magnitude better than even the top VCs in the industry, and your talent is worth billions.<p>Realistically nobody plays at those odds, the actual odds being played are much, much lower.<p>Which also means that, even through a long career, you&#x27;re not taking on enough jobs to get a reasonable shot at a win - 10 jobs with a 2% chance of winning each aren&#x27;t good odds - you have a 18% chance of scoring a win.<p>All the while you&#x27;re giving up a lot of money to do so - BigCo&#x27;s will pay you easily $100-200k more <i>per year</i>. So even if you switch jobs yearly, 10 jobs = 10 years = $1-2M on the table to play for 18% odds.<p>Which is also why investors who are able to choose well win - YC for example invests in over 200 companies a year. Unless you&#x27;re switching jobs every week you&#x27;re not going to be able to raise N high enough to make a difference - at YC&#x27;s scale a 2% chance of winning for each company means there&#x27;s a 98% chance at least one company wins.<p>The entire idea here is that nobody has predictive power high enough to the degree of 10% vs. 40%. Realistically when choosing between two competing startups you&#x27;re choosing success odds in the low single digits.<p>Not to mention the rash of articles in the past week about the low payouts you&#x27;re likely to get even if the company succeeds. Engineers don&#x27;t walk away from modern startups with 7-figure payouts, low 6-figures is more likely. So realistically even if you are able to pick companies at a 40% accuracy (again, astronomically higher than reality) your expected payout is lower than the $1-2M you&#x27;re leaving on the table in order to play.",1450985842

As part of the tagout, he checks that the ship&#x27;s DC bus is deenergized - within the battery breaker box itself.  During the check, he finds some voltage, which isn&#x27;t entirely unexpected, since there is enough capacitance on the DC bus to hold it charged for a while.  So he uses a specialized grounding probe - about 1/8&quot; diameter copper rod with a reinforced handle - to discharge it.  Unfortunately, he has misunderstood what was inside the breaker box and is actually shorting out the ship&#x27;s main battery!  This is a couple hundred volts DC, and a few thousand amp-hours of capacity, and it delivers enough current to instantly vaporized the grounding rod.  He&#x27;s knocked on his ass by the arc blast.  Fortunately, he was correctly considering the box to be energized gear and was wearing a full set of PPE, suffering only minor flash damage to his eyes.",1450985617

ALL hiring procedures sometimes miss good workers, and all hiring procedures sometimes result in hiring lousy workers, but if you want to optimize, the way to optimize is to hire workers who are good at doing the specific tasks you are hiring for (that&#x27;s what a work-sample test shows you) and how have good general cognitive ability, which shows as well as any indicator that they can learn to do new tasks in the future. References to the research literature are available in my previous comment, linked in the footnote. Anything else you do in hiring, for whatever reason, has less benefit to your company than checking whether job candidates can do the job tasks and checking whether the job candidates are smart or dull.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4613543"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4613543</a>",1450983889

A Word and PDF version should be no more than 2 sides of A4, with the page break at a logical place. HTML should be interactive, with widgets that show relevant content.<p>Web design is fundamentally different to print design, and your CV should show that you understand that. So you should be able to make a Word version save that to PDF, then re-write and redesign the content for the web page.",1450983681

You are right, entrepreneurial ambition is not the same as the Valley Ponzi scheme, but SV is exactly about funneling that ambition into a wealth-generating machine for the investor class, and most of the ambition in the Valley is captured and squandered this way. I would rather err by calling this out.",1450983655

I&#x27;ve written about it elsewhere with regards to having no degree vs having one, but it applies to MS vs BS and standard state school vs top-tier just as well.<p>It&#x27;s another form of social proof, and it affects not just whether or not you get hired, but how people view you, speak to you, and whether / how much they listen to or consider your opinion. Of course, many people don&#x27;t give degrees a second thought, but for every one of those, there are plenty who do.",1450983654

With no reference point for keeping the head still, some subjects end up leaning forward slightly after the ball is released... you can guess the result.",1450983634

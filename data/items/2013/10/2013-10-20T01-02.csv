I think.<p>So state would be dealt with in a similar approach than the command pattern?<p>Sounds exciting.<p>I guess where I come from is the scare when a pure function gets littered with impurity much later on, and all we have to warn us is a unit test. No matter how big the comment is above the method, nothing stops a developer from sticking a global variable in it, and it&#x27;s out the window.<p>This forces code reviews to be lengthy, etc. If on the other hand we had a @pure section and @everything_else section, I feel this would make things easier to reason about... We could also measure the % of pure vs non-pure code, as code quality. All of this in an object oriented language of course. I&#x27;m no fan of Haskell.",1382234226

6578704,comment,6578460,6578460,8,0,ACow_Adonis,,,"One is reminded of other fictional works such as American Psycho, by Brett Easton Ellis.  These works are valuable to read not because they are overly pleasant, but specifically because they are such transparent and horrific reflections of the inner mental state of the narrator.  Such a state is then projected onto the mind of the reader so effectively that the disgust and alienation you feel while reading the book is effectively the same disgust and alienation internalised at all times by the novel&#x27;s protagonist.<p>In this the DSM-V is another brilliant piece of fictional writing.  A world where everything is classified, pathologised, and detached from its context, values, society, and causes.  During the entire tome, you are completely separated from any notion of wellness, love, morality, or healthy human beings, with everything classified and filed away like a work-bench with little boxes for every possible failing.<p>It finally hits you as you feel so disgusted and alienated by the conclusion of the novel...that this is specifically because the narrator is so alienated and separated from such realities, and the novel has succeeded perfectly in its goal.  To put you in such a tortured, flawed, and erroneous mindset that you now understand completely the flawed and erroneous mindset and worldview of the narrator.<p>Kudos to the author.  Another masterpiece.",1382233846

6578702,comment,6578460,6578460,30,0,chimeracoder,,,"> caffeine intoxication disorder.<p>As someone who mostly appreciated the DSM-IV (though recognized its shortcomings), this is my biggest concern with the DSM-V, and why I consider it to be a step backwards in many ways.<p>CAVEAT: My understanding of the DSM-V is based on earlier drafts/non-final editions, so some of these details may be stale, but it appears the general principles that I object to haven&#x27;t changed.<p>The DSM-IV-TR was very specific with its definitions of &quot;substance abuse&quot; and &quot;substance dependence&quot;. My main complaint with the former was the way two of the criteria were poorly worded. It referred to the amount of legal trouble and/or risk that the person took to obtain the drug and could, if <i>very</i> broadly (mis-)interpreted, be used to identify any user of any illegal drug as suffering from &quot;substance abuse&quot; just by definition[0]. This is mostly a quibble about the wording of one detail, though; I think that these were good definitions overall and were more helpful than not.<p>Criticially, the DSM-IV-TR was able to distinguish between casual users of a drug (be it caffeine, alcohol, marijuana, heroin, etc.) and those who actually suffered from &quot;addition&quot; (a term I put in scare quotes because it does not have a medical definition, unlike the words &quot;abuse&quot; and &quot;dependence&quot;).<p>This is a <i>crucial</i> distinction. If you send someone who drinks infrequently but is not an alcoholic to rehab, you are providing treatment for a disorder that they do not have. Thus, you wouldn&#x27;t be surprised (or concerned) to find their behavior unchanged six months later. You would not consider it a &quot;relapse&quot; if they continued to drink infrequently.<p>Unfortunately, the DSM-V turns this on its head, by allowing &quot;fill-in-the-blank&quot; intoxication disorders. Think of generic classes in Java - they work the same way. Given the name of any drug, you can provide the corresponding disorder - in this case, &quot;caffeine intoxication disorder&quot;, or &quot;marijuana abuse syndrome&quot;[1]<p>The problem with the new wording is that it encourages over-diagnosis of mental disorders. Instead of requiring a professional to distinguish between disorders and non-disorders (easy), it lumps all together as disorders, and requires professionals to distinguish between those which require treatment and those which don&#x27;t (hard).<p>This is not only more difficult medically, but more problematic legally. No doctor or hospital wants to accept the liability of saying that they saw a patient <i>previously diagnosed</i> with a disorder and then determined that they didn&#x27;t need treatment. This is far worse than simply failing to diagnose a disorder.<p>This may seem like a minor point, but it&#x27;s not. We&#x27;ve been struggling with issues of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of non-disorders (not just drug-related) for years; in a very subtle way, the DSM-V further entrenches this problem.<p>[0] Incidentally, DSM-V <i>did</i> drop the &quot;legal trouble&quot; criterion.<p>[1] I forget the exact wording of the latter; this was a while ago and I believe they changed it.",1382233796

Analogously, sex tourists share responsibility, as perhaps do other governments whose actions influence the kind of governments that Thailand is likely to have.<p>Just a minor point of mine on a side-observation!

Try writing a type checker or even a parser with pure functions, and you get to a point where you are passing in your state from the top anyways (either as a monad or explicitly). Many interesting computations simply aren&#x27;t pure.<p>> Separating the grok of the code from the state eventually helps. And sadly there is little research spent in there, which is direct value to developers.<p>I would argue that there is plenty of research in this direction in the functional programming community. This is what monads seem to be about, at any rate. The problem is that developers don&#x27;t want to adopt these solutions because they are way too inconvenient or even unworkable from an expressiveness standpoint. So maybe we should look for a better way to temper state without throwing it into a ghetto...<p>> I am amazed with what you can do though. I&#x27;ve had my shot at designing a language and miserably failed multiple times... But this why I&#x27;m raving about it... You may be able to solve this global problem that I never could.<p>We will see; I went through my purity stage relatively early and am being extremely pragmatic these days.

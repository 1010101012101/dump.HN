I wanted to get the mvp out to my HN buddies as a pre-cursor to enlisting some feedback out in the wild. As soon as possible, I'll be trying to get some real-life use cases going on, and I'll be able to show ""real"" demos =). Thanks again.",1259229351

It has been said that writing a letter to a dead relative can be a cathartic experience despite the intended recipients of the letter never reading the contents.

They just make great homework assignments for junior officers, for the same reason that ""Write a plan for defending the United States from a sudden attack by space aliens"" does.  You can discuss whatever you want in the homework assignment and do it to any level of detail, but if it leaks, national security is not threatened.<p>Compare that to this: ""The Pentagon has produced detailed plans for a nuclear attack on Tehran in response to Iran' bioterrorism, the New York Times has learned.""  That sort of thing starts wars, and the relevant people don't listen to ""Oh for pity's sake, I just wanted Captain McSweeny to get some practice writing out nuclear logistics scenarios.  We're not going to actually nuke... hold on a second...  I can neither confirm nor deny that we might nuke Tehran in response to a WMD attack.""",1259227647

962467,comment,960163,961624,0,0,dgreensp,,,"SwellJoe, I'm with you in that the ""debunkers"" seem quite dogmatic.  Then there are people who have had personal success with polyphasic sleep and rave about it, typically doing it for a period of months but not on a permanent basis.  Science doesn't have a lot to say, and everyone else is left wondering what to think.<p>References I found enlightening about the actual practice of it (in favor of it) are the book Ubersleep:<p><a href=""http://www.lulu.com/content/2649551"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lulu.com/content/2649551</a><p>and Hacker News threads like this one:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=673726"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=673726</a><p>I've read enough anecdotal evidence to be convinced that when it polyphasic sleep works, it works -- that after a potentially rough (and potentially impossible, depending on the person) period of adaptation, the practitioner is not significantly impaired in day-to-day functioning.  Skeptics' arguments usually boil down to ""it's unnatural"", ""you can't get something for nothing"", or ""it didn't work for me"".<p>In terms of needing to set an alarm, I don't know if the body can learn a polyphasic schedule or not; even if it can, the reasons busy monophasic people use alarms to regulate their sleep would apply all the more so to polyphasic sleepers, and I get the sense polyphasic sleep is a sort of ""unstable equilibrium"";  and if the body can't learn it, that still doesn't mean it's unnatural.<p>Science could come along and discover a long-term deleterious effect of getting so little sleep, in which case I'd be all ears, but it seems doubtful.  I hope the science catches up, though, and we figure out what the deal is with sleep, so we don't have to argue quite so irrationally.  There's a lot of interesting recent work on whether being unconscious for eight hours is mostly a behavioral adaptation rather than a biological necessity.<p>My general philosophy is ""if it works, do it"", and it definitely works in some instances.  Reducing total time spent sleeping per day isn't like smoking cigarettes, it isn't going to slowly poison you.  Lots of people get very poor sleep and are definitely impaired during the day, more so than a skilled polyphasic sleeper would report, and they aren't doing long-term damage.",1259227298

They are incentivized by fame and grant money to produce studies with a wow factor. Climatologists skeptical of global warming are outcasts among their peers - the leaked CRU emails illustrate this, as well as, intimidation to scholarly journals that publish skeptical papers.<p>I am not a climatologist, but I've done some complicated math simulations in college and there is no way you can future predictions look like these - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Global_Warming_Predictions.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Global_Warming_Predictions...</a> - how the fuck do you have squiggly lines, not a range, after 20 years from now - fails the common sense test.<p>Plus, can any non PhD even get access to a scientific journal?

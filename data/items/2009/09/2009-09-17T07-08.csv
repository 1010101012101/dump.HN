Unless a specific inner loop of the program shows up in a profiler as the hotspot because of an exception, this just isn't something you should ever worry about in 99% of code.  Don't throw out the nice abstractions that make code simple unless you know for sure it's the actual problem, rarely is that the case for throwing exceptions.  In this particular instance, I'd say you're just wrong about not using an exception.",1253174193

What is certain, though, is that Be, as both a business and a technology, and Gassée as an individual, are exponentially less successful now (by standard business metrics, not necessarily in a deeper sense) than they would have been had Gassée said yes.

827644,comment,826098,827144,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,">>How important is physical proximity, really?<p>First off, high frequency traders are making their money off of how quickly they react to the market conditions.  The quicker they react, the more money they make.  In this sense, if they trade at high enough volume, it's worth paying more for a lower latency.  This is, of course, assuming they are good at what they do.  If they are bad at what they do, a lower latency wouldn't harm.<p>Second, they are in a competitive environment.  If they want to make money off of obvious arbitrages that their competitors are likely engaged in as well (very likely in the forex market), they need to react <i>first</i>.<p>I assume that physical proximity reduces latency in ways other than the time it takes for photons to travel through fiber optic cable, for example router hops.<p>>> On: Trading success based on latency<p>In Forex (the currency exchange), there are sometimes very obvious arbitrage opportunities.  You can take your Dollar, and trade it into Euros.  Then, go from Euros to Yen.  Then, go from Yen back to Dollar -- and end up with more dollars than you started with!  Of course, after a certain amount of money flows through, the market will adjust itself and the arbitrage will vanish.<p>Being the first to react to this arbitrage allows you to realize and profit from the arbitrage before anybody else does.",1253173673

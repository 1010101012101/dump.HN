2577569,comment,2577186,2577501,2,0,cookiecaper,,,"The reality is that there is generally a lot of leeway in ""fair"" as far as contracts go. You can definitely sign an intentionally adversarial contract and it will usually hold up. I have only known courts to nullify contracts when they specifically violate a given law; for instance, a contract where one side can kill the other side in event of breach would not be valid because it runs afoul of murder/assault laws. However, a contract where an exorbitant fee is levied upon one side in event of breach would generally be held as long as all parties were deemed capable of understanding the contract and endorsing it by their own free will (i.e., not under duress) when it was signed.<p>IANAL, this whole post may be and probably is wrong.

It is intended to help protect your wallet.  A better way to protect your health is to take care of yourself so you are healthy.  The discussion in the US about ""the healthcare crisis"" always focuses on the financial piece of it.  There are differences between Europe and the US that impact health having nothing to do with who pays the medical bills: Europe is generally more pedestrian-friendly, there is a different food culture and so on.  All of those things impact health.  I get tired of seeing ""health insurance"" held up as a) the only meaningful difference in health costs between the US and Europe and b) the only important part of ""how to control medical costs"" in the US debate on health care.<p>That's why I bring it up:  Because to me the two things are related.",1306184338

If your conclusion is that ""driving on the PCH in a convertible is fun"" then, no, you don't need many participants or any scientific rigor.  But if you're say things like ""the roads aren't wide enough"" or ""radios are too loud"" or ""signs aren't big enough"" then you're going to need to back that up with some context and some data.<p>My beef here is that people who don't want to really think about this stuff but want to seem like they do will read articles like his, which draw conclusions of the latter type described above, and spout them off as authoritative science, because that's how it's presented by Jakob Nielsen, Ph. D. This confuses clients and teams and ends up having people defend their decisions against a ghost of a misinterpretion of a supposed rule, and ultimately yields an inferior product.

A few years ago I spent some time digging through official government reports on healthcare in several (well limited to English speaking) countries and found things like >8 hour wait times for emergency services, >30 day waits (in some places) for some non-emergency services, etc.  Yes, we pay more, but the flip side of that is faster access even in non-critical situations.

You can certainly argue that multiple dispatch, as it exists in CLOS is not object oriented, but it is possible to have ""object-oriented"" multiple dispatch.<p>VB.NET is a good example.<p>The ""late bound"" dispatcher in VB.NET will:<p>1) Dynamically construct a ""method-group"" using the runtime type of a receiver of a method call. This collects all appropriately named instance methods in the receiver type and  any of it's base types.<p>2) Dynamically perform overload resolution using the runtime type of each method argument. This behaves like the static overload resolution done in the compiler except that it\nuses dynamic types, rather than static types, and happens at runtime. It also doesn't consider extension methods.<p>In any case, this yields method dispatch that varies dynamically based on the runtime type of multiple arguments. It is very similar to multi-methods in CLOS, except that preference is given to the receiver  over other parameter types, and that you can't override a ""multi-method"" without modifying the definition of at least one type.",1306181432

Scheme (R5RS) is a good example of a minimalist language that <i>isn't</i> necessarily easy to read when compared with Python's readability; same is said about its ""learnability"".<p>I nitpicked those features because while I would agree list comprehensions aren't as readable/learnable to a new user, they <i>do</i> make the language simpler in that it increases the expressiveness of the language for a common pattern. To each his own, I like both list comprehensions and map() - not sure if I really take a side on either one...<p>My example of xrange() in arguing for generators was a bad one because you're right, it is an iterator. I still feel like generators increase the expressivity of the language and therefore make it ""simpler"" - but again I will agree with you that new users will find it less readable and less learnable (to begin with though!).<p>Decorators I will completely agree, are new user unfriendly and are a complex language feature - I suppose I was arguing for reduced <i>program</i> complexity rather than <i>language</i> simplicity in the context of the decorator addition.",1306180886

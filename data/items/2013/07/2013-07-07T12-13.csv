Its basic functioning is spelled out precisely in 5 through 8 of the G10 Act [1]. This law is hardly uncontroversial, but it is not as though anybody can claim to have been surprised by it; its provisions are well known and frequently and hotly debated.<p>Regarding information-sharing with the NSA: The law allows the result of 5 surveillance only to be shared with foreign agencies under the conditions of 7a and 8. In particular, this means that all such information sharing has to be reported to the parliamentary commission and the commission has to inform the public about the amount of information sharing that occurred. For 2009-2011 (2011 is the year covered by the most recent report) no such information sharing was reported to have occurred.<p>Now, if the BND broke that law and shared information with the NSA without telling the parliamentary commission, then this would surprise just about nobody.

What does coinbase do? They let you use ACH for getting money in and out of the exchange. It is the reason they are successful, it is also the reason they will fail.<p>How does it work? You create a coinbase account, you then link this unverified account with your bank account using these 2 options: 1.you can hand over your online banking u/p for instant verification or 2. you give them your account # + routing number for them to make 2 small deposits to verify that it is in fact your account.

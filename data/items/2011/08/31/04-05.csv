As of halfway through this month they basically stopped buying display ad inventory -- this is from the US side of things. I think they are buying more display internationally (which I am no expert on.)<p>Hitwise, Quantcast, Comscore, by themselves don't mean too much. When you combine them all together and you look at traffic numbers for really giant web sites they are pretty close to being accurate.<p>I was pretty optimistic about the daily deal sites, but Groupon (and LivingSocial to a degree as well) pulling back on their ad campaign coverage so dramatically is not a good signal. The other competitors that were spending early on (late last year) did not last very long, and it was a good signal of things to come.<p>Groupon has a great business model, but as with any business model that relies on buying tons of ad inventory it raises your profile too big too fast. That in exchange explodes your ad costs and eliminates your margins. At the end of the day Google and website publishers end up the winner. That's one of the reason I've split my business across lots of different websites. Had I not, I don't think I would have been able to keep it running profitably.<p>Update -- here is something to take a look at. Earlier this year InAdCo was running display campaigns on behalf of Groupon on a massive scale, chances are if you were using the internet you saw these ads more than once(they had some fancy in-ad signup form) If you take a look at their traffic on quantcast it had a huge spike April-May and then went to nothing <a href=""http://www.quantcast.com/inadcoads.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quantcast.com/inadcoads.com</a> The traffic returns in May, but as I recall it was pushing LivingSocial at that point.

The reason Google is in this position is because they have figured out how to most profitably use the content generated by others. As their market share increased and they rolled out more and more products (Adwords, Gmail, Google documents, Google+) they became more effective at presenting ads to us, for their ""customers"", i.e. their advertisers. Their ""product"" is us, the punters hitting the big ""search"" button.<p>Google has become such a dominant force in advertising that it would be inconceivable for any business with any sort of online presence not to have some advertising via Google.<p>I think this is what Mr. Lanier means when he says: ""The use of networks can turn you from a local player in a larger system into your own global system.""<p>I agree with him. Google has gone from being one of a multitude of search engines about 8 years ago to becoming an eco-system in it's own right; and Mr. Lanier argues (and I concur) that it is ultimately to our detriment.",1314765187

It doesn't work for convincing people, and it doesn't work as a matter of practice the vast majority of the time anyway. Take a straw man: the human species joins together and pools all our resources and the planet's resources into some giant project that, while lots of credible people claim is very unlikely, everyone helps out anyway. But it doesn't work out, and by the time we call it quits we're so starved for resources that we go extinct. Repeat with variations in as many hypothetical worlds as you wish, and maybe 1 or 2 get it right and the payoff was totally worth it because it made humans rulers of the universe or something. That's not a good gamble.<p>Do you believe that if the possible positive utility to be gained wasn't so vast, we shouldn't do scientific research because then the improbability of that utility and/or the costs that factor in begin to weigh on it? If so, that's an interesting belief.

It's almost gratifying, definitely exhilarating, to know that particle physics is still a fresh frontier with plenty of territory to be discovered. Supersymmetric particles seem to be unlikely too. It seems like we're almost back at the drawing board.<p>So if it turns out that it doesn't exist, where do we go from here? What are the alternative theories? It's been a while since I went into particle physics at all deeply, so I don't know all the leading theories and their pros and cons.",1314763675

Everything that&#x27;s followed is my insistence that not smoking is an option. I have made no claims to the ease or feasibility of it as an option.<p>I&#x27;ve made no claim for or against e-cigarettes. I&#x27;ve made no claim for or against smoking in general in this thread. The only claims I&#x27;ve made are that not smoking is an option. The reason I made that claim was, as stated above, the original comment failed to mention that not smoking was an option.<p>On the car front, yes, cars are bad, I agree, wholeheartedly, but America made a decision to emphasize cars over trains post-WWII, which is why I use one.

6183968,comment,6182265,6182733,1,0,cLeEOGPw,,,"1. A system, almost the same as it is now, but the one patenting has to prove the patent office that the thing he wants to patent cannot be easily reproduced elsewhere without specific prerequisites, like exactly the types of research that was done by the patent &quot;client&quot;. This rule would protect patent for things like drugs, where it is very expensive to find and test formula, but easy to copy, but would make it impossible to patent things like rounded corners or trivial algorithms or methods, things that are used the most by patent trolls.<p>2. Let everyone make anything that is patented, doesn&#x27;t matter who is holding the patent, but the one using the patents should be aware he is using it. Then, if he, who used the patent, makes no money from it&#x27;s use, he is allowed to use it without any limits (for example personal use, experiments, etc). If the patent user starts to make profit out of the product, which uses the patent, then there would be a special patent evaluation group, that would evaluate the significance of the patented thing, and the evaluated significance, combined with the profit the project is making and the set fraction that the patent holder gets, will be issued as a non-debatable compensation. Also the patent would only start to cost from a certain amount of profit bar and the price would rise non-linearly as the profit improves, so that lower profit products have to pay less, so that the price would not impede the growth, but only promote innovation by paying for it. The weak link would be the evaluation group - how to ensure it is not corrupt and evaluates righteously? Strict rules for evaluation could be set, but that would require some work to set up.<p>3. Combine those two.",1376027782

6183948,comment,6160337,6161130,1,0,johnathanz,,,"The misconception about what a &#x27;founder&#x27; represents is so true.  I&#x27;ve been guilty of it myself till I spotted the danger signs (delegating too much, modelling myself after Steve Jobs with the misconception that all I have to do is have &#x27;vision&#x27; :P).<p>The reality is as a startup founder, you&#x27;re expected to bear the blunt of the risk as well as majority of the tasks, from getting coffees, to setting &#x27;vision&#x27;, to product design, and coding the mundane that others don&#x27;t want to do.<p>To this day, I still firmly believe that (on my 1st startup, so additional mileage may change that) having a diverse skillset, or the uncompromising willingness to learn anything is key to success - guess that&#x27;s what PG calls determination.<p>So going back to the OP&#x27;s view that solo founding is possible - I totally agree.  You may need to hire or get help where your tech / business skills are lacking.  But if you have sufficient & diverse work experience, and some financial capital, it&#x27;s totally feasible to go solo.<p>A big BUT is the emotional support that a team can offer.  This is even more so when you have a solid co-founder.  The trials of startups are hard and deeply emotional (I think all founders will naturally develop bi-polar disorder - one day you feel on top of the world with your world changing idea, the next you are filled with doubt), so any kind of support from people that understand what you&#x27;re going through helps - this is unlikely to be your spouse if they&#x27;ve never been exposed to startups or even the financial burdens of brick-n-mortar business.  You can substitute with meetups and surround yourself with startup founders, but someone who doesn&#x27;t have skin in the game just isn&#x27;t the same.<p>TL;DR So while I think it&#x27;s possible to do it alone, there are added benefits to being able to share the responsibility & emotional rollercoaster of a startup\nI also recommend everyone read &#x27;Founder&#x27;s Dilemma&#x27;, good data backed analysis of pros & cons of various startup decisions like solo vs. co-founding.  Bootstrapping vs. funding, etc.",1376027250

I saw the movie last week in Japan, and it was alright, but not extremely good either (But since I hated the stupid &quot;Ponyo&quot; movie, it could only be better than the previous one...).<p>It&#x27;s very difficult to make a movie about an engineer who does not fly himself (and therefore where there is not much action involved). Conveying his process of thought was near impossible and most of the time you end up seeing him scratching stuff on paper in the movie, or making paper airplanes. Mmm. This could have been better.<p>The love story felt very pointless (and almost fake), compared to his other movies as well. And since the movie was set in a realistic setting, there was not much of the imaginative fantasy that I like from his previous works.<p>I liked some other aspects, like how he refers to the cultural exchanges between Germany and Japan before the War, and how Japan felt that they were clearly behind in terms of technology vs Junker. That was insightful and well done.<p>All in all, an OK movie. I won&#x27;t go and watch it a second time, however, I don&#x27;t think it deserves a second viewing. Unlike most of his other movies that I watch from time to time.<p>Funny trivia, that you may have heard of: the director of Evangelion (Anno Hideki) was chosen to dub the hero&#x27;s voice in &#x27;Kaze Tachinu&#x27;.

But I&#x27;m very conscious of the fact that almost all the tools I use every day -- Linux, tmux, vim, Ruby, Python, etc, not to mention hundreds of libraries and plugins -- were all developed by people in the open source community. Often these people were working for free or for far below-market wages. Whether or not OP likes the OSS movement, modern software development is built on open source tools.

It&#x27;s way better than nothing - you get to see the developer&#x27;s coding style, commenting approach and overall code organization. You say it&#x27;s not your best work? then put something you&#x27;re proud of on there before you send your resume. If you don&#x27;t have one project that you think is representative of your current skill, you have to understand that is problematic for potential employers. Don&#x27;t want to share it on GitHub? that&#x27;s fine, send code examples instead of a GitHub link. But you can&#x27;t hire a developer without reviewing some of his/her code first.<p>Personally, I find a Stack Overflow profile to be the best indicator of a developers skill, if he has a somewhat active profile (over 2-3k points). Being able to explain technical solutions, I think, is the best way to see if someone is both capable and can work in a team<p>Regarding resumes - another touchy matter. When I freelanced I haven&#x27;t sent a resume as such as I had a portfolio site, but now that I&#x27;m on the other side of the table, going over resumes - most of them are completely terrible. Some people are completely clueless on what to put on a resume and others try to game it - putting stuff like &quot;raised x metric by y% on project z&quot; - giving me zero clue to what they actually did there. It&#x27;s very rare I can get an actual glimpse to what the person was doing at his previous work. That&#x27;s why you&#x27;ll need to tell them your story when you interview... it&#x27;s too easy to assume the interviewer was just lazy going over your resume because you think you &quot;nailed&quot; it, but in truth your resume probably sucks as an indicator of your actual experience and ability.",1376024941

You only must identify yourself (this does not mean you have to carry ID) if you are under a Terry stop and are in a state which has specifically enacted legislation requiring identification during a Terry stop. A Terry stop requires reasonable suspicion a crime has been committed. This is why I specifically and carefully said &quot;you are not required to identify yourself to any police officer just because he asks, and if he asks without reasonable suspicion or probable cause (it depends on the state which one is the threshold), and you refuse to state your name, then he can not arrest you for that sole reason.&quot; In states with stop and identify laws that allow for it, he can require you identify yourself given reasonable suspicion of a crime.

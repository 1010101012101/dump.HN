4541638,comment,4541519,4541519,2,0,shenberg,,,"decimal fractions can't necessarily be represented by a finite amount of bits (just like the fraction 1/3 is 0.333333...). Computers work with finite amounts of bits, so you're losing some accuracy. Other representation methods could be used to store the numbers (e.g. store the nominator and denominator as whole numbers), but you can't get around the fact that an infinite amount of numbers can't be represented with a finite amount of bits (e.g. the square root of two can't be represented accurately as a ratio).",1348019956
4541637,comment,4539284,4540640,4,0,buddydvd,,,"Okay, I was able to confirm sergeo's statement. Here's what I did:<p>1.) I compiled my app with a 4-inch default image using XCode 4.4.1 with iOS 5.1 as the base SDK and ran the app in Xcode 4.4.1's iOS simulator.<p>2.) I copied the resulting i386 app folder from /Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/5.1/Applications/[app uuid] to /Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/6.0/Applications/<p>3.) I started XCode 4.5's iOS Simulator and ran my app from Spring Board.<p>The result? It did work. I was able to see my Xcode 4.4.1-compiled app in 4-inch display mode.<p>I can't say for sure if this will work on the iPhone 5 hardware, but I'd bet the answer is yes.<p>I guess with this finding, if you're not using any iOS 6.0 features, it may be better to continue to compile your app using Xcode 4.4.1 since that lets you more easily produce app with armv6 support.",1348019955

The home button complements the back button to give you two options: stay in the app or go back to where ever you came from.<p>I think the more real problem is that developers have been really bad at choosing the right default behavior for things like launching from notifications, widgets, or intents. These things are often the most likely way someone will interact with your app, so implementing them needs careful attention. At a minimum, an app like Gmail should offer a configuration to change the behavior even if they want to choose a weird default that overrides standard system behavior.",1348019842

Nobody argues that the man with the Audi has the better car, but one might infer that he also has more disposable income. That is why we assume people with Macbooks have more disposable income; they've purchased a luxury item when there is a commodity alternative. A backlit keyboard is definitely not required to use a laptop, no more than heated seats are necessary in a car. You think they're essential because you have enough disposable income that the utility of the money you'd use to buy the keyboard has become less than the utility of the keyboard.

Now I know the word is relative but I have used both android and iPhone in the past and I just love how the Windows phone brings everything together and how it is consistent across the board.<p>It has this app integration where you can link into an app from another. e.g. if I looked up a restaurant in maps then all the restaurant related apps such as yelp and opentable are available to me right there.

4541601,comment,4537834,4537834,3,0,ALee,,,"Here is my list of ideas:<p>1. Problem: Difficult to implement shipping for any business, website, store, etc. You only have UPS/FedEx<p><pre><code>   Solution: Kayak for Shipping - Developer implements shipping API, which enables back end to do a rate shopping engine for shipping, which taps into APIs for FedEx, USPS, UPS, and allows local shippers to qualify for the program, including PostMates and any other Joe Schmo interested in shipping...
</code></pre>
2. Problem: I can't play paintball with my friends.
   Solution: Ender's Game - Computers v. Humans<p>3. Problem: People die because they can't get organ donations.
   Solution: Create a co-op where people join a market for organ donations.<p>4. Problem: Scheduling things with friends is really hard, there is too much back and forth over SMS and email
   Solution: Set up a centralized service through your phone that schedules for you, but is totally automated, no human beings, just machines, so that virtual assistants don't have to waste time scheduling<p>5. Problem: There are no parking spots in the city
   Solution: Price out illegal parking zones by multiplying the probability of ticket * ticket cost. Using a mobile app, a user pays for parking insurance at differing rates, but allows them to find a parking spot where there previously wasn't one<p>6. Problem: why is it that you can only bookmark pages or urls
   Solution: delicious 2.0 - be able to micro-bookmark.  i should be able to save things at the sub page level and consume that content later: a post in a block, a newsfeed post on facebook, a photo in a webpage, a section of an article. etc<p>7. Problem: Sending direct mail is hard - you need good lists, need to process with mailhouses, and you don't know whether the mail you send is reaching the right audience
   Solution: Create a digital application to send mail as easily as email, complete with analytics of the funnel, and the ability to unsubscribe from the mail you're sent. Make mail, like e-mail.<p>8.  Problem: Animated GIFs are the new LolCat, where can I find the best animated GIFs?
    Solution: Use animated gifs as a medium for snipping video that you can easily see over your mobile phone<p>9.  Problem: What happens to all my digital stuff when I die? Or when I want something killed...
    Solution: future me, death switch - go through with my credentials and find usernames and passwords and have ways to kill the accounts.<p>10.  Problem: I can't listen to radio broadcasts, etc. with my friends
   Solution: Social listening with friends. Suggestions from friends of articles or things to listen to with their commentary in their words.<p>11. Problem: Mobile data sucks sucks sucks. I want to watch something on demand or download a movie.
   Solution: BitTorrent for mobile. Allow the sharing of mobile data amongst subscribers, but you have leech and seed at the same time...<p>12. Problem: Keeping in touch with people is REALLY hard.
    Solution: Create retention method of keeping in touch with people that uses a computer to help you keep in touch with people who matter.<p>13.  Problem: Buying billboard ads sucks
     Solution: Create billboard ad marketplace<p>13. Problem: Retail locations have captive audiences and it's hard enough to monetize the location. Why doesn't everything turn into a Times Square?
    Solution: Give them a TV, stream over the internet, and do ads. You can break up with television advertising model by guaranteeing the location and zip code.<p>14.  Problem: Shipping takes time.
     Solution: Establish network of 3D printers to print things on demand for same-day shipping.<p>15.  Problem: People get stabbed in the Mission
     Solution: 1) Crowd-sourcing police cameras, we pay people to stream live their local areas and videotape people walking around. Instead of just letting police see it, everyone sees what's going on, but the difference is that the owner and we hold the rights to the content. Assumption that more cameras means less stabbings. 2) You could even SMS a number and it would follow your location on your way home so that you are recorded every step of the way. Kind of like a virtual sentry and you could have an individual nearby to escort you if need be for a digital amount. 3) Text Message app where if a crime has been committed. It texts me that one has happened near me. Uses increasingly open government data apis and police blotters.<p>16.  Problem: Where are all the hot people? How can we take the local tracking phenomenon to an even deeper degree...
     Solution: Hot or Not of Local. People take pics of other folks and they can rate those people relatively around them.<p>17. Problem: I can't have dinner with my family in Colorado, HK, etc.
   Solution: Hack the Kinect to create the Farenheit 451 wall. We can actually have real conversations with people. I somehow feel MSFT will do this with Skype and Kinect, but whatevz.<p>18.  Problem: Receipts suck. Yet, we still need them.
     Solution: Make it easy to create a hardware or software solution that takes receipts and mails them in a way that is easy for Quickbooks, quicken, or whoever needs to keep track of expenses. I hate Oracle.<p>19.  Problem: I want to watch movies with friends.
     Solution: Have a way to watch a movie with a friend and have them put commentary on the movie and for me to also enjoy watching the movie. Annotations and real social. Spotify meets Netflix.<p>20.  Problem: Water is expensive for large utilities.
     Solution: Smart grid for water utilities: OPower, but for water utilities. The issue here is that water is cheap, but a very large industry, so where could I make the delivery of water much more efficient.<p>21.  Problem: I hate buying new computer equipment
     Solution: Lease electronic equipment - Apple products are uniquely suited to this. New ones are released every 12 months, old ones have a high resale value, iCloud syncs all your documents for when you buy a new device, and there's a large population of people who always want to own the latest one. You could charge a flat monthly rate to people who always want to have the newest iPad, then send them a new one every 12 months with a prepaid box to return their old one. There's even a 3rd party warranty company that covers drops and spills for a reasonable rate -- <a href=""http://www.squaretrade.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.squaretrade.com</a>.<p>22. Problem: Payroll is DOMINATED by two guys - ADP and PayChex, they suck
    Solution: Kill them. Do better with a product that values people as people.<p>23.  Problem: [w] why can't you buy something online and pick it up in a store (this currently is verticalized)
     Solution: make product search -> purchase and pickup in store easy.  build the amazon for local pickup<p>24.  Problem: AirTime sucked because it didn't let you Hot or Not people
     Solution: It would be awesome if you could... AirTime with HotOrNot... social and virtual currency. Allowing pretty people to make money from their beauty.",1348019091

You can't look at the European system without understanding that a lawsuit means a lot more in Europe than it does here. Many of the things that Europe does through administrative processes, the US does through litigation. It's easy to fixate on the costs of litigation, but realize that other systems don't necessarily eliminate those costs, but move them around by organizing things differently.<p>If a suit is truly meritless, it will be dismissed very early in the litigation process (summary judgment) before costs have piled up. The American legal system tries very hard to be ""lazy"" (in the CS sense), backloading costs as much as possible. Yes, it can cost millions of dollars to defend a suit at trial, but if a suit has made it that far it means that it was not a meritless suit. Why should the loser pay if he brings a meritorious case in good faith? Remember, in the US a lawsuit is usually the process through which the facts underlying a dispute are discovered. It often happens that someone legitimately thinks he has been wronged, but the process of litigation uncovers facts that show otherwise.<p>Loser pays systems chill litigation against big corporations. People focus on the situations in which they perceive there to be too much litigation, but in many areas there is not enough litigation. Litigation is the process through which citizens force corporations to fix unsafe products or clean up polluted land and water. Individuals are already at a huge disadvantage in these situations, and the threat of a corporation running up the bill in a loser pays system would do great injustice. Europe gets away with it because it has far more active government oversight and prosecution of such things.",1348018791

It has always been great for navigating between apps even though it is a bit confusing. Adding a _second_ back button (a third if you count the home button as a long jump back) was the worst decision the android team ever made.<p>I mean, I understand where they were coming from. When a user jumps between apps he or she might want to be able to navigate inside the apps not just between the apps. However, a single back button with an already too flexible implementation was confusing enough that adding even more navigation options was a terrible decision. One back button forced apps builders to make their app usable within a single thread of history which is a Good Thing.<p>When a user jumps from app to app and suddenly decides she doesn't want to follow the current line of history, it is not unreasonable, and much less confusing, to make her go through the device home screen to get access to the start screen of the app and its full navigation tree.<p>When an app opens another app it should be only to give access to a particular section of the second app that is relevant to the first app.<p>A single back button also helped with the recent apps list mismatches.

4541507,comment,4540742,4540742,19,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I think the most common argument I hear against IP protections for software is that so much of it is obvious, or incremental. We have companies patenting and suing over techniques which are considered common knowledge by many programmers. How silly was it that Oracle's recent huge lawsuit ended up hinging on a range check function?<p>But is that the same as a masterful magic trick? And if not, should we treat it the same?<p>I don't think it's the same thing at all. A master magician might easily spend years practicing a trick -- the right mechanics, the right theatricality, anticipating the audience response, coming up with some new illusion -- and then, as the article describes, if that trick is self-contained enough, someone else might see it and work out how it's done and then sell the same trick to people who haven't invested anywhere near as much effort in practicing it.<p>So I don't think that we can say, well, this is just like software, it's an idea, and therefore we shouldn't protect it. I think that the very idea behind IP laws in the first place was to protect <i>effort</i> -- to safeguard someone's livelihood if they spent years developing an idea, so that someone else wouldn't simply come along immediately afterward and usurp the idea and rob that person of all of the effort that they invested in developing it.<p>There's this huge difference in effort between writing simple functions in software and developing masterful magic tricks, and we should recognize that.<p>Nor do I think that Penn & Teller are at all guilty of hypocrisy. I think it's enough to have just seen some episodes of <i>Fool Us</i> to see that they can have huge amounts of respect for magicians who copy their tricks, <i>so long as those magicians add something unique to it</i>. That's all they ask: take what we do, and do it better.<p>I can not imagine defending the reverse engineering and subsequent sale of someone else's unique illusion under the umbrella that ""software patents are bad"".<p>I am somewhat more dismayed that the article seemed to present a good enough case for this all on its own, but the discussion so far is ignoring it -- almost as if everyone just skimmed it.",1348017088

Quickly going through an entire app (which is what I'd expect a reviewer [who's actually testing the app] to do) is necessarily going to involve lots of really quick pushes and pops of VCs and swipes and whatnot. So no, I don't think the reviewer was trying to find some pretext to reject you. That doesn't even make sense. Why would a reviewer need that?",1348016708

They're trying to use an adaptive algorithm to resize text intelligently, making ""content"" appear larger than nav bars and the like.<p>At least with Firefox, this fails when someone leaves a short comment and the algorithm doesn't recognise it as content.  Even if Chrome fails in a different way, they're failing at the same (somewhat hard) problem.<p>Maybe it could fixed by, upon discovering content, ensuring that any similarly styled/classed elements had the same font size?",1348016644

4541465,comment,4540776,4540776,41,0,notJim,,,"I have both a ""new iPad"" and an Android Phone (an HTC G2, which is stuck in Gingerbread and is not exactly in its prime.) I am a fairly simple user of both of these: I use a few apps (Twitter and Yelp come to mind, and an app to read reddit) and the stock apps (Google Maps especially on the phone, the browser on both.) Here is my perspective on the two: it doesn't actually matter that much.<p>With iOS, everything looks pretty good and there's a lot of consistency. The browser, I understand, is much better than the browser on my phone (I'm not sure how it stacks up against Chrome for Android, which is not available to me.) But then, iOS is kind of annoying too: the keyboard placement often gets in the way of text fields, there is zero integration in between apps and no way for an app to provide a common service, I have to log in to everything separately. It's very difficult to move within a word (for example, if I typed fold instead of food, it is difficult to change the l to an o.) Every app has its own embedded web browser, which invariably has slight different controls than every other apps embedded web browser. Settings are sometimes bafflingly hidden in some other settings app, rather than being in the actual app you're using. Those things annoy me slightly, but they don't bother me that much when I'm using the device, because when I'm using the device, I'm focused on the task at hand and the device doesn't confuse me enough that it breaks my concentration. This is easy to understand because, as I mentioned, I do pretty simple things on my iPad.<p>With Android, apps can provide common services (""Android intents"") and they integrate well with one another. There's a back button to move between apps, so apps don't need to do things like embed their own web browser. There's a little nub that I can use to move within a word, so correcting text is much easier. I can use a custom keyboard that is better than both the iOS keyboard (which is admittedly very good), and better than the built-in Android keyboard (which is pretty good, but doesn't have very good autocorrect.) But the thing with Android is that up until recently, it's been very plain and even ugly by default. The default look of an app is pretty ugly (just white text on a black background) so developers seem to try to implement their own style, with varying degrees of success. When the back button works, it's a godsend, but when it doesn't it's really fucking confusing. Animations are often choppy. But mostly none of this actually matters that much, because when I'm using the device, I'm focused on the task at hand and the device doesn't confuse me enough that it breaks my concentration. This is easy to understand because, as I mentioned, I do pretty simple things on my Android device.",1348016431

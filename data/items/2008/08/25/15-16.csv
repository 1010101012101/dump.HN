Obviously we're doing some things wrong and I'm wondering if there are any trusted consultants or organizations that are available for hire to take a look at what we've got and try to make the best of it.<p>Other than manually tweaking and tuning the site to generate maximum revenue & trying out the different ad networks, etc. is there any outsourcing approach that fellow hackers would recommend? Ideally, we'd just hire a company to take a look at our site, optimize ad layouts for us, recommend the right ad networks by visitor demographics, and generally improve our visitor-to-cash ratio to help us keep afloat.<p>Any suggestions?",1219679725

Forcing newcomers to present on the first night does enable you to know straight away if someone is for real, or just a poser.<p>On the downside, you run the risk of having a lot of very simple stuff being presented over and over again, because newcomers don't know that red over there in the corner presented pretty much the same thing last month...<p>Finally, the success or otherwise is going to very heavily depend on just how alpha-geek the environment is.  If you have too many people trying to exclude newcomers because they consider the newcomer to not be up to their very high standards, it'd quickly devolve into a... less than interesting group to participate in.",1219679318

If it does, there is a lot of interesting advice that people need: laws, children, compensations...<p>In general I find very important the evaluation of the partner's personality. There are traits that help detect annoying behaviours or even personality disorders, that are more easily identifiable ""remotely"" through a written report than in the flesh by the blinded-by-love partner.<p>The site not only can help detecting the abuse, but also help making a decision and running for the hills :-)<p>I would suggest: 1) bootstrapping the site with the help of professional psychologists (and if divorce is included, lawyers) to ""set the right tone"" and 2) putting some machinery in place to prevent bitter people that always give the destructive advice. A bad behaviour in a partner could be solved with a frank conversation. No one is perfect.<p>I find the looks of the site a little too ""packed"".

When they find you, start working on that problem, till then, handle your more pressing problem of gaining users.<p>If you go to Yahoo Answers and point to a relevant link on your own site to the question being asked, I think this qualifies as marketing, no longer spam.<p>In any case, realise this:<p>The users of fluther and Yahoo Answers are your CORE audience. You may also take a look at the ask.metafilter.com users - if you sign up for a $5 account, you can post a link to your site under the ""Projects"" section. You'll get about 200-400 hits, but it's a relevant audience.<p>Otherwise, you'll have to use a gimmick. This is not ethical, but if you are interested in relevant traffic, then do this:<p>Post a troll. Target this troll towards christian fundamentalists, teenage girls, or housewives. Then visit a site where these groups are, like a christian forum, a youtube posting of Avril Lavigne or an advice site like flylady. Link to this troll of yours, and watch them get in a hullaboo about it and create links everywhere.<p>For example, you could write:<p>""My girlfriend just admitted to me that when Snoop Dogg was in town, she slept with one of his bodyguards. Should I break up with her?""<p>""My wife has herpes, and our gardener also has herpes. Is she cheating?""<p>""My sons girlfriend is 14 and he is 18. Is this legal?""<p>That's linkbait, but you need to target it correctly.

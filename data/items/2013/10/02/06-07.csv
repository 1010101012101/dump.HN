6481085,comment,6478943,6478943,1,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"AGI is a very <i>weird</i> field, in that approximately half the practitioners are getting experimental results, half are getting formal mathematical results, and half are complete crackpots outside their own field of Narrow AI expertise.  These attributes can even appear in <i>the same person</i>, though Ray Kurzweil and Google are famous for seeming more crackpot-y than many for essentially claiming that a sufficiently large deep-learning or neural-network algorithm will at some point develop sapience ;-).<p>Which is obviously wrong.  Everyone knows it will develop sapience <i>and then develop a fetish for small office implements and destroy humanity.</i><p>Ok, to be serious, the guys who are actually doing Real Research into this sort of thing are, IMHO, Juergen Schmidhuber and Marcus Hutter.  They are getting formal results in what they call the &quot;new formal science&quot; of &quot;Universal Artificial Intelligence&quot;, and their insights into UAI are then leading them back to insights into Narrow AI and Machine Learning.  Notice how they keep producing publications in reputable journals, keep getting awards for their papers, and keep getting major research grants?  That&#x27;s called <i>results</i>, and it&#x27;s what shows they&#x27;re onto something.<p>They actually wrote a textbook on the subject, but it is, unfortunately, well beyond my level of background knowledge right now.  I would recommend it, however, to anyone who thinks that AGI is going to be as cheap and easy as throwing lots and lots of machines into a single gigantic machine-learning cluster.<p>On the upside, their algorithms can play a game of Pac-Man.  Someone ought to enter them in a Procedural Super Mario competition.  But overall, the old dream of &quot;Strong AI&quot; is not a matter of just coming up with the One True Algorithm and crossing the finishing line to victory.  Even for the researchers smart enough to see the eventual shape of the finished product, there are lots of intermediate steps still to be solved -- even though we now have a better idea of what they are than before.",1380697062

It seems that this kind of thing persists into adulthood, because I notice that it is hard to experience and analyze at the same time. For example, it is hard to read a book to experience the story and analyze the narrative structure at the same time.

But the correct conclusion from what you said is that you demonstrated that it&#x27;s a lot more complex than just the environmental factors that you thought of.<p>You seem to be concluding genetic factors (&quot;always had an intrinsic motivation&quot;). But &quot;not all environment&quot; does not imply &quot;some genetics&quot;, that is a false alternative.<p>There are more possible factors than just environment and genetics. One is human choice (sometimes called &quot;free will&quot;, but that term has a lot of baggage). I do not agree with the perspective of attributing everything to factors, rather than a person&#x27;s own choices.<p>Genetics certainly have a role in some sense. If you had different genes, you would have been a cat instead of human, and would not have the brain to be a software engineer.<p>But the general idea that life is very complicated, and the results of people in similar situations vary -- true so far -- simply does not imply (partial) genetic determinism. &quot;Environment&quot;, or more generally alternatives to genetic determinism, is/are very subtle and complex. The world is vastly complicated, &quot;environment&quot; refers to a million factors most of which no one documents.<p>You had, in many respects, a different life and environment than anyone else had. Everyone has a unique environment at high precision. So whatever result you get, what would that prove?<p>You wonder how a person with several factors against them could be intelligent and successful? You can&#x27;t think of any ways, besides genetics? There are a million ways. Poverty, non-wonderful discouraging parents, poor teachers, and whatever else are not one&#x27;s whole life. You met many people, some more helpful than that. You read some books. Even just an ordered list of what books you read up to age 20 might be unique.<p>People don&#x27;t start the same, but even if they did, things would quickly branch, again and again. 30 identical students sit in a classroom. The teacher explains something. By sheer randomness, if nothing else, some students understand it today, and some do not understand it yet. Then the next day the teacher gives a second lecture. Everyone hears &quot;the same&quot; lecture, but they have different situations (having understood or not understood yesterday&#x27;s lesson), so different students experience &quot;the same lecture&quot; in different ways due to their different situations and perspectives. Similarly, in general, people in &quot;the same environment&quot; are not actually having the same experiences.",1380696427

This means you will be writing a lot more boilerplate code.\nMeteor has some memory issues as well at times. You have to be aware of memory leaks and will frequent the profiler often, especially with large client-side applications. I&#x27;ve had some projects that I&#x27;ve worked on in Meteor hit 1GB of RAM client-side. Recent releases have been working on this, though.  \nLive reload and hot code pushes are kind of a moot point with something like the Live Reload plugin for Sublime Text or equivalent.<p>For realtime applications, Meteor is a whole different beast. Realtime applications are much easier to code. I&#x27;m comparing this to making a realtime Node.js application. Meteor takes care of the boilerplate for you, pushing changes automatically to the client. It&#x27;s not difficult to do something like socket.io and node.js but it is nice to have that all handled for you.<p>It&#x27;s great for getting an application off the floor - it has a lot of that magic RoR had when it was released. Once applications get more advanced, the structure and maturity of RoR make it easier to work with. These issues are things Meteor is working on, especially in terms of stabilizing the spec/API and working on fixing the edge cases. With 1.0, it seems they are bringing some more stability to it by making it production ready. Its strengths are much more apparent in realtime applications as compared to a traditional web framework.<p>Edit: As compared to other node.js frameworks like Express, Meteor is much easier to work with - I probably would not go back to raw Express after Meteor. It&#x27;s been moving fast to 1.0 where many of the issues I&#x27;ve had with it should be resolved with stability and as edge cases are resolved.",1380695521

Given the period was one of dramatic economic and social change I doubt most Kiwis could give you a remotely impartial account (myself included); a couple of key elements that appear to be completely absent in the US culture are:<p>1/ A willingness to accept loophole losses.

I certainly can&#x27;t claim deductions for &quot;having a mortgage&quot;, for example.

Mainstream political dialogue tends to be around fixing perceived problems in government, not nuking it to a smoking hole, pissing in the hole, and sowing the ground with salt.<p>Many US progressives/lefties I&#x27;ve spoken with seem to react with suspicion and horror at the idea of being able to have the IRS estimate your taxes on your behalf  in case they swindle them out of their tax breaks, which is both a nice combination of 1) and 3), and illustrates the gulf operating.

That objectively seems not to be the case. First, the measurement outcome of the study was language use. They didn&#x27;t attempt to measure IQ or <i>g</i> except when the children were 3. As far as I can tell from references, without access to the primary source, they did not perform any IQ tests on the children at later dates. I verified this with google searches within the book which only returned mentions of a test given at age three, but this is not iron-clad given google books&#x27; search mechanism. As far as I can tell, any claims that IQ was shown to be increased by the intervention are based on the very high correlation found between IQ and vocabulary at that age three test. Second, they only evaluated children (for language use) until the age of 9-10, which would be broadly consistent with the consensus understanding of psychometricians, which is that the heritability of IQ increases throughout childhood (implying in simplified language that non-heritable environmental factors have lesser correlation with IQ at adulthood, even if they have a greater impact during childhood).<p>The study wasn&#x27;t designed to measure the impact of genetics on <i>g</i>, so we shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that it fails to measure it. It was designed to measure the impact of in-home language use on vocabulary acquisition, which it clearly does well.

They need one license for their entire site.<p>> GitHub sells GitHub Enterprise to various customers. They need one license per customer because the product is installed and run locally by the customer.<p>> Pivotal Labs builds websites on behalf of customers.

Thus you cannot scientifically study color at all--if you try, what you are actually studying is human perception and language.<p>This is not an unscientific concept, because human perception and language are naturally occurring, albeit incredibly complex, phenomena.<p>Animals do not see colors, they react to physical phenomena including photons. Humans use the concept of color to describe what animals do.<p>Certain animals who learn human language can communicate with us about color. That doesn&#x27;t mean they can&#x27;t think, it just means that color is a human construct so they need human language to reason about it.<p>[1] What physically exists are photons across a range of frequencies, but that&#x27;s not the same thing as color.",1380693685

In fact, it was Lisp all the way down to the microcode, or at least, it would present the microcode in Emacs as if it were Lisp, and you could modify it there. The Lisp machine OS was similar to other OSes of the age, more capable in many ways.<p>On the other hand, IIRC early machines at least used custom hardware with direct support for many runtime features and implementation details, e.g. GC and tagged pointers.",1380693679

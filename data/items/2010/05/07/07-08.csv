I realize that this borders on fortune-telling, but you seem to have a decent grasp on the situation, and you say RE: bailing out Greece that ""it really is damned if you do, damned if you don't"", so I'd like to ask -- in your personal opinion, what impact do you see this (the impending collapse of the Euro) having internationally over the coming decade?<p>In other words, is this necessarily the beginning of a chain reaction, or is there, in your opinion, some route by which the effects of Greece's economic death rattle may be confined locally?<p>Also, can anyone elaborate on ""they all share a promise that no one will let any fail""? Does this 'promise' have a strong legal basis, or is that simply an implied economic obligation in the face of mutually-assured destruction (i.e., as per the California comparison, is leaving Greece out in the cold even an option, legally?)",1273219149

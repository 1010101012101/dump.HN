102874,comment,102452,102808,0,0,mixmax,,,"I think that line of thought is on the right track. The reason money hold value is that they are a scarce resource. Some can have more than others, but only if they have earned it. Thus users with more ""money in the bank"" can have a stronger say. (note similarity with real world ;-))<p>The major problem with modding systems as they are today (in my humble opinion, that is) is that there are no scarcity. We all have all the money in the world, so to speak.<p>What this means is that we don't save our mod points, submissions or whatever because there is no cost in losing them. We can give away money and still have an unlimited amount. And we all have equal amounts.<p>We need to go from socialist to a capitalist modding systems :-)",1201109644

102859,comment,102452,102780,0,0,apgwoz,,,"But, you're changing the way that the site _can_ be used. Not saying the that recommendation engine works well, but it won't work at all if I can't rate things because I have no karma left. It also won't help me, if I use reddit in place of sites like del.icio.us or other social bookmarking sites.<p>Personally, I think the private subreddit thing is going to be a huge win, because it now becomes a better del.icio.us. In del.icio.us you can share links, but you can't easily discuss things about them. Now, in order for this to be really good, reddit will have to provide a ""copy this to my private subreddit"" and make it more blatantly apparent that you can actually become ""friends"" with others. It wouldn't hurt reddit if they made it super super easy to add and update the people allowed in the subreddit (I'm thinking API even).",1201107755

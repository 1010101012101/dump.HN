It is quite understandable that FB has a leaning for the young as much of FB feeds off of young folks. I canât imagine too many 50+ guys brainstorming next generation of FB features. At the same time I canât imagine too many grades in early 20s coming up with next set of Lotus features.<p>May be the whole thing was missing a big disclaimer: USE WHAT WORKS BEST FOR YOU:)<p>-Zaid\n",1174848903
6165,comment,6148,6148,0,0,danielha,,,"I knew Mark's would be drawing some fast criticism. There were some things he said that raised my eyebrows, sure. Super arrogant, absolutely. I sure as hell got something out of it though. He just gets what he's doing. He sees how critical it is to keep technical people behind the company. And while his blanket statement about youthfulness made some eyes roll, it holds true for most of us and especially facebook. No matter what you might think of the guy, it'd be a really good idea to buy facebook stock when they eventually go public.",1174848843

As a matter of fact, there are videos of _everything_, including random lunch conversations, given that justin.tv was there. This video was taken on my digital camera, hence the crappy quality. The useful part is the audio. ",1174847636
6161,comment,6148,6148,0,0,jamiequint,,,"I think what Mark is trying to avoid is the ""Curse of Knowledge"" (To borrow the Heath brothers phrase - check out Made to Stick, great book) Facebook is all about innovation, I think they purposefully avoid old ideas. (preferring young people = fresh ideas) Thats not to say they aren't young experienced smart people.",1174847214
6160,comment,6134,6140,0,0,davidw,,,"""what is driving people into the service of others is a combination of ...""<p>Capital has historically been a big factor in that equation as well.  A factory worker couldn't very well take his machine around to different factories, whereas a mechanic probably has his own set of tools.  Those of us in the computer field are fortunate that, at this point in time, capital requirements are very, very low.  In other fields, though, large amounts of money are needed to be able to get off the ground.  Who knows what the future will bring... less capital needs or more?<p>Incidentally, as much as I would have liked to see it, I couldn't take watching a bouncy image of some guy's ear next to a tiny Paul Graham.  It would be great if they provided video of the whole thing for those of us not able to be there.",1174846430

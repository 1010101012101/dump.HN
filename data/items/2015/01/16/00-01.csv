It refers to lower wages, which might be one.<p>This just reminds me of other gov&#x27;t efforts to &quot;tweak&quot; the system.  A great example in the US is drug prices.  Some federal gov&#x27;t programs (Medicare) get to buy drugs at either  discount X% or <i>the lowest price offered (to non-gov&#x27;t customers)</i> whichever is lower.<p>Sounds like a great idea, but what drug companies started to do is <i>pull back</i> their discounts on private customers in order to minimize the discount to the gov&#x27;t.  As the gov&#x27;t started paying more, a mish-mash of &quot;tweaks&quot; were made to avoid this.  This just created new ways for drug companies to respond.<p>Basic income is a decent idea at first glance, but holy crap it could become a complex mess pretty quick if it&#x27;s not done right.

I also benefitted from Pell grants and a first time home buyer grant with my girlfriend.<p>I think public venture funding is compelling and could lead us in all kinds of new directions because funds would be more easily obtained for the public good than sole profitability.  I&#x27;d even go as far as to say that the reason so many ventures have a vacuous (if not suspect) goal is that currently we are in an era where most of the world&#x27;s liquid wealth is held by private institutions rather than the people or the commons.  For example I don’t see something like the moon landing happening today, or even large public works like Hoover dam (whose cost/benefit analysis can be left to a later discussion).",1421369797

8896532,comment,8896186,8896186,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"This seems like yet another good example of why robust application-level access control would be a helpful thing to build into modern operating systems, in addition to the typical user-based controls. This may have been both a rookie mistake and a regrettable failure of code review processes, but in any case it simply shouldn’t be possible for an application running on a modern system to wipe out all user data without warning in such a sweeping way.<p>I have often made this argument in the context of sandboxing communications software like browsers and e-mail clients, where it is relatively unusual to need access to local files except for their own data. In that context, restricting access to other parts of the filesystem unless explicitly approved would be a useful defence against security vulnerabilities being exploited by data from remote sources. It’s hard to encrypt someone’s data and hold it for ransom or to upload sensitive documents if your malware-infected process gets killed the moment it starts poking around where it has no business being.<p>More generally, I see no reason that we shouldn’t limit applications’ access to any system by default, following the basic security principle of least privilege. We have useful access control lists based on concepts of ownership by users and groups and reserving different parts of the filesystem for different people. Why can’t we also have something analogous where different files or other system resources are only accessible to applications that have been approved for that access?",1421368991

That is, there is much MORE involved in a jobs guarantee: you have to actually come up with all those jobs.  And you have to provide managers for them.  And this whole system of employing people -- and you could pretty easily screw all that up.<p>One kind of exciting thing that might happen in a GBI system is that maybe someone who right now can&#x27;t get a job because, for example, he lacks skills or has a dubious past, could get a job paying something really, really low ($1 per hour, maybe), but it&#x27;s all on top of his GBI, so he&#x27;s marginally better off, and he could either prove that he was all along actually valuable, or learn things that make him a valuable worker, and then start up the income ladder.<p>That seems much harder in a guaranteed job system.  I mean, you could imagine how it might work in a guaranteed job system, where the guaranteed job does teach/prove generally useful skills, and where the guaranteed job is managed competently enough that private employers trust that people who have good performance ratings at the guaranteed job (or whatever) genuinely are good workers, but it&#x27;s much less direct.<p>The article is correct that it&#x27;s a little insane to focus much on people living on GBI and writing a novel, and only marginally less insane to focus on people living on GBI and trying to, say, start a business that will genuinely prove to be economically expansionary, but I think it&#x27;s less crazy to focus on people whose employability is currently below the floor of the minimum wage, but who might be worth taking a chance on at a very low wage.",1421367854

Startups, as a whole,  benefit from other startups <i>far</i> more than they compete w/them. We in America or Europe can only benefit from an improved startup ecosystem around the world, as customers, investors and founders .. and most importantly as human beings.<p>Many successful startups, for example, were directly conceived as ways to fix the problems of other startups. Indirectly, a startup such as Uber was only possible due to the mass adoption of technology driven by Apple, Google (and Samsung, Xiaomi etc) and an app ecosystem invigorated by hundreds of other startups.<p>There is certainly competition within industries or niches, i.e. Uber vs Lyft. But the &quot;startup space&quot; is really about creating new (or at least re-configuring existing) niches in the &quot;non-startup&quot; world.<p>So while I doubt this particular initiative will work, or even get close to returning the investment, we certainly shouldn&#x27;t fear its success.

8896361,comment,8894146,8894146,0,0,doctorpangloss,,,"> Poorer families care more about other factors — and less about academics. The study split families up into thirds based on the median income in their census tract. What they found was that the lowest-income New Orleans families were even more likely to pick schools that were close by, that offered extended days, and that had football and band in high school — and, conversely, they had a weaker preference for schools based on test scores.<p>Are we convinced that choosing schools by their test scores is the best way to choose schools?<p>The researchers started with a simple premise. Charter schools deliver equality only if parents prefer schools with higher test scores. Clearly some parents don&#x27;t.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine a universe where a better football program actually ends up being a wiser choice for your child than better test scores. Does anyone think we&#x27;re better off, on average, even considering football to be more important? It just seems like test scores being more important is far and away the right answer.<p>So for me, the real question is, is there a way to convince parents that test scores are really all that matters without resorting to full-blown jingoism? More precisely, do we have to coerce the idea that test scores matter more than football?<p>Effective education systems have all sorts of coercion, and the most successful ones tend to treat test scores as the #1 priority. German high school students are tracked into different tiers of educational attainment. German laws restrict the ability of private schooling to provide an alternative to the national system&#x27;s decision, &quot;Test scores are important, your child is stupid, and he&#x27;s going to become an apprentice.&quot; Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve learned that some Korean parents track their poor-performing daughters into performance arts (i.e., playing violin and singing). And in my top-ranked public high school, we ghettoize students into honors/non-honors starting Freshman year. My takeaway from these high-performing scholastic environments: the child doesn&#x27;t choose how important test scores are. The system chooses for them, and it chose &quot;test scores are important.&quot;<p>If charter schools are to succeed, and indeed any objective educational reform, I tend to agree with the implied argument of these researchers. Test scores are more important. Now, what do we do with the people who disagree?",1421367175

There have already been papers showing that what is now called &quot;anomymized&quot; can be trivially deanonymized by mashing together other data sets and some computing power. Trying to hold on to the concept of anonymized data is futile - the <i>reality itself</i> is highly correlated and interconnected, and all those causal relationships will be reflected in the colected datasets. The more data sources you have, the easier is to deanonymize them all together.<p>So the choice is - either stop collecting data or accept that there ain&#x27;t such thing as anonymity. What we definitely shouldn&#x27;t do is fooling ourselves that we can do both. Datasets are and will be trivially deanonymized if anyone cares to do so.<p>EDIT:<p>> <i>Data doesn&#x27;t need names, places, faces, phone numbers, geolocation and social media accounts correlated and updated in realtime</i><p>Names - social studies.

Right now those sciences mostly keep faking &quot;lifelike&quot; conditions to test some theories and we all know how much problem there is with small sample sizes, unrealistic experiment setups, etc. Inferences based on natural patterns of behaviour of millions, or even billions of people would be much, much more reliable.

Without demeaning them by forcing them to demonstrate that they can&#x27;t hold down a job right now.  Thereby leading to endless arguments about whether they are truly incapacitated or simply lazy.<p>To me that&#x27;s a pretty good social reason for preferring unconditional handouts.",1421366606

7605923,comment,7605592,7605592,12,0,firstOrder,,,"> Government had nothing to do with Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Zuckerberg<p>Gates and Jobs built their companies on the microprocessor, the development of which was completely dependent upon government contacts to Fairchild.<p>Zuckerberg&#x27;s debt is even more so - the Internet was a government funded R&D project from 1969 until the 1991 entry of ANS/CIX.  He built his business on top of a 20+ year government project, just like Google and other businesses did.  To say that the government had nothing to do with it is absurd, and just highlighting Gordon&#x27;s own ignorance of how technology, and for that matter the economy, works.<p>Just looking at the official government forms, tens of billions in military contracts have come into the Peninsula over the past decade ( <a href=""http://www.governmentcontractswon.com/department/defense/california_counties.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.governmentcontractswon.com/department/defense/cal...</a> ).

If you own your network, and you own all the resources in your network, and you control how they operate, I can&#x27;t think of a good reason you would need services like this, other than a generalized want for dynamic scaling of a service provider (which doesn&#x27;t really work without your application being designed for it, or an intermediary/backend application designed for it).<p>Load balancing an increase of requests by incrementally adding resources is what most people want when they say they want to scale. You don&#x27;t need decentralized services to provide this. What do decentralized services provide, then? &quot;Resilience&quot;. In the face of a random failure of a node or service, another one can take its place. Which is also accomplished with either network or application central load balancing. What you don&#x27;t get [inherently] from decentralized services is load balancing; sending new requests to some poor additional peer simply swamps it. To distribute the load amongst all the available nodes, now you need a DHT or similar, and take a slight penalty from the efficiency of the algorithm&#x27;s misses/hits.<p>All the features that tools like this provide - a replicated key/value store, health checks, auto discovery, network event triggers, service discovery, etc - can all be found in tools that work based on centralized services, while remaining scalable. I guess my point is, before you run off to your boss waving an iPad with Consul&#x27;s website on it demanding to implement this new technology, try to see if you <i>need it</i>, or if you just think it&#x27;s really cool.<p>It&#x27;s also kind of scary that the ability of an entire network like Consul&#x27;s to function depends on minimum numbers of nodes, quorums, leaders, etc. If you believe the claims that the distributed network is inherently more robust than a centralized one, you might not build it with fault-tolerant hardware or monitor them adequately, resulting in a wild goose chase where you try to determine if your app failures are due to the app server, the network, or one piece of hardware that the network is randomly hopping between. Could a bad switch port cause a leader to provide false consensus in the network? Could the writes on one node basically never propagate to its peers due to similar issues? How could you tell where the failure was if no health checks show red flags? And is there logging of the inconsistent data/states?",1397763566

7605788,comment,7603570,7604636,3,0,ckozlowski,,,"Certainly. Rather than retype the wheel though, I&#x27;m going to rely on some various posts:<p>Gabe spells it out pretty well here: <a href=""http://www.gabesvirtualworld.com/how-too-many-vcpus-can-negatively-affect-your-performance/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gabesvirtualworld.com/how-too-many-vcpus-can-nega...</a><p>In a previous environment of mine, we ran dual socket, 4-way CPUs. VMs were configured with a mix of 1, 2, and 4 vCPU VMs. Our VMs appeared slow, especially on our 4-way systems. However, CPU utilization was low. More digging revealed that our co-stop values were high, meaning that the system couldn&#x27;t schedule execution time effectively, meaning the VM had to sit in a READY state, which kept CPU utilization low.<p>Our first fix was to rebalance our cluster, so that 1 and 2 vCPU VMs were relegated to their own set of hosts, and our 4 vCPU VMs executed on their own set. Instantly, out co-stop values dropped, and CPU utilization rates went up...they were now doing work!<p>VMware briefly talks about the issue here: <a href=""http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/search.do?cmd=displayKC&docType=kc&docTypeID=DT_KB_1_1&externalId=1005362"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/search.do?cmd=displayKC&doc...</a><p>If you&#x27;d really like the nuts and bolts of it, then those can be found here: <a href=""https://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/techpaper/VMware-vSphere-CPU-Sched-Perf.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/techpaper/VMware-vSphere-CP...</a><p>The VMware co-scheduler has improved over the years, but I still read (The &quot;Mastering vSphere 5.5&quot; book by Scott Lowe carries a warning on this as well) that carefully balancing vCPUs is a must in a VMware environment. (Again, I don&#x27;t believe Linode uses VMware, so I can&#x27;t say with any certainty that KVM or Xen exhibit this behavior.)<p>So why can&#x27;t we run 8 vCPUs on one physical one? Because while they&#x27;re virtual to some extent, they&#x27;re not completely abstracted. Anytime the hypervisor has to perform a translation between the guest OS and the host, a performance penalty is incured. So while the hypervisor may abstract scheduling, it reveals as much of the physical CPU to the guest VM as possible. Here&#x27;s a little blurb from an older VMware manual explaining a bit of the difference:\n<a href=""http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-4-esx-vcenter/index.jsp?topic=/com.vmware.vsphere.resourcemanagement.doc_41/managing_cpu_resources/c_understanding_cpu_virtualization.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-4-esx-vcenter/index.jsp?topic...</a><p>CPU virtualization =/= emulation<p>For this reason, (again, at least in a VMware environment) we can&#x27;t give a VM more vCPUs than exist pCPUs to align them to.<p>Hope this helps!",1397763131

7605700,comment,7604787,7605498,3,0,hardwaresofton,,,"tldr; centralize, and you have single point of failure, that&#x27;s bad for distributed systems. you can have multiple DBs, but how will your app know about them, if they&#x27;re brought up dynamically? You&#x27;ll have to stop instances, possibly modify some code/env/something, and keep those changes in your head.<p>Well so the problem is, as soon as you centralize, you introduce a single point of failure, which is a no-no if you&#x27;re looking for as pure of a distributed system as you can get (distributed systems have their flaws, but single-point-of-failure systems have been worked past at this point, generally the drawbacks are expressed in terms of number of non-faulty/byzantine nodes).<p>While it is definitely true that if the cluster completely collapses, service discovery won&#x27;t work anyway, but as that is very rare (hopefully), the thinking here is that what if your centralized cassandra cluster fails? You would need to replicate everything to something else, and once you start preparing for those kinds of failures, you&#x27;re already building a distributed system.<p>NOTE: I am assuming here that you mean ONE machine running cassandra... if you mean multiple, then the stuff below doesnt&#x27; really apply, if cassandra handles dynamic node changing well... but still, why not abstract? Why not make EVERY service you&#x27;re running app/db/cache/app2/utility know about dynamic changes to architecture?<p>What do you mean by &quot;losing your data store?&quot; -- from what I understand, a consul agent runs on every machine and EVERY consul agent has an LMDB instance. If you mean losing your data store as in losing the service that provides your actual application data -- that would be the point of automatically discovering services, you could just arbitrarily add nodes that do the &quot;db&quot; service, and your nodes that run &quot;app&quot; would automatically know more &quot;db&quot;s showed up.<p>Forgive me if this is unnecessary explanation, but:<p>To illustrate this -- let&#x27;s say I have 3 servers, 2 are running instances of the app (5 instances each) and 1 big-RAM machine is running the DB. All 10 instances are relying on that DB to not go down. While there are many very very capable & reliable DBs out there (cassandra, postgres, etc), it&#x27;s dangerous to assume they will not fail.<p>However, the problem is, how do you just add nodes? You&#x27;re going to either need to change app code, change some env variables, or do some other kind of monkey patching to let some of the app processes (there are 10 of them) know which DB to use. Also, if you look at just the problem of adding instances of app processes for more load balancing, there are various static-y files that possibly need to change to accomodate (nginx/apache config, env variables,etc).<p>Again, someone correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but this is where Consul comes in. If app server 1 knows about at LEAST 1 of the DB clusters, you can easily add more DB clusters, and ask Consul about them. So, if one DB has gone down, and you have consul-aware code in place, consul can tell your app instances where to get their database data.<p>Like Cassandra, There are some DBs that make this really easy to do (spin up more DBs that can act as masters, or just backup read onlys, or whatever) -- rethinkdb is one of them (<a href=""http://rethinkdb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rethinkdb.com/</a>)... They have a really good web interface that makes adding and managing clusters as easy as starting up a rethinkdb service with some extra options telling it where the master is. However, cassandra seems like it doesn&#x27;t really handle dynamic node creation (I&#x27;m going off this page: <a href=""http://www.datastax.com/docs/0.8/install/cluster_init"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datastax.com/docs/0.8/install/cluster_init</a>). If it does, the case for an abstracted, dynamic service discovery still stands (cassandra might be OK, what about if you want to know about service x?)",1397762136

I live in Brazil and am in my 25s, I ended my graduation course and immediately started my msc degree. Finishing it and having being in touch only with academia until then, I quickly started working at a relatively good company (something like 6 months ago). It has been a great place for me. It acts in the almost same area I got my msc degree, it is near home, people here are great, and I have been praised a lot in the previous weeks - I would probably rise well here. The company itself it not really big, but it has a reasonable chance to rise greatly in the next months, but who knows how that will actually turn out.<p>Then, suddenly, I got an invitation to temporarily drop &quot;everything&quot; and move to Scotland within 2 months, to stay for a year and work on a small startup. I would receive £1000/month to survive there while working on the project. Considering my current work, that is not much, but the experience is what counts. The details here do not matter on the startup details or why I received an invitation with such short notice; my problem is weighting the plus and cons of each possibility. The appearance of an opportunity like that is rare for my lifestyle, so it may be unique. Such experience could be a life-changer, but I am not sure on how beneficial that would really be.<p>Dropping everything and traveling is the obvious right choice? \nIt seems to me that it -should- be the obvious one, but I do not feel certainty.",1397761782

Rent is not an investment at all, as you&#x27;ll get absolutely nothing back when you leave.

Knowing you&#x27;ll have a safe place to sleep is huge. Yeah, property taxes exist (far less than rent, which you&#x27;re paying in your rent anyway), and eminent domain may screw things up (unlikely if you choose wisely), but it&#x27;s far better than risking receipt of a notice saying &quot;sorry, but we&#x27;ve sold the building which will be demolished next month&quot;.<p>If nothing else, buy a $10,000 property somewhere (see zillow.com) and DIY build a $20,000 small house on it (lots of options available, search &quot;tiny house&quot;), cash as you go.

7605616,comment,7602617,7603803,1,0,catenate,,,"The redo-inspired build tool I wrote abstracts the tasks of composing\na build system, by replacing the idea of writing a build description\nfile with command-line primitives which customize production rules\nfrom a library.  So cleanly compiling a C file into an executable\nlooks something like this:<p>Find and delete standard list of files which credo generates, and derived objects which are targets of *.do scripts:<p>> cre/rm std<p>Customize a library template shell script to become the file hello.do,\nwhich defines what to do to make hello from hello.c:<p>> cre/libdo (c cc c &#x27;&#x27;) hello<p>Run the current build graph to create hello:<p>> cre/do hello<p>Obviously this particular translation is already baked into make,\nso isn&#x27;t anything new, but the approach of pulling templated\ntransitions from a library by name scales well to very custom\ntransitions created by one person or team and consumed at\nbuild-construction-time by another.<p>Also see other test cases at\n<a href=""https://github.com/catenate/credo/tree/master/test/1/credo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/catenate/credo/tree/master/test/1/credo</a> and a\nlibrary of transitions at\n<a href=""https://github.com/catenate/credo/tree/master/lib/do/sh-inferno"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/catenate/credo/tree/master/lib/do/sh-infe...</a><p>I think this approach reduces the complexity of the build system by\nseparating the definition of the file translations from the construction\nof a custom build system.  These primitives abstract constructing the\ndependency graph and production rules, so I think it&#x27;s also simpler\nto use.  Driving the build system construction from the shell also\nenables all the variability in that build system that you want without\ngenerating build-description files, which I think is new, and also\nsimpler to use than current build-tool approaches.  Whether all-DSL\n(eg make), document-driven (eg ant), or embedded DSL (eg scons),\nbuild tools usually force you to write or generate complicated build\ndescription files which do not scale well.<p>Credo is also inspired by redo, but runs in Inferno, which is even\nmore infrequently used than Go (and developed by some of the same\npeople).  I used Inferno because I work in it daily, and wanted to\ntake advantage of some of the features of the OS, that Linux and bash\ndon&#x27;t have.  Just today I ran into a potential user that was turned\noff by the Inferno requirement, so I&#x27;ll probably have to port it to\nLinux/bash, and lose some of those features (eg, /env), to validate\nits usability in a context other than my own.<p>EDIT: Replaced old way, to call script to find and delete standard derived objects, with newer command.",1397761308

I think what I mean is that, the purpose of the security is 2-fold, to prevent the loss of expensive equipment, and to make people think that the security is for their benefit so that they continue to fly/ride/whatever and keep those businesses afloat. It just so happens that lots of the things you have to do to keep an airplane (the equipment) safe are the same things you need to do to keep people safe.<p>If they were serious about the security of the people on the aircraft, they'd make it really simple instead of complex. Simple things like no carry-ons whatsoever and <i>every</i> flight has a marshal. None of this Monty Python-esque ""only 1 carry-on unless it's a 'personal item' in which case you get 2 or it's a Thursday but you can only get in it during the flight above 20,000ft and no later than 60 minutes before landing, but only if your point of origin is Minnesota during the month of November or Kansas during the Spring -- and if it's electronic in any way shape or form, forget about it, unless it has an 'airplane mode', or is a watch that can resist depths up to 60m"".<p><i>edit</i> the top story on reddit right now has this right

1019293,comment,1018763,1019051,0,0,physcab,,,"As a material scientist myself, I was curious about their study.  So I pulled up their paper in JAP.<p>My first thought before reading was that the high intensity laser pulses were causing local heating such that any impurities in the solid (ie carbon) diffused onto the surface.  Nope, they did an EDS scan and platinum was clearly the dominant element.  There were traces of carbon but I think this was due to impurities in the microscope.<p>So basically what happens (my educated guess) is that the laser pulses break up the surface structure such that different phonon (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonon</a>) modes are excited when certain wavelengths of light are shined on the surface.  Just so happens that wavelengths in the visible range are absorbed so the sample appears black.  To create different colors, I guess they just found the correct amount of power and wavelength laser pulse to create the phonon mode that they need.<p>I don't believe they oversold their technique.  Scratching won't really cause this phenomenon.  Corrosion maybe, but I doubt they could achieve the same optical properties. Fragility is a legitimate concern, but I'm guessing that if they are interested in industrial applications they will do mechanical testing of the structures.<p>EDIT:  I'd also like to add that I think it's perfectly OK for a scientist to upsell their work.  We live and die by the grant system, and funding agencies are all looking for ""broader impacts.""  I'm rather impressed that their group was able to drum up this much press.",1262031437

PS: NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has used its Diviner instrument to probe the insides of permanently shadowed craters on Earth's satellite. It found mid-winter, night-time surface temperatures inside the coldest craters in the northern polar region can dip as low as minus 249C (26 Kelvin). <i>The Diviner instrument observed the lowest summer temperatures in the darkest craters at the southern pole to be about 35K (-238C);</i> but in the north, close to the winter solstice the instrument recorded a temperature of just 26K on the south-western edge of the floor of Hermite Crater.",1262031077

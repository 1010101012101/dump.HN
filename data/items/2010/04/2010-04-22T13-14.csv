The most correct explanation is that ""it's complicated"" and has to do with issues of class, mobility and race, but has little to do with the city ""failing to provide"" in fact, the reason white flight exists is because it is possible to engage the city without actually living in the city. A good example of this is detroit in the past hundred or so years.<p>I love that this article is essentially predicated on the idea that you should retain an american salary and live in a depressed economy where that is disproportionately large in relation to the average. This sort of white flight <i>actively diminishes</i> the tax base and local revenue in a negative feedback cycle more significantly than the increasing population of ""poorer people.""<p>I mean, if you want to leave the country, by all means, but don't expect it to take care of you once you're gone.<p>I'm reminded me of the closing paragraphs of a recent [NYT poll][survey] on the Tea Party movement:<p>> <i>...nearly three-quarters of those who favor smaller government said they would prefer it even if it meant spending on domestic programs would be cut.</i><p>> <i>But in follow-up interviews, Tea Party supporters said they did not want to cut Medicare or Social Security — the biggest domestic programs, suggesting instead a focus on “waste.”</i><p>> <i>Some defended being on Social Security while fighting big government by saying that since they had paid into the system, they deserved the benefits.</i><p>> <i>Others could not explain the contradiction.</i><p>> <i>“That’s a conundrum, isn’t it?” asked Jodine White, 62, of Rocklin, Calif. “I don’t know what to say. Maybe I don’t want smaller government. I guess I want smaller government and my Social Security.” She added, “I didn’t look at it from the perspective of losing things I need.

Issues related to network/gps availability in a war scenario could render it completely useless but, how hard could it be  to built something that provides GPS tracking with position sharing a la latitude + objectives highlighting/enemy pinpointing or the ability to store and retrieve basic objectives description (info on map)? Collect various data (collected directly from the usual device sensors or from some external peripheral connected to it) from this devices and present it in some tactical ""management"" overall view should be quite straightforward too.<p>Maybe it's too easy to build and the cost to implement it per soldier is too low too... this makes me think of that 50$ application that was used to intercept UAV video feeds... scary scenarios ahead.<p>* Every player has obviously a map view, can view other players in his squad and pinpoint enemy locations.",1271944355

1284982,comment,1280561,1284855,0,0,Maktab,,,"This, too, will be my last post. It has been interesting and there are no hard feelings from my side either.<p><i>>You might want to read this: <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jan/12/iraq-invasion-vi.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jan/12/iraq-invasion-vi...</a>. </i><p>While very persuasive (and an interesting read btw) that report still does not have the definitive weight of a UNSC resolution or UCJ ruling. And as I've said all along, the question of the legality of the original invasion is separate and irrelevant to the legality of the continued US presence in Iraq. I've been trying to avoid getting sucked into a discussion about the initial invasion only because I don't believe it's relevant to this specific discussion. That's all.<p><i>One last time: while the UN Security Council resolutions from UNSCR 1483 on, that you list, do not ipso facto make the occupation legal. There is not specific language declaring it to be legal, and absent that language, you cannot imply it to exist.</i><p>This is just it though, those resolutions (especially UNSCR 1511) are unambiguous and specific in making the presence of US-led coalition forces in Iraq legal. Your incorrect analysis of their content suggests that you don't have much experience in reading and interpreting UNSC resolutions and other instruments of international law. That's ok, but it might be worth scheduling a chat with an international law professor at a university near you if you want a deeper understanding.<p><i>(By the way, as I understand it, squatters rights only are possible when you don't break the law to enter.)</i><p>Not true, I mentioned that bit specifically because some countries have laws which enforce squatters' rights even when the initial occupation was unlawful. It makes sense though, as just because an initial action may be illegal it does not automatically render every subsequent action illegal.<p><i>I also think that Iraq is better off now, but that's an obtuse point.</i><p>I agree that it's pretty obtuse. I only mentioned it because you said that the people of Iraq will never see any of Iraq's wealth. I found that a curious statement. Perhaps I misinterpreted what you were trying to say.<p>In summary, I responded to your original post only because of one claim you made, which is that US forces are in Iraq illegally right now. The fact remains that even if you reject my assertion that the UNSC resolutions explicitly legalised the presence of US forces in Iraq under a Chapter VII mandate it still does not justify your claim that US forces are illegally occupying Iraq, because the US-Iraqi Status of Forces Agreement created an entirely new and separate legal framework under which US troops remain in the country. As a treaty between two sovereign governments, the SOFA supersedes anything that came before it and is unaffected by remaining questions about the legality of the initial invasion. It just makes no sense to refer to the current presence of US forces in Iraq as an 'illegal occupation' in 2010.",1271942978

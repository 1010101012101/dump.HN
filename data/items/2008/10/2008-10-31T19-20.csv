350293,comment,349630,349714,0,0,ars,,,"Waste disposal is a much smaller problem than people think. It's really not that much waste - you can store the waste of every plant ever made in the space that a single large coal mine and tailings takes.<p>I think the personal lifetime waste size for each person was something like a cup - we can find space for that somewhere on this very large earth.<p>Plus if you allow nuclear reprocessing, you can burn the fuel almost to nothing at all.<p>Right now renewable energy will not going to work. It's not enough, and it's not consistent enough. The only source with enough energy is sun, but that would require massive amounts of land use - I'd rather use a millionth of a percent of that land to store some nuclear waste.<p>On top of that storing the energy for use at night is problematic.<p>Except for sun, renewable will never be enough - there just isn't enough energy. And sun has it's own problems: it can be done if you use enough land (like all of texas), but that's not practical. You can put collectors on each roof, but that doesn't work, because right now they use almost as much energy to make as they produce over a reasonable time.<p>Today renewable is not going to work, and it probably never will. Don't wait for them, there are very large problems that will almost certainly make it impossible to supply energy solely with renewables.<p>The solution is this: nuclear for now. When materials science improves enough to put in a space tether you put in a collector in orbit and send power down the tether.<p>Sun power from space is the future, but without a tether it's too dangerous to send the power to earth.<p>Right now it's nuclear is the only realistic power source.<p>And besides, if we can be OK for right now, fusion power might eventually work.<p>You mentioned hydrogen. Hydrogen is a joke, it is totally unsuitable as a fuel. It's all but impossible to store. People have mostly given up on it, and if they didn't they should.<p>Hydrogen will leak out of just about any container ever made, and if it doesn't leak it will react with the material and damage it.",1225482766

It's proven, it works.<p>FB is headed this way with Connect, but Connect is too muddied, unproven, and relies too much on cooperation with 3rd parties.<p>A second set of customers, which in retrospect may be what you are referring to, are universities.  The alumni network websites of schools are inactive wastelands.  Facebook should be marketing walled garden solutions to Universities.

When they are ascendant, quite simply it is difficult to focus in the face of the constant irritation.<p>(These result from injuries, and the medical community has been less than definitive and less than helpful in finding solutions.)<p>My point is not a self-pity fest, but to say that, from personal experience, I've learned there are physical factors that can limit one's effort.  I think that some people who have not experienced this, don't realize nor understand it.<p>It is part of what makes community essential to achievement.  We all learn from others, and passing on our knowledge is essential to continuing this progress.  Similarly, people have times during which their ability to do for themselves is limited.  At those times, the community can help to get them out of that low spot.  (Whether family, friends, and/or a larger agency.)  The result is hopefully someone who can once again contribute to the community.  (Note that I'm not defining what that contribution should be.  In that regard, I support a free market of ideas and personal interests.)<p>It seems to me that for people who claim to value life, this should be a pretty basic understanding.  And yet we have this persistent notion of the self-made person.  In moderation, it's a good idea.  Everyone has to find their own path and success.  Taken to extremes, we end up with ""survival of the fittest"".  This is a workable means of defining hierarchy, but it fails to investigate resource optimization where an investment in another may yield larger dividends.  And it is at odds with that espoused viewpoint of ""valuing life"" in a general sense.  It may limit the scope of cooperative ventures.  And this is a time where human ventures are ever more complicated and in need of such cooperative effort.<p>Individual effort is indeed necessary.  But we need to look also as a community at what enables that effort, and where there are limitations, to work on removing them.

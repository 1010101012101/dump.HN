1488712,comment,1488125,1488357,0,0,herewego,,,"I disagree. You are talking about the relational model conceptually. The author is talking about the relational model as it is implemented in today's RDBMS solutions.<p>You elude to this in the last paragraph of your comment. Having a horrible experience horizontally scaling, for example, is ample reason enough to look into document databases. Largely because the current implementations of document databases allow for ease of partitioning in a way that the current implementations of RDBMS' don't.<p>The author doesn't imply that document datastores are free lunches. They're simply alternatives and he goes on to say that document datastores are better for some problem domains than others.<p>Also, you oversimplify the difficulties in implementing a highly-performant document datastore by implying that data should be normalized and that storing the data on disk is an optimization layer. This comment comes off as being written by someone who is ignorant of how document disk storage is implemented and why it is so fast. Doing what you suggest would very likely result in a datastore that was drastically slower than the currently implemented document datastores or even key/value datastores for that matter (MongoDB, CouchDB, Cassandra, etc).<p>Will we someday perhaps have the end-all-be-all of RDBMS's that merges the feature-set of current RDBMS's and the performance of document/key-value datastores? Maybe, but until then, they're alternatives to each other that generally succeed in providing solutions for the problems for which they were designed:<p>* RDBMS - consistency, transactions, predictable schema, etc.\n* Document/Key-Value - horizontal scalability, raw performance, flexible schema, etc.<p>Different solutions for different problem domains.",1278352630

In CL you can use an alist, a plist, a struct, or CLOS.<p><i>I've gotten used to thinking in terms of symbols so much that I find it hard to go back</i><p>Given that Lisp's history with symbolic computing goes back to the beginning, something about that doesn't sound right.<p>Your person->name comment reminds me of something, by the way. Portions of our app run in both CL and JS (via the Parenscript library). This is relatively easy, although there are a few disagreements between the two that you have to watch out for (such as how they handle null). Anyway, there are lots of CL features we've ""ported"" to JS via macros, but there is also one JS feature I found myself envying so much that I finally wrote a partial implementation of it in CL. That is JS's willingness to allow you to stick any property on any object just by setting it. It's a rather Lispy feature since it's maximally dynamic and maximally flexible. I find it handy for incremental development. When you have some data about a thing that you want to associate with it, but only some of the time, it's a real pain to have to make a separate data structure to hold it and then make sure it gets passed alongside the original thing to all the appropriate places. Our CL implementation of this is pretty crude but it allows the important thing, which is that you can write (@ something :some-data) and (setf (@ something :some-data) ""blah"") pretty much wherever you want. So we can be said to have Greenspunned a bit of JS in Lisp!",1278351623

The constraints still exist, they're just not explicit in the data model, meaning that when your network partition gets joined up again and it magically merges all those changes at the key-value level, you may be ending up with data that's broken in subtle, difficult-to-track-down ways because other implicit constraints weren't respected by the merge.<p>So, merging changes in a way that respects constraints which apply to that data, is a hard problem in general. Key/value stores, with their less-structured data model, sweep that problem under the carpet somewhat in order to make things easier in distributed settings. Relational databases suffer from trying to address the problem more fully.",1278350530

There are a few essential papers that you need to read to get the full picture; Here they are collected in an archive. Nearly all of them assume nothing more than rudimentary familiarity with Lisp, some functional programming (Scheme and tiny bit of ML) and they're geared towards someone with some C, machine-org and assembly knowledge.<p><a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2083231/essential_lisp_implementation_papers.tar.gz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2083231/essential_lisp_implementatio...</a><p>I would recommend these to someone who wants to implement a functional or a Lisp language, going with nothing but basic systems programming knowledge.<p>Recommend prerequisites are the first 2-3 chapters of SICP, some familiarity with classic compiler construction (dragon book would do, skip the lexical analysis and parsing parts though; you wont need much of that for Lisp if you retool and existing lexer. But focus on function calling and stack discipline, lexical scope and variable visibility, and maybe learn how an Algol dialect implements runtime heap-allocation) some exposure to C and assembly, and healthy curiosity.<p>A suggested order might be: Ghuloum, Wilson, Dybvig, the uncredited ""lisp-implementation.pdf"" paper, Gudeman, Kelsey, then Shao (Shao might make a whole lot more sense if you read one of Andrew Appel's compiler books and dip a tiny bit into ML.)",1278349998

In toppling ActiveX, the iPhone (and the phones it inspired) got a gift from Windows Mobile, by being so stagnant that it left a huge opening. But the iPhone now has a credible competitor in Android, with newly-minted Flash support. And Mozilla has high-quality competitors that offer H.264 support. (Chrome will support both WebM and H.264, so Google isn't taking the hard-line stance that would follow if they valued breaking H.264 over immediate gains in market share.)<p>For now, Apple has the iPad's market to itself, which gives it great latitude to further weaken Flash.

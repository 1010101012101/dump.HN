Probably just better off locking up people like that forever. Heck, if even 1 out of 10 of them repeated if let out at age 40, what a horrible mess for no good cause. String of crimes including violently abusing an elderly woman? Yeah, that pretty much forfeits all claims on your sovereignty and freedom.<p>> Mr. Graham, 22, was sentenced to a year in jail and three yearsâ€™ probation for a 2003 robbery of a Jacksonville restaurant, during which an accomplice beat the manager with a steel bar. Mr. Graham was sentenced to life in 2005 for violating probation by committing a home invasion robbery when he was 17.<p>Repeated violent crime, followed by more crime on probation? Again, what's the downside of locking him up forever? That it might be nicer or more proper to let him go after a long time, let him back into society with no skills or acclimation to the outside world? In days before society had resources to imprison people, both of those violent criminals almost certainly would've been executed and society would've moved on.<p>Now, I'm against the death penalty typically outside of states of emergency, because executing even one innocent man is a terrible thing. But if someone's repeatedly hurting people from a very young age, it doesn't seem like there's any gain to letting them loose after 20 years, and potentially a heck of a lot of bad that could happen.",1257655596

928821,comment,928054,928482,0,0,camccann,,,"Many-worlds isn't really a silly concept. It's one of several interpretations that are equally consistent with current experimental results, and it does have nice properties such as avoiding nondeterminism and nonlocality. It's also (in a way) a conceptually simpler theory, in that many-worlds is roughly what you'd have if you got rid of wave function collapse and naively applied the rest of quantum mechanics. If memory serves me, a substantial percentage of physicists consider many-worlds to be plausible, or even likely.<p>Also, be careful when talking about ""observation having a bearing on reality""--the quantum mechanical sense of ""observing"" state has little to do with the conventional meaning of the word, and absolutely nothing to do with the presence of a conscious observer. On the other hand, an ""observer"" in the anthropic sense, in the quantum suicide experiment, is generally assumed to be a conscious being (though this isn't strictly required).",1257655545

If it had stopped after him giving the first site his cell phone number, and if he would have then been redirected back to the game and credited with his coins, it would simply be a bad offer, but not a particularly dirty one. You would pay thirty bucks for a random number between 100-144, and your virtual coins.<p>My guess is that they made sure to clean up the first service so that it looks legit, and you only discover that it's a scam if you actually go through with it, and if you do, they're just piling on the cash-grabs. I cannot imagine that any of the following services are aware that the user came from a game and that some virtual currency should be credited back.<p>So the results of this story is that they're going to clean up the second set of services so it looks legit when you're two steps removed, and then pile on the cash-grabs, hoping no-one digs that deep.<p>It is also really important to remember that the biggest beneficiaries of these scams are the mobile networks themselves. If you've ever worked with mobile payments you know that they always take more than half of the money. Payout rates average at 45% throughout the world. Compare that to other payment methods such as PayPal which charges 6%, or roll your own solution and get down to 3%.<p>It's a cash machine for all the networks, they have no liability, almost no costs for the transactions, and they still get the lion's share of the money, so they have absolutely no incentive to stop the scammers.<p>So attacking this problem only from the Facebook side is probably not as effective as if you could force the networks to get rid of the scammers, but I have no hope of that ever happening, all the money they're making on it can buy a lot of lobbying to keep that money rolling.",1257652945

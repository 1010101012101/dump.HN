Several simply let me know they will be praying for me and praying hard. One student explained that as a devout Catholic he had no choice but to reject evolution. He accused me of fabricating the pope’s statements. When I explained that he could go to the Vatican website for verification or call the Vatican to talk to a scientist, he insisted that there was no such information available from the Vatican. He then pointed his finger at me and said the only way he would believe me is if Pope John Paul II came to my class to confirm these quotes face-to-face. The student then stomped out, again slamming the auditorium door behind him.&quot;<p>From the Pope&#x27;s mouth (2007):<p><a href=""http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/speeches/2007/july/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20070724_clero-cadore.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/speeches/2007/j...</a><p>&quot;Currently, I see in Germany, but also in the United States, a somewhat fierce debate raging between so-called &quot;creationism&quot; and evolutionism, presented as though they were mutually exclusive alternatives: those who believe in the Creator would not be able to conceive of evolution, and those who instead support evolution would have to exclude God. This antithesis is absurd because (...) there are so many scientific proofs in favour of evolution which appears to be a reality we can see and which enriches our knowledge of life and being as such.&quot;",1427554108

Although i don&#x27;t know C++ well enough to be sure.<p>Spring started life as a dependency injection framework, and that still constitutes the central part of it. Dependency injection is the mechanism by which components of an application are created and assembled, and so there was a natural expansion of Spring into providing those components. Spring now provides a web framework, plumbing for database persistence, batch processing, and all sorts of other things:<p><a href=""https://spring.io/platform"" rel=""nofollow"">https://spring.io/platform</a><p>AIUI, Boost is a collection of libraries. Spring is much more frameworky than that. The general approach with Spring is to add a particular module to your project, sprinkle a few magic annotations on your code, then watch in wonder as lots of sophisticated stuff happens, exactly as Spring&#x27;s designers foresaw. Usually.<p>There are two main alternatives to Spring. Firstly, Java EE, which is similar in spirit, smaller in extent, and the product of a decades-long standards process involving some of the world&#x27;s most ponderous companies, but really not as bad as that might suggest:<p><a href=""http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/overview/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/overview/index...</a><p>And in fact, i&#x27;d describe Spring as an alternative to Java EE, rather than vice versa.<p>Secondly, not using a framework at all, and just putting everything together yourself. To a large extent, Dropwizard etc are the result of people doing this, then posting the reusable bits of their application to GitHub.<p>Java&#x27;s equivalent of Boost is probably some combination of Apache Commons:<p><a href=""http://commons.apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commons.apache.org/</a><p>And Google Guava:<p><a href=""https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/</a><p>The difference is that if you&#x27;re using Spring, then you are writing a Spring application. Every part of your code will be pervaded by Spring, and you will have to do things in the way Spring prescribes. If you&#x27;re using Commons or Guava, your application is your own, and those libraries will crop up here and there, where you choose to use them.",1427553866

After all, children can be traumatized with routine verbal abuse as well as physical.<p>&quot;After all, pets can be controlled without hitting. Why can&#x27;t kids?&quot;<p>Pets have substantially different brain structures and the ability to learn from negative feedback of any sort is highly variable. My understanding is that dogs <i>can</i> learn from it, but do best if the feedback is immediate, otherwise they&#x27;re at risk of just feeling randomly attacked, and they start getting pretty neurotic. But birds can just about never learn from negative feedback. And, of course, we have substantially different sets of expectations for humans than we do for pets.",1427552143

Seems good enough. I haven&#x27;t tried download speed though. For what it is worth, downloading files from the web interface in Microsoft OneDrive (previously SkyDrive) is ridiculously slow.<p>I think there is a distinction to be made between syncing (Dropbox, Google Drive, Barracuda Copy, Microsoft OneDrive and so on) and back ups. The providers try to blur the lines with features like trash can (where files go when you delete and you have to delete again), file history so you can go to a previous version of a file, selective synchronization so you can only download files you need and so on. However, I&#x27;d say the distinction still remains because we need to measure backups by how easily and quickly we can recover in case of a disaster.<p>At 10 TB, I&#x27;d imagine OP falls in the latter category.

We are building data discovery and analytics tools that make it simple for organizations to liberate their own private data, and for the wider community to explore and build upon Enigma’s own integrated public data platform.

levimatan,,5,0.0,2,5,"My name is Matan Levi and I currently live in Tel Aviv, Israel.<p>I have a BSc in Computer Science with an emphasis in IT & Security. I just my MBA (Cum Laude), which was focused on Entrepreneurship and Technology Management.<p>I started developing at the age of 8 and I am very passionate about coding, technology and brain challenges.<p>From the age of 16, I felt that I needed to create something new, something that will make a change and a stamp in the world. Since then I tried 7 different projects, such as: starting a porn site (before turning 18), Warez web site for a girl I had a crash on (didn&#x27;t we all :) ), zollpo.com with a friend, xrefunds.com with 2 friends, a development company called AMZTeam, Facebook app called DumpedU, several iPhone apps (Military Points, iCParking, Wake On Lan) and more.<p>I have over nine years of experience in software development, knowledge in all steps of product life cycle. I served in an elite programming unit in the IDF, started as a developer and was promoted to Team Leader and managed 5-17 soldiers / external employees. Promotions continued to Project Manager, Technology Researcher and Cadets Commander. After I finished my army service (more than 7 years) in a Captain rank I started working at Cyber-Ark Software as a software engineer and 3 month after, was promoted to Team Leader and managed 4 employees.<p>During those nine years I understood how to manage a team in an agile methodology, how to work with high end technology and how to problem solve (technical / flow / people). One of the best lessons I learned was during my last start-up, xrefunds.com. We worked 9 month on a cross platform app and a web platform, wrote a business plan, ran from investor to VC trying to raise money and met a lot of customers. I realized that in order to succeed I have to put all of my attention and focus in my start up and when I get an offer for a small investment I should take it and not wait for 1M$+ investment. From now on, I will be agile in all of the start-up aspects.<p>In my free time I love to read business and psychology books and play sports (water ski, snow boarding, rock climbing, skydiving, sailing, flying, soccer, racket ball, golf and much more). I am very competitive so be aware:)",1362743928,1450207814

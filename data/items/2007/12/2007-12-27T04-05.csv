Advertising and media get slammed in real recessions (2001 wasn't one), which is rather disastrous for Web2.0 as I understand it.  Opportunity, or at least security, is largely limited to the non-discretionary side of the economy.<p>I read PG saying you should ignore recessions because nobody can time them.  Well, that's just not true.  People with solid macro-economic grounding have always understood roughly where we are in the business cycle.  If you rely on the newspapers and NBER pronouncements for your understanding of the economy you will have the impression that it's all guesswork, but that only reflects on MSM incompetence and conflict of interest with advertisers.",1198731049

92888,comment,92644,92710,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"I don't think it's a coincidence that the financial system peaked out at roughly the same time global oil production peaked.  We ARE in a real energy crisis.  A big fraction of humanity in the poorer parts can no longer afford gasoline or heating oil.  Oil has quintupled in recent years.<p>The 1929 crisis was of purely financial origins.  It was rather basically a cheap credit bubble.  The bubble we're in now is both financial and a raw materials/energy crisis.  These dynamically related forces may together put us in a very bad position.  Oil, natural gas, fresh water, grains, fish, metals -- production of all these things are hitting physical limits and shooting up in price, progressively constraining economic opportunity.",1198729051

This is often the hardest step, because from a 10,000-foot level, you often can't tell what will be interesting, and whichever field you dive into will shut off various other opportunity costs.<p>Then, go to your favorite graduate school website.  I'm partial to Stanford and MIT, because both put up fairly complete syllabi on the web, including textbooks and often homework assignments.  Pick out a couple courses, just as if you were back in college, and note down the textbooks.<p>Then go to Amazon.com (or Amazon.co.uk, when I was in college Europe had much better textbook prices, I dunno if they've closed that loophole) and search for those textbooks.  And when it pops up ""Related books"" with good ratings, add those to your cart as well.  Buy them.<p>Read, rinse, and repeat.

1922103,story,,,2,6,jknupp,"Tell HN: How I lost 25 pounds on the simplest diet ever.",,"Since graduating college 6 years ago, I've put on about 50 lbs. I've tried various workouts/diets with marginal success, but this is by far the most effective and it's so easy it's almost silly.<p>The diet: Stop eating. Losing weight for most people is simple math; calories burned must be greater than calories taken in. I work in software development and get no exercise; I'm basically sedentary. My body doesn't need a lot of calories.<p>The specifics: <i>Do not eat breakfast or lunch</i>. Only drink non-caloric drinks during the day. Initially you may get very hungry during your normal mealtimes. That's where the drinks come in. Diet soda, water, diet iced tea, etc can be used to trick your body for a while since you're getting something in your stomach. Eventually, your body adapts and stops sending the ""hunger"" signal during the day and you rarely every really feel ""hungry"". Combat any residual hunger with fluids, but you should notice your hunger decreasing. The first two weeks or so is the only part that may take some will-power.<p>Now the fun part: For dinner, eat whatever you want. I live in NYC and literally order out for dinner every night. I eat a good ammount of food for dinner and rarely watch what I eat (but don't go overboard, it's shockingly easy to eat an entire day's worth of calories in one sitting without realizing it, especially with fast food). Make sure that vegetables are at least a part of your meal, or eat them separately after dinner.<p>The results are amazing. I really do nothing, it requires almost no willpower becuase I never get hungry anymore, and I can eat whatever I want for dinner (or go out for drinks and food after work/on the weekend). The weight is literally melting off. 25 pounds in 8 weeks is a healthy pace. And I did it by basically doing nothing. Also, eating only dinner has helped me with difficulty getting to sleep. Go figure. Scott Adam's recent blog post about being hungry has proved true for me. I find I play chess much better when I haven't eaten yet.<p>One thing to keep in mind: if you take a multi-vitamin (and you should), make sure you take it AFTER EATING as otherwise you'll just urinate most of it out (Thanks to my nutritionist mom for pointing this out).<p>The usual caveats apply: I am not a doctor, this is not to be construed as medical advice. Speak with your doctor before starting any diet.",1290189459

1922083,comment,1921705,1921705,0,0,grellas,,,"There is no magic to working 8 hours every day or any other number for that matter.<p>Before the industrial revolution, most people were farmers. They got up at sunrise and typically worked long, hard days in the fields - workdays that were not circumscribed by any arbitrary time limit but rather defined by whatever it took to deal with the exigencies of each day.<p>The 8-hour day, as some sort of idealized goal, came about as a direct result of the industrial revolution. With people moving to cities and taking up factory work, reformers began to characterize such work situations as exploitative, particularly of children but also of adults in terms of length of hours worked in physically demanding situations. The answer for reformers lay in having governments prescribe maximum normative work periods, with anything in excess of the prescribed maximum being deemed extraordinary and warranting extraordinary compensation. Hence, in America, we eventually got the 8-hour day and the 40-hour week. (See, e.g., <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day</a> for an overview).<p>I don't think ""corporate America"" has any particular stake in the 8-hour day. If anything, employers would undoubtedly <i>want</i> to have the power to shape the work schedules of employees in more flexible ways, especially by being able to freely demand longer work hours at normal compensation as a condition of continued employment. Of course, this would require repeal of the wage-and-hour laws that today proscribe any such thing. My point, though, is that it is those laws and not any scheme by employers that keeps the 8-hour structure in place as the normative work environment.<p>Bottom line: given pure freedom of contract, people could work any schedules they want and, in fact do so (that is what it means to be in business for yourself); however, given the problems arising from pure freedom of contract, the law imposes rigid limits deemed beneficial from a societal perspective on what may be expected of employees. That, I believe (and, I don't think, any other major factor), is what requires most people to work 8-hour schedules as their normative workday, at least in the U.S.<p>On a final note: the typical startup environment is really a throwback to the freedom of farming days because, in the earliest stages, there basically are no formal employees but rather just founders working round-the-clock like madmen for what might often be described as ""below dirt wages,"" and, in later stages, there are large numbers of ""exempt"" engineers who are not subject to the overtime rules and hence who are also working insane hours - thus, not too many 8-hour days in your prototypical startup. I don't think most of the participants regard this as exploitation, probably because most of it is self-driven, i.e., most such people want to drive themselves hard in order to succeed.",1290189187

And yet, they have basically released (and subsequently canned) one failure after another for a long time.<p>Even the advertising systems and related tools (Google Analytics and the like) are pretty poor in terms of usability/APIs; people use these tools because of Google's place in the market and because they give a lot of goodies away for free, not because the tools themselves are particularly good.<p>And even web search, the heart of Google's operation, isn't what it used to be: they seem to have become victims of their own success, with so many people out to game the system that a lot of their results pages aren't worth the time to type in a search term any more.<p>It's not clear how much of this is down to culture or management factors, and how much is just the unavoidable consequence of being the biggest kid on the playground. But either way, a <i>lot</i> of people at Google must have worked on projects like, say, Wave, and it's tough as a developer to put your heart into a job only to see it canned because it wasn't promoted effectively or the timing just wasn't right for the market.<p>Meanwhile, for all the extra features and so on, Facebook basically only has one product, and it's one of the most successful on the planet.<p>Other things being equal, which culture is going to be more fun to work in?

The comments that intend to contrast the differences between processing power, dimensions, and available network resources of ""desktop"" versus ""mobile"" devices are predicated on the notion that users <i>do</i> want you to send gobs of data that consume more resources when they are on desktop machines.  In general, however, they don't.  Witness the comments in ""Your social widgets are losing you visitors right now"" (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1771607"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1771607</a>) and the popularity of Readability. (<a href=""http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/</a>)<p>Something I think (self-apologetic and self-described) Web ""designers"" and ""UX experts"" in the West don't realize is that bandwidth caps still exist even for home use, and in some places they are the norm.<p>Given the reactions, it seems when people read the suggestion ""serve the same content to all browsers"", they see ""serve mobile users the same content that you serve on your created-with-the-desktop-in-mind ('full') Web site"".  Perhaps this should be reworded to explicitly say the inverted form: ""serve the same content on your full Web site as you serve on your mobile Web site.""  Surprise!  Mobile users aren't the only ones who like to view content created with ease-of-consumption in mind.<p>[Cue dissent pointing out that I did use the word ""consumption"", followed by some bullshit suggestion like ""Mobile users are primarily consumers while desktop users usually want to engage with the content.""  Such a suggestion ignores that a non-trivial part of the mobile-use population does seek to interact similarly while on a mobile device, as well as the non-trivial part of the desktop-use population that is mostly only ever annoyed by the extra cruft that gets sent down because they weren't recognized as being on a mobile device.  This is due no small part to the fact that there are no such things as a discrete mobile-use population and a discrete desktop-use population.  It's the same population coming to the table with varying modes of access.]<p>And finally, here's something that I've been trying to hammer on for a while.  I have a not-modestly sized screen.  I <i>should</i> be able to manage applications and Web pages so that I have multiple things visible on the screen at the same time, such as two pages that I'm cross referencing side-by-side; or a page open with some other application visible at the side; or, say, Songbird—displaying lyrics from the Web or band information from Wikipedia—in a way that <i>doesn't</i> take up most of the screen; or any other application which seeks to similarly integrate content from the Web but doesn't conform to the now-ancient assumption of one big browser window displaying the page contents over most of the screen.<p>Now with the proliferation of wide screens and increasingly large displays, I <i>should</i> be able to consume things in this way, and it <i>should</i> be an option for you to build these types of applications without annoyances like requiring horizontal scrolling.ⁱ  Instead of being able to take advantage of these opportunities, we get questions asking, ""Can we require even more screen space for our Web pages now?""

The cost might be unfulfilled childwishes or no one to take care of the elderly.  What is <i>not</i> a cost is the happiness these unborn miss out on.  There is no one to experience the ""missing out on happiness"" (which is really just another form of suffering).<p>Regarding ""forcing"" someone into being: you have a problem with my words, not with my reasoning.  As I said, birth can be a harm because the victim is still around to suffer its consequences.  Death or ""never being born"" cannot.<p>Most people disagree that people can't be harmed by birth.  Women are rather sternly discouraged to use alcohol during pregnancy.  It is frowned upon for people with any significant genetic problems to reproduce.  Incest is also taboo.  Many people would think it better if the poor would not have kids.  This has no bearing on the truth, of course, but I would be surprised if you didn't make similar judgments.  It is clear that there are at least <i>some</i> cases where pre-existent beings' future well-being is taken into consideration.<p>The question then becomes ""where do you draw the line?"", and reason would draw it where I do (at ""nobody should procreate"").  The idea is simple, if you're willing to suppress your inner pedant: those who are never born do not suffer and they do not miss out on anything.  This is the bottom line, and all the pedantry in the world won't change this fact.<p>The only case that <i>could</i> -- MAYBE -- be made is that if the kid's life turns out just fine, it wasn't too bad to create him.  Just like an attempted murderer could say, of his surviving victim, ""sure I tried to murder him, but look -- the dude's doing <i>fine</i>!"".  Things may have turned out alright, but I wouldn't say that attempting to murder a person is acceptable (beyond the intentions involved).<p>If I gave you a wheelchair, you might ask me what the hell you need a wheelchair for.  Only after I have gnawed off your legs will it make sense.  Before this, you had no need for a wheelchair.  Similarly, the unborn have no need for a life that turns out just fine.<p>Procreation is never in the interest of the newborn.  Suffering is guaranteed.  Happiness cannot be used as a justification.

We will do so in a way that protects the interests of individual users as much as possible, given what the rest of the industry has already put into place.  We have selected Adobe to provide the key functionality. Adobe has been doing this in Flash for some time, and Adobe has been building the necessary relationships with the content owners. We believe that Adobe is uniquely able to bring new value to the setting.<p>Well, no, they added DRM to Firefox. They say so as much in as many apologetic ways that they can.<p>But agreed. There&#x27;s a spectrum between DRM-only software and DRM-capable software. Adobe is DRM-only. Firefox is DRM-capable.

Any competitor who wants into the market is going to charge a fee. The fact that nobody has succeeded in this in the American market means the market needs something that works first before fees become the issue. Apple can always lower the fee if they feel pressure. Remember that nay-sayers said the App Store 30% cut would never work because it was too high, but anybody who remembers this market before the App Store remembers that 3rd party payment services were often just as expensive if not more because you often had to do the labor of tying multiple services together (web site, shopping cart, payment authentication). Additionally, Apple promised and delivered in being able to draw in and convert more potential customers into buyers.<p>2) Inferior tech: Technology isn&#x27;t the problem. The technology has been around in other countries. There is something different about the American market that has prevented adoption of this kind of transaction system. Apple&#x27;s belief is it is the seamless integration, not the technology.<p>3) Little incentive for adopters: Self-interest may prove to be enough incentive. You only need to think back to McDonald&#x27;s and other fast-food&#x27;s semi-recent fight to remove credit card signatures from small transactions. They fought hard for this because their own market research found that signatures discouraged credit card transactions and slowed down lines. Their other research showed that people spent more money on average than compared to when they paid with cash (because they didn&#x27;t have to worry about not having enough cash on hand). Merchants may have enough self-interest to adopt this system in order to speed up lines (more customers with fewer cashiers) and get higher spending per customer.",1412738639

It&#x27;s a big system to get started & stopped, you need to get every part of the system to the proper temperature for quality steam, there are a bunch of lossy startup processes, etc. You can&#x27;t just throttle them up and down at will. The timeline is longer than a day for most of them.<p>Because of that they sell electricity at a discount at night. Large industrial users will schedule their entire operations around this. For example ski mountains do their snowmaking at night because the power is the greatest expense (even more than labor) and the discount is enormous. I also believe that aluminum and steel foundries do some form of this.<p>The renewables change this dynamic a bit, but there are many loads that can be time shifted. I could imagine an electric car connected to the internet and plugged in all night at home and all day at work could optimize its charging cycle to match the lowest energy prices of the day. Of course this requires major changes to metering and billing, but there is no technical reason why it couldn&#x27;t happen, it is all a business and infrastructure problem.",1412738132

Unblinded patients may differ from blinded ones in their way of reporting beneficial and harmful effects of treatment, in their tendency to seek additional treatment outside the study, and in their risk of dropping out of the study. Furthermore, unblinded staff may differ in their use of alternative forms of care and in their assessment of outcomes.

The unpredictability of wind and solar and the lack of a way to store their output effectively make dealing with these intermittent renewables challenging (and a thorn in the side) for grid management.  Due to the way electricity dispatch markets often work (<a href=""http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=7590"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=7590</a>), base-load style power plants (e.g. coal, nuclear, etc.) end up not being able to run or even paying to run.  This becomes a strong disincentive for the construction and operation of these plants that are vital for steady, dependable electricity supply.  The market structure in addition to the regulatory environment in the U.S. (e.g. requiring utilities to purchase all provided wind energy at higher than natural market price) are both part of the problem.  Cheap natural gas also hasn&#x27;t helped.  The Vermont Yankee nuclear plant closed due to energy prices being too cheap (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont_Yankee_Nuclear_Power_Plant#2013"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont_Yankee_Nuclear_Power_P...</a>).<p>[edit] grammar and paste fixes",1412737240

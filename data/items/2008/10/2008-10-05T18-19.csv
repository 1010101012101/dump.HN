324229,comment,324074,324074,0,0,hugh,,,"When I gamble, I do it because the pleasure I get from winning five dollars (""hah, take that, casino!"") is slightly larger than the pain I get from losing five dollars (""oh well, who cares?"").<p>I guess that truly rich people who gamble do it for similar reasons (though with numbers larger than five dollars). But poor people gamble because they (audaciously) hope to win enough money to change their lives. So I guess this explains why rich people play games with a high chance of getting a small payoff (blackjack, roulette) and poor people play games with a small chance of getting a huge payoff (slots, lotteries).",1223230933

The idea being that advertisements shouldn't be something odious that you sit through; they should draw you in and be relevant to your own desires.<p>I gave some thought to it last month but couldn't come up with any ideas on where to begin.  It's tricky: you're acting as middlemen between three parties (advertisers, site owners, and users) whose interests are usually (but not always) opposed, plus the chicken-and-egg problem of attracting advertisers before you've got sites and sites before you've got advertisers.<p>If my job hunt goes poorly I wouldn't mind spending some more time on this problem.  It's so obviously broken: companies aren't making many sales off Internet advertising, websites aren't making much money off advertisers, and users hate what the other two groups are doing.  For now I'm just trying to clean my open-source plate.",1223229785

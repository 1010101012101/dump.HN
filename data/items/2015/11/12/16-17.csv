10554343,comment,10554122,10554122,0,0,beejhuff,,,"Generally there are two approaches:<p>1) Hourly (most common) - determine what the standard rate is per hour for this kind of work in your area, then charge that, making an allowance (read: discount) for your level of skill.  This may or may not be done using a &quot;fixed price&quot; estimate, meaning you will charge for X number of hours no matter how long it actually takes you.  I&#x27;m not in your area, but my guess is that the fair market value of these services is probably in the $75-$150 range, depending on your level of expertise.<p>2) Value - determine the fair market value of the final output to the client and base your rate upon that estimate.  This is more difficult and prone to be influenced by factors you may not be aware of (ie, if this person&#x27;s relative implemented the site for free, they may attach an unreasonable expectation of value to the proposed change).<p>As I have progressed in my freelancing career I have found that one of the first set questions I always ask after having the client explain a request to me are:<p>1. What is your budget.  Making them start off the conversation about cost helps set expectations and allows me to immediately reject the request if their expectations are out of line with both the fair market value and my other active projects.<p>2. What is your timetable.  When a client needs a request done quickly and I have to reschedule already planned work to acommodate their request, I charge a premium for a rush job.  This is analogous to the way such requests are handled in other media segments like print, video, and audio production.",1447347499

It might of course just be such a bad idea that everybody smart enough to give high quality contributions on the topic does not want to waste their time with the idea. But if this is the case it is totally non obvious to me, and most criticism I&#x27;ve read seem to be from people that do not have a clear understanding of the potential advantages sortition might have.<p>Very briefly, for the uninitiated, the main potential advantage of sortition is that it would make political decision making a lot more democratic. People representative of the population at large would actually discuss to make the decision, instead of the citizens making their choice by casting one vote every few years among a set of very similar parties (I know, this simplifies the debate a lot, but it is the main idea). This is very interesting if you are of the opinion (as I am) that lack of democracy is a big problem of our political systems. I believe that most time politicians go agains the will of people they do so for the wrong reasons and with the wrong goals, and way too often.<p>The law of large number makes sure the randomness in sortition is limited and predictable. Whereas with elections there is a big number of arbitrary factors that can greatly influence the results.<p>Of course sortition in practice might have a number of problem often brought up, but none seems unsolvable to the point where it&#x27;s not even worth exploring the idea further.<p>How do you separate expertise from decision power, while still being able to make proper use of the expertise? How to implement sortition in practice? Would they ever let us? Would people be able to handle the pressure? Would they accept the position? And all criticism to democracy in general applies even more to sortition.<p>I think however that if you talked about elections to somebody who never heard about it, you could come up with just as a big number of potential problems. I don&#x27;t know if sortition really is a better idea, but maybe it&#x27;s an idea worth thinking about.<p>I recently read this article on sortition that appeared on the Atlantic which I think is really good: <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-a-college-admissions-lottery/361585/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/05/the-cas...</a><p>Another good starting point for further exploration is the blog Equality by Lot: <a href=""https://equalitybylot.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://equalitybylot.wordpress.com/</a>",1447346807

The reason selection by lot could work is that a large number of people were excluded from the pool.<p>&quot;Only adult male Athenian citizens who had completed their military training as ephebes had the right to vote in Athens. The percentage of the population that actually participated in the government was 10 to 20% of the total number of inhabitants, but this varied from the fifth to the fourth century BC. This excluded a majority of the population: slaves, freed slaves, children, women and metics (foreigners resident in Athens). The women had limited rights and privileges, had restricted movement in public, and were very segregated from the men. Also excluded from voting were citizens whose rights were under suspension (typically for failure to pay a debt to the city: see atimia); for some Athenians this amounted to permanent (and in fact inheritable) disqualification.&quot;\n<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy#Citizenship_in_Athens"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy#Citizenship...</a><p>&quot;In regards to Greek mythology, the ephebe was a young man or initiate, around the ages of 17-18, who was put through a period of isolation from his prior community, usually the world of his mother, where he was a child in the community.

This advantage is a combination of being more familiar and having better defaults.<p>Some ways that Sublime is more familiar are that it uses the OS-standard editing hotkeys, such as moving by words with Ctrl-arrows or Option-arrows. It also uses OS-standard terminology, like “close window” instead of “kill buffer” and “paste” instead of “yank”. The result is that new users don’t have to learn anything to be productive – they just edit as if they are in Microsoft Word, while enjoying the programming-specific features of a text editor such as syntax highlighting and block folding.<p>The better defaults include easily creating more than one scratch buffer (just run “New File” multiple times), automatically balancing parens when you type, support for pixel-by-pixel smooth scrolling, and scrollbars that don’t confusingly shrink when you start scrolling past the end of the buffer. I’m sure Emacs supports all these things, but you have to manually configure it to do so first.

Typing is of course important, the argument here is that for initial education, dynamic typing when these small programs are run is better than adding the complexity of declaring types, especially since so few are needed in an introduction course.<p>A CS (and EE, i.e. 6-3) or EECS (6-2, what most students major in today) major would learn CLU, later Java, when they took either the software engineering or compiler course.  And of course there were many opportunities to learn languages and get paid for programming, including the co-op program, which is now mostly formalized into a MEng program that most students do.<p>The dot.com crash cratered EECS enrollment, which had been steady at 40% of the undergraduate <i>for decades</i>, it dropped by more than half.  People panicked, Lisp haters made sure <i>all</i> of it was expunged from required undergraduate courses, and MIT just plain changed what it meant to be a MIT EECS graduate.  With a lot of surface politeness, here&#x27;s one for the record explanation: <a href=""http://www.wisdomandwonder.com/link/2110/why-mit-switched-from-scheme-to-python"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wisdomandwonder.com/link/2110/why-mit-switched-fr...</a><p>It&#x27;s now much more about making gadgets than, oh, trustworthy libraries.  Pity almost no one, proprietary or FOSS, provides any of the latter.  A portion of 6.001 is taught by the 6.001-zombies in January, with credit available for the first N who sign up, as 6.037, and if you don&#x27;t know Python when you arrive, there&#x27;s courses which will teach you it before you take the new 6.01 that pretends to start replacing 6.001.<p>Or, if you&#x27;re <i>really</i> serious about pure CS, you&#x27;re likely better off going to some place like CMU if you can get into the program.  (I got the impression some years ago when CS became popular again that Stanford is more like CMU and U.C. Berkeley more like MIT, but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true or still true.  If you&#x27;re serious about CS and can&#x27;t get into one of those 4 best in the world with no one close behind, you should think very carefully about your path forward.)",1447345494

Firefox&#x27;s source code is available, but if you aren&#x27;t verifying the source upon each update then that fact is largely irrelevant.<p>The whole point of OSS is to allow YOU to verify the software, and only then to build it when you&#x27;re comfortable. If you are skipping the verify step and definitely if you&#x27;re skipping the build step then the fact that it is OSS adds little to nothing security wise (since the vendor can splice in anything they want).<p>So even with OSS you often either trust the vendor or you do not.<p>> I think the reason OP points this out is because the old Sync system that Firefox had was much more secure (but unusable by the general public).

Since then\nI&#x27;ve spent a lot of time\naround low end business,\nand high end research \nmathematics, business, \nstartups, and computing.  \nSure, a lot of that \nexperience\nhas just junk quality information,\nbut the experience \ndoes let me\nhave some understanding\nof the people and cultures.\nBased on that understanding,\nthere are at least\nthree bottlenecks that \nhelp protect me:<p>(1) To duplicate my research,\nthe university research\nmathematicians would mostly\nneed a relatively \nclean formulation of the \nthe math part of the real\nbusiness \nproblem as a math problem.\nThat formulation\nrequires also understanding\nsome of my <i>business model</i>,\nwhich is not mathematics, \nin particular, what data\nto get and how to get it\nand, then, what the heck\ndata to give the users/customers\nthat they will like, a lot,\nand why.<p>E.g., \nfirst cut a lot of people\nwill say that I will need\nballpark 10^27 bytes of data.\nNope!  Just why not\nis a bit clever;\nalthough the basic\nreason is some solid\nmath, it&#x27;s a bit novel;\nalso need to understand and\nkeep in\nmind the business model;\nonly a small fraction of\nresearch mathematicians\nhave all the math prerequisites;\nand, net, \nonly a small fraction\nof people in pure\nmath would think of it.<p>Some of what I&#x27;m doing\nmost people who are close\nto such things will say\nI can&#x27;t do that.\nFor things close to what\nI&#x27;m doing, they are right.\nFor exactly what I&#x27;m doing,\nthey are wrong.  I found\na narrow path through the\nwoods that works for just\nwhat I&#x27;m doing.  If my\npath were broad instead\nof narrow, a lot of\nbooks would have to be\nrevised.<p>(2) The research I did is\nrelatively applied, \ni.e., would\nbe regarded by the research\nmathematics community as\na niche; then such\nmathematicians would have to\ndo the work of focusing on the\nniche; that would take them\naway from their main stream\nof research, get them few or\nno academic promotion points,\nand is something they wouldn&#x27;t\nwant to do.<p>(3) Even among\ngood university research mathematicians, some of the\ncrucial math prerequisites are not well understood.<p>For a human, there\nis little so obscure as\nsome math theorems and\nproofs where the human\nis missing the important\nprerequisites.<p>Outside of university research\nmath departments, the chances\nof anyone even being able to\nduplicate my work is much smaller.<p>Then there is the issue of\n<i>business</i>:  The university\nresearch mathematicians\nare a very long way <i>culturally</i>\nfrom a startup in <i>information\ntechnology</i>; they \ndon&#x27;t have nearly enough background in the basic computing; \ne.g., they don&#x27;t really know\nin any good detail how a Web server works, \nor TCP/IP,\nknow an appropriate \nprogramming\nlanguage, understand\nserver farm system management,\netc.<p>Then in business, they don&#x27;t understand information technology\nstartups.  E.g., they haven&#x27;t\nbeen reading Hacker News,\nVentureBeat, AVC.com, Mark Andreessen, etc.<p>They couldn&#x27;t, and\neven if they could likely wouldn&#x27;t, do the work alone (too\nbig of a distraction \nfrom their\nuniversity research career)\nand with just the math \nwouldn&#x27;t be able to attract\na team without some significant\nbucks.  Further, for a VC, \na professor with a math\npaper and a dime won&#x27;t cover\na 10 cent cup of coffee.<p>My effort is yet another\nexample of something classic\nin innovation -- field crossing.\nSo, for the <i>fields</i>,\nthere are some advanced\nmath prerequisites,\nsome understanding of\nsome niche topics in\npure and applied math,\nthe particular, niche \nmath research I did,\nthe computing, and, to\ntie it all together, \nthe whole business model\nI have in mind.<p>So, early on, no one will\nbother trying to compete with\nme.  Later I will have\nsome barriers to entry\nfrom the data I&#x27;ve gathered,\nsome viral and network effects,\nsome happy users who won&#x27;t\nt want to try something\nelse or pay <i>switching costs</i>,\nand will have some publicity, and a brand name.<p>Or, until I&#x27;m quite successful, people who could do the\nmath couldn&#x27;t easily and \nwouldn&#x27;t do the rest; the people who \ncould and would do the rest\nwon&#x27;t do the math;\nand no one with a suitable\ncheckbook would cough up\nenough money to put\na team together that\ncould do all the required\n<i>field crossing</i>.  Later?\nMostly too late unless\nsomeone wants to buy me\nout and I&#x27;m willing to sell.<p>> Obviously you are the only person writing your code, but should you assume that someone with a similar background could not come up with something quite similar if he wanted to research it?<p>The &quot;code&quot; is not the point.\nThe crucial, core point\nis the math.  Given the\nmath, nearly all the code\nis quite routine, and the\nrest is not much more \ndifficult.  The real, core\ntechnical challenge of the\ncode is the math in the\n<i>design and specifications \ndocument</i> for the code.<p>Saying that I did some\nmath research doesn&#x27;t \ngive away much; it just \nputs one in the QA section\nof a research library with\nracks and racks of books\nand journals where one\ncan easily get totally lost\nfor many lifetimes.

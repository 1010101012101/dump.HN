As far as awareness of the immediacy of death; well I believe that death is simply part of life - so that won't work for me.  Although if you mean awareness of the immediacy of death - as in Carpe Diem - I'm all with ya!",1207828130

159808,comment,159493,159718,0,0,rp,,,"Wouldn't the declining value of Yahoo over time have something to do with it? Yahoo stock was as high as $30 in early 2007 and was trading at under $20 when Microsoft made the announcement. Certainly the stock price has bumped up but imagine what Microsoft would have to put up if Yahoo was trading at $30 before this potential deal was announced.<p>Also, we have yet to see what price the Yahoo board would actually sell at. In light of their saggy long-term growth outlook and numerous attempts to run away from the deal (deals or mergers with Google or AOL) a decent stock bump from a News Corp/Microsoft combination would test their sincerity re: a higher price.",1207827381

If you want to learn about things like preemptive multi-threading, virtual memory etc... you might be better served looking at something like Minix or XINU.  Not to mention that C code is going to be easier to wrap your head around than all assembler.<p><a href=""http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/xinu.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/xinu.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dec/xsoft.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dec/xsoft.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.minix3.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.minix3.org/</a>",1207826313

Yahoo-Microsoft, given the current state of things, is the only reasonable outcome.""<p>I'm not one to much like Microsoft, but they are starting to come to market with decent web products. Combine Microsoft and Yahoo and you've got a pretty big web powerhouse that has a _chance_ at giving Google a run for it's money. That is unless, like the article said, all of Yahoo's top people find new jobs.",1207825695

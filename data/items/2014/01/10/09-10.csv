Given Bitcoin rate greatly varies, if it Bitcoin is dropping, I won&#x27;t buy as then I will have to spend more coins. If it&#x27;s on the rise, I will wait more to spend less. In general, too much wondering to get the best deal. If price is in BTC and I own BTC, I buy when I need something without having to worry about it.

Netherland has tons of youth sports, but all in indepdent, often volunteer-run clubs. For many sports (football and hockey[0] at least) there&#x27;s a youth league for every two-year age group, and after the last one, when you&#x27;re 18, you move to the adult leagues. Those are generally amateur leagues, but professional football clubs have their own youth programs (playing in the same leagues) and recruit from all clubs in the vicinity (not to mention rival clubs and foreign countries).<p>[0] And here I mean the football where a round ball is played with the foot, rather than American Football; and the hockey that&#x27;s played on a field, rather than ice hockey.",1389347756

Sports might be seen as some kind of ritualized conflict, I guess, but then how is that different than any other kind of gameplay?

It&#x27;s damned fun, which is a worthy end in itself, and I believe that chess play hones the mind even as it entertains the players.<p>Likewise, sports are fun!  But if you need further justification, their play teaches us valuable physical and social skills - teamwork, graciousness, poise, coordination, fitness, and so on - that even if you aren&#x27;t entertained by a particular sport, surely you can see its potential value in other dimensions.<p>I guess my point is that not all human education is intellectual.

7206872,comment,7206090,7206436,5,0,rayiner,,,"I suggest you inform yourself about the gestation process. I used to think the same way, but when we had my daughter I was surprised how early everything happened. First, embryonic age is measured from the date of the last missed period. So even people who find out early are already several weeks along. By six weeks, before many women even realize they are pregnant, the embryo has a heartbeat. By 13 weeks, most of the basic functionality is already there. By 24 weeks, or the time the baby is a pound and and a half, the fetus isn&#x27;t a glob, but a fully recognizable, if fragile, human. Much of the development after that is external: hair, subcutaneous fat, etc. I don&#x27;t know what you consider a coherent thought, but at our 24 week ultrasound our baby already responded as we tried to push her into a position to check her gender. I don&#x27;t think infants who are born full term are more intellectually sophisticated in some fundamental way.<p>Yes, this has implications for abortion. I support abortion rights, but the &quot;its just a ball of cells&quot; is a rationale that isn&#x27;t convincing after week 6-9. And lines drawn on intellectual abilities don&#x27;t justify in a principled way why it isn&#x27;t okay to abort full term babies. Lines based on viability are susceptible to the progress of medical technology. The typical 24-26 week line we use is fairly arbitrary in all three regards.",1391975683

It averages about $7MM. The &quot;extraordinary&quot; expense of this child actually only requires a 14% increase in value over the average citizen to make sense.<p>Most importantly though, we must recognize that the actual cost is actually just the cost of risk spread across society, so instead of one person taking the brunt of this cost, we as a society take it together. As a whole, it is negligible on all of us, and it&#x27;s a risk that any of us can fall into. The value of having a system that supports each other is invaluable. Way more valuable than a measly $1MM. We have strength in numbers and we all benefit when a society supports each other. If we ostracize the statistical outliers in this support system, then the support system itself (the one which we all benefit from) falls apart.<p>In short, more important than the economic argument (which I argue, still makes sense to spend $1MM on a baby), is the argument that the value to society from supporting each other results in a negligible cost for individuals and a near-priceless benefit to everyone within that society. It&#x27;s exceptionally difficult to put a price tag on that, and it&#x27;s orders of magnitude higher than $1MM.",1391975416

A patient in an ICU will typically have a DRG associated with him/her. This DRG relates to the acuity, and these in turn, impact the reimbursement level. This is because the complexity of care, as indicated by the acuity level, implies higher resource utilization. For instance, the patient-nurse ratio in a typical hospital room is somewhere right around 4:1. In ICUs this ratio is, more often, 1:1. The ICU also needs an array of techs for a patient... highly specialized techs capable of analyzing and acting on information coming off of the monitor that the tech is responsible for.<p>So hospitals are not saying, &quot;Hey... we have these people here who we can get a lot of money out of!&quot; The system, as it currently stands, is &quot;volume based&quot;, so money comes in for ICU care regardless of what the hospital wants. One of the issues with being volume based in this fashion, is that money does NOT come in for things like data analytics, nutrition departments and occupational therapy for instance. Now here&#x27;s the rub... how do you offer comprehensive ICU care without due consideration of nutrition? Without the ability and expertise to analyze the data coming off of what could very well be an extensive array of monitoring equipment?<p>It actually goes further than that... Most hospitals MUST have a clinical equipment department for which they are not reimbursed at all. Of course, the creation of an ICU withOUT a clinical equipment department is out of the question.<p>So while there do exist cross subsidies in any given hospital, it misses the mark to view the departments on the receiving end of the subsidies as &quot;money losing&quot;. This sort of thinking has led the industry to all of the issues we see presently. A good example is the poor reimbursement of primary care... and so primary care becomes &quot;money losing&quot; when viewed in that manner. Instead, I think these departments would better be viewed in the fashion that they are viewed in the &quot;value based&quot; reimbursement regime that the industry is currently transitioning to.<p>Not only will care delivery facilities be in a better position to provide care to families like your own and others, but the quality of care will increase across that enterprise. Your family was given high quality care because the hospital took money from a &quot;volume based&quot; reimbursement system, and distributed those monies based on the judgement of what were probably some very clever &quot;value based&quot; administrators. I can pretty much guarantee you that they did not view Clinical Equipment, Data Analytics or Nutrition as &quot;money losing&quot; departments.<p>One of the things that has been missing in the discussion about the health care system is the education of the typical citizen about the tradeoffs and compromises that, for example, hospitals are making internally to deliver the quality of care that they do. I think if the citizenry had a more full understanding of the nuances of things like the reimbursement system, we could have a more productive debate on the issue of healthcare.",1391975128

There are several ways to solve this, all of which boil down to &quot;use more chips&quot; or &quot;use better speakers&quot;, thus increasing the price of already incredibly shitty speakers. Source: I&#x27;m involved in designing consumer electronic products and the only corners that don&#x27;t get cut are those that, if cut, result in certifications not being granted and therefore in products you&#x27;re unable to sell. Everyone, Apple included, does it.<p>The easiest way to solve this is use stronger materials for the speaker construction. This does, yes, affect the quality of the sound, which is already somewhere between catastrophic and abysmal on a laptop. The frequency response is likely to be worse, on a set of speakers that already has a frequency response that makes them quite useless for music.<p>You can also do it in electronics, as measuring the power delivered to speakers is not exactly rocket science. The response time wouldn&#x27;t be great, but it&#x27;s continuously shredding the speakers with square signals that damages them, not a couple of pulses every once in a while. You can also detect heavy slopes. You can even detect heavy slopes <i>in software</i>.<p>But no, seriously, this is a problem that can be solved. The mere fact that a lot of manufacturers manage to come up with speakers that don&#x27;t break should be a testimony to this.

C is not the best or even a particularly good language to try to learn abstract CS concepts with, professors who choose it are needlessly stressing out their students, and at the end of the day you can learn a lot more about algorithms and data structures when you are not busy worrying about pointers or trying to avoid the things that &quot;everyone knows to avoid&quot; (except people keep failing to do so).<p>I say this as someone who watched the catastrophic results of trying to use C++ as a language to teach data structures.

Even the wikipedia page describes them badly.<p>The Condorcet criteria itself is easy.  If a candidate would beat every other candidate in a one-on-one matchup, that candidate should be the winner.  There, that&#x27;s it.<p>That&#x27;s really how it should be described.  And then as a next step, we can then describe &quot;tiebreakers&quot;.  Instead, wikipedia (and others) describe Condorcet only in terms of their tiebreakers, making Condorcet methods themselves appear flawed[1].<p>You see, loops are possible.  In a vote, it&#x27;s possible that A would always beat B, B would always beat C, and C would always beat A.  And the various Condorcet tiebreakers (like Schulz) are ways to resolve those situations.<p>But the point is, if that happens, the vote really is accurately uncovering an indecisiveness that actually exists in the voting population.  So it makes sense that a &quot;tiebreaker&quot; would be non-ideal in some sense.  And they all are in some way.  The problem is not with the tiebreaking methods.  The problem is with the voting population.<p>I&#x27;ve always thought a good voting system would be the following:<p>First, rank the votes.  If a Condorcet winner exists, the election is over.  If not, restrict the candidate pool to the Schwartz set, and start a new round of campaigning so the voting population can research more and better educate themselves.<p>[1].  Yes, we can argue that the Condorcet criteria is &quot;perfect&quot; if a Condorcet Winner exists, with one caveat: it implies the value that all votes have equal value.  If you have that value, it&#x27;s a logical implication that the Condorcet Winner (if it exists) should be the winner.  But other values are possible, such as a utilitarian mindset of wanting to meet greatest social utility, such as some voters being far more passionate or educated than others.  Following those implications bring up other tricky problems, though.",1391974286

You&#x27;re responsible for revenue, which is something that most companies will want lots of at some point or another.<p>--Because you&#x27;re responsible for revenue, you can personally make lots of money. In SF, a good salesperson (even at a  startup) can easily make $75-125k/yr in their first year or two. If you go to a larger company, have specialized experience, or are exceptional at sales, it&#x27;s not uncommon to be making $150-200k+/yr after a couple years.<p>--Arguably, even more important than the financial benefits, you&#x27;ll learn a ton about business. Even if you don&#x27;t see yourself becoming a career salesperson, it&#x27;s a great base to launch a career in operations, account management, strategic partnerships, revenue/sales management, or to become a CEO/COO/CRO of your own company someday. Sales is valuable because every company has to do it - whether pitching investors, negotiating a contract, selling SaaS products, partnering with other companies, etc. It&#x27;s all sales on some level.<p>Feel free to email me if you&#x27;d like to discuss further.

7206636,comment,7205385,7206047,1,0,ronaldx,,,">A well-taught computer science course will not force anyone to rote-learn algorithms.<p>Agree but with the correction that you mean well-structured computer science course. The UK national A-level syllabus for &quot;Decision 1&quot;, that which is under discussion, largely demands rote-learning for the examination. To avoid this, for whatever reason, would be very poor teaching.<p>There are structural deficiencies here, which teaching cannot overcome. (Also worth noting that this is part of the HS <i>maths</i> course, and mathematics teachers are typically not knowledgeable enough to offer the flavour you demand)<p>> Instead it ought to walk the students through the discovery process of improving from a naive but simple bubble sort, through more complicated algorithms.<p>Bubblesort is not naive and simple. Given the opportunity to invent a sorting algorithm from scratch, as a total beginner or as an expert, nobody would spontaneously suggest bubblesort in 2013.<p>Here is a more complete criticism of using bubblesort as an educational tool: <a href=""http://www.cs.duke.edu/~ola/papers/bubble.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.duke.edu/~ola/papers/bubble.pdf</a><p>If you <i>open</i> your course with bubblesort, it&#x27;s my belief that a lot of capable students are going to be thinking &quot;why did we start here? => computer science is not for me&quot;.<p>Overall, I agree with your teaching method - but bubblesort to quicksort is the wrong route. If sorting algorithms are introduced (I don&#x27;t think it is a good <i>start</i> point), insertion/selection sort to bucket sort would be more pedagogical. The start point more closely matches students&#x27; naive understanding, and the end point forces teachers to be more clear about what the key learning points are.",1391973027

(France changed their standard in 2008-2009; their page defining stillbirth ( <a href=""http://www.insee.fr/en/methodes/default.asp?page=definitions/enfant-sans-vie.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.insee.fr/en/methodes/default.asp?page=definitions...</a> ) now includes a warning that French numbers cannot be compared to other European neonatal mortality numbers, so it seems safe to assume the rest of Europe has carried on as before.)<p>> According to the way statistics are calculated in Canada, Germany, and Austria, a premature baby weighing <500g is not considered a living child.<p>The article baby weighed well over 500g.  But this is quite relevant to the question of who has better neonatal mortality.<p>> In Switzerland and other parts of Europe, a baby born who is less than 30 centimeters long is not counted as a live birth. Therefore, unlike in the U.S., such high-risk infants cannot affect Swiss infant mortality rates.<p>This baby&#x27;s length is not reported, so this is of questionable relevance to this particular baby.  But, again, it remains very relevant to the question of &quot;do countries like Finland, France, and Cuba have better neonatal mortality than the US?&quot;<p>> If a child in Hong Kong or Japan is born alive but dies within the first 24 hours of birth, he or she is reported as a “miscarriage” and does not affect the country’s reported infant mortality rates.<p>This could be a non-premature, 8-pound baby!<p>> Efforts to salvage these tiny babies reflect this classification. Since 2000, 42 of the world’s 52 surviving babies weighing less than 400g (0.9 lbs.) were born in the United States.<p>Still think &quot;USD-tinted healthcare analytics&quot; biases you <i>against</i> saving premature babies?<p>Full disclosure: I&#x27;m with your parent; I consider spending so much pumping life into these very premature &quot;babies&quot; a self-aggrandizing waste of time, effort, and money.

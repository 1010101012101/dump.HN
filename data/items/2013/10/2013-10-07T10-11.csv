This could and should apply equally to teams as well as individuals working alone (albeit taking different approaches to working).<p>What&#x27;s interesting here is the comparison between achieving something as a team/in an organisation and working alone, which is ultimately what the author is advocating in order to gain certain freedoms. However, it seems to me that one can only achieve so much as an individual and this includes effecting change on a large scale because it takes many hands and cooperation to stir a big pot.",1381143565

Say you plan to spend $2k on rent for the indefinite future. That&#x27;s $24k per year, $240k per decade, etc. Are you insolvent if you don&#x27;t have all that in the bank now? No, of course not.

A home is not guaranteed.  But I think I&#x27;d rather be poor in the UK than in many other countries.  There is a possibility of housing (for a subset of the people who need housing); there is free health care for all who want it, including free medication for some of the people who need it (and low cost medication for the rest).",1381140349

The main risk is that interest payments get out of control, which is what made Greece go bankrupt. Or, of course, that a country refuses to take on new debt to fund old debt, like the House is now threatening to do.<p>Of course threatening to default is also likely to make interest payments spiral out of control. But if the country pays its debts in a timely manner and keeps total interest under control, it can keep this up forever.",1381140103

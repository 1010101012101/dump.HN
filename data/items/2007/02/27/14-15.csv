1362,comment,1328,1328,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Stanford is an interesting place. On one hand, it is the birthplace of the Silicon Valley school, a movement that believes the best way to measure the value of a person is by what they can do for others. Contrasted with meritocracy, what others say you can do as opposed to what you can actually do, this seems to be a more empowering and productive economic and political philosophy than anything in the history of humanity.<p>On the other hand, it&#39;s also the birthplace of intelligence testing and the American eugenics movement, and played a major role in creating the ideological foundations of the holocaust.<p>Both traditions are very much alive and kicking around there today, and what the people you talk to believe depends very much on which side of campus you&#39;re on. <p>It seems to be working out for the students though.

I know I can&#39;t get specifics, but I&#39;m curious in general what is different in this application that commercial gyros were not capable.  Any info would scratch my itch!  Thanks!",1172586013
1357,comment,1340,1340,0,0,mattculbreth,,,"Reddit is still good by me if we can just get the political stuff out of there.  I don&#39;t mind a few good stories here and there, but it&#39;s become completely overpowering, especially in the Hot list.  If you use programming.reddit.com you&#39;re in good shape.  Still good stories, and any submission you make can still get some traction if people like it.  General stories though get clobbered by the relentless Iraq/Iran/Bush/Anna-Nicole/Cheney/RandomGayPastor element.\n",1172585784

It will take a significant technology step forward for a new startup to get traction.&#34;<p>Seemed to be room for something like news.YC (yah, I know it&#39;s a much smaller niche).  It&#39;s the social networking side that findory is missing, which, BTW, is why it&#39;s cool, but not in the same category as digg and reddit.

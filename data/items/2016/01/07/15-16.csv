Things like the fixed christmas bonus will be paid to 80%.<p>> The worst possible scenario would be workers switching to shorter work weeks, accepting pay cuts and loss of benefits, and proceeding to be more productive for their employer.

What matters to me is I now have an extra day every week to do something that I actually want to be doing, rather than working for someone else.<p>Put another way, if you feel like your skills are undervalued, talk to your employer about a raise.

The important thing is to be the one who listens and makes things better for the engineers so they have what they need to build a great product.<p>The salary part sucks, yeah.  I basically had to moonlight when I was working as a CTO.  This is where I would really advise you put some serious thought as to whether or not you would really be committed to this startup, because in all likelihood you&#x27;ll wind up with a full-time-plus job as an underpaid executive, and you&#x27;ll have to moonlight on the side in order to make up for the remainder of the unpaid bills.  You won&#x27;t have a whole lot of time for side-projects, if any at all.  Not for a while anyway.<p>But seriously, don&#x27;t worry about failure.  As long as you listen you should be okay.  Even if you&#x27;re not, you&#x27;ll still learn something, and it&#x27;ll be really valuable for the next phase of your life.  Case in point: I&#x27;m building my own startup now, and I have more confidence going into it because of the lessons I learned.<p>Oh, and one more final takeaway.  You&#x27;ll have to do some fighting.  Your job as CTO of is to lead the technical element of the company, but fellow executives, or your boss, may occasionally step on your toes.  Sometimes they&#x27;re right, sometimes they&#x27;re wrong.  When they&#x27;re wrong, stand up for yourself, be diplomatic about it, but don&#x27;t be a pushover about it, and back up your case with some evidence.  You&#x27;ll win some and lose some, just try not to lose too many crucial battles.",1452181878

The point is all the <i>other</i> hardware has much larger changes to make than just &quot;extending an address&quot;. It&#x27;s a brand new protocol, not an extension.<p>I&#x27;ve been involved in some relatively <i>trivial</i> extension of application-level network devices to IPv6, and even <i>that</i> was a surprisingly large nightmare because you embed all these assumptions about addresses everywhere without even realizing it. Not just &quot;they&#x27;re a 4-byte integer&quot;; one big one you embed without even realizing it pretty deeply is that &quot;A network address is <i>one type</i>.&quot; In dual-stack code, you no longer have &quot;an address&quot;. You have two types. That&#x27;s just an example of the problem.<p>I think perhaps anyone who is opining on how easy this should be should also mention whether or not they&#x27;ve tried to convert an application or a network device to IPv6 or not, because I&#x27;ve seen even within a network company a lot of severe underestimations of the difficulty. (Some of these things are much easier when you write new code for IPv4+IPv6, which is why I say <i>convert</i>. Of course if you write new code on an abstraction layer that already solved this problem it&#x27;s easier.) IPv6 <i>is not</i> IPv4, quite profoundly. It&#x27;s not just addressing changes. Converting to IPv6 <i>is not</i> just &quot;replacing all your gear&quot;, it is <i>rewriting foundational aspects</i> of all that gear and a non-trivial amount of the software that uses it.

Transitioning to something like BangIP might be much easier, but it will be impossible to force people to adopt it, which will only lead to fragmentation. IPv6 might cause massive fragmentation on the internet right now, but once the IPv6 gets closer to 100% we can start dismantling the IPv4 infrastructure, which will force the remaining few to switch to IPv6. There&#x27;s no way to do that with BangIP, as it involves keeping the IPv4 infrastructure intact, which will allow people to continue browsing a large part of the web and thus there will be little to no reason for a lot of people to switch to BangIP. In the end IPv6 will be a much better solution than BangIP.",1452181554

The vast majority of people on gluten-free diets do not have any gluten allergy. But, as you said, cutting down carbs would vastly improve the health of most Americans. So, cutting out gluten also cuts down on carbs which leads to a healthy outcome, even though there is actually no reason for them to cut down on gluten itself.<p>So their reason for cutting down on carbs is wrong, but the final effect is good.

Would that be defeating the ultimate goal of improving their health?<p>In the end, mostly I just butt out.

I would like you to explain exactly how the police may identify whether the object that appears to be a weapon is an actual weapon other than waiting for the suspect to fire first.<p>Again, we should just hope that innocent bystanders are not hit by that first shot at police as they hide behind their defensive positions and superior equipment? Police officers and innocent bystanders don&#x27;t always fare too well when the police are obligated to follow stupid rules of engagement.<p>> Some people say the suspect should be shot in all four scenarios (after all, he might shoot!). I disagree.<p>See, that&#x27;s where I agree with you. Because none of the scenarios in your list is a reason for police officers to fire as you list them. But tack on the end of each item that the suspect acted in a threatening manner with an object that appeared to be a weapon then the police officer may choose to fire their weapon. To be fair, if the suspect tried to run down other people or cops during the chase to show that he was a threat then just getting out of the car with an object that appeared to be a weapon will get him shot.

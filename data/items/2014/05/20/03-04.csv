If you are too busy, quit your job and stay home. To maintain the quality of life that existed while Keynes wrote this book, a single income is often adequate. It&#x27;s not worth killing yourself over.<p>I think what much of what explains the wealth gap is free trade and illegal immigration. We import everything from China today. We would not allow these sweat-shops in our country with children working in dangerous conditions for pennies an hour. We wouldn&#x27;t allow it here, but we do support it by buying these products. This breaks the whole premise that Keynes was basing his predictions on (Illegal immigrant employment as well).

But the contracts are decided by a simple majority vote, and the senior pilots are a small minority (and often not even the negotiators): &quot;Senior Pilots make up the the smallest percentage of any Pilot Group, so they are not in control of what passes. Often, Contracts are passed with improvements for junior pilots that outstrip the improvements for senior pilots. I have seen this happen, and if you are in this Industry a little longer, you will, too.&quot;<p>(So why do junior pilots accept low entry-level wages at regional airlines? Same as any entry level employee: Hope for training to move up to the next rung.)<p>-Philip says the airlines are severely constrained in fighting strikes, but neglects to mention that the pilots are also severely constrained in when they can strike. &quot;Getting the the NLRB to release a union to strike takes years, which benefits the Airline by keeping the Pilots working under the old Contract for as many as 5 or 6 additional years&quot;",1400555522

What happens when you catch RudderNotRespondingException(&quot;I tried to turn the rudder to 24.3 degrees and nothing happened.&quot;) Most likely you lost feedback, but maybe the rudder actually didn&#x27;t turn to 24.3 degrees. When does the autopilot realize that it can&#x27;t make it to the destination. Does the ship stop and wait for a tech to be helicoptered in to plug the rudder feedback cable back in?<p>Thats one of about 1000000 things that could go wrong that an experienced engineer would have little trouble diagnosing and fixing or working around, that are much more significant challenges for a computer making decisions.  Just looking at the complexity of the engine room you can imagine all the possible points of failure, and the number of required contingency behaviors for the autopilot explodes when you start taking 2, 3, or more at a time.",1400555518

You are insanely good at reading between the lines.<p>I don&#x27;t let it get me down that my adviser doesn&#x27;t give me that much approval, because I&#x27;m not in it to get his approval. I also don&#x27;t let it get me down that he doesn&#x27;t think my work is that much of a contribution, because I genuinely do believe it is.<p>I did let that stuff get me down for a long time, so I have been miserable part of the time, but I have learned an important life lesson about not letting your own self-esteem come from other people&#x27;s standards. You have to set your own standards and do your own thinking and evaluation. This is true in all areas of life, but it&#x27;s super important for self-esteem.<p>I don&#x27;t think my adviser is just using me to help his career. He&#x27;s too established to need that. It&#x27;s just not a factor. That is definitely something to look out for in academia but not all professors are that hardcore/machiavellian.<p>Your questions may have been purely rhetorical, but in case not, my plan is to finish my doctorate and then most likely go on to become a practicing (i.e. non-academic) computer scientist.<p>I do think all this is worth it in terms of not spending much time with my family (I mean my parents&#x27; generation, as I&#x27;m not married and have no kids) on holidays. It would have been a much larger tradeoff if I had had much social (friends/romantic) prospects, but I don&#x27;t think I really would have done much better outside of grad school (my best years are still ahead of me in all that kind of stuff). And I do have some really good colleagues that basically are friends, AND I get to do real computer science full time, which is basically a dream come true.",1400555406

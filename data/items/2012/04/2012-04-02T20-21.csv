3790054,comment,3789674,3789674,1,0,toddnessa,,,"When I was searching for a domain name for my startup idea, it became very evident to me rather quickly that a number of domain squatters have used the dictionary to snap up domain names. Let me first say that I really don't have an issue with someone purchasing a domain that goes along with an idea that they do intend to use at some reasonable future time. However, I do have an issue with those who search the dictionary for every possible domain name that someone with an idea might want to later use in order to later profit off of you and your idea. To combat this, I found myself having to come up with a creative variation of what I initially wanted to use in order to register a domain. In the end, I feel it benefited my creativity and led to a really catchy name. It is nice to now be aware of a tool that can help someone facing this process and hope that it falls only in the right hands.",1333400311

Go to a big college in a nice college town, party my ass off, take a bunch of classes in every subject imaginable, and see what interests me. Then, do something in that area, diploma or no.

The beauty of adopting a craft paradigm like programming lies in how it fails - All problems in programming are ultimately problems in dealing with our own intuitions about the mechanics of the world and our rationality, and the problematic interplay between those two agencies.<p>The very semantics of how we describe language advantages and disadvantages reflect this.<p>""Everything you manipulate is an object, and the results of those manipulations are themselves objects. However, many languages make the same claim, and their users often have a different interpretation of what object-oriented means and a different terminology for the concepts they employ.""<p>Was that Jacques Lacan? Actually that's the pitch of the hit OOP dynamic language Ruby.<p>I think this is endlessly valuable to young people -- as so many programmers can attest, the key to solving errors seems to be in radical reassessments of your frame and mode of thinking: the nature of the solution to problems in programming isn't about abandoning rationality, as much as it is expanding the nature of rationality into solution sets such that the problem can be solved adequately. I don't think it's at all unscientific to say that when theres billions of hidden local variables at play in a machine, in some way, you have to put yourself at the mercy of a higher power (whatever that designation may imply).<p>Despite this, you still are the one in control. This is why I think software has something very important to offer kids for this dawning century. As a culture we're losing the real virtues of thinking passionately, of having a sense of responsibility for who you are, making something of your work and feeling good about your work and life in general.<p>Software, hacking, or whatever you'd like to call it gives you the undeniable feeling that your life is yours to create. Although it's a art mired in abstractions, it's incredibly concrete -- It's you reading this right now, making decisions, it lets you know that although it's true that theres about 7 billion people in the world, WHAT YOU DO MATTERS, not abstractly, but in material terms. A recurring message I see here in this thread is that software allows us to stop writing ourselves off and to stop seeing ourselves as the victim of a confluence of forces, despite us ultimately having no control of the machine beyond our own thoughts, no matter how aged, wizened or jaded with the craft we become.",1333399917

3790015,comment,3789351,3789351,1,0,joejohnson,,,"I think the author makes some good points, but for the wrong reasons.  A lot of the issues he complains about (lateness policies, taking the ""fun"" out of learning, ...) stem from other skills that HS is attempting to teach.  He is correct in assuming that these skills are important for a student entering college.<p>However, I think he was on the right track when he wrote ""High school isn’t educational because it incentivizes a credential only meaningful to universities instead of educating students.""  This isn't entirely true; high school students will learn things that will be useful even if they don't attend college.  But much of the material of a high school education (and the way it is taught) supports the college-preparatory model.<p>Many students would do well to enter a trade school at an earlier age.  Perhaps the US high school education system could be streamlined if students decide which track they were on earlier.  Students who were set on college would continue with the traditional HS model, while trade school students could begin vocational training at age 16 or 17.<p>The real root of this issue is that there <i>is</i> a demand for workers (in the US economy) with skills above that of a HS diploma, but below that of a bachelors degree.  These certifications are specialized trade skills.  These jobs are relatively well-paying and continue an American economic tradition of entry-level jobs which enable workers to work their way into the middle class.<p>However, trade schools are looked down upon.  Many people go to college and end up working in jobs which they are (supposedly) over qualified for.

One is an exercise in the free speech the other is the victimization of a person.

In the past, it was common to have having multiple untrusted users in one system. Outside of universities that is now uncommon.<p>It's much more typical to have one operator own (or a small team share) a large number of unix hosts. The common models here for dealing with privileges are more an exercise in getting aroung it than leveraging it.<p>One model is to have an app user that everyone logs in as. This reduces the change of people making a mistake when they're root, but it's hard to know who did what.<p>Another model has each person have a unique user. They log in as themselves and then sudo to application users. It's a fair bit of work to set up, and once you have you still don't get to see who ran what command.<p>In theory you can set things up so that everyone is in the same group, but there's fiddly problems when you do this. Like you can't copy over someone else's file (even if you're in the group and it's 775), you have to first delete it and then copy in its place.<p>A model I'd prefer would be to have a gateway OS housing multiple VMs. A vm would have full rwx access to a mount point on a filesystem. Any user within the vm would have full permissions. The system would log into the gateway system.

You can manipulate GLD down by issuing naked shorts (essentially counterfeited against collateral).  But you can't counterfeit Bitcoin.  If you want to drop the market price of Bitcoin, you have to sell actual BC that you had before and don't have now.<p>Then, to actually profit, you have to find a way to buy those BC back for less than you sold for.  This isn't going to happen unless your smart algo finds an equal and opposite stupid algo that it can rape.  Who gets raped and why?<p>(If you ask me, it's BC that's a well-designed market and Wall Street that's a funky, broken anachronism.  A lot of stupid pointless volatility would go away if we eliminated synthetic securities and lenders of last resort, and replaced the ancient order-matching system with a central limit-order book.  Then, you'd have to actually add information to the system in order to profit - rather than profiting by raping other algos, and more plausibly retail traders, with ""sharktooth and band-burst."")",1333397108

It turns out that CG typically prefers the CPU for its its drawing. In comparison, when you load images into a UIImageView, you know that the drawing will be done on the GPU, instead.<p>Quick question: How does UIImage's -drawInRect: and -drawAtPoint: differ?[1]<p><i>With that in mind, I think most people are better off using a tool like this to produce PDF data rather than raw CG calls, and use generic code to render that PDF data to a UIImage</i><p>The CGPDFPage* functions that Apple provides are document-oriented (remember: the D in PDF stands for ""document""), and don't necessarily work well in all cases, either. A compromise could be to render your CG calls into a context that is then turned into a UIImage that gets cached and stuck into a UIImageView for display. This way, you can do your drawing in CG*, get GPU-backed rendering, and don't have to deal with clumsy PDFs to get images.<p>So, my advice? Click the ""buy"" button. Drawing in code is just another tool to have. No reason to avoid doing so, if the situation calls for it -- and the trick to any tool is knowing when to use it.<p>1. If you guessed that -drawInRect is CPU-backed and drawAtPoint: is GPU-backed, pat yourself on the back. Simply having your resources in a UIImage isn't enough to guarantee GPU-backed drawing.
